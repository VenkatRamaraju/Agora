Recent headlines and conversations for AAPL
"There is talk of the next AppleWatch having non-invasive Glucose Monitoring. That would be huge for diabetics or anyone who is interested in tracking their blood sugar. I really can't believe Apple has found a way to do something that is practically the Holy Grail in health tracking, something that many medical companies have been trying to do for years and failed. It almost sounds too good to be true and I hope it's not some internet prank. AppleWatches will be flying off the shelves and plenty of people will be upgrading right away just to have that feature. I hope Apple has the feature thoroughly patented so their IP isn't stolen immediately. Apple would become hugely valuable to the health community if this story is true. I know there are going to be plenty of doubters, as usual, who'll claim Apple is committing fraud or something. Anyway, I can't wait to hear more details about this Glucose Monitoring AppleWatch."
You don’t trade Apple. Hold. This will be taking off eventually and you won’t want to miss it. Beet quarter ever abs we drop...yah...ok.
The call options from $140 - $155 have a 10-1 ratio to puts for this week. I wonder what will happen on Thursday?
Timmy needs to increase the pitiful dividend to at least 2%.
"I dumped this a while back. Even when they knock it out of the park, their stock drops. I just don't get it. I'll get back in after it drops some more."
"Apple's services business was in fine form last fiscal year, recording 16% growth over the prior year. It produced nearly 20% of Apple's total revenue. The new service Apple One: a smart move made by the iPhone maker to bundle various services under one umbrella. For more hot stocks like (AAPL) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
"This will go down another 5 dollars in after hours or may just stop. I think Apple stock is going to be made an example and it may go to $50 or less Wall Street doesn't care about earning, thats a thing of the past. Quick money is the game now look at the other garbage stock GME , AMCetc.. I'm losing $1000's now but not sure if I'm holding much longer. This could be a disaster of a lifetime, and it's very possible."
"Wow, what a quarter. Up or down tomorrow Apple is a company to own."
Stop the hedge fund hegemony! Buy Apple Hold Apple Profit from Apple 
Shorts better be careful!
Apple always a winner. Just buy and sell it in 30 yrs!
"Stock still trades for 30 times earnings expected in 2021 of 5.14. The stock traded at 15 times earnings from 2015 to 2017. Yes it has great growth during the pandemic and 5g cycle, but it will fade."
Typical market....a months worth of gains go bye bye in 48 hours.
It was in the news last month that $MSFT will design their own chips. I hope they will go to $TSM for fabrication like what $AAPL did. It is win win situation.
"With a good ER report, $ 160 at the end of the week. Guarantee !"
FYI if you listened to the shorts you will keep loosing money. LONG AAPL
"Still holding on to a 1/29 130 call, should I hold STILL? I don’t want to be caught in the after ER sell off, but the upside is definitely there."
"My estimates for APPLE - Revenue 105 B - 115 B, Earning 1.50 -1.60 and strong guidance for iphones, macs, wearables, and services."
will pick more up after $AAPL earning calls
"Call isn’t until 5 pm!! Cam down, we are all gonna be rich!"
"FB, MSFT,APPL all had earning beat, APPL has the best ER of all, FB , MSFT are up while APPL is down , I don't get it."
OMG this is gonna b me tonight and at work tomorow
Get to $145 already. You know you want to...
. Apple pre-split. . 560’s.
lets get together and do a GME with APPL.
Wasting time with this so called “great buy”!!!
"It's pretty simple. Buy and hold this best brand in the world, sit back and relax! Don't let the market ups & downs bother you unnecessarily. If you want quick profits, go and risk it all with GME, AMC and etc.Tim Cook reminded the world last night (once again) that even with the blow out quarter, there's so much market share that AAPL can tap into in addition to new products in the works. Just look at AAPL's stock chart for the last 5-10 years. Don't listen to all these short term naysayers that are just trying to #$%$ out so that they can make a quick buck. They probably accessed this board on their Apple device. :-)"
"Think long term, not short term when it comes to Apple."
This will be green tomorrow no doubt. Lord knows why it’s showing dash 3%
"In all honesty, like Tesla, post earnings, all the money printing, low interest rates, this thing could run beyond what we are expecting! $200 sooner than we expect!"
"This company is going to $200. Buy now and get in cheap. Soon all of the GME money will be pouring into AAPL, as it is the best investment you can make in the entire stock market."
I’m buying and hold! I love apple 
I agree. Buy after hours and accumulate is the key. Smart money will gap up above 150..you will see
Apple is the best stock ever. I’ve made over 425% in 5 years. I retired early because I own it. I won’t sell any until I have to for tax reasons.
When can aapl start loading up again with buybacks ?
150 tomorrow who agrees
" announced they are taking over the stock market. They will let you know when you can sell your shares and for how much. If you don't like it, you can tweet about it. They are releasing scripted tweets you are allowed to use at your discretion. Any variation of the tweet will cause your account to be suspended. Lastly, they are also releasing information on approved hair styles. The only one approved for men, is called the Bezos. It's the shaved head sleepy eye look. This concludes the morning service announcement."
Apparently it doesn’t matter that Canoo DECLINED the buyout off from $AAPL. Speculators are going to pump this no matter what 
Buy now. Will only go up now. Profit takers are gone
Needham $170 share upgrade this morning.
$140 tomorrow
This is #$%$. Excellent earnings and stock down and wall street croonies say they don't manipulate market. Come on now.
We can realistically see 150 tomorrow
My savings account hates me this week although my portfolio will thank me in a months time
TSLA and AAPL partnership?? Both companies did a stock split offering back last year and now announcing ER same day...I think something is brewing between the 2
BUY THE DIP went down because of sell the news which always happens with apple and hedge funds liquidating their top stock to pay their failed shorts
"For those that are new to Apple, it always drops after earnings if it has a run up before it. Doesn't matter if it is good earnings or NASDAQ is up 5%. Apple is not a trading stock, its kind of like an old IBM stock. Stable so it doesn't move much, depressing sometimes but it will deliver. I consider it as my ""bonds"" position since I don't have invest in real bonds. Buy EVs if you want action and if you want more action, try reddit stocks, haha."
"When someone tells me AAPL and AMZN are going to do very well in 2021 I simply respond with a resounding DUH! Both these companies provide exactly what consumers want, when they want it and how they want it. Facebook and Netflix could both disappear overnight and no one would care because there are too many alternatives. Apple will blow away earnings as they build an ever-larger user base along with a bevy of innovative products. Happy New Year!"
This is going up !! They made 1.8B in sales in holidays just from APP STORE!!
"Who believes AAPL best 4-years are to come? Vote thumbs up! If you believe AAPL best 4-years have just passed, vote thumbs down!"
"Just talked to Mr Sidwell at Goldman Sachs. He said they have put huge buy orders for AAPL in the morning from the money they made at AMC. This is how they make their portfolio less volatile. Also, he said that there are no signs of a correction this is just a regular day at the end of Jan. They are re-investing their profits from AMC into Apple and Starbucks in the % ratio of 70 and 30 each. So, congratulations to those who held on today."
"So I have decided that since apple wants to decide who their customers are, I am going to decide who I want to invest my money with. What phone I will buy for myself and my family, What kind of laptop and desktop computer to buy. Apple should stay in their lane and if they don't I would suggest not investing with them someone else can buy my shares on monday"
Looks like a tough pill for the AAPL old timers to swallow but at some point you have to let go. Now is the time. The historical all-time top has been put in but you won't know that for a couple of months. It's been a nice run and you should be happy.
"Slowly but surely AAPL is showing a comeback, hopefully  by market closing."
"Like many stocks APPL beats on all financial measures and falls the next day. Here's why: There is no such thing as free money by figuring out the stock market. The algorithms know this and the AI understands human thought and reason,,,,,,,so Amateur investors took a position in APPLE ""knowing"" they were going to beat the earnings estimates. The stock would pop and they could cash in. So........the computers simply said let's take it down, they are amateurs and will sell at a loss. That's how the game works. Not just with Apple but many other stocks."
if they disappoint even in the slightest this will drop to 130 easy or less then the entire market will go into a correction down 10%. apple will drop 30% in a correction down to 105-110 before it climbs back out. if they beat and give guidance which I doubt they will do it will be 148-150.
Apple at $2166.84T it will easily add $350 billion in new market cap after ER.
"All I can say is this: Bought Apple for the first time last August, right before the split. After today’s drop I am up 25.31%. Nothing bad about that.....Apple is solid!"
"I haven't been interested in Apple for a long time because I dislike the changes that have been made over the years. I've been a Mac user since the early 80s, and I think they have become the anti-thesis of their original mission. However, I am pleased they took a stand to protect our country from insurrection. I won't get into political battles here. I just want to say that I think Apple made the best move for the nation, and I am buying contrary to this backlash because I believe the price will rise."
Short term thinking does you no favors with Apple. 30 day chart? Who cares?Take the long view.
This is normal price action leading up to earnings. Plus the price bumps help. It may pull back a little on Tuesday and Wednesday then pop 5% on earnings beat. If there are any misses it will drop 10%
"Sell now. You can buy back your shares around $111 next week, if you still want to hold this bubble."
They are piling into Apple today! about time. Big quarter coming
"Sold all of my AAPL and bought GME and AMC.Essentially fundamentals and technical analysis mean nothing now. And zombie companies like GameStop, AMC can be propped up by rouge investment groups with little of no value. Hedge funds who are covering need to sell their winners like Apple Inc. So, until this trend changes–I'm placing my bets on today's action."
"Whoever sold at $103, $110, $120 or the last 2days, will buying back at a higher price! remember this happens all the time. LOL!"
"Bought a boatload of Apple in 2005. With all the splits that would have made it under $2. We BOTH retired early 50s because of this move. . Still our biggest holding for growth. We do all of our own trading as a money manager made us zip after a number of years. Moral of story....Buy Apple...you’ll never time it properly....just buy. That’s ok. Own Apple. Buy the dips. Don’t trade, Apple and you will be rewarded. "
"Did you all get your $2,000 yet from Byedung? Of course not. It's more of a priority to change the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman's image. I'm not denigrating Harriet Tubman, but what type of priorities does Byedung have?"
Lots of upgrades today
"All markets are going down. Apple as well but only less than 1%. When the whole market is going up again, apple is going higher than other"
I bought a Nokia phone and it works fine.
Much ado about nothing!

"Hyundai confirms early stage talks with Apple on EV, FT reportsHyundai Motor (HYMTF) has confirmed early stage talks with Apple (AAPL) about building an electric vehicle, The Financial Times' Song Jung-a, Edward White and Patrick McGee report. ""Apple and Hyundai are in discussions, but as it is at an early stage, nothing has been decided,"" Hyundai told the publication, adding that Apple is speaking with ""a variety of global carmakers."" Reports swirled on Thursday that Apple plans to launch its electric vehicle in 2027 and is teaming up with Hyundai to develop the car and its own EV batteries."
"I think to my knowledge buying back share would be better then dividend, beacuse the less share the higher stock price. Although i like the dividend, but rather buying back share bc we have 17 billion plus share. Any honest thought would be Appreciated."
This will continue until AAPL is allowed to buyback after the SEC blackout due to earnings
"One of these days the tide will change and Tesla will go flat for a while, then Apple will move $20 in a couple of weeks. They are both long term buys!"
"I thought this was a board for Apple, not the NFL board? I love football and watching the game now but come on now!"
Name 1 thing he accomplished in 45 years of public service. 1 thing
"Bought 200 shares last Tuesday at $127.50. Sold today for $143.15. Not a bad profit for 6 days. I might be leaving money on the table, but such is life."

"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported better-than-expected fiscal-year first quarter results, aided by strong iPhone momentum, especially in China.The Apple Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty maintained an Overweight rating on Apple and increased the price target from $152 to $164.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating and $175 price target.Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated an Outperform rating and increased the price target from $150 to $160.Needham analyst Laura Martin maintained a Buy rating and hiked the price target from $140 to $170.Why Apple Could Be Set For Double-Digit Growth: The combination of larger installed base, fully refreshed product portfolio and continued working and learning from home trends suggest Apple is on track to report strong double-digit growth over the next several quarters, Morgan Stanley's Huberty said in a note.The iPhone's strength, especially in China, and across-the-board Services upside contributed most of the beat, and gross margin expanded about two points, the analyst said.Although Apple did not provide formal revenue guidance, it said it expects normal seasonal trends, suggesting revenue of about $76 billion to $78 billion, she said.This is about $3 billion ahead of the consensus, Huberty said.The active device installed base growth accelerated from 7% a year ago to 10% and services monetization grew at the fastest rate in several years, the analyst said.Customer loyalty remains well north of 90% across Apple products, she said.Morgan Stanley now estimates 2020-2025 revenue CAGR of 10%, thanks to accelerating installed base growth, improved services monetization and a recovery in China. Higher gross margins are sustainable given growing FX tailwinds and a continued mix uplift across products, Huberty said.""Net, we raise our forward revenue and margin estimates with FY21 EPS increasing 6% to $4.47 and FY22 EPS increasing 8% to $4.61, both materially above consensus.""Buybuybuy "
Surprised people are still holding this stock $TWTR $FB $AMZN $AAPL at this time and at these prices.
Some arguments here -It’s a cyber security company and market cap is so low compared to others. It has an intelligent vehicle platform which it plans to enhance using AWS. Then why is the revenue going down sequentially compared to OKTA and CRWD which have astronomical growth. Something is not adding up. The CFO also dumped all his shares.I am long but I have my doubts.
the buyers will come in at a record. no one wants to sell here as the stock will move up big time
Earnings coming up with iPhone 12 Holliday sales....buy and hold
Headlines: “Tim Cook sounds slightly sheepish about how well Apple did in 2020”
Take it as a gift that it hasn’t run up off the back of that massive ER. I’m adding tomorrow and been in the stock for a long time. 
We could very well hit new highs before ER
its time for 160
"Apple's returns past 4 years:2 year return: 244%3 year return: 188%5 year return: %407%Every year we hear the same story. Apple is a dinosaur stock that's overpriced and won't move up much more. Yet every year, Apple proves the doubters wrong. Apple is in the midst of a super cycle. It will enter the EV market within the next few years and has yet to unveil its AI products. Its new M1 chip is said to be revolutionary and leaves its competitors in the dust. Its EV battery which its been working on since 2015 will be a major disruptor in the industry that Tesla will not even be able to compete with.With Apple, I've learned that you have to stay patient and stay long. Never mind the short term chatter. You will be handsomely rewarded for your patience."
Heading to 150 today let’s go 
Up $4.00 pre market....glad you sold last week?
this is normal price action for apple holders. newbies are being taught a lesson. apple is the most widely held stock and is manipulated in both directions. it always gives you an entry point on sell offs like this. typically 10-20% discounts just buy it on every dip and hold it. in a bad market correction of 10-15 % apple will drop 30% just the way it is. buy the dips and never sell it unless you are a trader.
This is now $160 on Wednesday 
VIX down quite big and VXN unchanged a sure indicator that the market will rebound sharply today
My point?Read my earlier posts
"Between tomorrow and Friday the Dow will be up 3000 points and guess what the Nasdaq and S&P will do even better percentage wise. Beware shorts beware because you will get squeezed like a squash and the margin calls will come pouring in like a torrential rain and lightning. Please kindly remember I warned you. Each and every human being looks for stability and so does the country. Even animals looks for stability. Case in point ! My new puppy began to hide treats under the table , under the sofa etc. He had to be persuaded that there is no need to hide the treats because the treats are “stability flowing “. Once he got the message he quit hiding things. We humans are like that too. We need conclusive stability to get going with our business"
"Apple’s iPhone fourth quarter sales in China hit 18 million units according to DigiTimes. The momentum is expected to continue and get a boost through (February 11th to February 26th) the Lunar New Year Holiday. According to China’s Ministry of Commerce, Chinese consumers in 2019 spent $149 billion across the week-long Chinese New Year holiday. Yes Virginia, there is a “Super Cycle.”"
Looks alot like the AAPL chart pattern of February to July 2015….tomorrow will confirm or not
To predictable if skyrockets after more blowout quarters!!! Flippin relax
$150 next week
Was there a reason why everything tumbled from 10:30 to 11:10??
I own stock in one of the biggest most profitable companies in the world. Not worried.
!!!!LATEST NEWS: JOE BIDON SAID HE WANTS TO LET BIG TECH PAY MORE TAXES!!!!!
Huge beat!
Does anyone else think the GameStop short squeeze is going to crash the market?
AAPL annual meeting is 2-23-21. As a share holder you have the right to vote in an election that might affect your investment. If you are a shareholder don't miss your chance to make your choice. As an example Al Gore is up for reelection to AAPL board
Government may be taking some step to curb shorting stocks after the episode covering few days with one stock and the hedge funds involved. My advise to the shorts cover all your short positions today . According to Fox some Hedge Funds ran out of money and had to borrow from other hedge funds to cover their short positions. I would hate to live do dangerously and for what?
If I didn’t promise myself not to buy any more Aapl stock because I am overweight in it in my portfolio I would buy it at this price. Unfortunately I need to to focus on other stocks right now. AAPL won’t stay low. Even if there is another bear market people should still dollar cost average and AAPL always recovers fast. One of the most stable tech stock besides MSFT.
thanks for the cheap shares
$140 tomorrow and $150 after earnings...apple and Facebook strong
I hate shorts. they should outlaw shorting a stock or at least implement the uptick rule again. this would prevent them from shorting the stock on the way down... only on the way up. %$^## the shorts. buy and hold own it dont trade it. buy every dip and reinvest your divi people. apple always makes money regardless of the shorts trying to scare you out of your shares.
Me too I am buying more at the opening. 150 is the fresh start. Anything under is xmas gift and discounted. I hear 200 in Feb-March
Bankrupt companies manipulated up to all time highs. Companies with incredible quarterly earnings manipulated down. What a time.
The little battle between AAPL and FB is hurting both companies
THEY’RE TRYING SO HARD BUT AAPL WILL BE +5% TMRW! HOLD!Copy and paste this comment so everyone knows the truth.
Why is it plummeting?
this is typical action for apple right before earnings... it runs up then pulls back a little bit the day before and the day of earnings. we need to have a little room for it to run post earnings report... so it probably will pull back to 138 or 140 around the previous high then after earnings run up to 145-150 depending on a beat.... if it disappoints then it pulls back to 128
Bought 30 contracts calls 130 Feb 19th expiration. hoping for great earnings and guidance.
This stock is the foundation of my portfolio. It's the one stock I never worry about. Have plenty of great runners but when they burn out those profits go into AAPL.
"Let me clarify the statement ""The field is in the hands of investors""Over the past month, many were playing mini dips and doing very well with that algorithim play: 50 to 100% a day.Since trading has been suspended the algorithim play from Tuesday close to Friday close returned anywhere from 100o+% and higher in four days. AAPL Jan 22 $130 calls ran from .65 Tuesday at 1559 hrs to $10+ iintra day high closing at $9.05.Anyone reading these boards who played options should have had this play. I hope so.Let me explain this statement. WE, this community, agreed to no dips and letting AAPL run until after earnings. No, this is not a ""Ponzi scheme"" as someone posted.Where ever AAPL settles it could be $5, $10 or $15 higher from here, AAPL will be AAPL, trading in mini ""v's.It may never see this level again. Earnings play?Be here n 1/27...my lucky number 1027 was my police badge number until ...!"
Congrats to the Longs!
"Anybody crying apple is dead right now, you do realise the entire market is an absolute bloodbath right now right? And that we are still green in said bloodbath"
netflix up $60...wooooooow and apple up 0.50 cents wow w ow oww wow wowmwow woww
I read that analysts were disappointed with Apple's Q1 forecast? Like 95 cents for Q1 2021 vs 67 cents Q1 2020. That is still a 45% increase for next Q. Apple is rocking! Apple P/E will be down to about 27.
We need see at least $145

Is there a phone alternative that does not have operating software owned by Apple and Google? I want nothing to do with these companies.

"$AAPL Historical P/E=12AAPL Current P/E=45, but the revenues and earnings are going down and there is NO growth opportunity left. AAPL is a MASSIVE Speculative BUBBLE right now! The stock is trading as PONZI SCHEME!"
BUY time for me. LOADING UP 2500+ prior to ER.... #BOOM #BULLRUN $AAPL
Any one knows tomorrow at which time apple will announce its report?
"That was a delicious dip. Keep panic selling newbies, I want desert."
Man id love to scoop up some more shares of APPL but it literally never seems to drop lol !
Acting like a bad apple but in realty it is a red delicious healthy apple.
"BLEW past even the highest projections. Annihilated the numbers. Do not sell, just buy more. An absolute must own stock for every investor"
Unbelievable earning result! Great job Apple! We will see this stock flying again soon.
It would be really awesome if the Reddit crowd jumped on the Apple shorts and bid it up since it is the most widely owned company in the market. If they wanted to teach Wall Street crooks a real lesson they would attack a stock like Apple. That would really benefit the retail investor.
Market cap is 2.2 trillion dollars . This is down 5 today. Where is your math? No wonder the Reddit are taking $$ from the hedge funds market. It’s finally some justice. Too bad l am victim of the finance war.
"Hi everyone, one here aside from Apple.HALL (NASDAQ) Hallmark Financial Services. Insurance services. Stock is at 3.53 and looks fairly undervalued. Book value at 9 dollars. Exited an unprofitable line and looks like plenty of upside. Current market cap is around 60m and Total investments, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $645.3 million or $35.57 per share. Credit rating re affirmed a few days ago.Thoughts?"
"It’s a beat top and bottom. +15 points tomorrow and trapped shorts. Moon, 177.00."
All good. Up tomorrow. If for whatever reason it is not then buy the dip.
AAPL will gap-up huge on Monday Trust me. hedge fund will fight to cover who cover 1st. Buy buy I told tis morning...GAME IS OVER..they are covering
last chance to buy ... today will be 150
"Buy apple, hold apple, profit from apple Squeeze the shorts out of this quality business "
We're in a bear market that started Monday January 25th 2021
Here’s the thing with AAPL that I learned the hard way. It’s not a pump and dump. It’s not for millennials with 3 second attention spans. It’s like a great Cabernet. It’s gets better and it’s notes appreciate over time ... literally. So this stock you buy and you put it on the rack and let it collect dust. Then you slowly screw out the cork in about ten years and reap its bounty from your mere patience. It’s that simple.
"In a free country, one doesn’t have to worry about what one says. That’s not the case here, anymore."
"Hold your position and buy more after hours. Shorties will start to cry eventually. Keep in mind that AAPL solid profit Q over Q , Fiscal year over FY is your core, your backbone of calmness and confidence. Apple rocks! in product and service. Trust in fundamentals more than bashers, institutions who want to take risk with no basis just. A monster gap-up is coming to AAPL , just buy more. AAPL has my blessings and all shorties will run away to the hill to cover. Patience . Shorties will cry eventually."
"Totally dumbfounded today! Dow and Nas soaring .... FB, MSFT, NVDA up big! AAPL posts record earnings, upward revised price targets and it can't go green! Total insanity !"
Take a look at Netflix. That's Apple after their blowout earnings report.
buying 3300 more shares.
"Wait for earnings call, that will make it move."
"Disgraceful what Apple, Amazon, Facebook, google, and Twitter are doing. Seems Parler snatched a few million of Facebook's customers (including me) so now they must shut them down? Hard to fight back, but every little bit helps. I cancelled my Amazon account (don't like them anyway), don't shop at Whole Foods, don't read the Washington Post (Bozo's mouth piece), canceled my Facebook account (no ad revenue from me), canceled my Apple music subscription (can use Spotify), and will be changing to Reagan Mail. Like I said, not much impact from one person, but if millions do it, they will feel it. They only understand $$$$. I'm a long time Apple shareholder and not happy with them right now at all."

"Earnings Whispers says, ""Apple (AAPL) reported 1st Quarter December 2020 earnings of $1.68 per share on revenue of $111.4 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.41 per share on revenue of $102.6 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.52 per share. Revenue grew 21.4% on a year-over-year basis."" SO WHY SELL??????????????????????????????????"

SELL THE NEWS.....MARKET GONNA CONTINUE IT'S SELL OFF TOMORROWTHE CORRECTION IS DUE ... BE CAREFUL
every push above 135 is met with relentless selling pressure to keep it under 135.... guess we close right around 135 or so.

"guys were in the middle of a market correction an retailers/short sellers at war with each other, what do you expect, give things a chance appl not going anywhere with 2.3 trillion market cap trust me"
Stay Long
"The selloff is manipulated, guys. Hold it and buy the dip!"
I actually like the fact that AAPL is taking a breather today. I’d be okay if it took a breather during trading hours tomorrow too. Then it’s not coming into ER as hot.
i told you it will be a sell of after the last financial results!!! lets hope the price will stop at 130-132
Should’ve bought GameStop - dang it
"AAPl's nature is ""V""s with new highs.The pivot varies depending on many factorsAs posted early this am, anyone needking cash use the Da Vinci Strategy.Anyone who wants to buy more...wait! If this continues we will use the Van Gough Strategy"
"EPS: $1.68 vs $1.41 expected, according to Refinitiv consensus estimatesRevenue: $111.44 billion vs $103.28 billion expected, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates"
Wow what if apple makes chips and software for EV. Every other EV will have software and chips from another company. Apple could do it all. Throw in apple battery tech and things may look very profitable.
Wedbush raises price target to $175.
VZ report is not a telltale sign of the productivity of AAPL. 80% of new phone sales are upgrades which speaks of loyalty. What you can’t factor is China sales which have skyrocketed along with rest of world with iPhone 12. Price goes up from here post ER
"just hold on it, don't believe on short-term, play long term and gain much more up for me 27% Keep it till end % it will double your money soon. long term,"
ummm?
"AAPL should boost dividends more than normal. Also, did you see TSNP? It’s a PayPal juggernaut in the making and 35 cents. I hate OTC stocks but it’s the only one I invested in the past 5 years"
Shorters left wirh anxious person let's go upIf you dont Trust Apple just Look at other Stock having there Results today
Apple reported great numbers but unfortunately the market rewards poor performance these days. Look at AAL.
Earning probably baked in. Shorties hoping you sell so they can make money off you. Hold tight
last chance to buy in the dip. never ever again under 131.
RUMP WALKED BY THE COMPANY AND THE STOCK SOLD OFF

"Wow! I consider myself a cautious investor, but sometimes it boggles my mind, but then I understand there are outside forces knocking our beautiful apple stock down after a magnificent earnings report. So to all those out there hang on it may be bumpy because of the Dow’s other components that are negative and affecting our stock. Good days are coming."
AAPL Performance snapshots:Last 6 months: $ 95.00 to $137.09 (44.3 %)Last 3 months: $111.00 to $137.09 (23.5 %)Last 1 month: $135.98 to $137.09 (0.82 %)Last 5 days: $137.14 to $137.09 (-0.04%)Last 1 day: $139.52 to $137.09 (-1.74 %)Reasonable earnings during previous pandemic impacted quarters.Blowout performance this quarter…. AAPL deserves better !!
Another cash flow option trick rather than buy now?Sell a Jan 22 put for $20+ a share. But WE will wait if this nonsense continues.The trick is to always take what the markets offer. Never try to muscle stocks
America has the best and most solid numbers when it comes to pandemic and COVID-19. We always win!

LOL after-hours...fear sets in ...the report isn't even out....
AAPLE always does better 3 days after earnings!
I expect close to 100 billions in sales watch the move
I voted for BYDON loving it
Big tech is the target and apple is at the top of the list.
The same thing happening to Microsoft today will happen to apple tmrw. HOLD
"It was posted on Tuesday how AAPL could rally but the calls and puts could fall in value.Print out last nights closing prices then prices at open, 1100 hrs and close"
Any thoughts on aapl today? Da Vinci?
Ladies and Gentlemen this action is not about AAPl fundamentals but option action.It is a chess game.Everyone was cautioned this may have happened. Go back and read Tuesday's posts.Good Luck
I hope all hedge funds burn for what they have done to apple since earnings ! Predators!
Cowen reiterated Outperform rating but raise price target from 133 to 153
"Market manipulation at its finest by RH, hedgefunds, institutions against retail investors... I am not letting GO of AAPL ... FOR LIFE>"
told you we would test the 130 range for the 10% pullback from the 145 high. we have now officially entered a correction of the stock price.
BUY THE DIP THE DOW WILL GO TO 35.000
"Almost 20% higher er than analysts consensus, great job apple "
Thinking of making my next desktop computer an Apple branded one. Anyone have one and make recommendations either for or against?My main usage would be to create gaming projects using the Unreal Engine.
"Retail traders, DO NOT SELL after hours. Apple has shown to rise and Clío after hours but then rise further the next day. AAPL is the market. This is America!"
BACK TO $140...ON THE WAY TO $150 TODAY!! WAIT AND SEE!!! :))
Hope longs held their positions today. Look ahead to end of this year and into 2022. Apple  will be good.
"I’m so happy to see the fight between $AAPL and $FB. I hope they run each other into the ground. BTW, when is Tim going to delete the Facebook app from the App Store? Or is he all talk?"
pull forward... this cant replicate it sorry but dont believe it people dont upgrade overpriced gadgets every year
This is exciting!
Upgrades coming.
I predicted 135 Friday 145 by Wednesday then earnings push another 15-20 looking at 160-170
If you are not in this stock prior to blowout earnings in a week just stop doing stock market stuff.
My take: they'll park this at 137.50 tomorrow to kill all the options. You're dreaming if you think this is going to gap up to 150.......like I said...it's about killing the options contracts for 137.50 / 140 / 142.50. Tomorrow is end of the month...triple witching hour in the Options world.

"Hardware/Services with new products being added regularly.Stock is flat lined, very strange"
"Haaaaa. Wait until Tim Cook starts talking about 4th quarter sales , then guidance. You haven’t seen nothing yet!"
Will be some profit taking now leading up to earnings...don’t blow a gasket when you see it...be calm
AppleMarket cap is too big iPad and Mac sales to decrease during the great reopening Valuation PE is too high especially if interest rates begin to riseApple is not a great reopening trade
buy and hold
Prediction... Not only will Apple car be the coolest car ever with a brand new battery tech that far outpaces Tesla... I bet Apple also is very competitive in its pricing of the car too!
You shouldn't be scared for a companies that are making profits YOY like $aapl and don't get panicked of this drops in price. It will be back with bang.

Remember that Apple is just 3 months into a 2 year SuperCycle. $200 is not out of the question in 2021.
$120 billion qtr
Pump and dump reverse-psychology. No fundamentals involved. Trade on speculation and fake news. But we all know Apple is solid.
I am not even worried about Apple. Because I accumulated a lot of shares through splits that even in a down day I do not care. I am still up regardless!
"I’m not seeing this on CNBC, but considering the 144 recent high, Apple is now trading in the 10% correction territory immediately following their best quarter everywhere.Massive buying coming soon."
"Average in a little at a time at these AAPL sale prices, that is what I am doing."
Hey guys I’m a fairly new investor and I’m wonder why with a great earnings report is the stock going down?
"Too good to be true, just bought more shares..."
Scared money don’t make money!
"Apple is a cash machine! You Don’t trade Apple. You invest in it! It will go up. Stay long & strong. $111.4 in rev. India the next China, Icar, Apple ev car breakthrough battery. All positive! Don’t miss out on these. Buy and hold!"
$103 Billion earnings report expectation tomorrow  show me the green  baby!
Go whine somewhere else Kevin. This is an Apple stock forum!!
WE posted weeks ago that Sales will be strong
This is why you need to capitalize on 300 point Dow gains...because tomorrow it looks like a 300 point loss. I expect under $135 tomorrow. So annoyed about earnings action and the reason I can’t stand earnings days. Tech always gets trounced.
"I have said this hundreds of times, this is not a stock you trade. The pattern of some selling after great earning is predictable, but if you are a new investor this is the time to load the boat for the future. Who sell's a stock that just made around $112 billion in a quarter and is in a 5G super cycle? If you do sell it, where do you put your money? This stock will run to $170 by the Spring and I believe be approximately $200 by the end of the year."
Better hope this exceeds ER on Wednesday. Analyst hype is driving up the price and any hint of weakness will crush it.
"Relax longs, we're heading for Green Numbers tomorrow and going forward. DON'T SELL !!"
Markets aren’t manipulated and corrupt? HAHA
Huwawei sell much less smartphones. That is good news for Apple.
"You elected him and now you’re going to pay the consequences. Inflation, job loss, rising interest rates, declining property values and a major market correction. Congratulations"
"Money, money, money, money, money!"
"We will be green before close, so predictable; tomorrow and beyond upwards. $200 is so realistic short term."
"Jan 26 (Reuters) -* Apple ramps up iphone and ipad output shift to India and VietnamNikkei* Apple Ipad production will begin in Vietnam as early as the middle of this year. Apple is also increasing production capacity for smart speakers, earphones and computers in Southeast Asia as part of its ongoing diversification strategy, the sources added.In Vietnam, Apple is mobilizing suppliers to expand production capacity for the latest HomePod mini, the affordable version of its voice-activated smart speaker lineup. The device has been produced in Vietnam since it was introduced last year. The Cupertino-based tech giant has already increased local production of its audio-related products, including its various AirPods lineups, sources said."
Why.?... why?... I can’t find any single reason that Apple goes down today. I’m sticking to that.
I’m not so sure about this:“JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee says Apple will ‘go big or go home’ with its electric car.The analyst says that the car will be completely autonomous and be built by Apple itself.”
"My realistic outlook on Apple heading into earnings week. I think it will go up, but not as high as some claim. Yes this is the first earnings report since iPhone launch, as well as the launch of the new iMacs, watches, iPads and all the accessories for those products. Now a big part of revenue that plays a factor here is the stores, which have not been open for quite some time. They’ve simply relied on their own website. Partnered companies such as bestbuy and the cellular companies. I don’t think $175-$200 per share will happen, I expect similar progress as Netflix, a 16% increase which puts at $150-ish especially when taking in these factors. $100 billion report come Wednesday is no impossible but I think it’s a overreaction. I think it will be close though!"
I think Netflix set the tone of the market for at least one year if not years to come. Excellent results from Netflix. And there is a vast expansion of the application and use of technology including and specially the semiconductor sector of which we cannot even dream of let alone think. Cars are now not only mechanical but also electronic. Since I am ancient and old I never thought I will see this age of technology. My advise stay fully invested forever and watch your investments grow through leap and bounds.
"They can have biggest blowout in earnings, but it the future where 70M are going to haunt Apple everywhere they go. I see it the office with people telling others it is CCP phone and drawing lines on them having the phone."
VIX and VXN both unchanged. A great  indicator the markets will rise sharply today
Tomorrow.
This stock is the gift that keeps on giving
Sleepy Joe policies really setting the market on fire!
Today’s action is just a mating dance in lieu of the ER report. Then the real action begins. Hehe. Fly Apple Fly 
Apple VR
Apple reported great numbers. Not sure why Apple in the after-hours market is down slightly.I guess people would rather pay $900 for Tesla and $389 for GME.Things will be fine and Apple will move up tomorrow.
"There is no better long term investment plan than buy as much AAPL as you can, as soon as you can, and hold. This goes up over time. In no time, people will be saying, man, I wish I had bought Apple at $140. It's a no brainer!"
"A korean company, LG innotek, that supplies camera module to Iphone just posted a HUGE earning surprise. If you know what that means"
Apple is doing the right thing against FAKEBOOK so I bought on the drop today. Boolean
"Apple, own it don’t trade it."
It’s fun to see the shorts triggered when reality sets in.
"FOR SALE: I'm selling my white privilege card. It's over 70 years old but is in mint condition. It has never been used, not even one time. Reason for selling is that it hasn't done a damn thing for me! No free college, no free food, no free housing, no free anything, I actually had to go to work every day of my life while paying a boatload of taxes to carry those who chose not to work! If you are interested, I prefer cash but would be willing to do an even trade for a Race Card which seems much more widely accepted and comes with countless benefits if you fit the profile! Interested? Contact me on my Non-Obama cell phone that I pay for every month…"
I feel happy when the market manipulators/funds lose money....just praying Apple shocks the market with upside earnings....like BOOM
I guess this is how the markets work now
I BUY EACH TIME APPLE DROPS HAD APPL OVER 30 YEARS.

$msft is lifting apple boat
Blowout earnings on the way. Git'er done!
msft and aapl. I think these are the two best companies to own for the future. They're into everything and have great management.
Great results...$150 soon
"So this is starting to look like punishment from the hedge fund jack a’s to hit millennial stock, and the market in general, to make everyone pay for their losses. Joe owns this."
"Rod Hall at GS has been an apple super ear for at least 5-6 years now. He has cost his clients or any one who listens to him a fortune. Short Margin interest alone must have devastated so many,"
"I am a New trader , bought aapl at 144. Should I sell when it’s up and get back in when it gets low? Or just hold them and buy more when it dips? Sounds like a great company to hold long term? Appreciate your guidance"
I see apple to hit 3 trillion market cap soon may be in the summer.
"Hopefully we don’t get a broad market sell off before earnings. It looked like it this morning, then turned around. A lot of investors are spooked right now."
Who else bought more on that big drop after hours
100 billion dollars in revenue. $150 too ez this week.
"buy now. Hedgies are covering . Expect Moday huge pop. 145 or maybe 150 fresh start...load up now, Use margin if possible. Let's squeeze out all shorties"
It will turn green AH
A lose retailer that sells videos games and hardly makes any profit now has a valuation of $24 Billion. ROFL!
"Look for the Apple car to retail for 75,000.00 in 2024."
HOLD IT guys!! Don't let them squeeze you! They just want your shares and your money! Stay away shorties!!!!!

This is what happens....when Apple is struggling we see a lot of bashers...like a lot of them...we don’t go way.. we vent out.. but we still stick...how about these bashers? Where are they today?? Haha
"Today is a Chess game.Noting more; nothing less.After open, if and only if the right moves are made, everyone can do very well.What are those moves?Think about it"
"Why would anyone even consider selling apple? I mean really, where do you think it will be in a month or two- or next year? There’s no safer play in the market as far as I’m concerned."
2 substantial share price increases and zero response.If it was TSLA it would be up 10-15 %
This is complete and utter horse$hit. Where’s the $160 everybody was screaming a week ago?
hmm... thought about putting some money into apple because I saw so many of my friends making money in tech... Everyone telling me not to get fomo now.. so I guess I'll wait for this to drop big.. seems like something big is going to happen in tech..
Biden says will send out $1400 more dollars per person. Trump tax cuts resulted in middle class keeping average of $3000. Biden ending those tax cuts. Biden’s new plan will increase minimum wage to $15 just when small businesses trying to open and save themselves. Biden’s plan will increase tax on many small businesses. All this will result in less hiring and unemployment. Biden’s plan will increase tax on your stock profits. Sounds like great plan to further destroy the economy.

"American Airlines loses billions and surges 64% PM and here’s Apple in the red.....rigged market Apple earned $1.68 per share for its latest quarter, versus a consensus estimate of $1.41 a share. Revenue came in well above estimates and surpassed $100 billion for the first time. Apple’s quarter was its most profitable ever, helped by sales of new high-end iPhones as well as laptops and tablets. Apple shares slipped 2% in premarket trading."
$140 next week. $185 after earnings.
This will be down big tomorrow. Shaking all the weak hands out..
"My Tesla shares decided to sleep in today and was down 0.7%. But that's alright, because my Apple & Amazon stock are now awake from their hibernation and are shouldering the burden for my portfolio; it was up $18.5K today thanks to AAPL & AMZN."
I don't believe there has a green day for the market when Apple reports for at least 4 quarters
150 on earnings
Going higher ! Get on the rocket! $160 by March !
Apple will closed at$133.00 today because strong volume with o/I price range $131-$133.00.

YOO guys! if i want to open a position in APPL should i wait for a dip or buy right now.. its for long term
Back up the truck and load up the shares. Apple is happy to buy back their own shares. A year from now prices will be higher. Shareholder since 2011. Trust the process. Apple is printing money every seconds .
Months and months of gains go whoosh in 48 hours.

Apple expected to post its ever first-quarter with more than $100 Billion revenue Wednesday!!!!WAY TO GO APPLE!!!!
"Aftermarket is for amateurs. Apple killed earnings. Tomorrow apple flys 150+. All these shorts are gonna be toast tomorrow. My guess today was a concerted effort by the big houses to broad base sell to trigger stop limits of the little guys for fing with them cause of GME, amc, bb, bbyd. Tomorrow’s another day"
I’m thinking Apple blows away earnings. Q1 2019 was 1.28 that’s with iPhone 11 launching in sept Q3 meaning initial sales of iPhone 12 pushed to Q4. Reports also indicate Apple raising iphone 12 production by 30% and App Store/services up another 30%. Also M1 and covid remote work/learning NOT in Q4 2019. This makes me ballpark a 30% increase in eps for Q4 2020 vs Q4 2019 resulting in Q4 eps increase of .40 resulting in Q4 eps of 1.68 resulting in trailing twelve months PE of 38 at a stock price of 145. This doesn’t take into account large increases in free cash flow and net cash. I mean every report about lead times and number crunching says every product Apple is selling is crushin it. Any thoughts?
AAPL calls $150 exp 1/29
Be strong Apple team.  A sell off is unnecessary. Don’t contribute to tanking the stock. Prices will be back at 142 + in a hot minute especially if people don’t panic today/tomorrow and give into FUD. Hold and even buy more if any good opportunities. That’s how we win on this one! 
Tesla stock has a p/e of 1600 while apple stock is only around 36
FB beat top and bottom and down AH due to increase in expenses outlook. TSLA missed EPS and way down. AAPL should show everyone how it's done.
AAPL is a buy and hold stock. If you like trading frequently put 20% in AAPL and stop looking at it and leave the rest for trading.
Shorts on here telling people to sell right before earnings...hahahaha
I expect apple’s stock price to stay upwards of $185 by June 2021.
Tony Balooga just raised his Q1 EPS estimate from 27 cents per share to $1.08 per share........a 400% increase. Tony says the market is underestimating the Bulldozer like power Apple has in the marketplace.

The power hour we've been waiting for!

Glorious Wednesday “ AAPL to hit 155 today Like if you agree
"Apple and the big guys always had the way of taking out all the small investors before the earnings, and all the other stocks might be up and that changes the investors to put money else where. But when the earnings do come out, all the small investors come back to ride and thats where the stock skyrockets. Always been the case and always will be. buy your options on the 26th january for 29th january that has strike price above $1-2 of the stock. you will thank me later."
"Relax. “Stock markets do perform better under Democrats than under Republicans. That’s a well-known fact, but it does not imply cause and effect,” says Jeremy Siegel, the Russell E.

Anyone know what that nosedive was just now?
Apple gets a price boost to $160 from Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani who says the Apple Car will be 'a computer on wheels.'
I bought after hours. Trust in truth. Truth = beating EPS/revenues Q over Q is facts. I am accumulating since yesterday.

"Reddit’s army has joined. Shorty, you know the drill! Let’s go!!!"
"No one is getting rich trading Apple. The only ones sitting BIG pretty are those that bought a couple hundred shares before the last 2 for 1 split. They currently own 11,200 shares or about $1.5 million."
Futures red :(
"Once reality sets in, people will flock to get more Apple shares. Everything is funky right now but make no doubt, Apple is a cash machine! Like money in the bank."
"Amazing! now let the stock work for you and go watch your netflix! Don't expect to see huge spikes right away, it will go up when the institutions will have to secure their #$%$LT investment"
Tremendous ER! Well done TC! Stock will soar next 3 months. On to the Earnings Call 
$175 after earnings. easiest money you’ll ever make.
Msft up nicely today ... preview of tomorrow for Apple
Support between 136 and 138Then we are heading up again ! Don’t worry people just hold for the long term ! It will pay off !!!
It is about ready to bust 145 wide open... Pay a particular attention to the last hour of AH.
"sell the news... previous 5 sessions, apple has gone up almost 20%. This is already baked in and I do not believe it has any room to go up further. Look at MSFT it's only 4% gain after blowout qtr. The past few months there were no stimulus, lockdowns, etc and millions unemployed and no way can afford an iphone..."
Good news is you might get a $2000 check. Bad news is your taxes probably going up $4000.
"It’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon"
Calls or Puts? Vertical spreads? Entry exit to play ER? I’m think 140/150 bull call! 1000 contracts!
Doesn’t take a genius to see that stocks are being manipulated. Earning mean nothing anymore. Next time Apple goes up is x date in February? Give me a break at next to nothing dividend. Tic toc time will tell long....
hedge funds selling like mad
"I have been a long time share holder for 11 years. I have 17,020 shares. I am selling."
"Gotta love it. After the hedge fund 's satisfy their margin calls caused by the Reddit Army, AAPL will move to $150. The hedge funds ALL hold large positions in AAPL and they have to come up with the money somehow... The pain being inflicted upon the despicable #$%$ is probably the most satisfying event I've seen in the markets in my lifetime and is worth the few days it will take for AAPL to resume it's inexorable march to $150 - $160 in the near term."
One word : Buy !
Never sell Apple. Only accumulate and buy every dip. Reinvest the divi always in a dip
Cook and Zucky not helping these stock prices by engaging in a ps'n contest!
How to figure aapl stock price using Goldman Sachs’ Rod Hall’s target...use a 2x factor ...his latest target is $85...so in reality the year end target should be 2 x $85.=$170/share. I see aapl floating around $140-150 before earnings announcement...with some drop off after announcement..before further build up. A more likely case is the higher $200/sh bull case that some analysts have been pushing.
Can we see 140 today?
Money printing asset P/E inflation is here to stay. Thanks FED
Turning green
That dip was healthy a great entrance to more gains coming!
Don’t let short term disappointment steal your long term wealth ! Hold your nerve and hold apple or you will regret it in 10 years !
"as usual: record earnings, but the stock drops like a rock ..."
so comments about what Katie Couric said about Republicans is off limits on Yahoo. that is very sad.
I sent to my group to loud up on AAPL. Profit taking can not go below pre earning day level. Correction is coming soon. Buy to accumulate and hold. That's the secret. Buy any pullback and accumulate. I am buying at the opening. The short squeeze is coming
"looks like going past 136 in a few minutes, all smiles through ER next week"
"I am just curios, does anybody have an idea of how many shares Aapl owns because that is better than cash earning what 2 or 3%."
Tomorrow premarket itself it will be pumped High 135 or 134.5 and then 137 likely possible ....Friday again options day so can’t expect much ...so technically they baked in 50% of the hike before earnings ...
These earnings lower AAPL P/E ratio instantly. 111.4 billion in one quarter is amazing.
Is AAPL at 5.00 yet ?I read all those posts about how they were going to riun AAPL.Not so much I guess.
"Lol a PE ratio of 37, way too cheap for this growth stock."
"Nasdaq futures were 80 implied open at 8:00 pm. Now they are 44. I hope by morning they are green, and we are in for a huge up day."
WHAT A PIECE OF S#4#$#T!!! This is unreal! $13. in 2 days. Blow out earnings who cares I want to make a profit to!! Money trap! I don't care if you've owned you shares for years. Breaking downward resistance!
FB is recovering. AAPL is set for record quarter!
for Gods sake do not listen to Rod of GS and CNBC
Apple: .5% short floatIdiots: Shorts will have to cover! Gap up to $150 premarket!
I’m an AAPL stock holder. I strongly suggest that AAPL remain an electronics company and leave political and social media to others.
Sold all of my AAPL and bought $GME and $AMC and $htz and $M and LK coffee and $nio china golf cart maker with rice cooker engine
This is an opportunity to buy more!
"I’m loading up. can’t miss out when this hits $200 and Apples worth $3,000,000,000,000."
Apple had its best Q in India. Up 100% yoy. They sold 1.5m phones. It’s like 2008 in US. Once people start using it and loving it and word spreads....look out
How many times has the FAANG trade saved the market !!! They are the defensive stocks to buy when the futures are red !
The Market is really enjoying Obama’s Legacy coming full circle ️ Your Welcome  The chosen one.
"Let me repeat AAPL, AMD, MSFT reported great Qs, but the herd are running for the hills scare by hedge fund shorts? Yahoo don't delete my postings"
"get a share of GME, make them pay there for your loss here"
The calm before the storm $$$$
Had to take my profits. Couldn't fathom losing them. Still hoping for a strong ER...
Just tried to buy top of line iMac only to find out that Apple is out of stock till beginning of Feb. Any weakness before earnings I'm loading up!
Because we had a record breaking quarter this should recover pretty fast plus EV on the horizon
"Every time Apple starts going up, these analysts knock it down. Apple is adaptable, intelligent and innovative. They’re going nowhere but up, I started investing in it 20 years ago when people said it would be out of business in two years and just look at the charts over the long hall. They’ll blow the doors off with the earnings report and the analysts will still say, but....."
"Option players! Do not be greedy.I was watching ""Charles"" the NBA great talking about stocks. He said ""options! I finally learned to sell half when they were up 100%"""
shorts now have 19.5 hours to cover before it's to late
Missed cspan today with the bidun cabinet member speeches? Good you wont want to commit harry karry.
Who’s ready for some dog gone green?
Could you Imagine if Apple fell short ??
Apple is about to go on two 15 point runs......back to back. We have seen this setup 20 times. Get on the Train.
 announced the new Iphone 14. Just like the 12 and 13 except different color and more expensive. Never underestimate the simple people. The richest company in the world with one average product. Amazing
"Looking to sell in the next few months only because I need the cash for a down payment. Ya’ll think I should do it right after earnings, or wait till March?"
I think the problem is that the market fears a big pull back in Feb. If happens will take all stocks down 10%_20% even good ones like Apple
Going into earnings negative is better!
"Share holders own the company if unhappy vote out board and CEO, put voter resolutions on how they spend your money!"
Futures will be green at opening Europe just woke up
"Just muted more political opinions. Hello, anyone interested in AAPL news?"
"Traders said that while today’s ugly session could be the start of an orderly pullback, we could be in for some surprising moves due to the nature of the selloff. As one trader explained, ""Hedge funds were reportedly forced to sell to raise capital amid the historic short-squeeze on Wall Street, but while today’s selloff was scary, these liquidations often end with spectacular rallies like in the wake of the ‘volatility apocalypse’ exactly three years ago.”"
How is Apple down leading into their earning smh and somehow Tesla just gain and gains for literally no reason. Getting a bad feeling that Apple is going to report a historic quarter but the SP wont do much
Beat
the call is usually when apple takes a large spike in the green
Trillion dollar companies and they want to give you $0.82 dividend what a rip off
"From CNBC:” Intensifying speculative behavior among retail investors is causing concern. Heavily shorted names, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, continued to be pushed higher by amateur day traders in online chat rooms. Some investors are worried about mounting losses by hedge funds spilling over to other areas of the market as those funds sell other securities to raise cash. Investors are also concerned the speculative behavior is a sign the market is overvalued and a pullback is near.”"
Hedge Funds are selling $AAPL to cover their short on Game Stop...
"This is a waste of time, Tim Cook needs to focus on the stock not MArk at Facebook. Jesus, we need the stock to thrive not tank on stellar earnings."
If this is an indication how WS is behaving prior to earnings; just wait and see how they’ll react when Apple announces the iCar!
I really think people finally understand that the stock market is not a free market. Its controlled by big guys. People don't want to pour money in that kind of markets. I think a crash from the markets is imminent.
It’s finally waking up
"Sounds like the green new deal is taking the wind out of the market. Oh well I didn’t vote for him however, several of my dead relatives did..,,"
Here we go folks !
Red will be short lived
Last time I was trapped 136 .... it fell to 106
Look at Microsoft. Up $15 after hours yesterday. Shows you what down markets can do to a phenomenal earnings report
And in the end there will only be AAPL.. Looking to enter a huge position today as we will likely see an earnings driven rally like never before.. This will be my hedge against other market activity
Martin you made the right move keep buying and hold it for long. GLTA
Finally muted anonymous...much better
Sold my 450 shares today and I won’t be back.. I will be switching my companies 40 phones over to Samsung... I can no longer allow Big Tech to ruin our country.... this is the United States of America.... its Not China or Russia... a small protest. A drop in the bucket. It is what it is
Anyone selling here has a deep aversion to making money. You buy here. Eleven months from today the stock will be up 100%. IMHO 
Apple appears to be the only tech stock in the Green today !! Money flowing in before blow out earnings report next week.
I have a buy set for $122.00
post your earnings predictions. I say 150.00
"AAPL is the king in town now!if AAPL says no, FB, SNAP, PINS, TWTR and GOOGL can’t make ads money! AAPL EV blueprint has already started threatening TSLA! AAPL is heading 200 in January!"
If anybody tells you this is going down on here is because they are shorts!!
Apple I love you
Close above $131.
Heading up after hours
I have a small sell order in at 152... maybe I will up that to 165
"Lesson of the the day...if you're a public traded company, don't make more money in three months than most countries make in a year because the street will punish you for that."
"Hedge funds, the news, the forums EVERYONE likes AAPL but its selling off as the market goes up?"
 kind of a day for apple. no big pop but one good buy @140.
Can we just get a icar so I can retire already
$153 after earnings.
If anyone discounts we are in a bubble just look at $pltr todayFyi $spy $aapl $amzn
"If I was the Goldman Sachs analyst, I would repeat my Sell rating and $81 PT. and then look for another job as a dog-catcher"
10 years accumulated more that 15000 stocks till date Thats call saving account
"Apple is falling like a rock in a lake with no bottom. I have no other option than wait for this stock to go up because I bought in higher. I want to be optimistic, but last couple of days have made it hard to look on the bright side."
"First of all if you got in yesterday thinking this would go up, I say to you what took so long? Secondly, why in the world would you buy a 140 stock to make a ton of money overnight. Truth is the destroyed estimates on earnings yes. Doesn’t always translate immediately to share price. Oh but it will. Just don’t watch it tick like a clock. Apple is King!! Remember that"
"We better support them, Apple is going to donate 350 billion to America."
"Buying at today's prices will get pre split prices..in other words September 01,2020 price..all day long..buy the Dip.."
"""The Only Tech Stock You Need to Buy in 2021""""This stock gives investors the opportunity to take advantage of diverse tech trends.""Harsh ChauhanJan 16, 2021 at 12:35PM""The NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector index comfortably outpaced the broader stock market's returns in 2020. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a big beneficiary of that surge, as the stock gained more than 80% despite a slump in smartphone sales.Apple's other product lines and its booming services business helped it grow revenue 5.5% year over year in fiscal 2020, despite a 3.2% decline in iPhone revenue. In 2021, Apple could turn on the heat and deliver much better results than last year.The company is set to take advantage of one of the biggest tech trends -- 5G wireless technology -- in a big way.

buy amc.
I hope theyvhave enough cash to stay in business
Sold @ 108/share. Shooting myself in the foot! Bought back much higher. Holding tight this time!!
$160 after earnings....just checked my crystal ball.
Dan Ives /Wedbush just raised Apple bullish price target to $225!! He is one of the most accurate analysts out there next to Gene Munster.
Record quarter 
$137.50 After Hours.
"I am massively overweight AAPL this week, got calls on JUL16 for earnings, longs calls in 2023JAN20 and went long with calls on the weekly this week. So far so good."
"IDC predicts that in 2021, Apple AR glasses will trigger an explosion in the industry, and light and thin VR headsets will become the mainstream. $WIMI"
app revenue is up 35% yoy for Apple. 35%!...combine this with every hardware product sold out with huge demand it’s going to be a blowout quarter.
"Earnings will be epic. Cant wait to order my new Macbook Pro, new Magsafe, faster M1 processor. Outstanding technology that cant be denied."
Lol the nasdaq barely up not even .01 and people are talking about Apples performance. The bounce will come and it’ll be a vicious!
"Now, watch for AAPL Shorts to cover today...They have no other chance but do it today before close... It's going to be fun to watch last few moments today LOL!"
Look at the volume. Wow!
Shorts options expire tmw. Buy up or pay up.
"apple will make its move once all the noise subsides. It's not going to react on our terms, it will make its move on it's own terms as it has for years."
I read an article that said 9 of 10 devices activated in the 4 quarter were Apple devices .
Apple best company on market will exceed 200 in no time this bubble is real and it’s not because of stocks like amazon or Facebook or Apple it’s because of the small cap stocks that people are making into mid caps that don’t post any number that come even close to being worth it

"to the shorts, all I can say is, we still up $5 from 5 days ago!"
I already bought another 200 shares early this morning. Thanks weak hands for the bargain price.
Apple is the king. When Apple wants privacy they get privacy 
A positive day today. Additionally a big sharp rise next week after the inauguration. Market loves stability but also loves the composition of the H and S. No clear majority. Then quarterly results will be great. They have been great so far. Next week they will come pouring in. Also next round of stimulus checks on its way. I am buying a lot either my core holdings or mutual funds from Fidelity
Time for a 10:1 reverse split- only real INVESTORS will want to play then.
This was end of month repositioning plus options expiration plus some selling to cover the Reddit shorts by the hedge funds. Uptrend continues next week until ex divi on 020821
"“I think GameStop is telling markets there’s a really bitter pill to swallow right now,” Lee said on “Fast Money,” referring to the trading frenzy involving the video-game retailer that has pitted hedge funds who had shorted the stock against small investors who hyped up the name in online chat rooms."
"no drill, look at the ACRX volume. Think there is a news leak, take 10 seconds and look!Apple another 52 week high, only going higher, up that dividend!"
Yep 140 jimmy chill thinks very upbeat on earnings. Carter wirth also thinks breakout above the triple top 138. On to 150 after earnings
What innovation has $AAPL introduced in the last 3-4 years? Note: slimmer bezels are NOT innovation. Clever product pricing with pricing jumping from 64GB to 256GB storage with nothing in between is NOT innovation.
Just think of it this way: lower share prices in the short term are good for long term holders because it means Apple can buy back its shares at cheaper valuations.
Apple is on sale! I feel sorry for those who truly believe that Apple will tank. Buy now if you can.
Yesss buying 20k for tomorrow yesssssssssssssss thank you
"1-28-21. research is still overwhelming "" buy"" & ""overweight "".just sayin'....."
Apple and Microsoft GREEN tomorrow!! Garunteed kids!
CNBC just had a big segment on Apple . Everyone expecting a breakout
"If AAPL traded at the same forward PE as TSLA, Apple would be trading at $870/share right now. Think about that."
"Long time SH - zzzzzzzzzShort Term Trader - OMG OMG OMG the world is ending, it's going to 50, f this scam, get out, get out while you still cannnnnnnnnnnnnn.....Now you decide which you think has the better take on the last two days."
"Hedge funds covering their short position in GME, AMC, BB, BBY, Nok.They have to resort to selling stocks like Apple. The market to say the least is broken for now. I hope this will not be new normal."
"Stocks don’t go up in a linear fashion. They go up over time. It’s a small drop with institutional profit taking after a killer quarter. According to Jim Cramer, you don’t trade Apple stock, you own Apple stock, if you wanna day trade, go buy GME."
Months of gains wiped out in 48 hours. Typical.
The stock price of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has received a price target increase from $140 to $155 by Wells Fargo.
AAPL Very Long--waiting to hear who they will partner with -Their versionof the E Car--
People trading pennies
140$ LETS GO
"when they are done with the gme squeeze they are all gonna go shopping, and aapl sitting here with a record earnings, let this sell off all day long i dont care"
Apple going to be 150$ day after earnings. Just wait and watch.
"Ever major investment broker wants to scoop up all your cheap shares before earnings, it’s a shame a lot of people are falling for the trick. I am shocked to know people are selling because they panic. Earnings is coming up  and l am sure it will bring it up to the newest high. Be patience. U can express your frustration. But to sell?"
If aapl isn’t up tomorrow then no other stock deserves to go up tomorrow
AAPL er is good...we can see gains tomorrow and going into next week
"I fully expect this to take off once earnings is released. If it happens to dip some, just means we buy more shares. If you are in Apple, you arent in here for a quick buck. You are ok with the build and stack approach."
Not really sure what’s going on right now. I figured if the feds were going to hold interest rates where they are at the market would react in a positive manner?￼
everyone spent there money on GameStop.
TSMC is to report earnings this week on Jan 14th. If they post solid numbers expect Apple to skyrocket as well.
"Pay attention to Microsoft after hours action tomorrow. If it’s sell the news, Apple will probably do the same. If it goes higher after hours, Apple will probably go higher Wednesday after hours also"
"a company like Game Stop ,with little substance is skyrocketing and aaple can't even cross 150.00 give me a break."
Question for longs: how many shares of apple do you own?
I am out. will by back when stock price is lower.
"Apple Stock is set for a strong year with increasing demand for iPhone and iMac. Buy on those dips along the way to a $200 stock. And Anthony, get lost troublemaker!"
Get ready to fly again
Investing in Apple has been like winning the lottery once a year for 19 out of the last 20 years (2008 was a rough one).
"It's not the shorts, its the market makers, if you look at GME for the past few days, you will see that WS can manipulate any COMPANY on the up or downside, that is the bottom line, Apple is no different. Its driven by options this week. If you had any doubts, GME confirmed it!"
Wow Wnat a move
Still down AH - book it - Boolean
Margan Stanely Up grades AAPL $152: AAPL positive earnings play with positive Price Target Upgrades supported by Apple's ramped up productions. Good Luck.
SEC rules prevent AAPL from buying back stock for so many days after earnings. This may be the reason for this assault?
"There are people writing a story about the poor hedge funds and how their margin calls are our problem on this feed ! Block out that noice, buy apple, hold apple and profit from Apple A hedge funds reckless bets are not our problem! Morally or financially! The market will deal with them !"

I've held my Apple shares since 2006 and my investment of $89K have grown into almost 3/4 of a million dollars. I'll reach Apple millionaire status when Apple shares get to $200/sh, presumable by summer of 2022..."

"Apple may touch 135 and go beyond by earnings, it’s not unrealistic, apple went beyond 135 and fell back without any bad news about apple. Earnings are going to be great with immense 2021 projections. They got brilliant additions like MagSafe accessories, apple fitness services, apple chip and on and on.. I suggest buy the dip, this stock is not going to ditch you."
Love how a massive amount of people will hold strong on their shares with a terrible company like GameStop but people see a dollar drop on the best company in the world and will start to sell. SMH give me a break
Nasdaq UP So Big !! Opening Bell 135 ...
Close up $5+. You can do it.
"Today, we celebrate! "
"If you sold today, you’re weak. Q4 earnings are coming out for apple shortly. this stock will soar. apple + holiday season = boost in stock price."
Apple bought back 200 million shares in the quarter. Every 5 quarters+/- there is a billion less shares available. I hope Apple announces adding to the buyback! Once again their goal is cash neutral but with no time frame.
"Update: CNBC reported Mary Huberty of Morgan Stanley as one of the most influential Wall Street analyst and although her Upgrade is $152, her Bull case is actually $200... which aligns with Loup Venture Gene Munster's price target which is also $200. Good Luck"
Slickdeals guys! AAPL on a flash sale. possible price mistake!! get it while it lasts!
Excited for blockbuster earnings today!!!!!!!!
Apples new price target is $155.00 . We will see that soon

"Apple's Mac and iPad sales increased in fiscal 2020. These two products produced 19% of Apple's total sales. Their combined revenue was up 11.3% year-over-year, and Apple can be expected to sustain this momentum in 2021. For more hot stocks like (AAPL) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
It seems almost every time Apple is expected to have record breaking earnings the market is down.
poor shorts in the office next door. Big brief cases with lap top groaning and knaing their teeth in agony liketh it is our fault. I sayrth go long fella and beeeee happy. Thanko
"Besides today is the last day of the month that people's cashing out, these shorts are trying to recuperate some of their losses of the billions lost to GME and AMC. You sell, you loose. There's no reason AAPL should be in the red today and yesterday."
Wedbush $200 target. Wedbush's Dan Ives has always been right. Believe him.
"Tools were rediscussed today that had been previously hundreds of times before over the past 12 years for cash flow and how to ""Make lemonade out of lemons"".It does not help to complain but to ""take what the markets offer"""
"I've bought and held AAPL for over 10 years. During that time I've gained on average $100K per year. However last year I averaged $100K PER MONTH! I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it makes me think of Warren Buffett's familiar quote: ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful."""

"To newbies of AAPL. Don’t be intimidated by negative posts, they are by short sellers and those with other motives too long to list. Hold long and be assured you will not regret it."
AOC involved in the stock market ?What could go wrong ?
Ok everyone the election is over nothing is going to change. Conversations on this site should be in regard to stocks in particular AAPL. I do not think I am alone in my opinion. AAPL should be testing the year high by the end of the month.
"Kids in your 20’s early 30’s try to accumulate 200 to 300 shares. Keep it, when you are 55 will be sitting pretty."

My brokers servers are down. What is happening to apple people ??
What reason is there for a 70 billion increase in value pre market? THIS IS A BUBBLE....134 people cheering this price higher each day. Even if earnings are good....the Value is poor 42 times EPS. From 2015 to 2017 this traded for 15 times EPS.

MSFT indicator - tomorrow AAPL smashed earnings!! Huge !!
What’s happening with Apple stock price? It’s so painful to see the current price even thought it’s just had best earning in Q4.
Pretty much everything up except AAPL and TSLA. I can understand TSLA being down but not AAPL. Not too concerned though. This thing is a cash machine

"SPEND SOME OF YOUR WEEKEND ON READING STOCK MARKET HISTORY. DOTCOM IMPLOSION AND 2008 MARKET CRASH. it appears that much of that ongoing fed liquidity in the form of stimulus checks is being used to devilishly manipulate sectors of the market, WITH A VERY OBVIOUS DOMINO EFFECT"
Can Apple come up clutch like Microsoft?
Patience Weak Hands getting out....bide your time the fundamentals always prevail. Apples earnings just to good.
"Yesterday was triple witching when stock, index and ? (Any help) monthly options expire.This on top of the social/political climate issues was a real head wind to our rally attempt.The early am algorithim rally was there but it was short lived. It started to look like a ""W"" shaping up but there was no interest at the end of the dayWhat surprises me is how AAPL dipped back to $126+ in after hours.If it prints $126+ on Monday that will be the seventh time in past how many days AAPL traded between $126 and $130+Some laugh but a dripping faucet fills a bucket too!"
"bought game stop at the open today for 265, sold 30 minutes later for 480.35. the easiest 215 points of my career. right now it is 237.86, the bubble burst finally."
A few skeezy shorts make a bad bet and all retail must pay for their mistake - this is outrageous.
$145 SEEMS FAR AT THIS POINT:/
"so sick of the tv telling us that this cant happen and you have $w , $sq, $pton, $aapl all way overvalued to the point that they think its ok.... whatever people buy what they want get over it"
we learned one lesson from all this frenzy. the stock market is 100% manipulated and good news or bad news have really little impact .no different from casino.
Apple will have huge earning this year that’s what I feel.
$170 soon to come. Apple broke all time hight 100 billion revenue
"Apple will announce an earnings beat end of month. Further out, expect a dividend increase in April. What's not to love? Own it and hold long. You're being rewarded for investing in this company. Although I should add that the dividend is not the main reason to invest in this stock, it is like a cherry on top of an ice cream float. Beats having a savings account though. ;)"
Sold short on January 20 making lots of $$$$. Thank you 46!
"Last 30 days, Apples net gain is 0 while all indices are at 52 weeks high, all Apple suppliers stock on the moon except Apple itself....that hurts"
We all know this is going to $200. The question is when. Next week or next month?
"I remember folks saying Apple had peaked about 5 years and 1.6 Trillion dollars ago. So when you start hearing that rhetoric, ignore."
Apple is not a good day trading stock - just sayin
The earnings is blowing up!! EPS 1.68 vs analysts consensus of 1.41. This is HUGE!!!!
"This GS Analyst really hates Apple - ""Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall reiterated his sell rating on Apple (AAPL) shares late Thursday, arguing that the current iPhone upgrade cycle looks more like a typical redesign cycle rather than the “supercycle” some were hoping for. Hall has been bearish on Apple’s stock since April 2020."""
"You know what's un American Joe? Not allowing the votes to be audited, how come Joe? There is nothing classified in those machines."
1-hour to market close ! place your bets :)
I see green!
We are going to rally the rest of week after sell the news....the numbers are just to good
"Goldman raised their PT on Apple from $75 to $85 this morning based on brisk China sales. Grudging as it is, even they recognize a blowout earnings report is coming!"
Recall Governor Cuomo! Let’s begin now!
Implied volatility is very high estimates for a 10% change + or -
gme profits will go into apple. then Apple will skyrocket
"The late morning sell-off was a shorty trap, AAPL traded higher highs for the remaining of the day. Good Luck"
Can this close above 139 today ?
"So are we ""longterm"" investors that don't like to trade bankrupt companies mentioned on reddit going to lose all our money because now hedge funds have to sell real companies' stocks to cover losses from that joke that just happened?"
I am thinking sell right before earnings hopefully near the $150 mark. At that much the good news is already baked in.
"today was an important lesson for all.It really speaks volumes how option action rule stock action.It was the option action that drove AAPL to $145 before earnings. But every coin has two sides. Everyone was on the same trade and the markets did what they always do when that happens - went the opposite way to kill the premium.This has happened before. As the board historian I did warn on Tuesday and pre-market on Wednesday.Despite that, WE were wrong. WE apologize"
It’s hard to understand the logic of these AH sellers given the stellar results for Q1 by Apple across all performance benchmarks.
Need sterling report and bounce in market futures. Held up pretty well today so let’s see.
funny how the market takes a breather and shorties think it's the end of the world
"Record App store sales, record iPhone sales, and now Gartner says Apple had record Mac sales in the 1st quarter. Why would anyone sell now? Principles don't make you money!"
"AAPL is the best growth stock around.. However, everyone forgets about AAPL's dividend: $.82/ share. Yeah its low but expected to grow close to 10% / year for next 3-5 years st a minimum. In early 2014, if you had only 1000 shares, today you would have 28000. In 10 years the dividend on that money will be returning $2-3/share or $56,000+/ year. Not too bad for the greatest growth stock around. Buy and hold forever and live off the dividends"
"Almost up a dollar premarket. After Netflix earnings, people are excited about Apple's earnings next week. Short squeeze today and about to take off!!"
I'll be taking that.
Gotta love it. Big guys cry about the Reddit army then you see APPLE have a blow out earnings and it’s down 2%. Wonder why lol
"This year is definitely the year of APPLE. As a retiree it is such a pleasurable experience to check AAPL quote on my APPLE phone numerous times a day and I am practically never disappointed, now that is a routine every retiree should experience."
Looos like the rest of red stocks come back to lifetime for apple now
I just bought few now for the first time. Was it a wrong time to enter? Considering we have earnings reports coming up tomorrow I guess?
"My BMO trades take forever to fill because of the volume in those ""squeeze the shorts' trades like GME, AMC, ... AMC volume is at 250 millions..."
"People need to stop upgrading their iPhones (or other expensive phones) every year or even every 3 years. Buy a new phone when the current one stops working. Seriously people, have you thought about the huge environmental impact of this?"
"The current state of our stock market is in bizarro world. A solid company like Apple reports a phenomenal quarter and the price goes down, but GME goes through the roof because of a concentrated forum collaboration. There is no science to this anymore."
"Apple stock is the canary in the goldmine tomorrow. Watch closely. Full disclosure: I bought apple on Tuesday and sold tonight after the market closed and after I heard GameStop was full on for trading tomorrow. I got into GameStop last May and have been riding that bull. In my opinion apple will be one of the first indicators there is a problem in the market tomorrow. It is quick and easy for institutions to get large shares in and out without moving the needle to much. In other words,, there might be selling of apple to cover other risks in the market. I am not an financial advisor or trading professional and please take this advice after you conduct your on Due Diligence. I’m just an average dude making my own observations. Moreover, I have never shorted a stock and have zero intentions to short apple now or in the future."
"Those who keep posting about Morgan Stanley predictions, you need to do your research on these analyst. They have been wrong on 3/4 of their predictions this year, or told you wrong on purpose, to manipulate you and take your money. That’s the name of the game, and if you don’t do your DD you’ll most likely lose your money over and over, and that’s not just for MS, that’s for all these big hitters, check their holdings and their track record before taking their advise."
I joined appl as an employee in May 2020. My stock grant was 350k over 4 years. That is now worth over 500k.
Apple had an amazing quarter! The best ever in history among any smart phone. The eye-opener in this earnings report is that the Apple stores weren’t open because of the pandemic. Imagine if the stores were open and how many more phones they would’ve sold. Unbelievable report. The stock will definitely double this year.
GREEN
"Last night and earlier today, WE did comment about how this happen years past and could happen today Then the earnings report was great too but markets took stock down to kill option premium. The rally happen the following week.After the open, If the algorithim players get onboard, AAPL will pivot then rally and not wait for next week.Operative word is ""After"" the open"
Stocktwits sentiment index up 1.69 % for Apple for today which translates to Apple being up by at least two dollars today
I’m glad this backed off some and reset just before ER. That means it will pop big on a great ER. 160+ Is very possible tomorrow AH. I expect we see 145-147 during day tomorrow.
"imagine, a company with great products, earning based on actual performance beats all expectations year after year. This is how it should be.where as... a game developer that will be gone in a year with nothing but software that could be sold anywhere... go figure! Hedge funds and Market Manipulators don't like it when someone else beats them at their own game...Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman said exchanges and regulators needed to pay attention to the potential for ""pump and dump"" schemes driven by chatter on social media."
Shorts getting B- slapped by Katy Huberty and Gene Munster's price target $200 AAPL! Good Luck
the selling of apple and facebook was done by Algorathisms. big guys are getting out.
"bought more at 135 thinking that was going to be the bottom. this thing is free falling like a sky diver without a parachute. long term hold. better days ahead, but it could be a while."
No longer “Don’t miss the train”. Get on board: Don’t MISS The .
"There you go, Apple finally broke through $135 and it stuck! Yay."
Today Nasq will be upAAPL will close over $145 tomorrow $148 if we can get to $149-150 we are in position for a pop bestEver earnings this will move $167-175 +
"IF Apple has an earnings call like Netflix did, we’re looking at $165 immediately; and that’s if no gains before earnings (~18%).Everyone seems to be going all-in on everything big Tech; no issues pushing these stocks to stratosphere."
The battle between traders and investors goes on every day. Today the traders are winning.
apple is invulnerable to any recession. people will line up to buy $1000 phones
"It is mind boggling - AAPL is down and the WS darling TSLA is up! With all the anticipation of AAPL's earnings. I own both but more of AAPL. I've been reading and watching as well the last few days financial reports regarding this week's earnings, and it seems most analysts have lost touch about P/E and fundamentals. Especially when it comes to TSLA. They keep talking about how exciting to see first time young investors coming into the market and so forth. It appears, they have accepted the unreal bubble that it commands."
"it's kind of vad if you have call options. but if you own actuall shares you don't have to worry about this, seriously."
A blooming APPLE a day keeps the shorts at bay. To my long holders of AAPL enjoy the journey and the best is yet to come.
"I think this will be Green by the end of the day, imo."
"Le me share a theory with you. Megacap stocks, including AAPL, will tank in the coming days (short-term) because big funds who have been playing the shorting game will be forced to raise cash to cover their bets. And they will probably start by selling some of their 2020 winners. I would not be surprised if that impact is so strong that we go below the 50 day EMA and could even touch the 200 day. So nothing to do with the stock's intrinsic value or future prospects, but rather the rather futile short-term liquidity needs of hedge funds.Let me hear your thinking on this."
"I’m watching Microsoft, which probably will report blowout earnings. Will it go higher or sell off? That will be a hint how AAPL shares move Thursday"
Just bought some more :P
Apple will trend higher all the way to our Apple Car announcement in March
TSM up 10%. This is the bottom before earnings. Today all major stocks + or - 0.5%. Apple will be green by EOD. Very good buying opportunity especially calls either for short term or long term
bought the 3.00 dip. thanks
"Let’s go AAPL, let’s squeeze out shorties, you got true believers rooting for you!"
There are many times more Apple shares in short position than GameStop shares in short position. Don’t be surprised if Apple moves up 100 points in 10 minutes.
Apple crushed it. Patience. Good buying opportunity.
this GME saga proves the game is rigged and will fail.
"I have learned a very valuable lesson here. Always do the opposite on people say on these message boards and listen only to yourself. Missed out on $10,000 profit. Will sell a % at $130."
cup and handle even stronger today....cup shows $154+
Thank goodness it's Friday. My heart can't take another day!!!
If earnings for last quarter will be 100 Billion dollars then AAPL will cross $200 very very quickly.
The Eye is God and Everyone reincarnates !What happens is nothing like the Bible says will happen!Obviously the Church lied !Heaven is what the Womb feels like to a Spirit that needs a new body !Almost impossible to believe and exactly what happens !God is your Mother ?
Will APPLE CREATE A SEARCH ENGINE TO DOMINATE GOOGLE? Imagine if APPLE discontinued using and paying Google by creating iSearch. Apple has mentioned it as a possibility before. Can you say APPLE WORTH $5 Trillion......?!Long Apple
nice little dip should close $139 or higher loving $137 calls for today!
"Apple will be at $135 by the end of this week. And in the ball park of $137-139 before earnings. You can see an upside from the earning of 5-8%, making this stock go to $147 to $155. I am ready to bet on this. Dan From web bush said this quarter will be a blockbuster!! $116-125 billion in revenue. Let’s go"
150 today
Carter on options action said Apple has a triple top now. Retested 138 three times and now broke above it. Very bullish. He sees it hitting 150 in earnings.
As soon as the “short squeezes” are done Apple will go up
Remember Cramer don’t run the stock market! Do you think warren buffet listens to him? Don’t think so.
I sold my tech stocks today. Made lots of money. Going on a cruise this Summer and enjoy my profits.
"We will see another $3-4 tomorrow and Wednesday. After the bell on Wednesday, another $5.00. I think we will be sitting in a range of $151-155 on Thursday."
Ya think Appl is buying another 200 mil shares at these prices?
"I don't own any AAPL devices,but I love the stock!"
I know Apple has reacted the same after ER in the past. Just crazy how they can have record earnings and drop two straight days. The market is a weird place
Don’t miss the train .. Jump in early morning BB the future .. to the moon Blackberry and Chinese search engine giant Baidu have agreed to expand a partnership that aims to give automakers the tools they need to launch next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.
Where can you find after hours info?Thanks
see everyone at 150 soon
if you don’t buy tomorrow your gonna miss on $50 per share this week.
I would hope to see 150-160 after earnings!
"Kevin and Larry, I suggest y’all stick your day job"
450 shares of aapl and loving the ride up
Guyzz! Let Me show somethingAs far as Shorted shares volume The GME is third behind the TSLA and AAPL!Now read this:https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/
I still don’t see anything why the markets are plunging.
"C'mon Redditors, give a brother a break here. Put up some 'Buy AAPL' memes."
"The biggest institutional shareholders of AAPL (Vanguard,Berkshire,BlackRock & StateStreet own 30%) never intend to permanently sell a single share. So they care less if AAPL price goes up. So how do they derive a nice ongoing income from their position? By using every illegal means necessary to suppress AAPL to the same price forever..."
Short sellers manipulation here..........................GME crowd coming soon......................
"Just for comparison purposes, about Apples P/E of 40. Amazon P/E 95, Netflix 87, Tesla 670....got it??"
"I set a buy order at 137, 188, 138, 140. When Apple flight , flight quick. 145 today will happen. My keyword is not fast to catch good breaking point. Also I'll buy at the 1st candle. I don't care if drop, i have extra cash if pulldown to buy more"
Rod Hall bearish on Apple for soooo long. Years and years he’s been a vocal bear. Man the amount of money he has lost for people over the years must be staggering
Ahhhhhhh it hurts- should’ve bought GameStop
"If u didn’t sell in the $140s, don’t sell now. This thing will come back. It always does"
We will have so many upgrades in the morning lol
Next week this will go green
"A new report by Flurry Analytics states that nine of the top ten smartphones activated on Christmas Day 2020 in the United States were iPhones.Christmas Day in the United States is the single greatest day for new smartphone activations, so it represents a unique opportunity to analyse consumer preferences.The iPhone 11 was the most activated device on Christmas Day, with activations five percent higher than the trailing average of the period between December 18 and December 24. This is the second consecutive year that the iPhone 11 has taken the top spot, followed by the iPhone XR. The leading premium device was the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which has continued to see ""strong and long-lasting demand.""This ranking is in line with normal trends, as Apple's newer and higher-end devices generally only surge around launch due to early adopters. The iPhone 12 has made gains as users gradually replace their existing devices in the months after launch. Some smartphones, such as the iPhone XR, were not more popular than the trailing average for that device, meaning that it was not necessarily a popular gift for Christmas, but rather just a popular smartphone.The only non-Apple device to reach the top 10 was LG's budget K30 smartphone. Overall, budget devices dominated the top ten, with the iPhone SE and LG K30 seeing 34 percent and 181 percent surges respectively. Flurry believes that the success of past years' models, such as the iPhone 11 and iPhone XR, indicates that American consumers were more price-sensitive this holiday season.One notable exception from the top ten is the iPhone 12 mini, which has seemingly failed to catch consumers' attention as much as other devices, perhaps due to its discount of only $100 compared to the larger iPhone 12.This year, smartphone activations were down 23 percent year-on-year. Flurry speculates that this may be due to financial hardships, more limited family gatherings, or more spread out gift-giving this year.Flurry Analytics uses data from over one million mobile applications, providing insights from two billion mobile devices per month, and it will soon report on the full month of December to give a fuller picture of smartphone activations."
How can I download the free speech Parler app ?Is it on the App Store ?What happened ???
Saw this coming but of course bought more before earnings. A company that continues to outperform others time and time again. A year from now this won’t matter that we’re down today
What Apple has done to Parler - i will never invest in their company again. Shares products etc. there are plenty of great other companies out there. Freedom of speech is something not to be taken lightly. Apple has no business being political. All of the social media companies have no business being political. FB Amazon Google Apple Got rid of all that could be any of support to them and won’t be part of their money making machine. At the end of the day they only reason they make money is because of each individual. They should be paying the people not your liberal party In the government
Funny 111 billion and no upgrades yet
"According to the article trending yesterday analyzing people who have over a million invested in the market (1) only 9% are rotating into other sectors such as consumer discretionary, financial and banking (2) the over all favorites continue to be health care and TECHNOLOGY (3) over all very upbeat that the bull market will continue in 2021"
I won't start to get excited about today's move until after 10:15am when things settle in. Then there's always the last five minutes of the day when the real trading begins.
FIRST $100B QUARTER IN HISTORY!!!!!!!!!
Do you think earning are priced in after yesterday's drop? Or is this running tomorrow?
Rewarding day for us longs! Let’s keep this up through earnings
Remember the days when blowout earning raised PPS? Different times. Corrupt
Apple reached an all time high at 143.07
3 minutes to earnings. A bit nervous but optimistic.
Can we close above 137 today ?
"Do yourself a favour and don’t wait to buy AH or tomorrow, order now before it does exactly what MSFT did yesterday"
Hedge funds playing games with this stock
A true winner and very reliable stock 
buy more ! I say ! buy more !
Its simple buy several weeks before the earnings release then sale right before the earnings release then buy again the dip after earnings release then sale again at new highs.
"The numbers should blow away the estimates, but what will really matter will be how the services sector is doing? What Cook says about services will determine how investors react to the earnings call IMO? Hardware purchases are a big chunk of Apples revenue, but services are the the future! I think the direction that the share price takes after the earnings call will be determined by what cook has to say about Apple's services sector?"
"This is the first time I bought 75% of my portfolio on a single stock, Apple. I had been told to diversify, but this seemed to be a no brainer. I had lost a lot of money buying Apple expensive and selling cheep, and this was supposed to be the perfect opportunity to balance the books. Am I going to the extreme by not being more conservative?"
watch this take off tomorrow.
I wish everyone the best this week looks like a great start
"Short squeeze will come to AAPL. The truth will prevail. EPS/revenues are truth, and current earnings doesn't reflect the current price. AAPL should at least be 170 after hrs. But the shorties will be wiped out eventually like gamestop . Keep buying at pullbacks and accumulate. The fed has nothing to do with AAPL peformance. Customers love apple products regardless covid or not. Quarantine or not. Apple price should sustain in uptrend mode cuz APPL beat Q over Q. Fiscal year over FY..buy"
"For those that are selling your shares as a protest statement don’t forget all of your mutual funds, retirement accounts etc that hold shares of AAPL and other tech companies."
Just ran some math. If Apple beats estimates by 16 cents then with the current PE that puts the stock at $156. Without multiple expansion or an even higher beat then I believe this would be one of the best short term outcomes.
Who is buying into Apple.. have some news gonna beat earnings by a ton? 
New high tomorrow
Wow Apple dropped!!! Why??? 111 billions earnings
"I am tempted to pull everything out of the market.Biden giving the store away, the fed making monumental mistakes,Washington DC going socialist.What can go wrong."
That cup and handle on the one year chart is a thing of beauty
"At the end this will move to $150 then $160 , the quarter and future are very very bright buy this now ."
Definitely $400 on its way. Futures turned around beautifully and why shouldn't they!
Wall Street bets needs to chill.
You can blame Goldman for Apple drop today
dropping because facebook missed
Just buy and hold boys and girls Apples got the smartest in the World Working extra hard for Us Investors. Sit back and Relax. Price target for eoy $190-215 boys and girls
"I've been holding Apple for 20 years. This pattern is predictable:-) Stock runs up to big announcement-) Stock falls the day after big announcement-) Stock recovers within a short time (for me, even a year is a short time. YMMV)-) Stock overall performance is higherThus, anyone who recognizes this, and adds to their position the day after, is doing very very well. I still own 7000 shares I bought in December 2000. But over the years, I've added SIGNIFCANTLY MORE, during times like this. And I retired at age 45 (now 57). My only market talents are: Intelligence and Patience."
this was an extremely disappointing day for us options holders 
When I look up I see something so delicious I see $400 for Apple by December 2021. The problem is the shorts haven’t had any thing delicious in a long time
Massive beat!!
Non event. Things will calm down. Meanwhile Dow is soaring and Tesla is soaring.
"For publicly traded companies, stock performance is the barometer of company’s performance. Do Apple Amzn and other big tech look at their stock price and ponder what they could do to boost investors confidence? Like Elon always does, may be we need tweeting CEOs, right?"
I bought a bunch at $130. It's a steal at this price. Not worth anything less than $135 right now!!
will someone please explain in simple terms why apple is down after blowing out the quarter with unbelievable revenue etc.
"Wow just passed 1,000 people in the forum!"

"Apple fallowing undervalued AMD, undervalued MSFT after great Q reports goes down..........I want the rest of my holdings to report a lost so it can go up lol................"
"This is funny!Someone just sold 1,600 Jan 22 $60 puts for $1....Keep $160,000 or must buy AAPL at $59"
"Guys, this is not finished. Has nothing to do with fundamentals.Hedge funds are desperate to raise cash to cover their loss making short bets, and AAPL is one of the stocks, if not the stock that is most owned by these funds. I would stay away from most high tech large caps for a while, especially the ones that have provided sizeable gains in 2020, which they can now sell showing a profit.Long - term I am very bullish on AAPL, but there will be better entry points. I am starting to think that we might go all the way to the 200 moving average line. Of course most of the other stocks will follow, but this one will suffer more because it's where cash can be raised faster, for the sheer size of their investments here."
this is going to touch 150 tomorrow
Massive earnings beat.
Calls bought by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf
This will arise after lunchtime.
I see that “hedge funds” have suddenly become Public Enemy #1 on this message board today.
The market spoke today. Apple will rule the waves as we sail into 2021 and beyond.
Strange action after TSM blowout news who is big supplier for apple!
"Why are people bugging out, this is an investment stock not a trading."
"I made a big mistake buying this stock a month ago, i was ahead 30k and now its diminishing to nothing. Tesla was the stock to own, Wall Street played it perfect and made plenty on it. Apple will be like P&G, stable but no real gains for a long time. They need to get the Icar out and then we can relive Tesla all over again."
"Don’t worry about the short term drops. The market is gaining huge exposure in the younger community due to GME, NOK, and AMC. These people won’t simply stop investing once the volatility is gone. Their money will be spread across the market, especially well known names such as Apple. Hold and enjoy the ride."
China sales up from 13B to 21B. Really no need for debate anymore. Just add on any dip.
After Fed economic policies update 2 PM the market will U turn upside. Stay positive relax and stay AAPL long.
"At the end of all this, people will come back and buy some apple (i hope)"
thanks for the gift. I'll buy all day.
"fair market all I want, not manipulated by any entity"
"Congrats to all apple shareholders on the 111B Q report! Though, I'm wondering why were down on the aftermarket? Shouldn't apple shares increase in price right now?!?!?"
All kinds of price target upgrades and still moving down. I guess we need to be patient
"If you’re long apple, these are the good old days"
How can anyone not be bullish here?
I guess the idoits on reddit selling apple to buy gme ? what has this world come too?

ALERT Reuters AHSouth Korean LG Display reported super earning due to record Appl phone shipment !
i had a dream AAPL were fliting around 200/share days before earning. I ordered my bank to wire all my money to my brokerage by tomorrow. I have 750k ready for tomorrow. i ordered few laptops and still has not arrived. i asked too many orders on the last week of dec. Pretty sure EPS/revenues already surpassed its consensus. I hope my money come quick tomorrow before any pop or rally. I want a good entry price. I am pretty sure AAPL will head 200
The only way Apple was going up today was if they did 300 billion in revenue for the quarter. The move was built in and they sold on the news. Soon though a move upward is coming
Anyone here know anyone who bought an AAPL product in Q4?Anyone here know anyone planning to buy an AAPL product in Q1?

If you took a trillion off the market cap (1 trillion / 17 billion shares) it would be a drop of 59 dollars per share. Stock is at 139....so if the stock were at $80 per share and the forecasted high earnings for 2022 is 5.07/share on 367 billion in sales. PE would be 16. It would be attractive then from a valuation standpoint.
Great earnings next week and then dividends on the following week. No wonder everyone is buying this now. No more shorting this stock!!
$AAPL To the Moon! 
Undue optimism walks hand in hand with the bad investor.
Even when earnings today are blowout it won’t matter. We have a level IV dementia patient in the WH doing his best Blazing Saddles Governor routine.
"All the bank stocks hitting high even in zero interest environment...industrials, cyclicals, materials, anything you name it- at 52 weeks high. Only big tech is sitting out as funds are rotating out of big tech. It’s frustrating to see daily decline on Green Day’s which is why we vent out. But we all know the big tech will have an average 30-40% yearly return in 5-10 years. The issue is most of us are short term investors. Hopefully, we see some strong buying next week during the shortened trading week and get ready for blowout earnings. $aapl, $amzn, $fb, $google"
People keep asking about a bubble out it to rest it’s shorts trying to hold there position. Ain’t no one on this chat worried about waking up and warning you about some bubble. No one cares about the next guys finances use your head people. Apple will have fantastic earnings with the release of the iPhone 12 sold out world wide.
"APPLE EARNINGS ARENT EVEN OUT LOL AND SHORTS ARE SAYING ""MISSED"""
GET IN BEFORE EARNINGS. CLOSES 145.8 TOMORROW
"should keep going higher up to earnings next week, I'm thinking the stock will be 139-142 at ER, those looking to buy should probably start now"
By 9:35 this will be $138
That’s the record quarter I’ve been looking for
"The whole market is down, not only apple.. tesla went under 800If everything gets back to normal next week youl see that earnings taking real quick effect at the stock price."
next quarter will be even better
I am investing my hard-earned money for the future of this company. Long AAPL.
"What I like best about this market is, stocks fall a lot faster than they go up."
YES APPLE! -- WE ARE GOING GREEN!
Obvious by now the holders of 5 billion AAPL shares can do whatever they want to the price without investigation. Only consolation is that they must allow it to go up at some point this year to retain their fund customers.
At greg this stock isn’t tesla. Did you ever go to the tractor pulls? They just pull n pull with a steady momentum. Apple just keeps pulling slow n steady to finish line. Yr after yr. its a trustworthy stock thats relatively safe that you can hand down to your kids or grandkids n still have some for yourself.
I overheard that with the new president the stock market will crash once to balance out the economy market what do you guys think since im a newbie i get worry alot
APPL running to $190 after earnings like morgan stanley was saying. They always predict well.
Is it to early to have a cold beer wait till Wednesday
Poor response after the best quarter of the year ...... what if they miss the next 1-2 low-season quarters ?? Crashing ?? lol
People have zero patience. This is a long term hold. Does it really matter what it hits this week. I’ve had this stock for over 7 years and don’t plan on selling anytime soon. Calm down. And enjoy the ride
"Yawn. No news, no Fed action, punt. Nothing changes. APPL to the moon !"
not sure buying dip and selling high will work how much longer
"Easy to hold when you are in your 20’s 30’s even 40’s but in 60’s and in 70’s where your savings are in the stock market your ceiling of tolerance is not as high even with the safety net of a great stock as AAPL. just look at yesterday and today, truly a disappointment. So regretfully my wife and I will be faced with a decision to hold or sell APPLE tomorrow. We truly hope for a positive AAPL day as it will postpone any forced exit from this great company."
This should make all small investors in Aapl really mad. Don't you see the big money boys have gotten together and MANIPULATED Aapl and other stocks from 145 down to now. Complaining to the SEC will not do any good. (I tried and got zero results) Congress has got to get involved to straighten out the market. Prices should go up and down based on earnings and expected future results. If Aapl exec are smart they should buyback 2 B as promised between NOW and 160.
Apple phone sales grow 100% year over year in India? Oh My God.......Nobody even dreamed that could happen. This is a Triple Grand Slam SuperCycle.......And it’s just starting.
I thought this was about Apple but I see it’s turning political. I don’t want the vaccine so you can have mine. The Tuskegee Experiment was enough fir me. I hope they have enough for you Dennis!
"Entire market is up, and Apple, who’s doing great, is down. Am I missing something?"
All time high. Long since 2014. If you're long too pour yourself a drink this weekend. Thanks Apple.
"i told you to reserve cash so you can buy now..opportunity to buy now: AAPL, V, CRM...Uptredn contunues...Solid earnings on AAPL and all FAANG has been roboust...buymore"
"sooner or later it will recover with better gains, nothing to worty about on a company with that strong fundamentals"
"""Everyone wets their beak!""The investors waited patiently this past month while traders traded.Now, it is time for the investors.It is only fair.Have a great week."
Futures dropping. The “I’ve got a plan VegetableJoe market is just getting started. Man did you Demshevicks screw the pooch. In for a world of economic hurt with that shark eyed dementia patient at the helm.
finished speaking with CEO Tim cook and he said he is going to unload havoc on the shorts on Wednesday AH
"So we are getting higher taxes, higher interest rates, and our retirements are going down? It's only been one week"
Why is this down - I’m conflicted and confused. Can any one shed light. No robots auto response please - Thanks
"Slow and steady, bought 5 more shares Monday, all I could afford, but wow, good timing.. :-) cheers... Goal is 1,000 shares by the time I retire...."

$AAPL Reports BOGUS iPhone Sales! There is a record amount of iPhon RETURNS! https://www.investopedia.com/apple-aapl-sees-increased-complaints-about-iphone-12-5090203
Bad luck for AAPL investors ! Great earnings news on a down day in the market! Should be up 5% in after hours! Just keep the faith and AAPL will be fine!
Higher highs tomorrow and then Wednesday. What a great time to be an apple long term investor
"Rumor is they may announce the ""Apple Car"" tonight!"
What is happening to the market
Omg Apple in India booming like crazy.. guys India is the next market.. Apple to 3 trillion
Dont sweat the last couple days. This is a 400.00 stock. 200.00 eoy!!
"To all those who claim they are buying. You Must Be The Only Ones! No sense of urgency at all. Look at the charts no resistance until 130-132ish. I afraid that is where this is going. Already down 10 points from it's high. First Cramer said spac's needed the money so they sold Apple. Today it's hedge funds selling for liquidty to cover shorts in the reddit attack stocks. So what now? We all talk up how great next quarter is going to be?? Yeah Ok, I hope I am wrong."

My post are being deleted !Yahoo finance is in bed with the hedge funds! Buy Apple Hold Apple Profit from Apple 
Still way overvalued. Growth is 10% and stock grown 70%. Will correct in long run.
Every quarter every analyst makes there predictions always states Apple Dosent look good. Problems with China Problems with store closings problems with anything And every quarter since 48-50 quarters Apple seems to shove itUp there Tail pipes
The market is reacting the the White House press conferences over this past week. You can't get anymore anti-business friendly. Elections have consequences.
"Bought apple shares, still have some money left"
$1.9T stimulus and AAPL up .30c on this news? People just put the $600 down on the new Earpods. They will need new IPHOnes or IMacs with $1600 coming
Probably seen a lot of late buying this afternoon heading in ER.
Big dollar tech stocks are going to crash the market$AMZN $AAPL FB $TWTR
"I have owned aapl for many years. it was 2018 or early 2019 when it crushed earnings, and pounded the stock from 110 to 95. It took 2 weeks to make it back to 110. oh, buy the way, that was pre 4.1 split. what does that tell ya."
"Every line of product above expectations except Mac which was in line according to cnbc. China sales up 60%, great entry time as stock goes down after hours ."
why is this not in the green yet !!
I've a feeling analyst upgrades will start coming in...
FEBRUARY 19th $130-$135 CALLS. BUY THEM CHEAPER AS AAPL GOES LOWER.AVERAGE DOWN. 
"Patience. It will turn around and close above 145, we’re still have 3 more hours to close."
GameStop pre market compared to Apple just sums it all up really
APPL just had 10% CORRECTION. Do you know what happens after that in 2-4 weeks?
bought 30 shares last week. caught the dip at 141.98 yesterday and bought an other 50I have also 200 calls hopefully we will see double digit after hours
Agreed. Once the numbers fully digested and analyst upgrades and PT increases tomorrow we rally to 150 quickly
"Peter Lynch, one of the greatest investors of our time for those who don't know him, said let your winners run. That means never cut or reduce your holdings when you have a winner. Always remember that. Let the winners run. That basically translates to own it don't trade it. :)"
I don’t understand... is it really going down because hedge fund selling to cover their loss on FOMO stocks?
Monday AAPL will see its biggest gap up ever.
A loud BOOM will reverberate around the world at 4:30.
Tony Balooga just raised his Q1 estimates for Apple again. $92 Billion Revenue and $1.10 EPS.
Msft had great earnings on Tuesday and the Wed the stock went down. Today it is up almost 4%. I think the same will happen with aapl as they had great earning wed and today the stock is down. Analysts have increased their target prices as high as $170. I think tomorrow aapl will be above $145 and longer term $154+
i bought at 144 
No matter what - AAPL is going to ring above $150 - and there is nothing U can do about it.
"Amazing, best ever qtr AAPL goes up 3%. (Then gives it all back) Any whiff of a problem and we're down 10%. Then drift lower eventually giving back 20%."
"On earnings day, AAPL could be 145$ (or more!) per share! Morgan Stanley target price is 152$."
Terrific report. Congrats to Apple management. MSFT was a tough act to follow - but you did it.
Looks like AAPL had an exhaustion top of $145.09 on 01/25/2021.Correction time?
"If I had a dollar for every conspiracy theorist who blamed ""hedge funds"" for their problems today, I'd be a millionaire. Wait a second... I have over a million dollars of AAPL right now, so I already am one."
Good earning expected ... like MSFT .. i bet
Waiting .....
After historic earnings you have got to be kidding me that there are more sellers than buyers!
Yo Trumpsters! Thanks for covering my aapl and amzn stocks!! Parler is really missed on these 2 companies platforms.
So who even cares about the pre-market? $150 + today.
$111 Billion revenue (IN ONE QUARTER) on 39% gross margins for a $2.3 TRILLION company ! Long & Strong STILL. More upgrades are sure to follow. Forget about any short term hiccups there MAY be. We're good Apple family. Cheers !
cmon apple
"I pray for AAPL to be up tomorrow that market open green. so far AMZN ,TSLA are the red DOW components.I can't afford buying AAPL."
"Fully Valued at 43 times earnings, in the 1980's if a stock got to 20 times it was overvalued"
EVERYBODY KNEW IT THAT THE MARKET WILL GO UP TODAY IS ALWAYS LIKE THIS WHEN THERE A BIG DROP WILL BE NEXT DAY GREEN THE FED LOWERING THE MARKET SO PEOPLE'S CAN BUY CHEAPER STOCKS
people are dumping NIO after NIO day and buying $GM and $aapl.trending for last 5 trading days!I guess they feel more safe with staying with American We Can Trust!
Monday will be $150. I am all in on apple 
$140 support to be tested again today ahead of ER.
you guys think APPL will beat on earnings tonight???
Wisdom of crowds: Will AAPL provide positive or negative surprise on next earnings? Please vote with thumbs up or thumbs down. Curious what this group collectively believes.
definitely $400 cometh yo way . $200 by mid year and then off it goes to the races. By year end see it at $400 or perhaps more. Thanko
"Can you imagine back in 1980 when apple stock went public at 22.00, putting 50,000.00 into the stock and keeping it there for 41 years? I could not even dream of what that would be worth today. A few million i would think."
if this doesn't start recovering here soon. The morning may be worse.
The entire float is shorted. I think AAPL will increase the divy with good ER and we will see a short squeeze moving the SP closer to $150 by March
"I have 4,800 shares @ 37.00.Tomorrow AM I am selling and paying the taxes.AAPL is now uninvestable."
Oh my God Netflix up 10% after hours. Beat all benchmarks. Very positive affect on the market in general and the technology sector in particular tomorrow

UPGRADE Jan 19. 2021: RBC Captital Upgrades AAPL $145 both near term and Long term. Bullish Good Luck.
Aapl will be up 20 by monday
"If anyone was wondering what a single share of apple would be be worth had it not split. The answer is $28,672 at a current price of $128. A pretty remarkable investment. Investors should be reminded the Apple story is not over. Keep the faith."
Been out wakeboaridng all morning to come back and see apple trying to do something. wont happen guys...market is capped out.
Looks like America is back on the path to become one giant Detroit City.
Load up
Correction isn’t here yet it’s just a pull back
"This monster is the biggest cash cow I've ever seen. There's no stopping AAPL at this point, its just too massive and Tim Cook will drive this above and beyond everyones expectations."
Crushed it. It will be reflected in price of stock sooner or later.
It's results like this after a record earnings report that turns investors off. Then Wall Street wonders why GameSpot happens. I say turn the bulls loose tomorrow on AAPL. Who's with me. Big move up tomorrow!!!
"It is trying to break 145 AH and it will, just patience as you enjoy watching it."
Who else loves Luca Maestri’s italian accent? I’m looking forward to every earning’s report to hear his talk. Apple long!
"I’m guessing most of you are holding permanently/long term.But if not, what’s your exit point?I’ve been holding for over 4 years at split adjusted basis of ~$37.I think it’ll be $150-$160 after a good earnings call (if not sooner).There’s only one I’d roll it into if I sold - MO/Altria because the yield is a very tempting and safe 8% and I was starting to think Apple losing steam in a very overheated market.GLTA."
I just bought after hours. Co-workers told me about AAPL beating earnings . I agree with them AAPL will break 150 tomorrow or Monday. Tomorrow I will buy at the opening if i see any pullback. I want to accumulate more if drops. Electric car will send quickly than tesla. Price will surpass 200 breakout quickly. Price will correct soon due to revenues as of today.
Futures are lower but they will turnaround as soon as the market opens
Day traders over at GameStop and amc will cash in and invest in  Apple. Robinhood and interactive brokers just put restrictions on trades
"$135 tomorrow and we are in good shape. Tomorrow is key, can’t give up what we got today. Let’s go!"
"Looks like it’s up to Facebook, Tesla and Apple to save this market."
Get in on the AMC short squeeze! Look at it run. Going much higher!
"Given that earnings report, no one would had thought AAPl would be down 10% rather than up 10% .That's the markets. You can never expect the irrational to act rational"
Knowing how it trades in the final hour...lucky if it holds green.
Let’s go to $160
"It’s a tough market...or it’s a manipulated market, one or the other. Either way, AAPL longs will get their just reward"
Look at that jump before 8pm
Just recommended Apple on Wallstreetbets.
Market opened higher Apple is down but the day just started by end of the day it will be sharply higher. Anybody who thinks Apple is not a strong buy must either be from a different planet or a person with no balance and a financial thought process .
"Serious profit taking today on increasing volume. Won’t last long, you’ll see"
This guy says this is the best time to dump aapl after record earnings and a sudden 5% dropfor no reason.
Thanks for the shares at 136!!
HUGE BEAT FOR MSFT. $3 BILLION REVENUE BEAT
"Investors are trying to scoop up cheap prices. They’re looking for weak hands. Just watch the last trading hour, feeding frenzy."
Morgan Stanley 164.0p upgraded it
"What's wild to me is that people that can't even spell, or use punctuation correctly, think their assessment of current market conditions and AAPL's financial well-being is anything remotely worth listening to. If you're looking for answers... read through the literature your broker provides."
"Price action....are the gains going to hold today, give some back during the session or rally and close at all time highs?"
"Apple strong momentum until end of 2021. Situation same and the world digitisation process is speed up.. Apple will win in 5G, wearables and services... a sure winner"
"Apple’s (AAPL) stock fell after CEO Tim Cook said during the company’s earnings call that he expected a second-quarter deceleration in wearables and services sales growth, overshadowing fiscal first-quarter revenue and earnings that topped expectations. WTH?"
We are the Champions.
Buy on open!
"Apple is a hold and accumulate, not a trading stock."
Apple says Xmas sales are higher then any other years combined.
THIS'S ONLY BREAK THE BIG CRASH WILL COME I PREDICTED DOW DROP TO 10.000
Aapl gets rid of Parler and the stock is exploding upwards!!
If you're a true American and you love this country and your freedom....You'll sell your stocks now and go into cash....get out of the way of the dictatorship that's coming.
bought the dip and it's already profit :))
"You don't buy Apple stock because you like their products. You don't buy Apple stock because you like or dislike their political views.You buy Apple because you want to ""make money"".....it's that simple."
MSFT reporting day before AAPL along with FB reporting the same day as Apple could create a magnificent psychological synergy that will invigorate the price action post earnings maybe into next week. Could AAPL be having an 8 day winning streak like TSLA?
"I think I know why Money Managers that do not act as a Fiduciary, would want you to ride your investments down like the Titanic as a Panic Correction Strategy and then just wait it out and give them time to come back ?Technically they could short their Clients Investments all the way to the bottom and then return the shares to you on the turn around day, while they Reinvest the profits long that they made off your shares ?Now that’s some Wild Wild West xxxx but it’s very likely exactly what happens.Thats some panic correction strategy ?What do you call that, the some day I’ll break even plan ?The Truth is a Panic Correction is like finding Gold in your back yard and if you can’t profit from that, you likely shouldn’t be in the stock market at all ?You should look forward to Panic Corrections not Fear them !Buyer Beware !"
Bring on the buy backs!
140. I saw it
"As an employee at AAPL, we get to use up to 10% of our base salary to buy company shares at 15% discount of price since July 2020. That is a approximately 50% gains ;)"
New stimulus package fails to provide confidence and virus mutation imposing travel bans around the world. I personally have a hard time being bullish in this kind of overall mood.
Just in case if y'all wondering where is the next level?
Hit $150 after earnings we will.
Those February 19th $130-$135 Calls will be worth a great deal more if AAPL Runs to $140-$150 after January earnings. 
There was a time when earnings meant something
Yeah I’m definitely out from appl when market opens
how is this any good if apple stuffed the channel with iphones...not they have to work thru this inventory...and no guidance...smart mangement
"I bought it back at 135, I thought was a good price. It looks like I am wrong. Might have to wait a bit now. Long and strong"
Scary sign for the overall market that they're flat after a blowout. Check out $SKT as a top 10 short interest play.
Maybe an announcement tonight?
ms katy huberty upper her pt to 152 from 144... earnings will beat so we should see 150 after earnings.
140 tomorrow!!!
"The trend is up this week, we’ll have to see how high its going to go because it will effect the price after earnings!"
"Apple Fun Fact: At the beginning of the 6+ SuperCycle, Apple stock was at about $400 per share. Split adjusted, Apple stock is $4,000 per share today........3 months into the 12 Phone SuperCycle. Apple has been very good for the Longs, and very Cruel for the Shorts. Tim Cook has been Apple’s CEO the entire time. Apple is 3 months into the second 2 year SuperCycle........$200 per share is not just doable, it’s probable."
In the next 4 years Apple will be in the Robo Taxi business. That alone justifies a $4T market cap.
"Guys Apple always saves the market. It did in 2018, 2019, and 2020, for the last three years, when everyone thinks the market was going to crush. And now, it will do it again. No need to worry. Apple is a long-term investment for sure."
$145 tom?
I think earnings were already baked into the recent climb. I think if they didn't beat projections it would have been ugly. Now we can continue our strong steady climb to 200. I got no problem with that.
"The last three earnings releases we have seen the SP increase 10 days after earnings, November we saw $10, July we saw $19 and April we saw $4. I have a feeling we will se 160-170 in 15 days."
I now hold 2600 shares. Yesssss!
"$150 coming folks!! Adding to my position, holding for the next 10 years!!!"
Go Apple!!!
"All the millennial stocks are up, up, up. I think they think, ""Hey I use Apple, Gamestop, and Nike and I have a wish for solar power and Tesla,"" and they buy those stocks. It'll be interesting to see if buying what they know, love, and want translate to future earnings or if it'll be a 1999 lesson."
"When a stock goes from $108 to $142 in 2 months, u can’t be surprised when it sells off a little. That was a huge run up. Don’t worry"
$137. And we still have 3 full trading days till earnings
"Told you earlier to purchase Apple at 140 now it's going green and on its way to 150+, I tried to tell you twice!"
very confused by this drop from 143 to 133 after those earnings.. have investors completely lost their minds? I wish I had a fortune to move over into this right now. My other holdings are strong and I don't want to sell but this discount is making it extremely tempting.
Apple  could pull a GameStop
We’re not in a bubble?
"Just bought more Apple but also bought more Fidelity Blue Chip Growth with Apple as a major holding, Fidelity Semiconductors with Nvidia as a major holding, Fidelity Growth Company (closed to new investors? But they redirect you to other compatible Fund). God be my witness I lead a no stress or less stress life in terms of my portfolio and investment life"
"I love Apple. But I swear, if they change the keyboard on the new Macbook Air again..."
"If Microsoft is up $15 on a strong beat of 3 billion, Apple is going up $20! Let’s go!!"
Deal with it! It’s going higher next week! Buy Buy Buy!
Remember that there was only 2 months of 12 phone sales in Q1.
This is the ultimate buying opportunity to make some money before you miss the boat
"Thank u Apple, Amazon and the many other companies protecting the United State citizens from extremist violence."
I don’t care what it does! I will hold until the next split like I have all the other splits!
Wait till you see Apple's mono cell battery.
Time to get to work lads!
After these numbers can’t wait to add to my position tomorrow. Need to act in the morning because will be green by end of day.
Good day today! Long and patient.
"Why would anyone sell when Apple Beat In every segment , its an illusion in judgement , Buy apple on any pullback hold forever ."
"News reports suggest that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 family of devices sold far better than expected in China during the fourth quarter, providing further evidence that the long-predicted ""super cycle"" may have arrived. A story from DigiTimes (courtesy of MacRumors) reports that Apple sold north of 18 million iPhones during Q4, a ""staggering"" number which would suggest that Apple took more than 20% market share to close out the year."
I have over 2300 apple shares and it hurts to see it go down but I am glad my cost basis is $88. this stock is undervalued for what it reports
It’ll be a great quarter even though expectations are high
Mr. Market is just in a bad mood. He’ll cheer up soon.
big green day for today wait
Going green at the open! Follow the smart money and you will prosper
AAPL will see 144 today
OUCH STOP THE BLEEDING ALREADY. ENOUGH.
This can see 160+ in no time. Managed to hold today which is a good sign going into ER.
Apple Stock Approaches Record High as Street Anticipates Earnings Blowout
"Bought the dip at 137.75, AH ....you kidding me? Big beat, best necessary company in the world! Too easy..."
"I’m rich now, like you Thanks for all the moral support to holdLove you all !"
Apple trading today hasn’t even exceeded average daily volume!
Algorithim players move today?AAPL has dipped six times to $126+. So i do not expect a new trend to start.AAPL has yet to print $131intra day low or $132 as intra day highI think a move to $130+ is very possibleToday is Friday. Premium on weekly options is at a five day low.
$AAPL $500 by end of the year and then split
I think today is our last chance to buy more. We wont be seeing this again for a while.
Hope it goes 135 tomorrow...
it is very frustrating to watch a stock take months to move to all time highs but the hedge fund managers can take it down and wipe out months of gains in two days. the downward movements are violent in this rigged market.
Whoever is selling will regret it big time come Wednesday
apple needs to do a major acquisition this year and do a reverse split back to 4.3 billion shares outstanding. I will email Tim cook asap.
Apple to $225 forecasts Wedbush..
Wall St is so manipulated. Great company with record quarter goes down while GameStop skyrockets for no reason
I think we end up 2021 with Apple between $175-$200.
I can hold my apple stock until the end of the world if I have to ! I just think people should take this opportunity! Before it goes away ! Buy low sell high kids ! Business 101
"of this is such a good stock why is it below what it was last August. Buy other stocks beyond Meat, rad, sirli Rd are even better, get has nearly doubled in 6 months. This stock needs to spread the wealth"
"What will you do when the market really take a bear ride? This is just a down day for now. Butwhen the bears take over and it drops 8,000+ points will your emotions stand the test of time."
Let’s go up. Come on!
In Apple we trust. Rally into earnings.
Bought 1000 at $127. Holding for a few years
Still tanking AH
Y’all should’ve bought in today Apple so cheap. Watch it the up coming weeks due to earnings 
Options expire tomorrow.
"Apple was up for almost a week, the stock observed the earning profits already."
I think we ate about to see some break out iPhone numbers from Apple - it’s gonna be HUGE!!! See you at 180 real soon .If they continue to buy back shares we could see 300 in 2022-23 easy peasy .
Can someone explain the earnings report situation to me? Sry still very new to investing.Some people are saying it will dip back down and other are saying it will skyrocket. I'm confused
Hedge funds were/are selling AAPL/AMZN/MSFT etc to cover losses . Wait until they BUY backBUY all dips
Things that confuse me:1. Apple shorts2. Yahoo deleting my posts that don’t agree with their preferred narrative.
Muting (MASA) was the best trade of the day!
45 minutes til 1! et. then up up and away!!!
I know it’s old fashioned to mention PE ratios but look at the PE of AAPL. It’s pretty high compared to its historical average. Not giving any future guidance yesterday was a mistake and hence the stock is down
"for those tha feel the impending correction of tesla in the immediate future, I'm not here to bash tesla, love the company, have the utmost respect for musk especially in the direction he has been able to push forward in. What I am here for is to explain what is going on with valuation. anyone saying tesla will go to 20k is just ignorant. I know tesla doesnt trade on fundamentals, but think about this for a moment. tesla has been the most shorted stock ever. when they hit the sp500, bigger funds begin to buy in, making those that recently have been short, unable to continue and have been forced to buy back the stock at a loss (increased price). this will not last much longer. eventually you will have some big time shorts (currently just micheal Burrell) come in and this will fall hard. it will get back up but do you want to risk that much depreciation? look at the numbers. you should invest where you can make 100 to 400% over a year. can you look at Teslas market cap and really believe all the big hedge funds that are now buying in are going to hold when it reaches 30 or more % than what it is now? and how hard do youthink this will fall? I've been investing in spacs for less than a year, what do I know right? I do have a portfolio that has gained 756%. and they arent sitting in overvalued positions. they are reinvested into companies with the potential for 3 to 400% returns for the year. currently my latest position was in hcac warrants (hcacw) I bought them at 1.8. also. bought more at 3.5. they are at 4.7. now they already merged with canoo, and will likely get to 10 to 15 in the near future. everyone should have seen by now hyundais surge, nearly 20 billion added to market cap just on the rumor that they are in talks with apple. heres the fun part. canoo is doing the engineering services for hyundai's ev sector. they have designed their new skateboard platform for them, they have their own as well and will be a disruptor in the market in so many ways but just think about this, #AAPL has talked about their monocell as superior battery tech. they are now talking with hyundai. musk has said that monocells are ""impossible"" and canoo tweeted the new year in with ready to keep engineering the 'impossible' in 2021 as if to give musk a heads up. then of course left with this:just read between the lines, but the rumor and sell on the news. I'm not here to pump, I'm here to help those that have a gut feeling right now listen to it. it's made me 756% for 2020 and I'm already up another 60% since then. canoo is #GOEV. warrants are #GOEVW. roll your profits over and gain another big run. them when tesla has had its correction we can be ready to jump back in again.."
$200 by July.
"for all those who are wondering why this is happening. the big players have to cover their losses, which they got from what is happening over at gamestop and co. that is why they have to sell the best they have. its actually an opportunity for smaller investors to get apple for a bargain."
"Alright people, here it is:Monday: close 145$Tuesday: close 153$ Wednesday: close 160$Thursday (earnings boost): close 175$ or moreThe predictions have been shared, mark this post!"

"For everyone who is selling shares in a form of protest I don’t think the investing world is a good place for you. You’ll be hard pressed to find a company this size with 100% moral integrity. You’re better off holding your shares, making money, and donating to a cause you are passionate about."
Gene Munster says he is surprised stock not moving higher on report and outlook.
WHY DOWN if earnings beat the expectations ????Can somebody explain that to me PLEASE ?Thanks
This is Apple relax.
Call coming up. Watch for a flow of green
Mistakes I've made: Married young. Peeing on electric fence. Selling Apple.
I did a call option on apple and made some money. I plan on doing another one on monday morning.
150 after earning who agrees with me on this. Super positive and bullish on it.
"Yeah Baby, Lets see this puppy close above 139 today.......WoooHooooo"
If Apple could pull in $110 billion this on Jan 27th earning report or about $6.47 p/shr. share price could hit $160.
"In my gut... AAPL will ""shock"" to the upside with R, E and Outlook..."
"please, does anyone know ex-dividend date. can't find it"
"Did you know there’s no real outbreak of COVID in China? I hear the new saying is “Come do business in China, CoronaVirus free”, CEO of Moderna stated that Covid is with us forever. If that is the case and China can continue to effectively contain it, how does this effect their economy and society over 5-10 or say even the long term effects over 50-100 years?"
"if stock market goes down, the government will give away more money. how can you lose buying Apple stock?"
"Guess its easy being a SH for 10+ years, but people need to look at the big picture. Huge run up the last two years. At some point it has to cool off. The quarter was fantastic, bodes well for the future, just have to do what has worked for a decade...give it time. Short term the market isnt rational. Never has been, never will, but long term it is 100% rational."
Getting slammed with record holiday earnings is defly not a good sign...defly
"You can still make $8.00-$10.00 a share tomorrow, by buying this tonight. FYI."
Thank you for the cheap shares!!!
"WHAT STRENGHT, 150$ next week here we go ladies and gents, the apple show"
"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note published shortly after reports about the Hyundai discussions first broke, “We believe Apple is in the early stages of talks and looking at a handful of strategic partnerships and collaborations globally with existing auto makers on the [electric vehicle] front, with Hyundai on the radar.""He added that electric cars are ""what could ultimately be a trillion dollar opportunity globally over the next decade.""""It's a smart strategic move for Apple to dive into the deep end of the pool on this new age of [electric] vehicles,"" Ives said."
Apple  a day takes the mortgage away
Relax. Its just the big institutions trying to get your shares!
how big is $100 billion quarter?
"Not sure what Cramer had to say about AAPL here that caused this thing to crash, but the fact of the matter is that nothing fundamentally changed. AAPL is still expecting a blowout earnings report and every one is raising their price targets for AAPL. This still has the potential to hit $160 by the end of the week."
"This Friday, Apple $167. Buy now or going up n up starting tomorrow. Bye bye Low prices"
Holding long! Happy new year longs. Don’t let today bother you. 2021 will be huge.
T mobile up 70%. Phone sales 1.6M last quarter. Mainly iPhones.
CONGRATS IN ADVANCE if you are accumulating those FEBRUARY $130-$135 CALLS ON DISCOUNT BEFORE EARNINGS. 
Don't understand how the whole market can dump 25% in the span of 10 minutes. How is it even possible to coordinate that?
speechless!!
"the old adage was diversification on wall street. all you need is one winning small cap like Tesla and your lifestyle has changed forever, after investing 1 year in it. Tesla has made amateur investors smarter than professionals, with the obvious wealth it created to the masses. Tesla up 11 days in a row, up another 40 points pre market. a broken slot machine that pays off every day. elon musk now over 210 billion dollars. Hyundai up 19 % today on the apple announcement. what is apple up. sell all apple and buy Tesla at any price. going to 2500 in 3 years or less, 12500 pre split."
Does anyone know what time Apple reports earnings tomorrow?
This could go down as low as $133 in the next week. Will recover and set new high at $152 by late february
"New records, so the price drops by 3%. Geesh. I wish I knew what people wanted to see."
PLUS AAPL will be buying back more stock next week.
Here comes the train to $145. All aboard the green apple train
Remarkable this is actually sitting here down a few dollars. I think wall st is still trying to comprehend these incredible earnings and numbers. All this before they start buying again in massive chunks. Add more folks.
5 days Nasdaq up 300 pointAapl up 50 cents...we need a $10 up day...badly
"The start of the week might be not move much, but I guarantee you it will move up by the end of the week. People wont risk not being able to get in before earnings week!! I see some shorts getting squeezed out this week. Go MAGA!!(Make Apple Great Again)"
"iPhone 12 Sales Soar in China to Close Out 2020The strong demand is expected to continue through Lunar New Year, which bodes well for Apple investors. Apple sold north of 18 million iPhones during Q4, a ""staggering"" number which would suggest that Apple took more than 20% market share to close out the year. A combination of pent up demand and a host of 5G models are likely driving the iPhone's robust sales. The momentum is expected to continue through China's Lunar New Year holiday on Feb. 12, which would give Apple another quarter of ""staggering"" sales similar to Q4."
Greatest earnings beat of all time BOAT and it may plummet to double digits...
alway believed good news delivered before market opens and bad news after the market is closed.So why is Apple delivering news after market close ?
"Called it, yesterday, Apple STILL falling off cliff. Ta daaaaaah!"
"So, how long until AAPL is a $4 Trillion dollar company? 2 years maybe? People will be wishing that they bought when this was only $140"
"People don't understand why the new iPhone 12 pro is never before seen levels of utility. 12 pros have a lidar built in, allowing extremely accurate bokeh, autofocusing in a tenth the speed of Samsung, enables full ar gaming and productive apps, and more. aka apple glasses."
"It will be a delayed upside, once the GME, AME and others settles down. But I support crushing short's of hedge funders. They've been running the show forever and thumbing their noses on retail investors. No hate messages only gloating. Lol"
"Lets counter the shorts, hedge funds and after hour traders. Don’t sell. Do like they did with GME and make a social group on Reddit. « Financial Power to the people thanks to social média »."
"Last thing I heard Apple management & BOD worked for the stockholders. Yet Tim Cook is quite free with our money for his political causes. $100,000,000 is Apples latest give-a-way & it comes out of our pockets. Sure Apple makes a lot of money and management already rewards themselves with hundreds of millions in stock bonuses. Yet they feel the company should donate to Tim Cook's political causes rather than have him donate his own money. Tim does an excellent job but he should EITHER get his bonus or use HIS bonus to donate to liberal causes IMO."
hopefully apple and tesla will shine and pull the market out of this tailspin. if all the earnings AH are great then the dow will be up 500 tomorrow.
"Apple forward PE around 28 which isn’t bad considering 5G supercycle, own chips in computers, services booming, eventual car, and wearables booming with VR AR glasses on the way."
"AAPL is arguably the safest, valuable stock on the market. No need to panic over this."
"By wash trading enough shares to lock AAPL price below 140 through opex tomorrow, those institutions are violating the Commodity Exchange Act, of 1936."
Who thinks Apple will touch. 150 before it hits 110￼. Again?
Hopefully next earnings they lose a billion so this goes up
"Apple is a liberal company and will always be. Apple alone has made me a millionaire and where I will always vote for conservatism over socialism, I plan to hold onto my shares. Apple disguises themselves as a liberal company, but we all know they are the most dominate capitalist company of all time. We also know that they market their products to people with money. They only have 15% of the cell phone market in the world, but 85% of the profits. Their market cap is 6% of the entire world economy. Wrap your head around those facts! Yes, I voted for Trump as he is pro business and capitalism and I had a 40% annual return over 4 years. I can guarantee we will never see a stock market run again like the last 4 years. However, I feel like Apple can continue to do 20% plus annually over the next few years with the 5G super cycle."
who thinks 140+ before earnings then 160+ after?
Omg whats happening ?
https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/
"Hang Seng was up 900+, what's up with that?"
140.50 at closing
"Apple is just not the same, can't even hold during Premarket... Hopefully we can get $3 in AH/premarket, I doubt it though."
This is nothing but a minor blimp in the long term scheme of things.
"Apple: earns 1 billion per day, investors: let's sell"
Thanks to GME the big guys have decided to hammer us on AAPL despite 100+ billion quarter
"It is announced today that Apple’s hardware engineering chief will step down to oversee a “NEW PROJECT”, he will report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Bringing his successful formula from the iPhone and iPad to a NEW APPLE PROJECT is a good thing."
why today dow drops . when apple to report
Earnings will be huge
"111 BILLIONS LAST QUARTER, INCREASED DIVIDENDS. BUY THE DIPS. WILL CLOSE POSITIVE"
"iPhone maker Apple on Wednesday reported App Store sales of $1.8 billion for the recently concluded holiday season with New Year's Day accounting for 30% of the spending.Cramer said Apple's statements that came out this morning indicate they are going to have very strong service revenues. ""Apple is a buy because it's down right now and it has customers. Themes like work from anywhere, digitization and healthcare make me want to buy Apple even more.”"
Does anyone know why Apple would be down after good news from their earnings call this evening?...
Everyone that bought in above or close enough to current share price is selling off in hopes they can tag in at a lower price in the next hour which won’t happen & shorts just fueling trash posts on here to close there positions. This will boom at some point today and we all are sitting back just waiting for it. GME can work wonders like that APPL is up next!. Close $155.00-165.00 
Don’t let Tesla and Facebook scare you
Something seriously wrong with this picture. We have the following :https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/2021012715206/apples-iphone-12-helped-deliver-a-record-1114-billion-quarter-2nd-updateAnd yet it drops almost $5.00 after hours.
Get ready for take off! 
"Or, do you expect AAPL to go up another 7X in the next 8eight years and be a 16 trillion Co."
"Goody Morning Ladies (and guys too). The office next door where the shorts and day traders lodge ain't sayin much today. I being kind hearted said to them ""fellas yo want me to get yo some donuts"". May be little bit sugar will make them jumpy and they will then decide to coverth their short positions. Because frankly, surely, dearly the margin call cometh soon so need to cover yo short positions. Thanko"
That BOOM you just heard is Apple stock breaking Mach 1 !
Worst company to invest .. it’s give all good things but share price always remain down
for all who are selling their shares due to apple's decisions regarding parlor or any other media platform. go ahead and sell your shares . the insignificant amount of shares you have will make no difference to a company who has 17 billion shares outstanding and 2.3 trillion market cap. basing your investment decisions on emotions and not DD you will lose everytime.
Mark my words - we’ll be over 144 on Monday 
Steak and lobster dinner tonight.
Bought a bunch of March calls today . I see Apple in the 150s by then
You clowns need to lookout 3-5 years. I’m long! Set it and forget it. Go trade something else. Apple is a long term play. I’ll keep accumulating shares until the next split and have 6 figure profits!!
"Blowout quarter and NOTHING for the shareholders but decreased value. Nothing criminal here, keep it moving"
Got strong volume...Breakout could be happening! Good Luck
"This will close $130 today, then $134 end of weekand then pop around $140 to $140-$144 around and after earnings.Thumbs up if you agree."
This is absolutely disturbing. 12 billions revenue better than last year the price keep on dropping. I guess we all should have sold it when it hit all time high. Shorting just never learned. They already billions of dollars shorting GME. I am out of here. Hold it for more than 4 months. Did not get a dime.
Bought more this morning and already up two bucks early retirement here I come!
"@tanya look at Tesla and FB now, they are green"

Great opportunity To add calls on apple 
Great time to buy more
"Looks like the Tesla, Apple & Amazon shares of my primary portfolio is going to give another impressive return for this year as well. In 2020, I made a little over $900K with my portfolio. January 2021 is not even over yet and I've already made $192K already. I guess KARMA is just rewarding me for the decade of my life which I spent back in the early 2000s working like a dog (while being really sick) in order to put my now ex-wife through med-school. She then decided to pay me back by running off after she graduated & found a job in 2011..."
bout time it went green......'
I don’t mind that’s it’s down after hours. I get to buy more cheaper now lol
Monday February 1st HUGE rebound. This just end month selling
"The open was what WE expected..IT gaped at open then Ran BUT!After the algorithim play AAPL dipped. THe day is not over.Once again, until now and 1/29 the field belongs to the investors.It is fair."
"they are killing options and hedge funds selling to cover losses on short positions,we will wait. stop selling......................."
Bought 500 stocks in March 2017 @ $35. Still wanna hold. I think not bad 
$15 drop in a few days after one of the best quarters. Yup stock market at its beat
JJ vaccine should be used for young no underlying conditions. Moderna Pfizer for older and those with underlying conditions. Crush the pandemic by April.
Today's Barron Article on Apple mentions upgrades to the stock while the Stock Price went down. Goes on to mention that maybe Reddit (WallStreetBets) should mention Apple. The funny thing is they did mention Apple today on there message board for today. Interesting!
"At the earnings call all Anlysists care about is IPhone. if the Iphone is up we going to fly, if not we will go down."
"The company reported $64.7 billion for the quarter, the best of the 2020 calendar year. Since then, however, the iPhone 12 has been released, and sales are surging. The company has announced in recent weeks that it plans to increase the production of the iPhone 12 by 20% to 30% to meet the increased demand for the iPhone line. For more hot stocks like (AAPL) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
"It is no brainier, $INTC should outsourcing $TSM. This has nothing to do with made in USA/patriotic/politics etc. It is about making more money. First $TSM business is to fabricate chips, Intel business is designing and fabricating its own chips. TSM is not interested in Intel design business and Intel can keep that to themselves to keep their business secrets but why Intel adding more cost to their chips by fabricating their own chips instead of outsourcing to TSM which can fabricate better and cost effectively. Intel should look at $AAPL and see why $AAPL outsourced their 5G chips to $TSM"
"AAPL  Up Up and away. What a beautiful day. Those who are long, celebrate. It’s going to be a beautiful ride."
Once AAPL hits the 150 and 160 target by analyst they will have to upgrade to 200 like Munster already did.
Is this a scam? Market looks strong but individual stocks are too much down. How come
It is maddening. Presumably the price before earnings took into account the earnings estimates. It is hard to find the logic in the stock price moving lower today after blow out profits which significantly beat those estimates. But Apple will continue it’s upward trend after the dust settles.
Oppenheimer increased its price target on Apple (AAPL) to $160 from $125 following better than expected Q1
"Making lemonade out of lemons.someone sold 100,000 Jan 22 $107.50 puts for $7.65 and $113.75 puts for $11.40They keep the money ( millions) or MUST but AAPL at $100 or $102"
"Will skyrocketing by Monday after all the calls expire today, look at the volume!"
earnings call then green
If you thought this was a good day for Apple WAIT TILL TOMORROW.....
"People who say that Apple is a ""safe investment"" are completely wrong. Their P/E ratio is 40+ and price to book ratio is around 36. They operate in a highly competitive industry and their products are prices well above competition. In most places, an apple gadget is considered a luxury good because there are many cheaper alternatives available. Safe investments are money market instruments."
AAPL has printed $144+ last two days as an intra day high.Maybe tomorrow?
"BREAKING NEWS ""APPLE MISSED ON REVENUE"""
MSFT coming up soon!
"Shares are going up because the new iphone 12 is incredible. I have upgraded every couple years and the 12 is the fastest, longest battery and incredible camera is incredible. I have buying aapl for years and have 6377 shares. Go fellow longs!"
Dow will drop 750-1000.People do not like or trust the market adter this.It happened in the 1980's and it took decades before another generation started buying stocks again.
Are we going to see a dollar increase today?
Many people are scared of the profit taking after earnings....with the last two days of flat consolidation (no huge gains)...I don't think many people will sell...with great earnings call...hoping it drives the price up
"Cramer caused this crash, cost aapl amd amzn stockholders millions"
if Apple price drops i am. buying more
Take my advice keep buying Apple . Will be double by Christmas 
AAPL is a great company. My original purchase was $25 pre split
"Earnings update in 10 days, then pop goes the sharp rice and guidance for the rest of the year. Very excited. This was my third spit and things are getting much more serious as a percentage of holdings."
"buy the dip 132-133There is 205,000 calls at 135 strike price, these will not pay out.Casino wants them to be 0"

what do we think? Up or down Monday?
Hubert MS raises Apple $8 to $152 sees basically blowout quarter
This better find green tomorrow. I don’t care what the options do or the markets.
Just two words .....FREE SPEECH.

"As just posted, new intra day highs follow double digit ""V"" action"
Absolute blowout....1.67 eps is just unbelievable....there are really no words...Tim Cook is awesome!
Is AAPL finally going to make its run??
Once the focus is back on the fundamentals this is going to resume flying again. Won't be long.
why would anyone sell at bottom
"Makes sense AAPL with blowout earnings drops, companies with huge losses gain. I guess this the bizzaro world."
Don’t sell! Buy and sell if it goes up to average down :)

"I’m listening to this conference call right now. All sounds amazing, but stock not moving ..."
Got my money in Apple and BCAP let’s get this bread
If breaks $140 then nothing can stop AAPL to $160 at Earning Report day. IMHO
What happened at 11:08 is why you don’t trade Apple  or try and time it! You will get burned. Unless you have cash on the sidelines to buy more. That was scary for traders not longs. Can’t wait for Wednesday
Quarter earnings for the holiday season/new products announcement in Sept is always the highest than the rest of the other 3 quarters with the exception of when AAPL supercycle. So if you believe AAPL is in a supercycle then decide how to invest.
"$4 dollars is a hard stay. Hoping this closes up $8 and continues through next week until earningsWE ARE MAKING UP FOR WHAT WE LOSS, then earnings."
"Back from the nap lads, what’d I miss......look at after hours price are you kidding me. Looks like we’re riding this into next week. Unstoppable."
This market is on the edge. Bad timing for Apple.
Mark it 145 by Wendsday earnings Wendsday after close pop 18-22 168 by Friday maybe 170
Apples  time to pull a Tesla and breakout. Hold on Tightttt
Just another opportunity to buy while you can.
Many people says this company is overvalued that is over valued.. but they do not understand.. all those small companies not listed in the exchange shut down.. and all the money is flowing to those that are still strong.. they became even bigger monopolies..

"Wow, I can’t believe he didn’t pardon all the great patriots that stormed the Capital."
It's funny watching the wannabe day traders.
I will buy more if pulldown. 200 is coming in Q1..patience
I made the mistake of selling after a earnings dip back in 2008. Not doing that again.
A bit dumbfounded as to the posts regarding lack of movement with Apple stock price. Return on stock price in 2020 was roughly 80%. 2019 was 90%. Good enough for us longs.
easy 170$ ...come one apple ...
Both AAPL and MSFT posted awesome results
aapl is going to take off soon
"buy it, buy it  in a month it will be 155-160 $ "
January 27th for earnings. Its going to blow away analysts eps estimates. Buybacks and huge jump in free cash flow.
"Every one keep in mind that after hours consists of a few hundred thousands shares traded in total. Regular trading day with AAPL alone is in the tens of millions of shares. So rest assured that tomorrow AAPL will not disappoint, it will be up and continue its ascent to much higher levels in days months and years to come. Stay long and prosper. "

142 to 137 after hours–on a 111.4 BILLION BEAT?!! This is criminal.I'm selling all my shares of AAPL and buying GameStop in the morning. (insane).
Patience fellow longs. Next week we will see this return to where it should be.
"After spending an entire week going back and reviewing about 25 years of Apple's financial statements from the 1990s through 2020, all I can say is WOW. Never ever bet against it underestimate Apple. Apple is the home of iPod, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Airpods...and the soon to be announced Apple Glasses and Car.... all those under one roof... And so many other products that have become significant in American culture. Without a doubt, own it don't trade it."
Margaret the dividend is 0.205
"Great trading stock in the last few months. As long term investment not really. From the stock split 5 months ago goes slow, I really don't know who is happy with this. I bought on 127 two weeks ago and sold on 143, 10 days later. Same today, will buy on 130-131 and sell on 150 in 2-3 weeks. Easy money. Just patience."
Your all awesome 
Wake me when we get to 200
"Should Apple drop after earnings, I will be in line to buy more. Anyone else?"
"RSI is almost 75. Support is around 126. Its about time institutions set the hook and reel this baby back in to the 120's, maybe lower."
"The months' long mayhem of destruction and death caused by Democrats continues in places like Portland, Oregon but since they are party members , Democrats and the FBI are cool with it."
I think Hedge funds have sold AAPL short. AAPL can spike anytime to cover position. Very risky and dangerous these days to play short sale. All the numbers are obvious and leaks from the institutions not very difficult to ignite the buyers an players. There are big players behind this game. It cannot be possible without the involvement of big players
The earning can’t be better than ever. 2t valuation company growing 20% YOY. What else do you want?
Do you think it will dip again? or buy more now?
"Jump on the bandwagon, AAPL is going higher...Goldman and the biggest holders are all prepping for the “surprise” rally."
Huge Sell Off next week and in coming days Aapl 100$ after earning

This little sell off is a gift! Gobbling up shares at these levels for a quick jump back to the 140's.
"Does anyone know, or can confirm, that APPL is working on VR glasses?"
why in red ?
"Another beat! So predictable. Really, why do I bother with any other equities?"
"I can't imagine selling AAPL or MSFT after their positive reports. Whatever happens tomorrow, I'm guessing they will both be higher in 3 months. Obviously, I'm a buy and hold type."
Predictions of Apple and$100 Billion in Iphones delivered - wow - this stock will be jumping most of the day and fly after earnings announced tonight
"The high-end innovative consumer technology in Apple’s roadmap, including its VR headset, is like no other, one-of-a-kind, and impossible to reproduce from competition without heavy investment. Even if it could be copied, it’s all carefully patent-protected. This deserves AAPL a much higher multiple"
"I don't who massively sold their position yesterday, but it's time to add up"
"I don't make price predictions, but I will make this prediction: if you are trading based on emotion, you are going to lose. And the greater emotion plays into your trading decisions, to more you are going to lose.If you want to make money in this game, you better be thinking and not feeling."

I put tow hundred fifty thousand dollars in Apple  at 121.a shear and I going to let it ride for two years I think it a great deal at this price .So this is what I would do if I was you it going to start going up and before you know it will at 175 a shear and still going up good luck
"""A number of equities research analysts recently weighed in on the stock. Wedbush boosted their price objective on shares of Apple from $150.00 to $160.00 and gave the company an “outperform” rating in a research report on Wednesday, December 9th. Needham & Company LLC reiterated a “buy” rating and set a $140.00 price target on shares of Apple in a research report on Wednesday""...Might hit these numbers at the end of this month with record breaking earnings!!"

Whoever got options. You guys selling if it pops past $138 before earnings. Or taking the risk of holding it after
This is about the same timeframe the breakout occurred after the 2014 stock split...history repeating
"GME pumpers are not just stealing from hedge funds, they are stealing from us(and themselves if they own Apple)."
"Listen up, if we band together and start buying AAPL, we can turn it into another AMC or GME. Let's have a Yahoo's revolt on the shorties! Let's do it!"
Best quarter in history...dips...american ailrines good qaurter pops 27 percent...
Apple to hit 200 by match
"Apple executive management was acting against company and investor interests when they allowed their political bias to affect their decision regarding removing Parler from the Apple iPhone Apps. If the stock price drops as a result, there will be a flood of lawsuits by investors who see their investments lose value."
Absolutely Fantastic!!!
"If you want to know about God and what to expect, find out what the Hindu’s believe ?They are the only ones not claiming to be a Religion and they seem to have the best information ?I met God 30 years ago as a non practicing Catholic/ born again Atheist but the experience mirrored Hindu Beliefs ?I was above my body looking down with a singular sight !The Eye !I met God as Thought without a Body!I did not see God, I felt her love!I couldn’t hear God but understood perfectly !I asked what was next and saw the silhouette of a pregnant woman with a glowing fetus inside !It was the most amazing display of Telepathy that you could ever hope to witness !If you meet God as an Atheist like I did, you have no idea just how surprised your going to be but I do !Nobody is prepared for what happens, not even the Hindu’s !Your supposed to be surprised and God does not disappoint !Thanks  Mom !"
Why stop at a $100 Billion quarter y’all? Why not $200 Billion in 5 years or less?
Last july results +40$Buy before its too late
"Company Pegatron Corp leasing 500,000 sq ft to manufacture new iPhones for Apple . No shortage for phones"
Dips after every earnings release then with in a week always makes new high check the quarterly pattern on long term chart if you don't believe me.
don't people realize aapl is the best stock to own .why are we trading down? just on value alone should make the shares worth trading higher.250.00....
Not a big fan/user of all the over-priced Apple products... but I LOVE this stock. My Apple gains paid me more this year than my actual job. Thank you Apple
Don’t worry guys! Apple will finish green today! I have no doubt! You can print my comment! And keep it
"It will start moving up after this week calls expiration, look at the volume of calls expiring 29 Jan."
"Big money will not invest in tech companies embroiled in social engineering.It is as plain as that.Cook think because AAPL is so large, it is teflon."
"The vast majority of AAPL shares are quietly stashed away in the secure knowledge that they will be worth more with each year that passes. Apple is awash in cash, talent and ingenuity."
If you hold 5-10 years all this #$%$ will be over! Another place in history
AAPL will tank tomorrow. Big funds & huge investors need to have the market go down so they can get cheap shares. Looking for a 10% drop in the markets.
"Lol no body wants to let go of their shares and as soon as it starts to dip, people start buying more!"
IBM cometh out with great results. Just cometh out.
"Hilarious. Don’t care if we’re down. I’ve been in since 1999. Huge upside starting tomorrow. Best guess, and educated one, 165 in 2 weeks."
"Keep in mind folks Q4 earning won't go in vein, hang in there ! whole market was down today, it will be back in game soon !"
"Apple climbs steadily. It doesn’t do 10% gains in a day. Those of u calling for 160 by Wednesday are being far too optimistic. It will get there, just not Wednesday"
"Canaccord boosts Apple target to $150 from $145 on 'strong' iPhone demandCanaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley raised the firm's price target on Apple to $150 from $145 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. Apple continues to demonstrate the strength of its product ecosystem, Walkley tells investors in a research note. The analyst anticipates ongoing double-digit growth for Macs, iPads and services. He increased estimates for Apple ""with strong demand for the new iPhone 12 products."" iPhone sales in Q1 could reach double-digit growth despite a tough comparable, Walkley says. He believes Apple shares are ""compelling"" for long-term investors."
"this should be at $160 by now with the earning beat, not 139, sometime fundamental, common sense doesn't work."
"If this falls to $90, would anyone buy?"
This is pretty close to pre-split price. Don’t think it will go down much lower. Apple usually goes up for dividend payout. Should go up next week
Does anyone know why the market dropped soSuddenly late this morning? I didn’t really hear anything on the news
IF NASDAQ recovers tomorrow +200 then APPLE will see 150s! it depends on overall market.
Been a stockholder since 2010. I have a buy order in at $120. I love when things are on sale!
Relax this happens every single quarter don’t worry about it.... wait till wait till earnings are reported
Adding to Apple position tomorrow....these earnings just confirmed how undervalued Apple is
more AAPL stock buy back starts today
"Appl is now a very mature company, but is still being viewed by many as a start up. They’re doing great, but just shouldn’t be valued as they are. A mid 30s PE and a 250 PEG are just excessive. They can’t grow quickly enough to bring those ratios down to earth so the only alternative is to bring the stock price down. Appl should be sub $100."
Thank God I decided to wear underwear today!
"At its Q4 2020 call, Apple confirmed $64.7 billion in revenue, a record September quarter: Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2020 fourth quarter ended September 26, 2020. The Company posted record September quarter revenue of $64.7 billion and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $0.73.2 days ago￼iMore › apple-could-announce-...Apple could announce first-ever $100B quarter at January ... - iMore"
"I would not hold any stocks long or short for a couple of weeks until the short squeeze fest is over. I an neither long nor short at this time just 100% cash. I believe the market will see some heavy corrections as the hedge funs sell some of their winners I.E ""apple"" in order to cover their absurd losses in their short positions."
"An opinion and a question. I own 300 shares of AAPL that I bought at $115.00.....just to see if I could make a ""few bucks"" on it. I've been watching it for 3 or 4 months now and if dumped it today I'd pocket around 6K.With earnings coming out next week and all of the chatter about the stock going up I'm wondering if it would be smart to sell around 50 shares now (or before Wednesday) to pocket my gains, put an order in to sell it all at some given price...maybe 120 or 125 or just let it ride. The problem is that every time Apple announces earnings the stock goes up and THEN it takes a dive. This particular earnings report is somewhat special because of the new line of IPhones......but that doesn't happen every year. I like to have money in my hands...not just watch it on paper. The dividend from Apple is a joke.....unless you own enough. I have a lot of money invested in closed end funds that pay anywhere from 6 to 11 % and THAT'S where I make money. The .82 that AAPL pays is not exactly my cup of tea. I'm not in the ""market"" for the future......I'm in for right now.....I'm not a kid any more. ANY AND ALL comments would be greatly appreciated"
Apple is up very big over the last couple of years. Odds are you have big profits. Nothing wrong with taking some and planting a few seeds in the baby Apples of the world. Apple won’t go up 100% this year.......but lots of other stocks will go up 200% this year. Find a few. Build your wealth.
All bears are saying there is a market bubble all bulls are saying this will go to 300 within a year.Let’s be realistic here. Apple is a very safe investment for the long term and it will always be a great investment. Apple is adapting to the new market coming out with a ev car that will compete with Tesla and have a similar run.Apples financials are amazing and people will always be buying Apple for retirement and will be buying their new products in the future. Invest in the long term and you will be happy
People get so excited over a little correction in the market relax everyone it will all be fine .
Buffet is buying more.
"don't worry everyone, I just bought a couple of puts that expire tomorrow, so apple will close green tomorrow lol"
By Wednesday it will going to hit $150
"Let’s go Bulls let’s go! Up .69 cents today, I’ll take it, my favorite number and position!"
Now 6 more months of stagnation?
Apple  hasn’t hit bottom yet - it’s coming- be patient
"Seriously, how on earth should Apple fail tomorrow? iPhone 12 has huge demand, same applies for M1 devices. Since iPhone drives 50% of the overall earnings I'd expect great figures."
Apple delivered. Enough said. Don’t need to talk numbers.
There will be a flood of vaccines in the summer. Boosters for all strains in the fall. The roadmap to ending the pandemic is clear. The go outside economy will boom like never before as people are released from covid prison. Pent up demand is historic
Where are the half wits that said NOK was breaking out - 
48 percent capital gains taxes would be brutal and send market in a nose dive. . When will we know his exact tax policy
$150 next
sold 50%142.00
Got in big at $107-109. I’m so excited. 2307 shares
Set your sell limit orders to $2600 boys. So shorts can’t borrow your shares.
Bouncing back strong!
"Well boys I bet right this time. I even bet during nice 127 drop there. combined, my options position breaks even at 136 and takes profit at a 11 to 1 conversion. This means a 155 price this Thursday will net me 189% profit. And most of my options expire in March "
"Blow this day of trading up, see you all next week, no one buys on Fridays"
"Good Morning everyone Wanted to share another technical analysis with you all. Rsi and Stoch have bottomed out. Apple is having huge volume and the short squeeze is green. Meaning we will have upside here. Little bit of sideways trading but for earnings, we will target 145. Post earnings it will continue to fly. Don’t miss out the ride over pennies and buy cheap now. I bought 40k shares myself."
Big congrats Apple with historic earnings last night massive WIN let’s go fam 
"With earnings about a week away, I just wanted to share some thoughts...Firstly, about analyst expectations. Folks, if Apple reports massive revenue it's great for us don't get me wrong, but some analysts calling for $100 billion or more in revenue, that's kind of unrealistic. It's almost like they're setting up Apple to fail. What if Apple only reports $85 to $90 billion does that warrant a drop in the share price? And let's not forget Apple did not provide guidance for this quarter. So expectations are too unrealistic. We're still in the middle of a pandemic. We're not out of the woods yet. If Apple can perform as good as they did last year I'd be satisfied, but if they do even better then that then I'd be very pleased. Secondly, I believe the selling is way overdone. We should see the stock price climb with positive results and upcoming announcements. The stock held onto the support level very well technically. So I believe the stock has a lot more room to run. There's so many revenue channels that can leaf to more growth. The continued buybacks will help with any dips in the long run.Third, I mentioned this in the past but I don't believe Apple will comment about Project Titan since the deal is still being ironed out with manufacturers. So don't expect them to shed any light on their plans till later on. I know many are eagerly waiting for this but still.Fourth, when earnings are announced, pay very close attention to some of the sleeper hit revenue channels that aren't being focused on as much like Apple Fitness. I believe these areas will be key to leading us to more growth and higher revenue in the future. Definitely not priced in at this current price.Own it don't trade it! Apple long!"
No way MMS were going to let it close above $140 today. still excellent Friday close and on to ER week.
It’s sky rocketing ! Apple is going to be huge! $170 by Feb 11
I am so confused. Should I sell or stay?
A. Thru the roof Apple earnings this afternoon....B. Down day todayC. Apple up Thursday 10%. No brainer
social media has completely changed the dynamics of the market. you really dont know in which way your stocks could be targeted
I don't mind this hanging around this level for now. When earnings come it will explode possibly 10%....$140.00
This makes 0 sense
"Rod Hall UPGRADE! Haaaah! Remember, I called that a few weeks ago. Check my message history. No doubt another classic shakeout right before earnings as we've seen countless times so Goldman can load up on the shares for its clients before earnings. This is getting old folks... We've seen it done too many times. Apple long. Own it don't trade it."
I’ll be buying 
What are 10 of your current holdings? Here are mine -AAPLABRBACGBTCCCLGEVMSFTXAMZN
AAPL hit all time high of $140.36 after hours. Next stop is $150.
"Reminder: Apple is repurchasing roughly $20 billion per quarter or about 150 million shares at the current price. Go look at the capital return history on Apple's Investor Relations website. If anyone is upset or salty, please go ahead and sell your shares and/or short all the shares you can. Thank you. We stand ready to buy the dip."
I suggest you pick up a ton of LOTZ during this market disconnect. It’s a new IPO. They will be the size of Carvana in 3 years. You’re getting in on the ground floor now.
hedge funds probably shorted apple after selling a lot
"$AAPL will have a strong earnings report, if the stock goes up & up before Wednesday , it could be a less chance to go up after earnings, same apply to $FB"
Will break 160 on earning or fall back to 135?
"7% yield? Yes pls. I like how T took off when growth stocks collapsed yesterday......I believe in T’s cash generating potential (HBO, 5G) but also think it is a great natural hedge to the likely tech turbulence ahead (although I remain an $aapl and $qqq long......just part of a balanced diet and portfolio! I also like Michael Craft store as a short squeeze with 30% market cap short despite management reporting huge gains on top and bottom line....."
GME is done.. No hedge funds left to cover... Now it's time to move your earned $$$ into serious AAPL..
Wow 1.68 eps 111.4 billon great job everyone I hope you all did great
Down 10% after earnings is easy since retail sales were terrible in America over the hollidays
Bought some AAPL today. I think this will be $135 plus here pretty soon. Good luck all!
This stock is definitely controlled by wall street no doubt!!
"As announced yesterday this bear trap market, it is going to be a slaughter for shorts..."
"I bought At 137.08 after hours, I wasted to buy 136 even but it never reached. Now I am buying at breakout of $1 dollar. My next buy order is 138 and 139. I know AAPL will gap-up in premarket above 150. Ive seen in classic pattern after a robust earnings. Shorties will cover desperately eventually. Watch and learn"
"loading in more in the coming days. minor setback, major comeback."
buy today.. last chance under 150.
"Another $2-$3 gain coming tomorrow, up and up until earnings and then BOOM!!!"
Apple price raise from $140 to $170 by Cascend!!
From the UK is there some holiday today?
"IMO, if you have money in the bank ,move it ALL in AAPL.Who agrees?"
"I was at Walmart earlier today. The store clerk in electronics said that they have been out of iPads, many of the apple watches, xboxes, and playstations for about 2 1/2 weeks. Apple, Microsoft, and Sony should all have a good fourth quarter."
Looks like a case of insider trading here. Everybody interviewed on TV already personally talked to Cook and knew what the earnings numbers were going to be. Looks like the earnings results are already priced in. Certainly looks like somebody knew. An investigation is pending.
Can we hit $140 in AH
Goldman lost another 55 million on AAPL today.Rod Hall sure called it right.
Relax everyone. This will hit 147-150 within a few weeks. Lots of profit taking today from everyone who bought prior to earnings.
"When market sentiment is bad, the best company in the world does not move, amazing! that said, we will get to $160 sooner than later! Con call and forecast is going to be very important."
You miss me yet...
Patience and Stay long!This is long term hold stock!
What a bunch of Bologny. We should be up at least a few bucks. It has to be up tomorrow.
Just think how much money warren buffet will make this week?
might hit $142 tomorrow and on its way to $150
Singapore’s floating platform shop is filled with people queuing Everyday. So is the Changi Airport shop. Apple will beat the earnings by a huge margin.
Reddit retailers group will soon target Apple’s shorts! Trust me! Cover now or be like GT!
i want to buy some calls today for the earnings. Morgan Stanley has a target of $190 for AAPL. I am looking to add some $160 weekly calls today. May be get 200 of them during the day today.
Added more after great earnings report. looks like I should have waited.
SOON selling exhausted and with all the upgrades we resume uptrend. thx. buy here
What a consolidation that morning trade was!
Ever ore raises PT to 160
"DEJA VU. TOMORROW UPGRADES AND INVESTORS DOUBLING DOWN AND INSTITUTIONS BUYING AND HF INCREASING POSITIONS. STOCK WILL CLOSE ABOVE 149, GUARANTEED"
"If you want something good ($$$), then you mid term patients is priceless."

"Again. Bought 2 iPad Air 4s, 3 Earpod Pros, 1 Apple Watch SE, 1 Apple TV HD, 1 Family Apple Fitness+ year sub, and 1 Mac Air M1. All for Christmas. One guy for his family. Earnings will be through the roof."
Expecting good stock movement with Quarter 1 results.
Who thinks Apple will hit 150 within the next week and a half
It's because of all these GME Robinhood kids that Apple is taking a tumble like this!
Shorts today is your final day to pay... If not then Tomorrow U r going to lose your houses!!
"Another great day, ifYou sold shameOn you! Another $3-$5 day tomorrow and Wednesday I bet we see $8-$10 more!!!"
FUTURES are green! Nasdaq is 90 and counting! Guess who is pushing it?
$8 BILLION revenue beat! Simply amazing. Hold your shares until you are retired. Ignore the ups and downs. What a juggernaut
RSI is improving ! Don’t be spooked people !!
Apple will show how it’s done!$$$
"FB & AAPL will report strong earnings report, $AAPL is still at discount price, not a bubble at all ."
what are the best call options? i like Feb 19 $140 they should double maybe triple easily from today's price that's been the pattern into earnings every quarter for some time with exception of last quarter
Investors realize earnings will push this over $140 in 12 days? Wow maybe even a special dividend?
Began reading posts this morning and 1 in 4 are purely political. I will be busy for awhile muting all political opinions. Opinions on AAPL stock are truly appreciated as this is an APPLE page. PS: 8:30 AM jobs report. AAPL will be up  at closing regardless if report is negative. Stay strong and long my AAPL friends and have a great weekend.
Tells me it will be red tomorrow too
Once we clear the $138 all time high it’s straight to the moon. ER should take care of that 
Slowly going up!!!
"Question, sell $AAPL calls tomorrow or keep them a little longer?"
"So, Apple was up 85.31% YTD. So, small wonder there is some year end selling. Those that had the foresight to buy Apple before then, have had a terrific year. Others who bought during this year have nothing to complain about with the kind of performance the stock has had. So, maintain your cool and look forward to another great year to come."
"Analysts' up price targets seeing Apple at the forefront of digital transformation.. Best days ahead:Loup Ventures says Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) strong earnings report is evidence of the accelerating digital transformation in the fact that the revenue upside was driven by nearly one of the company's every product categories. Price target of $200.Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty maintains an Outperform rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and raises the price target from $152 to $164 after yesterday's FQ1 report.Huberty notes that the active device installed base (10% from 7% in last year's period) and customer loyalty is still above 90%.The broad-based revenue recovery in Greater China points to sustained higher engagement and market share gains, says Huberty.Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar (Overweight, $135 to $160) highlights the double-digit sales growth for all categories with the 17% Y/Y iPhone revenue boost indicating strong iPhone 12 demand. On the call, management mentioned that supplies remain tight for the iPhone Pro and Pro Max.Kumar notes that FQ1 gross margin came in well above expectations on the higher revenue and improved product mix, and Apple's margin forecast was largely flat for the current quarter.Evercore (Outperform, $160 to $163) says ""there is no need for Reddit mentions with a performance like this.""Analyst Amit Daryanani calls gross margins the ""sleeper upside.""The analyst thinks the lack of guidance for iPhone and Mac sales suggests material acceleration in those markets, offset by modest decelerations for Services and Wearables.Apple shares are down 2.4% pre-market to $138.64 in what is proving to be a notably volatile week for the Street.On the earnings call, Apple management said current quarter growth should accelerate on the year and follow typical seasonality on the quarter. The company said it expects Wearables deceleration in FQ2, coming down from those record holiday-driven sales.Background: Apple's FQ1 revenue hits all-time record as iPhone sales smash estimates"
"'A combination of pent up demand and a host of 5G models are likely driving the iPhone's robust sales. The report suggests that the momentum is expected to continue through China's Lunar New Year holiday on Feb. 12, which would give Apple another quarter of ""staggering"" sales similar to Q4.`"
Shorts posting now after they covered and lost money! Haaaaaa
Disgusted.
"If Apple announced it was going into Bankruptcy, would we have gone up $5 today?"
Hope Tesla doesn’t beat us.
$4 yesterday $4 today moving like it did before split this is way behind from upgrades for 2 months sat on lows now moving up as long as nasq is up this will rise to earnings when it hits 140 maybe tomorrow then it gets to 145 by Wednesday earnings after the close will pop 15-20 you’ll see Apple around 165-167 Thursday Friday 170 next week if there’s news on Tuesday or WednesdayAnything car dividends making a good pop over 145 maybe hit 150 then we are looking over 170 next Thursday or Friday a 180 stock would blow my Wad
trading sideways the day before earnings is nothing to over analyze...
Well Done Apple ! Well Done on record earnings! Stock will be $160 by end of next week!
Shorts....
"Anybody bought the 158, 160, and 170 calls for this week?"
The rebellion needs to spread into Apple now. The manipulation of this stock is brutal. The shorts are trying to keep the price down with relentless selling pressure even though the company earnings was the best quarter ever. People need to hold and never sell their share and keep buying to drive the price up to eliminate the short sellers.
$139 soon
We should be up like $10
They can’t hold it down much longer! What company would give their left nut for Apples numbers? We should be up $10 with the Nasdaq up 200 plus
Just have a feeling that earnings are going to be higher than the highest estimates....and drive us to 150 within a month
I thought Apple a DAYS ago Joe are we going to have green or red apples after earnings tomorrow??
"Are you kidding? Why is the stock price dropping? Are the usual shorties trying to drive the price down. Investors, hold on to your shares. that was an extraordinary earning for 2020 with or without the Covid-19!"
Excellent returns will be celebrated by those who believed and waited.

"Who can show how the company gets to 1 trillion in sales from 300 billion? Unless they start selling low margin cars, there is no way. Assume average sale is 1,000 dollars....70 million new customers? Really"
I bought 1k shares at $138. Should I cut my losses?
Overdone
Dan Riccio is in charge of a secret new Apple project...I wonder what it is?...
The sleepy one reminds me of the dictator from the Woody Allan movie Bananas.
Closed above the 50 dma. Not the end of the world.
Insider news is that apple is releasing their concept car tomorrow. Who is ready for a 1000 mile car.
"I have 250k I made from GME that I cashed out EOD... should’ve held since it’s up 50% AH but oh well... thinking of putting it all into Apple and using my 1200 shares to buy COvered Calls with them and live off the premiums, what do you guys think ?"
Bring these big companies down is the best things for us all it is like Christmas came early 
selling all my apple shares. Sad to do it but I cannot in good faith stand with a company that believes in censorship of others voices. Will not buy it again until some changes with the company guidance.
The run to earnings has begun. Apple will Beat the 27 cent eps estimate by a mile. Look for a huge beat.
Aapl setting for big run after earnings.
"Read a few posts lately regarding Cook & Management. Considering market is up big time this morning, I'm baffled and started to wonder if there is a real disconnect between Apple and market, or market lost appetite."
moderna ceo said covid will be with us forever. work/school will be on a permanent hybrid model
Big funds are shaking up money tree off the inpatient investors before they start buying again on good ER. Hold on tight!
"the market is going to crash. with 35% cash, I will be loading up. i want it to crash."
So most of the regular investors bought Apple after what happened with game stop our they punishing the little guy in retaliation?
About to bounce back and push to 150 let’s go fam 
Goldman Sachs better NOT manipulate Apple stock with low price target from the recent incredible quarter earning! They have numerous times trying to manipulate apple stock with their ridiculous price projection. Why are they so negative with apple stock?
My estimates for earnings are: Sales 108 Bil - 115 Bil and EPS of 1.50 - 1.70 !!!
17 B shares? What a joke. NEVER should have split this
Revenue: $111.44 billion versus $103.12 billion expectedEarnings per share: $1.68 versus $1.42 expectediPhone revenue: $65.68 billion versus $60.33 billion expectedService revenue: $15.76 versus $14.89 billion expected
"If you want to know options expiration manipulation is real, then you will watch how Apple trades tomorrow and where it closes."
I really think we hit $150 prior to earnings release and $165 after
Outrageous. AAPL has the best revenue fever but continue to stop after earnings. That goes to tell you how much the market is stealing your money. Whatever they want to do to play your heads. Stealing our $$ every day. This should be at 200 already.
"Strong Buy,Strong Buy,Strong Buy at this current very very low price because very soon It's going to be $200 plus. (very very strong buy)Bullish"
And why is this down 4% on top of the 4% yesterday?
So how good are earnings going to be with this new Iphone out? We've had a lot of closures of the apple stores over the past couple of months.. what effects does that have on the earnings?
Can’t waste 500 point Dow days like this. utterly DISGUSTING action after good earnings.
The Feb 05 $150 calls are gold at current price...
"Big tech including Apple donated big $ to Dems. Dow Up this morning over 200 points, sky didn’t fall AAPL will turn around and gain big this year no matter who runs the country. So just relax. AAPL and rest of big tech will continue on an upward trend."
Regardless of Thursday’s AAPL performances it will be in the $160s by early March.
No guidance is the reason for the pull back? They never give guidance. It will be positive after the opening bell. The future continues to look very strong.
Sure am glad I have me some Apple!
"ok kids, a short squeeze requires actual short positions, not 0.5% of float."
"If $MSFT didn’t go up after there great earnings tomorrow, it means $AAPL & $FB will follow the same."
Omg it’s going down sell before the historic earnings Not!  Go Apple 
Tomorrow $150!!!
It's earnings week kids! Here we go now.
"Happy investing very good perspective but here is the reality no matter how or who try’s to manipulate this stock, It will fly to $200 plus sooner than later this year guaranteed"
"Too many young investors and/or traders on this board. Apple may not rise 50% in one month, but it will deliver fantastic returns in the long run. Look at the 5 year chart and tell me what it is you don't understand. Who cares about daily moves. The long term picture is what matters most. Own it don't trade it. Apple long!"
I should of shorted it early today would of made a few grand.
My near term target is $180
Sad.. a strong Green Day but Apple not acting positively..
Look at what predatory capital is doing up your wealth pre market !Squeeze the shorts out of apple 
Shortly there will be many people saying “Why didn’t I buy more!”
Like past anticipated blow out quarters Apple runs up through earnings and than profit taking afterwards.
.....save the Peter Lynch I like AAPL 'cause every douche Millennial is crowding into their stores. That's not how margin expansion works. The win for AAPL is multi-pronged....and the REASON THIS QUARTER WILL BE A BLOW OUT IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL.
GS wrong again on downgrading  to sell They want your cheap shares before earnings. $150 next stop!
"Don’t forget: day traders will always buy low, sell high and eventually buy even higher "
"Pay attention to MSFT reporting after today's close. If they will eat up expectations (expected as I sure hope cause I own a decent amount but not as much as AAPL), then watch AAPL AH people trying to catch up. That would translate NOT only AAPL will blow earnings to smithereens, but A MAJOR LIFT OFF GO APPLE!!!"
"I’m using Apple Watch, iMac, Mac Air, Apple TV, now I’m waiting for Apple car"
Anyone loan out stock to their broker? I received 4 calls and about a dozen emails from JP Morgan/Chase and Schwab in the last days. Looks like the going rate is 10%. 12-15% for high volatility stocks and ADR’s??
hopefully it will be like Netflix earningsit will be nice to go parabolic in after hours like +20$
Everyone wants in before $150
Please drop to $110.00
"Why is this down???? Apple beat records on every end, top and bottom. products sales on everything, all time highs! and this is . down￼? The situation is unacceptable"
It's pretty obvious big firms are buying up shares the past few days like crazy...they know this is a blowout quarter for revenue and earnings...upgrades already coming even before earnings....they aren't buying now unless the plan is to push this past 160 after ER....hope you are in before the ER...follow the money always
To the moon let’s go 
"Oh yes, AAPL will hit $3trillion cap in 6-9 months, or 178 pps..."
Blown up hedge funds selling winners like Apple to raise cash. After desperation selling is over Apple will rise.
bought 50 shares thanks for the discount.
ZUCK TWITTER! - TURN OUT THE LIGHTS!!!!$FB $AAPL $AMAZN $GOOG
Companies with negative earnings go up by 400% in a day. Go figure
"I agree with Mr. Sidwell. There is no reason for a selloff right now. AAPL should thrive in a work from home environment. You go out for a walk/run early in the morning, stop at the corner Starbucks and grab a coffee. You then come back home and finish your school project on your Macbook. Later you put in your airpods to listen to some sick tunes on your Apple Music App. Meanwhile your Apple watch is always on your wrist tracking your calorie expenditure and is taking care of your grocery payment with Apple Pay. Im pretty sure you are storing all of your important work on iCloud because it is safe there. If you still think Apple is going to get a correction after reading this, please by all means sell and be bearish!"
Someone the last 5 days has shown America exactly what his policies are. The people who act invest real money in the markets are showing you exactly what they think about those policies. Tomorrow will be a bloodbath in all 3 markets again. Be prepared for the bear markets coming. Young melinials are about to see a pretty bear market.
WE tried to rally to $144+; we failed.TOmorrow is always another day
"Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia."
AAPL going to the moon after hour trading!
I have put sell order at $150 for 300 shares.....Hope we reach that price.
"Honestly I hope this opens flat tomorrow so I can buy more shares, that earnings call was incredible"
"Wedbush Dan Ives raises his price target to $175 from $160 with an outperform rating, nice!"
Will this quarter be the best report in aapl history?
Daniel Ives raises AAPL to $175.
Samsung reported weaker sales on their Galaxy phones due to the new iPhone 12 phones as per Bloomberg TV. We should be looking at a massive ER soon. 
Bought 1000 shares at close
"Guys, so how it is works: after earnings it is down or it is flying up? Thinking about selling shares but not sure when the highest point? Wait until February or to do next week? Please advise experience investors"
I guess Apple should have missed by $8B to go up.
"Here are the key numbers:EPS: $1.68 vs $1.41 expected, according to Refinitiv consensus estimatesRevenue: $111.44 billion vs $103.28 billion expected, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates"
"INSANE, UNBELIEVABLE REASULTS. SELLERS AND SHORTS ARE TOAST. THE STOCK WILL MOVE UP 6- 8 TOMORROW GUARANTEED"
Too many misguided investors are buying poor performance companies and drive price way up. Here is the winner with quality and tomorrow we see $170.
"who lost tons of money in the Dotcom 2000 implosion and the 2008 crash? like Groucho Marx said ""I would have lost even more if I had more to lose"""
This has been consolidating since its split and high around August. It touched a new ATH not long ago and soon that will become new support above $138.00 with a market cap above $2.3T. PT at $150-$160 market cap of $2.5T-2.7T for 2021. (This does not factor buybacks of stock) which is a positive for bulls!
NOBODY BUYS ANYMORE A LAPTOP OR IPAD OR MOBILE PHONE BUT AAPL. AAPL WIL BEAT BIG AND GUIDE BIG. CAN GO UP 12 DOLLARS POST EARNINGS. TRADE AT 160
"Like it or not, Apple will finish the year on a high note. $140? $145? I can’t wait until the earnings end of Jan. Good job to all the Apple investors. May your investments continue to double in 2021! All the best!"
This makes no common sense garbage stocks go up and the best earnings and profits and strongest company in the world stock tanks it should of exploded..very confused. Still buying for long term very disappointed for today
"I've been long AAPL for a while and its been great. I think they will continue to grow. I'm admittedly not a technical trader, but I do find it interesting. Is anyone that is a technical trader willing to give your thoughts on a cup and handle formation over the 6 month chart? It looks like we had the handle yesterday (high of 138, low of 108), handle formation <70% of high and now moving up?"
"4:30 when news is normally released , right?"
X's 1.5 volume... another big bite on the apple upside!
Msft up 5% AH...preview of Apple tomorrow
Not unusual. These are the people who are new to the market or can’t afford to lose anything. They over react to the herd. Patience. Let the storm pass. It always does. Look at the 20 year history for comfort.
Apple 7 watch to have blood glucose monitoring!!!
"I'm guaranteeing this stock will be green before the morning hits you'll be sorry you did not get in at this low price, You'll See"
Hope there will be more sympathy and love for the seniors by increasing S.S. Payments as promised to them during mid year 2020
Bull case raised to a high of $225 for Apple
Dow is down over 600 points just today. Its down over 1000 since Joe became pres. This is Joe's economy. We owe the downfall you the liberals. Good job.
another $1 down...100% manipulation..
and here comes the reversal
FB recovered from it's huge early dip
So why is this going down after hours? Thought today was going to be the big day?
Tip your waiter or waitress extra nice this week....courteous of Apple.
"Market needs hope and hype both...Tesla, other EVs, Roku- you name it. These companies feed market with both. They are engaged and rewarding for shareholders. In the name of secrecy, Apple is not engaging with market. They shut down Hyundai and always tight lipped, why? Times changed and lots of things changed from 10-15 years ago. May be they need to change that strategy now. It’s time, high time."
"Let's see, incredible quarterly report, stock price drops 4%, will open lower tomorrow. My opinion, some manipulation at play. No rational reason a stock should drop that much after a great report, even in a down market; unless the fundamentals no longer mean anything."
Can’t imagine what wall street would have done here on a day like today with a miss.
Remember 30 July was earnings and price up 10 dollars. I thought now will the same. Hopefully Apple will recover and this year we close more then 200 per share.
AAPL: remember Apple increase 30% iPhone volume 2 weeks ago...It means AAPL will hit 141$ by friday
"A new stimulus plan will be revealed this evening Thursday Jan 14th possibly after hours. I'd say the market rallies tomorrow or end of the day today. Either way, skies are looking GREEN. Apple long! Own it don't trade it."
The Market is going to tank boys. Take your profits and take a break.
LG Electronics just reported earnings. They had their best sales for displays to Apple since 2017. This may give a positive sign to Apple's earnings report coming up.
Shorts don’t sweat. Can you feel the power of Apple? 
"So Apple has a blowout massive quarter and is down but But American Airlines is up,64% PM. That makes sense."
Good luck longs see you tomorrow 
Flat. I’ll take it. Now we move onward and upward. Earnings days at $&#@. Always beat up tech stocks.
Best message board quote of the day:“This was so gonna be in the money if none of this stuff that’s going on happened.”— @Michael
I was skeptical of the theory that hedge funds are selling Apple to cover their enormous losses on Gamestop. But it makes sense. Apple is the biggest holding for theses hedge funds and they have been forced to cover billions in losses. Same thing is going to happen today based on the huge premarket surge in GS.
I bought my first 100 shares today. I like your plan
Slowly slowly everything turning positive . The biotechnology just turned positive
$TSLA $AAPL $WIMI lol all the bears come out with low future. 
wow! finally!  God loves us! stay strong and keep long! 
"i call #$%$ analysts putting unrealistic expectations on Apple, figures."
Should be at same price of amazon and Tesla!
"Monday will be a great start for earnings, let's hope it breaks 145.."
nice to see it inching up into the close. good momentum for monday rebound.
I thought apple would be $125 today you shorties?
So market makers will drag apple down today and tomorrow so calls don’t end in the money then make it moon Monday absolutely awful
Market is on the cusp of a huge down trend. Be careful everyone. If the S&P500 doesn’t hold key levels we could have some dark days ahead.
Apple has 190 billion cash sitting in bank. They have to buy own stock like softbank sftby to kick the xxxs of shorts and old school sleepy analyst. By year end apple should trade around 200$
* Apple Inc : Evercore ISI raises target price to $160 from $145* Apple Inc : Raymond James raises target price to $150 from $140* Apple Inc : Wedbush raises price target to $175 from $160
Hello all! I’m new here and just wanted to know how you all feel about Apple pursuing EV? Do you think it will actually happen? TIA
Apple will continue to climb in price. It could very well be $200 by year's end.
Longs here to
Options on fire LETS GOOOO
Sadly it not long ago that Bears were saying this would be under $100 because 70 million people were going to return in their iPhones. It’s like when people say they are quitting social media for good.
The whole market is down folks. Relax. I see a late afternoon rally tomorrow after a slow start
All the money is following WSB stocks. No one interested to buy the big techs for now.
"All is good, buy on the dip if it helps your cost basis. Otherwise,relax."
I guess if you wanted to buy you could buy now or tomorrow at $150?
How much longer is this going to go on? Wow - amazing
"While looking at CES 2021 an Asus laptop with a weird second screen on it, a transparent TV, a laptop computer with an external faster drive that attaches to it, and a N95 mask with speakers HAHA .. Apple is going to completely school the competition again!"
"When Apple reports its earnings on Wednesday, you can expect mentions of India on the call.India I phones sells knocked it out of the ball park :)"
Does Apple announce earnings before or after the market closes on Wednesday?
hedge funds short it down to buy cheap shares
"the bulls are going to win this race. No question about it. Hold strong,or buy more."
"Look at FB and msft ! Really cannot understand what's happening after that earnings report. For those of you who say ""soon green"" what are your reasons ???"
These are dream scenarios that happen occasionally and you have to take advantage. A blockbuster ER and the stock sells off. I have been in Apple a very long time and every time this scenario plays out it turned out to be a massive buying opportunity. Me thinks that’s what we are looking at here compadres. 
"Sleep well longs, tomorrow is our day."
Why is AAPL down? A great quarter with awesome earnings ! Overall market is way up! This should be surging!
I want to do a $150 option call for 03/19/21. you guys think we'll be in the money by then?
iPhone sales SMASH expectations!!!! CHOOOO CHOOOOOOO!!!! All aboard!!!!
"Definition of Long-term Investment:""A sure-winner short-term bet gone sour.""(Longs her just realized that they've wasted six months of their life.)"
With the big gains in Dow and Nasdaq and that incredible earnings report I gotta believe we go higher later in the session!
"Earnings is so close AAPL was up loads, why the sudden drop?"
MSFT was down by $10 yesterday but its fully recovered by $12 today but this stock is ????
DTRAIN : clearly anonymous is playing Apple short . In some way . Wrong play bro
will be green by 11a
The rest of the earnings this year will be beat! Dividends coming in a couple weeks
Get your orders in now
"As I recall, AAPL had a great report last quarter beating all estimates and yet the stock sold off by 8 -10% the next day. Curious about thoughts for the upcoming report and the market reaction. I am holding 2500shares for the long haul, but also have Feb calls ranging from 125 to 145. Would appreciate your thoughts."
Lookd like earnings not going to matter. Big boards are going down as institutions are cashing in now.
Sold Apple at $118 threw that at $NIO and that worked out. Sold all my $AMD yesterday and put that in $AAPL yesterday 
#bngo #gme #amc #tsla #aaplBngo going up. Lets goooo 
Do you think the profits from GME will find their way into Apple?
Unloading half my position. Hate giving back and this market looks ready to do just that.
Going back to 80 - buy then
"Apple is not a good stock to own anymore, things are changing just like COVID did to the worlds. People are going for the quick money and that's all there is too it. Look at all the quick hitters that made people rich, Tesla, GME, AMC and many more. Why buy the Apple and PG stock when its a waste of years waiting for a $10 gain. F this. READ THIS"
"Profit taking and shorting is why it is down! I’ve seen this time and time again! Tomorrow I will repurchase share I sold at $139! APPL will go up! Just gotta have patience! With all the news...did you really think the share price was gonna skyrocket? Sell the news! In any case...ain’t nothing stoping AAPL! Long and strong is best method! I just like to sell when there is a significant bounce in price, then buy back in a few dollars less! Good luck all!"
"I don't know what's happening, but from 140 I keep adding 20 stocks for every dollar down.I'll keep doing this, so I don't care if I see 120. AAPL rewards the patient ones."
"$TSLA and $AAPL MEGA BUBBLES will COLLAPSE BIG Time after Earning Reports! AAPL is entering its DOWNTURN!Tesla BUBBLE is Overvalued by 5000%, while AAPL BUBBLE is Overvalued by 400%."
Anyone have a good explanation of the huge dip in the market this morning?
"Been holding Apple since iPhone announcement in 2007Now at 4,874% return on my investment -Not too bad. Will continue to hold at least 10 more years and sleep very well at night not worrying about day to day price changes. Apple is a long term play folks so quit worrying about day to day price changes."
"Guidance, Revenue and Earnings will likely be good - Meanwhile, this stays flat. Sad days ahead..."
And again the proof that this is an univestable market .. no logic whatsoever. Wait until dust settles
"many new billionaires in the time of the pandemic and worst economy. while many lose their jobs. nobody can save unless you buy stocks. house cost $400k, tuition $30k a year, new truck $40k. and if you get medical bill you are bankrupt."
We won't leave you APPLE dear just so you won't BE LONELY!!!!
This has become an old safe stock like Amazon the money has been made unless you want to wait ten years there are better options now. Amazon has been a sloth for months now
LOT OF OIL COMPANY NEXT YEAR WILL NOT EXIST ANYMORE
Apples best earnings ever they said look for 175-185
This will continue up after inauguration when people realize the sky is not falling.
will finish today $145 and tomorrow $150
Aapl crushed it. Patience. The reward is coming.
I look at the bright side we are still up on 5 day chart as a long through the last 2 splits I have done very well
Just goes to show you that blowout record earnings means nothing on a heavily manipulated stock like Apple. Beware all the euphoria leading up to events and then the sell off. Happens every time. But it will recover quickly always does
"After all this pumping fiasco is over, people will put their gains into long terms with amazing value, aka apple!"
Beat with good guidance and we’re looking at $150 - $160 if we don’t get near prior to.
In five years when we're looking at 300 most of the noisemakers will be long gone...no pun intended. I've bought and sold stocks for 45 years and AAPL is one core holding I won't trade. It's a legacy stock for the grandchildren.
Hold on to your shares Sally...you'll never time the market. You don't sell Apple. You buy and HOLD!
How rich and powerful can Wall Street be when they can literally control this stock and its trillion dollar market cap to pin the stock price for options expiration. I am sorry but this is why the WSB movement will continue.
"the slow decline is shareholders with hundreds of millions in Apple stock selling out to sub 100 lots, over and over"
Computer generated sell off on tech just kicked in at 10:55. Look at Nasdaq and entire tech sector just dropped.
I’m happy to be holding Apple. Think of the people who are holding that black hole “Game Stop” into the weekend.
Hows that record ER feeling? Nothing criminal here
Buying boatloads.....3300 more shares. Gift at this price. Ill retire end of this year - all on Apple. :-)
Every one calm down. We are all Americans and here on this page as investors. So I ask everyone please respect each other and let’s keep it civil. On this page I for one would like to connect and touch on AAPL. Political left or right should be muted. Again a reminder to all: please let’s convey our thoughts on AAPL. Have a peaceful and a good night. 
Easily a 3 to 3.5 trillion market cap company within 5 years
"111 $Billion in sales last quarter.30% increase inJapanese sales50% increase in China sales.40% profit margin.Jeez........Hedge funds dumping AAPL to cover their losses in GME.BIG buying opportunity, here."

I was gonna buy a new Apple phone but I’m broke now
Only wish I would have bought more today. Excellent quarter and couldn’t ask for better news!
Get ready for a stock split at Microsoft. The Microsoft Shorts are getting Clobbered.
so glad I bought 500 more shares yesterday
Sell sell sell.........Apple will disappoint this time around. Expectations are too lofty. Tomorrow it will open below $125.......
"Basically where we were 10 days ago. Looks like it will drop further before finding support. Good quarter, future still looks good. Short term the market can be irrational, but long term it's very rational. See what Feb holds."
is apple going up today after today's financial results of Q1 2021?
Apple doesn’t know how to go down. It’s just going up.. plus Apple car. Maybe two to three years later it’s gonna sky rocket again and change all the EV market

Buy Buy Buy ! Apple is on sale!
It’s silly to go against companies that make money. Especially the way that Apple makes money.
6% off of the high.That will take 6-8 months to make up. It isn't TSLA GME TLRY or one of the reddit faves.
Will Apple stock keep going up this week?
"What’s the average annual return of Apple shares. I’m looking at starting to invest in either Apple or an etf like ARKK. Just wanted some input, I read on google that it was like 42% average annually for the last ten years ? Still new to stocks and what not . Thanks !"
160$ after ER
Wow just looked at Apple we are heading to 150 today
Apple working in VR? Wow get ready to be 3 trillion dollars very soon 
Hedge funds sale shares after hours back and forth for small losses to drop the price. creating a lower buy in as we know this going up and hoping retail investors sell. No risk as they already know the earnings were awesome and lost of reward. This is APPL it will go up.
"people are selling lmao when earning comes and apple hit 200! iPhone 12 pro max! sold out, headphones, home mini, apple store, apple music apple is an amazing company to invest so much supply and demands"
"You can’t keep a great stock down—it was only a matter of time. If AAPL ‘has’ been under manipulative pressure for almost 5 months now, those manipulators have either lost control to retail investors, or relinquishing on purpose for the guaranteed capital gain to come"
Typical hedge fund manipulation on expiration day...but no one says anything about this ..stock drops from 143 to 130 on the great earnings ever and 196 billion in cash...

Looks like 145 today Hopefully 148-149 tomorrow We will be in position for the 170+ Look at NFLX no Cash Flow yet but subs went up to 200 million Stock popAt earnings $72 Apple is going to produce there best earnings ever in history think about that the most I’ve seen Apple jump is $38 + imagine if even that on 150 we would have Friday to finish it off
Is this the AAPL forum or a Trumpet support group?
Game and AMC shorts have to have covered by now...nothing holding up the stocks once shorts have covered....amazing stuff
Keeep calm 1$ down we call this Market
Apple Car Tonight!!!
"This is really getting ridiculous. Can Apple mgmnt get involved like a buy back? Do something to stop this spiraling. I know it’s paper loss and a recoup is imminent but not everyone can be that calm about it. Mgmnt statement of assurance would go a long way, perhaps even to turn it around today. Are you listening TIM?"
This is just a pullback and it’s an oversold pullback ! Income investors should hold hold hold !!
Don’t worry ! FB CEO just said on earnings call that Appl their biggest competitor! I urge everyone on this board to read these comments! Apple controls the keys to advertising! Think about that ! Not just a hardware producer ! I expect a lot of FB investors to be buying Apple stock instead of FB !
Here we go!!
"Could it be any more obvious that there was manipulation DURING the session when algos run, when AAPL takes off AH?"
Raised price targets as earnings nears.  $150.00+
The market is so rigged & manipulated
The good will bounce back higher. The bad will not.
Buy it up and hold. Anyone really believe this thing won't average higher than market returns over the next 10 years?
roll out the prototype self flying/driving car...............................
"Don't be fooled,there are enormous call options over 135 they want to expire worthless.. That's the reason it struggle so much at that price, once they are removed the skies will clear.. focus on next month"
"New all time highs after earnings. iPhone 12 has been selling at record numbers and the services follow iphones sales. Redesign, 5G and stay at home pandemic have caused sales to surge."
"Although I realize everyone hates seeing the market turn red, it's actually healthy and keeps the market from overheating."
Heading towards 143
Wow. Nice start with pre .
Did they mention stock buy backs at all on the call ?
"TODAY :Apple (AAPL +3.7%) has reportedly hired former Tesla exec Stuart Bowers for its car team in the latest sign that the project is moving forward.Bowers was the VP of Engineering at Tesla before leaving in 2019 after a 16-month stint.Apple is several years away from producing a car (some reports suggest five), but is expected to cast a large shadow on how EV-tech partnerships shake out."
"Remember AAPL, AMD, MSFT reported a great Q, hedge fund shorts trying to scare the the herd................."
Down on a good quarter? This should be an indication to buy the dip. AAPL will be $200 soon.
"Will sell my Apple shares at a loss on Monday, I don't care will still sell!!!"
Soooo whats the deal for earnings??? Puts or Calls? What price??
Sell this and buy GME. You won't regret it.
The pandemic accelerated Apple’s business!
"I'm expecting that the dividend increase will most likely be for the May dividend payout, not the one in February, based on the historical dividends trend. The increase may or may not be announced in the upcoming January earnings but it will be announced. I'm predicting a 5 to 6% increase."
"So far AAPL’s price action shows it’s most certainly being controlled — in a very unnatural, artificial way...no other conclusion"
"The sky isn’t falling!! The price of shares is, if you want to make money buy more!!! Buy now!!!! This will be fine in a couple of days maybe aooner’n"
Thumbs up if this going back to 138 thumbs down if over valued
"This is unreal, Apple should trending upward from recent earning...going to place all my shares GTC for $1000 to protect it from being borrowed."
All the bubble stocks are getting killed. The money from them will flow to safer stocks like AAPL. Been long and strong since 2011. AAPL doesn’t disappoint long term INVESTORS.
"I Feel a Split is Coming,,,after Apple Goes to 400-Oh Baby,,,, I Love You Apple"
18mm iphone 12 units sold in china last quarter (20% higher than estimates). earnings will destroy estimates.
Is Apple partnering with Kia to build an EV car?
it's just hedge funds selling
So am I correct in stating that Hedge Fund people will drive the market down until they can buy in on cheap stocks like AAPL run it up and sell once again. Rinse and repeat.
"The weak people who are selling right now do not have the constitution to be in the stock market! Buy, hold and stay the course ! Turn that fear off and apple will take you to the moon "

"Hold, dont sell!!!"
Remember the 3-day rule. Just hang tight. We shall overcome !!!
Gonna 'splode tonight and tomorrow.
we should be taking out ATH every day next week...then rocket ship will be lifting off Wednesday after hours.
"Right on, Tim. You tell ‘em!In his speech, Cook laid into algorithm-driven social media platforms, painting them as, “An interconnected ecosystem of companies and data brokers, of purveyors of fake news and peddlers of division, of trackers and hucksters just looking to make a quick buck.”"
"Excerpts from the Motley Fool. 1. You still have to wait forever to get an iPhone 12 Pro Apple is reportedly ramping up production for the iPhone 12 in the first half of 2021. Combined with other factors suggesting very strong iPhone sales for the quarter, the higher ASP should lead to iPhone revenue significantly outperforming. And considering iPhone accounts for 50% of revenue, and typically closer to 60% in the first quarter, that should have a meaningful impact on its revenue versus expectations. 2. Suppliers are posting big revenue numbers Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, Foxconn, announced record revenue for the month of December. The Taiwanese company, which trades as Hon Hai Precision, reported sales of 713.8 billion New Taiwan dollars (about $25.5 billion) for December, and quarterly revenue of NT$2 trillion. That beat expectations of NT$1.8 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Foxconn's outperformance is also in line with the greater-than-expected demand for the iPhone 12 Pro. The company is the exclusive supplier of the high-end devices. Meanwhile, Dialog Semiconductor raised its fourth-quarter revenue outlook from a range of $380 million to $430 million to between $436 million and $441 million, Barron's reports. The chipmaker cited increased demand for 5G chips as the reason. Considering Apple accounts for the majority of its revenue, it's a pretty good bet those chips are going in iPhone 12s. And in late December, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said his Asia supply chain checks ""have now exceeded even our 'bull case scenario'"" in a note to investors. 3. New records in the App Store Apple reported record gross sales for its App Store in its annual new year update. In the week between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, iOS users spent $1.8 billion in the App Store. That's up 27% from last year, and an acceleration from the 16% growth in sales in the same period in 2019. The company also recorded $540 million in sales on New Year's Day, up nearly 40% from last year. Those numbers indicate a lot of new iPhones under the tree this year. It also bodes well for Apple's all-important services segment -- its fastest-growing and highest-margin business. The App Store is Apple's most profitable service, generating gross profits well above its subscription services like Apple Music or Apple TV+. So outperformance on that front should lead to better-than-expected earnings. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty notes, ""If we keep the rest of our December quarter Apple Services forecast unchanged, the latest App Store data would imply December quarter Services revenue of $14.84 [billion] ... 40 [basis points] ahead of consensus at $14.78 [billion]."" It's very likely, however, that stronger App Store sales are a good indication of stronger sales of Apple's other services. It looks like the iPhone supercycle may be a reality this year based on the early results we've seen and other hints at strong demand. And that'll bolster Apple's entire business -- and the FAANG stock -- when it reports its full results on Jan. 27."
Not much discussion of Apple here. Any idea where can I find actual discussion of their business and not a bunch social commentary?
"dang it!!. i wanted to buy after hours under 137, any way I bought at 137.38. This is classic manipulation of smart money with market makers. They will stop out all retailers, so they can cover in premarket. The force of retailers will wipe out institution like gamestop. I hear 150 in pre market. I know their intentions.. buy load up with both hand. There is no way price can be before earnings despite tsunami earnings. Gut feeling tell me a BIG SHORT SQUEEZE Is coming to AAPL"
Elon proved how easy it is to manipulate a stock in this market climate
simple...HOLD...this will correct it self.~B400+ billion in annual sales with 30% revenue growth and 25 %margin...this will be up in 4-5 days...you know this company is a leader and innovators....your money is safe as long as you leave your emotions out of it.they are fundamentally sound.HOLD!!!
Great Earnings ReportHappy....I'm long...not concerned with a few dollar up or down now...in the long run upwards trend unbroken ;)
Wow what a buying opportunity that was! New support base validated!
I saw it trending south so I sold & went to $$$ - investing 101 - always protect your Capital- always
Wow! It’s going up PRE- Market ! Buy Buy! Move your money here!
The after hours buy volume is incredible!
Buy Apple Hold Apple and Profit from Apple 
"Buy the dip!! It’s an opportunity to have more stocks. Apple is huge and huge plans for 2021. Apple is not just iPhone now, they are in hardware and number of services."
Appl watch rumored to feature blood glucose monitoring. HUGE if true. Gamechanger! LFG!
"THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE FLAW OR BAD GUIDANCE IN THE EARNING REPORT. THE SHORTS , BEARS AND SELLERS WILL BE DEVESTATED. NUMBER ONE STOCK TO OWN IS AAPL. EXPECT UP 5 TOMORROW"
as warren always stays... you need to be greedy when others are panicking. and jimmy chill will tell you no one ever made a dime panicking. just be cool and watch it rally back to the 140s and retest the highs around 147. it will settle to a new ath in the 150s to split the new pt range 150-160.
"If you’re smart, hold on to this forever. If your not long term just hold on to this until the earnings report following when stores reopen. Don’t you dare think about selling lol"
"Apple’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021."
Dow down 120....Apple up $1.15. Nice.
Toyota sold 10 million cars worldwide last year and made a $400 profit per car. Apple sold 300 Million phones and made a profit of $400 per phone.. So I ask you.......do you want to be Toyota or Apple? I’ll answer that for you. You want to be Apple.
Any chance this pulls back to 135 before earnings

Apples Going to $400!! if gamestop can. then sellers of gamestop can easily pump Apple!!
I've just added to my AAPL position. Patience. Stay long.
"Sorry AAPL people I bought 2K shares at $138 earlier and it never fells! If I think It's gotta be the bottom, it ain't! Anyway, as the late great Vince Lombardi would say; What the HELL is going on out there! Geeezz :) Oh well I'm pretty sure it's going to $150 in Feb. Cheer's"
"11000 people lost good paying jobs on keystone pipeline with onecareless stroke of a pen of clueless, geriatric. Millions will be paying at least double for energyfor the next 4 years."
"Yes, When AAPL was at $137.40 I did post to take profits on Jan 22 calls.Then AAPL ran to $140.Who knew?Anyway, by taking those profits on the Jan 22 calls off the table the market makers were not going to close AAPL below $135 which they were trying to do.Option expiration is very tricky. The trick is to be first"

"Years ago, when the P/E was 12 I argued here everyday, multiple times a day, how AAPL deserved a much higher P/E. Now, AAPl's P/E is almost at historic heights The argument is once again the same but reversed. The argument is the P/E is rich but earnings will drop it. There is no reason for this price actionOnce again, people have different risk tolerance, time horizons and cash flow requirements. No one can decided for another.Good Luck"
so manipulated by the institution and shorts. teach em a lesson and do that short squeeze on this AAPL buy and hold
Apple and Microsoft share price appreciated more than 5 times in last 5 years whereas gross revenue increased by 2 to 3 times. It seems stock price still on high side compared to revenue growth. Some correction is expected in near term on fundamentals.
"If you've been waiting to get in, this is your buying opportunity. This will fly in the coming days."

Are shorts ganging apple now? Seen they lose a lot on small cap
Awesome beat for Apple! I just bought some. $150 plus pretty soon I believe. Good luck all!
They earn more $$ than any company in the history of planet Earth. I never quite get the Apple bashing? Buy and hold seems a wise strategy.

Look back at my comments I predicted Apple 110b revenue. And someone commented that t is too high a prediction.. look what now?
expectations game always very low for big tech.so the analysts sure the company will beat and stocks will jump.investors should look at valuations
All the smart ones are jumping in today. Next week will be much higher!!
AAPL is currently priced at just north of 20% earnings growth every year for the next 10 years. The last ten years were 16% growth with the greatest growth in 2011 to 2015. Apple .s a 2.5 trillion company where is all that cash going to come from to fuel that 20% growth…stock buybacks i don't think are the answer.
big money going scorched earth. see who blinks first. they got $$$$. 20% correction to put the hurt on. big recovery 2nd half.
Thank You Apple - It is RIGHT that facebook must ask if they can track users for AD purposes and what ever else the do... Please implement the change Very SOON...
Biggest earnings and revenue in history. Going to the sky.
"buy the dips on AAPL, Christmas only 11 months away"
Past January history suggests AAPL will trend higher this upcoming week and month. And profit-bookers from 30 days ago most certainly will be buying back in
Are people selling AAPL and buying GME? Bagholders being born every minute. On the road today but hope we're back in the $140's at open.
today big green
"Will explode once ATH is reached. Earnings will prove APPL's value, $200 forward guidance."
"AAPL, AMZN and online retailers will thrive in 2021 and beyond. Everyone I know has one or more apple products and I see amazon delivery trucks everyday in my rural area (2-3 acre lots). The past year has truly been historical."
Own it. Don’t trade it. Just sit back and relax.
"We used own 6 aapl phone in my family, then we have switched to android a year ago, we all love Android"
"India, car, watch - glucose, iPhone sales records, batteries, all in a pandemic. Gonna be huge!"
"Guys, AH trades mean nothing. Volume is way too low. We will be big fat green end of week."
TSLA PE 1600!!!!! Apple PE is 40! Apple PE needs to grow to 100 at least with all the future products and EV. Apple will go to 5 trillions quickly! Probably 2 -3 years.
"I used to watch Apple and be concerned if it dipped... now after having some experience with it, I have decided that I really don’t care what it does on any given day because it’s an incredible stock. I can step away on a vacation and not worry about it because it’s such a good long term play. Own it! Don’t trade it!"
Way up after hours
Apple $150 Train is leaving the station. High Speed Rail. Get On.
My advice for what’s it’s worth...your portfolio only needs 2 stocks....AAPL for growth and ABBV for growth and dividends. Your % mix dependent on your age.
"It went down foe a week, it could very well creep up all week into earnings"
"After having a great Q reports MSFT green by $9.08, AAPL & undervalued AMD still in the red."
"Apple (AAPL) reported its Q1 2021 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, easily surpassing analysts’ expectations on the back of strong sales of its iPhone 12 line of smartphones.These are most important numbers from the report compared with what analysts were predicting.Revenue: $111.44 billion versus $103.12 billion expectedEarnings per share: $1.68 versus $1.42 expectediPhone revenue: $65.68 billion versus $60.33 billion expectedService revenue: $15.76 versus $14.89 billion expected"
great earning folks ! a very uppy uppy day tomorrow. Just bought more today. I aint kidding! A up up up day tomorrow. Thanko
Apple in a perfect cup and handle!!!!!
Apple to $200! Strong year ahead and analysts pumped about the stock.
That's $AAPL. Bad market tomorrow. Never know. I like day trading better. No stock is too good to sell.
Remember last wk all the political noise here. Where did they go? All selling their shares . Gonna crash the stock. Lol They all bought back from fomo.
"Muted DM, the board feels better already."
If you haven't gotten in to #NOK nokia 3 am isn't too late. It's going to blow up tomorrow.
"You can have hundreds of opinions pro and con, but history is undeniable in the fact that AAPL longs have profited greatly, and in my humble opinion will continue to do so. Stay long and be rewarded."
Apple revenue 2018 260mTrailing 4q 270m Market cap 2.4T is the poster child of the all time high market cap to gdp ratio
Apple crushed it. No worries. Happy days ahead.
Earnings Report will be a blowout!
"I'm no expert so I defer to those who are: since I heard President Biden promise to raise taxes if elected, what do you think the capital gains tax will be in 2021?"
With this volume we may see 160 before earnings are announced.
AllMajor analysts have AppleAt $150-$175 /share range
Bought 100 @ 130.24
Buy Buy Buy !
Buy more Apple shares hey people SRNE Pharma is booming right now the price is 9.55 analyst price target yesterday upgraded to $35
"Apple market cap is a bubbleApple is the reason market cap to gdp is at all time highGM will be selling millions of EV fleet, cars, and trucks with king of cloud and software Microsoft."
Let’s start buying Apple like GME!!!
"I believe there are clowns selling appl to buy GME, they will pay the piper. Thumbs up if you believe this is possible!"
"APPL makes a profit and pays their debts is what I like about owning AAPL. A few years ago one of my competitor's did 10-15 times the business that I did but in a short while they were in bankruptcy, but I was making profits and paying my bills."
is now a good time to buy?
"I can explain, after selling shares yesterdayI own 2 of the Feb 19, 130 call optionsThis is holding down the stock.I control the price of AAPL from my house with $2000 worth of calls.The price is now capped until Feb 19 at 142 - it can not and will not rise above that level"
"Holding 1/29, 135's Calls. How do I excersize??"
It’s the big boys driving this down before earnings. So they can buy back cheap. I’ve seen this before
think stock will double this year?
This is a gift as I bought today at $131 and will ride this up and up. I like to see days like this so I can add to my very long position and just smile as the $ come rolling in. As time goes forward so does the Apple share price. If it drops again on Monday I will buy more. Apple is the closest thing to being a long term sure thing than there is in the market for the past 10 years.
any info on aaple car during ER ?? Why nobody talking about it. ?
"Apple is headed to $100, where it belongs. Don't by Apple stock. Buy a Mac instead."
I keep forgetting...Apple doesn’t actually report until 1:30pm EST...? I want to avoid all the message board nonsense prior to the actual numbers getting released.
Bought the dip today. with this company I've learned you buy every dip.I'm in this via FNGU. can't get enough of the run ups
"call is starting, will end green"
price upgrades. $150-180
"buying opportunity, remember when the world's 5th richest man named apple his biggest competitor a day ago?"

Perhaps the investors that believe the market is open tomorrow should eventually consider moving their investment money into a managed target fund. Looking forward to Apple’s conference call on the 27th. The AirTags sound interesting; hope we get some info during the March event. Good luck & great investing!
"This board is a hoot today. If you’re long, you’re not worried at all because today means nothing. Earnings will be great and that and positive guidance is all that is needed."
Anyone else sick and tired of this GameStop story manipulating the news?
"No need to panic, let the shorts leave and we will pick up the money end of today/tomorrow"
"About 4:35 Apple have will AMAZING earnings ..... Then ... Everyone will start running their months ... It will go up about 15 bucks , then 7 , then 12 , then 5 , then 12 again . Watch"
... and”hedge funds” is the scapegoat phrase of the day once again on this message board. Lots of novices need a boogeyman to make sense of things.
Never trade apple 
It’s green wow
I don't understand the huge swing in share price ??? was it just taking profit ?
Just bought a lot
expect $158 tomorrow!
Ok peoples. I expected this stock to go up with such a great report.why isn't it?
Cramer has some influence on traders that watch his show but you think warren buffet listens? NO!
Should I buy Apple pre earnings or wait till after they report? Will Apple be able to meet the high expectations of investors?
unreal earnings and revenues!!
I cant remember last time I saw a 3 dollar move in premarket... and just imagine if it beat earnings and give good guidance. This may go over 170 in 2 weeks. And 200 by december.
"So, Apple goes down with blowout earnings across the board but Game stop rockets higher for absolutely no reason whatsoever."
"If there’s enough retail bullish pre-ER momentum on Friday, then the usual weekly big money opex manipulation could fail and actually backfire into a squeeze sending price even higher"
Unbelievable price. I added to my position. Will be $200 this year.
"Earnings coming, we will hopefully see a pre-earning rally next week or one following the good earnings report. I am not worried, nor should you be."
The retail investors will run this up like GME
big traders playing after hours ... low insignificant volumes to make us retail investors believe something is wrong and then we sell they buy at discount..................HOLD
"Long. My average is 120, I’ll load up more if it goes below that. I’ve actually added some above that and I rarely add any at a higher rate."
"Analysts saying last Q revenue could be $112 Billion...that would break the all time record over 2019 Dec....if that happens, see you at $200 instantly"

earnings not matter anymore. look Microsoft . RED :)
how much higher will this thing go? I just bought today so im hoping it doesnt crash lol
DOW & S&P just went positive NASDAQ isn’t that far off of going positive hopefully we see a reversal of yesterday
Diversity is more important than hiring the most qualified. Like getting into UCLA.
Ill be happy if we can close above 139 today
Dividend day= 02/05/2021
Looks like Apple will creep up form here. Dow is almost green. We might have a Green Day all around.
Doesn’t matter. It’s gonna crash into close. Bank it.
"Looks like Apple getting a bump from MFST crushing earnings. I'm not sure if there is a correlation, but if there is...this is going to be a good week."
looks like it will turn out to be a green day after a small sell off at the open. then the buyers will come in. multiple price target increases this morning. good for the stock
160 plus after earning ..undervalued.
Big ups today.
Most of the stocks are tanking today; hold on and don't panic.
This thing has had a great run up and some traders are taking profits. Don’t panic. It will probably end up in the green by the close
"We are living in the upside down of misinfo from every angle!Farcebook's Suckerberg calls out Apple as ""one of it's biggest competitors"" ""prioritizes it's competitive interests over user privacy"" Wait. didn't marky pay the FTC $5 Billion to settle?

Institution investor￼ are buying slowly before earning. Hold your share 150+ after earning.
"down $2-3, why should anyone complain? that's nearly the average move apple makes in a day. up we long"
Tomorrow will be interesting.after hours volume was almost 20 million. I read some one posted a few hundred thousand.People need to post facts.Good Luck
glad I got in before earnings
Ongoing AAPL rally justified in spectacular fashion yesterday and resumes today...
debating buying 175K worth of Apple.......
Apple shares by next Friday will be around $146. So keep positive and come back next Friday here
"Ha... called it. Just like that much higher we go! The most profitable and well run company in the world, hands down."
"I had a dream AAPL was flirting around 200 on this Q. Also my machine learning says to buy LMT, CRM and MCD tomorrow. These 3 will outperform AAPL to correction territory this week. LMT at 300 on Tuesday. CRM at 240 by Friday. MCD at 230-240 by Wednesday. Enjoy..I have cash reserve to buy these 4 at any given healthy pullback"
"I will buy more. My first larger purchase was at $108, feels like an eternity ago. Killed it!"
Breaking 144$ before noon?
"Take the opportunity to buy more semiconductors today as well. There is a severe shortage of chips/semiconductors in the world according to an article in a Chinese daily a short while back that’s because its expanded use in computers, robots, autos, I-phones , graphics, simulations , artificial intelligence, Cloud Computing and Hallographic technology etc etc etc"
China is going to treat AAPL like how US treats HUAWEI
John it’s already deleted. This page deletes all negative posts on sleepy joe.
$162 after hours
This will fly to $300 plus by the $AAPL news soon $NIO
Whoever is selling Apple shares right now are most likely hedge funds liquidating shares to pay for AMC and GME.
Boom
"So much activity in GME and AMC, Apple ER will be overlooked. I'm long AAPL but good lord, check out the volume on those 2."
I don’t understand this
I commend the longs for not panic selling.
Ready 4 Wednesday shorts? Make sure 2 cover!
170 tomorrow AH
What is going on? I thought we would be in $140 already!
Just watch. This will be much higher tomorrow into close on Friday. They blew their numbers away on every aspect. Own it don’t trade it. This qtr validates this company will be the first 3 trillion valued co.
"Apple is top-notch stock, will recover and go up. Apple is one of the best stocks in the market and made over $100 billion in one quarter, no one close to Apple stock. Stay long."
"The new admin speaks for the first time and look what happens. Now remember who you voted for, still happy?"
Microsoft up big after hours. Apple is getting a lift from it. Tomorrow should be an excellent day
"I checked with an attorney and the civil liberties complaint or Revocation of Parler rights to its app does not apply. In short freedom of speech restictions only apply to Government.NEXTAs a shareholder, I am sending a letter to Tim Cook that I have shareholders vote on a proposal to restore the Parler app to its store, Shareholders have a say at the annual meeting. Look for the proposal on the proxy page if you are a shareholder PLEASE VOTE WITH ME...or Buy ! share so you can vote."
"alright to all the noobs talking about selling, we are seeing a market correction, has nothing to do with apple. apple has never disappointed with earnings and the outlook is fantastic. if you cant take a 2 or even 10% loss, get the hell out of the stock market"
"The volume is low. Not many sellers, price will keep going up. The dips are over, time for the longs to cash in!!"
Some joker said Apple was down after hours. So I looked up and it is down 9 cents . That’s down? I then did an experiment. I took my big back side up from my sofa and looked around for pennies and guess what I found 17 cents. I need at least 50 cents to buy a bag of chips. So 9 cents is immaterial and carries no weight or bearings but the little rabbit  who reported Apple bring down after hours caused me some anxiety which was utterly unfounded
"Gene Munster if Piper Jaff...sees Apple at $200. Well, of course, Gene! This quarter’s earnings will knock its out of the park. Be prepared! LONG!"
"sell the News Day, hopefully a bear trap, but the way closed it seems like test of 130 first before any chance of touching 140 again"

Objective analysis indicate AAPL will go much higher, buying more on Monday. “Buy it don’t trade it” will make you rich without RISK...IT REARLY WORKS! Tim Cook and AAPL are the best of the best. Thank you Tim Cook for keeping AAPL # 1. Great # GLTA"
Did you know you can buy apple phone at Costco and get 90’days refund. . If we all do that. What will happen to the earnings.
Have a nice day.
Positive day today and a great short covering
I still agree with the forecast of 192$ target
"once I get to the office in the morning. i will send to my group an an email to buy AAPL in pre market as well. This price is the deal of the year. it's just a matter of time it will break 150 in blink of an eye. 200 is coming in this Q1. covid cases is dropping. In the west nom death today. Apple stores will open soon. The truth will prevail, Esp/revenues are truth and correction will send to 200 at least. Dividends are good while I am waiting for price to break 200 in Feb."
"You really want to sell it 5+ dollars discount AH, with the best earnings ever...LOL...Impatient..never learn"
So is it likely to blame the market being down plus other stocks including AAPL on Hedge fund people. Selling and taking cash.
Markets are not convinced!The Jan 29 $130 call sells for $13.95 yet the $135 call sells for $9.99...Subtract the $135 premium from the $130 premium you only get $4 on a $5 spread.If this was a slam dunk this spread would not be 20%
140 Today?
Lots of speculation about what would trigger the next major market crash. Look no further than the White House for your answer. Good luck.
"Did my morning constitutional, took me a shower, then cracked open the iPad to find this pleasant premarket recovery! Big ups today m-effers, big ups!"
Next Monday the rally starts!
Compared to $AAPL Microsoft is undervalued. Wouldn’t be surprised to see Microsoft play a little “catch up” with Apple this 
"There are some discussions in this forum about Apple pullback after Q3 earnings were released.2 factors:I - electionII - WS was disappointed that Apple delayed the release of 12; and the fact Cook did not give some type of guidance - Since when Cook gives guidance and discusses products under development? So weasels on WS punished the stock badly subsequently, and now they're buying them back and a few more before Q4 earnings.I believe this time is different, not only because we all know that Cook (not if but when) is going to come out sometime this year and announce the iCar (weasels don't want to miss out); but there are also rumors that they're looking to acquire some key Cos that would perfectly fit their products since they have tons of cash.Conclusion: depending on your financial situation, if you can then I would hold. If Gene Munster (he made many millionaires and billionaires in the Bay Area) believes that this will surpass 200, then, and based on what he has wizardly done previously, I'm banking on that it would blow the 200 to smithereens before the end of 2021."
all Apple does
Muhahaha! It’s creeping up shorts!
Congrats to all who bought and held through earnings.
"AAPL is always full of surprises. We know the earnings will be stellar.With this wonderful 5 day bump under our belt, are we at the point where the coming earnings factor is just about all 'baked in'?"
I was expecting much much much better.about 150 billion. This stock will sell of 80% tomorrow
Tony Balooga trimmed the shade tree today. And began loading the boat with LOTZ for 2021. It’s a newly trading car reselling company.. could be another Lithia Motors.
Good Morning! Looks like a nice day for Apple again.
A combination of profit takers and panic sellers. How long will this last?
just hedge funds selling to cover short losses
Apple will turn the market futures positive after the close....same old same old ...they always try to drive the markets down before good news
"I bought at 132$/share.. spent almost all my money. approx 100k. And it just going down all the time.. Thinking to sell it, coz this going down almost every single day."
Just saw $142.99 pre market
"AAPL is the most widely held stock in the market and is modestly tanking on decent numbers. Ummm, get a clue this market party is over. Look at the VIX for confirmation."
Maybe if Tim Cook changes the company's name to GameApple Stop then the share will rocket 200% in 2 days on practically zero profit earnings reports...!
Everyone should just relax and enjoy the dip. You know that long term Apple is the winner.
Market is overreacting to tepid news from the Fed. Down 2%. We're down 1%. Don't panic. This too shall pass.
This will hit 250$ 3/2021
AH volume is insane! Institutional Money swallowing shares!
Wont know until tomorrow 4pm where the share price settles.
"Okay, so when does Apple declare stock buy-backs of $500 Billion . . ."
"Does anybody have any reasons as to why Apple just keeps on giving longs blue balls?? I don’t get why Apple is still dropping? Earnings is so close, am I missing something? Was up pre market 1% and now we’re red again... I don’t see any reasons as to why??"
People are buying your shares at a 4% discount how nice of you.
WE WOKE... TWITTER GO BROKE!!!!!!!WHO'S NEXT $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL
Sold and bought Amazon... earnings and split next week time to actually make some money
Historical records point to $133 to $134+ as intra day high soon.This pre-makret dip is a good sign
"Almost only counts in playing horseshoes and grenades.While AAPL dipped into $126+ in after hours, today it looks to gap at open and run128.44 +1.30 (1.02%)Before hours: 7:42AM EST"
"The sobering reality: AAPL is a computer hardware manufacturer that derives 85% of revenues from phones, pads, and macbooks. Based on forward growth rates of 8-9%, it deserves about a 13 multiple. The stock is worth $56 right now."
target price raised to 170 everywhere will close positive bug time
"ooooff, that's a huge premarket for apple"
Hoping that I’m seeing the start of Tesla bubblers realizing how lucky they were and now deciding to park their lucky gains in Apple.
"Get ready for 10.00 a gallon gasoline. The nut case signing all the executive orders that he hasn’t even read is about to bankrupt America. These executive orders are coming from the squad, Pelosi and Harris. You’ll be selling shares of apple just so you can fill your tank."
Honestly i see Apple dropping to around $100-110 before it goes back up. Look at the history of the stock.
If you believe in the company you wouldn’t be complaining rn
Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives today's Bull case AAPL price Target in 12 months : $225 ! FYI
All you need to know about investing is Tim Cook & AAPL. Today is another big day for AAPL. GLTA
"Apple hasn't moved since the split over Labor Day weekend. It's gone 5 months and hasn't gotten past the split # of about 135. Everyone wants to talk about the 1 year growth, who cares it was all hype do to the split. Now we NEED HUGH EARNINGS to get this to 150. Five months is a long time to tread water. Comments please"
I wont buy in to a company who supports radical ideas..
Apple should be at least $160 now!
"The chip sector is hot. Just imagine a chip /semiconductor in everything we use. Planes, cars, ships, I-phones , military use , satellite, robots, microwaves, computers, refrigerators, air conditioners, GPS and I can go on and on such as graphics and designing new systems, health management etc etc surgeries, prescription filling an diagnostic and running the electronic system in health care. Wow what a future technology has. I don’t know if I believe in UFOS but according to the people who do we have only scratched 1/million of the technology progress and potential outreaches"
They keep selling I keep buying. Gives me that tickley feeling down there!!
Buddy says he's waiting for 125. 00 to move in. I said no chance.
"This stock has pretty much had positive momentum forThe last 5 years after earnings for this quarter. I don’t see any selling happening after earnings release, at least not enough to lower the SP."
tommorow 140
"Still a lot of shorts that need to cover, hence the bashing going on they are just trying to drive the price down! Take advantage of these dips and buy because once tomorrow hits she is going to run!"
it will turn arround for the legit stocksrobinhood is removing one stock after other from tiktok investors
We are only 3% off the ATH. Patience is a virtue!
"AOC and Harris are planning on taxing your 401K as if it was realized capital gains.Then later down the road, confiscating it as reparations."
"Well well well, BLM activist arrested for participating in the riot at the Capital, guess cumala will have to start a fund to bail them out."
Well this week certainly didn’t go as planned. I still love my Apple and will hold on for another ten years plus. Great company with so much promise.
"Every one just relax, AAPL will do what we longs all hope for. AAPL will not disappoint,"
"The all time high was $138 followed four days later with a $12 dip to $126+.Then it pivoted to $134+. Last year in Jan 20 AAPL rallied strong $80+ ( $32 pre split) coming out of the box only to dip in Feb to $53 ($212 pre-split)). Now,,,$127+My point?Both times people muscled the stock and it did not workThese mini ""V's"" accomplish so much more w/o hurting people. IT gives new investors a discount price and algorithim players a chance to do what they do best.People whom stayed long had the last laugh!Have anice day"
"AAPL is above the market. Notice how manipulation is working in long’s favor today, keeping price steady around 129"
why is whole market tanking now?
Bought the dip!heading over to AMC see if I can add more to aapl today!
"AAPL will pivot, as it always does, then run to new all time highs"
no doubt the stock will be 140 or so on earnings date...just buy and relax from here until next Thursday...I think some big gains are coming after this ER
"Today over 150. And after reporting, hit 160"
7 out of the first 10 post are about politics. It’s getting old. It’s over. This is about aapl.
apple never stresses me. it's like a good friend. we can be mad at each other but we're still cool.
"Before earning, at 140. After earning 150 or more. Hold tight"
"Why is this down ., while the whole stock market is up ? I swear my luck and my options trading whatever I do goes south"
Could it be one of those 6% + days?
This will continue until the GameStop mania comes back to earth.
Took some of profits from plug and fcel to roll them into aapl. My safe harbor.
I’m bullish on Apple so I have increased my position before earnings :)
New records are coming
Terrific results. Solid quarter and greatly positioned for the future.
"Looking back on the last 4 earnings release, only one time was there a slight pullback the next day. I think it was April’s. Very slight, the other 3 were up the next day by 3-9%. So I’m thinking $148-$150 at closing bell Wednesday and a $158 close next Thursday."
Apple EV could give Tesla a Run for its Money...
Guess who profits from the keystone pipeline shut down....Warren Buffet.Do your research..
Here we go. CNBC says minorities should get preference in vaccinations.The media has gone off the rails.
Aloe vera speech is coming later today from Powell to cool off everyone's anxiety so be patient and sit tight!!
I think we should book profits tomorrow. Post earnings you never know what’s coming
"Apple up the dividend!!! 400% UPSIDE, note the video presentation viewed by 60,000 viewers so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxEFekPUuqU&feature=youtu.be$twtr $FB do the right thing, America 1st"
probably will go sideways tomorrow so remaining calls will expire worthless..hopefully next week will show earnings gains
"Numbers talk!Yesterday, pre-market, WE discussed how the Jan 29 $5 call spread between $135 and $130 was $4...20% risk. Yet AAPl was trading in low $150's at that time.WE concluded the markets were not convinced of a rally after earnings. Based on that observation, we did warn about options.Last night AAPL's low was $136."
Jack Dorsey really SCREWED shareholders BIGLY with his little tweet rampage yesterday! I’m not Dem or Repub but after his admission yesterday that Twitter has too much power I definitely SOLD MY SHARES THIS MORNING!$FB $AAPL $SNAP $AMZN
I thing the whole GME thing will teach short sellers a lesson. This will be good for true investors.
alert: let's start the big buying here plus the buybacks
"139+ close today, new highs next week in 150's"
"Are earnings priced in? Only been an investor for a couple of years and i've noticed 99% of the time we see a sell off after good or bad earning. I don't really care as i'm long, but what are peoples guesses?"
Hoping for a dividend boost and a ton of share buyback. 
"Sorry bulls on the little people boards (like Yahoo Finance). If you watch the Bloomberg messenger boards...big boys tam e on appl for now. Yes, phenomenal company, it's just if you think it's rallying above 135 into earnings...good luck, cause the smart money thinks you are wrong (and will be happy to use giddy Vega and Theta to take your money in the options market...beyond just a naked short). Good luck to all longs...just tread cautiously. NUMBERS MATTER."
Still 2 full days to earnings reporting Jan 27. after market closes. Good Luck
over time--i've been long & i've sold---long was much better
Do they report pre market or after market tomorrow?
150$ after earnings...
The P/E argument?After earnings the pros on CNBC said they could not find one thing wrong with the earnings report except with the Forward P/E at 32 that was rich for AAPL.WE made that argument in Jan 20 and earlier this year also after it first ran to $138.BUt the P?E will fall with great earnings and stock buybacks. But this takes time.Last night the Jan 22 $135 calls closed at $22 to $24 . Shareholders if they need cash may want to sell a covered call for Jan 22. THis puts tax deferred cash in your pockets until you close out the trade or the stock is taken from you. Your stock giveaway would be the strike price + premium of sold call. For example $135 + $24 = $159
Days like this is what separates the men from boys
30 sec.....
"This week I took photos of option prices throughout the day for Jan 22 optionsWhile it was posted AAPL would run going into earnings and AAPL has shown four now five times the bounce off of $126 to $`131+ as high as $138.94l these trades were so obviousJan 22 $130,,, Tuesday close... .65...Yesterday's close...$6,95Jan 22 $135 ...Tuesday close... .09...Yesterday's close...$2,25the $130 call was obvious the $135 call was a surprise.The return was even higher for AAPL dipped to $126 on Tuesday amMy point?When everyone goes the same way' people do well.It was posted last WEekend it is the investors' time this time going into earnings.It is only fair"
Foxcon Decemeber Revenues exceed expectation due to high iPhone 12 demand !
From when did you need to buy the stocks to be eligible for the dividends??
Apple will not go over 142 before Friday at 4 PM that’s option expiration those 142.00 calls will not be in the money. If you know anything about options.. Much good news this morning and did not affect the price going up. ￼142.00 a bunch of good news this morning it’s all about options expire Friday for Apple will Go. over 145 next week￼
"Strong Buy,Strong Buy,Strong Buy at this current very very low price because very soon It's going to be $200 plus. (very very strong buy)"

Earning report tommorow will be green?
"True market manipulation by WS - sell it and watch for weak hands, then buy it again low. It is always done on AAPL. A company that blew all UNREASONABLE high expectations; and yet got rewarded by hammering its stock."
cup and handle formation here to rocket to 160!
I will not be selling my shares . Hang in for another day - like tomorrow maybe .
People are complaining about no guidance. How can you do it with uncertainties? We didn’t provide any guidance last quarter why now? The results would be the same. Beat! Beat! Beat!
"The motto here is ""Everyone wets their beak.""Last month it has been a traders sandbox. Earlier I showed the four pyramids with $136 being the ""line in the sand"" With earnings on 1/27 after the close, this week may follow a different script. There may be a steady run-up into 1/27.Just a hunch"
$150 today
AAPL is going over 160 on ER. GUARANTEED.
Shorts headed for a lump on the head over the next 24 hours.
AAPL is in rally mode
This company is a powerhouse.

How come we are down $10 from the all time high with the best quarter ever during a pandemic ?
Sold my remaining shares at $139. Might get back in tomorrow if it dips to $135. I love Apple but i'm so tired of this stock its been stagnant for 7 months. I'll buy back in tomorrow at $135
"Shorts are starting to panic and their posts are getting more desperate. I thought this stock was going to take a bit of a dip before going up, but it looks like it might explode today."
This will be a record high earnings in apples history! Prepare for takeoff!

"Tim Cook says there’s a big announcement coming tomorrow, stay tuned. "
Looks like this historic record quarter reality is starting to set in. In a few short trading days getting AAPL under $150 will seem like a dream.
Cup -n -handle formation is the most bullish of chart patterns. We Got it... The right side of the handle to form as we get closer to earnings. $138 by next Wednesday
Earnings on the 26th will be with the iPhone 12 for the first time. I expect a blowout Q.
The economy is not going to prosper under the new administration. Mark my words. He’s already caused the loss of 10’s of thousands of jobs.
Here is a positive injection. AAPL will be in the positive at closing today.
"If someone wins the Mega Million lottery for $1 billion, should he invest half his winnings in Apple? Asking for a friend."
Apple  will rollercoaster all day until earnings. Then blowout to the upside
I need some honest advice. I am very inexperienced at buying stocks. Decided I would invest families Christmas money in stocks instead of putting in bank account. Is this a good time to buy Apple stocks?
"Give it up shorties, I know you are lurking around. Not tonight and Not tomorrow, this is a well deserved party to longs!"
Back to the $140s. Just be patient
160 pretty soon
The big green wave about to start into earnings
The road to $200

"$175 by April folks...im adding whenever i can, even if its only a few shares at a time. Build up, hold for 10 years, be rewarded!"
I will never sell my AAPL but we are only up $6.00 from post split. Hoping we recover next week.
Last day to load .
WOW!! Blow out numbers!!
AAPL to the moon baby!!
"Ah, have to fight the broader market so gains might be muted, but as anyone who follows the Apple today's price is pretty irrelevant to how the market reacts to the earnings. We'll only know that tomorrow, and even that is just short term noise."
13 points is all we get for 7 months You make billions
"Every time the market drops, ask yourself. Has Apple's fundamentals changed? No they have not. Is Apple still a great company managed by great people? Yes it is. Will Apple continue to make money in the future? Yes it will. So when I see selloffs I see opportunity. Consider buying the dips. Your future self will thank you further down the line. Own it don't trade it. I'm still accumulating."
"Apple has never released any information about its AR glasses devices, but according to relevant patent information leaked by Apple, and apple's frequent acquisition of AR technology-related companies, it has become an open secret in the industry that Apple is developing an AR glasses device."
Another earnings with minimal movement after hours after great results
"It’s going to be OK. This is such a solid stock and although the fall wasn’t really expected, this will bounce back. I’m sure there’s a WS play behind the scenes bringing it down."
MARKET SELLOFF
Apple opened lower in Frankfurt but getting back close to 139 ish at this time
building business and iphone sales in India....can't wait until these sales start to kick in next quarter..i look forward to next quarter projections on earnings release tomorrow!!!
"i see that AAPL. , TSLA stocks are the most short selling stocks , how could be with their record earning , i am not good at understanding any of this , can any one explain at least for AAPL only"
apple product is loved by young people. apple stock is loved by old people.
Will load up more on Monday. This whole GameStop sheet will end and everyone will buy Apple at a discount. Apple will run up to $150-$170 February
AAPL breaks out of the handle yesterday and already back tested point of breakout and resumed higher highs and closed green on big volume. Buying dip. Lets see some follow through today. Good Luck
Still loving the low volume. Lots of people holding is going to drive this way up on earnings.
"$144+ has printed twice as an intra day highJan 27, 2021... 143.43... 144.30... 140.41... 142.06... 142.06... 139,236,700Jan 26, 2021... 143.60... 144.30... 141.37... 143.16... 143.16"
Typical Robinhooder trying to process what just happened- 
A very simple rule of thumb and an enjoyable exercise. On a by-weekly chart you will find that AAPL gains will out pace losses on a 70-30% bases on average. So stay long relax enjoy the ride and enjoy and appreciate your profits with peace of mind.
Remember if CANOO is rejecting $AAPL means it is something bigger than $AAPL
I’m a patient guy but the fact that the stock isn’t able to hold gains let alone get out of a trading range is very frustrating
Apple is gonna do really well this quarter cuz everyone needs more tech during the pandemic
@Anonymous said $120 tomorrow for Apple. everyone keep in mind of this and let's all enjoy bashing him tomorrow when he's wrong
"Big green day, this whole market is a bear trap"
The big funds always need AAPL .. so why sell to them cheap?
Big bounce coming on Monday.
"as i said, apple numbers never disappoint. future looks fantastic. all i need to know. goodnight everyone."
Tomorrow Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday day after earnings up early than profit takers come in but still closes . Friday more profit takers but will close the week  and at $148.
Yup upgrades and increased price targets tomorrow...then all eyes turn to Apple Car
Looks like the green new deal is being administered through executive orders and kick back Joe just keeps blindly signing away our economy and freedom.
"It's nice to see the Apple shares in my portfolio shoulder the burden for once. Ever since the split last August, my Tesla shares have had to shoulder the burden for providing capital gains for my portfolio. My Apple & Amazon shares have been in hibernation for 5 freaking months!"
Tomorrow's the BIG DAY! I know you guys are excited. Good luck to all Apple longs and new investors and.... let's goooooooo Apple!
"Over 7.1M shares traded, expect a big push in the last hour."
Apple I car announcement will send this to the moon. It will happen. Hold longs!!!
 if you think the stock will explode after earnings.  if you think it will drop
"Apple's iPhone 12 sales exceed Wedbush's 'bull case scenario,' expected to boost stockSales of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 12 have exceeded Wedbush's ""bull case scenario"" for fiscal 2021, based on Asia supply chain checks, and should boost shares with December results coming shortly, analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Thursday. ""We believe Apple saw a robust Christmas/holiday season not just on iPhones, but also had a strong AirPods performance that will be another product tailwind heading into 2021 for Cook & Co,"" Ives wrote. Asia checks suggest the supply chain is expecting low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds for the quarter, comfortably ahead of the 80 million to mid 80s range expected in mid December, 75 million expected in late October and 65 million to 70 million range expected three months ago, he wrote. ""This is roughly a 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts. For the March quarter we believe builds for total iPhones ticked up again another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60 million to 70 million range. For the June quarter we believe initial builds are in the low 40 million range with potentially an upward bias. We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis,"" said Ives. The Wall Street consensus is for 217 million iPhone unit sales in fiscal 2021, but Wedbush sees potential for up to 240 million units, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in FY15. Importantly, with our estimation that 350 million of 950 million iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, we believe this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for Cook & Co.,"" said Ives. Wedbush rates Apple as outperform with a $160 12-month price target and a bull case target of $200. Apple shares were up 0.5% premarket and have gained 82% in 2020, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.24% has gained 6.6% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.13% has gained 15.5%."
"So many disappointing comments on here even from some of the long term holders, relax please.Apple is going to be fine, don’t give up so easy, if u have been in the stock long enough you know in 6 months it will be higher and 1 year even higher and so on!"
It's not automatic to buy this stock at it's high right before earnings report...
Lovin’ it!
best sales in india and china. best quarter ever. 23 +% of worlds iphone share. only way but up.
European stocks are up which usually is a good sign
Happy earnings eve apple fam 
Don’t be shaken by after hours ! When the normal people with functional intellects get to trade we will see fair price discovery 
Foldable screens coming next ! Better buy now !! It will skyrocket to 150 easy ...
Sell off in February means Exactly That !Stay cautious !
The market is a very strange- earnings & numbers mean nothing-highly manipulated
Wedbush on Seeking Alpha see's 225.00 price target for Apple! Woo!
What target price should I expect after earnings report?
"whatever is going on right now is due to shorts selling, report isn't even out. ignore everyone who says they missed"
I was told this would go to $160 lol
Say goodbye to the $130s

"Come guys, keep buying.Earnings day is right around the corner"
consistency... a small dividend... a moat... and a must-have iPhone familial relationship... AAPL seems like a very profitable utility company... in perpetuity
"It’s options Friday, that y Apple is down, and in the long run Apple will go up, as lot of analysts have upgraded their price target for Apple after the earning reports."
A great buying opportunity today before market open ...this bargain low price won't last long ...buy more on the dip
Unless there is total upheaval on Wednesday which I do doubt AAPL will do just fine. Conservatively AAPL should close January $133-135. And have a stellar February.
"Great news= Apple CFO Tim Cook says Parler could return to App Store “if they get their moderation together “. Business insider January 17, 2021 by Tim Levin"
I think market be volatile until new government sworn in that is Jan 20th and positive outlook for Q1 earnings (Jan 27th) will keep $aapl stock start attracting big guys. So we could expect upside from Jan 20th.
Buy Apple it’s giving you a entry point Buy Now !
Until the election results are corrected the stock market will continue to slide! Long time stock holder with buy order in at 120.
"I lost $13k today in apple, but I have the faith in apple. if we all hold on and don't panic it will go up and double this year even Tesla got the wrath of kraken today."
Not to worry. New Revised PTs should be expected which will boost the price. AAPL may buy back!
market due for correction.. 7-10%. load up on dip
"What a great ""Community"" WE have here.The Investors have the field until AFTER earnings."
"It appears as though IBM and Intel are in Wall Street's doghouse so maybe those dumping investors will take a longer look at Apple. One can only hope.Intel looks to be on a slippery slope if they have to compete with TSMC and AMD. Intel's new CEO is making some bold claims about turning things around but that won't come overnight. Intel has been falling out of favor for a few years with their inability to fab at smaller chip nodes. Intel isn't going out of business but is no longer on the cutting edge of fabrication. Having to ask TSMC for chip fab help doesn't bode well for Intel.Intel's new CEO doesn't want some rookie company like Apple showing them up in chip design, so the fight is on. Talk is cheap. Apple has been designing ARM chips for a decade, so Apple is up to the task. When Apple's base M1 CPU is giving an i9 fits, I think Intel is going to have to go back to the drawing board."
AAPL futures skyrocketing in anticipation of blowout earnings...after 5mo the beast has awakened...release the kraken

It was 145 AH yesterday but opened at 143. It’ll be 143 AH today and open at 150 tomorrow 
MSFT rallied this morning right into end of day for their earnings report. Tomorrow lets see AAPL do the same. Good Luck
$170 folks!!
"I get a laugh at some of you fools taking victory laps. Any real investor knows and expected this could happen at earnings. If you simpletons took a few minutes to digest the ER, you'd know Apple is here to stay and is only getting better. They blew it out the water. Who cares if a few day trading robinhooders are taking their $200 profits"
it's time to see lift off

"wishing everybody luck tomorrow..., this needs to move..."
Short sellers are piling onto apple because its the only company with a market cap large enough to protect them from WSB =D
Nice to see everyone in a good mood. What’s no to like?
Samsung news will benefit AAPL and push the stock back to ATH before ER
wait i am confused were suppose to buy this instead of GME or AMC ? isn't this detached from any real fundamentals on its price?
Just remember history dictates that Apple may pop after earnings but it will take a drastic hit like 30% if the market corrects 10% in March. And that will be just another buying opportunity. Never sell Apple unless you need money from your retirement funds or brokerage account. Always reinvest your divi on pullbacks.
"hold on to apple, $150 next"
"What you need to understand is that apple is NOT a bubble, its a $111B maker per quarter actually, whereas tesla makes peanutes compared to its market cap, which is a bubble btw. Dont compare the two!! Never."
The way this market is...AAPL will be $300 by mid Feb....you know stimulus checks went to IPhones LOL
I'm not a technical guy. I have learned a bit about financials from reading the intelligent investor. all I know is I couldn't buy an iphone 12 at best buy and the sales staff told me to try my luck in 2 weeks because they come in and then they are gone.
"So Tim Cook will make an ""exciting"" announcement tomorrow which is not a product. I'd hate to kill the hype that all of you are anitcipating, but I don't think it's Project Titan. It could be confirmation of the record setting App Store sales this past holiday, or the new stores they've opened up in other countries."
Don't be fooled with a head fake...Wait for the EOD selloff
Thinking of selling my AMZN shares and buy AAPL leading up to AAPL earnings then selling on the news and putting money back to AMZN for their Feb 2 earning release. Sensible?
If only poor people around the world had invested in Apple just 10 years ago.
Apple fixing to break out with strong earnings from sales coming soon.
better hurry!sell $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL TWTR
Green Apples taste the best
everyone getting a great buying opportunity this morning....take advantage
"No way I’m letting my 10,000 shares go before earnings!"
watch out 140 is coming
Oh ya also for those who sold don’t forget to set aside 35% of those short term earnings for both the fed and state tax guys....

"Don’t forget today is month end because January 31, is a Sunday. Big money pouring into the stock market fromIRA, Pension plans, 401k and 403b plans for February 2021 today"
Nice discount if it drops when market open  buy the fear always do not buy the rally  sell the rally but Apple did not even rally
Lets pray for a good earning and hope that will push to 140.
don't worry think I'm going to. sleep
Upgrade: Wedbush Dan Ives Upgrades AAPL to $175. Good Luck
Thank you to ever sold. I got back in apple for a great price
"CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 first quarter ended December 26, 2020. The Company posted all-time record revenue of $111.4 billion, up 21 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.68, up 35 percent. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue."
I have a feeling price is set in already
"Oh good, I was worried I had missed the boat but now I can get on board at 130! This is why pullbacks are healthy : )"
"Mr Powell hasn’t said a single word that wasn’t already known. Call it what you want, this is profit taking."
question will you sell now pay tax on short term gains or hold an chance the stock dropping??
"Rob Arnott, founder and CEO of giant investment advisor Research Affiliates, his funds is north of $145B spoke today regarding Tesla and Apple stocks. Read his analysis posted in Yahoo finance""Tesla stock is a prime example of a bubble: Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott""""Apple stock is not a bubble: Wall Street power playerResearch Affiliates' Rob Arnott""And here we are - even with the bullish calls by Rob Arnott (and he is a wizard on WS), Apple barely stayed in the green up .64; whereas Tesla is up 18.39. If this doesn't show us the disconnection then I don't know what else can prove it."
This is going in the right direction
LiftOff tomorrow ? What say you ?
this will open green
180 by the end of week?
smart robinhooders who made a boatload this week will now choose real companies to park their money.... Apple is an excellent choice.
LETS GO!
THE BOOM IS UPON US. $aapl to $500
"So, why is AAPL up close to 3% in premarket?"
When they paying dividends? And how much? Own 1600 shares
Tried everything they could to drop it afterhours tomorrows low 934 am than the shorts cover and AApl finishes day at 145 upgrades galore
what a golden opportunity to buy more...started 20 years ago and havent sold a share...
Everything going so smoothly last few days. Why this plunge on the day we’ve waited for??? Booooo!
Today was a new closing high for Apple at 136.87. While the intraday high still stands at 138.79. Overall a nice day for Apple.
"When you buy AAPL it’s not an every day trading. I am long I am monitoring and up on all AAPL news, and so far it has been very profitable and enjoyable to have."
"“TSMC is to officially announce its finances in an earnings call on January 14.” Apple’s silicon manufacturer. Expecting blow out results, which should reflect in aapl price."
If Apple has blowout earnings what do you think it will do to the stock price today?? AH??
AH because of MSFT earnings I presume?
"If AAPL and FB gonna go down with this good of a beat, tomorrow gonna be one FUGLY day for stock market longs"
Evidently the science is saying open up everything since Joe has been installed.
Can anybody guess how high will Apple go next week and the week following that because results are going to be outstandingly great!
Zuckerberg must be well endowed to keep himself upright......cuz the dude has zero legs to stand on when it comes to privacy beef with Apple.
"""Apple Estimates Continue to Inch Higher, Driven By Strong iPhone 12 Demand""By Eric J. SavitzJan. 7, 2021 9:52 am ETEarlier this week, I took note of a couple of analyst notes looking ahead to Apple’s (ticker: AAPL) December-quarter financial results and lifting their estimates and price targets."" Good Luck"
"Last night ( Jan 28th California time ) I was showing my wife how to trade after hours on here brokerage account. As we were placing our order i noticed a 7,736,716 share @ $137.09 and I asked myself was that a hedge fund buying or selling ? Keep in mind that was a billion dollar transaction. After seeing what Aapl price did today, I am certain it was a buy."
Invest in companies that make profits and pay dividends.
Theres alot of posts here from older investors. Their not lying. This stock is the real thing if your younger buy n tuck away. Accumulate. It splits every so many yrs. thats where the money is made. Believe . Don’t daytrade and watch this everyday. It’s a keeper for ever. It goes up. it goes down. It sleeps then wakes up and goes up. Then it moves a alot at once. I think it always mostly beats the market but i might be wrong.
Apple 135 by 20th based on technical analysis and over 150 by earnings. Load up now.
"Futures down 165 and 77 thanks Joe keep those green executive orders coming, you can never lose enough jobs!"
I just found a sure fire way to keep Apple shares above $142. I went and put in a buy limit order for some Apple shares at $142. You know the Karma Gods conspire against you whenever you have a buy limit order pending. The shares you're looking to buy will never go down to the price that you want to buy at...!
A company with one product that tapped into the gullibility of people. So many other long term plays out there. Headed to 110
AAPL will be above 150 in January!all chipmakers are threatened by AAPL! All social media platforms and Ad industry are controlled by AAPL! AAPL is the king in both hardware and software!
"MM’s trying to get cheap shares, don’t panic sell. It will be regrettable."
"Long hold with AAPL for two years. Was first time position and it’s all part of a well balanced breakfast...I mean portfolio. Have I sold any, sure! And, then I bought in the dips. Yes, I might sell again to hold onto my earnings and then buy again in dips. That said, it’s not the alpha and omega of my portfolio."
"Apple reported per-share earnings of $1.68 and revenue of $111.44 billion.Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.42 a share on revenue of $103.27 billion, according to FactSet."
Don’t bet against America.
Looks like KIA wants AAPL for their EV solution. This make 2 big car markers now. AAPL is way under value since it is now an EV play as well. New target for for AAPL is $220
beat earning but still go down...why?????Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): FQ1 GAAP EPS of $1.68 beats by $0.27.
IF everyone who sold Jan 29 calls closed out their trades this would run
Apple may not be the newest spak or short get quick stock but if you want Solid growth you can't go wrong it has made my portfolio lots of $$$ hold long
"Great article in yahoo/finance dated January 20, 2021 by Brian Sozzi “how the stock market performed under Democratic Presidents”. Great article to read. Stock market does better under Democratic presidents than under the Republicans. I am fully 100% invested"
I got 50 % Apple 25% Microsoft 15% Visa 10% MasterCard.How is that ?
Last chance to buy before earnings. I see $147-$150 after earnings.
"People selling off now, this is going to tank big time. Hope I'm wrong have 1800 shares."
buy the dips
"$200 by year end given no major natural disasters or worldwide crisis. 5G phones are kicked in with new super cycle, this time services, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, Apple News, iCloud, and Apple TV. Just hold apple and don’t trade."
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD! These are suppose to be FREE MARKETS. What’s next?$TSLA $NIO $AAPL $LAZR $SBE $IPV $CCIV
"Wow. Dow is down almost 1,000 since Joey was inaugurated. Don't worry, only 4 more years of this."
Apple crushed it. Patience.
"Question.. Should I put a $140 limit sell on some shares in case the earnings report is whatever, or any other reason? I figure if it drops back down to $140, it's probably going lower and I can always buy shares back.."
"I think the market just wants to make a correction, no amount of blowout earnings are going to change that.That being said, MSFT and AAPL are good buys on a pull back."
end of day to closed at $146.
"AAPL is once again proving to be a disruptor. Love the new privacy feature and big middle digit to FB. I'm going on six months w/o social media. Don't miss it at all. Feeling happier & more connected. ...and to the Republic for which it stands, ONE nation, under GOD, indivisible, with liberty & justice for ALL. A bet against America has never gone well. Let's support what keeps us together & makes the world a better place while getting rich."
"anytime Apple is down, you buy. you know it will go up. market is just about money flow and which stocks are in the most ETFS. nothing to do with earnings or fundamentals."
Just stay long!
"After making $111 billion in one qrt, it lost more than that in market cap in 2 days. SMH."
"Last quarter, Apple posted net quarterly profit of $28.8 billion. That's $3.703 profit per second... each second..."
Alert: All the stocks that were up today will fall and AAPl will buck the trend and recovers all the losses. Thanks for trading accordingly
Yeehaw! This is getting good! Stay strong lads.
"pretty sure retailers will squeeze out AAPL institutions above 150 in pre market. Watch...Solid EPS/revenues command ...buy after hours, I bought mine at 136.76"
"The rise of Gamestop and AMC Entertainment shows what type of a market we're dealing with. If that stuff isn't gambling then I don't know what is. Those stocks are basically junk and no one should be buying them but they're making some people very rich, at least on paper. That's not investing and those stocks will probably drop rather quickly when whatever game is being played ends. Playing the market like a casino is quite foolish and it's rather dangerous if they're buying on margin. I'll just play it safe with Apple even if it takes longer to make gains."
Why is any body selling?
Looks like the weak stomached Apple share holders decided to sell & jump ship today. These people may make a couple of bucks in the short term BUT they will never get rich. To become a truly rich Apple millionaire you have to have a strong stomach & a willingness to hold your Apple shares for the long-term. You can't be jumping in & out of the market and sell your Apple shares every time your shares go up a little bit...
Blowout number on Housing Starts. The de facto number I always look at for a precursor on the economy. The Party continues and Apple soars compadres. Enjoy the ride up! 
"only hedge funds selling, not us"
"Oh my God what a great article in Bonzinga by Shanthi Rexalene the new word in the market “FANGMAN” which stands for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia"
"do your research before selling. PT of 155, earnings to surpass 100billion for the first time. google, research. this thing is going to run up to earnings this wednesday"
Wow hedge fund shorts are panicking!!...big boy heavyweights getting pummeled by middle weights....amazing!! GameStop and AMC etc..
"AAPL sold 18M iPhone 12 units in China market in Q4, exceeding expectations..breaking news an hour ago"
If they don’t talk about the car. Down goes apple. Still a great long hold.
What are the chances of “Gamestonk” happening to AAPL?
"This time last year, AAPL was $80 then dipped to $52 and is now $132.Throughout the year it had bigger dips then this week. Relax"
I say Green Close!
I gonna sell this thing! At $170 not $130
"Cramer himself admitted on CNBC that he’s “never seen the guns like this. They can break shorts.”Speaking of GME, AAPL about to do the same!"
"As I stated earlier in the day I expected a muted response. Great revenue & earnings. Some of that was baked in. Given a generally wobbly market sentiment its a hard environment for giant leaps. However, after the dust settles and people get real with the new Washington the money will flow back into stocks as there is simply no place else to get a return on investment."
apple now trading close to 10x revenue. not looking great
"Noticeds some BIG obvious AAPL wash trades recurring yesterday, for example 7,736,716 share @ $137.09 = $1B...those are blatant bear raiding wash trades to suppress AAPL’s price and overpower any upbidding...where shares ultimately go nowhere & wind up back in seller’s hands, and yet SEC does nothing—too weak or corrupt...yet even easy enough for me to figure out."
Shorts are toast tomorrow!
102-145 range patience it's going lower.
When the IMac with the M1 chip comes out im going to buy a 27 inch. Excited for that.
AAPL price movement is dictated by option trading in the near term.
Hate to do it but will sell my shares today. Will buy back when censoring stopped. Apply will be dead money for awhile anyway. Expect Hugh drop in market this spring when people realize how bad Dem policies are going to be for economy. Not leaving site through. Want to stay here just to bug Libs
"Grants for engineering programs, 100 new scholarships, and the launch of company’s first Apple Developer Academy in the U.S. in Detroit.This is a good thing."
Time to load back up long at around $125 according to the chart IMO
"Just bought some, long term I hope this works out"
You rake in 111 bil in a qtr and the hedgies come after you. Whatever. Not selling a single share.
"I'm not selling, I am buying"
"Sold my position 1,000 shares @ 135 broke even."
My primary portfolio made $79K for the week. My Amazon & Apple shares woke up from their 5-months hibernation and started shouldering the load of my portfolio and gave my Tesla shares a chance to rest.
The entire market experienced pull back on thursday and friday. I think we have a great set up for a green monday market wide and apple with ride along with that! I say 144 by EOD monday
"Nasdaq Composite is skyrocketing again, Despite Terrible $TSLA and $AAPL earnings."
"After Apple's report earnings a share price approx. $160+ will confirm the 5G and pent up demand evolving and existing in its current supercycle. Furthermore, the appears to be plenty of GameStop earnings to float to Apple becoming a more solid investment for those in the know."
Absolutely no doubt that this stock is set to reach 250$ and beyond.
What is my quarterly dividend amount on 40 shares $8 wow
Big hedge funds got they hands in this one trust me.
"Do we really think AAPL lost money behind GME, AMC, NOK, NAKD? I thought it was just hedge funds losing!"
150-160 after earning.
I recently sold a condo and put the entire $190k in appl at $128.80. 1475 shares. I guess my taxes will be covered for the sale by next year. Life is good
If you have $250K to invest would you put it all in APPL or invest separately diversifying?
It look like there is no recovery today. Market is down almost whole day. It’s sick.

"bought more shares on the way up, lets all get rich on this stock"
Hope Tim talks about the VR headset/glasses at the call.
when @Anonymous said $120 apple today
Apple is at the highest point  and it is still Low now.
Today AAPL's bonus package indicates AAPL's profits are well above projections for 2020
Should I buy Apple before the earrings report?
"AMD, MSFT, AAPL great Q reports, the herd got corral by Hedge funds............"
"will end at 139.99 tomorrow so everyone above 140 strikes will have their options exercised worthless...this is a perfect example of the rationale behind the GME AMC NOK frenzy...i am long AAPL stock and play with the options for a quick buck here and there so no real impact for me but, this is big manipulation nonetheless."
"For you younger investors, learn from my mistake. I bought 500 shares of AAPL in 2004 and sold them in 2008 after making $50K to build out my basement. Those shares if kept with splits would now be 28000 shares and $3.5M in value on an original $48K investment. If you are looking 10 years down the road, I would hold. If you want to be whining like me later on, go ahead and sell."
"All time high close today......,,Bullish"
"If this news doesn’t pop the stock eventually, nothing will! That cannot happen because the stock market is not gambling it is a legitimate business which many thrive on indefinitely"
this is happening because of big hedge funds there manipulating the the stock by selling millions of shares and then buying them back when there down 10 to 20 % don't be fooled by the we need to start a Reddit tread on Apple so the big hedge funds loss the billions instead of the small investor
"I’ve lost a few thousand today on this. I don’t care all that much as it will recover in time, but it can’t go without being said this is pure criminality once again by WS. Their over leveraged positions were exploited by some smart people on reddit and once again smart money is paying the price. Unbelievable"
I bought more at 132.14 what a good deal. Every 0.40 cent I am buying accumulating...AAPL is cheap. Solid earnings is truth regardless what happen in the world. AAPL bullet proof .
I'm floored this isn't up. This was a jaw droppingly good quarter.
The dementia is progressing.It won't take long.
"Options day tomorrow,there will be a load of covering done.a lot of buying in morning so price will rise but by end of day may be slightly negative.maybe close at 135-136.don’t worry climb next week to 140-150 by earnings call.GLTAGo apple "
"Apple is definitely not going to pursue its own search engine in a distant future, because Apple CEO Tim Cook is having some top priority projects under his wing now, such as Apple cars, Augment reality, podcast and streaming, healthcare and so on… So he doesn't like his work to be done in a rush and ended up a lemon which will tarnish ""APPLE"" brand reputation.Apple will continue it's to growth and thrive… Reputation is part of its biz moat."
"Looks like AAPL will drop after the ER, will sell some weekly puts tomorrow. Like both AAPL and MSFT earnings. Wait for their pullbacks to sell puts to acquire more shares."
Fb vs apple vs tsla! Who is going to win after hours?
Last night 20 million shares traded between the range of $145 down to $136. That is a good sign.STay LONG
expected was 1.01 it changed to 1.41 why?
I put a sell order for all my shares at $$$165.00
Been through two bear markets and they start when companies report great earnings but they sell off anyway. Hope this isn't the case.
Good buying opportunity!
WIN WIN BUYING BEFORE THE EARNINGS. AAPL CAN PULL A TESLA RALLY AND TRADE ABOVE 165 POST EARNINGS. UP 6-8 ON MONDAY
All in Apple!
Fidelity States that their Account Holders increased by 19% in 2020. So more people are investing for the future
They keep saying apple can't continue to grow but how can't they grow as it would be difficult to have a company become their competitor at this point. We have everything hooked up to apple.
I bought at $108.00. I will buy MORE. Apple is legit.
"Option expiration Friday, you know what that means, we might get the move next wek!"
144 premarket?
Again there’s nothing that’s going to be a positive market today no news Might see 135 today
Good day for AAPL
Always never fails fund managers manipulate this before earnings to make out like a bandit. It’s unbelievable
All price targets increased $160.00+ 
Keep buying
"N New reports indicate Apple could unveil a bumper earnings report at its call on January 27, possibly making it Apple's first-ever $100 billion quarter.First, from LLD:This three-monthly ritual might grab a few more headlines than normal because analysts expect Apple to generate sales of more than $100 billion a single quarter for the first time in its history. Russ Mould, AJ Bell Investment Director. ""If the consensus forecast of $102.6 billion is attained, that would equate to year-on-year sales growth of 12%, the fastest rate of advance in ten quarters.The report cites Apple's iPhone 12 launch and expected double-digit percentage increases in sales from services, wearables, and accessories"
AAPL WILL BE OVER 145 TOMORROW GUARANTEED. SMALL INVESTORS DO NOT WANT TO MISS THE POST EARNINGS RALLY AND INSTITUTIONS AND HF WILL BUY MORE AND SHORTS WILL COVER AND THERE ARE NO SELLERS. THX
AAPL's involvement in EV and autonomous vehicle will take this stock to $400 easily by end of this year!! This is in pipeline!!
"What a surprise, Moderna saying COVID requires them selling periodic booster vaccines forever...awfully convenient for MRNA"
Seeking advice. I hold shares with Apple long term. Looking to do a call option for when earnings come out and knowing this is the first since iPhone launch. Worth a try?
The swing in the price is usually you small retail players. The Big funds hold on fir a few years so it's you people on this board complainng of the price going down Because you are the ones selling apple not the investment banks
Futures green because of Apple 
"Gee, I’m starting to miss The President. The real President."
Now the long climb back up: price action reflected by selling is tough on Apple today. Stay long stay strong 
Hopefully tomorrow apple still up what do you guys think?
what a joke for Apple to drop this low! should have taken my profits when it hit $147!
"I need help from the gods above... I made a big mistake, and the life insurance is the only thing I can offer my family. I'm preying for help... God , be there in the morning for me, I know I made a mistake... Please help me with this"
MasterCard is up almost $11 and they reported $1.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Apple reported $111 billion in the stock is down. I don’t know about you but this doesn’t make any sense to me￼￼￼
Wouldn't it be nice if apple suddenly hit the roof like GameStop?
so 145 to 134 for a for a 7% correction post record earnings. load up folks.
"FB and AAPL will be down 10%.Bad day to be reporting, unavoidable."
I posted yesterday that I thought Apple would reach 170 through earnings Wednesday and I feel even more confident that it will reach that target. I’m buying call options for the Jan 29 170 strike. Only time I will play the options but that’s how good I feel about it. Agree?
Big (smart investors) looking into upcoming earnings. Getting in before Apple  jumps over $145
Tim Cook came out to say the growth will not be alot for services and wearables.. I think he just wanted to make Apple drop for the time being. Always for a stellar earnings Apple wants to buy back shares.. and always does at the cheap.. like after citron report release 
So this shows you just where we are in bizzaro world. LVS missed top and bottom...stock is up 3%. FB beats top and bottom... down 6%. So let’s hope AAPL misses. That seems to be the only thing that makes a stock move up in this upside down world.
"I have a very good Atheist Test and if you take this Test, you won’t be an Atheist for long ?Ask God a question that you don’t know the answer to.Ask Twice a day as if you would never stop !I usually get a response within a few weeks.When the answer comes a random thought will pop into your head that has nothing to do with your question and from that one thought, ideas will spawn that have nothing to do with your question.Then the answer will just pop into your head out of nowhere but you will believe that you just thought of it yourself, even though I just told you what would happen ?You choose the question!God knows everything !"
We have going to have double the earnings everyone expects! Massive growth! Robinhood forever!
"This is when you buy great companies...not when it's up 5%, but down 5%"
So where would this be if they missed on the numbers? 5 dollars?
Now! WE can make just as money leading into earnings as later.Stay Long.Let it RUN
This is just a market correction and hedges shorting. I'm holding till 170.
Facebook made too much money. We should sell and go buy GME that lost $600 million last quarter. Gotta love the stock market

It can only be a good for Aapl that the new administration is so proactive with fighting Covid and pushing for helping Americans in their time of need.
SEC should make new regulations: stocks must be held for at least 24 hour before resold. The markets would become more investment driven then speculative trading driven.
Apple shorts tomorrow at 4:30 sharp.
Day Um. MicroSoft up 12 point in after hours after they reported earnings. A foreshadowing of what will happen to Apple shares tomorrow!
Don’t let hedge funds steal from you! Buy Apple Hold Apple and Profit from Apple 
Here we go again. Same as last year before earnings release. GS had a sell rating on Apple. Apple went up to $400ish then split 4 for 1. I never listen to GS. They want you to sell so they can scoop up your cheap shares before earnings.
"Hold on, next week starting Monday Apple will start its ascent. In the mid 140s by Friday."
"Apple needs to do a reverse stock split 20:1.actually 1000:1This garbage of splitting stocks just causes huge swings.Warren buffet has it right 1 share = 320000 ish for Berkshire Hathaway.Best company in the world and we get 5% daily moves for zero reason!If. 1 share was 320000$ there would be no shorts.people would hold the shares for retirement no trading and shorting.this is a retirement stock and should be treated like it.Sad ,bad choices Cooky boy.smarten up.And give us a special dividend for that cash you got flowing.about 5 bucks a share.that will take care of your cash flow neutral mandate.I’m waiting for my checkBy the way board members I just got my proxy in the mail, you want my vote you know what to do,or I’ll vote for myself."
Market is completely mixed up....ahem GameStop and AMC. This will probably be the best ER from any company this quarter and yet look how we get nothing in return. Its truly sad what the market has turned into. Still long no matter what... this company is leading tech.
"it's about time we see some green, don't you thing?"
what just happened? Everything just went red.
I was surprised to see this down again today especially inlight of their supplier SWKS results last night. Market is impossible to predict as logic never seems to prevail but like they said earlier on CNBC the analysts all raised targets ahead of earnings instead of waiting for results which drove it up ahead of the release. This won’t stay down long however. 111 bil revenues? Unheard of!
$200 this year easy
I want this thing back to even by 8:00 pm EST.
According to a credible analysis Apple will 170$ because of high IPhone 12 sales.
Don’t forget end of the month is a weekend so monthly investments for the pension plans and 401 k and 403b and future tuition plans and IRA etc will come pouring in today and tomorrow and almost all of it goes into the stock market. Technology is the buzz word
"Many big pensions invested in Apple, they know what is ahead! Don’t let all the negativity getYou down all you new investors, just believe in the process!!! Apple will smash earnings in 10 days, GUARANTEED!!!"
"to all those that sold today, apple, twitter, google, Amazon. ya all have had little effect. lol. companies are no further down than any other down day."
Buy in under 100 per share
"Monday will be the start or the trek back to $145, it was imminent that we would have a sell off after earnings and the GME drama didn’t help. I see us returning to some normalcy next week, hope you bought the dip!!!"
tomorrow will be a fun day
"For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE STOP POSTING POLITICS ON AN AAPL FORUM. Nobody cares."
It will run higher. The market is just a little spooked right now.
Read the charts. I'll be lucky to get back @ 135. Let what is going on finish.
"coming back up ,"
HERE WE GO! CONGRATS!!!!!!!
decent bounce today. I hope the rest of the week is as good!
Get in today. $145 next week!! No way this goes down before earnings on Wed!!
"There is absolutely no reason in the world why Apple should be down if the posting world record profits this past quarter and the outlook is only Rosie, within a week this will all change when people realize this is the diamond it's always been and is going right back up!"
I love Apple. You love Apple. We all love Apple. You gotta love Apple. Just bought a new IPad Pro for the wife. Apple all the way.
Here is a fact for AAPL INVESTORS: In a span of only one year Apple more than doubled its market cap. 1/03/20. 1.172 Trillion. 1/25/21 2.4 Trillion. Need I say more?
Why it’s not up 10%
Looking for two things on Wednesday. Blow out earnings and positive guidance. We sail if those two things happen
Dow futures are up. Apple will open green. AH is just noise anyway.
Why is Apple down after strong earnings
Green by 8:30 this morning
Apple will provide guidance: Apple will give out free Mac computers to its investors with 1000 aapl shares or more.
"Tim, can you lose a few billion next quarter so we can get the stock price to go up?"
"Rich Apple investors!! BWEN is the cheapest WIND+SOLAR stock under $12 for high momentum gains! Market Cap $177M, low float 14M shares. Institutional ownership 57%. 317% increase annual gross profit. You can check it out, you guys are already rich, and your few shares can be transferred to ""BWEN""."
Dont look at the stock today 135$ calls are so strong ending tonight you cant do anything about it relax and see you on monday
I have a feeling the stock is coiled and will rip up tomorrow.
haircut has now reached 8% i guess shorties want it down 10% around 130 it will bounce hard after today shorties had their fun time to get out
The people saying “be patient & buy the dip” are very delusional.... liquidity problems and hedge funds are selling tech stocks to cover their losses trying to short meme stocks! They bought at March/2020 lows and already selling so they don’t go bankrupt! This can easily crash the market! Plus we now have manipulation problems where Brokeages are not letting you buy 30-40 limiting to 1 share per account and only to sell! We could see a huge gap down starting! Trade wisely!
LMAO. Desperate market makers trying to close their short positions on the cheap. This thing is just coiling again for the big run up. Hold tight to your shares folks !AAPL blew out all earnings expectations. $111 billion earnings with a cap B.
Record earnings in India means same for USA?
If you were selling this morning...you probably have no business owning this stock or any stock.
Appears to be several catalysts to drive this thing higher- yet totally underperforming- of late.. concerning..
"WEeks ago, ( my computer does this. It capitalizes ""WE"" when typing words?) WE posted $134 as posted twice as an intra day high. and $133+ as an intra day low.ALgorithim players need to close out before 1015 hrs.Anything can happen on Fridays. WE have seen AAPL run $4+ in the a.m. then close down $10.Congress phone call at 12000 about impeachment may be a factor"
$400 coming soon. All the glowing reports I read about the market this weekend specially the technology sector reinforces that
This week is a week of a bubble that may finally burst.Big boys are selling into a strength.I got out today seeing Microsoft price action.
Going to be an explosive earnings report.
Do we think we will see a dip or rise when Qtr earnings are released next week?
time to enjoy 
"Wow, a huge beat! $1.68 EPS, revenue of $111 billion, and net income of $28.7 billion. DURING A PANDEMIC, ladies and gentlemen! Every single reportable segment/ region was up with the Americas being the biggest as well as every single sales category with iPhone taking the lead. This should put an end to criticism that the company is not a growth play. Growth was everywhere compared to prior year's quarter (when there was not a pandemic yet). They also paid $30.5 billion in buybacks and dividends. I don't care that it's down after hours all I know is that Apple is a behemoth and that the future will be brighter than ever. I have even more reason to buy more shares now. This isn't a stock you trade. This is a stock you invest in and accumulate. Own it don't trade it."
126 to 142 .... already
200 a share tomorrow at open. I will buy house with cash 
The best thing $AAPL did to investors is asking $TSM to fabricate the 5G chips for them. That is very cost effect move and smart one too since $TSM is the world leader in manufacturing chips with state of art technologies.
There is literally no reason why AAPL should be falling
"Apple is a great company. Revenues and profits will go up every year. At the same time, PE is high at 35. Over time Apple will continue to go up but perhaps a little profit taking now to finance positions in other places."
This is good aapl is staying around $128-$130. Aapl is spring coiled ready after earnings. It will be buy the news on this.
Remember people never bet against Apple you will loose your shirt
I didn’t realize that tsla is reporting same day as Apple. Rising tide could send this flying.
OWN IT DON’T TRADE IT
People selling here. Smh
 Apple  $150 after earnings! Easy
Major cover by the shorts on the last trading day of the month and the market will rocket to the sky.
I just couldn't hold my hands and keep adding on dips ....This is golden chance guys...
"tO aLL INVESTORS, LET'S INFLICT PAIN ON THE SHORTS TOMORROW AND GET THEM TO COVER AAPL. SAME GAME AS pLAYED WITH GAMESTOP. THX"
earnings are gonna be a blowout. stock above 160 easily
Should I buy 1000 shares today...Undecided ??
"All the people that bought an ipad, iphone, etc last quarter...will not be buying again this year. Dirps."
What are you all panicking about? the ER isn't even out yet.
Just thrown down $15grand on Apple ! This company has a massive future !
Apple is a major player with immaculate financials. It was also one of warren buffets main earners for 2020 despite him shorting a portion of his stock. Long term buy even still even now.
Why we have $142 yet? Should be $150
3 days with my iPhone 12 Pro. WOW is this thing fast clear and non stop. Great at everything it does. I have found no apps videos spread sheets database apps. Video edits nothing slows this down. No LAG..Great Job Apple. I will buy more Apple stock today..
Remember no one can fight a central bank printing of money  shorts will bankrupt
"This is just part of why we aren't seeing this stock boom right now. While the pandemic was good for Tim's pocketbook it is not indicative of Apples current worth or future performance. However, historically, it's one of the best places to put your money in order to make money."
"Long story in long, strong earnings, strong company, great future, if markets tanks they have capability to come up fast. if you love your money go long with $AAPL, $MSFT, $FB"
News flash for new investors: Stocks occasionally go down too. Even the best ones.
All iPhone 12 sales booked after October due to covid. Apple one subscriptions and apple plus tv no longer free. M1 chip Mac sales. Wearables through the roof. More stim checks on the way. Apple will have biggest quarter in history Book it
"This will be down 15 dollars today and will continue through next week, stick will trade at 75 a share"
We need a short squeeze.
I waited 4 months for this??
Has anyone looked ahead to 2nd and 3rd quarter earnings? I bet they do just as well as the 1st.
Apple stock is not trading.. Its for investing.. If you want to trade and short there are many better alternatives. This stock is for the long term investor.. Its climb is slow but steady and sure . Peace.
All the more reason for the Reddit crowd to jump on Apple for the blatant manipulation by the hedge fund managers of this stock price. The co blows out earnings and they tank it to shake out weak hands since they probably shorted it at 145. Time to teach them a lesson with the most widely owned stock on the planet
Oh well I broke the number one rule: don’t put all your eggs in one basket! I’ve made really good money from other stocks through the pandemic and poured everything into Apple . I’ve been buying and holding waiting for this year to come. I’m not scared.
"Stock market is becoming a joke. Company A reports actual earnings, stock goes down. Company B losing millions, stock surges like crazy. What a mess with all the manipulation out there."
I am the one who predicted Apple’s 110b revenue 3 days ago.. now with India in apple’s radar. The next earnings I predict will grow in every product sector again. With India sale growth also. 
"NO POLITICS HERE KIDS ...STICK TO APPLE, we can all benefit if we keep it clean and only about APPLE news and direct APPLE money ."
"i have hard time understanding of why AAPL. stock price is crashing , while at the same time too many financial expert are upgrading the price target to 150 to 170"
Unless we have a pandemic next year there is no way they can make their earnings and why there is no guidance....sales were pressed FORWARD so now it gets a lot tougher....much tougher. Boolean
The current SP will look like a bargin this time next year ....
We should all just buy Tesla and only Tesla. It is the only stock worth having from now until the end of time.
Buy buy buy!!!!!!!
"why do you guys think that AAPL should keep going up?!? one of the most widely held positions and those earnings were already baked into the price. just have to look at the upgrades which took place BEFORE earnings vs after them. i've been a widely successful trader for over 25 years, made a small fortune, and AAPL is one way i have amassed that fortune. but they are overbought here, should be trading closer to $120, and are funny enough taking FB down with them as the spat between Cook and Zuckerberg continues."
"Last earnings (10/29) AAPL did the same thing but dropped 5.6%. Over the next 2 weeks, AAPL was up 10.5% and began setting new highs... Similar set up should yield the similar results... AAPL is simply trading in an Up-Channel, but the trend is still UP!! Buy every dip..."
Apple won’t go any more lower IMO.. apple did go up today and fell.. Let’s hope for a better tomorrow.
Dang expected to wake up seeing $145. It’s all good we’re going to eat today
Fakest ovrnite futures manipulation i ever saw $aapl $amzn $pltr u know what to do
"Calm down everyone! Take a look at the one year chart, the current lows are bouncing off the upwards trend line starting from March 2020. Earnings are on the 26th and all reports are showing apple earnings are going to be great! Sounds like some of you FOMOd in at the $135ish price when the apple car rumors came out last month."
February could be a brutal month...I'll buy a few shares if it hits 110.
Once it hits 400-500 another split 5-1
Just confirmed post by Common sense. One hour ago Hyundai and Apple announced a joint venture in production of electric cars. It’s real it’s coming.
The big flush starts in 25 minutes.AAPL below 130 and the Dow down 1000+.Buy late next week in the mid 120's. You can't fight this.
$AAPL closes week at 136-138
I see there are probably shorts here that got burned last week just sore they lost money! Haaaaa
"Too many calls that need to expire worthless this week, so price will be wash traded flat. But option action negligible next week, so AAPL allowed to climb Monday"
Market has run up far too muchThe profits are already baked inDon't let the talking heads convince you to hold while their hedgie friends unload their position at your exspense
I expect 160 $ on the 27th after earnings 
"If you make a bad comment about our president and his economic policy’s , Yahoo deletes it."
"I own Apple, Visa and NIO,, thank God Visa and NIO Bailed me out today,Still Baffled how Apple can be going down after setting a stock market record on 111 Billion Quarter ! I'm remaining Long on All the Stocks I own, time will be our friend! Good luck All."
"Short squeeze this week boys!! $135 by next week. Patience pays off, now it's our turn. So many people have shorted shares like @SonnyBlack. Once this thing starts to go up this week, it will go even higher once they have to start selling off. New all time highs!!"
"ALERT,ALERT,ALERTZERO INTEREST, MORE VACCINES, OPENING UP IN CALIFORNIA, BIGGEST BEAT EARNINGS IN HISTORY. AAPL UP 8"
The revenue was 10% higher than expected. It’s the Macro environment that got people shell shocked. This will move shortly enough over the next few quarters
AAPL earnings in 2 weeks ... Jan. 27. Buy on dips. BUY ON DIPS and hold going into earnings.
Munster says Apple on its way to 3t market cap and will reach 200 a share eoy
I am going on record here. NO WAY NO HOW IS APPLE DOWN TOMORROW. Tomorrow AAPL will not disappoint. 
So we have gone up $2 a share since early September. Way to go Timmy. Utter fail.
"Seems like we should see $145-150 through Wednesday, then ""maybe a 10%-12% jump after earnings."" Conservative estimate (I hope!!) for Thursday morning is $160. "
"Where is the 185 upgrade ?Oh , it’s coming !!!"
"Sell, not all but some for a profit. They are going to beat, but someone will find 1 negative and the stock will tank."
this head fake happens so many times afterhours closes $145-$147 by eod tomorrow maybe $150 Friday
Apple products rarely go on sale but people buying them like crazy. Apple stock is currently at least on 10% discount but people selling it....
"Sell off coming, future guidance will be a big disappointment. Still looking at a 12%-18% correction before summer."
"I'd like to see the look on Rod Hall's face when Apple reported record earnings. I'm sure his clients are forming a lynch-mob right now. He deserves nothing more for giving investors poor advice by telling them to Sell Apple. Anyone who followed his advice to dump Apple will have lost quite a bit of money over the lastfew weeks. It's a shame he gets to keep his job with such lousy analysis of Apple. Oh, well. That's how Goldman Sachs operates. A bunch of crooks."
2.3 trillion....That is what the company is trading for currently. Some people should look at how the numbers make sense at price share levels of 150 or 200. 99% of publically traded companies that make good money are not even worth 1 trillion. Berkshire Hathaway isn't worth even 600 billion. WalMart is only worth 415 billion.
"The M1 laptops still have a delivery time of 1-3 weeks (and have since the launch), what a great sign of exceptional volumes! The silicon Macs will be huge for Apple in the coming years (with M1X coming soon..)."
"The decline came despite glowing reviews for the quarter from Wall Street. Barron’s counted at least 16 analysts raising their targets for Apple’s stock price, and we may well have missed a few. The company had double-digit growth in every product category, with record revenues in every geographical market. It reported a huge rebound in sales in China, and achieved gross margins that were more than a full percentage point higher than expected. The company continues to repurchase vast amounts of shares: Facebook (ticker: FB) announced a $25 billion buyback program on Wednesday, but Apple bought back that much stock in the December quarter alone. ------- Then it must be Hedge Funds & brokers?"
Face it . Appl is the future . Twitter and Facebook are nothing compared to Apple . We will only rise
AMD up big after huge revenue and earnings beat - This plus Msoft earnings bodes well for Apple tomorrow!!
"Am I taking profits after earnings? No I am not. My shares are not for sale, thank you for your interest. Apple longs know to own it don't trade it. This is such a simple but poorly understood statement. Holding long is how you keep your cost basis down and this is how huge gains are made. In the case of Apple, holding long has been a blessing. And besides if you sell out you might miss the Project Titan reveal whenever that happens. So in short, own it don't trade it."
"Stocks going to be $160 . Amazing earnings , Gov printing money !"
"Losing all of the gains today, wow ! why the drop"
News just trending now “consumer confidence higher “.
"Today's activity was traders and weak hands selling in anticipation of Tuesday's election results. I'm not here to choose sides. Who cares if the capital gains rate will increase? Not me I'm holding long term. That's where longs have an advantage. I'm buying the dips this week. Go long and don't pay attention to the noise. Set your goals, have an open mindset, and you can sleep easy at night."
"After-Hours Volume 19,711,375After-Hours High $145.00After-Hours Low $136.55"
As a long term Apple shareholder I am disappointed that they have joined the move to ban free speech. If they are not going to make Parlor available then I will be selling my shares.
like my Apples GREEN pre mrkt!!! 'f ACRX rocketing higher pre mrkt on Volume!! look @ ACRX up 40% in 2 days!!!
Bought in at $138 - hope It was a good move
"Gene Muster on CNBC analyzing AAPL earnings, check it out!"
Too expensive and no I'm not shorting.
"When taking into account my entire family and all of our clients, we have made over $10 million dollars off AAPL alone. That's why I have zero tolerance for shorts on this name...when you make money like that it's game over. Shorts will never see money like that, not even close. The best they can hope for is pocket change, at worst homelessness. If AAPL were the only stock you ever owned and you owned enough at a cheap enough price, you could hang up your business suit and retire to Florida. Vs. being short you could be forced to fly a sign at a highway exit. You have to decide which sounds better: retirement or begging for money. The answer to anyone with a brain is obvious."
"Strength in Apple iPhone sales bodes well for Qorvo, Skyworks, says Oppenheimer Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer believes that the strength in Apple's ($AAPL) iPhone sales bodes well for RF suppliers Qorvo ($QRVO), Skyworks ($SWKS), and Broadcom ($AVGO) as well as core audio supplier Cirrus Logic ($CRUS). The analyst also points out Apple is shipping the in-house designed M1 ARM processor into entry Mac NB, and might be working on a higher performance ARM processor for high-end NB.(thefly)"
gradually accumulating it!!!
Apple will be $200 middle of summer. Last chance
"Hyundai and Apple are teaming up to launch a test version of the ""Apple Car"" next year, with a production capacity of 100,000 units in 2024."
Moral of the story next earnings report sell the day before then come back
Plummeting after hours - oh noooo
who wants to play... at what time AAPL goes positive? I'll start... 1pm.
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD! ONLY ALLOWED TO BUY ONE SHARE OF GME AND AMC. F. Ing joke. I truly hope Robin Hood goes out of business. Please empty your RH accounts everyone.$AMC $NIO $LAZR $SBE $IPV $AAPL $EGLX $CCIV
Its down about 80 cents (big surprise) today -9:30 ct but My belief is its going to beat expectations ( think it has last 3 or 4) . I believe its a good Bet(gamble) and just cashed in my checking act. (80%) to buy another 60 shares. There is No common sense in today market but these Hip stocks(Tesla too) keep on climbing beyond real value.. Buy half (might as well sit out-lol) or go with the steamroller of a stock. my advice(which is worthless) -Hang 10.. Ride the Wave.. Good Luck to All of Us. I will enjoy reading the replys( like this spelling better). Much success to All in 2021 > especially in early 2021.
"All they do is trying to make people sell AAPL so they can buy lower. When apple beat earnings, I am buying the fk out of it. I am selling apple when they stop m￼aking electronics (few shares possibly). Earnings just confirmed that apple is undervalued."
145_+ today ??
"We longs have all enjoyed the train ride, a new adventure is unfolding, stay long and enjoy the ride."
I got 6 shares at 135 last week lol
Up almost $3 wait till another hr. Nasq up 121 you’re looking at China at Debo’s today tech will be up almost 200 Apple will be up over $4 145 today Wendsday 150 easily Earnings best Apple ever had 22/27 you’re looking at Thursday 175-180
"Amazing Amazing earnings. 100Bill quarter. What other company can make that claim? The markets are very volatile right now, otherwise Apple would be up to 150 after hours. Keep your eye on the ball. This is the most profitable company in U.S. history with a massive pile of cash and is on the cusp of entering into AI and EV. Buy the dips and ignore the short term noise. This should meet or beat all the bullish price targets by the end of the year."
The perfect stock if it paid reasonable dividends. Maybe someday be nice if it was at least a .50 a share per quarter
You cant expect apple to go to 150 tonight look the market is down Probably go up tomorrow but forget the 170
Apple will buy QS and also buying $GM...yah $aapl!
Finally a big scary selloff!!! We needed this $aapl $fb $jpm $googl to reset and refresh oh $tsla is gonna go to 300
They just beat by 8 billion in revenue! That's more revenue the GME made all of last year LOL.
Tony Balooga has now raised Apple’s price target 4 times in the last 2 days. This is unprecedented.
To those interested: Dow futures opening in 5 minutes.
$144+ soon.why?It printed twice the past two days...trends of three
"Earnings days are rarely good days....regardless of the numbers. Can’t explain it other than tech stocks do not have risk/reward equality. The risk is high, the reward is low. I’m not sure it’s worth holding any tech thru earnings."
I'm a little confused. Apple expect to have record quarter. Why are people scared and selling. Do you think apple will stop selling services phone and computer? And when the finally announce an icar then that's a whole nother market to dominate. Scared money don't make money. 100 billion in a quarter and people are running scared? Go figure. If you are so easily manipulated then I can only imagine your political views . 
I know lot of you are laughing at me when I say Apple goes to $400 by December 2021. The quarterly results will be shockingly great
I live in a smaller town and I know at least 8 people personally who spent their stimulus checks on new I-Phones...and that is just me in a small town in one corner of the country....imagine how many others did it too...I think the next two Q's are going to be blowout for AAPL and price will hit $250
thank you apple finally you give me 100%
Tesla gets upgraded by Morgan Stanley in after hours. up another 15 points. remember this is equivalent to 75 points pre split. we get 2 upgrades today and we move a tiny amount. Tesla is like a broken slot machine that pays off each day. this is making many amateurs very wealthy. too easy to be happening.
Goldman Sachs ----sticking to your $75 Apple price target?
"Once algorithim players are set AAPL should run, maybe $144 by Friday"
I am hoping this stays around even going into earnings because they will crush expectations. I am looking for at least 5%-6% gain when earnings are announced!!
The reddit trade stocks are crashing
Algorithm players expected $130+ after $126+ intra day low at open.
Rally looking good...but now jealous media will fight back about how many ‘trillions’ Apple is worth...wait for it...
"For one thing, Apple made it political by banning Parlor"
I think today's stock action after historic earnings is a sign of things to come. I don't think this is due to Gamestop and other shorted stocks. AAPL is the most widely held stock and this trading action is very concerning.
Post your positions.Me I have 2000 shares at average cost of 129 a share holding for 10 years.Remember stay strong and classy.
what happens to Netflix now will happen to apple in 8 dayswait and see150 is coming
"Over 4.5M shares traded and still green, great indicator!"
Note to all the pessimistic doubters: Long term AAPL has been a winner year after year. A bump here and there is totally expected as long as the stock recovers quickly and AAPL has done so. So far for me AAPL has been profitable and I am confident it will continue to do so. For my wife and I AAPL has been a positive venture and we both are long with confidence. 
Looks like we will be in the 145-147 range for ER tonight. And I fully expect ER will be blowout with some added extras and tomorrow AAPL opens 160+.
200M more shares bought back and retired. Apple can buy back half its market value in 8-9 years
Don’t let the institutive thieves scare you and steal your shares !!! Look at the business and it’s future prospects
Holding strong on a -300 Dow.
"buy all the Apple shares you can for the next couple years, before they release the new Apple car...."
pretty crazy how message boards and the retail investor have overtaken Wall street and the corruption! i’m loving this. only a matter of time when the retail investors will pump Apple to $1000 a share
"My forecast for the next 4 trading days:Thursday: not much move either wayFriday: The DOW down 1,000Next Monday: slight bounceTuesday or Wednesday: The DOW down 2000"
All time high coming tomorrow
"Aapl will report record Q1 numbers for iPhone, it’s bread and butter!"
"Those that sold upon Apple removing Parlor, nice job!"
Every one of my posts although polite but critical of the current President is getting removed by Yahoo censor within few minutes.Welcome to the United Soviet States of America!
Apple deserves a lofty valuation because1. Rates are very low 2. If Apple can build their own microchips ... don’t you think they also leverage low cost debt and do spectacularly3. Phone shipping boxes are smaller ie lower shipping costs4. Loyal customer base 5. Excellent & unbelievable customer service!6. Apple one! combining services is huge!7. The recent upgrade is so hotly in demand that Apple had to ramp up production!8. Continually positively surprises me on the daily! 9. Wonderful “systems” 10. Apple will surely find new things to try! Apple car? Apple VR? Apple Airplane? Theres really no limits and they do it right ie quality and price every time11. The iPhone mini... people are underestimating how popular a powerful & low cost phone is throughout the world!Keep it up Apple! Great Job 
munster said they blowout earnings and has a 200 pt. probably by the end of the year.
Wall street Hedge fund and CNBC are all shorts
Today's action?All boats rise and fall with the tide.Stay long going into earnings.Enough has been posted about options
We rally tomorrow the numbers are just too good.....just watch
"Apple's iPhone 12 supercycle reality 'meeting the initial hype,' says Wedbush Outperform rating and $160 price target on Apple shares with a ""bull case"" target of $200.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the firm's Asia supply chain checks on iPhone 12 5G demand point to a trajectory that now exceeds his ""bull case scenario"" for units in FY21, contending that it appears the iPhone 12 supercycle ""reality is meeting the initial hype"" so far. Based on recent Asia checks, he believes the supply chain is anticipating iPhone unit builds in the low to mid 90M range for the December quarter and for the March quarter he thinks builds for total iPhones ticked up another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60M-70M range, Ives tells investors. While the Street is forecasting roughly 217M iPhone units for FY21, based on the current trajectory and in a bull case, Apple has the potential to sell more than 240M units and ""250M could be in the cards,"" added Ives,"
Kept trying to tell option traders to not hold for earnings. This is why. But you guys think im trying to short the stock. Long term apple will go to the moooon.
This stock is undervalued. If you’re worried just look at 5 yr chart. Set and forget
This is great for my 401 K but terrible my Apple holdings . This much buying today and the best earnings in the history of earnings and nothing but sellers ??
Serious beatdown on a strong earnings.
"144 will come fast once the bell rings...looking for 145-148 at ER, 160+ on announcement"
Apples best earnings yet the stock goes down. That's ok cuz I know it will go up cuz people just can't let a cash cow go too long before they get back in.
"I have been saying for years “do not short the market “. Now see what happened? People had to cover their short positions big time specially the hedge funds and in that process had to sell their long term precious holdings hence and therefore the market went down . Now according to Fox , SEC is getting involved. In summary for God’s sake stay invested and stay long. Have a core holding (I will name a few) such as Apple, Microsoft, google, Nvidia, Netflix, Qualcomm, Amazon, Facebook , Walmart, semiconductors sector, Oracle, Costco, Target etc etc etc and then buy mutual funds such as from Fidelity etc etc . Buy Blue Chip Growth, Select semiconductor, Small Capital Growth, OTC, Select Technology etc etc and then relax and let the experts at the mutual funds make decisions for you. Yes you buy the mutual fund at the beginning of your investments (sector) but then the experts do the research as to which companies to buy in that specific sector"
Betting against Apple has been a fools game for decades. It was a record setting blowout quarter. If memory serves me correctly last quarter they also didn’t give guidance and presto! .......A massive quarter. They didn’t give guidance today so if they are going to get punished then so much the better for me. I’ll add some more mañana on the back of that fantastic quarter. I thank you kindly. Long and Strong in the FLA 
"no one expected a $8 billion beat in revenue, it should be green shortly"
Futures are green!!! Good!!!
"If you woulda taken a fraction of your Apple money and placed it on GameStop, you woulda made a million in a couple months...."
Great day guys and girls! Get yourself a whisky and have a great weekend!
TSLA should be $142.00. Apple should be $800.00.
I guess not today....
Short term pain action But stay long!
Don’t be surprised if it drops right before earnings.... stay in y’all!!
"Oh my God Texas Instruments beat , AT&T beat , Microsoft beat, Nasdaq beat. All with a wide margin both top and bottom line. Rocket fueled and ready to take off to the sky"
if i do the math- apple gross profit a day... $600million A DAY!
After hours trading don’t mean anything.
"Help me understand this, FB loses 1 million customers and misses revenue projections and they are up $13; Apple blows out their numbers 111 billion and yet Apple is down $3"
News flash: AAPL won’t be sliding for three months based on that ER
Just found the article on Appl threatening free speech Parler. As a result as a long term shareholder i just sold my entire position after hrs and will never own again. C
"Owned for a decade, never sold a single share. I have kept adding, great cornerstone stock."
best stock ever. power of trillion dollar maket cap
long run have patience 
"Big money is conspiring to get the market entirely disinterested in AAPL so they maximize their gain from blowout ER, after which AAPL gets bound to a whole new trading range.Be patient & keep buying!"
.205 dividend in February ! How much will apple buyback stock in 2021?
Be patients appl will go back up.
"The smart folks that made a killing with GME & AMC this week will rotate substantial monies into gold standard for investors, APPLE STOCK. There is allot of money there ! Apple is shooting much higher as soon as ignorant and weak finish bailing (if they haven't already). Apple Long & Strong as always !"
"Wow, I remember thinking of selling multiple times, especially from 12-16 when Apple was really dead money, and just last March during the Covid drop. Fortunately I didn't either time and it's been a life changer. Scary thing is the future seems bright for Apple with the new projects they are rumored to be involved with. Good luck to all."
"F my call options, i dont even care anymore. I genuinely want to see how low this stock goes after an earnings beat like this. It is entertaining at this point. We have not had a correction like this since october and of course it happens the day or Apple earnings. Sometimes you cannot even get mad, just embrace the frustration"
"The Dow went from 20K to 30K during the last 4 years. At that growth rate, in 4 years (Jan. 2025) we should see Dow 45K or better. And AAPL at $560 or better. Right?"
"this is the canary in the coal mine….along with GameStop….Blackberry ….Tesla….excess is everywhere.

The best tool in investing is recognizing what traps your own mind may fall into."

WHAT DOES POLITICS HAVE 2 DO WITH APPLE STOCK???
It’s been playing the same game for months. I personally is very tired of the pattern. Can’t wait to get out. I don’t want to gain a fine. Just let me break away even at this w. Got in almost 5 months ago at 133. Can’t wasting my time and watch other stocks goes up. AAPL l surrender. Can’t stomach it anymore.
Today is going to be a good day!
"$AAPL wants to buyout Canoo and the CANOO said, NOPE! only subscription :)Talks still goes on"
Do you think if i will buy more shares now i will get more money tommorow after earning ?
Dow futures down big ...Nas futures up big. All $$ flowing to tech today.
Glad I didn’t bet on that. Before it’s earning. . Now it’s sell on news. Would have lost $10 g.
don't put your full trust in Yahoo after hours glitches happen not just with Apple hold long stay strong great earnings coming
No reason whatsoever why this is red
See you should be buying companies that lose tons of money. They go up like 150 points a day.. like that makes sense.
Head fake again! Watch Apple  turn green today.
150 next week
"I love Apple stock, but the fact that it's my only green this morning with my other solid dividend players red,tells me there truly is a HUGE tech bubble.DIVERSIFY !!"

So apples App Store had a 35% increase in Christmas Day. Wonder if that corresponds to a comparable increase in devices.
$175 on Wednesday
"Will the $142 range be the next launching pad? ""Ives raised his price target on Apple's stock to $175 from $160, but also laid out a bull case for why the stock could climb to as high as $225."" 5...4...3...2...1....LIFT OFF!"
Look at last six months chart.AAPL behaves like thisSep 01: $134.18Sep 23: $107.12DEc 29: $134.89Jan 05: $126.35Jan 25: $145.17
"Back under 120 is a certainty now, even with record numbers.People are clearing the decks. Too risky."
"Apple will do pretty well on earnings but it appears Netflix is going to put Apple to shame in share price gains despite all the streaming content competition. That's pretty impressive. I don't know why Apple can't load up on video content for their AppleTV+ service. Apple has over a billion active devices on iPhones, iPads, desktops and laptops to serve content to. I keep hearing people say Apple's streaming content is rather thin. Apple can't just grow subscribers with original content because that's too expensive. Apple needs some classic content to fatten up its library. I still watch X-Files, Magnum P.I., The Rockford Files, etc. Good shows are always watchable even if they're decades old. How can Apple compete with Netflix for new subscribers if there isn't much content to watch. So Netflix shareholders will likely see 15% to 20% gains in share price on earnings. That's where the big money is going and it's perfectly understandable Apple may be ignored. Netflix is much easier to move than Apple is.I think Apple needs to double-down on streaming content to pull more subscribers. That seems like a no-brainer to me. Will Apple get even 8% share price gains on earnings? I sure hope so."
"Funny true story my uncle 83 yrs old calls me last week. He knows I day trade stock and tells me my aunt 82 yrs had her dad gave her some apple stock back in the that he bought for like 20 or 30 cents. He said thought it was like 100 or 200 shares. He asked me if I thought it was worth much. I said uncle get off the phone and call your financial advisor you might be in for surprise. Calls me yesterday said the FA said they 7,430 shares of apple at over 1 million. Tells me well that seemed to be a good investment. I almost died. Crazy"
I accidentally muted someone. Looked everywhere....how do I unmute? Any help appreciated!
By noon tomorrow Apple will have 5 or 6 new Analyst Upgrades. $200 price targets
Yikes; sinking like a stone. Was Bernie Madoff named CEO on Monday or something?
"As I know during the pandemic, the Apple store was the only store has lot of customers lining up to get in every time when I walk passed. It is about the brand, the supporters. Unless there is another brand surpass the Apple and some really bad news that hurt the Apple image. Otherwise, Apple stock is very safe to keep. I don't ever listened to the what they called themselves :"" Annalists "". The most important is the Apple has a very solid finance foundation."
I ain’t selling! This thing did $111 billion in one quarter! Nothing short of a Mona Lisa when it comes to the execution of a masterpiece brilliance of Apple. Deserves a much higher multiple!
Today’s volume is running 25% above the 50-day average for this point in the trading session. Stock movements on high-volume days are an indicator of future movement — far better than trying to discern a trend from low-volume days.
"Unbelievable results, mind boggling!"
I love apple.
"Watch how tomorrow around 10:00 AM pacific time the market makers will Apple rally a nit in order to get more option buyers to come in and then close it flat! remember this post. Sky works had earnings today and up over $20 after hours because of 5G, Apple goes down $5!"
Tesla up again. only 35 points. 100 % invested in Tesla. this is too easy. momentum chasing momentum. this is a dream come true. it is like a broken slot machine paying off each day.
Not only it was a blowout... But Apple is still in the ‘early innings’ amid strong 5G iPhone sales. 1Q 2021 is going to be yet another blow out! That is with discounting any announcing regarding iCar.
Lets close at 140 today and 145 by Wednesday and 150 by Friday
tomorrow after hours will be the real explosionremember me it will go above 170
Going lower. If it drops after knocking it our of the park whats to keep it from dropping more

Don't look now but here she comes.
Of trend from now until earnings! Earnings are going to be huge!! If you sold within the last couple of days I feel bad for you! 140 by the end of this week!
"Record $100 bill+ qtr and it drops 3% lmao wierd. I think its got more to do with Fed Chairman's comments yesterday and ppl just being cautious with Apple valuation and investing elsewhere, though the valuation seems more than justified!!"
"1st time appl owner, going to park some $ here for awhile. quarter was just tungsten steel strong"
ATH today? We ain’t even had a power lunch yet!
India‘a extraordinarily strong results point to a total blow out quarter . I would not be surprised to see this at $160+ before Friday close .

"$145.05 After hours is all time high. Or 4 cents below it, close enough."
aapl holders. has the market ever been this volatile in aapl. this is the 1st time a saw 2 big corrections like this.
111.4 Billion quarter and the Wall street crooks sell it off anyway. You could not possibly come up with a better quarter than this. In the mean time the crooks of WallStreet took GME to 300 today.
"Funny how people are obsessed with iphone, but don't even realize that this is the year that apple takes over the high end windows desktop."
"The market often behaves like an emotional child. Adults in the room see AAPL's future and will respond accordingly. I know a few people who, on the advice of their adviser, sold Apple more than a year ago. On top of a 3/4% annual fee they got terrible advice. Stay long and be happy!"

"apple is a huge buy , but hedges seeking to get in at a lower price , buy now or stay poor"
All those that sold at 138-139 after hours ...What were you thinking? The report isn't even out yet...
If Apple is actually building an EV they should in my opinion install electric generating solar windows and panels to extend the mileage and lower the cost of operation. I read that the Chinese EV companies are moving in that direction. The company that came to my attention recently that appears to have the most advanced technology is Clearvue Technologies CVUEF. I hope Apple doesn’t let those Chinese competitors get the jump on them.

morgan stanly target is $190 for APPLE. Need to buy some calls before the earnings because it will move massive after the earnings it seems.
"Apple App Store revenue grew 31% in December, a third straight month with 30%+ growth. This brings the growth rate to 31% for the Dec-qtr, a notable improvement from the 25% growth in the Sept-qtr (worth noting street models call for services growth of 19% in Dec-qtr vs. 16% reported in Sept-qtr). We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to ~$4.8bn in December; up 31% Y/Y (vs. +32% in November, +30% in October). Revenue grew 28% in 2020, an acceleration from the 21% growth rate in 2019…Net/Net: Continued growth in the 30% range could support upside to our 18% services growth estimate in the Dec-qtr, especially as Apple Care headwinds should moderate given the iPhone launch."

A special dividend would be awesome like Costco did.
Why is this down with the quarter they just had
Hedge fund has to sell apple to cover their short in GameStop and other crazy stocks. This may explain the price drop today.
"Up $4.20 Today ! Excellent sign for the near & Long Term. Patience will Payoff in the Long Run, as always"
when they announce the earnings report? After market today?
"Patience is key. Big money is beating down on retail longs, hoping we’ll eventually give up and sell...not a single share"
the market is down today because they want it to be....the big institutions grabbed some more shares as the vix was high......they win again as we residential holders have no choice to do anything else but hold
It won’t end up green because GameStop is still ruining the whole market. This is HARD market manipulation
come on. In at 136. Hope I don’t lose.
"This is ALL options related, pure and simple!"
I'm so glad that my Apple & Amazon shares finally decided to wake up from their 5 month long hibernation. These 2 stock have gone nowhere since August and my Tesla shares had had to shoulder the burden for my portfolio. Now Apple & Amazon can take over and give my Tesla shares a break.
Would you say this a time to buy AAPL stocks while it’s in the 140 range ? Or will there be a decrease in prices soon ? ....
of course I bought calls 145 expiring Friday.. My name speaks for itself..
For sure AAPL will hit $175.00 before summer !
Monday AAPL opens above 140 then heads to 150's

Oh my God IBM made $2.07 vs an estimate of $1.79 this quarter. That’s a home run right out of the ball park. Very very positive affect on the market specially the technology sector today

If I had any money left I would buy more Apple! It should be some where in the neighborhood of $150 next week!
just hedge funds selling to cover short positions
AAPL is in the portion of my portfolio that I don't worry about. Fundamentals are solid and history is on my side. Rest easy friend. Two months from now you will forget this day ever happened.
To be able to wait long time and have patience for what ever is coming down in the short term is GOLD. Next stop $160!!
Good quarter...That's it..You just stay with it...

Does anyone here ever plan to sell their shares of Apple? Or do they just plan on accumulating it until they die and leave it for somebody else to purchase the toys of their dreams?I'm just asking because everyone says they will never sell their Apple shares and hold them forever. No one ever talks about a long-term plan to accumulate and purchase something that they've always desired.

"The Tim Cook army is coming for Tesla. Tesla has only a limited time to try to fit into that oversized bubble of a market cap it current has. Because when Apple comes out, it's going to come out swinging. Look what happened when the iPhone first came out - BlackBerry pretty much lost massive business. The entire smartphone industry shifted. Thats what could happen. And it will not take decades for Apple to make a destructive entrance. By partnering with existing manufacturers it is relieved of having to construct massive foundries which cost billions. Partner to reduce costs and improve margins. The Apple way. The smart way."
Time to get in to AAPL
Nice day aapl
The lack of guidance was the trigger. I’m long and don’t care about today. Ready to buy more
"Don’t forget the month end is near which means a massive infusion of cash into the stock market via 401k and 403b plan , IRA, pension funds etc etc. That should drive the market higher .

And finally my uncle Warren is always looking for opportunities to invest. Every time he is eating ice cream at the local Dairy Queen he is contemplating his next investment and his next move.

Bought back in after a while. Let's gooooo......
145 after hrs as I predicted Friday If we hit 150 tomorrow as I said You’re looking at 175-180 earnings maybe 185-190 Friday
To everyone asking how this could go down after great earnings. That's not entirely true. Apple went up big time in the week heading into earnings. The institutions new apple would have a blowout quarter and they bought big time heading into earnings. That's how it always happens. If everyone started buying once the earnings were out and there was confirmation then investing and trading would be a joke...and easy. Simple as that. Stocks go up into earnings when the outcome is still unclear and the risk/reward is much higher.
"Since Robinhood can not buy $gme and only can sell, come and do tesla's GME!!!!!!Let's make tesla into a $10,000 stock now!!!!!!!!!$gme, $amc, $BB, $aapl, $bac, $nio!!!"

How is it possible that this didn't go through the roof after hours?? It actually went DOWN! Amazing

"Only 111 billion, no big deal. I can make that much in one dream."
"To the people who argues that Nokia does not has enough short ratio to spark a rally like GME, I hope we can reason it out with some simple math:The market cap for GME is <1B. With a 80% short, the hedges get to make ~800M in the event that the stocks get utterly eviscerated. If share prices double, the hedges will lose 800M. This is what it means in dollar terms.Nokia might only have 10% shorts, but with a market cap of 23B, the hedges basically has a 2.4B bet - 3 times that of what they have on GME. TLDR: If the masses have our way, NOK will be more painful for the hedges than GME.Mpreover, there are mounting evidences that the funds are paying to attention to Nokia.(1) Recall the halt that happened 2 nights ago right after prices shot up to 9.79? Prices crashed immediately thereafter. It was obvious that certain circuit breaker measures were triggered by some large players. Measures to scare us off that is.(2) 1B volume traded in a single day and prices stay flat. It is obvious some big players were able to stagnate the prices with ladder trading. Likewise, scare tactics.(3) After hours crashes - only hedge funds can do after hours trade, so why the crash? It is obvious they don't want the price to rise and they are scaring us off with low volume dips.(4) Why was NOK singled out alone with other reddit stocks for a ban if the hedges were not concerned?Hold your lines guys. We are on the verge of victory."
You can buy AMC and I buy AAPL here lol
A 5$ worth GME touched 240$ ...AAPL supposed be 200$ by tomorrow

Tomorrow will see green. Investors Can’t pass up the $111.4 rev! Up we go!
Consider the news on earnings is already built into the current price. An upside will depend on its future guidance.
Be very selective at this time; in the market. Buy AAPL. That's it for now.

"Warning —SHORTS COVER NOW ! You are ABOUT TO BE VERY UNHAPPY.Apple and Hyundai in talks over electric vehicle partnershipJan. 07, 2021 10:01 PM ETApple Inc. (AAPL)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor1 CommentHyundai Motor (OTCPK:HYMLF) is up more than 20% in Seoul trading after the company confirmed that it is in early stage talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) about working together to develop a self-driving car, without any firm plan in place yet.Reports suggest both electric vehicle production and battery development have been discussed on an initial basis about a car that could potentially be released in 2027.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives thinks Apple is looking at a handful of strategic EV partnerships and collaborations globally with existing automakers, including Hyundai.More from Ives: ""We believe based on our investor conversations over the last few weeks that many on the Street would rather see Apple partner on the EV path, than start building its own vehicles/factories given the margin and financial model implications down the road, coupled with the strategic product risk around such a gargantuan endeavor. This speaks to our view that the chances of a strategic partnerships with the likes of a Tesla, VW, Hyundai or other auto manufacturers in China (e.g., Nio, Xpeng) are in the 70%+ range over the next few years and could lay the groundwork for a dual path (start building its own line of EV autos post 2025) over the next decade if this EV/autonomous venture is successful with consumers.""The electric vehicle sector is red hot right now off the Apple buzz and Blue sweep in DC."

"Since Jan 19th, AAPL has run 15%.Previously AAPL had pivoted four time maybe five off of $126+.No one should had not caught this action.Good Luck tomorrow"
likely a good time to buy. Will likely announce they crushed all expectations and yet the price will still drop.
"Oh my God! Investors Place dated January 22, 2021 Larry Sullivan “7 undervalued stocks that could perk up under Democratic leadership =Apple, All State, GM, Qualcomm, Cisco, Lockheed”."
"unbelievable, RED after great quarterly results."
Investors can NOT read the Earnings.
Can anyone give me a rational explanation for the stock dropping again today?
"I find it amusing to hear people asking why Apple's stock went down after announcing a terrific quarter. It's an investor's choice to pick a stock they think can make them money in as short a time as possible. It's said that Gamestock and AMC are making billionaires out of the top investors and those companies are #$%$ investments. Stock manipulation can make and break billionaires. Making money from stocks doesn't require a good company investment, sometimes it just requires good luck and maybe great risk-taking. For me, Apple is a low-risk investment that pays off year after year while Gamestock and AMC may be bankrupt companies six months from now. OK, Apple is down after a blowout quarter and that doesn't make much sense to most people in the short-term. They just see they lost some money. I just see it as a blip in a year's stock movement and how Apple is strengthening itself for the future. By any standards, Apple is making an awful lot of money and that's good for me as a shareholder. I don't have to worry about Apple going out of business soon and I'm guaranteed my dividends. As I've owned Apple since 2004, plenty of market oddities have hit Apple but Apple has always recovered. Many other stocks didn't recover. I feel certain at some point this year, the blowout quarter will boost Apple's share value when it's least expected. Patience is needed when owning Apple. It's something shareholders need to get used to instead of getting frustrated or overly concerned. Three years ago everyone was saying Apple had nothing in the pipeline but they were all wrong. Apparently, Apple can still keep secrets. Apple is busily working on projects behind the scenes and the may be game-changers for all we know.Anyway, put the holiday quarter behind and move forward. Apple is still the market cap leader by a good amount with plenty of cash to work with. Don't be too disappointed in Apple because investors didn't respond to Apple's earnings report. That's their loss because they're busy trying to fulfill their greedy nature with get-rich-quick stocks. It's nothing I want to be involved in. I prefer to own companies that have solid fundamentals and pay dividends over the long-term and that's definitely Apple.????"
"One thing I’ve learned is not to ever, ever, ever, ever worry about apple share price. It will rise again. Take a break and look back in a week or two."
If the stocks reacts this bad on the best report in it's history then there isn't much hope for the future of AAPL. The market is totally irrational and it will end badly for the gamers.
AAPL....because I love great companies.AAL....because I love watching shorts burn.
Hedge funds selling AAPL to cover losses from reddit. Stay the course on AAPL. it will recover big next week
"bought in yesterday at 127, 128, 129. anything under 130 I feel like is a great return."
I don't think that market can continue to rise at those levels with the reddit thing running in the background. We need a resolution on this.
this should easily be over 160 after this enormous ER
Apple  160 after earnings report
Anarchy will be the order of the day when people get fed up enough to push back.
CNBC is keeping Ives around for live TV damage control. Too funny.
"I will put it to you this way, if we run up 50 percent up from here say 200, you are knocking on the door of a 4 TRILLION dollar company. Seems to me that this would put it at around a 50 PE ratio and very very very expensive stock."
Remember july earning +40$
no reason for the selling. China new year and booming economy and opening stores soon and %g roll out should take AAPl tp 170
Shorted at 142 pre market nice feeling.
Went to the mall and all stores were empty with the exception of the Apple Store.
All time high ending into ER. Delicioso amigos. Roll on $150 
I have a feeling Apple is going to overdeliver tomorrow ...
"Cramer said OWN IT, DON'T TRADE IT. Don't SELL!"
Relax. Remember when it was $116?
always bad timing or bad luck on Earnings day
so what changed with Apple between the last 2 weeks and today? LOL!
I guess all these new investors have never seen an after-hours mismatch before 
Market is crashing today! I hope strong recovery tomorrow will help Apple earnings announcement.
"When news breaks tomorrow that I just ordered new M1 MacBook Air, this thing will fly. Have to admit, a bit surprised by the AH action but almost all my tickers are red today."

everyone knew the earnings report was going to be good over a week ago===>profit taking should be over by now?...
"hi guys, just read that 80% of young people trust Joe, while 50% of oldies don't. this is just boomers reacting to fox news blasting socialism fear short term."

"IDC predicts that in 2021, Apple AR glasses will trigger an explosion in the industry, and light and thin VR headsets will become the mainstream. $AAPL"
New all time high and they haven't even reported earnings yet.
AAPL’s volume is healthy. Smart money managers are moving forward with confidence.
Expect to be traded $162+ after earnings tomorrow!
"Nasdaq way down, excuse for funds to push it lower before great earnings so it can spike big time back to ""only"" $150 tmr."

"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put the odds of an Apple car unveiling by 2024 at ""35%-40%,"" given challenges on manufacturing, batteries and regulations. But he strongly believes Apple will announce an EV partnership in 2021, with Hyundai potentially the first and more to follow.Ives named Tesla (AAPL), Volkswagen (AAPL), Nio (AAPL) and Xpeng (AAPL) as potential partners on an Apple car.I Vote for $NIO + $AAPL"
the Jan 29 150 calls are in play now.....
Scoop up more at open...it's the easiest decision of my lifetime.
bucking the trend AAPl will be up 5 dollars on the confirmed news today of the Hundai partnership. AAPl will retest all time highs. thx
Apple will never let you down. Keep collecting your shares.
"Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers raised the firm’s price target on Apple to $155 from $140 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares.The China Academy of Information & Communications Technology this week released the December smartphone shipment data for December, which reflected another positive data point for Apple’s iPhone 12 cycle, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers tells investors in a research note. China total mobile phones shipped stood at 26.6M in December 2020, a decline of 13% year-over-year and 10% month-over-month, says the analyst. “Continued positive Apple data points” leaving Rakers increasingly comfortable that Apple will post upside to current expectations. He also likes the company’s “continued strong capital allocation story.”"
"“Apple's Macs enjoyed a bumper fourth quarter of 2020, according to IDC, with shipments reportedly up almost 50% year-on-year, and helping Apple to become the fastest-growing major computer vendor for the entirety of 2020.”More M series macs coming out this year, with real ‘pro’ stats. I’m personally very much looking forward to new 16 inch MacBook Pro"
A lot of drama in the comments. I have held AAPL for 15 years. It is earnings day and this normal volatility. Given the general market downturn today this is a minor dip at the end of the day. All of the guidance is good. Likely the results will be also. The world is not ending and China is not controlling the POTUS. Give me a break. It’s the stock market. If you can’t handle risk or fluctuations then go home.
The numbers are just too spectacular...we rally tomorrow....this stock is way undervalued
Power Hour has begun. Earnings to follow. $150 at open tomorrow.
"When it goes back to $138 and higher this week or next, the ones that sold will buy back! How many times have we seen this tape?"
how many know they this stock already has 95 to 105 billion plus in revenue for the quarter......we all know it....so what will amaze me is if they beat the estimated numbers which are always low balled and beat by 80% of public companies....the stock will still go up. Like  hundreds will cheer and congratulate all longs! No one will question the valuation....meanwhile Buffett sold tens of millions of shares lower than 145.
This looks like a nice buying opportunity
Well who cares anyway. I'm going to own this stock for 40 more years. Glad unlike you people I have a good job and i'm not dependent of stock volatility
It's not only AAPL it's the whole market.
"Investors have been patient.It is their time at the buffet table,""Everyone MUST wet their beak.""This past 30 days have been great.Now last time AAPL hit $134 before $138+ we suggested to sell Jan 22 covered calls to put tax deferred cash in one's pockets - 15% return on market price. Why, because the P/E hit 40. This earnings report may give us a lower P/E.Will that mean to exit that trade?Np. once the money is on your pockets; leave it there.Time is the most important variable nothing else"
"As the ""Board Historian"" allow me to discuss what has happened in the past.Except for the release of iPHONE 6, AAPL eventually pulls back each fiscal year. THis year also may be the exception.Whenever everyone is playing weekly calls for explosive rally the BIG BOYS postpone that rally until the following week. Therefore, a smart move would be to sell 50% of your positions that are probably up 200=% to date at the gap up in the am.A conservative play for whomever bought at $126,you can sell a Jan 22 $145 call for $21 tax deferred cash per share in your pockets tomorrow.. This gives you 30% return on AAPL for 2021 but you must give AAPL away at $145 + $21 = $166.It was posted ""Investors have the filed until AFTER EARNINGS. . It has had a 15% run."
If this anomaly does not reverse by mid day tomorrow than some group is manipulating this stock. With the out of this world earnings there is no reason for this retreat. It just doesn’t make sense.
The Dow is up 500? The S & P is up 42?.......I thought Dem wins were supposed to tank the market?
5% hit tonight another 5% + tomorrow. Superlative numbers are not relevant in this market.
"I'm gonna give you an opinion take it or leave it you make up your mind: tesla has been the absolute most shorted stock, like many billions lost. and with this new surge up, I believe it is due to shorts unable to take it any longer. this cannot go like this forever. at 500 post split this had a potential downfall to 300, at 850 nothings changed and the downfall is still 300. so I urge you to at least take profits. and if your a new trader do some math, you would have to reach 1600 to get 100%. I generally invest only in companies that can potentially reach 400% per year, you wont see that with tesla... on to some advice take it or leave it. #AAPL is getting into the ev spacs with hyundai spilling the beans that they are in talks with apple about batteries etc. #GOEV or canoo will be providing the skateboard and engineering services to Hyundai for their next evs and likely for Apple's. a company that has a market cap of 3 billion. now do you think a 700b company would be a better investment or a 3b company. I can see canoo going to 40 to 50b market cap pretty quickly ( next 5 years) do the math can tesla match that? are they going to be providing everything ever produced? that is where their market cap is going. I've been in canoo warrants at 1.8 and averaged up to 3.5. anything under 5 is a bargain. just some advice take it or leave it. go with your gut, your subconscious or whatever you want to call it."
Apple is definitely going to be 165-170 by Friday Munster said 200 Strap you’re self in warp speed coming
"Speculation is that markets dropped today because many hedge funds got destroyed with unexpected losses and needed to raise cash quickly, hence selling of long positions"
AAPL raised iPhone production 30% - the number will blow the lid OFF
"Today before earnings $145. After earnings $150, 2021 years end $200. Not Tesla but slow and steady with dips along the way. But future big earnings expansion with addition of smart glasses and much later Apple Car. The saga will continue! Stay long!"
Trading volume was one of the highest.....177 million on the downside. Comments?
Tomorrow we see $170.
"Here is a reality check for those thinking this stock will go to 200 and a 3.5 trillion value on roughly 300 billion in sales and a 20% net margin, 60 billion net income and 17 billion shares, EPS of 3.53. PE of 57 with a growth rate of 15%. Take a look at the last 4 years of sales. For this to make any sense, how are they going to double sales? No one at the company is talking like that. Cars....yeah....well the margin isn't going to stay at 20%. Tesla car margin is close to zero. Some think business is so easy....just say you are goign to make electric cars and in a few years 300 billion in sales? Come on. Even at 75K a car ASSUMING THEY OWN THE ENTIRE SHARE OF REVENUE....that is 4 million cars. Tesla sold 500K last year. THIS IS A BUBBLE!!!!"
Hi guys. Just checking in. I bought in at apple a month ago and my target was to make 25% over the year and I am already up 7%..not a bad return. Very happy with my investment
Ready for tomorrow?
Pretty simple stuff here kids. 10% run up the last 5 days into earnings. Profit taking (sell) on the news. The idea of the market is to make $ not spending all your time bashing each other based on if you are long or short. Been in appl for years both long and short and currently long. Great report today and won’t lose a minute of sleep because it’s down AH.
"The US stock futures sliding.Remember, crashes don't occur on Fridays. No matter how terrible tomorrow's decline will be, it will not the end. A bigger decline (crash) will follow."
Aapl up $3.00 pre market ...this could be a really good opening.
I will never buy another AAPLE product. I am currently awash in apple products. I will never buy or use another google product as well.
"Dividend pay out next week, so i expect this to jump next week. before the 8th of January record date!"
Apple Amazon sitting on the most monstrous quarters in history. Better that they lay low until then. Maybe a downgrade next week to shake the tree.
No crazy tweets to #$%$ the market now.
"Apple will go back green in the next few days. This is a joke. As an investor, what more can you want."
"So, market is UP. Fine, I have shares in 24 stocks out of which only 5 are green and that too none of them exceeds 3%. Are you kidding me? How can it be with each major index gaining more than 1%. Strange"
As I said alreadyThose who sold - do not cry nowThose who bought today - be happy :)
"Growth, growth, growth. Thank you Apple employees and loyal Apple customers!"
It won’t go below its 50 day average around $131.5. Just some profit taking after earnings combined with market dip at the end of month.
Aapl I don’t get it. Spectacular ER and stock is down when it should be up at least 5% with the market
Everyone is going to be piling into this thing trying to get a bite out of that American Apple!
With GME and AMC going down AH. That should stop having people freak and realize this hot AAPL. Money making machine.
"I mentioned in a post not too long ago that if you want to be an Apple share holder then you need to be willing to hold for the long term AND you need to have a cast iron stomach! The last 2 days with Apple shares is exactly what I was talking about. All you Apple shareholders out there, just sit tight and be strong! If you're a weak stomach bleep bleep then go sell and get the bleep out, and don't come back to the Apple family!"
"Good news is AAPL is only a few dollars away from $126.I guess everyone and everything misses ""home"".This year is almost replicating last year's action last Jan.The good news i whenever people start selling high premium puts the ""pivot"" s very near."
Lmao at hedge funds and the losses they have sustained ! It’s only funny because of how they have destroyed apples earnings day
Should be fine! Will pull a Microsoft
"It is my understanding that the peeps who jumped all over these recent high flyers--AMC-Gamestop-,,, may have had MARGIN accounts -containing AAPL-AMD ,,, and over leveraged themselves--got called on it--and now have to sell their shares in these companies --to answer the margin call!!! GREED--NO GOOD!! Just my 2 cents?? Apple--long and strong!!"
Giddy up after bell. Thumbs up for green. Thumbs down for red.
"When will market learn Apple has actually been performing far BETTER for 3 qtrs with no guidance, so they should just continue this way after pandemic"
Buying more now and if it goes into the 120's buying even more. Best Q1 report in the history of mankind will spike soon.
"If you're not buying the AAPL dip I guess you don't care about making money. That was the best quarter in the history of the Iphone and they still took AAPL down. This quarter is proving to be much like last quarter...the good quarters are being punished as if they were bad. And of course the GME short squeeze has a stranglehold on real winners such as this name. The market is long overdue for a sanity check in the bubble names like GME, AMC, BBBY, NOK, etc. AAPL will be bought back once the dust settles and the shorts who think they are winning right now will be smoked. AAPL is real gold. GME is bricks that are painted gold."
this is one I never worry about . Long term green hold.
"On days like this, it's best to turn your screens off and not look at the price. Just remember the fundamentals of the company are exceptional and the company will be announcing new products in the coming years. With Apple, you always win long term. Even the greedy hedge fund managers and MM's can't manipulate the price if you hold long term. No super computer or other advantage they have can beat a long term holder."
"Shorts are getting rich this week taking all the longs money ...enjoy shorties while it lasts , next week you will be fried ..."
"After blowout ER, AAPL’s usual MO is to drift upward over the course of the qtr, just enough and under the radar to gratify patient longs, and frustrate weekly option gamblers..."
"I don’t care what anyone says, apple will be 200$ a share by the end of this year. you decide what you do from now til then, but don’t be surprised when it happens."
get on the boat before earnings or you will be left waving goodbye from the dock!
"AAPL will hit $200.00 after earning, for sure!"
"Apple will be up just as much as MSFT, if not more after earnings."
Let’s say apple knocks it out of the park on earnings. How much is already baked into the price?
Apple  reports right around 430pm good luck to all remember long and strong
"Apple is expected to have finished 2020 with its most profitable quarter ever, and possibly its first with more than $100 billion in quarterly sales. The period was fueled by an uptick in higher-end iPhone sales and a pandemic-induced surge in demand for its laptops and tablets."
We wont have corrections until retail traders refuse to be hedged by market makers selling them puts $GME $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT $FB
Apple long to $200.
"Microsoft had a stellar quarter reported after hours on Tuesday and they dropped like a rock on Wednesday, today Thursday looks like Microsoft is heading back up. Speculation can have an affect but solid fundamentals will win out in the longer term."
With the surplus of cash in the economy and diminishing returns of bank interest rates money will continue to rotate into the market. Apples prospects make it a safe haven for this money - $140 imminent.
Bought a January 29 170 call option. Feeling pretty optimistic this cracks 170 after earnings. Thoughts?
Still going down
I will be praying for my apple stock this weekend. kindly do same
Market sell-off so investors have more money to pour into Apple after the bell tonight.
$140. Hello
"Finally, market makes some sense and rewarding profitability. I knew eventually market will go back to fundamentals and amazon is really undervalued right now!"
I’ve bought all the apple I can ! I’m now fully invested ! Start buying people before this opportunity passes you by ! When the short squeeze is over the hedge funds will be buying back !
After hours trading my new prediction is for 162.00 plus
I repeat $400 on it's way
easy to cancel Facebook and Twitter. apple on the other hand won't feel anything from this
"The selling in shares like AAPL, AMZN, etc was liquidation to pay for the margin calls.There is still an outstanding debt of over 100 billion dollars that needs to be balanced.The short big boys got their heads lopped off.The real estate crisis we had was about 80 billion dollars. This will be more damaging and the effects will last far longer. Many of the players willnot exist in a few months. No bail outs this time."
"Lets state facts. Apple may hit 130 today. We are in the middle of reddit revolution and it may lead to a correction. hold the stock we will be fine. Yes it hurts, we know this."

Anyone know the time apple reports ? thanks
wow they have this pinned in a 2 dollar range 138-140..... it will have to break out above or below the range today. need to see which way the market trades. right now looks ok but if it reverses apple will be down to 134 easy....

I am thinking the sell off was precipitated by short sellers liquidating their positions from profitable companies to be able to cover their margin expenses. This should start heading towards a 3 trillion+ market cap by next week.
Buy now before it hits 150
150 by Friday. Just watch. Dios like this on earning are expected. They had the perfect report. Just wait this it start sinking. Been doing this for a while.
"Truly amazing!Before earnings, the Jan 29 $130/$135 call spread was 80% at $4.Here we are!"

Do NOT forget that Apple’s Q2 will include 3 full months of 12 Phone Sales instead of 2 months.......AND almost ALL of the Holiday Gift Cards will be redeemed and counted as Sales in Q2. Q2 will be another grand slam blowout quarter.

The strong growth is expected to be driven by a huge jump in iPhone sales. Analysts estimate iPhone sales to have grown by nearly 7% to $59.8 billion.""""But it isn't just the iPhone that is supposed to see big growth, with services soaring by 16.5% to $14.8 billion, while wearables jump by 19.4% to $11.9 billion. But what may be even more important is second quarter guidance. The company has been hesitant to provide forward guidance over the past few quarters. Guidance would certainly give investors the confidence that perhaps management is gaining some better visibility. Signaling that perhaps the worst of the pandemic's economic crisis is behind the company. Analysts are looking for fiscal second quarter revenue of $74.5 billion and earnings of $0.91 per share."" Good Luck"
any idea why this would pull back before earnings?? people taking profits? not aware of blow out coming?
We soar like eagles tomorrow morning...see ya all at $150 and beyond!
"The Earnings “Event” is over, never hold after the party is over.Food and booze is gone, you can clean the dirty dishes and pick up the cups132Buy here"
can it be $500 already so we can see it split again
I guess 155$ after market easily
"Apple is a business, not a stock. If your pizza business sales surpassed expectations, and your partner offered you less for your stake, you'd laugh? If Apple stock goes down, start laughing. Apple is great!"
Holding thru tech earnings....you need a lobotomy. 3 times in 4 it gets beat up. Just sell it at 3:50pm and buy it back cheaper the next day. Pocket the difference or buy more shares. The risk to reward ration just isn’t there. You need PERFECTION on the report AND markets moving higher. Rarely happens. It’s just not worth holding.
Don't Panic ladies. A greener closing today and much more greener tomorrow 
Look at a 10 day chart. Apple is not down. CNBC is a TRADERS news platform. They're talking about it being down as if it didn't run from $128 to $145 since Jan 20th
I bought this and added to it on margin at 144. Any idea when I will see gains again?
Talking about rigged mkt where aapl company made record amount of money but retail investors get punished by manipulating mms. Why big investors and CNBC are so upset about retail investors screwing the hedge funds in GME ;Everyday they screw us in mkt So what’s the difference between GME . I don’t own gme but I’m glad these small investors made or making tons of money going against short sellers.
"Scare tactics. This drop is directly correlated to what’s happening in the broader markets and the fact we just had earnings. Give it a few days, we promise"
A global pandemic and they have their biggest quarter *ever*
Will sell my Apple shares in the coming Monday.
"80 Million Never Trumps, Rule The Roost !"
Nice to see AAPL gaining.Unfortunately the increased taxes levied on capital gains will the little guys.
"I would never short apple, but I think this is too much? Why does it have a 40 PE ratio? It historically was between 10-20. Can anyone explain?"
Relax! IT is AAPL's natureLook at the past few monthsSEp 01: $134.18SEp 23: $107.12DEc 20: $134.87Jan 05: $126.38Jan 25: $145.17
It took a few years to get to the top of the mountain and now it looks like AAPL going back down the the other side of the mountain. It was a nice run but it may be time to move on.
Why this is happening? There is no bad news today and the whole market dropped. People are selling because they are just blinded by the tricks streets uses all the time. Can someone please tell me why anyone would sell AAPL now knowing the earnings is coming within 2 weeks.
See yall at 155

$145 tomorrow baby!
Tomorrow at this time apple will be up 7-8% in AH
Everything is going to be alright! Going to make some money...
"$GM $F $TSLA $AAPL $XLE $OXY $XOM & $CVX Don’t fall for the whole “OIL IS DEAD JUNK”. We will transition to green energy over the next 20 years.

its oversold now after the record earnings just buy and hold and be rewarded. down close to 10% correction is healthy. they want your cheap shares to cover their shorts and go long to the new pt targets 150-160.
ACCUMULATE NOW. SMART MONEY GAME...YOU BUY BUY
Long term play sell 150$
Needham BUY and target 170 - the first of many to come .
It’s valuation is absolutely justified now by its earning and the future. Actually it’s undervalued. If you want to talk about apple’s valuation then look at Tesla.
Think about this Apple blows away earnings for holidays stock is taking a hit in 2 days. That’s holidays biggest earnings now what ?? If this is down with great earnings now what
"Does AAPL plan on using the electric generating glass from CVUEF to power the next generation iPhones,iPads,computers or electric cars?"

"@Anonymous silence...we haven't forgotten what you said yesterday. you said ""$120 tomorrow"" so what happened?"
I got a feb 26 call that’s already itm. Does it make sense to get a put for this Friday incase it drops after earnings ? Let me hear your opinions
I wonder how much stimulus is headed straight to Apple products.
tomorrow regular hours up $5.....after hours up $20
"There is some concern that Apple's share price will climb into earnings and then pull back. In my view, the prior will not repeat in 2021 Apple's new mobile supercycle and the underlying evolution of EV and AI will hold up the share price and bring about a bigger share price for Apple than last year and another possible share split approx end of this year.The opportunity for an exceptional new high before the end of January remains very positive with only one more day to go to set another new trend for the year."
Canoo $GOEV had talks with $AAPL to help create their EV car
Once the hype over GameStop is over. People will be taking their money and investing it in companies that actually make money like Apple.

Will AAPL hit $145 after earnings on Jan 27?
Could end higher by $6-$8 range today
New price target is $155.00
I used to laugh at the guys claiming to be up a million from apple...now I'm one of them. Life changing decision to buy it. The crazy thing is the future still looks bright. Could the best be yet to come?
APPLE  is one of best stock.
Almost $2 up already over bottom!
Im glad Tim Cook didn’t give guidance last call. Keeps everyone guessing.
I sold some of my AAPL position yesterday morning and added to my NVAX position. Should have moved more. Have no regrets.
"I agree with Kevin, in regard to pre market numbers. Unless there is a major crises pre market in its low trade numbers is almost irrelevant. Apple daily volume is over 100 million and pre market at most is 1-2% of that volume. I find it almost inconceivable for AAPL not to gain today, it just doesn’t make any sense. Earnings yesterday is the envy of any and all major world conglomerates. With that in mind I am on record that AAPL will gain today."
"AS I read this board, all I hear is ""options"".Maybe this is my fault, discussing 1000% returns in four days. 100% everyday.As the board historian, let me share my experiences with AAPL, Many times, AAPL can go up or down in price yet both the calls and puts fall in value. Why? The premium erodes once the earnings are released.ALso, when everyone is on the same side of the trade the markets kill the action. One time , earnings were great yet the market postponed the rally until the calls expired for the next week.As posted last night, After today's am rally, you may want to sell half of your position to pocket yo recover principle and some profits.Yes, we did post Investors have the filed until AFTER earnings. But this is an entire different subject"
Always right before earnings unbelievable Scams but Apple is holding
You might be right. Robinhood is stopping sales of GameStop for the safety of the company.
Buy and Hold
"Apple longs know not to panic on days like today. The drop is due to options and day traders. These dips are opportunities to accumulate. When a company has solid fundamentals and record setting earnings and growth, you know you have a good investment. Just ask anyone who's been holding for 5+ years. Own it don't trade it."
Did it really go over $139 or no? I was away today.
"Best results ever and down.. nowadays, we are in a Casino?"
Apple and Hyundai confirmation news starting to spread...awesome! Self driving car will be manufactured in US agreement to be signed in March. This is a game changer!

Before advice to short or Something elle look Tesla is doing the same as Apple
See! Don’t let pre market scare you. Apples  gona rock today!
"Weak hands are selling, this stock will rise up to 150 soon."

New all time high ! yessssssss !
"Perhaps the hedge funds had to sell off their longterm Apple stock to cover for the losses incurred by GME short squeeze? Once this phenomenon subside, Apple price will shoot up to a new high."

Opinions on possibility of an apple search engine to rival google?
do I smell green
market didn’t react much to intel sales increasing 33%
"Apple sold 18M iPhone 12 units in the China market in Q4, exceeding expectations and achieving over 20% market share, DigiTimes reports.The impressive Q4 sales dented the market share numbers for Huawei, Kiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo, which accounted for more than 90% of China's smartphone market before the iPhone series launch. In Q4, their combined share fell to ~78%, according to the DigiTimes report.Momentum is seen continuing through the Lunar New Year holiday, bringing Q1 2021 volumes level with Q4 2022 shipments, MacRumors reports."
Massive revenue beat. Should go to $200 easy now.
"The M1 is killing the Hackintosh community, elevating the video editing community, destroying reliance’s on intel and amd. There’s absolutely no doubt that Apple is on the cusp of a revolutionary change for their product line with the release of the M1. It’s not even their best chip play this year and it’s stellar as heck."
Some strong selling today keeping the price down. Wonder who is selling and why? I would imagine for diversification. But The Who question remains unless hedge funds maybe to cover certain shorts. Stay long stay strong 
Lol just scaring you before good results and then it gets right back up.
Glad FB is up 4% but not Apple the best company in the market. Absurd
They’re trying to hold it down before earnings. They’re still trying to get your shares. Hold don’t sell!
"What’s the over under on job losses his first full month? He’s at a million after his first week. I’m going with 7 million, has a nice ring"

Has anyone else noticed there is always something negative about the market when Apple earnings are due?
"MASA has changed his name to Jack, because Yahoo removed MASA from the blog because of his abusive posts, Beware"
what not to like?--Revenue: $111.44 billion versus $103.12 billion expected--Earnings per share: $1.68 versus $1.42 expected--iPhone revenue: $65.68 billion versus $60.33 billion expected--Service revenue: $15.76 versus $14.89 billion expected
"I've bought and sold Apple over the years. After the 7 for 1 split, I bought to hold longterm and have added 20-50 shares every time I sold another stock. I'm still holding and adding, and now have over 2,000 shares. There are 29 stocks in our portfolio and Apple is one of 3 that is absolutely not for sale. The other 2 are Microsoft and Target."
I believe Apple will be green before the end of the day.
What is going on with the market today?
200 by October
Shorts will cover at the end of the day and we will hit 137.00
"AAPL - - - - buy PUT target price $112 for next 4 week , GUARANTEE , Guess why ...?.."
Don’t sell! This is only due to Hedge funds selling to cover GameStop and other short losses . It will rebound when this lunacy is over...
This is very scary right now
"STOP WHINNING, same old AAPL earnings release pattern, a dip then up to new highs. AAPL should hit 160 next week"
We’ll end up red for sure. I knew this was too good to be true.
Greatest company in the world. Their earnings report next month will show why
"Apple is the future , own only 500 shares. Not taking profit. This is a 20 year hold stock."
I don't really care if the price goes up after earnings report because I'm not selling any of my shares for at least 5 to 7 years anyway.

Apple stock price prediction for 2025?
Sounds like a good short squeeze coming tomorrow. Send aapl to 155.
Do you think this might drop to 130 for the opening price?
"Agreed! Apple did announce ramping ramping up production.""Apple's iPhone Sales Could Blow Up in This Market in 2021""""A huge jump in 5G smartphone sales in this market could be a boon for Apple.""Jan 26, 2021 at 10:28AM""The iPhone 12 lineup has generated impressive sales for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the company is expected to raise production significantly in 2021 to meet the strong demand for its 5G-enabled offerings. That's not surprising, as Apple had a huge installed base of users ready to upgrade to 5G-capable smartphones -- and the company gave them a great reason to make the jump with the well-priced iPhone 12 lineup."""
High volume is a good sign for AAPL to continue up. GLTA
Apple is nearing $2.5 trillion market cap. Trailing is Microsoft half a trillion behind. AAPL long the beautiful journey continues. Stay long and celebrate.
"That's according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. On Tuesday, Ives raised his price target on Apple stock from $150 to $160 -- but outlined a bull case for it to climb as high as $200. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 7% over the stock's closing price on Tuesday of about $124"

Some are predicting a $100+/- billion dollar quarter. Apple is currently paying a .82 dividend (.60%). Things that make you go HUMMMMM!
Seems like there will be a big correction
"Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty and team have a few thoughts on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) potential venture into the automobile industry.""A noticeable percentage of Apple revenue in any given year comes from products and services that didn’t exist 3 to 5 years ago. An important point when you start thinking about Car and Health and AR.""""Investors never credit Apple with the revenue coming on the back of $20bn+ of annual R&D investments… including investing in new areas like autos.""""Apple has a user base of about 1 billion installed iPhones, last reported to be growing at around 9% annually. So when Apple users buy multiple products (iPhone + Airpods + watch + Mac) the churn essentially goes to zero. This is very relevant when we talk about entering new categories like Car.""Huberty also notes that Apple would only have to nab 2% auto mobility market share to match its iPhone revenue.She also thinks Apple is more likely to vertically integrate in auto due to its existing tech (operating system, processors, battery, cameras and displays), instead of striking partnerships.What about margins? Huberty says Apple would only make a move if it could generate double-digit margins at scale with long-term upside. As for timing, an Apple Car isn't anticipated for four or five years.On risk to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Huberty thinks the pair could grow the market together and doesn't expect a Blackberry-type flameout when Apple enters the market.Apple Car developments and potential auto-tech partnerships are expected to be a big theme in 2021."
Absentee Voting by Smart Phone ?Finger Print Recognition ?Problem Solved !
"A $1,400 stimulus check would be nice. Can use it to buy ten more shares of AAPL. Funny thing is that there are so many of us ( probably a majority of us)that have been working all along and have suffered no financial hardship what-so-ever due to the pandemic. The money will be saved or invested and will not do anything to stimulate the economy. Granted the money will be great for those who really need it. Apparently it would not be politically do-able if they didn't give it to everybody."
177 Million shares - huge volume on down day !!!!No good !!!Buy 126-127 for a bounce.

I've already emailed Etrade about it and I'm still waiting for a reply. I don't want to sell at such a steep loss. Any thoughts on this? I just started trading options and did very well with Apple, Ford and blackberty a last week. I got excited expecting a good return based on Apple's earnings expectations. Did not expect a company with such amazing earnings to drop. Lesson learned"
Question: where will you be when Apple  hits $150? It’s not far away!

I added to my long position that has been growing since my first buy in 2016. I have been waiting for a pull back like this to add. Messes up my nice and low cost basis but this is my best and largest holding. Glad to throw more money into it on the pull back. Long core holding and best stock next to my amazon and microsoft and LAM Research.
Bullish handle on the cup forming at exactly the right time.
A house does not count down the tree that gives it shade.$126 has been the line in the sand - the pivot.Eight trading days until earnings - 1/27.I think the time for trading is now suspended. Everyone got fat at the table anyway.Stay long
its only going up from now on.will close 134.50. calls will expire.next week fresh money in the stock and back to 145 in the first 2 days
With almost 59 millions in Traded. Can’t even stay put around 131. The question of the day is: why are people still selling AAPL?
Apple shares are doing exactly what it did after the last time it split back in 2014. Back then after splitting Apple just sat there and went NOWHERE for almost a year. I practically pulled my hair out and it took great restraint on my part in not selling. I didn't sell and Apple eventually resumed its climb around 2015. History repeats itself...
Apple has sold the most call options today on the market for going up next week!
Apple is forever a worthy brand and it is always best for investors. No other brand can come closer to it.
Apple Is going to have a major pull back like last earnings dropped 20 dollars in 2 days
"I am absolutely convinced that these green whack job environmentalist won’t be satisfied until we’re all living in caves again, emitting zero carbon."
Family added - Two IPHONE 12's with all the fixings today......
What was the after hours close?
"Going to $175 folks, better add to your positions now!!! BUY!!!!"
160.00 is coming. after aapl reports over 100 billion revs.
Seems like 150 at tortoise close before earnings :)
"Hi I am new here. I would like to get in and get little bit Apple stock in my portfolio. But to be honest, my ideal buying price is around 128$. Now is about 132$. Should I start a small amount today or better wait till Monday and see what’s going on ? Thanks!"
GameStop and amc getting all the attention today. The closer we get to the close market will focus on apples  earnings. Hold tight.
"As a AAPLE shareholder , 17,000 , this is my earnings forecast, earnings 1.71, & revenue 112 billion "
Once the BIG BOYS are done accumulating today...this will turn GREEN!!
A great idea to give sanctuary to refugees but first take care of our beloved seniors and beloved disabled people by increasing S.S. Pay and reversing certain unjust laws which affects people’s S.S.
WOW AAPL CLOSING $5.20 DOWN IN A SINGLE DAY
AAPL is a pleasure to own. Tim Cook is the world’s best driver who is taking us for a joy ride up up up! Having fun? GLTA
Holding strong 
"What many of you seem to be missing is the new rising tax burden on corporations and individual investors (YOU) is going to weigh heavy on the market. It doesn’t matter how much money a company makes if the government takes away most of it. I remain LONG Apple, but I am not optimistic."
"Tim cook getting a bonus for the first time, should tell you everything about the ER"
This is going to be +5% today
"Don't let them scare you, wait and see what Apple would reward your faith. Just hold and be patient."
green from here into the close then AH the big price jump
buy on the today's dip. be patient. TODAY WILL END RED.
"With Today's RBC Captital Upgrade and Apple reported ramping up production and earnings coming up, Apple a buy the dip.""Apple to ramp up iPhone production for 2021, plans to produce up to 230 million units""2 minute read Apple iPhones Author Maaz Ahmed""Apple has asked its iPhone suppliers to ramp-up production, as the American tech giant plans to manufacture up to 96 million iPhones for the first half of 2021, according to a report by Nikkei. If the target numbers are met, they would account for about 30% YoY increase."" Bullish. Good Luck"
Highest Close on AAPL was 136.69.... Until todayWe are in Breakout mode.... Giddy-UP
125 billion in sales for the quarter would be insanity. 20% margin 25 billion profit....17 billion shares is 1.47 EPS
Guidance conservative as usual though company must expect continued strong sales of 5G phones into 3rd Q.
Credit suisse just raised aapl target price to $140 from $120
Shorts are doing everything they can to drop the stock or keep it in an area they feel they have a Chance of not loosing their shirts come earnings. Regardless they will all loose this month. Wells Fargo $155.00 
Holding and watching my portfolio climb and climb.
Thumps up if this is a buying opportunity
Buy High and Let it Fly! Apple on a tear and $150 now on the radar screen in lieu of a blockbuster ER. 
its only a loss if you sell it. just buy the dips people. once it turns it turns fast in either direction. the way the market trades now the dips happen fast to panic selling. the RH traders are on to this manipulation by the big boys.
Apple need to give all of their shareholders a voucher for a dozen rolls of antacids right before they announce quarterly earnings!
Apple is America!
"Buckle your seat belts folks, it's going to be a fun ride this week!"
We’ve fallen off the support cliff Where o where will we land I’m still bullish long term so buy and hold for the future people !
155 is seeming more and more possible!
Still going to $160.
"Not sure why everyone’s ripping on this stock, it has delivered 20 plus (average) annually consistently.invest and leverage, let the compound interest build up for the next 20 years and you’ll be a millionaire depending how much you put in haha"

"what's fugazy is AMC is up 300% from reddit, and Apple blows away earnings and can't stay above a downside close.."
New PT $170 from Cascend
Why would anyone sell before earnings this is going to $160??
Thanks for following my posts on Apple. Now the stock has come down to minor support near 126. If the stock price holds here we are fine and it will again test the highs. Now on the other hand if we break this support area standby until the stock stabilizes before pulling the trigger...
AAPL WILL NEVER GOING DOWN ITS MANIPULATE COMPANY . EVEN IF THE MARKET GOING DOWN 2.000 POINTS AAPL LOSE ONLY $1 OR $.2
Looks like $130 0r $131 for today!
Will someone just buy some shares at $140? :)
"Revenue beat by 8 billion, who else can do that?"
Just wait until all the upgraded price targets for AAPL come in after that earnings beat! The share price will jump up after every new price upgrade that comes in!
...and BOOM. Just like that. longs are back !!!!
So RH only allows you to buy one share. How do all you Robin Hood kids feel now. You better prey RH doesn’t go BK. If they do kiss your accounts and money goodbye. So happy I never opened up an account with that gong show platform.$GME $AMC $NIO $PSTH $AAPL $TSLA
I am dumping my Apple stock and wish anyone holding it best of luck and I hope you make a fortune.Apple deciding to clamp down on free speech does not align with my values.https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2021/01/08/apple-to-parler-crack-down-on-free-speech-or-face-ban/
"tomorrow, the AAPL casino opens for betting, up or down?"
Is it going to lose all the gains of last 5 days? I should have sold it last night.
"Apple going this high is scary . It brought the whole market down in sept. When it hit 138.Do you think we are in a bubble? Cathy wood doesn’t, think so , and she is a lot smarter than me ,there's so may people warning we are at a top ."
"The smart investor will jump on this while it's still at 140 because in one month it will be $165, mark this post!!!"
I get it... this is just because AAPL reported exceptionally good earnings!! Crazy market ... over 10$ down from before the earnings :(
"I’m not saying that AAPL will get to 3 trillion soon, but do you guys think AAPL will be the first to get there?"
Great quarter for AAPL. More upgrades coming in the A.M.!!!
$155 after earnings.
Thanks for the buying opportunity!
You guys know what to do when there is fear in the market.. act and buy.. don’t miss it again
"Not one Analyst on WS has the balls to call out this outrage– that Apple Inc posted 33 Billion net profits for the quarter and the stock gets sold off. Meanwhile, a zombie company that has been a has-been for the last 5 years–sees its stock explode to the upside with complete unjustified valuations. Something is very wrong here."
"Over 60% of this stock is owned by institutions. They bought more last week. Do you really think they are going to let their investments drop even further, especially right before earnings are released. It looks really bad for them, they will push the price up this week."
"report isn't even out yet, patience"
Buy now or wait after earnings?
"I'm not often a bag holder but when I am, I'm holding AAPL!!! Looks like I'm going to be holding 1000 shares for a quarter or two. Oh well!"
I'm in at 137$ only 8 shares. long and will be adding
Richie Rich the shorter not happy today. Never underestimate Apple...
Apple bears wrong again for the 3rd consecutive decade . Truly sad!
"Hedge fund squeeze continues. They’re selling out of Apple to cover their shorts. No way Apple should open this low today. Buying opportunity, period."
I expect AAPL will be back over 137 by close today
Tomorrow it will be trading high!
This week stock price did new ATH. It’s gonna be good signal despite drop these days.
When Apple  hits $160 $143 will look like a bargain
SEC does nothing for the individual investor. They make rules to allow big business to cheat investors. How about the same access and rules for everybody?
Come together and be the rally ! Buy apple and hold apple 
If you could own only one stock for the next 15 years would Apple? If not what stock would it be?
"Wallstreet shorting apple on the news is typical. I hope wallstreetbets army make them pay by buying apple. If then Robinhood bans apple trading, they are in a big trouble."
We should see $140+ next week. Massive call buying at every strike up to 140 for February 5th expiration. You should buy the hell out of this stock next week!
"CRUSHED the numbers. Revenue: $111.44 billion versus $103.12 billion expected, Earnings per share: $1.68 versus $1.42 expected iPhone revenue: $65.68 billion versus $60.33 billion expectedService revenue: $15.76 versus $14.89 billion expected"
"I have bought in at 132 and 128..I will buy all dips..remember I am a new one and investor to apple and my target is to make a 25% return.. Will keep you all posted.. My next buy in, if it drops that low would be 119."
Why would anyone short this?
I’ll buy at 100 it’s price in 7 days after the coming crash
AAPL had its best quarter in India They will be announced tomorrow at earnings
Sign of things to come under sleepy Joe and their socialist agenda. Wait for 15 min wage and economy will really tank
"Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty on Thursday reiterated her Overweight rating on Apple stock and lifted her price target to $152 from $144. She writes that her checks find that Apple saw strength across its products and services portfolio in the quarter, driven by 5G iPhone adoption, the work-and-learn-from-home trend, and sustained engagement with the App Store."
out of curiosity does everyone here know that they are investing in a company which had to put suicide nets into its factories?Is everyone cool with that? Let's continue then...
apple is being strong armed by the big hedge funds to bring the price down so they can steal our hard earned money and buy it back 10 or 20% cheaper hey look you know Apple is a two trillion dollar it just had a great earnings report so why would a person sell it other then if you really need the money to pay bills other wise or your a short but besides that there is no reason to give these big hedge fund your money this stock should be at about 160 to 180 a share these hedge fund need to be taught a lesson like the reddit community is doing to game stop
Should’ve bought GameStop SMH
"I plan on accumulating sub $145 hoping for $155, what you all think?"
Don’t get it
"Big money can apply downward pressure to AAPL at will. They do it on any given Friday for OpEx profit. When they do it on no news days like today, it’s to accumulate for major event—ER"
Downvote me all you want but with the Buffett indicator higher than 2007 we all know who will be the last one laughing.
Shorts should really check Apples RSI OVERSOLD PEOPLE !!!
Guaranteed $134's tomorrow !
How is this NOT UP?
Is it worth buying at this dip?
"Definitely $400 on it’s way. No doubt in my mind. Stay focused on December 31, 2021"
Bought 50 share of Apple first time I just have to be a part of a Trillion Dollar company 
"Rallied around 10, then changed course again, options in control for now!"
The $140s won’t last long!
"Trend of three!Last two days, Rally at open, dip then closes in green"
You are being offered a gift. Will you take it?
Apple will be the first $3 Trillion company after the ER next week...SPY will be over 400
"On a serious note, do you guys think it will go up tomorrow or be down?"
Fun Coupons !
wow! What a day for apple!!
"Price target upgrades today 150.,160 170."
"When was the last time you saw someone NOT wearing a mask in public? It's been well over 6 months for me, if not longer. I've asked friends and relatives in other states, and their experience is the same. Yet we have MORE infections and deaths than last year despite CNN, MSNBC, Huffington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR, etc etc telling us all we had to do was wear masks and no one would get infected. There's been side by side comparisons of counties of similar population sizes that mandated masks versus those that did not, and the infection and death rates are about the same. Hmmmmmm."
Join me in a big WOW!
"With AAPL, performance is not reflected in shareprice—maybe only factors in a tiny 10%—only used as leverage by institutions who own the most shares to control the other 90%"
"I have posted more than once on this page in regard to pullback, Rule of Thumb: check AAPL quote daily of course, but to truly measure AAPL progress make it a point to check quotes on an exact by-weekly basis and realize how beautifully AAPL is gaining in value."
if msft earnings are any indication aapl should blow away earnings. This stock after hours and throughout the day tomorrow is going to explode.
just give aapl a day or 2 and it'll start right back in again going back up north...
today apple jumped due to microsoft.
"bought 40 shares @128$, will this ever see 150$?"
Apple should hit $150 by this Friday. There will be upgrade reports issued soon.
Go Apple! 
"I am sad, I bought 500 shares of apple just before the ER and I am in the hole $9K...life has no meaning and ......except China virus"
Just wait until the 100 billion dollar quarter is announced. This thing going to 160 real soon...
Absolutely insane. Why negative in stock price with 111 billion in sales?
"I've been reading the board w/o commenting,But I want to echo what was posted last WEekend.WE posted that the traders had the filed for a month while the investors waited for their turn which WE said was this week until after earnings.Today I read many discussing options. Since Tuesday's open the weekly calls are up as much as 1000%. The $130 calls were .65 on Tuesday morning..today they are over approx. $7. Some returns were so much higher.Then the sale of puts was a slam dunk.Tomorrow for our UNITY to stand fast there will be no pullback."
bought 132.01 ....
"The consensus EPS Estimate is $1.41 and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $103.24B (+12.4% Y/Y).Analyst expects iPhone sales of $59.86B, Mac $8.68B, iPad $7.61B, Wearables, Home and Accessories $11.91B.Analysts expect Apple’s services revenue to increase to $14.9 billion in Q1 FY 2021, its highest level in at least four years. expect Apple to beat last year’s Q1 results in every category — by roughly 13% on the top and bottom lines."
After quarterly results apple normally goes up in 2 weeks etc

Best advice I can give on an unsubstantiated selloff. Buy and/or turn the ticker off. Check back in six months.

I’ve worked hard to accumulate 2307 shares and I’m not giving in and selling any. I can’t wait for the next split. 9200 shares. Holding for 5-10 years. Don’t need the money. Still 60k in the green. Sleep well longs
Wedbush just raised target price to 175 get ready to run
Why does WS now hate capitalism?Apple 1st quarter net profit is $33.6 billion. That's not annual net–but a single quarter net profit. WS hates winners.
Bought this stock back in the days $3500 worth of Apple stocks .... after splits I’m now sitting at $1.3 Million! I’m not selling but what’s happening right now is really scary! Big hedge funds are selling tech stocks and shorting the market to make up the losses from meme stocks like GME AMC etc etc. they will force retail investors to sell .... don’t come with the “hold don’t sell” people get very emotional when seeing red days... meaning a gap down on Monday can easily cause a crash! Don’t forget that Robinhood is limiting buying but you can sell all your portfolio. This is a trap! Trade wisely!
A message to all retail traders ! Shift the short squeeze from GameStop to apple and the system would not be able to shut you down ! They would have no control and the hedge funds would pay a heavy price for robbing us common folk !
Up 11% (+$200B in market cap) in 5 days on no news. When did AAPL turn into another Ponzi scheme?
"Why invest in stocks, when a company (Apple) makes money, blows out earnings only see see stock get hammered!"
Apple $500 in 6 months
"Is there a dividend coming in March ??? Usually they put out a notice, but haven't seen anything !"
This will run up to earnings!
"$AAPL reports BOGUS revenues with ""accounting magic"". However, even those BOGUS revenues are NOT enough to justify current ABSURD Valuation!AAPL has $35.00 fair value!"
Apple will be 175+ by the time they announce the Apple Car in March
This ride up is so well-deserved. I’m so lucky to own a part of the best company in the world. Stay long the best is yet to come...
This is a temporary drop. Aapl is just too strong. I am long forever!!
"Apple is the safest investment out there. its recession proof. Even if apple fans have no cash left, they would still max out their credit cards and wait in line 5 hours to purchase the latest overpriced gadget."
Any suggestions on a covered call option on AAPL? Have a large position and want to get some income from it.
Green on a -400 Dow and -170 Nasdaq. Nice.
stock is down because of the giant options position at 135 expiring today
It’s a great time to be an Apple investor! 500 EOy!
"Apple is creating a buy-in point. Let history be your guidance, Apple always erupts 2-6 days after earnings. Patience folks and you will be rewarded."
"Just earnings will lift Apple  to all new highs, just think what the guidance will do for the rest of the year! Then on top of that Apple  could announce new products."
"Just want to let the bears know, it’s been fun battling and bickering with you guys these last few days! It’s been fun watching the ticker and seeing how sideways the action has been in the trenches! No hard feelings at all to any you guys as humans, it’s just business."
"bought 13 TSLA at 488 post split, sold at 843 bought APPL at 127. I feel better holding and accumulating a real business."
Welcome to Wall Street manipulation my friends. Even the little hard working guys knew AAPL would beat expectations. What they didn't know was how to play the real game.....set....match...
How you not buy AAPL when Pelozi with inside info is buying it... we are going to $200 in 2021

"A new CBS interview and video claim Apple will make a 'big announcement' on Wednesday about a ""major new initiative"" that will be ""bigger and better than a new product.In the video, CBS Gayle King speaks briefly with Cook following violence at America's Capitol building last week. Cook stated in response to the attack that it was key ""people be held accountable for it"" and that the event was something we should be ""very serious about."" More interestingly, at the end of the segment, King stated that Cook had actually interviewed with CBS about a different topic, a ""big announcement"" coming Wednesday, January 13."
Good Luck
AAPL could literally come out with a toilet seat tomorrow and sell millions. This is a buy and hold and continue to accumulate and reinvest the dividends for life and then pass along to your children when you’re gone.
"I already earned 10k with Apple in December what else to hope for its like I got the 150 price everybodys hoping for already. Bought new 27 inches Mac, iPad and iPhone watch."
Will turn GREEN today on analyst upgrades today!!!! Wait and see!!!
Could hit $150 before close tomorrow.
OPINION ---- Options: Sept. 2022 strike 130 and 140 --- Hold until after earnings? or sell prior?
AAPL should hit a new high on Tuesday or Wednesday next week following its same old earnings release pattern of dip then new high.
150 by earnings.
140 tomorrow mark my words
Hey amazing traders. Stop crying. This was $106-110 after split briefly not that long ago.
"Reason to stay long. Up days on no news. Manipulated now with fantastic earnings.... don’t bail , wait, even a few weeks"
10 Days until earnings!! Can't wait for all of you to come back on this message board and say you shouldn't have sold me your shares for dirt cheap so I could get richer. I am planning on buying a new car with the money so let me say thank you in advance!!
I bought apple 20 years ago.....I am a believer and expect the stock to see 200 again in 2021
Wow Jesus is my lord 400 for sure! That makes me a millionaire along with a lot of other Apple  shareholders all I did was put 90k in Apple in 2014 when I sold our home! What a amazing blessing Apple has been ! Will never sell!!will split again just be patient!!
It bumped up against 145 four separate times.That was the hgh for the next few years or possibly longer.This was their big quarter and it's all down hill from here.
The volume is very strange and low for the day after earnings!
Slowly slowly everything is turning positive. So stay focused and stay invested just like me. Additionally years and years of investing experience tells me to stay invested and focused
Sometimes I wish Apple  would report earnings in the morning before the bell. My accounts not set up for after hour trading.
"You would think everyone would be pumping last second additions of this company to their profile before earnings tomorrow but it seems we have an adverse affect here. However after seeing Nasdaq, SP and Dow you can see that half the market is tanking and half the market is rising. This is more broad than just Apple, it’s something else. I’m holding all my shares and calls (calls will be executed come Thursday for me). I see no problems here, just a matter of time really. GLTA and hold! SCARED MONEY MAKES NO MONEY!"
$100+ B quarter.........soon trillion qtr.
After earnings this is 175
Apple has gone up 100 fold since 2004. All I ask is that it kindly do the same in the next 10 years.
"Welcome to Joes economy. Overall, lost almost 15% this week, but I'm holding."
It’s days like this that remind me why I shouldn’t look at the market every day.

"Hold onto your seat belts, ladies & gentlemen. Here is the first few paragraphs from Motley Fool from tonight @6:30pm (look up entire article, if you choose). ""iPhone 12 Sales Soar in China to Close Out 2020The strong demand is expected to continue through Lunar New Year, which bodes well for Apple investors.Danny VenaDanny Vena(TMFLifeIsGood)Jan 12, 2021 at 6:42PMAuthor BioNews reports suggest that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 family of devices sold far better than expected in China during the fourth quarter, providing further evidence that the long-predicted ""super cycle"" may have arrived. A story from DigiTimes (courtesy of MacRumors) reports that Apple sold north of 18 million iPhones during Q4, a ""staggering"" number which would suggest that Apple took more than 20% market share to close out the year. To put that in perspective, prior to the report, Chinese rivals including Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo accounted for more than 90% of the devices sold in the country, leaving a high-single digit percentage available for Apple and every other provider in the country, making the iPhone makers achievement all the more remarkable."""
"What is a matter w/AAPL & Tim Cook lately? This stock trades flat & declining compared to overall market....I don't trade it, I own but I'm starting to have reservations at the opportunity cost is too great...."
Rumor floating $AAPL wants the name and ticker for their new electric car company. I cant find anything on it but will ride the hype.222k at .0006
"Sold some of my AAPL and going into BB , AYTU."
"After that 4-for-1 split last August I ended with exactly 5,000 shares of Apple. I sure am glad I had the patience to wait out Apple's recent 5 month hibernation. My shares of Apple just made me a little over $20K for my portfolio today. Gotta love the excitement & stomach ulcer of investing!"
Apple will continue cruise to $140 by tomorrow because bullish sentiments are building up by trading volume against the o/I indicators. Do trade cautiously. super long Apple.
"I should’ve bought before the days end, gotta try and hop in quick on Monday, next week looks like it’ll be a monster week."
Don’t want to be overly optimistic but Apple might break $150
Buy apple + hold it 
Days like yesterday this give Apple a chance to buy it's own stock back with their massive free cash flow. dips in the price are great for long term holders.
Looks like a golden buying opportunity as I expect upgrades in the coming days
up or down tomorrow ... just curious what others think
"Apple has reached its all-time high and that's before earnings report Wednesday when it should explode, as I said one month ago get in at 120 now you better get in at 139 because it's going to 150 and upwards shortly, I've been in this stock 12 years so I'm pretty familiar with the cycles and then this cycle says going up !"
Apple will zoom pass $250 soon . Guaranteed!
Wedbush’s Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance:“I believe six to nine months from now we’re looking at a $3 trillion market cap for Apple.”
Bring on the upgrades. Investors need other people to tell them that earnings were great and brand clearly winning in market and expanding on multiple fronts.
I will see you at $150+ after earnings. Merry Christmas
Wow!
170 by summer
Apple will bounce tomorrow ! $145 by noon Bullish!
Love the negative comments from the shorts and trolls! They know what’s coming next week. Today proved it
Are we close to the low point for Apple or will this continue for a few more trading days? Looking to buy some more shares.
$140 LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
don't forget to sell before earnings. expect a 10 points drop in after hours.
Should close over $132 today. It’s just getting warmed up!
Still up above $2.1T market cap. If this goes under $2T that’s a buy. Going to $2.5T after earnings. Very possible like TSLA to add that much value in short time!
Dividend coming
"Bets ar ein, 6 straight days of UP/GREEN, today will be sideways as the bettors wait the results after the bell."
What are they saying about Apple in the Reddit boards?
If this isn’t even a little green the last two days I’m getting g rid of the rest of my Apple. Sold the first half at $131 months ago and we are just about there again...
Tomorrow is another day. Isn’t it comforting to know that on a quarterly basis on average AAPL will always show a profit. AAPL for me has been a stellar performer. AAPL long will always deliver.
"In Two weeks or so, they will dip significantly, that’s the when you buy for effect."
Life is one big circle! Isn;t it?Last Dec 16 AAPL Was $126Dec 29 AAPL was $138.79Jan 15h AAPL dipped to $126+ in after hours.Jan 29th...?
"since I've closed my puts around 133, apple has dropped to 130/131, i've now taking a long position in appl with calls mid feb"
I agree... It is a great company!... The market is just erratic....
"""All good things to those who wait."" - Dr. Hannibal Lector"
The first thing dictators do is silence your opposition by censorship.
All the research companies have increased the target price from the 140s-30s to over $160+++Not sure why this stock is down this morning but i am guessing within a week - this will be around 150 to 160
Apple supplier TSMC is skyrocketing right now on an earnings beat. I called this a few days ago. What implications does this have for Apple? Take one guess. Apple long! Own it don't trade it.
"We'll, I was right to be conservative about Apple's share price movement, however I never expected the market to be in the dumper on the day Apple reported. It's not a big deal to me but I'm sure there are plenty of unhappy new Apple investors out there wondering why Apple stock is down on nearly perfect earnings. I'm guessing it's a market macro thing that just happens to include Apple and nothing directly due to Apple's fault. I've learned to live with this market weirdness and Apple has always risen above it. I have no idea when Apple will start to rise based on earnings, but I know it will eventually. Were Apple's numbers not good enough? I doubt that. Is there profit-taking going on? Maybe. I'm Apple-long so I'm not going to lose sleep over whatever is happening today or tomorrow. All the guessing of how much Apple was going up on earnings didn't quite work out for today. The future is too difficult to predict with any accuracy. I have to admit I didn't think Apple would drop on near perfect earnings, but that's just how things go. I'm not concerned about it and I'm going to happily look forward to tomorrow."
Shares gonna be snapped up today at this price 
Buy AMC and make some real 
Time to sell......The market is going to drop 15-20%. Why buy Apple at $134 when you will be able to buy at <$115 in a few weeks.
Apple -7 points (-5%) for the week but nasdaq - 550 points too (-4%)
Now that Political drama came to rest and Earning coming up with in 3 weeks and with Solid December sales... Also Institutes can buy the shares (After dumping stock for Year end tax plays)... I see only Bullishness.Feel free to disagree with a valid reason.
Let me add if the market was down where would apple be $125.????? Everything is green.
Buy Apple ............ Long & strong = big profit
Apple car  beep beep to $1000 one day
"Apple has today announced that New Year's Day saw a new single-day spending record of over $540 million on the App Store, as the company celebrated a number of highlights from its various services in 2020."
Have to laugh at the selling right before the mother of all ERs! Apple is about to report over 100 billion in sales!
"Impeachment gets voted and done so fast, stimulus takes months! Lol"
"Think ahed people ! Don’t be spooked by the short term recent news! Yeah apples had a couple of down days but the future is bright ! This week record, growing earnings were reported and the future is filled with new technologies and even a Car or 2 Apple stock is going to boom over the coming years so Buy apple, hold Apple and profit from apple!"
"*stock drops* shorts: end of the world, yep, you will never see this price again"
"Am I missing something here this kind of move parabolic before earning. If it continues like this, this could be over 200 by 2.15.2021. I say that to say people are usually cautious before earnings so who is buying this like this??? Don't get me wrong I am long and I am not complaining."
"Today's drop is part of the healthy pullback of the uptrend. Uptrend continues to 200 in Q1. Not every day is green day in stocks. It has to go gradual to be healthy, I will buy more at the opening. I feel Nasdaq100 has beat earnings by majority. I feel correction and short squeeze will come eventually to AAPL. EPS/revenues speak!!! no reason this low with solid earnings. Divergent here. Pop will come. I will accumulate every $1, in the end 150 breakout will come tomorrow or Friday at any given time. You will see"
150 after earning
Downgrades galore tomorrow.The golden child is no longer producing.
"Only six business days until earnings, so maybe Apple wii rise into earnings. I wouldn't go by today because almost all stocks were up and Apple wasn't up as much as some other tech stocks. Not that it matters. Apple will continue to rise. I have no doubts the holiday quarter will be strong but don't look for a Netflix type of share gain because Netflix's market cap is around $300B which is nowhere close to Apple's $2.2T market cap. Apple practically buys back Netflix's market cap in shares every six months. I keep thinking about what sort of acquisitions Apple could be making with all that money being used for buybacks. Apple could own all the American car companies by now. I'm just saying if Apple wants to get into the auto business, money wouldn't be an obstacle. I know it's not that simple but it sounds rather interesting because of the EV craze in the market.Anyway, the next couple of weeks should be exciting if Apple had done really well for the holiday quarter but I'm always wary about Wall Street's expectations of Apple. I'm hoping for decent results and good guidance for the next quarter which investors will appreciate."
GME proves you should never listen to a short seller
So far the 3 days of APPLE CENSORSHIP Cost investors approximately $4.00 a share in profits. How much longer?
"This is not the rise in share price that most everyone was thinking. Biggest blow out in earning per quarter by any company in history. I expect this will trade in a range 138-140 till next week. Options expire tomorrow and that usually means a down day, but who knows in this market, when you least expect it it goes through the roof even on a down day. We could be sitting right back at $145 by eod day but i do not think this runs till next week."
Down a buck and people are panicking? I would get out of the market and buy an index fund or bonds. Good lord get a grip.
Longs don’t be too upset. Last Friday it was at $138 and I was happy. I’m sitting long and happy. Waiting for a few more shares from dividend
"Apple also declared a cash dividend of $0.205 cents per share and said that it had spent over $30 billion on total shareholder return, which includes share buybacks, during the quarter. Apple’s first fiscal quarter is typically its largest of the year and includes critical holiday sales during December."
Steve Grasso in Twitter:Wednesday 1/6/21 first day back on air @CNBCFastMoney looking forward to it! Still own all my favorites names $BFT $STPK $TSE $CPRI $WRK $OLN among others. Bought $AAPL recently still holding.
144.92 +1.76 (1.23%)After hours: 6:51PM EST
Bought the dip 5000 shares in
"just like every Friday for weeks, good looking setups get run over every time."
I think that expectations are very high surrounding this new 5G phone

These Are The 8 Best SPACs To Buy Right Now For more info https://youtu.be/vB5FD8DXnvs
Tesla has gotten way way way ahead of itself with that 1500 PE. Apple on the other hand has always followed its earnings closely throughout its rise.
"Charles Schwab system is down. A day like today and the MF crashes. This has been a problem for sometime, but nothing seems to be working. Anyone else on their platform?"
150's next week for sure
Couple of highlights I took from the call. Luca (CFO) wouldn’t give any guidance BUT he said that March is always the best month for Apple Services. Which also their highest margins. So that bodes well. Also Tim wouldn’t call it by name but it was obviously what he was talking about when he said they are going forward with some very exciting new product. Can you say Apple Car. Any news coming out or Cupertino in the next month or two about Apple Car will have the stock soaring. Cook just needs to utter the word car and the stock will take off. Hehe 
"Can you imagine if Apple comes out and says ""Hey shareholders, we have an electric car project and we are spinning that out to our existing shareholders. Each shareholder gets 1 to 1 share in the new co"". Now that would be spectacular!"
Apple like a stallion being held back! He gonna break loose when earnings announced
"150$ before or right after earnings, thank god i got in @ 128$"
CNBC is coming unglued because a APPL is down 4%. Who cares? they act like apple cured cancer or something. nobody getting hurt here up 62% in the last year.
buy here before we go over 150
All the US market futures are up. The Nikkei & FTSE are up. Looks like it'll be a good market day for the longs today. Shorties better go cover before you get your margin call...!
I counted 8 upgrades yesterday with an average stock price of $160.
I am long. Thanks for your 10 years work.
145.00 after hours again.Tomorrow will be interesting.
Whoever is selling right now at this point is.. not very smart lol. So much momentum building and one of the biggest quarters ever is about to be unveiled IMO..
Apple Car Coming Soon!!
As investors in AAPL we can agree to disagree with civility. However there are those on this board that strive for the opposite with negativity and disrespect. Keep politics out and contribute to a fruitful dialogue pertaining to the purpose of this page.
"TSLA reporting the same day AAPL, tsla fan boys may get a wake up call on what real earnings look like."
"See, this is why they teach you in MBA school to ALWAYS make a diversified investment portfolio. Yesterday my Amazon shares was sleeping, so my Apple & Tesla shares shouldered the burden of carrying the portfolio. Today my Apple shares sleeps and my Amazon & Tesla carries the burden. Those 3 stocks are the anchors of my portfolio. All of the other stocks within the portfolio are the supporting players..."
Imagine selling lmaoo
Great to give asylum to people but first focus on the elderly and the disabled and increase S.S. Payments
I have 574 shares of appl at 108. I planOn buying onThe dip tomorrow Thank you.
Wow Goldman sach was quick to give MSFT and hot upgrade BEFORE earnings mind you solid beat all around for the company round of applause  Now Goldman has been awfully quite about apple and no upgrades after record quarter 
WEBUSH: THIS IS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. AAPL WILL BOUNCE BACK OVER 141 TOMORROW.
I am already making money. Bought at 15 minutes prior to market close... took a cut off massive gains with GME/AMC and purchased GOLD/AAPL.... I am already up afterhours.. .TY... APPLE BOOM
"As soon as AAPL call interest disappears, helped by today’s action, obviating need to manipulate its price, AAPL trends higher as usual ... institutions win both ways"
Watch for money rotation today from AMC and GME into AAPLAAPL is sound and positive today vs cosmic speculation games...
"With Big Tech Companies Earning Reports coming this week, shorts took the profit and moved there but less they know that $BNGO $NNDM are consolidating and will soar  soon.Also there’s a lot of hype around $GME $AMC which ain’t good for people who tryna enter today or tomorrow. All the Millionaires and Billionaires gonna take up profits soon and will leave them all Better y’all stay in a reliable stock like NNDM BNGO cz they be the next $50 and then $100 soon Don’t forget that $NNDM $BNGO is among top CATHIE WOOD listing for the year 2021 along $TSLA $WKHS $BLNK $NIO $AAPL etc"
"The ""PARTY"" starts in a few minutes.......I hope this stock hits 160+++++"
"The coming massive tax increases on corporations individuals and investors is not good for Apple. They can be the greatest company in the world, and perhaps they are, but when the government starts siphoning off so much of your money it’s a strong headwind."
"I had heard a report on the radio how Apple will likely be the top growth tech stock for a large company in 2021. Apple should lead all the FANG stocks in 2021 as it did this year. The report also mentioned that Amazon's growth will likely slow in 2021. Amazon's cloud service growth is likely to suffer from more competition from Microsoft, Google, Oracle, etc. The cloud service space is finally getting rather crowded sooner than expected. Apple is supposed to remain strong thanks to an iPhone supercycle and a resurgence of Mac sales using Apple Silicon. Bundled Services revenue will continue to grow along with more active devices (a billion+) and a strong customer base. All of Apple's products are in high demand despite the pandemic. Many analysts thought Apple would be hit the hardest during the pandemic but they were wrong, very wrong. Anyway, Apple is supposed to stay strong at least for a couple of quarters in 2021 so that's good for shareholders. It doesn't seem like there will be any major pullbacks for Apple stock in early 2021. We'll see if that strength holds up."
Investors as well as analysts love Apple.
Cannot stop this((((( $165 by)))))) Wednesday. These momentum will continue for entire year until it make $200. I am Long and not selling. still a good buy .. Some one bought 100contract of Apple Option of 2022 that is a very strong sign. Good Buying opportunity
after market drop makes no sense. The wall street guys are playing with normal investors
What does the next split look like and when?7:1? 2028?5:1? 2026? 3:1? 2023?
"Like someone said earlier Apple  will probably get some investors moving over from IBM, intel and Tesla. Hey maybe even Bitcoin?"
