Got to admit.. I miss $140+. Not sure what it’s going to take to send this higher. Last earnings were absolutely incredible and we drop $20 a share. Little nervous at least short term.

What company is a better company? PE is in 30's? Tesla is 1400. Appl is making more money than any company over 1 billion a day 7 days a week 365 days year. I'm not saying we should be 200$ but we will be heading higher shortly. It's a matter of time before we head higher and everyone starts to load up again. Good luck to all.
Never lose confidence in APPL. Looking forward to continued growth. This downturn is just a blip before we head back up again.
"“Inflationary pressures will develop very quickly. I don’t think there’s any shelter here.”Moody’s Analytics Mark Zandi believes Wall Street is significantly underestimating the seriousness of an inflation comeback, and he warns it will affect every corner of the market — from big tech to cyclical trades.“These are broad, macroeconomic forces that are going to affect all parts of the market equally. It’s going to be a very difficult market to navigate in, and I don’t know that there’s one part of the market that is going to do meaningfully better than the other.”Investors will have to get accustomed to wild market swings that last longer than two weeks.

"my god, all this complaining! This is a fantastic entry level. Just buy and hold"
This happens all the time. Apple goes down after earnings and then whipsaws back up to record highs. The company is firing on all cylinders. Long term investors have never. ever. been disappointed by Apple. Take a gander at the chart back through time. Apple has never been better poised for profitability than it is right now.
Will bagholders get burnt today stay tuned.
"Right now, fully 2/3s of the country is thinking, “this guy is seriously the president?”"

"With $GME mania out of the way, I believe more retail investors will be turning to safer stocks like $AAPL today. With price of $120 apple is more of value stock and growth stock at the same time with strongest balance-sheet in the world."
Stimulus Fever is Sweeping the Nation. Shoppers are lining up like Black Friday. Retailers registers will be ringing coast to coast!
"With the specter of inflation looming, Berkshire is plowing cash into the safest asset it knows...itself, which is 40% Apple. As I said last week, Apple will do the same."
"Both Berkshire Hathaway and ARK Invest have trimmed AAPL shares, may be its growth is stalling?"
"AAPL over $140 makes everyone happy. By August with students returning to schools and colleges, expect additional demand for AAPL goods and services."

"Analysts' up price targets seeing Apple at the forefront of digital transformation..

Price target of $200.Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty maintains an Outperform rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and raises the price target from $152 to $164 after yesterday's FQ1 report.Huberty notes that the active device installed base (10% from 7% in last year's period) and customer loyalty is still above 90%.The broad-based revenue recovery in Greater China points to sustained higher engagement and market share gains, says Huberty.Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar (Overweight, $135 to $160) highlights the double-digit sales growth for all categories with the 17% Y/Y iPhone revenue boost indicating strong iPhone 12 demand. On the call, management mentioned that supplies remain tight for the iPhone Pro and Pro Max.Kumar notes that FQ1 gross margin came in well above expectations on the higher revenue and improved product mix, and Apple's margin forecast was largely flat for the current quarter.Evercore (Outperform, $160 to $163) says ""there is no need for Reddit mentions with a performance like this.""Analyst Amit Daryanani calls gross margins the ""sleeper upside.""The analyst thinks the lack of guidance for iPhone and Mac sales suggests material acceleration in those markets, offset by modest decelerations for Services and Wearables.Apple shares are down 2.4% pre-market to $138.64 in what is proving to be a notably volatile week for the Street.On the earnings call, Apple management said current quarter growth should accelerate on the year and follow typical seasonality on the quarter.

"Why would are people trying to sell at this stage, with the stimulus about to pass people will have money to buy iPhones and buy apple stock."
Just relax and watch Netflix or Apple TV. I love reading some panic sellers )))
being this is a poplar stock. I'd like to ask if what's going on in the market is normal and about how long it takes to get back up 10-20...being it only took 2-3weeks to drop. I'm a new investor since Dec 2020 I've lost 15k profit and 10k principalnever invested in apple
Very unusual trading pattern. I never noticed AAPL stock at a steady price for so long.
apple has become a stock for retirees. it is lazy and doesn't want to do anything each day. watching paint dry .
"Dear, Apple stock holders. Instead of watching AAPL ( Bullish or Bearish ). Why don’t you promote their business at your personal social media platforms. Isn’t Apple stocks are your business?"
I can't believe Nasdaq is down .8% and this is down 2%Am I the only who thinks apple products are going to be purchased with stimulus money?

"Fed Holds Steady on Interest Rates, Bond PurchasesPaul Kiernan•Last Updated March 17, 2021, 2:02 PMWASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve kept its easy-money policies in place and vowed to maintain them until the U.S. economy recovers further from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, while also highlighting the brightening outlook for growth."
"Hmmm saw Cathie Woods sold AAPL, anyone know how many shares ? Thanks"
I’m thinking if Buffett and Ark also apple has to buy back sharers this can pass $150 if it goes on a run
The most innovative company on the planet. Interest rates near 0 and Major announcements on the way. Here we sit 20% off our high

Will open at 126+
Pretty soon there will be downgrades as stocks are valued too high
Desperately need a green week :/ we should really be at least $140 :/
AAPL is overdue for a $3 to $5 up day from these levels. Have not seen this much red in AAPL in a long time especially after the best earnings and revenues EVER!!!
"WS lie about rising rates hurting tech. A company’s value is the sum of its after tax discounted cash flows. If one raises the discount rate it impacts equally the discounted cash flows of all companies. Rising rates does lower cash flows for companies with debt since interest expense increases. Therefore, a company like AAPL with no net debt is not impacted at all and to the extent competitors’s interest expense increases, AAPL wins!"
"Apple has been down consistently since Valentine’s Day, but this is a clear indication that a rally is happening. Everyone get on board and let’s continue bidding Apple back up to the yearly high."
I know why it fell down like this.I bought APPL first time in my investing career so that it fell down from the exact same day and still falling down. It will go up right after I sell. Anyone wants me to sell?
The only reason people are snapping up bonds is that they expect the yield to drop to near zero very soon and they can make a profit selling their bonds they got now. Only thing is why would anyone buy your high yield bonds after the interest rates had dropped to zero unless you are prepared to split the difference. Any idea of profit is riskier than a Alabama roadkill pie
So much speculation on date of Apples spring event.we should see invites released either this tuesday or next tuesday.the q2 report date should be april 29 and dividend increase on april 30th.dividend increase had normally been 10% except last year when it was reduced to 6.i strongly believe it will be 14% this year.which would be .24 cents per quarter.my opinion only.
Buy buy buy
Hopefully this is a signal that the rotation into the recovery stocks is nearing an end.
Last week 10 year Treasury 1.6% today 1.73 %....you think it’s a good thing? 30 yr 2.5 %. The last big run up this year will be into the April earnings! Then you ready for a major correction! Treasuries up! Inflation up! Taxes up! A Covid economy that will not return to normal for New York or California and many other states. You think the market goes straight up? You think Robinhood kids will set the market a blaze and rocket to Dow 40 k? Hmmm reality will set in! The easy money will end! The economy will be lucky to grow 2.5% in second quarter 2021! The bigs will roll back into consumer staple stocks with dividends. Soon the BBQ will begin when Senile Puppet President with Alzheimer’s ups the taxes on corporations and all lines of income! Especially stock market gains And dividends will be taxed at historic levels. Don’t believe it? Watch and see !

VLAD vs.POTUS. VLAD said let's have a debate. Let the games begin. No teleprompters allowed.

"The point is we were in terrible pain last whole week and saw a glimpse of hope today. Not that we wanted to sell at 125 or so. On a day like today when NASDAQ was green and a good 8 hour of stable market, this type of last minute action requires regulators intervention. This is not fair for all of us. This big guys have been playing unfairly for years. That needs to stop. I pray and hope some positive actions in the horizon for today’s manipulation"

All you Apple investors were all hootin' and hollerin' two months ago when Apple was 143/per share. You all were saying it was the greatest stock and that you owned it 10 years and has been great to you.Now look at Apple. Not so great now. Stocks will turn against you at some point.
"3/8/21 : ""All the money is going out of tech.""3/9/21 : ""All the money is going into tech.""."
Those selling for a few pennies now really does not understand Apple and their future. Sit still and let it go. You will reap higher profits. I originally put $ 3400 on Apple in 1976. Made a lot without getting in and out all the time. A lot less stressful.
"Nice day, but I am still far from my all time high. I need $AAPL, $CRWD and $SPCE to rebound more."
I remember when Apple traded sideways for over a year. The dividend was the only benefit. $175 price target is based off 2024 potential. Let's hope this doesn't repeat but agree there are far more cyclical stocks that will produce greater returns for 2021.
apple price target raised 175.
 Is a very nice color for Apple !
Big week ahead major indicators will see a big jump. Apple $142 or higher
"Yeah 6 mos right back were we started, Roku and Zm Tsla etc go up and down 30 points a day guess how much that's worth with options?"

Apple long term support trendline broken ~~~> AAPL $135.00 broken ( that was the MAJOR RED FLAG )The final support is $108.00This $108.00 support will keep apple alive temporary ... once $108.00 support crack .... GAME OVER
"""Buy when there's blood in the streets.""."
borrowing shares to sell shares and buy back later (shorting) is the opposite of borrowing cash to buy shares and sell later.
as noted..... 130+ today....135-140 by end of the week....time to buy is now
"Disastrous February for Apple, I hope with March comes renewed positive growth and the LONG wait was well worth it. Cheers to spring and AAPL."
RELAX...THERE WAS A HEADFAKE LAST SUMMER AND THEN AAPL ZOOMED HIGHER. AAPL WILL BE IN MID-140s BY SUMMER.
"If we can cross back over $130 (the 50 day moving average) then, the stock can run."
Bought 1000 shares at $119
I would rather be long FAANG than any leisure/reopen stocks from here.
Just don't trade it. Buy on dips and keep averaging in. Not worth the stress when you know AAPL will be much higher in the future.
"Everyone, shut up the stock will come back. I have my life savings in this company and get angry about the past performance as well. It's the market, too many other distractions, Tesla boom, Bitcoin and all the get rich quick schemes. They will pass and when they do Apple will be the eye of their eye. It will. Stick with basics, good earning, plenty of money and great products year after year. It all comes down to that."
"From the buffet letter - Berkshire’s investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases. We began buying Apple stock late in 2016 and by early July 2018, owned slightly more than one billion Apple shares (split-adjusted). Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple.Our cost for that stake was $36 billion. Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.Despite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding.6But that’s far from all of the good news. Because we also repurchased Berkshire shares during the 21⁄2 years, you now indirectly own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than you did in July 2018.This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future. Apple has publicly stated an intention to repurchase its shares as well. As these reductions occur, Berkshire shareholders will not only own a greater interest in our insurance group and in BNSF and BHE, but will also find their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well."

So now all who panicked and sold will have to pay the govt 35% of any gains. Market timers always disregard this and that’s why they always underperform by a wide margin
Zero growth. Nearly flat earnings. This is no GOOGL or AMZN. It deserves a 10 multiple.
This is a definite buying opportunity
It is very easy for APPL to drop 2 to 3% for any reason. I don't know what happened to the fundamentals. Looks like they don't matter at all these days
Not only are there open now - now moving into target stores- 17 stores to start

"Warren Buffett Says Berkshire's Apple Investment Shows The 'Power Of Repurchases' 03/01/21 11:11 AM March 1, 2021 02:28 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long IdeasBerkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett over the weekend wrote his annual letter to shareholders and highlighted the “power of repurchases” using Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an example.What Happened: Buffett said that Berkshire began buying shares of the iPhone maker in late 2016 and by early June 2018 owned more than one billion shares (adjusted for splits). “Saying that, I’m referencing the investment held in Berkshire’s general account and am excluding a very small and separately-managed holding of Apple shares that was subsequently sold. When we finished our purchases in mid-2018, Berkshire’s general account owned 5.2% of Apple,” wrote the veteran investor.The cost for acquiring that stake was $36 billion and since then Berkshire has enjoyed regular dividends averaging about $775 million annually and has pocketed an extra $11 billion in 2020 by selling a small part of its holdings. The continuous repurchase of shares by Apple and the consequent shrinking number of shares outstanding has meant that Berkshire now owns 5.4% of the Tim Cook-led company. “That increase was costless to us,” wrote Buffett.Why It Matters: Berkshire’s third-quarter operating profits declined 32% to $5.48 billion from $8.07 billion a year ago. The company repurchased $9.3 billion worth of stock in the period. Since Berkshire also repurchased its own shares during the past two and a half years, its shareholders now own a full 10% more of Apple’s assets and future earnings than they did in July 2018, wrote Buffett.“This agreeable dynamic continues. Berkshire has repurchased more shares since yearend and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,” revealed the Oracle of Omaha.Buffett also pointed to Apple’s publicly stated intention to repurchase shares and thus Berkshire shareholders would find “their indirect ownership of Apple increasing as well.”"
"FlGT dropped $10m, FVRR dropped $20, Tasla dropped so much that it is at 677 now; LSPd dropped from considerably. SO what if AAPL dropped a few dolalrs?"

Yeh what a buying opportunity. Game is rigged
"Every coin has two sides. While the Da Vinci Strategy put a 15% tax deferred cash dividend in your pockets it has put pressure on the stock price upward momentum. Watch the open interest everyday to see if investors are closing or selling.If you sold a Jan 22 covered call at the time you bought the stock is the recap:Jan 22... Dec 28.... Feb 19.... Change $135.... $21.70.... $15.40.... $6.20$140.... $19.51,,,,, $13.70,,,, $5.80$145.... $17.45.... $12.05,,,, $5.40$150,,,, $15.70,,,, $10.60,,,, $5.10Stock hit $138.19 then closed at $136 on Dec 29th then ran to $145, so these calls were much higher when they were sold. I watch thee everyday. Until recently, the Jan 22 call had a 15% premium to market pirce. Now that is 13% But also the price change was too.IF Da Vinci Strategy was used when stock was bought, the price change was offset mostly by the profit on sale of the calls.For example: When the stock was $145 the Jan 22 $145 calls sold for $22. So the Investor who sold these is hedged down to $145 - A$22 = $123. AAPL has bounced off of $136 to $128 five times"
Wow super impressed. Another red day
"Cook discussing how Apple is a good corporate citizen. Covid, Bay Area housing, scholarships, educational opportunities for under served communities."
"I really don't understand you guys, if you are all long term investors and you are not woried why apple is tanking last 7 months, why you chearleading here all day. Why you just don't forget about it and come here in 10 years."
$60 bill worth of Apple stock was dumped in final 14 mins of the trading day. Not a great sign for the market.
Buffett and Gates are still AAPL longs. They didn’t sell their entire positions. Taking profit from a stock that was up 80% in the prior year is a smart strategy to offset losses in other sectors.
"Apple has been the easiest trade...buy around 118-120 range, sell at 125 or so...buy and repeat...so predictable...institutions are day trading like that...why wait 5 yrs to make money?"

Back to 125 today

"Up and down, up and down. Stays up for a while, then goes back down. What is it going to take to get it up, and keep it up?"
"You know the large fund managers are watching this one closely trying to establish where the bottom will be. They see this as an easy, almost no risk 25% run to make their next quarter once the bottom is made but all are waiting for someone to go big with that first buy signal. This is like watching the Duke brothers trade orange futures."

"I'll let these trendy portfolio managers add to industrials and walmart - I'm doubling positions in APPL, QCOM and Broadcom. The notion that 'value' is due has been coming forever and even with this rate 'increase', the ten year is still below it's levels a year ago. Tech will lead the world forward, data is the new oil and chips are the key to data processing. Easiest buy decisions I can remember."
"Interesting.News how Warren and Vanguard trimmed a few shares and AAPL falls past 50 DMA and upward tend indicator.Now it is down $2+ in pre-market.WE may see $127 as per ""historical prices""."
"AAPL is about to have a ruthless revenge rally, let this be a lesson to those who panic sold, if nothing fundamental changed about the underlying, then there is simply no reason to sell."
"If it aint worth the value it aint worth it. Every time it looks like it may break upwards the shorts whack the move. I am afraid Apple is a thing of the past. Google has better smart phones, Samsung definitely has nice smart phones. Google HAS a car, Apple barely talking about it. Pads aplenty in the market. Apple in decline"
I think July 4th will be “Masks Off” day. 85% of the population will have been vaccinated or already had Covid by then. The economy will come roaring back. Invest for this.

Looks like apple is peaked at 122..bull runs can't lift it
Finally started a position after 20 years of debate. I’m doing it with a big smile on my face because I know what is and will be in 20 years when I’ll be closing in on retirement.
The iPhone isn’t enough obviously. Apple needs to go waaaaaay hard into the cloud service business ala Amazon. Phones laptops and watches won’t be enough growth going forward
Apple is one of the best companies in the world and you have the chance to buy it now at a huge discount.AAPL was way oversold and the big boys are realizing it's time to jump back in as we head to $150 in the coming weeks!
"Trading Apple long there is a reasonable to middling chance you won't lose everything (as long as you buy the stocks). The trading opportunities do exist right now but timing is everything, and nobody can guarantee they will have liquidity at the right time. Long term investors will most likely sit this period out or buy more for the future (I would imagine)"
Management is tired . Time to search for the next Steve Jobs!!
Very Bearish outlook ahead. Looks like big boys' Selling continues.
Just because AAPL got punished for delivering a huge beat on earnings doesn’t mean that it should have ?Buy any weakness because this could rocket up over 160 in one hell of a hurry.

History teaches us how little people learn from experience. The last year was a global economic disaster yet people dipped into their pockets to purchase Apple products. Think about that. When fear gripped the entire world people opened their wallets and handed Apple their BEST quarter ever. Apple is truly an amazing enterprise .
"From zerohedge:Last year, Apple projected it would need components for around 100 million iPhones for the first half of 2021. Now the tech giant is slashing planned production for all iPhones, according to a new report.Nikkei reports industry sources have said Apple requested suppliers to downshift production by 20% compared to its December plan. The majority of the production cuts come from the iPhone 12 mini, the cheapest 5G-enabled phone in its lineup. ========================Sell.Don't worry about $120 or $121, etc.Just sell.Today."
Looks like this is going to $115 and maybe even $110 EOW the way this has fallen. This week could be the end of the correction that’s been happening the last two weeks. If you have a high cost average this could be your chance to average down.
200 by end of 2022.
Germany is green expecting a $124 open today
"after careful due diligence analysis, I am reducing my year end price target from 201.45 to 132.76 . apple is doing nothing wrong. the market conditions have changed. good luck on your investments."

Evercore raises Apple $12 to $175...monster analysis btw...says Apple is a Consumer Staple(yes indeed!)
where do you want your money if inflation rises? In tech stocks that pay little or no dividends or value stocks that pay 4% or better dividends? Investors are going with dividend stocks right now. sorry if the truth hurts
AAPL is trading below the 50-day SMA (simple moving average) of $131.98. There should be some upside price movement here soon to get back to the 50-day SMA and above in my opinion. This seems like just a good buying opportunity to me.
"Now I worry the market may start tanking crazily again....bond rate is soaring before speech...Fed please buy more bond, please...."
Chip shortage. Apple will be a huge player in this space. AMD as well. Both had their personal greatest quarters recently. Both down $20+ since their earnings reports. So fundamentals matter?
there should be a powerful rally on Wall Street due to the stimulus checks that will take all good stocks up
A good PE for Aapl is around 25. It's been in the 30's since last summer.
"time to shut down the computer and prey apple is around in 6 months, because the selling pressure is very high,, but also whats weird is the call options are heavily bought today"
Biggest problem is people chasing trends and not investments in the market right now. Quick cash instead of long term.
"Y MT Newswires— 12:31 PM ET 03/10/202112:31 PM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Apple ( AAPL ) was added by Wedbush Securities to its Best Ideas List as the firm said the recent selloff of the iPhone maker's shares represents an ideal entry point for buying Apple ( AAPL ) stocks."
"Another article in Barron’s dated March 13, 2021 by Ed Lin “one bank made big bets on Apple, Tesla, NIO, and other EV stocks. And that was Norway central bank home of the world largest sovereign wealth fund”. So Denmark pension fund bought Big investments in Apple last month or so and now it is Norway. Also Warren Buffett is buying more Apple as recent as last week"
BEYOND INSANE THE #$%$ MANIPULATION. DOWN 5 DOLLARS IN LAST 2 SEC. SEC SLEEPING ON THE JOB.WHOEVER SOLD THEY WILL GET REAMED FROM BEHIND BIG TIME ON MONDAY. AAPL WILL BE UP 8 TO 9 ON MONDAY
"Metaphor not intended, APPLE will awaken this week and will really bloom in spring and continue to reward investors that are looking to invest in a strong company that long term most assuredly will not disappoint."
Inflation worries are just worries created by those who are pushing for higher interest rates. So they can make more money.
Even Warren used the Van Gough Strategy in 2008 by selling puts on the S$P.When anything sells off to to 20% rather than buy the stock sell the Jan 22 puts for 10%; you either pocket the cash or must buy the stock at another 10% discount to the present market price.
Don’t anyone panic! Later today we come back
"The nice thing about Apple is whenever it goes down, it has a 100% track record of making a new high after."
"herd is why HF are the cause of this mess. The repo market is vital to the functioning of modern finance. Trillions of dollars of short-term loans, known as ""repos,"" are traded each day. hedge funds are borrowing Treasuries in the repo market, selling them and agreeing to buy them back, ideally at a lower price so they can pocket the difference."
Amazing that FB with a slightly better PE is climbing higher while Apple keeps falling.

Bought the Apple dip! Thanks Warren Buffet!
Nasdaq up another 100 points too. Told you.
"Bloomberg: Buffett Singles Out Apple Among Top Three Valuable HoldingsBy Katherine Chiglinsky , February 27, 2021, 12:38 PM EST￼Source: AppleBerkshire Hathaway Inc.’s holding in Apple Inc. has become so valuable that Warren Buffett eyes it on an equal footing to the sprawling railroad business he spent a decade building.Buffett has amassed $120 billion worth of Apple stock since his conglomerate started purchases in late 2016, while only spending $31.1 billion building that stake. That places it among his top three most valuable assets, alongside his insurers and BNSF, the American railroad purchase he completed in 2010, he said in his annual letter on Saturday."
Strange market is green but Apple is still in red.
"bought at 118.56, now 76% holdings in apple. 118.30 was the short term bottom."
Buying back a ton of shares this Q. Great for eps.
Anyone else think that the stimulus will lift the market up tomorrow (along with AAPL)?
"Remember last week when the analysts said there’s no reason to be bearish? And then the market had a heavy sell off. Now this week they’re saying there’s going to be a major sell off? Yea, watch the market be up 2% this week. Gonna jump in this before it’s back to $130 by weeks end."

"Sorry for all who sold at the very bottom. Don’t trade Apple, don’t try to time the market. Justbuy Apple and hold for long term. Tested and verified in person since 2008. I have to admit I sold few times and also that each time I was horrible sorry! Heads up, we own a part of the best company ever. Live long Apple!"
Apple’s valuation suggests buy and hold.
Let’s Go!!!
What going on with apple . Stelar earning good outlook and stock goes down?

Why is FB up almost $12?
Apple is at a 20% down from its all time high. This is buytime. Money will rotate back in very soon because of it.
Apple is clearly a winner
Looks like we are heading to at least $115-$118 range today.

"people think a $2 trillion company, with continous revenue growth valued at $121/share and 33 PE ratio is overvalued, if anything this stock is extremely undervalued and resilient in contrast to the other stocks during the tech correction. this will be $200 sooner or later, don't miss the boat."
"90s dot-com bubble is here again...1. Shiller P/E multiples are highest in two decades.2. The VIX averaged 30 last year vs 25 at the height of dot-com bubble. Peak this year of 37 eclipsed high of 33 in 2000.3. S&P market-cap concentration at all-time high makes index-tracking funds vulnerable to swings in just a few companies.4. Bullish stampede of IPOS like dotcom era. In 2020 there were 538 IPOs, including 248 SPACs, themselves a frothy indicator5. Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation metric: simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product. ""If the ratio approaches 200% as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000 you are playing with fire,"" said Buffett.6. 90% of options buyers lose money. Put/call ratio is seen as a contrarian indicator. Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4 vs 0.39 in March 2000 at the peak of internet stock buying mania.7. Margin debt balances are hitting all-time high of $778 billion 37x the $21 billion in March 2000. Also margin debt to cash in customer accounts is now 72% more debt than cash vs 79% in 2000."

"Yesterday morning on the bell I sold half of my aapl shares after 9 years. I'm sorry whoever invest in this 6 months ago today is going in red. If you invested in Tesla on the same time you would be already doubled your money. We are now in a new decade and investors will find something new to invest. Apple is done. This stock was great from 2010 to 2020.This is not volatility, this is bleeding slowly, on green market days 1% down, on red market days 2% down."
It wants to go green... just happy to see no downturn with fed speaking
9 million shares have been dumped. Nkt sure if this is shorting or people taking their profits and leaving. Either way it doesn't look good...

"Is Apple currently over valued? The professional financial analysts that cover this stock currently have consensus earnings per share estimates for 2021 and 2022 of $4.45 and $4.68, respectively. Apple has historically had significant year-over-year earnings growth, but this is NOT the case for next year. The $4.68 EPS estimate for 2022 is only 5.2% higher than the 2021 estimate of $4.45. Based upon earnings per share perspective, seems like Apple should only be trading with a P/E multiple of 15 to 20 times. That would put the stock value at only between $70 to $94 using next year's EPS estimate of $4.68. I want to buy more shares, but will have to wait until the next market correction to buy them at below $100."
"I guess the ""Algorithim players"" were playing ""rope a dope"" for tomorrow's action.I never saw this coming. Sorry"

He believes stimulus will have a very positive affect on the economy and the market. He used the words “epic bounce back “ to describe 2021.

Apple, Amazon, Microsoft are overvalued? How can a company that prints 32 Billion dollars PER QUARTER be overvalued with a P.E. in the 30's?? It is nonsense that AAPL is down almost 18% from pre earnings price. Tell your friends, your relatives, your mother, your grandmother, anyone you care for to BUY AAPL NOW. 1 year from now, You will not be disappointed you had."

the market magically floats back up. so just learn to buy when it goes down. nothing to do with earnings.
Never bet against apple. I do exactly what financial experts say not to do and invest in one stock and one stock only. That stock is Apple. Being young and foolish with money several times if I kept my Initial $50k investment in Apple in 2010 I would be a millionaire easily with buying 5000 shares at that time which today would be worth over $600k alone not including dividends and reinvestments which would total well over a million at this point. Just looking at the chart it seems Apple goes through these phases of sell offs in Feb and even through March to April before it picks up in the summer and then again early fall and end of winter. I lost about $25k in the last two weeks and today was another rough day. But hold and do well. Sell and maybe you will save some further losses in short but long term you will always lose. 68% chance of apple going up over next 21 trading days based on trefis data.
"Cathie Wood says genomic stocks will be worth more than FAANG. buy now.she likes CRSP, TSLA, bitcoin!"
164 million shares changed hands today. Wow
apple will be up 4 points on Wednesday in a 200 points Nasdaq composite rally.
Buy the dips and own Companies that look to the Future !
I say Apple ends much higher today. Lots of buyin going on in the tech sector specially beloved Apple. Thanko
Stuck in the $121 range. waiting for a good rally at this point.
Apple is so oversold and so undervalued...right now trading at a net cash forward PE of 20....Apple the greatest brand name in history with a 100b and growing FCF is trading at a next year forward PE of 20....unbelievable
Someone with cash and confidence could have made some money today!I only had one of the two.
I think it’s time for a rebound!
Bloomberg says Apple most likely to use Foxconn and Magna to build Apple Car.....absolutely perfect solution
The market will always fluctuate but the value of AAPL as a profitable company will always remain the same. That is why you purchased the stock and why you should hold onto this stock. AAPL has done this before and has always recovered.
People just don't want Apple stock. Until they do the sellers will remain in control
BUY AAPL before millennials buy with stimulus check this week. HEDGIES are nervous. SHORT SQUEEZEIS COMING. MILENIALS BUYING AS SOON AS THEIR CHECK ARRIVES...buy now with margin and hold it long term
closing price at 123.76 today. Nasdaq composite index can fall 500 points on Wednesday with fed reserve meeting.
was today like a dead cat bounce?
Apple is getting closer to be worth holding again.... it was a nasty day to most stocks!
if this is a bear market expect Apple to be cut down to half maybe 80 the you'll have to come up to three or four percent

"Intra day AAPL has had a 18% correction in a few weeks.Enough is enough!People are getting hurt,"
Why is AAPL down so much? Everything I’m reading online says the company is doing great and so on. But why the drop?
"yep, the key is to keep buying and never sell. Shorties are playing with fire by now, AAPL 200 breakout i coming. Buy and hold . Hedgies have a limit time. This money is from big 401K retirements customers on AAPL already placed. This drop is fake,,,buy"
We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money. Check for yourself: $NDAQ at all time highs today whereas $IXIC slumps. IF this game ain't rigged to the core I don't know anymore. ALGOS + NDAQ Exchange collusion? You bet... $baba $tsla $aapl $momo $msft $dji $pltr $fb $goog $jd $nflxSEC please step it and go after the algo traders and exchanges. The fish always starts smelling bad at the head.

"Let's clear up any confusion about Da Vinci Strategy. It was NOT a suggestion to short or sell.Why would WE suggest to buy any stock then suggest a strategy to hurt it's value?Da Vinci is a strategy of time. Often long term calls have a crazy premium. So my 12 years of observation concluded why not sell a covered call then allow the stock grow into that valuation.Years past when AAPL ran past the ""giveaway"" price which it the sold strike price + premium; it worked out. WE ""leaped up"" WE took the paper loss but sold the next year's covered call for more tax deferred cash. AAPL being AAPL it eventually dipped 20% then we closed out that sale."
problem with premarket is we don't know what volume is driving the higher prices
Apple over $122 we are HAPPY look @ ACRX climb up 10%...$FB green too up 3%%%
"Ok, it held up. 575 Dow didn’t hurt. Still doesn’t feel right. It backed down from up $1.65 to $1.05 in the final seconds to close up $1.29. It’s a bad pattern. Been 7 months. Where and when it breaks up this BS is the question. It wasn’t like this over the past 5-6 years."
Big mistake so far selling my ROKU and Pinterest to get more shares of APPLE. Oh well.. good luck everyone

"analyst upgrade, downgrade, hype articles- nothing can prop up aapl shares. Funds accumulated billions of shares and a 1% reduction of 170 mil shares is worth 2 days havoc on prices. This will continue until Apple work toward buyback and reduce the count. I dont think split was a good idea. Apple shares are too many and too readily available which is why its stuck and keeps going down even on green days. sad but true..."
I live in Silicon Valley and know a guy who works at Apple as a marketing director. I asked him what’s up and he told me big things are coming. I tried to press him for more details and he zipped his lips real quick. What he calls big things and what investors call big things might be different. Time will tell
The big money seems to be able to control everything when it comes to calls and puts and they seem like a waste of time unless you are the big money

Corrections(10%-19.9%) happen every year in a half since 1900. We were due after such a run up. I hope many took advantage and bought in or more. I did :)
"Honest to God feel sorry for people who sold last week. You know we live in the biggest and best economy and market in the world, that the economy is opening up, that more people are going back to work, stimulus is on its way and that close to 90% companies met or beat a three years’ average expectations with overwhelmingly beating expectations and you know investing in the stock market will make you between reasonable to very rich (ask Warren Buffett he has given an average of 23.3% return to his investors since 1959) and you want to sell ? Don’t do it. Go long. Stay long. Thank you"
Enough is enough!People are getting hurt. AAPL has fallen to its' previous $116 yesterday.20% off of its' intra day high of $145 and $10 off of Dec 31 close of $131.I noticed a huge pension fund bought in at this discount the other day. More will follow
"As you can see, Apple is back to $120 as I expected and it won't go much lower. This is not a bad thing so don't be upset. This is part of Apple's strategy. Apple is happily buying up shares each time the sissies get scared of one thing or another and start dumping their stock. I really enjoy seeing these opportunities for the small retail investor who appreciates investing into a solid company. I want to see all those outstanding shares slowly disappearing over the coming months. Warren Buffett likes this type of financial strategy. None of that flaky Bitcoin stuff for the old school Buffet and Munger. I see that it works even though I would prefer higher dividends from Apple. Apple is doing fine and selling plenty of work-from-home products so any share price drop is not due to Apple not selling products. Loyal shareholders will be rewarded YoY despite having to witness days like this. Apple has this market nonsense covered. Ignore the market noise and buy even a few shares of Apple if you have the patience to wait until the end of the year to see decent, if not huge, returns. Apple has TSMC on its side and has full capacity for processors, so there should be less shortages for Apple. The Apple Stores in NYC have steady foot traffic, so that's a good indicator of ongoing sales. Don't be scared. Apple isn't going away. Today is just another buying opportunity for the smart investor of any solid company. Sissies, beware."

"Yep, I am buying AAPL with all my margin power tomorrow . Time to squeeze shorties . Q4 was huge and still under this price???come on!!. Shorties will pay the price for playing with the price tomorrow. Any dip during intraday I am buying more and holding. AAPL 200 is coming , I know that 2021 is a bullish year. Especially Stimulus 3 is coming, it will boost revenues higher than before $3,600 per child, that's a lot to buy on apple products"
People selling AAPL at these levels are on crack lol. I never thought I would get a another buying opportunity like this again. thanks sellers
"Oh my God article by Max Cherney in Barron’s dated February 22, 2021 “8 chip stocks that are still cheap in a semiconductor shortage “. When chips are selling so well that means the end products such as Apple which use chips are selling well ."
Sold Rocket for a profit and bought 30 more Apple shares. I gotta think that was a good move.
"This stock is not good for short sellers; they can't bring it down. Today all the market was red but this was green. Even during the last several weeks, when market was performing badly, this stock was better. Now is the time; analysts recommended strong and PT is 175 to 225. I will continue buying dips and don't worry even about the market crash. They are trying to scare us."

game stop is the best stock on wall street right now. has the most daily followers to support the stock. it gave investors twice in 2 months a 500% return on your money. no other stock has achieved that performance. 3 to 483. then 40 to 348.50.

Well well well just like magic tech is back! Unbelievable how for one month you didn’t hear any of the funds say one word to defend tech or tech companies come to the defence of their stock. What a conniving business the stock market.
2 more days like this and I'll will add 1000 more shares. For a total of 4000 shares. Watching this like hommer. I just want to be sure that was the bottom.

Are we still on pace for $130 by the end of the week? All the good news seems to be spewing all over the place about Apple this week. Maybe we will hit the $220 mark by the end of the year.
Boris and Natasha wants to breakup and raise tax on large tech. They won’t protect apple’s international patents from China’s piracy. Security on our southern border is being breached like never before. Welcome to the next four years.

"During this pullback, consider a pivot from trading to investing unless you think aapl and other solid stocks will never ever reach their former levels. Don’t forget March 2020 and the millions made by people who understood the market and took advantage of the opportunity."

you guys get faked out so much by futures.. it was down over 1% and recovered at pre-market only to be down during regular hours. the sentiment right now is bearish but you cult followers will get humbled like tesla shareholders did. Baron Capital was a huge Tesla Bull and they ended up selling off Tesla shares. Even the most loyal don't stay loyal very long.
"My price target is $178.50 by the end of 2021. I predicted Apple would push into the EV market 2 months before the news release. Apple don't just make laptops, tablets and so on.. they're disrupters. Clean energy, electric vehicles, VR and so on."

Apple please down. I don’t know where to spend all these gains. Easy little fella
If this drops to low $100’s I’m all in. This stock has already seen a 20% correction . Historically when it’s more than 15% it goes up 40% within 12 months. Sure you can buy another stock and potentially make 200% but Apple is a sure thing . Not going out of business and easy money 
Cnbc are doing the stock Lords work again and spreading the knowledge of apple long term

"a) the economy is reopening, but b) new job growth was of low quality dominated by entry-level service jobs, c) full time jobs shrank as did the workweek, and d) no progress was made in re-employing the longer-termed unemployed. The huge Biden stimulus package will give a nice bounce to retail, likely in the April/May time frame. But, don’t expect much more than a transient impact. Unlike infrastructure spending where the resulting improvements or new developments keep on giving, there are no GDP multiplier impacts from “helicopter” money. It is one and done (that’s why we are on the 3rd “stimulus” package). $SPY $QQQ $AAPL $RUA"

"Good Morning. All I have to say today is ""Hope this Goes UP"". Let's see when the other stocks bounce back where Apple rests."
AAPL is a tech commodity company that will actually benefit from price inflation. Time to drop the A from FANG IMO
"Sorry it's down but since I wasn't pulling any money out of the market anyway, it's time to just not look at the accounts for a few weeks and go for a bike ride. Since AAPL is a solid company, I'd recommend you do the same since there are no losses until you sell."
This is great. Just keep printing money for votes. Gonna be a long 4 years.

If apples down tomorrow no big deal. Sometime before the weekend will see $130
"There is no impetus at this point for Aapl share price to increase much. As a long, who has owned for awhile, I just want to see it stabilize and stop dripping losses almost daily. I have said on this site that $140 at 2021 thanksgiving was realistic. So many shares outstanding, hopefully aapl is able to get it down to 16B outstanding by year end."
"What stocks like GME, KOSS, AMC, LODE ,etc outperform AAPL you know the market is uninvestable."
Buffet typically buys in Thursday or Fridays he has said he’s buying Apple again let’s hope he enters today or tomorrow he will drive it to $130 easily
Checking Apple stock be like...
"Weak hands gone, Strong Apple investors remain. Up we Go !"
"This seems fake. I have feeling that the last 10 mins of the day will see another massive selling to bring the stock price back to 120, of not 119. Guys this is not upward momentum; an upward momentum means a 3% jump...not dilly dalliance between 1 and 1.29%. this is day trading at it finest! Stock splitting was perhaps not a good idea...but what do I know?"
Have to laugh at the IBD article under AAPL entitled “Dow Jones Futures: Be Ready for a Stock Market Rally Pullback or Melt Up”...they’re not covering all the bases; AAPL could just stay the same...
I believe apple will hit $140 come early April. If anything this week has told us is that firms are reallocating their portfolio. Too much was put on SPAC stocks as these gambles aren’t paying off. I suspect fund managers will start to pull out of SPAC and put buy back into Apple. Let’s not forget APPLE has always been a strong stock with good demand and innovation.
"Occasional price drops are no reason to sell, but to acquire more. Strong company with a great long term outlook."

This is a favorite because the dip creates a higher premium on puts then which sell off with the second rallyHistorical prices indicate that both $119+ as an intra day low and $123+ as an intra day high printed twice. So, there is a 90% chance of a third print"

"I bet people are taking notes but I'll mention this anyway! The other day it was posted to be fair since AAPL dipped $2_ from previous close down to $119 it had to now run $2 from that $121+ close. Yesterday, it printed $123+.That $4+ pivot yielded 100to 400% in algorithim profits. Earlier this week, the profits were similar.Yesterday at the close the stock was up almost at the highs of the day but the volume on March 12 calls was huge and price down. Thus this pre-market's dip.Fridays anything can and does happen. WHy? There is little premium on options"
My dream re-entry price is approaching and I remain bullish as a long term investor in Apple.

Apple has been way over sold for the past two months and the way the market has been acting most smart investors want a safe haven for their money. I believe investors want a strong company with a great balance sheet that's profitable and has proven products! AAPL meets all of those plus a dividend!
I feel sorry for the hesitant people who didn’t buy last weeks discount.
Apple is going to double anytime on news of the ICAR wait for it stay invested
Everything goes up. Intel did too. We too shall rise. Give it a few more weeks.
Dow futures up 225 points and Nasdaq futures up 67 points . Dow could be up over 10% or more this coming week and Nasdaq could be up over 10% this week. However I would not be surprised if they are up even more

Can someone please explain to me with fundamentals why Apple is not recovering from its downturn for the last 3 weeks. Like this is not how investing works where you lose your gains and get them back a month later for a minimal return vs other investments

"I bought apple in 2011 worth of 63000 Canadian dollars at 221 and at that time I phone 4 was at its peak . for some reason I listen to a friend who told me to sell because these phone companies are not good for long term . look what happened to blackberry from 180 to 29 at that time . also Samsung is coming up with similar phone with better camera. I got scared and sold my apple at 236.if I kept my 285 shares of apple, today after 7:1 split in 2014 and 4:1 split in 2020, I would have 7981 share at price 135.37. this will be worth 1,080,509.86 today.so please do not make my mistake and panic and sell.Apple is here to stay and grow. billions of loyal customers , high quality products, great innovations, diversified services, EV in the horizon.I went back to Apple at the beginning of Pandemic and loaded with 1200 share below 300 price.will never sell Apple"

no way to up trend in short period of time until April month
I’ve been invested long enough in Apple to see a $10 gain in one day
"Don't forget Apple was at 130; dropped to 120 February 26 and went up to 129 on March 1, 2021. Again it dropped to 116 on March 8 with the market correction and went up to 125.57 on March 16. So it has a good strength to bounce back?"
"Money Watch has a very interesting article. A man 52 years old with $1.6 million in investments and $0.3 million in a house wants to retire from the rat race and the politics (as he say). Market Watch went on and on but the response was not very satisfactory to me. With no family he should continue with mutual funds such as from Fidelity etc etc. Buy some excellent funds such as Fidelity Select semiconductor, Fidelity Blue Chip Growth (if closed they will direct you to another fund), Fidelity small capital growth, OTC, Growth Companies etc etc etc and you withdraw as need basis and you will do great. Lucky to have that kind of money. Yes health insurance is expensive but you can fish for the best plans whether Managed Care, HMO, PPO till you become eligible for Medicare (A is free you have to pay for B and additional D which covers all prescriptions not paid by D. The rest of them after D are Medicare Managed Care Programs with different clauses)"
Futures are so red. Be prepared for another blood bath. Stay strong! Probably best to not see the market tomorrow 
Market will digest Fed and rally for the next two days....it is absolutely the best news for stocks
this can run over $128 tomo on this positive Apple Car news buy in early before it goes back to $140 people
"So the past two weeks were great weeks for banks and energy sector. Once that does, all the money comes back to tech! Have a nice weekend!"
"Go opposite of the herd, when they start selling .... buy!"
More upgrades and higher price on it’s way. I can just see his excellency Warren Buffett laughing his heart  our. No wonder he was able and is able to give an yearly average return of 23.3% to his investors since 1959. WOW
I really think that doubling the dividend would cause very little pain but a lot of gain for AAPL.
"Its been months since Apple announced a 4 for 1 stock split ..All the good news , RECORD earnings , raising their dividend and still hasn't come close to any of the price targets ! I think it's in the group of most manipulated stocks now . Wall Street says..... You think this is easy money ???? We sell on purpose and will let you know when it will rise ! No reason this should be in the red after all these months !"
I don’t need to sell any Apple  shares now or for the next few years. Still sleeping well at night
"AAPL have been oversold and is undervalued for months compared to other unknown companies. With the 1.9T approval and more of apple news, we can see apple 125 to 130 by middle of March."
"I command apple to change to TOP gear! start engines! I have been waiting too long. I need to see $160 somewhere in the next couple of months! who do I call to make that happen? A common man can dream, right?!"
"In the stock market: long term investing. Buy the dip. Stocks on sale. Never fear. Market akwat bull in the long run. Remember what happened after March 2020. Yes, John bought so much."
Apple is working daily buy buy buy at this discount
Well my target was to make a 25% return on my investment. I am down around 25% which is a good thing as I always buy the dips. I am very confident by end of year I would have made my 25% in AAPL after buying the dips.. How low will it go? I have no idea.. But I will keep buying.. My strategy buy a little every 5 dollar drop.. My last buy in was 118..next buy in 113 if it falls that low.. GLTA
What’s going on with Apple today? Market is green but Apple $117
Bitcoin may be the only thing not affected by the Interest rates or the federal government???
Write cash backed puts for September and let someone else take the time risk
Apple has announced that it plans to create a major new chip lab in Munich as part of a 1 billion euro ($1.19 billion) plus investment into Germany over the next three years.Never underestimate Apple's determination to WIN.
"Treasury yields haven’t been this low relative to U.S. economic growth estimates since 1966. That suggests the climb in rates may still have room to run.Disconnect: “We just have too much stimulus coming into the system. It’s going to combine the growth with a very rapid acceleration in inflation. In the old days bond yields should equal to nominal GDP. Things are very different now. But to what degree they are different? Can you have 1% negative real yield and 10% nominal GDP?”Analysts are boosting their growth and inflation forecasts. The average projection for nominal gross domestic product hit a 32-year high of 7.6% in Bloomberg surveys. Even after doubling to 1.6% since November, 10-year bond rates can barely keep up with the growth upgrade, leaving the gap between the two likely to be the largest since Lyndon Johnson was president.$SPY $QQQ $RUA $DIA $AAPL"
"Here's the truth: APPL was a fully valued company a year ago, yet the price has doubled since March. Doubled. Now, for a true growth company, that's understandable, but this is a 50 year old company. The stock price could increase eventually or it could stay in this overvalued range for a while. Sure, you can collect a dividend while you wait, but it's .8 percent, so at that point a bond looks more appealing. Do what you will though."
Nasdaq down 1%Down Jones and SP up slightly.Money has been shifting from tech to commodities like Oil stocks
i hope to see 128 today!
Somebody call Steve ...
Is Buffett buying in right now?
"This is Apple people. It’s the worlds biggest company so it’s always going to be a slow grower. It’s the worlds best company so the fundamentals will always solidify the foundation. Buy Apple, Hold Apple and Profit from Apple Be patient and don’t let Emotion take over!"
"I have 11,500 shares. Recently I bought 1500 at 118.60. I think I am going to sell those 1500 to buy an Marshal Tube Stack. I will hold off as long as possible. Thanks to Biden I bought a Gibson ES-335 with the money I made off the XLE."

Man! This thing is just dogggggging it today. Except for that Friday a couple of weeks back this is the worst day in a while. 15 DMA violated. Rally attempts have been feeble. Any buying is met with immediate selling While this thing has been range bound for a while it is not taking anywhere near the beating smaller NASDAQ stocks are taking. As an Apple April call option holder it might be time to bail. Certainly if we get one more day like this one.
"Well if minimum wage is raised to 15$ wouldn’t that nock most low income people off there eligibility for government subsidies?No more food stamp , no more free healthcare, no more renters help , etc etc you make money now , Pay your bills now?"
"U traders can play with the price, the longs wont sell it, we just add more, simple as that."
"Folks, there is every reason in the world to buy now. I don't think you are going to see 120 or slightly lower for very long, ESPECIALLY with earnings coming up and the fact Apple has been stagnant for months. It's time for the boom and I think it's coming sooner rather than later. We were at 120 back as late as October. That is 6 months of zero growth. This stock can't be held down much longer. Just make sure you are in when it begins its upward swing. I think it will get up to 137 by the time earnings are here. Possibly 140 or above."
Apple getting ready to run to 126.50 next week. I called the Tim Cook and he suggested I get the Gibson Exclusive Les Paul Standard 60s AAA Flamed Top Guitar with Case Bourbon Burst. I agree so I am going to need this to run up to 126.50.
"be smart sell appple ,you loss more money. because yourmoney tide in with apple cant buy something that will make you muchmuch bigger money. last friday my friend sold apple and bought 7000 share ncty32.50 . sold ncty today sold at 47.30 made 100,000 thousand"

I’m getting tired losing money on apple everyday
"Let me share another story, : last two January's, based on AAPL's stock action We made lemonade out of lemons returning 1000% in a week in 2021 and 1800% in a month 2010.No! WE did not ""muscle"" the stock.Like Bruce Lee was said..."" Be water, Flow like Water""Stay Long"
"Jack Denton Market Watch March 4, 2021 “buy this dip in Apple , Microsoft and these other tech stocks before they’re out of your reach”."
So oversold...
"Apple’s iOS 14.5 is set to launch very soon, with a bunch of really cool new features for your iPhone. As new iOS 14.5 features continue to be revealed via the beta release, it looks likely that this could be Apple’s most stunning iOS 14 update yet for those who care about security and privacy.That’s because Apple confirmed this week that its Safari browser is going to be even more private by bypassing Google’s Safe Browsing in favor of its own servers. Specifically, the new iPhone privacy feature redirects Google Safe Browsing traffic through Apple’s own proxy servers to enhance user privacy and avoid giving any data to Google.Previously, Apple would send an encoded version of the site’s address to Google’s Safe Browsing to be compared with Google’s list of fraudulent sites. But the issue with this was, Google could see your IP address. The new Apple feature means Safari will protect this information when you browse on your iPhone, resulting in more privacy (and less reliance on Google)."
"I would not be surprised if Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are up at least 10% next week. The stimulus bill has passed and money will start showing in your accounts I would say within the next week. I predict lot of it will be invested by the States and other regulatory agencies in the market. As for individuals getting $1400 each it could into food, electronics such as I -Phones etc etc. All this will also increase the GDP (multiplier affects). Lots of my friends are also going to invest in the stock market and mutual funds. They need the money but they also want to build a future by investing. Lastly my estimate of the market going up by 10% next week is just an estimate. It could go even higher."
"The market fears inflation, especially the Tech sector. The FED wants inflation. This isn't gonna go away any time soon. Hold your tech stocks and put some money into dividend stocks to protect your portfolio. Just don't panic because that does nothing but give you an ulcer"
Nothing is going up. The rotation talk is a lie. Money is leaving the stock market.
I'm a first time buyer and been loading up slowly averaging about $120 in the past couple wks. Do you guys think this is a solid base price. I kind of want it to go lower but I know it will pick up.

This will open $125 tomorrow market is very green and bullish tomo
Apple stores moving into target!!! Incredible company!!!
I just picked up some more AAPL on the dip. I couldn’t resist the bargain!
The yoyo action between 119-125 will continue until the earnings in a month or so. No catalyst in sight!
On the bright side - another $6 run like Monday and we’d be back to $130
"Love it, I'm an Apple long and everytime the price drop I see shares repurchased at a lower price. The buyback $ does not change by Apple only the number of shares that can be bought, then again all long term holders know that!!I recall last year prior to the split some investors asking for a split, something I was not too keen on because this is what happens with a lower stock price, more volatility, cheaper stock options to mess around with the price. Long term this will all flatten out and start to go up again!!"
COOK NEEDS TO ENERGIZE AAPL STOCK LIKE MUSK DOES EVERY TIME. INVESTORS AND EMPLOYEES LOVE IT. COOK IS GETTING TOO MANY BIG BONUSES FOR UNDER PERFORMING. AAPL SHOULD BE AT 155 BY NOW.
$AAPL announced building EV with Foxconn/Fisker - EV w Siri will be much better than $TSLA's model cars.
"If you look at the AAPL chart 3 month and 6 month high-low channel, we are at the low end of the channel in an overall upward direction. AAPL is due to swing back up soon to head to the upper part of the channel. Good buy time!"
"Been a long time lover of AAPL since 2010. They won't allow stock to move to quickly but here is what's happening ROOKIES. The stock is in a heavy consolidation mode. Higher highs and higher lows. If this pattern is not broken to the downside soon, this stock will POP. Problem is, it will test your patience and move sideways until it doesn't. Only thing holding it right now are the options traders, too many have 140 calls for this to zoom past that number. Expect expirations and this to move accordingly. Thank me later folks, FerrariJoe is out."
"Now that the hedge funds got all their options covered, can we please have control of our stock again?"
"Stimulus in the bank any time. Apple stores opening, Apple event this month. Lookout $150"
"Ok people, here is the deal. Apple is not going to move until its ready, it will have nothing to do with the market or any news. every few months we go through the same exact situation that we are in right now., but it always comes back. Don't know if its tomorrow or a month from now, my guess is we will get a really soon prior to next earnings and I also know that they are going to kill the numbers. I also think that they will have a forecast for the next quarter and that will make the stock rally too. Do not be surprised to see a $20 move by sometime in April before earnings."
Thanks Wedbush
"Despite our day, AAPL will still outperform the market. Buying on the discount."
Tim Cook and Apple should have bought VIAC and added Paramount+ content for Apple TV+. VIAC stock is absolutely on fire and he could have purchased this company for pennies on the dollars a year ago. Now it will cost $125-$150 a share for VIAC.
770K newly unemployed is good because it wasn't over 800K is the narrative? This is complete madness.
"As COVID vaccines roll out and the economy gets revved back up, AAPL will struggle to be Comp quarters from 2020. This is what I see is driving the stock price down.Not interested in  or  Just looking to see if any open minded people can answer a simple question.Where will Aapl bottom out? aim VERY a interested in buying, any chartists out there that see anything telling.This is still one of, if not THE best company in the world. Good luck to all longs! Thanks!"
Apple is ready to take to a higher level when they get into the EV market!
Even overseas investors are buying into the United States market because they see a big upsurge in the market due to the stimulus money pouring into the market.

"Airlines, cruise ships , hotels, oil, are getting bids. I wouldn’t put 2 cents in those sectors. They are already overvalued. Tech is always king and the sector will catch some bids sooner than later. One of these days you will have the talking heads say tech is oversold. We bottom in March and clear sailing in April."
Looks like the stimulus bill has passed. Should be a wonderful and a very very positive affect on the market next week. Apple is the Rock Star of the entire market
"With Buffet selling AAPL and Ark Invest continued selling as recently as Friday 2/26, they both agreed that current price can still go down. The plunge on Friday at the end of the day tells you where this is going next week. The current trend is downward and can fall to $95-$105, but long term (in 5-10 years) AAPL will remain the flagship of all tech products and will continue to trend up. However, I do believe that in order for AAPL to go from $2T to $4T, they will need a new product category (cars, VR headset?) which could still be years away."
Would you sit on the beach and complain the water is too high with each wave coming in or too low with each wave going out? This is literally what the traders are doing on this forum.
such a laggard today. even after huge mkt. comeback. stay long!
Eventually there will be a point where someone will start buying for the long term.......

"Here are the Apple returns for every year of the last decade. I started acquiring Apple stock in the earlier part of 2014 and have never sold a share. Apple has had several lulls through the years, but the results speak for themselves. 2010 53.07% 2011 25.56% 2012 32.24% 2013 8.07% 2014 40.62% 2015 (-3.01%) 2016 12.48% 2017 48.46% 2018 (-5.34%) 2019 88.96% 2020 82.31%"
This is why you hold!
Nice but it needs a few weeks of follow through. No stock goes up every day but it needs to trend higher. At $135 is where institutional investors will be convinced imo
down down she goes

Anyone here buy AMD back in 2016 when it was under $5? I did and held it through some rough times and never gave up. Sold it right before Covid cashed out and put everything into Apple. Cost average is $112 with 2500 shares. I’m not going to let this get me down. Apple  will come back as it always does. Hold long and don’t let days like this disappoint you.

"Getting ready to buy more tomorrow. 11,650 shares and counting. I think I want an even 13,000 shares. This is to good a deal to pass up. Apple is the big winner folks. The weak hands have folded."
When a company like Apple has so much money that it doesn't know what to do with it and is trying to return to cash neutral. That's a usually a good sign that it's a good investment.
we want cheap apples. Thanks. We ain't putting more money in so cash out and put your money in a cyclical stock now!!!! we want cheap apples!!! boycott apples!!

"I think they could do better on the dividend. Better than nothing i guess, a whopping 80 bucks i got paid on dividend today."
10 year is down slightly. Honestly I think this is holding up pretty well given the drop in the NAZ AAPL down just 1%.

"True longs don’t try and time Apple or trade, just when you sell an announcement will be made and the stock will soar. Hold tight! Don’t have weak hands"
So u sold? Now what? You have a cap gains tax bill resulting in less money to buy with and at most likely a higher price too....not a smart move
Tech has been played out. AAPL needs 20 PE at max. It's usual PE is 12-15. Rising rates.. I see this down to 81 support. Be safe.
12.5% correction very healthy for this market....cleans out the weak hands and continues the bull market. Corrections happen about once every 1.5 years or so. This one was way overdue
"I said it at $130...better find a way to stop the bleeding. Now $122 with no bottom in range. Don’t know what to tell you other than ALL longs got this WRONG. Consensus was “good earnings, $150 in sight”. Not even close."

Bears forget the last two stimulus helped the market. $1400 to each person means tons of iphones and apple products getting bought this quarter and the next And if inflation occurs thats fine more money for an iphone more profit more buybacks
Why raise taxes? Why pay for stuff? Makes no sense. The GOP has shown the way. Tax cut and spend!
I wouldn't be surprised to see AAPL 70% higher by years end.
Fridays anything can happen.I would NOT be selling calls.

"I love my Apple Watch Series 6. The sleep measurements are very cool. I never tracked my sleep before, but I find myself charging it before I go to bed and it has improved my patterns in a short period of time.Apple Pay - VERY COOL. I am a fan of the Disney Magic Band and this operates the same way. Double click of the inner button and my cards (loyalty included) are right there. Got some gas today, bam, didn't even have to get out my wallet. Leaving the house, in a Hurry? cant find your phone, ping it through the watch. I cannot tell you how many times this has shaved minutes off of my eventual departure. If time is money, and you operate through a JIT strategy, this is such a great product.AND last but not least.... the camera function. You can see on your watch what the phone lens is looking at simply by opening the camera app on your watch. Hit the button, smile and three seconds later, your former selfie now has that professional touch."

"Bill passes the House. Mr. B will sign it into law. Checks should be in via electronic transfer to your account within a week . Like I said yesterday not all is going towards stimulus checks. Some of it goes to States, Schools, State Agencies etc . All of that will immediately be invested in the stock market except the ones which are immediately due for payments. The stimulus package analysis has shown that at least 40% will be invested in the market. My estimate is between $350 billions to $500 billions will be invested in the market mostly in stocks and mutual funds , a little in bonds and money market funds but the bulk in the stock market. So take my advise and quickly buy into the market before the Dow goes to 50,000 and S&P and Nasdaq even better percentage wise."
Right now Apple is trading at a net cash forward PE of 23....talk about being undervalued for the number one ranked brand in the world also with the worlds stickiest products....
with the stimulus passed. this will be $135-$140 this week!!
Did they announce the actual dividend increase yet?
The reopening trades must be getting close to being at fair value. How much lower can this go?
"All week I saw $127 then yesterday AAPL printed $127.Lately, I have been seeing a higher number.Good Luck"
Love AAPL
"Sorry this is my fault, i bought in on the first dip."
Happy with 121 ;)
Get the stimulus...And then the market takes that amount away and then someAin't it Cool
Thought Apple was the safest place to invest?
"Buffet: ""Buffett also signaled a long-term commitment to Apple Inc , where Berkshire ended 2020 with $120.4 billion of stock despite recently selling several billion dollars more.He called Apple and the BNSF railroad Berkshire's most valuable assets - ""it's pretty much a toss-up"" - other than its insurance operations, and ahead of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. ""The family jewels,"" he called those four investments."""
The MF who thing that treasury bond is a good investment even with 5% yield don’t deserve to invest in stock market in the first place.
"Apple Stock Could Surge 62% to $225, According to This AnalystShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have already climbed 79% over the past year, but will surge to new all-time highs in 2021.That's according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Today, Ives raised his price target on Apple's stock to $175from $160, but also laid out a bull case for why the stock could climb to as high as $225. His new base target represents potential gains for investors of roughly 26% over the stock's closing price of about $139 on Friday. It's his compelling argument for the bull case, however, that should have investors more excitedlives cited the potential for ""eye-popping"" iPhone sales, saying that checks of Apple's supply chain in Asia showed strong demand for the device. The analyst now believes Apple could have sold as many as 90 million iPhones during the December quarter, roughly 35% over the analyst's already robust forecast. Ives sees this upward trend continuing over the March and June quarters.""We believe based on the current trajectory and in a bull case Cupertino has potential to sell north of 240 million units (~250 million could be in the cards -- an eye-popping figure)"" Ives wrote in a note to clients, ""which would easily eclipse the previous Apple record of 231 million units sold in [fiscal year 2015].""Will Apple stock hit $225?There have long been prognostications of a supercycle for the iPhone maker. It has an installed base of more than 1.4 billion active devices, with the iPhone accounting for an estimated 950 million of those. The current thinking suggests that as many as 350 million iPhone buyers could upgrade their device this year. To put that number in context, Apple sold roughly 185 million iPhones in 2019. Given the demand for a 5G-enabled iPhone, and the number of devices due for an upgrade, it's certainly possible Apple could sell 89% more iPhones in 2021 -- but that's certainly a high bar."
It’s not Apple it’s everything today. Everyone got hammered
"Apple's annual shareholders meeting is set to take place on February 23, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time,"
"Apple is in discussions with multiple suppliers of self-driving lidar car sensors, according to people familiar with the matter, a key milestone toward development of its first passenger vehicle."
If you got GUTS to go long and want generational wealth.. now is a decent price to make your wealth in the sand today with AAPL as a foundational block to build from
Tomorrow markets will rise MASSIVLY....especially apple and Intel.
I am only stating the obvious but the $120 line give or take some is holding strong. If today it does not sell down to low 119s we are good to sit back and enjoy steady gains until summer back up to 150 range.
"how is it AAPL is a laggard and IBM is solid runner ,, HOW ,, what did IBM do so right"
"* BREAKING NEWS*Apple (AAPL) to announce new car on Wednesday called the Jalopy. Will have same value of this stock soon, worthess! Bahahahahahaahahaha"
"This is going to turn soon either by some news or just a sign of being over sold, not sure if today or tomorrow or Monday, but it will."
"Futures are beginning to show a dramatic improvement. Government announced that the stimulus checks will begin to get to you electronically as early as this week and definitely next week . So examine your checking and or saving account. One thing is for sure that lot of it will go into the market as investments. Saw a study wherein the younger generation wants to either buy a new I-phone or invest it in the market and around 50% said they will invest it in the market. Which would equal to anywhere between $350 billions to $600 billions. God that’s a lot of money going into the market. Had you invested $1,000 with Warren Buffett in 1959 you could be worth millions upon millions of dollars in terms of current dollar some say as high as $76 millions. Yes you heard it right $76 millions . Because Warren’s average return since 1959 has been 23.3% yearly. I told that to my kids and they are following an investment procedure which has a long term horizon and a long term view."
Shorts holding out but will have to cover soon!!!
Dear average AAPL investor. If you have a year + time horizon just turn off Yahoo and live your lives.
Is there any point in talking about resistance or support for AAPL any longer. Just when it looked promising FLUSH there go two days of gains.
Buffet buying his shares back.
Seems to point towards a strong day in nasdaq and S&P but if it’s too strong it’ll just have to fall back again
Futures doesn't matter. The sell off is going to start again. I see 81.
We should see $125 tomo a lot of volume and people stayed invested today! Looks very green tomo
There is no way 3 trillion dollars put into the economy won't cause inflation. Been to the gas station or supermarket lately?
Your boy Biden is making Apple and Tesla great again..... lmao. The entire S and P 500 and most likely the Nasdaq will be red for the year going into 2022. Thank you for your votes for him. He's done wonders for the two markets.
Yesterday was predictable.Hopefully today will not be.
Heading on up
My guess is trend reversal begin tomorrow.
apple just lost another lawsuit
"remember apple will only go up 70 points in a condensed 4 week period. don't trade it daily. do nothing, and you will be pleasantly surprised."
Scary how controlled this market has now become. You’re better off buying a few investment properties right now and making monthly income
Making some quick decisions within the next 14 minutes: Should I buy more Apple or Fidelity Blue Chip Growth with Apple as a major holding! I think I will go with a 50:50 ratio. Both are great and fine investments
It's just nine days 'til spring.
Apple is known to under perform post split! Give it some time and this stock will be back to 500 a share.
LEAK LEAK from the street. Hedgies will cover after 3.30 Pm ET. They won't leave money overnight due to mellenials . buy buy before hedgies cover. AAPL 130 in pre market will happen
AAPL is the best value stock now!
"This board should act as for informational purpose only like upcoming Apple events, products. Do not do buy or sell recommendation guys. I would not be here if I don’t own Apple shares. So we need constructive discussion. Do you do buys or sell based on what others tell you?"
Checking status on Apple stock today be like...
"A Counterpoint report has stated that Apple managed to sell over 9.5 million iPhones in the US market alone in December 2020. This gave the iPhone 12 maker a huge 64% of the market share, leaving Samsung in second on 20%. Google managed to claw back some share thanks to the Pixel 4a and Pixel 5, but Motorola and Alcatel are firmly in ZTE territory."
Looks like the 10 year bond yield is lower. Excellent news for stocks
"My group is buying at the open before millennials buy with their stimulus this week and start a SHORT SQUEEZE. Hedgies knows that, millennials will buy AAPL and it will squeeze shorties very soon. I will buy more to squeeze more shorties. At this level of 121 is huge discount. The more we buy and accumulate the more explosive the short squeeze will become."
Apple is now considered dead money! Even Ives the analysis can’t help it! $2 Trillion market cap is over the Top!Even $1 Trillion in these times of trouble!But you do you!Fiona
AAPL CAN JUMP 10 DOLLARS IN ANY SESSION ON OVERSOLD PARAMETERS. STORES ARE OPEN AND NO COMPETITION TO NY PRODUCTS AND NEW IMACS ARE SOON TO BE ANNOUNCED
"This stock will rock when it starts. It a buy right now, take it and run."
"Being patient with AAPL but, it may take time...It's OK. I have owned it for more than 10 years..."
Lower highs and lower lows in the intraday
Powell will keep the BuyDone Bubble going The big sell off will come when Dementia Joe is replaced by Camel Toe Harris
Remember the good old days when Apple climbed regardless of the market. Yeah I bought the day before that trend ended!!!!!
When will apple announce its new div increase?
"Dear Tim,Please buy back as many shares as you can to prevent hedge funds from manipulating your stock on a daily basis and treating it as their personal piggy bank. P.S. please announce Apple Car soon. We need some momentum.Regards,Apple Long Investor"
yo ladies and gentlemen unemployment claims lower than expected. We will see positive day today and for the rest of march 2021. Yes siri bob we are going up. Businesses are opening up. Retailers are doing goody good. Stimulus on its way. Buyeth more today and or go long folks. Thanko
"If there is No pre-market or early am trading AAPL can rally.WHen one ""telegraphs"" their punch they get KO'd."
Texas will unleash its economy right before the stim handouts. Great move to get Texas mid and small businesses a boost instead of people feeding the beast of Amazon
So much doom and gloom here. People were buying this like hotcakes at 140. We will go back up and quickly.
I also agree it looks really bad when this happens to a company with record earnings every quarter and cook says nothing to support his stock or shareholders. I have been long Apple for years. Still am but I don’t like cooks style with all the secrecy around products
What do you think Apple is gonna do with all of its dollars eh? It’s gonna buy the safest asset it can think of. Itself.
Buffet sold some not all. Not a concern.. I do think the stock has been a dud for a while now. The day I sell the stock will move up 5 pts. Still holding .
AAPL lifted my portfolio today!
Apple price target raised at Evercore with $225 bull case on long-term growth ( seeking alpha )
At this point AAPL just needs a reason to fall. Microsoft and others have fallen for tech sell off but were also quick to recover. AAPL is trading sideways since September 2020. Time for me to think about cutting the losses on this.
SELL SELL SELL. SHORT TERM APPLE IS GOING <$115..................SELL SELL SELL
It will be a big news once apple reach again 2T market cap somwhere in 2022.
WOW Biden is not helping here and ironically aapl help get him in.
I am sure this week is another week every day green record high after record higher
"AAPL will go up to $126 on Monday March 1, 2021"
"The average p/e , price to earning rating for AAPL is 19. Currently trades over 30. It'll go back to 19 and stock price will go below 90. Look it up yourself"
Mar 23th New products coming out! Anyone knows what?
"This economy not likely to recover as fast as market anticipates. Combine this with high inflation, and we revisit the “stagflation” of the late ‘70s—ironically under an identical administration...now just waiting for the Iranians to take hostages..."
Makes no sense that AAPL has fallen from 140 to 116 after reporting the greatest earnings of any company ever in history. 112 Billion revenue in 3 months.
"The current valuation at only 25x forward earnings is a total bargain. This is the basement for Apple as secular strength in core iPhone business plus 5G expansion will continue to build momentum. This has to go up from here, but I am glad I bought the dip at $118 and change"
"Back to august 2020 prices. If you would invest the same amount in Bitcoin back in august 2020, you would’ve been a millionaire."
Buffett published his investment firm owns 5.4% of Apple.
this market will not go high but higher the fed printing press will bring thie Dow to the moon to 35.000 points.....
"HEIR YAHOO WILL MOST LIKELY CENSOR THIS MESSAGE.But here goes.We find it deplorable that Heir Yahoo never mentioned Appl's event, today"
"Apple price target raised to $175 from $163 at Evercore ISIEvercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani raised the firm's price target on Apple to $175 from $163 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares, telling investors that he sees the company being positioned to sustain mid-single digit percentage sales growth and mid-teens percentage total return over the next several years. The analyst, who sees Apple having another set of ""multi-billion"" dollar opportunities that could further drive value creation, thinks the company remains attractively positioned, he added."
Anybody want to place any bets what day of the week king cuomo steps down?
"many don’t understand.the fed has no power to stop rates from rising if the market forces them to.bond yields at intrest rates work together.the fed cannot control both at the same time period.the market has control of yields,the fed rates.forget the fact that the fed has to borrow money to keep yields down for now.in japan the use yield control to keep bond yeilds at a low rate so as they borrow money the intrest they pay stays low.its called contractionary monetary policy.the fed is already buying 80 billion in bonds and 40 billion in mbs -mortgage backed securities per month.this kept yields low until they passed 1.9 trillion in covid relief.the market decided that risk went up and bonds yields needed to be higher.look at the rise since the election.if the fed wants to keep yields in check they must buy more bonds and print more money.yield control is a risky game because inflation will skyrocket because of all the money printing or debt accumulation needed to buy an ever changing amount of bonds to keep yields where they want them to be ......low,that makes the dollar worth less.the only move the fed can make while controlling yields is to raise rates ,that will control inflation by limiting the amount of easy money available in the economy.but doing that restricts gdp growth.is complicated but the short of it is with all the money printing and rising debt,rates will go up.when is the question and the answer is when the market forces them to go up.thats why japan has pretty much 0 gdp growth for 20 years now.its average less than 1 % in 20 years.because they have little domestic consumption due to high intrest rates,becuase of yeild controls.so the fed lets bond yields rise and it costs the fed more to issue debt,the curve between what the fed pays to get money and what the fed gets to lend money out gets bigger.the debt rises more and yeilds rise more.eventually they need to raise rates to get money to pay the debt.rates go up.or they try yeild control,and then raise rates to stop uncontrollable inflation which restricts gdp growth.either way rates increase Dont fool yourself"
Suggest NO pre-market or am trading.When there are no dips in the am AAPL runs nicely
James Suva Citigroup “Apple will soon see a three thrillion dollar market soon because of Apple Car
"Hey Joe, how about that Hunter ?"
"I'm a long term holder here....and I'm holding long into the future yet for these reasons:1. Best tech brand2. China trade war easing. Apple gonna pick up more momentum there.3. India just getting started4. 5g just getting started5. Apple has all the tech we're using daily in our lives (phones, laptops, earphones, etc.) It's essential.6. Increasing dividend. Every single year.7. Stock buybacks8. New products to come (EV, AR/VR headset, services)9. Apple finding ways to lower costs (M1 chips, production in Vietnam, etc.)10. Apple values privacy...and the world is waking up to privacy being important because we all know that the likes of FB and TWTR and even Google abuse your data."
Why this stock keeps falling?
Stimulus checks means iphone sales... most iphone fans still do not have 5G apple phones.
New apple keynote ....if new iMacs would be revealed the stock price will pop +10%.
We all are long term investors because we are losing now
"Stop trading Apple and you have nothing to worry about!! Lower the price the more shares that get bought back each quarter, long term that is only a positive fore those who will still hold the stock in years to come:)"
Don’t lose hope boys. Apple will be playing catch up next week. Wait until summer when the details of the new iphone start getting leaked along with new Apple silicon. Everyone loves Apple products and will be upgrading. I have everything in Apple and will keep buying... even with the stimulus gift. $180 this summer and 200 by Christmas.
Did the big boys knock this down the last few weeks so they can get a lower entry point?
Nice trend today. Let's see green 3 of the next 5 trading days to establish a reversal. Should see upper $120's in a few weeks. Remember a massive earnings report could not hold this stock in the $140's. My guess is we are waiting for a catalyst to exceed $140 pps. It will happen. Always does.
Remember stocks rotate. Money rotates. The money is rotating or another sector. They will make money and sell and then come back to tech. Long.
any prediction for tomorrow?
"Look at the chart, do you see it EVER stay down for long? No. One of the best companies in the world. If you sell, you know nothing at all about investing.."
Hold an buy more at the dip
Interesting video on CCIV and apple.... $CCIV Lucid Motors Partnering with $AAPL Apple!?! - YouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vbtiIr6Ev8
This is undervalued stock !!!
"just a market ""head fake"". Wait till April and the market will speak, let it come to u."
Apple now on a tear. We shook out the weak hands and this family jewel is ready to shine. Like a lovely shiny green Emerald. The most precious of the precious stones. This train has left the station . 
market is popping rising tide and aapl is down imagine a down day
By removing trumps tax cuts - you’re raising taxes sleepy joe!
One can not be angry at anyone for being who they are.so AAPL yesterday bounced off of $120+. That was a third print.WE are at fault for not paying attention.Two prints in the $130+'s await.
When the stock starts its move and continues .. Buyers will move in. Volume up and squeeze will began. Go Apple.. It wont be much longer..
Congratulations to Rush Limbaugh on 1 month of sobriety!
"AAPL & AMD post excellent earnings - stock price is suppressed. Someone is collecting MASSIVE call option premiums and robbing those of us who bought very conservative, no brainer (at the time) calls on these companies. A bunch of Wall St. Thieves manipulating the market. Apple as a company - not a care in the world and business as usual. Options holders are getting killed, and I believe this is part of the goal here."
Cancel your sell orders for a week and watch this going to $150 100%
"Should expect a Strong Rally back above $135+ tomorrow, Load up before too late."
Hmmm. Futures looking bad. But then again - apple doesn’t really depends on the futures anymore
"If you can do the match calculating the compound increase e.g. 115% ^ 20, you should know you will do well in the future by buying and holding. The strategy of making money quick just doesn’t exist. But long-term compounding increase is far more powerful."
It’s not a bad start. We’ll get to 130 this week :)
Huge buying opportunity!!!
Oil up 3.25 % on top of yesterday's 4.5%. This is a giant tax on everything. Be careful.
"This is funny: Albert Vilella@AlbertVilella·3h#biotech #stocks sorting by volume and marking a few outliers. Notice that the ticker starting with BN and ending with GO is at the almost top, together with trillion $ companies such as $TSLA or $AAPL . Remarkable that $BFLY is at such high volume given its modest valuation."
Don't listen to these shorts because they want you to sell in order to make money. Due your own due diligence and understand the quality of the stock. There is no negative news so I'm holding it strong. Just wait for the right volume to come in.
"Many factors have combined resulting in fall for AAPL in last 3 weeks:1. Buy the rumour sell the news phenomenon happened on earnings call.2. Stock went till 131 and rebounded to 137.3. Last week, WB and Institutional buyers dumped lot of shares as they booked profits in AAPL and invested in recovery stocks.4. And, lastly this week the general trend of sell offs in all big tech companies; money moved to bonds, recovery stocks and commodities have dragged down the sector."
"In my opinion this sell off in FAANG and other big tech has overshoot to the downside. The 10-Yr Bond is still very low despite the fact it came up a lot % wise. It's up from 0.5, which is very very low.$AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $NFLX, $AMZN."
Seems like CNBC does not want Covid to ever end.......
Honestly if you load up a big chunk in these 120 118 zones you can sell for a solid gain at 130s when this fad is over
"This correction will reverse soon. Since the early 1900s, the S&P 500 has tended to fall 5% from recent highs a few times a year -- and notches a steeper 10% or more plunge about once every year to year and a half. These events are always temporary and reverse course again quickly. If looking for a “crash”, that already happened last March."
Don’t forget today is option Friday. Looks like 120 is working hard to gain control.
"Lost my faith in this all 8 months of gains gone away ,i still hold it but i am fedup now"
"Down $25 since high , What's the outlook on Apple ? It seems that ever company that doesn't give guidance falls quite big even with good revenue . Is there something more to this ? I'm lost at trying to figure out why my portfolio is tanking while somehow the markets are at all time records . Too many companies are way over valued ?"
"Apple $150 calls January 2023. Buy now, thank me later."
Buyer at 95. Correction part deux coming be patient
"Frankly, APPL held it's own today in a down NASDAQ......this stock will move up in the next week"
love the buying opp to increase my shares Will be UP like a yoyo
Why is Tesla up 18% and Apple up a mere 4% ??? What has Elon got that Cook ain't got?
"Time to stop looking at stocks. Delete market apps, don’t watch CNBC, just enjoy spring and summer then check back in the fall."
150$ next earnings
"Time for Apple  to turn positive and it will turn positive within the hour. Warren is bullish and buying. At least two upgrades and higher price given this week. International pension funds such as from Norway, Denmark, Canada etc buying for their pension fund long term investment"
Time to close the market for the day. Nothing positive coming of this today.
"On Feb 26, AAPL hit a high of $124.85 then closed at $121.26...Change of $3.59On 5 Mar AAPL hit a low of $117.57 then rallied to $121.94...a change of 4.37Both days there was a pivot. Why? Rather obvious.Both days were option expiration Fridays. Both days were huge profits for the algorithm players.Need to go back to previous Fridays and look if there is a pattern here."
Cancel your sell orders people Buffett is loading up
"Yes keep averaging down, that’s really all you have at this point."
Today for sure it will hit 125 due to option calls ....next week easy 135 ...recovery will be fast as it will be pumped huge in premarket as per previous trends ....this is the best chance ever to make money ...get in now ..
Let me get this straight...iPhone mini production has been cut back because everyone is buying the more expensive iPone models and this has cause the stock to retreat??????
"At a meeting with Wall Street on March 4, 2021 chairman Powell said “we have lot of ground left to cover and good reason to be optimistic “. My God what else do you guys want to hear."
"I finally lost my confidence in market and Apple. Sold all my Apple shares, of course at a loss. However, I am confident I will be able to buy same no. of shares at a lower price in a few months so that will recover my loss. Apple is a good company but odds are not in its favour right now. Happy trading guys!"
Futures rising nicely and I smell money !Ahhhhhhhh !
Markets are gonna correct another 10 percent. Buy next week
ig weekend dow futures up 127... looks good for tomorrow for now.
Apple is really a pain of a stock to own..great earnings and billions in the bank...yet the stock can't hold a bid
I added more to my Apple holdings at 142 close to the all time high. It's yielding much more than the average bank/broker money market and I feel confident that it will more than keep up with inflation.
Good day today Apple!
"Look at the 1 year AAPL chart, and make a guess as to where we’re headed pretty soon. I see some good upside potential in our future! This is a great time to buy and hold I believe."
"AAPL will be up over 140 on Tuesday for no reason. It is to move towards 170 on strong earnings and upgrades, EV titanic project and soon opening economy"
"Only in America do you find people wearing $150 sneakers, drinking $5 cups of coffee, typing away on their $900 cell phone complaining on their social media accounts that they are oppressed and capitalism has failed them."
"Whoever bought six months ago, today is $2 in red. What a great long term investment."
It’s absolutely amazing. Without FOX news we might not ever know the real truth what’s going on.
better get the h-ll out while prices are elevated before bond yields spike again next week
$130 this week  percent Buffett will buy in at anytime it’s a strong hold
"AAPL’s one year chart is no worse than the two “meme” stocks of years past—AMZN and NFLX—in fact identical. But among those 3, AAPL is the best investment, with promising new technology in both short & long term, and a PE less than half the around 80 they enjoy"
calm down everyone. If you feel the need to sell that is fine. I am not sure that such a drastic measure is required. Sleepy Joe and his crew don't have a clue what they are doing. I think panic is the biggest enemy. and will only serve to enrich those playing this game
And why is apple selling off?
"sold apple every share at 120.67, bad news this morning about the Nikkei report cutting iPhone orders by 20%. I am 100% invested in game stop."
Welcome to another year of Apple stuck at a price of 120-125 range!
"Added more this week , they are called growth stocks for a reason . Apple is the definition of that & will continue to grow over time .it will out perform many of these so called value stocks that are benefiting from a temporary rotation in asset allocation."
Powell said “through” 2023....man that is stocks greatest news...absolutely awesome. 3 years!....nasdaq index will double
CUP AND HANDLE ON AAPL. buy buy..hedgies intention detected
Beginning of rotation back in to tech?
Now the analysts areSaying the growth to value rotation has peaked and will now see a move back to growth stocks and to reposition portfolios
Just started my life long AAPL hold 24 shares at $123 goal is 76 more shares within the year
Some heavy resistance $127 thru $131. After that high $130's. Fingers crossed.
Slightly annoyed by the EOD sell-off but then again I am happy to be able to buy more at discount. Thank you to whoever sold!
All I want is for this to stop closing RED.
We are Green in Germany both Apple and Tesla $125 here we come
So far the ig Dow futures are up 109 so futures look like they willOpen higher at 6pm
"Rumors are floating around the State of Michigan that WFH will become permanent for all Michigan state govt workers. If true, I'd imagine that's true for other states, too. Might be a good time to buy in on these ""stay at home"" tech stocks again that have fallen recently...."
"The 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 1.60% early this am, back near 13-month highs. Apparently investors think that’s better than the 1000% I’ve yielded with AAPL over 10yrs...maybe Russian Math?"
"At a market capitalization of 2 trillion dollars, Apple is valued higher than the ENTIRE ENERGY SECTOR. That is amazing"
On to $150 today
"Analyst EPS 5X next year. Apple Fi tech better than 5G, no WiFi required. Super long term stock"
"More trouble. Lawsuit verdict. $300 million. Just a long list of problems with Apple. Underperforming massively vs. markets, stock continues to fade. The LASTthing this stock needs is ANY bad news of any kind. I’ve been telling you since earnings...something isn’t right and obviously there are more selling than buying."
"Once AAPL hits us with the new iPhone, and innovative TV solutions, and a secure car deal, there should be no reason it doesn’t reach ATH within the next few years."
AAPL DOWN 20 DAYS IN A ROW. COOK RESIGN. 97% OF INVESTORS VOTE U OUT
Wow they really want you to sell don’t they? Not me not one share. It’s a trap
gas  is up food is up and now with the stimulus package inflation will go much higher. rates must go up
fed leaves rates unchanged. Apple rockets to green
Apple  will be $200 again! You just have to hold and wait. History won’t change for this company.
This 10 year yield excuse getting old!
Hope everyone took the “golden opportunity” to acquire more APPL when prices were down.
"Hi everyone, my prediction for the closing today was close but no cigar. I predicted + up to .80 and of course the .80 number was in the minus. But considering that 122.34 was the low and a comeback made I don’t feel too bad. 2 out of 3 days not bad. Only thing to add is hold APPLE and don’t panic on down days, we will be $145 by 6/30/21."
Longs just hold or buy more! Apple  will be $150 before the end of April
Stock isn't a bargain until it drops under 100....really closer to 90
I won't be whistling Dixie until we are back up to $145
The longs tout buying the dip but you've only had 276 dips since the split...When have you had enough dip?
The markets are up under B$den. People on this board need to give Apple time and quit their whining every time the stock drops. Think long term!
Next week the market is going to recover and AAPL stock will continue its normal rise. This stock isn't going to collapse like shorts want. It's not GME.
Apple and Tesla both very Green in Germany should run to $127-$128 today
"We don’t know where the stock will be in the next few days/weeks, but we all know where it’s going to be in the next few years (somewhere higher!). Stop speculating and start investing!"
Tomorrow is the start of a trend reversal. We wont be taking off to recent highs but i think the dreadful day in and day out selloff is over with. We just slowly and steadily climb to 140s again as it nears its earnings in late april. Big fish will slowly start to trickle in slowly adding to positions. You NEVER bet against FAANG
Whoever said this morning the value you trade has played out. I agree. 10 year treasury may have topped out. Let's make up 10 points this week!!!
watching apple on fridays is like taking a break from watching ice melt to watch paint dry.

"Ethan 1hours agoWhy SENS CGM is so revolutionary from DEXCOM user, EthanAs a Type 1 Diabetic this is an absolutely revolutionary piece of technology.Non-diabetics might not understand the full importance of something like this kind of technology. Managing our blood sugars is a full time job, that requires you to make decisions that will ultimately affect your life and well-being.There’s an estimated 422 million people with diabetes. Of those 422mil only 6% receive the proper care and are in range with their sugars. Sugars that are too high on a day to day basis have a significant compounding effect that leads to:- Pancreatic Cancer- Blindness- Loss of limbs- Heart attack and heart disease- StrokesCurrently, CGM’s are a luxury that few can afford because of the monthly costs to change their CGM every few weeks. With a long term implantable CGM this totally changes the game and makes it a lot more accessible to EVERYONE.Truly a remarkable company, product, and vision. If I had to guess I think it will be a DIRECT competitor to Dexcom and Abbots FreeStyle Libre.Enjoy the ride everyone this has tremendous room for growth. "
That was a good bull vs bear fight in the last minute with bulls fighting to keep it above 121 while bears pulling it below 121. To me closing at 121 feels good after weeks and weeks of succumbing to bear pressure. Next week I expect AAPL to test its next resistance level - the 124...

"Another day of big tech selloff. We are seeing a continuation of buyers looking at the cyclicals, oil and value stocks. Not that Apple Inc. is going under anytime soon–after all–they just released the greatest earnings report in the history of American capitalism. It's just that buyers are more interested in solid companies such as GameStop who have solid spreadsheets. Tech has become all too frothy in a world of 10y yields approaching 1.5 Even though Apple pays a decent dividend – the cautious investor is more comfortable rotating to bonds in this uncertain climate. Yes, main street USA is opening up– more and more people are being vaccinated. But the markets are not the economy–always looking forward to the next what if's and dystopian nightmares. Damn big tech. It's time to batten down the hatches for stormy seas ahead."

"The millennials need to raise cash in order to buy the airlines and cruise lines and hotels. Where do you think they are getting that money from. They're selling apple. Also, it's very unlikely apple's Q1 will be anything like their Q4...which had tons of tail winds. Think about how many people were buying apple products between holiday shopping and back to school shopping for their kids who are doing online learning. Normally back to school shopping is trips to the gap and jcrew and maybe a new backpack. Instead that money was spent on a new a sweat shirt (who needs to look good when zooming in) and devices for home schooling (iPads, MacBooks, etc). I'm long and welcome this pullback but just find it funny when so so many people can't figure out why the stock pulled back after a huge earnings. It's called buying the rumor and selling the news. Happens all the time. Stocks run up in anticipation of a big print and then pull back after the news. And this specific case...it's going to be hard for apple to match last quarter, further dampening the urgency to buy right now. Apple will still be higher at the end of the year though."

Not sure why people think this is a bargain at 120. I guess some just use the pull back from the highs as an indicator. If it was overvalued at 145 why say it is a bargain at 120-125. Stock is a bargain under 90.

"The market frontloaded the entire recover and then some into cyclicals, all before even the shadow of a recovery materialized, based on the assumption that recovery will be explosive and smooth. This can only end in tears. Herd immunity induced evolutionary pressure is a biological truth. It took 2 years to even begin recovery for the Spanish Flu. People were getting infected 3rd and 4th times due to mutant strains, which always come out when herd immunity is achieved due to said evolutionary pressure. This works for both naturally acquired and vaccine induced herd immunity. True normality only comes back after the virus adapts itself to the human population and becomes endemic, by becoming less deadly to their hosts.Many cyclical sectors like travel and brick and mortar retail are up to their eyeballs in debt, and interest rate is rising. AMC needs to charge $100 per movie ticket just to pay the debt they already took out at low interest rate. Most airlines need to charge quadruple price for tickets. If people go wild, mutant strains will spike and cause another lockdown. If people don't go wild, many cyclical industries will go under.What I don't understand is, why institutions seem to think rising interest rate means it's a good idea to move money from the likes of Apple and Tesla, who will never need to borrow a cent in the foreseeable future, into zombies like cruiselines and airlines, who are up to their eyeballs in debt, most of whom have no future."
"Thanks, Tim Cook and Apple. Just keep buying up all the shares you can as the stock price drops. Hold off on any new product announcements as long as possible. Don't make any mention of Apple's current performance to investors. Tesla is doing worse than Apple and that's good enough for me. If it takes Apple a couple of months to recover, I'll have a good chance to buy more shares with my stimulus check money. Will Apple actually reach as low as $110? That's fine by me. I'm confident Apple will recover all of its losses by the summer. Meanwhile, I can watch the number of outstanding shares drop as the EPS rises a couple of dollars. I suppose buybacks are good when Apple tanks. I won't be losing any sleep over it. Apple will have plenty of new products to announce later in the year."

I want to see millions of Apple's outstanding shares disappear over the coming months. If the stock goes down even further, so what? I'm sure this is what Apple wants and so does Warren Buffett. I'm sure most big investors aren't interested in Apple right now so small retail investors have a nice window of opportunity to buy Apple on the cheap without any worries. Apple is doing just terrific in product sales and Services. I'm not sure what's causing the overall market sell-off but it's not going to harm Apple one bit as Apple has money to burn. With all the Apple Stores open, sales may even improve as more people get to play with Apple products.So, don't worry about any Apple share price dip. Investors are probably just nervous over nothing special. I'm not concerned at all. I'm going to sit back, watch the panic-selling, and relax."

124 today
"You people need to relax. Apple makes big runs up and down. Before the 4 for 1 split, they were 42 point runs......up and down. Sometimes back to back. You can set your watch with these runs. Now they are 10 point runs. Apple has now gone from $140 to $120. That’s back to back down runs. Apple is in a buy zone now......but if somehow you get the extremely rare triple run......down to $110, then buy hand over fist and ride the 30 run that will follow. Apple is not hard if you follow the big runs. Apple makes big runs."
"Barrons March 6, 2021 article by Ed Lin ""A Giant pension Bought Apple, GE and Intel Stocks. Here is what it sold""."
Tim Cook announced a new share buyback program. Apple will buy 10 shares for every share shorted by Trade Guru. So far Tim has had to buy zero shares.

where is td101. will the small gains hold today into the close.
Hedge funds always try to leave the Apple hotel for a while to try and justify their existence to clients and platforms....but they always come back later in the year for the easy money
"A crowd of shorts stopped and stared, they didn't notice the light had changed... they blew their minds out..."
it's looking like the time to buy apple was 10 years ago.
April is usually very very good for AAPL share price using history as a guide.
"ICU the shorting troll, check out the stock price this morning. Hahahah, shorting trolls getting burnt. Apple long term!"
I TOLD YOU to buy and accumulate yesterday and last week. Expect AAPL 145 breakout earning date level . Classic Classic!!!. So expect 220 breakout in Q1. Trust in truth.

I see a big squeeze soon . buy buy. Correction will come like thieves at night. Buy now
Dont forget theyre still leaders in the cell phone industry. That alone is huge
$AAPL versus $VHC decade patent ligitation claimed $1.1 billion in treble and damages and was awarded around 50% of the claim... If we project this on our case that would be around $5 billion...
Don't despair Apple will continue the climb upward.See this as a buying opportunity add to your position Apple is a great company for many years to come.
Th US stock futures all green now.Sell at the open. Hopefully AAPL will open gap up
Most of them got this at 140 plus. But still feel comfortable buying AAPL shares. It should go past 200 very soon
"Bought back in December at $120, held and didn’t sell when it reached $145! Still holding and will hold for many many more years to come. APPL Strong "

"It’s all about follow thru. The last time Apple logged 2 up days in a row in a week was Feb. 1 & 2. Since then, every green day has been followed by red."
Apple will be back to $140 in March.
THE FED SAYS EVERYTHING IS OK WE ARE IN A RECOVERY ECONOMY AND MIONS PEOPLE'S KEEPING EVERY WEEK FILES FOR NEW UNEMPLOYMENT
I would like to thank the academy for allowing me to pick up those 1500 shares at 118 and change. I will use the extra 3k to contribute to the Festus society for the advancement of Gibson ES-335 guitars. Thank You.
Keep holding. Apple has made my portfolio bleed in the last trailing months. But I will keep holding.
"My prediction is that if an automobile manufacturer is not a general tech business (like Apple, Samsung etc), they will struggle to survive. VW and Ford have survived on the principle that most people in their key markets each own a car"
When your holding like mr buffet you really don’t care about the price right now. I’m holding at least past the next split
"All technology stocks are down; some of these technology companies were almost 100 to 200% up. However, AAPL stock is still under valued. This is initial reaction as other technology companies are down, investors are looking for safe heaven due to inflation is on the way. However, soon investors will realize the value of these growth companies and these stocks will boom, IMO AAPL will be $140byt the end of May, 2021. Slow and steady wins the race. I never seen apple jumped and fell like $10 dollars or more a day, but other tech companies do. Patience!"
"So I’m struggling and need advice!I’m 31 years old, and invest in Apple at $122 and need help on should I hold longggg or sell off and invest in something else long today!?? I see some analysts rate this as a Sell, which I never thought I’d see with a stock like Apple. I love Apple, just trying to think what is best for me and my family long term. Thank you!"
"If anyone with a half a brain doubted Wall Street is corrupt, then all you had to do was watch the action on AAPL today. OE Friday. They absolutely pinned this to 120 with no doubt in my mind. Actually the action on this stock pointed to this since Tuesday. Corruption at it's finest."
FED rally tomorrow and Friday and then trend higher through Spring and Summer
"Been in since 2016 when it was $23. It's just a great company and tech is the future, stay long . I just keep buying on the dips and building wealth. In 10 years you will be up 50-80%"

"Its going down in anticipation of what Jerome Powell is going to say. When he spoke 2 weeks ago, tech sold off for 2 days. Painful. Bank yields are at 1.68 right now, highest in 15 months. If he doesn’t signal that he will bring yields down, tell will sell off again. He didnt want to say that 2 weeks ago. Nothing has changed so i dont see why Jerome will say anything different."
I’m buying every single dip becouse 2024-2025 will be amazing year . If you don’t like go invest in Magic company’s with no products and no revenue . See you at 4 trillion apple cap
March 26th is rumored New Products announcement day
Up $0.60 in premarket...... AAPL is on a roll. Amazing how it can drop in $5 chunks and struggles back in $1 pieces...... very discouraging but keep the faith.....headed up to 175 this summer....200 by end of year. Best to turn off computer and just let apple do it's thing.
I'll be eating off the dollar menu tonight.
"I don't get it ? Sure the 10 year treasury is up again but why sell off AAPL 2.5%. The company will operate fine in any eviorment. Profit taking? Oh well, can we get back to the $130.-$140'S. Dead money 7 months!!"
It is assumed that these companies who have to rely on new innovations all the time need to borrow money to finance the research and development of these products. Rising interest rates make it more costly for these companies to do business.
Great News! Any American who wants a Vaccine can get one as of May 1st. America’s Back! Blue skies and Happy Days are here again!
I wnat to cry and laugh all at the same time. Here we go again...
"I'm doubling down on my Apple stock, if this is driven down to $99/share! This could be the last time Apple is less than $100 unless it does a split down the line again. I'm Long since 1997, but this is too good to pass up on buying more shares!"
thats how the market works now... 10 minute flash crash so they can cover their shorts and buy long positions and now we grind higher.
"127 is a major test point, we may retest it several times but once breaks through, we are heading straight to 131..."
AAPL Will hit $160 by summer. Just need to announce an EV partner.
Always amazed me how Market Timers can take a 100% proven longterm moneymaker and turn it into a short term casino....fascinating human behavior
"Call me an eternal optimist, I am feeling a turnaround tomorrow."
1 minute silence to those who sold their shares expecting a drop in last 2 minutes :-) :-)
"this wasn't about tech/10yr. bed bath and beyond got hit, restuarant stocks got hit, oil too... manufactured sell off across the board."
Apple is about to form a nice CUP if it reaches 128. The last rocket that caused it to go to 144 was from the forming of the CUP AND HANDLE. Can never go wrong WHEN BETTING ON THE CUP
Quadruple Witching day. Last hour could be interesting.
Whole market drop. AAPL still a deal.
Lagging. But better than a red day for sure. Woohoo!!
Stimulus passed overnight! $1400 each. Watch the iPhones fly off the shelf’s
Stimulus bill now passed and more jobs expected. Forecast markets will be good next week.

"I don’t care if you’re long term or wanting to make a quick buck. But with upgrades and price targets going up, it’s hard to believe this thing can’t go up 1-4% every once in a while. This is one of the big boys. I’m not expecting that everyday or every week. But once every 2 or 3 weeks a 2% or 3% close would be nice. Nada was up 3.30% today. Intc was up 3.06%. Bidu up 1.82%, avgo 1.77%. When’s the last time aapl’s been up 2% to close the day? And this wasn’t even a great day for the markets."
Once $OPTI announces a deal with $AAPL I see that alone taking Optec to over $5. With the PPE deal and another plus share buyback plus uplisting to NASDAQ. This is 100% worth over $10 in next couple years.
"Strong Sell, Fair Value $50. Buffet selling everyday if not every minute already."
"Fellows...if this were a real pump, we would not have seen the last minute dump and a sluggish after market. I bet this will start with either a penny positive pre market slowly turn to red by mid day end at 119s again...Until there is a significant news or press release, the shorties are going to have fun and the april call holders are going to be biting fingers and counting losses. I am not a naysayer but I really don't see any catalyst for this to reach 130s anytime soon..."
"There are at least three factors at work right now1. Rotation to Dow banks, oil and travel. Ie airlines cruise cos and everything discounted by the pandemic. 2. 10 yr note pressure3. momentum As always there will be an equilibrium. Technically Apple fallen into bear territory and will come back moving closer to earnings."
"As an APPLE Long I have to wonder why my 2117 shares of APPLE@103 avg actually goes down again when things are bullish and my OTC stocks like TSNP/HUMBL shares @0.15 avg are now $1.07 and bullish??I LOVE APPLE but APPLE always has such a positive forward pipeline but no matter how great APPLE tech is we shareholders never get the predicted KABOOMS. Too many shares and the expected sell the Apple news makes for bored rich Longs to search for the next APPLE stock .BUT APPLE LONGS know that “The next APPLE “ will likely be from APPLE.. Lesson learned years ago, NEVER DOUBT OR SHORT APPLE EVER. Eventually Apple always make the bears pay for their APPLE short mistake. Time again for Aapl short to pay back LONGS every dime plus a couple $$ interest. Come on APPLE burn the short interest the hate APPLE SURPRISES.GREEN APPLE MONDAYLONG APPLE LONG LIQUIDMETAL LQMT"
What would the catalyst be to move this higher? It’s pretty much fully valued right now. It may run up before next earnings but then maybe not
Watching Apple stock performance today be like...
EU investigating AAPL...ruh ro
"For all the aapl defenders, it closed over $142 a month ago. $21 decline in a month, hedge funds pumped it up, retail bought in, and now will be holding and holding. I own a few shares, and a $20K drop per 1000 shares is painful, I don't care how ya slice it. Now I know you only lose if you sell, and I am still way up from when I bought in 2014....yet making me regret not selling some at $140 plus. I do not see a bottom yet."
"Came from Amazon which was doing nothing. In with 16,000 shares of Apple at 128.87 yesterday. I think it looks good for me and was a great price to get in. Will wait until it gets to 140 and then cash out with a good gain. I think it will get there soon. What do you guys think?"

Let's think about this... the rotation into reopening will get people back out traveling.with the massive amount of traveling comes pictures video. ICloud becomes even more important. upgrades to cameras on the phone will cause more people to buy iPhones. it's still the best camera phone on the market. This will correct up by spring.

When Powell talks down bonds this week Big Tech/AAPL will get a massive bid. $130 real soon. This week.
Power hour. Let's do this.
"Buffet trimmed his AAPL holdings by 6% because it was too overweight in his portfolio. If you think this is a reason to panic and sell, you don't need investment lessons, you need a shrink. I'm buying, thank you."
Sell off is great for Apple buybacks. And Apple is buying for sure.
"Quite undervalued at current price, big boys loading up the cheap shares."
we always support the president of the united states' no matter whom. this one is just a figure Head any way. no worries. aapl has its own trouble.
"GME is not investing, it’s gambling. There is a mistrust among WSB members now because more people lost money following them. Because of that Hedge funds starting to look the lesser of the two evils now."

There is News that in Berlin VW will partner with Apple for EV 
"Mickey Mouse , if Apple goes to $80 I’m doubling my stake."
The recent selloff is people preparing for the largest tax hike in history. Investors are taking their gains before the increased capital gains taxes hit. The same thing happens every time a capital gains tax is enacted. The government makes money short term but loses long term.
shorts are getting fried again.
almost a 20% decline from the previous high even with the amazing earnings. if this is not a good buying opportunity then what is
Well ! Shorts are scared now even before the spike ...Expect a 10 - 15$ rally in couple of weeks ...you will loose everything if you think it’s going to 100$
Cleared for take off.
Nice way to start the week. My calls are starting to look healthy again.
I am thinking to sell all my shares at other tech stocks with losses and buy aapl at this low price and ride it up to 200
Strong economy over next year means strong Aapl! Hooray!
Most of wise investors want to have Apple in their portfolios for safety and grow. Can't believe someone wants to sell Apple at such low price.
"how great apple is,,maybe it is,,,but the stock is not the corporation,, so the price can go to $1 and still be called apple. 4 point drop since yesterday,,"
Who sold last week with weak hands? Chasing is no fun! That’s why you hold Apple 
Big dip buying here before next week's $1.9 Trillion which sends the stock market UP!!!!

"Stop insinuating that politics has anything to do with this selloff in AAPL, tech, and growth. Cruise and airline stocks have been rallying. Another case in point is a Dem Congress tried to put Keith Gill on the spot by asking if he was still long GME two weeks ago. Those who listened to his call have tripled since then"
"For those who follow Aapl very closely. When was the last time Aapl purchased a large chunk of their stock. If they did not take advantage of the recent pull back under 120 then there is a good reason. They will use their excess cash to purchase a ""specialist"" company that has the synergism to make the 2 parts greater than the whole. I would suggest Qcom, Swks, or Mp."
Apple's P/E is not too high. It is compared to the past...... but things have changed. America has been flooded with money. The government has been printing more greenbacks than ever before & it is not slowing down. There is more demand for securities and this pushes P/E levels higher. Get used to higher P/E levels for growth stocks.
Apple is goint to 100 and lower..there is a big bearish pattern !
Investors want to see innovation. They are too focused on the Apple car. The company shouldn’t have released that information until they had a prospective partnership. Not looking good at all...
we are hostage to bond yields for the foreseeable future. who knows when it will bottom. Viacom goes up every day regardless of the market conditions.
"All In Apple at this insanely cheap price, poised to go $200+ in a year."
"They have been warning not to buy Tech stocks for the last 30 years, even Buffett wouldn't buy in for 20 years. If your analyst says to sell AAPL tell him to go away."
"Let me share with you a story.I had found an old friend after 20 years. Eventually we discussed the stock market. I suggested AAPL but was more consumed in day's action...put/calls. etc.She did not understand and lost money. I finally said ""Just buy AAPL and hold it. Don;t worry you will make your money back. Split adjusted AAPL was $4- then"
The 1.9 Stimulus means at least +1000 points on nasdaq and Dow next week.You also have big oversold market.
Don’t t be disappointed longs! Apple  will probably soar today
"Now that big money have earned all they can from the options scam, and long interest has waned, it’s time to wash trade AAPL down to accumulate more shares for the inevitable run-up AAPL deserved from the last ER. It’s a chess game, and the rest of us are pawns"

"What's with the new product rumors and no new product dates? Mac Rumors originally quoted March 16 for new product announcements then March 23. Given that Apple announces these events at least two weeks in advance, what's going on?"
is Aapl likely going to dip today and pick up next week ? what's best price to buy this this week /next week .
"Interestingly, two types of polls here! One who believes that stimulus will be bullish for market and other group think that giving free money to public is not good for economy! Tomorrow will tell who is right.  or "
Big banks wants bigger share of your stimulus and rebounding economy by creating worries. Don’t let them win!!
Look at what happened in September. Much the same sell off and it recovered nicely. Relax. Apple is a strong profitable company with a bright future. That's why you bought aapl stock in the first place.
Is Tim awake?
Anyone selling Apple in exchange for that whopping 1.72 on the ten year ?
I've started adding a lot more at these prices. I love a sale!!
game over
On the bright side - Mac is coming with Face ID
"Remember, The Stimulus will pay for itself. Just like the Tax cuts."
AAPL will be in the positive at closing today. Starting next week it will move more like the Apple we know and Love.
"100% AAPL will break 130 today. AMZN is leading. Sentiment is huge. Pretty sure this game from smart money will give up very soon. EPS/revenues were huge in Q3, Q4. No reason this low but games from hedgies. Well, they will be punihsed very soon. Due to who cover first. They will fight like a dog who cover and buy..buy in advance and watch a movie. But you gotta buy more"
Let the march towards Q2 earnings commencement. Onwards & upwards!
The government needs your money to pay you the stimulus check
Time to PIVOT

Looking forward to another magnificent close like yesterday.
When futures open at 6:00 pm eastern time my predictions are that the Dow will open at +200 points and Nasdaq at +85 points
"APPL flying high again, not only the Apple products doing well but think about Apple car and how well that will be welcomed"
"I don't understand, why do the people expect that investing in stock means becoming millionaire in a month. Need patience; stocks go up n down and it is normal business. If you don't have patience, better to invest in mutual funds, no worries but you don't get return even equal to annul inflation."
"Over reaction to the 10 year bond rate, even at 1.5% interest, how many people will buy bond instead of stock? SP500 P/E is well of 3%."
You just witnessed how the cards are completely stacked against the small investor and day traders. Incredible manipulation by funds end of month options expiration on all nasdq stocks rendering all calls worthless.
Phew. Hope we close green. Close call.
130 today boys
"Road to $100 or below another step closer, Inflated bubble is busting !"
"Message to all the weak hands! APPL is totally manipulated by the big boys, so keep selling your shares and letting the Hedge Funds and shorts scoop them up! That's a real smart thing to do! Yeap, they are taking all the profit you were going make if you just held it for another 30 days! Sorry you miss out. But you can always buy back in at $150.. Cheer's Longs~!"
I am not buying into the fear of an impending market crash that the press is pushing so hard for the hedge funds. The MMs are so desperate but this market can not be moved as easily as it once was. There are so many new investors entering the market each day especially since the pandemic. I see so many young people now interested in investing and starting positions. Make fun of the robinhooders all yall want but they are strength in numbers.
"If you’re all so sure the world is going to burn and AAPL is a bust, why aren’t you bragging about the money you’re going to make off your short positions?"
Well I got almost 550 dollars toward my new Reckenbacker. Thanks shorts
Red or green?
"One step forward, two steps back."
"Road to $60 Begins, Bubble Busting !"
"Apple has reportedly begun talking to suppliers of lidar self-driving car sensors, as part of its effort to build an electric vehicle, according to Bloomberg. Common on many self-driving vehicles and prototypes, lidar sensors are used to determine the vehicle's distance from objects, people, and other vehicles. The technology also is used for other tech, including a few iPhone models. Apple was talking with several lidar suppliers working on next-gen hardware, according to Bloomberg. The report also said Apple has developed in-house much of the software needed for self-driving vehicles. But a vehicle launch may be at least five years away, Bloomberg reported, citing internal Apple sources. In recent weeks and months, reports have also claimed Apple was in talks with several car manufacturers about building Apple-branded vehicles."
"Honestly Tim Cook truly does need to add innovation to the mix. I'm a long-term holder for apple, but through the recent years I just see the same equipment with different ports, which quite frankly #$%$ off customers from my experience, the main reason they buy Apple's phones is for simplicity and aesthetics. I keep holding because I do have faith that they'll prosper beyond what they have now."
Kathy Woods said on dip she is picking up tech stocks -an opportunity to buy lower.

Why is anyone in their right mind selling aapl for these lows when they all know it going to be the corone up when the market goes higher. The market does what it does. It’s how we react that make or breaks us

"A lot has been discussed about the Da Vinci Strategy but let's talk about the Van Gough one .AAPL is down 10% from the intra day all time high of $145+.IF you want to buy it now at another 10% discount, sell a Jan 22 put for $20+.One of two outcomes: you must buy AAPL at $130 sometime between now and third week of Jan 22 or you keep the tax deferred cash"
"Chase those hot stocks....you will lose long term. And in 5 years, you’ll wonder why you didn’t do the simple an obvious by buying and holding Apple."

You just know the Fed will rain on the parade tomorrow.
"bought at 117.09, several days ago and sold at 127.11 this morning. I thought 2 analyst upgrades today, would surpass the 128.56 high from 2 weeks ago."
Selling is not going to stop. It's too expensive now. I see no reason to jump here. 81 is my price on this.
Be careful rushing back in today. You may be catching a falling knife. Today kicks of 3 days of important treasury auctions and if they go poorly yields will rocket and hurt the market

Longs don’t watch the ticker! Weeks like these happen. You hold and the next thing you know Apple  will be $150. It’s coming before summer
Is this a good place to enter AAPL? It has broke below the 50 SMA. Never have owned it. Why is it selling off when other tech stocks and market in general is near its high. Are we about to see a big correction? Any thoughts appreciated.

Wedbush’s Dan Ives has upped the ante: he believes Apple stock could rise 86% in the foreseeable future. That means the stock price will be around $224 within 12 months!!! Interesting ...
"From Apple 3.0Apple dominates WearablesApple led the market once again with 36.2% share of 4Q20 shipments. Its Watch shipments rose 45.6% thanks to the appeal of three models with different price points (Series 6, Watch SE, Series 3). Hearables shipments also surged during the quarter although year-over-year growth slowed to 22%, down from 28% and 29% in the previous two quarters."
im kinda hoping i can pick up apple in th 117-119 range
Who is really running this country?? Seriously! Sleepy doesn’t know where he is
Wow Apple been in decline for two months since earnings and rotation out of tech now the excuse is 10yr rates holding down tech. I think twoMore weeks of this until earnings season kicks in in April. Apple will start to run up into earnings and be back in mid 130s by mid April
I added 15% more of my AAPL holding today bc the news they over took Samsung in the 4th qtr to be #1 phone seller is a big tucken deal
"I bought back in November at $122/share, and didn’t panic sell or take profits at $145 area, or freak out when it dropped below $120 last week. This stock will change our life by the time I sell our families shares! APPL Strong   #Buy&Hold"
Where oh where should someone put their money for the next 4 years is the big question.
"no end to this downfall, this wouldn't be happening if borrowing shares was illegal"
"Palantir owns the future of data analytics and beyond. We only get to see what they show us. What other disruptive and ground-breaking initiatives are in the works? Palantir is like $CRWD $AMZN $GOOGL $AAPL $FB $CRM $FSLR ...buy it, put it in a drawer, then open it in 5 years. You're welcome."
"Apple has transitioned from a product driven company to a provider of both products and recurring high margin services, with the latter accounting for a third of profits. Apple’s large and growing installed base is supportive for continued growth in services as more digital offerings are added and higher attach rates to its wearables."
$5.00 off yesterdays high unreal. My DKNG is up!!!
#AMC - No one can beat the atmosphere that AMC provides. Looking forward to the weekends for the latest films with your friends was a awesome experience and one that will never change. AMC will continue for many generations to come. $TSLA $NIO $AAPL $CCIV $GME $NIO
This is not a big deal. Shake out the weak hands so the longs can buy. Wish I had more cash.
At least $125 by end of week.
"Students returning to school, Apple reopens National wide, Apple might go $200 by end of the year."
Come on .10 more cents. High of the day!!!!!! What??????
Apple is up 4.91% to 127.21
My largest stake is in AAPL but CHPT & WKHS is Future unfolding and both have massive potential !
Market will rise today. Right now it has the jitters due to the weekly jobless report coming out within an hour or so and Powell will wrap up His upbeat presentation from yesterday
Disgusted with how the hedge funds have jerked tech stocks lower to get the pricing they wanted. Such a rigged system.
Never Sell Apple
China is going to eat our lunch and dinner
"You can purchase a iPhone with your stimulus check and have some cash left over.HD has been moving up...I suspect there are many home improvement projects that can be done for $1400. Walmart, which has been floundering, finally gets some upward momentum after the passage of the package."
Apple is outperforming all other FAANG today - still way oversold. Resistance at 130.
"Apple is not Big Tech like everyone makes it believe there are not like a FB, Twitter, they actually has physical technology like computers, phones, watches that provide a monthly subscriber as if it was a gym on your watch. Also, they are getting into the car business soon. Apple is trying to be a house hold brand and within business, school they are changing their computer system more and more to Apple product. My niece goes to a private school and the school is requesting the students to bring their own iPad to school."
"Apple is a great company, but I think it has alots of shares. I am all up to buy back, the less share we have the higher stock price."
"March 2021 quarter is a boom for the market specially the technology sector. About $350 to $650 billions will go into the market as a long term investment. Some of could have already happened or beginning to him . Of the stimulus going to individuals at $1,400 per person a study was done wherein it shows close to 50% being invested in the market for long term investments and appreciation in value. Everything is easy and simple to understand (1) a great quarter and great 2021 for the economy specially the technology sector and (2) and a great inflow of money availing of a great investment opportunities (3) a great buying of Apple stocks by the likes of Warren Buffett and Norway, Denmark and Canadian Funds an ample proof that they have great faith in our markets and economy"
"The market absurdly associated AAPL with TSLA today...due to their parallel stock split. Once this misguidance gets resolved, AAPL corrects back up"
Go read the warren buffet letter to shareholders he posted this morning. He explains his Apple position the sale of a small portion of the stock and that his stakeHas actually increased in size even with the small sale. They still own 907 million shares or a 5.4% of Apple. This is good news and with the stimulus it should continue the move upward
"It's ""Bet more"" season"
I’m part of The Blue Wave all the way but I agree with Republicans that the next round of Stimulus should be Targeted to those that need it the most !80k per couple or less40k per single 60k head of household Nobody above that is starving ?The money we save would allow us to double or triple the stimulus for those around the poverty line or below but I think the stimulus should be divided by 12 and paid out monthly ?Food & Bills not TV’s & Vacations ?
Thank you Buffett he just gave this stock a huge boost $130 plus here we come 
I am a happy bag holder
"From zerohedge:Jeff Pu, a veteran smartphone analyst with GF Securities, told Nikkei that Apple's CEO Tim Cook ""misjudged demand for both the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12 mini."" ""Consumers won't have that very strong feeling about the differences between core processors and about 5G wireless communication performance immediately, but they can immediately see the difference in screen size,"" Pu said. ""If it's around the same price, many consumers would rather just pick the older iPhone 11, which has a larger screen, as they don't yet expect much from 5G.""====================Bankruptcy in three years?"
So many bears posting on tech when 90% of the overvaluation is in $tsla $zm and about a dozen others not companies like $aapl $qqq
All Apple  stores open. Stimulus money going to new phones! People just have to have it! I call them mr & mrs jones. Love it
Just humbly hope tmr we don’t need to tank again after another fed speech...
Always buy at 122!
"We know the fundamentals are fantastic. On the technical side, we've tested the $123 breakout point which is another good sign. Confirmation of the big money moving in to push the stock higher happens at about $126."
Wellstrade 120k $120 puts decaying as I type.
tesla and apple shareholders. one and the same delusionals. too bad some of you might be conflicted as you guys might own one or the other and dont know what to make of the whole situation$aapl
AAPL is a lifetime holder. Do people think they will stop generating revenue or making new products?
"All sarcasm aside, you’d be wise to buy a little Tesla, and wiser if you buy truckloads of apple here. This is simply the best stock in the markets. Hands down. There’s a reason why 40% of the greatest VALUE investor in history’s portfolio is Apple."
Bought more shares Friday. Looking forward to the dividend raise in May and continued buybacks. We'll see who laughs last in about 10 years from now. Own it don't trade it.
"$1000 Iphone. No Thank You. I got my Galaxy for free when I signed up for Metro PCs., 3 years ago. Ok, Iphone has a better camera. However, I can text, email, play texas hold-em, tune my guitar and pretty much everything else I want to do. I've had Iphones and they all ended up the same. Poor performance, randomly turning off, batteries drain quickly and eventually the display starts to look like a piece of fruit striped gum."
Turning around nicely. Meanwhile Warren Buffett etc are increasing their holdings. Warren is the smartest Investor in the world and so are people from Fidelity investments etc. These smart investors are definitely increasing their positions as more and more people start 401k and 403b plans . Fidelity accounts have increased by 19% because the greatest people on earth know that they cannot only depend on social security to maintain a standard of living which they would like to enjoy in their retirement years. Great people we Americans are!
"Last year, AAPL dipped from $82 to $51 to now at $130-Year before there was also a dip as well s the year before.It happens but in the long run it hits new highs"
I am putting all my money into bonds. That should do the job.
"Don't be fooled, Tech is not going to crash...Airlines are going to crash, oil is going to crash, office space is going to crash, tech is not going to crash. Everything we do is tech"
"When people finally wake up to what the media is doing to them they will be upset. Politics, financial reporting, now even the weather is slanted by the media, all in the name of $$$."
Bought last week when this was hammered! Name another company with a better balance sheet! Love the fact that there are so many shorts here! This will explode higher on any given day! Grease up shorty!
Money is all over the place. Eventually it will rotate back to Apple  when new things are announced.
Seems like a lot of people here have AAPL as their sole investment. They are waiting for a big rise in share price and are getting frustrated.
So I guess we will go red today. Not up much at all in the pre-market. Everyone keeps chasing those airlines lol
As I told you all yesterday $135 end of the week 
"Should gradually move toward Green, People are loading up while Apple is vastly undervalued."
Just bought another 5 shares today. I know it is not much but it is all that I can afford right now. I will buy more in the future once I gather more cash! My goal is to own 100 shares. I’m just 70 away from it!
Apple bites back! As my Granny Smith would say when she was living in Fuji. It’s all delicious amigos and a big gala. Hehe 
Where have all the  gone??
Love that APPLE!
when they announce the car. this will be over $200
"Honest to God feel sorry for those who sold. I think $200 is on our way as soon as July 1, 2021. For the people who sold please get right back in because it will get better and better and it will go higher and higher. Meanwhile I have been buying more and also mutual funds with Apple and or Nvidia as a major holding. The decision is yours not mine though."
Apple car.
okay this is how Apple can make it to a 3 trillion dollar valuation. first and foremost all they have to do is announce that they will do their part tol fill the chip shortage by announcing a new manufacturing facility or plant or buy a manufacturer or merge with someone like a m a t. number two come up with a new product that no one was thinking about ie icar or battery technology aquire quantumScape etc etc.
It’s funny how shorts are saying that Apple longs are losing money. The only Apple “longs” that are losing money are the ones who bought in the last 6 months. I wouldn’t consider them Longs.
4. MOre 5 dollar days and we will be in business. Nice
The only bubble I see is in my champagne glass￼
The only way out for APPLE is buy tons of BITCOIN to cover up their bad earnings for next qtr.
Thinking about unloading my shares and moving into a different sector. Tech seems to be out of favor right now. Thoughts ? Have been a long term investor here.
"I added more to my TD Ameritrade account. When I opened back in 2004, with two shares of APPL, it it was called Scottrade."
Will be up 20% Monday on news of automotive deal Nissan
"YES, AAPL UP 10-12 TOMORROW ON WEAK DOLLAR, NO COMPETITION PRODUCTS IN 2021, OPENING ECONOMY, STIMULUS CHECK AND KIA EV NEWS"
Never believe past performance is indicative of future performance. 7 months of zip while missing out on Dow runs is not good.
How much do you guys think will one apple stock be worth at the end of the year
"If it goes to $35 JIM, I will sell my car and my Jordan collection. And buy more."
This board is sounding like the GME board more and more every day. Not really any useful comments. Hope it gets better comments.
Buffett will buy in after hours or premarket between today and Wednesday Strong buy and hold  $130 here we come
let's hope that Apple will address the chip shortage and do wonders for the American high technology market
A lot of upside to this stock. Dan Ives price target is 190ish....just collect the dividend and let apple do its thing.
124 tomorrow
We might go $128 tomorrow.
"The fed needs to open their eyes.Gas is 4.20 a gallone here, food has gone up about 15%.Taxes are up.I have no idea where they get their information. We are headed for a big reset soon."
SELL SELL SELL may see $115 today. $110 within a few weeks
Huge hedge fund buying in right now stop selling you can see the pattern they are picking up shares cheap cancel your sell orders
AAPL wants to breakout. And it will.
Buy at $120 today. Sell at $180 in six months.
"buy it, hold it and let's reach 140 $ in 2 weeks , 150 $ in 2 months "
"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has cut its planned production of the iPhone 12 mini for the first half of 2021 by more than 70% due to lower than expected demand, Nikkei Asia reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter."
"Josh Brown said it best, just when you think you have figured it out, the market changes the locks!"
Extremely likely to go Below $110 in a week. Outlook turning very Bearish.
told you the fed was talk the same story and market will go up. the Down will go to 35.000 trust me the fed will not raise rates and will keep print the Benjamin. it's sad but this's the market now is nothing will stop this market it's communist market control from the federal reserve
"MILENIALS are buying and squeeze out institutions this week. SHORT SQUEEZE will come this week. I am buying more before millennials do. I hope I received my stimulus of 7 dependents tonight so I can wire to my brokerage before millennials pull the trigger. ESP/revenues Q3, Q4 results will correct this week"
Oil at 60 is stimulus to 1 billion people who are the most impoverished on the planet. Their governments depend on oil for government revenue. Oil needs to maintain higher prices to give oil dependent countries money and a chance to diversify their economies. The difference is an American will pay a couple more dollars at the pump and emerging markets family can have a roof and food on the table with hope for a future.
"Upgrade from Morgan Stanley today, but its a waste in this market!"
"Car news will come in the next few weeks, sending the stock into orbit. Load up and enjoy the liftoff."
Good luck to all!
"Problem isn't Apple, there are huge structural issues in the economy. Apple is control, IP and marketing"
Keep dreaming about Apple moving up. Best days are over for this stock price.
If market hold buys enter toward end driving the stock to $123
Back to $117-118 again. This will be in a trading range for.a while. But no worries it’s a long term hold.
Mr Powell has said over and over he wants some inflation until we reach full employment. If you are waiting for him to say the FED will increase bond purchases to bring the yields down you will be disappointed
"So what appears to be happening is a reset of investor expectation. After all, it is investor expectation that determine stock prices. However, as an investor in Apple, to continue receiving inflated stimulus returns, you must accept the stock is not worth more than $70. So, a sell off happens in the attempt to bring the price down. The owner of the stock fights back and agrees to accept a lower return. The mere acceptance of that lower return in turn sends the value of the stock up again. S, be careful, probably no $150s coming soon, but most likely a mix of previous expectation and where we are today. Those with stocks at a previous high should get some capital gain relief. I anyone wants the calculations on value vs expectation I will provide. I comes back to the capital asset pricing model and the cash valuation"
"What a gift this was this morning!!!!! Wow thank u for the pullback, finally took a position in this!!!"
"I believe Apple has a great future for years to come but so do other tech companies. However, Apple can't just sit back and relax or there will be hungrier companies willing to do anything and everything to take Apple down. I have no idea how long Apple will have the highest market cap and maybe that doesn't really matter. I just want Apple to stay relevant as a tech and consumer company for at least the next ten years. It doesn't have to be the best company in the world to satisfy me as a shareholder. I've made more money from owning Apple since 2004 than I ever imagined was possible. No regrets at all.I simply can't rule out the possibility of another company becoming a wealthier company than Apple because times change and companies can't always change with the times. Only time will tell. I'm not giving up on Apple by any means. Companies like IBM, Xerox, HP, Texas Instruments, Cisco, etc. fell by the wayside as great as they were. Apple has outlasted them, so far. It's just that time can be a killer for any company. Apple will have decent share gains later this year. I have no doubts about that. Patience is all that's needed."
AAPL is the “go to” device by all age groups.
"Every drop makes a ocean. When you combine $1,400 per person it becomes a potent force (force multiplier/ force volocity). Unemployment will go down. GDP will rise. Demand will increase and more jobs will be created. You don’t have to be sir Albert Einstein to understand that. For example when you buy retail, wholesale goes up, manufacturer goes up and inventory begins to move. If you just started working (my former boss did) you can put a down payment for a car, a computer, buy an I-Phone etc and etc and etc and etc"
Today's trade on March 12 options is a short term trade today
"As a retiree and with confidence in holding long, my wife and I are looking forward to a continued growth of AAPL and have comfortably rode the recent down swing with confidence that the upturn of APPLE is about to emerge. So hold on long and enjoy your profits. Good luck to all. "
"Money from Boeing, Tesla and Bitcoin coming to Apple  Today!"

"Patience is a virtue, Apple is the best company. Shareholder for 15 years. Long and strong"
"Massive inflows into the Nasdaq and technology is happening now. Why would somebody invest in oil or gold . Every time I invested in gold and oil I lost. Even in financial and banking I lost. And guess where do the banking and financial institutions invest in? Sure they do home financing, advances for new businesses and start ups and auto loans and tuitions etc etc but the bulk of it is invested in the technology sector and the Nasdaq and the S&P. Do not follow the wind . Some great news for Apple besides upgrades and Warren Buffett buying there was news about Norway, Denmark and Ontario (Canada) Funds buying Apple etc in recent times."
"Yep! Now at an 11% drop after fantastic earnings. I've said it before, fundamentals don't mean a thing anymore. The market is driven by emotion, and hedge funds."
"Get out of AAPL! I moved all AAPL shares (owned since 2009) to Tesla last year and never look back. Apple is a value stock now, like IBM kinda value. Tim cook will be fired soon but that would not save Apple. It's too late"
We can thank Buffet’s comment. Apple = His Family Jewel. 
Do you guys know any good long term growth stocks like 30-40% return each year Apple is definitely one of them
"Expecting a bounce from $121 level, but resistance ahead.See Chart for levels.https://twitter.com/StockScreenerHQ/status/1371425656576356352"
Would not be surprised to see 125 today based on call/put ratio!
"For younger investors think of how they choose to invest when they see how this market has behaved since the first GME pop. Brokerages and the SEC handed shorts the whole thing on a silver platter at the expense of retail and now are actively hunting retail conversations on social media to stop any squeeze, endlessly printing money. Meanwhile bitcoin explodes and ALTs makes people millionaires without having banks as a middle man. it's a no brainer."
Great BUYING opportunity!! will be at least $160 or higher in a few months and $200 end of year or higher
2 things are happening here imo. The market is long overdue for a pullback. So we have one. The other thing is fear of inflation. Powell wants inflation to run as job growth gains strength. The market hates inflation. Time will tell how much inflation we really get
"Buy this dip in Apple, Microsoft and these other tech stocks before they’re out of reach, says analyst"
Apple should have bought Netflix and Tesla many years ago but they are arrogant and always want to do things their own way. They are finding out that this is not always the best way.Microsoft found this out years ago when they thought they could use their money to push out Google and dominate internet search. Not so easy.
the next conference call can't be that far away a month or so. if Apple addresses the chip shortage if Apple addresses the solid state battery industry if Apple addresses the new icar possibility if Apple addresses the next iPhone what's this go to 3 trillion dollar capitalization
"The largest company in the world posted the largest profits in the world,The shares tanked. That is all you need to know about AAPL, the stock market, and the future of America.I am glad it is happening. Lemmings don't deserve to win."
140 by end of next week. Let's do this!
Even if AAPL is down .80 today still for the week we are up 6.00. So on 1.000 shares you are up 6K. Stop complaining just hold long and average out a hefty profit. APPLE will NOT disappoint.
So what is the open price tomorrow now that the futures are up and climbing. I say up 3 bucks
Tomorrow opening will be $125+
Expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 36.3%.
I bought into a few AAPL dips several years ago and all I have to show for it is money.
"oh ye of little faith! aapl is a long term play... not a short term day-trading stock. the 1-, 3-, 6-month charts are all screaming buy. but if you don't have a long enough time horizon to let this grow you shouldn't be buying it in the first place."
"almost three (3) open trends of three printed today: Close at $121+, Intra day low of $118+, Intra day high of $121+.( it was $122.00. Almost $121.99)Now there are three open trends of three above $125+ yet to be printed"
What happened to oil? They find some on Mars or something.
"When most of the posts on here are complaining about the share price, and saying how bad AAPL is, that’s when I know it’s BUY time!"
The media is really bad mouthing AAPL as funds are loading up. These guys must meet at a bar to decide...who writes smack and who writes promos. What a joke the media has become.
AAPL started the year at 132. Down 12 bucks on the year.
"The buying of apple products, since they are the absolute best in class, is coming very soon with all of that stimulus money going into everyone’s bank accounts. Apple is the awesome! I am very bullish in the near term. You too will see it soon. Ask the Motley Fool!"
"apple stock is basically a money market account essentially now. investors sell their apple shares just to buy other stocks. before the split, people wouldn't sell apple."
"Very unpredictable, but holding long 5-10 years! I know it will hit $400 plus by then"
"hey now, look at that"
I should have sold all my shares when this touched 145 :/ I wanted to but after such a great quarter - I felt it would actually go up to at least 150 :( now I feel like a bag holder who’s lost 20% on apple already. I can’t even tell my wife about this :/
"I'm rounding up my meagre 163 shares to 200 shares, tomorrow."
GE is about to sell their aircraft servicing division for over $30 Billion. Apple needs to get in there and buy GE before Elon Musk does.
"No lie. This morning, CNBC was declaring that tech stocks would sink even further.now (the same day) CNBC is declaring that tech stocks are a buy."
Last week still mystifies me?The guests arrived on Monday then left early - Tuesday.The band played to an empty dance floor on Friday.No worries!If AAPL will be AAPL; WE will see $130's sooner than later
"Look at the historical prices.WE, gladiators, tried muscling the stock to delight of the coliseum crowd but it did not work. Last night I watched ""Gladiator"" Sorry.Shorts tried nose diving the stock repeatedly but $126 held four times (?) only to return t the new ground zero, $135.This action is not uncommon for AAPL. Anyone who stayed long since WE first came here in 2008 is up from $4 ( split adjusted) price"
"I like how all the AAPL shorts get all excited when this goes down 1/2 a percent. Ha. You do know stocks go up and down all the time right? It's Apple. I'm not worried at all. One of the safest investments. I bought at $142, and doubled my position at $136. It it goes down more, I buy more. Simple."
Apple keeps declining while FB keeps increasing. Both with similar PE ratios. Both highly profitable companies. Where will both be in 30 days?
"Apple has always proven Doubters wrong for years, Future is only brighter with Apple getting into new market like AI & Apple Cars. The Apple Brand itself is the world's most valuable assets."
I’ll just keep buying more at this price
After fed speaks this will probably soar from 3pm to close.
Should I still buy now and hold for 30 years until it goes to 130?
End of the year we will look back and say $144 was a good buy price and $127 was a steal!
Cuomo has accepted Joe's offer as Secretary of Groping.
I just added so much to my position today. Just added another 41 shares... My total amount invested in apple is now over $9k...

What do you guys think is going to happen to Apple stock when $2 trillion gets flushed into the market? As well as a potential car deal to be soon announced. ￼
Good time to start buying AAPL again.
If this stock doesn't close green I will jump out my window. (I live in a one story house)
"Buy while not late, Apple will flying up, new products and earnings !"
If you are having doubts about this stock. Look at Apple’s 1 year chart.
is it 2024 yet
One question. Will AAPL be a $200 stock by March 2025? I’m raising my hand.By averaging in a new position under $125 that’s a 15%+ annual return. As an older INVESTOR this looks quite promising for ten to twenty percent of a retirement portfolio. A major regret was not holding Apple over the years. Live and learn.
It’s easy for the government to say we don’t have inflation if they leave out the price of food and energy. Flooding the country with trillions of dollars of fake money will cause inflation every time
get ready for it!
All apple us stores are open as of today for the first time since March 2020!
"Cook: we're proud of our record as one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In the last four quarters dividends total over $14 billion, and since we reinitiated the dividend in August of 2012, our dividend per share has more than doubled. We think that's a strong statement about our commitment to growing shareholder income over time, and we plan for annual dividend increases, but we don't think that dividends are the only way that we can create value for shareholders."
no did miss the 500 point rally my energy stocks are doing just fine.
"Patience, they are setting people up to get frustrated and sell cheap shares. This is what they do. Make a story how tech is falling out of favor etc etc etc....bunch of bs!! Just hold and go to sleep for 3-6mths and wake up the stock will be $150"
"Now, Let's talk about this Friday.The last two Friday's have shown a pattern the last few hours of the day.AAPL was up for the week, it dipped $3+ the last ten minutes of the dayAAPL was down it rallied."
Lol luv it Apple 3.0....”Sale Ends Soon!”

I want my apples at the 3 year 200 sma line which puts this at $72.60. Thank you very much. I hope the treasury yield sky rockets
Apple needs to keep going down. It’s overvalued. Everything is overvalued. Excited to make money in this market crash
Questions on options?The rule of thumb but not law is to sell 50% of your trade after it is up 100%. A is closing out sale of puts after it has fallen 50%THis way you have a free ride after recovering your principle.
Buy’em back Luca!...won’t be this cheap for long...buyback a ton.
"COOK, BE LIKE MUSK, HE KNOWS HOW TO CAPITALIZE EXTREMELY BIG ON THE RALLY WITH MORE GOOD NEWS. AAPL SHOULD BE AT 155 NOW,"
"Cathie wood sold over 160,000 apple shares this week"
I bought Apple for 104 and am adding on bad days . Nobody should worry about this stock just sit back and watch it grow.
The border states are now swamped with illegals. Caravans from Central America and Mexico are forming.Thank JB for a job well done.
Apple will also invest in some great startups and mature and highly profitable companies this year.
Hey wait a minute ........ the short sellers swore Apple was doomed lol
Has anyone bought the new MacBook Air with the M-1 chip? Not with the intel chip! I have a 2012 that needs upgrade to new one
Tech is literally the present and future. The fact that people are selling off for more “value” stocks doesn’t make sense.
"Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If you day trade stocks you get no values and your trading strategy will fail eventuraly. If you buy cheap stocks and you get no values either, the longer you hold the risker it will be. But, for a great business like Apple, the longer you hold, the more value it will generate. Eventually, the price reflects the intrinsic value and makes you rich."
Tim Cook said that they have plans to increase the Dividend

Lucid Partnering with Apple for Apple Car this news is taking us to $140 like it did last time 
"Don't panic!When a broad index like the Nasdaq falls day after day even when other markets are rising, it can make you question your investing philosophy. But don't let short-term fluctuations change your attitude toward the entire stock market. No matter what happens in the short run, Nasdaq stocks will be back, and great companies will lead the way forward."
AAPL Jan 21 2022 122.5 Call - My option has been up nicely imply that AAPL will rise from here.
The Dow is up 17% since Joe’s election. Just sayin
"there is something wrong with apple stock, it can not hold a bid at all, so what is known that has not been announced to the general public because the stock has acted bad,,"
Down $20.00+ dollars since earnings. Wow super impressed.
apple won't go past 128.56 this week. expect a pullback to 122.67
"People have been telling me AAPL is done ever since I bought my first shares at $3.08 in 2007. I'm glad I never sold, and glad I've added along the way."
Petaluma CA becomes first city in America to ban new gas stations only electric allowed...and so it begins
"I see a lot of comments that demonstrate a lack of understanding of the company, its long term performance and its forward earnings and its leadership. I bought years ago at $9. I sold some about 10 years ago because I was over weight. Stock splits do not make prices rise but they are a strong indication of a company that has done well and expects to continue doing so. The lull is merely profit taking and a nervous reaction to the Reddit gang. It is ok to buy and best to hold. Sell if you are out of balance or need cash but this stock is slightly under valued presently and will do well in the medium term as it normally does. There is no negative news. There is only speculation on how to value the automotive move, if it happens. Cook is a creative steady hand. I am again overweight on the stock but am comfortable with that. Enough with the lemons, coiled springs, etc. You sound like cheer leaders or uniformed goofs. Do some research and use logic not emotion. There, got that off my back!"
Buying Opportunity!
$131 by EOD
"Apple shares are punch bag for Dow.. Anytime they want to drive the markets down, they sell Apple shares.. For market moves up, they buy other Dow components.."
"I am a tremendous cheerleader for apple in the last 34 years. they need to surprise the markets. I also feel we need desperately the reddit chat rooms to focus on the stock, to move it forward."
"I have a base of 11,000 shares. So I buy and sell 500 shares to make pocket cash. Bought in again with 500 shares. I want a Gibson Les Paul. Easy money"
Apple. Greatest American company ever. Like standard oil on steroids.
looking good already
hopefully you guys got into apple because it's on its way to $140
"APPL and other growth stocks are getting crushed due to rising int rates. But 10-yr bond ylds are just back to where they were pre-covid; real rates are at their lowest levels since 2013. IMO, the rotation to value is nearing its end, and this week’s growth puke is the finale. Looking forward to the bounce"
Great now a grind back to what it was 3 hours ago. Good stuff. Maybe tomorrow it can just drop back to below $120 I mean why not?
I still believe AAPL will hit 175 this year. Amazon is red on the year also not just AAPL.
"AAPL share price is being MANIPULATED by the MMs & Option sellers, every week !"
At the end of this presidents term this country is going to look like ￼ Venezuela.
$126 tomorrow
theres about 5 stocks in the whole market that are red today ... Apple is one of them
Steve Jobs just sold half his shares
The bottom is here. If you are not buying AAPL now you will lose out on this huge opportunity. Reddit should get in on this one. Many younger investors could make a fortune. Apple will hit $200 before the end of the year.
I can’t imagine as an American that I would claim to have the right to declare that Mr. Jones has too much so I’m going to take his money and give it to Mr Brown.
Target $152 come on already
"Institutions are pumping now energy, banks, and travel stock. When this is done they will come back on tech stock. Probably in Q3 2021. At that time apple will be $80."
All you can do is laugh while stocks like apple drop like a rock while trash sectors with a long recovery and meme stocks like gme take off. Accumulate and sit back and enjoy the ride back up like it always does.
What tomorrow $123?
"If you are long and seeing this destruction and not at all concerned...you probably own 1 share. Otherwise, you’re not happy watching this."
Will close green. Apple is the place to be! See you at 150 in the ides of March!
Friday price manipulation by MM as usual!!
First the shorts say how Buffet sold Apple. Now everyone piling in because of his endorsement of Apple. Make up your minds!
I’m curious if it is time to short. One out of 3 analyst of mine says yes. Ideas?
$127 tomorrow
"Most people will be loading up AAPL with the Stimulus check, Road to $200+ is underway."
ok how is $gme worth 2x $appl - two words robinhood weenies
"It was another great day for Apple stock; almost all market was down today but it was shining all the day? Hopefully, tomorrow it will close at $127; who knows it may open higher tomorrow morning."
buy SHANGHAI index huge tonight. TAIWAN HUGE ...FUTURES HUGE...AAPL 145 breakout is coming.
"When Warren buffett sold apple in december and bought Chevron at $84 it was a good move. Chevron is trading today at $105. He is already 25% in profit. And whoever bought apple 7 months ago, now is 2% in red."
"""Always remeber you are absolutely unique, just like everyone else"""
"It is very possible that between Friday and today the sentiment has changed, we will know soon if this is going to continue."
Reopening plays are getting SO expensive...there's better value in AAPL than almost any of the hot rotation names. Wont be long and the tsunami of buyers will be BACK!
Worst day this year for my portfolio. Good luck all and stay safe.
120 x 4 = $480 apples. No thank you.
Fair is fair!$2 dip now a $2 rally off of yesterday's clsoing price
Looks like stimulus will pass! Next week we get back on track
Guys I am new to stock market.. just want the experienced advise that is it still a better idea to put the money on Apple?
"apple needs to break up. split the organization into 4 operating companies. the intrinsic value would be 235.75 for the sum of its parts. more importantly, we won't have a too many outstanding shares float issue anymore."
"So many posters don't understand the Nasdaq is unwinding a sizable number of pandemic tech stocks....Roku, Zoom.....to mention just a few....plus, the unwinding of Tesla. Apple gets caught up in the tech rout, but is NOT a pandemic surge creation. Time to add to one's position in Apple. Bought 200 shares today. Very low lying fruit."
Any predictions for tomorrow?
Apple & Intel leading the DOW today . Good days ahead for two top Tech stocks to own long term
Derek's message that our intelligence agencies say the Chinese helped our current President get the job disappeared in seconds.
"Sam, like most Democrats, believes his freedom of speech is different than the freedom of speech of the rest of us."
settle down everyone....it is APPLE...sales in the billions....profits in the billions...holy cow man where do you think all the usa stimulus cheques are going to go....new iphones...new ipads...etc get a grib everyone....next earnings will be as explosive as the last....all is good in apple land ..lol
Bill to be voted within the hour and it will pass as predicted by Fox. Market will rocket to the sky Monday.
BIG RESISTANCE AT 122 ONCE WE BREAK THROUGH WE ARE GOING TO 126
Holding long. Hopefully we can gain some solid traction here soon.
we wasted 2 analyst upgrades yesterday. the most plausible scenario is that apple moves 10 % in 2 days next month.
I was watching that TV show on national Geographic in border protection.Why do they require passports and enforce immigration laws at the airport but at the border it is wide open anything goes ?Seems like the Border Protection Service is a total waste of money if they will not enforce the rules.My ancestors had to go follow the rules and go through Ellis Island.
To all the End time prophecy people who predicted Apples collapse last week 
If the buffet letter doesn’t move the stock on Monday along with the stimulus passing last night then the stock is broken and so is the market
"Not a bad time to look at EV names that just got pummeled, gov money going in that direction now."
"I have to laugh. ROKU finally turned a slight profit and has about 50 million active accounts. Now given a price target of $500 up from its current price of around $450. Don't get me wrong. I've used ROKU devices for years because they worked well with my PLEX server. However, it's hard for me to understand such a high share price with such weak overall fundamentals.So what gives with Apple's streaming strategy when Apple has almost 1.5 billion active devices they could target for Apple+ subscriptions. I just don't understand why Apple+ is lagging. Why isn't Apple loading up with competitive video content? Is Apple going to say they don't have the money while doing massive share buybacks? What is Apple thinking about when any company with cash can purchase decent video content. Why would Apple be easily beaten by ROKU unless Apple is clueless about what it takes to attract subscribers? I'm not angry, but I am puzzled with Apple's lethargic attitude towards increasing video content. It doesn't seem like rocket science to find content that would interest subscribers. If Apple could get even 10% of Apple device users to sign up for Apple+, they would blow away ROKU'S subscriber numbers. SVOD on AppleTV, iPhones, iPads, iMacs, and MacBooks should be easy-peasy for Apple. I honestly can't figure Apple out in this case. Good content is king. An empty video library is worthless. It seems as though Apple is simply giving away streaming subscribers away to rivals when there isn't a good reason to do so."
Tech coming back.
"It's heading lower to 81. Futures doesn't matter. The sell off will start as soon as market opens. NAS is going to hit 9000. The pump is too much, and so many bubbles. No growth ahead for AAPL or others. Sell off is real. I like AAPL at 81 and PE 20. It used to have 10-12 PE."
I can't wait for Mon so AAPL can resume its climb. Do people think a $2Tril company is going away?
I'm buying back in at 118 hopefully.
"US treasury Bonds are nose diving , I am buying the dip."
"did everyone sell at 127,, I did, just bought back in at 125.35"
"I had sold some $130 covered calls on my AAPL shares last week that expire this Friday, but I went ahead this morning and bought them back because I believe that this may run up to over $130 before the weekend and don't really want to sell my shares off at that price."
$130 at Friday Enjoy
An Apple a day should keep the RED away. Come-on Apple - back to $127 and beyond. We need $130 by Friday. March Madness - time to get your game on.
I want to buy Apple at $90.
"Oh my God the stimulus package passes the House and I am hoping it will pass the senate but the democrats have a majority in the senate too. Markets will rocket to the sky come Monday March 1, 2021"
"In just 1.5 hours, $55B GONE."
"I have been holding apple a long time with no action. Sad, waiting , waiting. waiting for it to move and it does zero for way to long. however, I also know December of this year . Only 10 months if the stock market is still behaving well . It should be $190. $200.00. easily"
"Wall Street Bets is slowly crashing the market. They are using around 12 stocks the same way they were using amc amd gme. They are slowly pumping and dumping née stocks like 1. eyes 2. Bayp. And the profits from the pump and dumps are being pumped into GME, AMC, PLTR, and many more. They are creating all the other stocks to be shorted and then all the traders can do is sell and buy wsb stocks or lose a lot of money. They will completely crash the stock market if this situation isn’t corrected. They brag about it on their Reddit website. It’s very easy to figure out if you study the market. They pump a new stock right after opening bell. 1. Eyes was the stock they pumped Friday. Friday they didn’t put their money back in GME and AMC and the other stocks to avoid detection."
if a ponzi stock like Tesla can bump 11% surely Apple can too
You are better off putting your money in a savings account and earning one tenth of 1% then owning AAPL
"Oh good, another red day for the Nasdaq. No news can get tech out of the gutter at the moment...."
People this stock was at $400 before the split what you scared for it will get there again takes time and this is a great and SAFE investment park it and leave it alone
"Selling less iPhones is PERFECT! Why do people go to APPLE? BECAUSE THEY MAKE QUALITY, superior products!!!! Apple always! Buy it, hold it b/c when it goes, you won’t catch it!"
cathie wood says Tesla will be 3000 in 2025. 3 trillion dollars market cap. what will apple be trading at in 2025. this means that Tesla will be number one in market cap race.
"Apple is one of those stocks you buy and forget about unless you day trade this (it is a good candidate to day trade)... but Ive invested long since 2007 and just keep addinng .... Ive learned to take in silly days as this, and just make bank LONG TERM"
APPLE 175 EOY. Enjoy the 'noise' and take advantage in the meantime.
This is so oversold. It’s about time we have an upward rally.
"AAPL has been buying back shares since 2013, a bad business decision. The shares should be bought back only when cheap."
"At 8:30 pm, the Fed may announce something that will make 10 Y treasuries yields, which in turn help the stock market to rally.Longs may get lucky."
"Make no mistake.Apple is consolidating right now.it went from 137 to 106 in sept/oct and consolidated around 117 for months,until the move in january to 145 before earnings.120 is the consolidation point this time.the time is near for the rise back up into earnings and hopefully a new ath.the big boys and gals have been buying and holding shares to get the demand above the supply.they have already done multiple test runs to see if balance has tipped into demand side.the tests have failed.you can see the tests in action if you watch moves minutes by minute. the last test day was march 1st when markets pushed stock price up to 128,the big boys released a few million shares into the market at about 3:30 just before market close and the stock crashed 3 bucks in 20 minutes.test failed.next test should be very soon."
Does anyone have any decent fundamentals as to why Apple is dropping like a hot potato?
"""As soon as,... ""next week"".... ""next month"".... ""next quarter"".... ""to the moon""...Hoping is not a strategy."
Yahoo Target for Apple is $150
A ten multiple should value AAPL around $50. Any other opinion is delusional. This is a run-of-the-mill hardware outfit.
"Another missed point on earnings and profit reports by companies is that CREATIVE ACCOUNTING IS LEGAL.Companies and even governments have no legal requirement to follow strict accounting rules when reporting to the public.No company is required to release irs offical tax filings to the public.what we see is a hodge podge.All companies are required to report using GAAP. GAAP filing rules are strictly set by a government entity like SEC,and can be found on SEC’s EDGAR in usa or SEDAR in canada.That being said even following GAAP rules there is still legal manipulation of numbers.companies can report revenue or expenses in different columns of the ledger to make the end results we look at different.alot of numbers go into eps calculations.write downs,deferrals etc are all legal ways to change end results.NON GAAP is what most companies release to the public.in statements,press releases most companies use NON GAAP reporting practices.NON GAAP is just a no rules mess that cant be used to compare companies at all.companies say that GAAP misses out on important metrics to accurately show a companies financial status,especially with technology companies because the rules for GAAP are outdated.This may be true but NON GAAP is the wild west of reporting and needs to be taken with skepticism.Even GAAP filings can be misleading and still be legal.Companies release NON GAAP for easy access in press releases and on company website.GAAP are harder to find because you need to search the SEC OR SEDAR filings and understand more accounting technical terms.ideally all companies would be required to release the IRS OR CRA filings then the truth would come out but its not required and i cant think of any company that ever did this.So in my opinion,to think that a company like Tesla didn’t manipulate numbers to show a profit after 17 years of loosing money,to get into the S&P,the year before the whole world knew that every auto manufacturer and dozens of new companies were getting into the EV game,is dumb.Musk does all of these things to keep the company in the headlines,the tweets,bitcoin buying,SEC public skirmishes etc,its all public manipulation.He took the chance,and by doing all the moves he made,the stock price has skyrocketed.congratulations Elon and Stock holders.this still doesnt change the facts that hes a rouge,big mouth,no filter narcissist,who will make a mistake one day and Tesla will implode.you play with fire and eventually you get burned.enjoy the ride gangmy opinion only$TSLA. $AAPL. $LSPD. $AAL"
Drip drip drip...Waiting a year for that little spike. Now you know why anyone with Apple money is either 90 yrs old or dead...
250+ tomorrow?
"So there are three fun possibilities for Apples  future: 1. The car. 2. AR headset/glasses and cryptocurrency . That’s not including iPhone sales, services and the watch! Being long is a no brainer!"
Who were the people who sold apple yesterday for 119 ? They will regret for sure
This is APPL buying back their own shares....I am convinced that this will stay between 122 to 126 until they announce dividend. Then the ride to 140s will start...
"With AAPL buy back (shares) it will go up but may be a little slower than we are used to. Institutions still own most of the shares, I don't thin they will lose anything. 0.07% % of Shares Held by All Insider59.66% % of Shares Held by Institutions59.70% % of Float Held by Institutions4,453 Number of Institutions Holding Shares"
"Einstein once aid. "" Insanity is doing something over and over then expecting different results"".Despite all the cheerleading or brow beating and muscling anyone does, AAPL is AAPL.There are three open trends of three above $125."

"Once again, may I direct your attention to a one year AAPL chart . . . or a two year chart . . . or a five year chart. After the last earnings report, do you really think it is going to stop all of a sudden?111 BILLION in revenue!Own it and sleep like a baby!"
I would like to know how many shares APPLE did buy back at this price.
My apple stock price is falling. Will the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill reimburse me for my losses? I voted for Joe Biden knowing he was going to take care of me. He better come through or I'll be writing in Bernie Sanders next time!
Big news heard apple is making their own crypto coin to power there platform...this is going to be big
Today’s 4:00 PM closing will have AAPL AT $125+. Apple has awakened and will surely surpass $130 early next week.
Apple will eventually have their own Banks and Cars for purchase. They more cash than any other company publicly traded. I think it’s still the perfect investment for the next 20 years. Ps support @118 were good
"Behavior Economics:my wife, son and neice are all 3 going to use their $1400 stimulus to upgrade iPhone...a no-brainer this behavior across the USA will push the masses to upgrade... and IMHO Apple will meet these new Analyst price points going forward into 4Q2021.the $Billions in Stimuli going into State Educational Infrastructure suggests that virtual learning and iPad+Mac upgrades will be Huge too (?)"
Grea buy point for long term holders!
Look how fast it came up from $116 not long ago! She’s back
Bought 160 shares. Total holding nearing to 500 :)
why up nicely AH? hoping for 140+ sooner (y)
Apple must be ramping up the buybacks as they do with every pullback and correction
Why are so many people fighting this? Big tech is clearly frothy and bubble in many areas. Nflx should be a 10 pe name in end for example. U can fight rates and the trends all u want but PE compression will continue until the whole sector trades below fair value. Tech IS cyclical in end or it turns into a utility. either way most tech names other than 3d printing are doing nothing groundbreaking anymore
"Joe mentioned “President Harris” twice, today....uh oh..."
Ok not sure what some people are talking about but Apple is about to announce who they are finalizing to build the ICAR this thing can possible double pretty quick it’s been to $400 before split it can get there again easily
Sunday I predicted that AAPL will close on Monday $2+ and yesterday’s prediction that AAPL will close today $1.18+ so far so good. This evening I will post AAPL approximate closing for tomorrow.
Amazing how Buffett does a buyback announcement 5 hours after stimulus package agreed on￼
"2021 will be Apples worst year yet. At some point people wise up, apple is outdated/bland products."
Warren Buffett is now buying more of Apple. A very smart move. This gentleman has given his shareholders an average yearly return of 23.3% since 1959. What a performance. Feel sorry for those who sold. Even when he sold some of Apple he still held 938 millions of Apple shares and now he is buying more. So dear friends stay invested long term and don’t listen to the doomy gloomy  people. For God’s sake understand they don’t have your interest in their mind . All they are worried is about themselves. As a former short and a former daily trader isn’t that a lot to say?
"Wow! Was not paying attention yesterday was the third print of $120+ as an intra day low.Ok! WE have that behind us now,There are two open trends in the $130+'s"
Baidu went from 120 to 346 in 2 months bc of a electric vehicle announcement.
Apple selling off because Timmy cook sold his shares to buy Nokia because he could get a better return.
Why would you sell a company that has $90.0 billions in cash on hand...
Should pick up the last 10-15 minutes into the close and hit daytime highs.
"If tomorrow will go down again, i will sell everything and will buy Jets stocks, they are green everyday"
Apple FCF will allow it to keep buying back shares as eps and the stock price increases....just like Autozone...
Is the jump today on all apple stores opening? or something else?
"aapl is muted today...when everything else is running up...we havent even break the 122 yet, not mention when to test 127, 131.....I need to go on a spring break and stop checking on it"
"We are the long warriors holding the line, we wont sell it!"
Stimulus package in House Vote tomorrow morning (Saturday ). Market will rocket to the sky next week
It hurts to much to see this go down. It hurts more to see the stocks I sold to buy apple are soo up :(
Tech is the new Value....reopening plays are way overpriced already! PEs higher than AAPL....buyers will be BACK!
Somebody bought 60m share at 4pm. Will be huge green on Monday!!
"the Nasdaq composite is way oversold, expect a huge rally on Monday."
"Pandemic, Massive Unemployment, Printing gobs of money, and a trillion shares...They think they're gonna make money in this environment..."
AAPL will be like Stonehenge. Forever and awesome. Market dips mean nothing in long run for a $2T company.
Question remains....are we out of the 110's forever?
Hopefully she holds pre market
"After telling us for the last couple of weeks that tech is dead, CNBC will start telling us sometime next week that tech is undervalued."
Told you all to relax :) next week will be even better. This thing will keep rallying until next earnings call 
"Everyone on this thread who is bearish on Apple, keep selling those shares discounted to me. Comical!"
"All easy-money crypto and stock scams are petering out. I expect a return to quality this week. Apple 140 EOW, higher with car detail divulgence."
$1400 each in action
119-119.1 close??retest has to come next week of recent lows. lets see.
"Apple will become a 10T company in the future, that’s all what I care. Ignore all fluctuations and just buy and hold!"
"Buffett cut Apple, Baron trimmed Tesla"
Powell will jibber jibber then we will turned positive. So hold on folks. Thanko
AAPL is starting to wake up
High PE stocks will get killed. I lived through March 2000 and was in stocks. It sure feels the same now. If you made a good profit here. Take it. With 10 year tripling in a month a going higher. Boy PE will readjust to 12-16. Good luck to your all.
See children? This is why when the market is selling you should be accumulating. It’s as simple as that!￼
ive had it with the stock market im done. im selling everything im never buying stocks ever again.
"Monday morning opened a short strangle: 110P, 129C. Added a few more 115Ps on tuesday afternoon.No regrets. Completely agnostic on direction. Just collecting premium on volatility.1% / week goal."
Some of the largest apple holders are from Vanguard and BR. These are LT holders. All the other over diversified portfolios will look for a solid tech stock... APPLE will be the clear choice once again just like in 2019. $150 stock price by May.
Wait till Apple starts selling EVs... better start loading up and holding.
"Dow and Russel turned positive. Soon Nasdaq and S&P will go into positive territory and Apple will follow. More upgrades coming with higher price . Warren is buying. Pension Funds from Norway, Denmark and Canada are buying. Overseas call came telling me they are buying Technology such as Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Qualcomm, NXP, Marvell etc and don’t forget stimulus money between $350 to $750 will pour or has started pouring into the market and Powell is upbeat but will leave low interest rates alone for at least two to three years."
"Repeat after me, AAPL has real significant current earnings and cash flows. It's market value is not dependent upon speculative additional earnings to come way into the future like no earnings techs!"
Yahoo price target for AAPL is $151

"Out of all the Tesla competitors.1. Only Lucid has a robot filled AZ EV factory that will produce 400k luxury Airs & Gravity SUVs per year.2. Only Lucid has a 510+ mile battery and leading edge battery patents from making the Formula One EV racecar battery.3. Only Lucid is flush with 4.4 Billion in cash with real plans to ramp production to $TSLA sized volumes.4. Only Lucid has Rawlinson, the engineering brains behind the superbly well built Tesla Model S.5. It took 15 long years for Tesla to open the EV door and Lucid is going to be the 2nd racehorse to slam through and why it will soon move to a few hundred billion marketcap. $TSLA & Lucid will rule them all. $nio $aapl"
Thank god I’m already retired getting drunk in Phuket Thailand on St Patty day. 90 degrees today . 
yo ladies and gentlemen got to do some ketch up today from yesterday. Yes siri bob we will be up today. But remember the whole market was down. Powell wants to be found so he can become a movie star hence cometh on TV and conferences every week.
EV’s are gaining traction. Everyone wants to be the electric auto business.
"Here's the problem...The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 1.533% after Powell's comments, which did not point to changes in the Fed's asset purchases to tackle the recent jump in yields. It still held below last week's one-year high of 1.614%.Some investors had expected the Fed might step up purchases of long-term bonds, helping push down long-term interest rates."
it's great not owning apple anymore. my Tesla is up 31 today so far.
the question this week is will apple announce an online March event for the rest of the M1 Macs
"Again, there’s no reason to panic on this stock. It follows technical analysis like a textbook and the company is extremely good on fundamentals. Even if it ends up red again today, I’m not concerned at all."

"Apple Has Slumped. Here’s Why Morgan Stanley Says to Buy the Stock and Ignore the ‘Noise.’”We’ve anecdotally heard from our semiconductor colleagues that Apple’s memory purchases remain robust, which would run counter to the narrative of significant iPhone cuts,” she writes. “Bringing this all together, we believe the news around large iPhone production cuts are likely more supply chain noise than a material concern.”"

Coming back very strongly. Look at the long term horizon and don’t lose heart and or panic. A great quarter is about to end. Apple will rocket to the sky a distant galaxy.

"i hear apples dividend is not worth much alot.you wont find another company other than microsoft that grows so much each year and pays any dividend.it adds up over time.for easy math lets say today at this stock price 120 apple pays 1$ dividend.if you bought $100000 worth of stock when apple first started paying dividends in 2012 you could have bought at $20 per share thats 5000 shares.that today is 5000 dollars per year in dividends which is 5%.also youre 100000 is 600000 today.so 6x original investment and 5% dividend in bank.pretty sweet.over time dividend increases really add up.where u find a 5% dividend now in a bank or real estate company maybe,but that stock didn’t increase 6x in 9 years like apple.real estate stays flat pretty much over a ten year period and banks maybe double.maybe.Dont kid yourself that .8% dividend adds up over 10-20-30 years and apple is a lifetime hold right?"
"No so called expert can predict the market on a daily basis, but the great top corporations are an open book as to information needed to make a wise educated investment on a long term basis. There is no question that AAPL is one of these companies. Bottom line invest in Apple long term and you will be a winner. In AAPL case history does repeat. AAPL is without a doubt a long term winner."
98% of investors and 97% of employees think cook is slacking off big time as stock has underperformed every metric. COOK RESIGN
As my prediction of last night on this page AAPL to close $2+ at 4 PM thankfully came to fruition. Later tonight I will post tomorrow’s prediction.
"Apple is the pinnacle of American Enterprise. They will be like investing in JNJ in the 1960’s. Just one of those stocks you can buy, hold and compound forever."
You can’t short Apple this will open $124 plus on Monday and will reach $130 by the end of the week

After split Apple is no longer a growth stock.
"Big loss for AAPL. I see it down to 112 on this news, and then 81"
"Apple TV + is just in it’s beginning stages. Right now Apple is giving away free subscriptions to people who buy a new iPhone or other Apple products. Netflix was doing something similar but with there free monthly trials. Apple is a much bigger company and Apple TV came out very recently. When Netflix first came out, it’s share pricewas about $10 a share. Apple’s current stock price doesn’t even reflect the amount of money they will be bringing in from investors. This is guaranteed monthly income from future subscribers. In less than 5 years we could see massive stock price growth from just Apple TV +. Apple has also partnered with studious around the world to deliver the best content. One of these studios is Wild Brain! Wild Brain delivers children’s content such as Snoopy series, teletubbies, and massive content on YouTube. If you want to check out Wild Brain’s stock ticker, here it is: WLDBF. I highly recommend investing in this. Wild brain could be the next Netflix."
Why is Apple taking off this morning? What’s Cooking?
"There is a upward trend line back to last august,we bounced right off it at 116 on tuesday.Ifwe hold 118ish we should be good.Dont give up now if you've road it down to here."
What does Apple get in return for its “investments” in various companies (like the one reported today). Just positive PR? How does this help shareholders?
$145 before April
It’s really unbelievable that they are selling the big tech names that are making record earnings and buying travel and leisure names that can’t run two nickels together
"If you want to make money fast, you will lose it fast on other stocks. Buy good business and hold for long term, newbies!"

Fun fact: AAPL will be at $200 by end of the year.
AAPL HAS MAJOR SUPPORT AT 118.00 from there next stop is 145 by June 2021
"There is a disconnect now that all industrial, banks and energy stocks went up way more than pre pandemic level. Dow is all time high while Nasdaq is 1000 points down. Guess what? We are looking 400/500 points up Nasdaq any day. Institutions chasing you into the so-called value stocks and they will dump in the nick of time. They will be back to growth of tech....that’s the truth...I am holding all my tech holding...you should too"
"whats amazing is how many sellers there are in premarket, apple is no longer the same stock it once was, the company is the same but the investor is afraid to own apple now"
Where will the Apple share price be in 10 years from now?
"if apple is upgraded twice today, and the stock is seriously damaged, its obvious that the stock has peaked, and no one believes in it any more."
"Daryanani maintains his Overweight rating and $163 price target on Apple shares.Apple's growth strategy in recent quarters has been driven in part by expansion of its services business, which includes subscription offerings in music, video, gaming, and fitness, among other things. In the December quarter, services revenue jumped 24% to $15.7 billion. And the early signs on services revenue for the March quarter are looking good, as well.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note Tuesday that Apple (ticker: AAPL) App Store revenue grew 30% in February for ""another strong month."" He estimates that App Store developer revenue was $4.4 billion in the quarter, up 30%, after gains of 40% in January and 31% in December.The analyst notes that Wall Street models call for services growth to decelerate to 16% in the March quarter, but he thinks the ongoing strength in app downloads point to ""an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates.""Daryanani estimates that Apple should be able to grow services at a 19% compounded growth rate through the September 2024 fiscal year, at which point revenues from the segment would top $100 billion. He thinks that will include $29 billion from Apple Music and $6 million from Apple Pay.He also expects Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ to gain transaction over the next five years, with 80 million to 90 million subscribers each. At $100 billion, he adds, services would be 30% of Apple's overall revenue and 45% of gross profit."
I would not be surprised if both Google and msft reach $2 thrillions each by year end 2021 and Apple easily passes by $3 thrillions by the end of 2021
"20-yr holder of Apple here again, with some more analysis of past data. Let's focus on periods where the stock price didn't produce a new high for over 6 months (120 trading days). Since December 13, 2000 (my first purchase of AAPL shares), there have been 7 such periods:5/21/2001 to 3/5/2004, 712 trading days (3 years!), with a 50.7% loss inbetween (4/17/2003)Any sane investor may have bailed in April 2003, having lost half their money by then. But it recovered so well, the stock split x2 on 2/28/2005...one year after the new high. The iPod was coming into its own.2/16/2005 to 8/12/2005, 123 days, with a 24.3% loss inbetween (5/12/2005)Surprising, after the split on 2/28/2005, the stock went into a lull, bottoming out in 5/12/2005, but recovered by 8/12/2005.1/13/2006 to 11/16/2006, 213 days, with 40.8% loss inbetween (7/14/2006)People were getting bored with the iPod. The hype of the new iPhone rumors drove the price up going into 2007's iphone release. The price rose throughout most of 2007, more than doubling by 12/28/2007, but then the next lull happened...12/28/2007 to 10/21/2009, 457 days (almost 2 years!), with 60.9% loss!! (1/20/2009)Again, lots of people bailing out on that tailspin, but Apple was starting to overtake the iPhone market with its 3GS. This was the heyday of Apple, because we didn't have another extended lull until...9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, with 44.4% loss (4/19/2013)I think Steve Jobs' passing had a lot to do with that (Oct 2011), but they did introduce the dividend in June 2012. There were some gains in that 480-day period, but they never reached the previous high. Still, it didn't revover until the announcement of the June 2014 x7 stock split.2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, with 32.1% loss (5/12/2016)Another two year lull...but only 32%. And now the last one...10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, with 38.7% lossBy this time, today, in 2021, I don't care about lulls. APPLE ALWAYS COMES BACK. AAPL had that 31% drop with the COVID stuff in 2020...only lasted 70 days or so...who cares? Golden buying opportunities, all of them!The moral of the story: APPLE ALWAYS RECOVERS. I see people here lamenting that it hasn't gone up every single day since the latest split, lol. We hit 142 recently, and that's PROBABLY going to be a new high for a while! Look, we're due for another lull. And that's OK. If you're a smart, patient, long-term investor, you'll be fine, and you'll be buying more soon, lol."
AAPL or IBM? both are in low 120 both pays dividends at different rates.I own AAPL shares purchased at 132.90 and 129.80 now deciding to average down AAPL or establish positions in IBM.
Come on Apple!! Another 5% gain today please!!
"I am 80 percent sure this a sector rotation again. This type of move dosnt just happend to aapl. Look at the indexes how they are moving the total opposite of last week. If you mix this with the stimulus, apple will go to 200 soon. My opinion."
"Waiting on my target price so that I can buy a few more shares. Apple is a great company and these purchases are for my son. The dividend is ok, but I'm mainly excited about stock appreciation per share; big investors who hold a huge amount of shares rely on the dividend but I'm a middle class so my lesson to my son is apreciation. Have a good one everyone."
"Amazon, google, Microsoft down - Apple up? Are my eyes deceiving me?"
I sold 260 shares of apple at high today!Did not lose money but did not make alot...onlyabove $1k but I am comfortable. Apple has zero innovation and fat cash cow company that does nothing to innovate. I will put this money into $AMZN f or BETTER GROWTH year to year.Good luck everyone Ciao!
"With all the future revenue and profit Amit Daryanani and other analysts are forecasting Apple to accrue in the coming months and years, it’s incredible stockholders would be selling their shares here"
"Todays action tells you how fast this stock can go up or down! I am not saying the correction is over, no one knows that, but this can also happen on the upside which will make $150 a cake walk when its ready."
so do you sell at a loss or buy more? four years is a long time
Stimulus package passes the house. Very positive affect on the market come Monday
I’m looking to start a position in AAPL but am concerned about a trailing P/E ratio of 32. Looking at the last 5 years this ratio was in the 20-25 range. Using the current earnings of $3.69 per share that equals a share price range from $74-$92. Even using the high end of $92 the current share price is +32%. Does the near-term guidance from the company really support a $121 share price?
tech lovers are going to be buying a lot of dips this week. Get your fill. Get that denial out. All of it out.
LET'S SHORT SQUEEZE AAPL!!! Come on Reddit!! Squeeze it real good! Bullish!!
"We will soon see AAPL breakout above it's high,"

"Oh my God trending now in Barron’s by Ed Lin dated March 15, 2021 “ a large pension bought up GE, NIO, Apple and a Chip Stock”. That pension fund is the Ontario pension plan . First it was Denmark then Norway and now Ontario Canada. And you guys should do the same . Even my uncle Warren Buffett is buying more . I wish he was my uncle but at least I consider him my uncle or a Guru of Investors."
When it gets low enough they'll be buying hand over fist sending to new highs as usual.
Sooner or later this  has to turn . I am still holding and hoping.
RSI is below 30...way oversold....looking for a big come back...$8-10 up on a single day
"I sold yesterday 1700 shares. I shouldn't of. I'm getting back in today on any dip. I was up 30k, and it went down to nothing. Was angry. However, there has been so much going on Bitcoin, Tesla boom, and other quick money that took away fro Apples great earning release. Ending up losing 2k overall. If I would of stay would of been up 1.4k."
"Buffett calls Apple, still his largest holding, his family jewel. "
I thought the futures were going to be much stronger on the Nasdaq. only up 68.
Tomorrow 135 ...Friday 145
Selling at the end of the day is a bearish sign ala candle indicator
"Bottom, Load up Big Time !"
Buffet is right never bet against good fundamentals!Either its apple or whatever company is irrelevant.
This has to be Buffett buying in dont sell your shares for 2 days this will be at $135 if he’s buying in
"Seems like a lot of young dudes here taking trading advice from other young dudes. My advice is learn something about fundamentals, balance sheets and what a 10k is. Quit looking for overnight profits. Peter Lynch ""One Up On Wall street"" is a solid read."
Market is a little under pressure because Jereme Powell will speak today . News is that he will be very accommodating and the market will rocket as long term yields come tumbling down. I am actually buying more today. Also stimulus money of which between $360 to $750 billions will come pouring into the market. The process has already started.
"The yield on the 10-year bond yield was the center of attention again in early dealings, rising to 1.62% after U.S. producer prices rose at their fastest rate in over two years in February."

"""RBC Capital upgrades AAPL price target to $171""Feb 8. 2021"
All the shorts who were hoping for an AAPL crash last week should know that this company will have revenue and new products forever.
Gene Munster says buy buy buy Apple today on CNBC. He also like Zillow and Unity Software. He think Zillow could be $400 in a few years as home purchases and the closing aspects is done through Zillow.
this is the type of market that turns people into daytraders. down for two weeks. why hold stocks anymore? should just daytrade buying at bottom of days dip around 9:38am and selling the recovery move on the daily. that would be way more profitable than holding shares.
"Now people are talking about Apple filing for BK! LOL! so many people take drugs and medication on this board. Tell me what fundamentally has changed for companies like Apple, Amazon, Tesla? nothing!"
"Buffett talking the power of share buybacks:""The math of repurchases grinds away slowly, but can be powerful over time,"" he wrote. ""The process offers a simple way for investors to own an ever-expanding portion of exceptional businesses."""
"On the chart, AAPL has broke below the 100 day moving average of $125, which had been strong support for a long time. Looks like it could go all the way to the 200 day at $113.50. If it does, it would be a great buy there."
Bottom feeders in full force overnight and tomorrow...don’t miss out!
$NLST $GOOG is already in the cross hairs of 2 anti trust cases of their search and search advertising monopoly... They are defending by saying that Google search and search advertising is a consumer choice even though they pay i.e. $AAPL $12 billion each year to have $GOOG browser as the default... Also on Android $GOOG is the default search engine...How convenient is it when it turns out that $GOOG again obtained their search monopoly through illegal means by infringing on a small company for more than a decade and lying against a judge about it in all newspapers ... Think about it... Netlist is going to drag Google through the streets and newspapers across the country whilst Google already has is in cross hairs with regard to it's business practices... It's the nail in their coffin imo ...https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuits-explainer/amp
This is hilarious to be that we have a drop because of unemployment numbers. Who in their right mind thought unemployment was going to magically get better?
The treasury yield is 1.60 and stocks are gonna tank
"Up nearly 500% in 5 years, 72% in the last 12 months, 17% in the past 3 months, 5% in the last 30 days... Seems like a healthy stock to me."
"The much higher taxes coming will be GOOD for Apple! People will have less money to travel, dine out, and buy things. What will they do? They will sit in front of their iPhones and iPads and watch Apple TV."
This week's trading is almost a mirror of last week's.If next week is like this week's; We will see a nice move higher on Monday and Tuesday
apple is back to normal.
"ATTENTION: STIMMY CHECKS WILL MOSTLY BE USED TOWARDS UNPAID RENT, AND BILLS. OR SIMPLY SAVED. IT WILL NOT BOOST THE ECONOMY."
Just a reminder that AAPL hit 116.21 on March 8th. It doesn't take much time to regain off the lows. We are just experiencing much volatility and the treasury notes are just WS latest excuse to rebalance before the next leg up. Does anyone really think a 2% yield on a 10 year note will outperform Apple?
I was actually mistaken about AAPL’s cash. When you include short term investments their cash is $91 billion. Free cash flow is $73 billion. Again I ask what case do AAPL bears have here?
"Apple's first augmented reality headset is coming next year, says analyst."
"Stimulus money is only to used at Apple stores, they wrote this in the bill "
Barrons reported that AAPL stopped production of I Phones.This will drop the shares in half or lower.

"Be patient. Reality will again set in. Cruise liners are acting like they are back in full swing but in reality they are suspended in the US indefinitely. The reopening trade has stocks like RCL, MAR, ALK and AAL running up like we have forgotten they were just asking for government funding to survive a few months ago. Throw out AAPL and MSFT as they have crushed earnings and are rich with cash. The pigeons will soon come home to roost!"
Always up AH on Fri. Clearly AAPL only manipulated DURING the session every Fri
Look at the one month and six month charts. It couldn't be clearer.

It’s taken less than 12hrs for bond yield (10 year) to get where it was a few days ago Powell you’ve lost control of the yield curve
Anyhoo I still think its bottomed around this 120 even if it drifts down a little bit. Then I'd take the gift. Strong balance sheet voids out higher interest rate fear.
This price will not stay this low for long...
"$119, my my! What a bargain this has become. We will never see discounts like this again! It's a great play. I'm in with 2 shares!"

"I get the tech sell off. Tesla is a rip off at its current PE. ZOOM was an absolute rip off at is valuation. Zillow was completely over baked. However, Apple is a monster and the most profitable company in the world with a PE around 30. My advice if you want stability is buy now or pay a lot more 1 year from now."
Wow no fed until 2023...tgst is unbelievable! Risk On!!!
They fluctuated a lot of money away from my calls 3/19 calls Yesterday I was up big I bought when the stock was down Then it rallied late. I couldn’t take on That many day trades so I was stuck watching it grow and stuck watching it go all the way down￼. I guess at this point something George Costanza would say From the episode stock tip￼ I’m going down with the ship￼

"there really seems to be a lack of knowledge on why high growth is falling on bond yield rising.high growth stocks with no positive eps or little are priced today for what they may be worth in 3-5 years.no investor will give a 1000p/e stock 1 penny if they didnt believe in next few years they will get that p/e down to 50 or 20 in 5 years.investors are not selling apple or tesla to buy a bond today.but rising yields that are gaining and dropping large % each day is a big problem.with inflation,higher yields and fed lifting rates up in 3-5 years means a 10 year bond may be 6% in 3-5 years.then the move to bonds will be a flood.so today .....investors leave these stocks and move into other areas that like rising yields and rates like banks and life insurance companies.notice how these banks etc are at or new all time highs,and most pay a nice dividend.investors haven’t deserted high growth,they left till prices come down far enough to be inline with the expected future macro environment.p/e matters,market value matters.all the new investors dumped trillions into the markets pushing up certain stocks way above value.now those same investors will get a lesson in a correction."
"Wow, a collapse is imminent. Longs are complacent again. They will get depressed again today."
AAPL is easy. No worries and your money grows. GLTA
"Whoever bought apple 7 months ago, now is in red. If you are happy with this, then enjoy."
"Now with PE ratio falling back into the 20s, AAPL is a screaming BUY!"
"Do you know why all of the tech stocks are getting hammered? When I try to tell you what the economists are saying on Bloomberg and CNBC, Yahoo censors my postings! The marxists who control all of the content are censoring the truth hoping that the mind numb robots who get brainwashed by MSNBC, CNN, NYT, Wash Post, Huffington Post, Daily Beast, Yahoo, and other leftwing liberal rags will never find out until it's too late!"
"The question is not IF Apple goes up, the question is WHEN. Guaranteerd profit when buying Apple stocks and wait for some years. What kind of person would not buy Apple or MSFT?"
$130 today  DONT SELLL YOUR SHARES this will keep going up
Google This :APPLE / LIQUIDMETAL-(LQMT) has been AN APPLE SECRET LONG TERM STRATEGY SINCE 2010. Apple and LQMT share over 100 patents for BMG production technology. Liquidmetal is all about Apple.Apple will be using LIQUIDMETAL BMG in everything APPLE .LONG APPLE LONG LQMT
There is absolutely no way Apple is going anywhere. Ecosystem is huge part of every household
"I hope you used today's unexpected massive rally to sell your AAPL shares because the US stock futures are rolling over,. They may drop limit-down overnight."
"@Rick, very funny but you are not too far from reality. In Miami the Ruskis are coming to the US to have their kids born American citizens and therefore qualify to run for presidency.... how you like that strategy"
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has a target of $175 for Apple. He calls recent declines in the stock a “golden buying opportunity”.
I just talked with Tim Cook and he told promised to buy me a new Rickenbacker nest week. CASE CLOSED.
"Tuesday not only marks the 48th day of Sleepy's presidency, it also marks the longest a commander-in-chief has gone in recent history without holding a solo press conference."
I've sold my position in AAPL and have assumed the position in $PLTR
"eventually, by end of 2021, APPL will go back up, and will take previous high and keep climbing into $200+ but meantime, it is painful to watch."
"Appl is a winner, is a winner, is a winner. I have to thank this great company for allowing me to retire very comfortably very soon. I have never sold a share, always bought the dip..picked up 100 shares today at 116.76...placed an order for another 100 at 116 limit and another 100 at 115.50. Just be patient and Aapl will reward you very handsomely. Panasonic deserves a closer look. Happy investing to all."
"think of how many loyal customers to apple. I guess just for iPhone is over 1.2 billion and most of these are not willing to switch. most of these also have IPAds and laptops users for iTunes and apple store. who do not have ear pods.I asked one of my friends who had 4 kids do you use apple products, the answer wasI have 6 I phones, 8 I pads, 5 laptops and 4 apple watches23 items from apple just in one family.I think we are stuck with apple for a long time and you could imagine what this translate into revenue generation and growth.apple is know for its quality and if it invade the EV market, it will crush Tesla and loyal customers will continue the journey with Apple car and leave it up to you to imagine the value and the price of apple stock"
Cool we’re up 22 cents today. I can finally retire.
"If it falls off a cliff today, there is something in the fundamentals and financials that are not published that insiders are aware of and not telling the public...a real fundamental problem with Apple"
Good luck everyone! Stay strong!
Crashing big time pre-market
Have a nice weekend everyone. Don’t think too much. Stay optimistic. Hope is like a soap. We must use it daily. Next week should be better.
"apple is on a death spiral. sadly, after holding my shares for so long I sold it all. I can't take these two and 3% drops on a daily basis. I am out."
Guys.....I just woke up from my dream. I saw the future and Apple share was at $200 by 12/21/21.
Trading 101 : Don't buy or sell in the first 30 minutes after the market opens. If you didn't already know this then you shouldn't trade stocks.
really wanted a down market and chance for squeeze. Let's ride this past 125$! PT HERE around 145$.
Dow and Russell both slightly positive but S&P and Nasdaq futures down. My opinion things will turnaround and they will all go higher today.
Heard on one of the trading education talk shows over the weekend that the rotation out of AAPL is largely due to large swaths of investors having to cover margin calls. Same reason that gold is not going up with this downturn at the moment - people will try to hang onto their upside down positions as long as possible and sell anything that's made them money. Bonds are secondary reason as those running skittish are willing to take low returns for safety. Hosts made it sound like this will right itself but the upside down margin players having to answer their debt calls have to be wrung out first.
I am going to wait on what it looks like mid day today. Any price can be set during pre-market.
"Market is a mess but once it finds its support, AAPL will be back up and reaching for $150 this year. When has AAPL stock ever failed us??? NEVER and it’s not about to this year. $150 in 2021. Mark my words"
But wait !If you act now we will double the shares.Just pay separate 25% shipping .
Never lose confidence in APPL. Looking forward to continued growth.
Wedbush just slapped a bull case PT on APPL to $225!!!!!!!!! BOOM!!!!!!!!!!
"A $1,400 stimulus check in U.S. citizens pockets is not going to prevent the next market crash. There will be sellers raising cash to pay off capital gains taxes due 4/15/21 which should add to the calamity."
"game stop ytd is up only 1,360 percent, apple down 10 percent. I sold 90%, of my Tesla holdings for a 2 point gain this time. 100% holding in game stop now. my last cost is 249.34, now 282.01"
Futures looking nice and green. Holding for a nice rally back to 125+
Current price of Apple share at Frankfurt is USD 124.46!! Hope it will go up this whole week!
"Hey when free money sugar high wears off and sleepy joe raises taxes thru the roof, how well will apple perform then ........ hmmmn"
I never thought AAPL can be manipulated like this by hedge funds
Apple car gonna make this stock take off!
"One time I bodyguard the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in late 1980's, There were over 20 security types but I was detailed to drive 20 attache cases of $1 million US each = $20 million in total.Why?Think about it"
"I agree that the news about Buffett selling SOME shares is a huge overreaction. I'm taking the opportunity to accumulate on as many dips that I can so I plan to buy a few more shares on Friday this week. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Apple, it just recorded a record breaking quarter. And Warren is still holding about half his portfolio in Apple. Money managers rotate their portfolios all the time. Who cares, buy the dip."
I’ll take it! Beats being red.
"Powell stated a little bit of inflation and it should subside after businesses start opening. Of course there will be some inflation, businesses will try to recoup as much losses from Covid as possible. Honestly, this is a buying opportunity the only problem is where do you jump in. Apple is very inexpensive at any point below 120. Not only is Apple inexpensive, many other stocks are taking a bath as well lot of opportunities out there Apple is a stable investment though."
"Buy and hold, buy and hold, but the shorts are taking the air out if your balloon! People didn't used to short AAPL. It's the new game in town."
"Hey whatever reason the create for sell off , economy improve market sell off , economy decline market sell off , dude they going to sell and buy whatever excuses they come up with for any movement.All i know is aapl is a great profit revenue machine and i like to own companies that make a profit and beat there earnings call.Everything else is noise."
Numbers do not lie!Look at where AAPL was this time every year then in Dec of that year
When dividends date ? And what tomorrow red or Green Day?
Say goodbye Cook. Long past your resignation time. You've gone stale.
Looks like it will reach 135 before any real resistance.
Lots of iphones about to be sold...stimulus phone!
"Apple Eclipses Samsung as Top Smartphone VendorThe introduction of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 12 family helped the smartphone giant overtake Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. as the top smartphone vendor in the holiday quarter, according to Gartner, marking Apple's first time holding down the top position in four years."
Shorts are having a rough day...
"Overall I picked up 500 shares total, total of 2500 now. Please,, Sec this is your job. Please start doing it. So you telling that apple went down 3 dollar in 5 minutes and you guys are not going to do anything about it. We are talking about the most valuable company in the U.S."
"Excellent! congrats to all longs, Apple is a sure bet, as always."
"I read how a $1,000 in AAPL stock upon the release of the first iPhone is now worth $30,000. People whom stayed long despite all these hiccups were the true winners"
Put your money in Depends stock.JB changes his 6 times a day.
Something is brewing
Face it. The party is over. There is no upside left in this bloated market. Stimulus has long since been baked in. What isn't baked in is INFLATION. Next: a market death spiral.
they are selling out of the value stocks and back into growth like apple and tech stocks to rebalance at monthend. the close should be interesting
"Barron’s March 12, 2021 article by Jacob sonenshine “stocks could rally 10% soon and here is the reason why”."
FACT: Did you know that the 10y yield average for the last 8 years (during the historic bull market) was 2.36%. That's right! The greatest bull run was expanding as the 10 yr was at 2.36% on average.
Those New APPLE Phones are flying off the shelves !This is a 200 dollar stock selling for 126 ?Trade accordingly !
Fisker that there is 3rd partner ... and that partner is NOT a contract partner...Note...NOT a contract partner. read between the lines....I suspect $AAPL or $FB or $MSFT or $GOOG
Could very easily hit $130 today! One step at a time
Every time I've ever tried to times the market I've lost. So I just go back to the three rules of Apple investing: 1) Buy Apple shares 2) Never sell Apple shares no matter what 3) Repeat.
just like we have been warning you this isn't the original aapl. sell
Finally $125!!
Apple is starting to buy back shares.
"Patience Grasshopper. ""You may leave, when you can #$%$ the pebbles from my hand""This company has made many millionaires over the last 20 years and will continue to do so.... every institution holds it, it's worth more than most countries GDP. It's a long term stock to hold."
"Russell 2000 aka FRAUD index gets PUMPED by 20% per months since March 2020, ""MAGICALLY"".The funny thing is Russell 2000 companies are fundamentally Bankrupt cash burning Scams. How these companies can suddenly worth 200% more in no time for no reason?$AAPL $JPM $TSLA $AMZN"
"Soon, you'll be able to AirTag your apple stock shares so you know where they are. How many remember those days?"
"AAPL is an option-driven stock—which means writers are banking on the long interest to produce a steady income leveraging their huge position—a position they’ll never close (they cannot—biggest company in the world), so they care less if pps rallies uncontrollably like TSLA—in fact it’s not in their best interest. What AAPL needs to go up is for short interest to overtake"
"we'll come back and when we do you should dump stocks and buy crypto, this isn't a ""market"" as long as the sell side can endlessly borrow shares to dump."
FUN FACTS!! If you purchased $15000.00 worth of AAPL last week at 121.80 It would now be worth $14775.now If you purchased 15K of GME at the same time– your 15K would be worth $76442. now. I kid you not.
If any one takes Mike’s advise and wait to buy at $80 you may find $80 post next split. Obviously Mike is a short or very uninformed.
"I’m holding this for at least another 10 years, so who cares.! Let it drop! I’m just adding more.￼"
"I just want to say:(1) Stock prices always fluctuate.(2) Apple is volatile!(3) With great risks come great rewards(4) Its reached its all time high many times - i don't see why it wont again!(5) Keep holding!! Don't sell!Consider it a business. Some days we sell things and make money, some days we have no customers and literally make no money. But at the end of the day, see the progress month over month or quarter over quarter.Hope this helps some of the newer investors (who probably bought at $140s."
"big week to test critical technical points, if cannot break with 1.9 T, then we may face longer depressing time on this board, FYI I hold big bag here, still long, but short turn is hard to say, we need big players to jump back in..."
"Every stock board is filled with the claim manipulation . That is not manipulation . That is poor planning, bad decision making , poor trading on the retial guys part . Manipulation isoneof the most misused terms in the english language .If I have to go to a family gathering , I don`t want to go , I rub my head, wife says what is going on , I banged my head not sure how I feel. She says maybe stay home. Everything is manipulation . Unless it is illegal then it does not matter. When you sell real estate you inflate the price as you know you will get a lower offer , manipulation ? I always ask but never am answered if you KNOW WHAT THE BIG BOYS ARE GOING TO DO , THEN WHY DON` T YOU SELL WHEN THEY DO AND BUY WHEN THEY DO ?Since you know it is manipulation . And if they always know how come they lost fortunes in the bankrupcy of stocks like GM , rode GE down 15, 20, 25 , 30 points as many Big Funds did ."
Nice close. AAPL getting its mojo back
"On March 10, 2009—the Mark Haines bottom—if you bought 1000 shares of AAPL, for $97k, and reinvested all dividends, you’d have over $4 million today"
Institutional investors don't try to time the bottom. They wait until they are sure the momentum is going higher. This stock needs to show solid gains for at least a few weeks before it really rallies.
The VIX went down about 4% last week as the S&P 500 rose slightly. I see a strong week ahead
Apple has Won a Patent for 8K Foveated Displays for a Future Mixed Reality HeadsetApple has been developing a future Mixed Reality Headset providing 8K displays. Today (2/23) the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially granted Apple a patent that relates to Apple's 8K foveated displays for a future headset.
"In this day and age, PRIVACY matters to me as a consumer and APPLE is the only company that gets my vote as a company that cares!!! One and the only reason I buy AAPL!! Facebook and Google and android phones do the opposite and I don't appreciate it........GO APPLE, GREEN OR RED!!!!"
Fed said it will keep buying bonds which means the yield will go down which means the stock market will rebound
"Biggest Dump of 2021, Inflated Bubble poised to Collapse."
"And how will the markets perform tomorrow? Regardless, hanging onto Apple long term and acquiring more on each drop."
Is AAPL stock good value ?
@Vic: You have no idea what it takes for a short squeeze .You told us there would be one on Thursday and AAPL fell over 3%.Just face it: You are terrible at understanding how stock markets function.
Lots of negative news coming out on AAPL. sure sign it will stat moving up from here.
"WTH is going on with the stock price? Cook needs to be more vocal. We are currently losing the narrative to FB, China rhetoric, etc. and its affecting the stock price."
Will close green!
"deep green tomorrow!! shorties better cover. futures are rising, Nasdaq's gained twice the amount of the DJ."
"Should close below $115 by Friday, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
when will this reach 135? so tired of the low 120's :(
This was commented on earlier this week how the last two Fridays had a $3+ pivot up and down on Friday.Why?the algorithim players!A cat playing with a mouse.
"maybe time to leave the market, as long as HF are allowed to manipulate it's hard to invest"
apple definitely going back to 135+ soon. people worry about Warren buffet sold some shares but if you really know him he never trims shares when he has negative view on a company he sells all. what he did in Q4 was simplying rebalancing. no need to panic.
Green in a red pre market what does that tell you? Anyone that shorted Apple  is getting worried.
"I sold half of my sizeable investment in Apple. My concern isn't based on any financial or broker jibberish. I have many friends and family members that have I-phones. I, for a number of months, have asked them if they are going to upgrade to the latest I-phone. Many have said No as they are satisfied with their current phone. I believe the demand to upgrade is much less than Apple experienced in the past. The smart phone has matured over time. Incremental improvements in capabilities seems to get smaller as time goes on. I still have a sizeable investment in Apple. I hope they can show continued advancements in function and capability."
Hopefully it’s not a repeat of yesterday: up on the morning and then crashes down
"I love it. Knock out some of the froth, shake out the weak hands, set a base low. Then slowly ramp into a super-cycle monster few years, draw back the weak hands and peak out in the low 200s by 2022."
You have to ask yourselves where is the stock going to be in three weeks to 3 months?￼ I think in one month the stock is over 135. What are your thoughts?￼
Rod Hall says AAPL will go under this year.I have a buy order in for 12.00
86 Pension Funds solvent and in compliance. Wonder what they’ll do with all the dough? Stocks or Bonds?
Something is cooking  woohoo 
"Yes, and where are all those longs who said $128 today....?Stock is in trouble. Nasdaq is in trouble."
I bought more AAPL . Expect 145 breakout this week. ASIA SHANGHAI HUGE TONITE. AAPL will gap up . buy more
Did you buy the dip?!? You had a golden opportunity today!!!
Soon AAPL will be acquired by GameStop 
I see a lot of diehard APPL supporters chiding bears...but guys 2 months of rally down hill is a trend to recon with. If one can never realize profit what is the point in investing?
"I bought about 1000 shares at $130 in early 2015. In the months following, my 130k investment went to 90k. Just 6 years after that initial investment, it’s now worth about $540k.The moral? Do nothing. HOLD Apple."
"10 year goes up AAPL plummets, 10 year retreats AAPL does not move."
AAPL buying back more shares and increasing the Dividend
I bought AAPL for $700 a share in 2012. That was the peak and it dropped 40%. It did not return to $700 for 2 years. 2 years of waiting to break even! I wish I didn't sell those shares. Now the same share (a little over 8 years later) has split to be worth $3375. I regret my impatience now.
Well i thought yesterday was clarification that apple was going up. Seems like I was wrong.
"Once they cant squeeze anymore out of the leisure /reopen stocks as they are priced for immediate perfection, the rotation will return to big tech with iron balance sheets, fundies & profits. The only worry longs should have is do I have enough cash to buy more?"
I have said this for a month now. Program traders will take AAPL down big along with the Nasdaq. Programs traders will upend this market
"Someday a real rain will come, and wash all the shorts off Wall St..."
Investors will soon rotate back into Apple. We’ve seen this story before
Tim Cook calling!!! Buy as much as you can right now.
Very quiet here. Amazing how fast the shift goes from value to growth. 10 year slowly dropping. Funds must be loading up at these cheap prices.
"Anyone still remember March 2020, We are going to refresh our memory, only this time the FED has no more bullets to save the market and we will truly be back to 1929 !"
"all this talk of inflation,yeilds and intrest ratesthe US government better stop poking the bear.china owns 1.07 trillion of us bonds,2nd only behind japans 1.26 trillion. you want to see bond yields skyrocket,aggravate china so much they stop buying us bonds.yeilds will be 10% in a hr."
I found an old post dated July 2009 . AAPl was at $6.25 then
Going up 5% at least today
AAPL QCOM BA TSLA are trading at bargain prices!
More smartphones were sold in the last 5 years than all previous years COMBINED. Laptop sales were up 27% in 2020 with work from home becoming permanent. Apple to $200 don’t blink.

"Trump was bragging about Dow 30,000 ?Dow 32,000 and not a peep from Biden !Markets go up & down regardless of Party !Trump himself has been on camera saying that the stock market does better under Democrat’s ?Not my words ?"
Did anyone notice if something is posted it usually happens?
Is this a record for the amount of red days in a row??
"Most people fail to realize apple always performs in the long run. Go ahead and pull up the 1 year chart, the 2 year chart, and the 10 year chart. quit worrying about short term volatility and pay attention to what matters, the long run and the massive success apple is going to have and has proven to do so."
Volume up over 147Mill. man how things changes fast
"Between 9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down at one point (44.4%) down on 4/9/13. from its all time high Steve Jobs had just died in October 2011 and Tim Cook had taken over the jobs a few months prior. Apple would not recover until Apple announced the 7 for 1 stock split in June 2014. Conclusion: Apple ran after the stock split and those who were patient were rewarded. Apple's stock gain during 2014 was 37.72%Between 2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down (32.1%) from its all time high on 5/12/2016. Conclusion: Apple started to run in the beginning parts of 2017 and rewarded stock holders with a huge 46.11% return by the end of 2017.Between 10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, Apple was down from its all time high and at one point during late December 2018 was down (38.7%).Conclusion: Those who hung on saw an epic 86.16% return in 2019.Between 2/10/2020 to about 3/16/2020, 36 days, Apple was down 31% from its all time high. The world was in panic over COVID. Then the first first stimulus came 3/23/20 and Apple recovered.Conclusion: Those who were patient were rewarded with an outstanding 82% return of Apple is 2020."
Folks markets go up and downIt’s your annual return that mattersOver the course of time markets go up Downturns like this are healthyRelax
Oversold and due for big bounce
"Apple tends to launch its tablets in Spring, and it looks like next month will see a new iPad revealed. And, surprisingly, it could be a new iPad Pro. That would be a surprise because it’s only a year since the last Pro upgrade, which saw the introduction of a LiDAR scanner and two cameras, with an updated processor. Serial leaker Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech, who has a pretty strong track record for new releases tweeted that “AirTags are still on for March” and, when quizzed about iPad Pro, said, “Also March.”The Pro will have a miniLED display. With miniLED, each pixel is individually illuminated, giving rise to deeper black hues and greater contrast levels. This is a really exciting development.Plus, it’s possible that this will come alongside a new iPad mini, which hasn’t been updated in a long time, so it may make sense to reveal the two models together. This iPad mini, rumors suggest, will have a much bigger display, 8.4in against the current 7.9in, with slimmer bezels and Touch ID."
"Hi everybody. Scroll down and you have posts on Biden, school opening and Bitcoin. This is an AAPL investor page not political or none relating subjects to APPLE. Can everyone be more focused on the intent of this page? Thank you and good returns to all AAPL Investors."
"I keep buying ,I might be wrong this week, but I won't be next year."
Apples passes Samsung has world's most popular phone. They did this without selling low end phones like Samsung. I have been long since 2013 and have yet to sell a share!
"What's wrong with this market? Apple is one of the most successful companies in the world with an excellent outlook, and not going further since weeks."
I would not be surprised if Google turns into a two thrillion dollar company by December 2021 and Apple into a three thrillion dollar company by December 2021. Right now Google is $1.375 thrillion
150 at no time
Apple chart looks like it is set up for a long term drop...
"Finally a huge pre market move for $AMWL, $AMZN $AAPL"
"There is absolutely nothing to indicate as to why Apple is down. No reason, it’s becoming really frustrating. And I am a proponent of holding Long, but there comes a time where one must make a tough decision and bite the bullet. I am not there yet but it’s very frustrating."
$1400 is enough to get you a new iPhone...just saying
AAPL major stock for the very big hedge funds. Dow flying high. AAPL SP -1.75%. Whats wrong here?

"All the shorts thought AAPL would crash this week but it stayed flat, which in this market is a victory. These daily swings will smooth out as the economy improves and AAPL will continue its rise."
Solid investment. 40% of Buffet portfolio is Apple. Just buy & hold.
"What do I mean by algorithim play?When a stock is taken down and one thinks it will pivot, these "" Algorithim players"" sell high premium puts and buy cheap calls. This is NOT for the inexperienced. I only mention this to educate everyone what is happening.Puts loose the value by 50 to 90% while the calls run 50% to sometimes as high as 1000% based on the move.These plays are best done on Friday because the weekly options have lost most of their premium with eight hours left. Yesterday that $3.50 dip at close was a see-saw effect based on this with only minutes until 1600 hrs.Last year there was a 1800% play from Feb 23 to March 26. This year there was a 1000% play here in Jan, Two moves in this time frame.Maybe next year? I do not know"
Lost $20k already with apple. What is happening with the markets?
We’ll have to wait for a long time to reach all time high of 145
Not selling
Back to $135 soon!!!
I’m long and have no complaints. Bought in between $107-$$129. We should be thankful we got out of the dreadful $120s. Who else sleeps good at night?
"long term investing no longer an option, this market is out of control, needs new rules based on reality"
This red pre-market is a good sign for a green close as was AAPL dipping at the close.Spring is almost here. It is a time for a new season here and everywhere
Apple higher highs and higher lows...and the beat goes on
The Fed is fighting runaway inflation ... and doesn't want to let u know he fked up already by printing $5-$10 trillionOil price is no longer Negative or $5 ( It's $60.00 us )10 Year Yield used to be close to ZERO ... ( it's now near 1.6% yield )US 30 Year Treasury .. yielding 2.45% United States have too much national debt right now... if yield goes out of control ... US can't pay its debt.If US can't service its debt with higher interest rate.. the Fed have to print even more $trillions to cover the problems....... which means inflation going to go out of control.On top of that ... the mortgage rates also rocket up .. forcing another HOUSING CRASHApple already crashed to nothing by then..That's when BITCOIN go to $5 million
Why I’m not excited?
Glad I sold at 142.. I’m not buying it back either
"Now that the stimulus bill has passed I hope Mr. B concentrates on social security for for the elderly and the disabled. Recalculation formula will increase payments to our beloved and wonderful and beautiful seniors and handicapped people . They are the ones who build America and they deserve better treatment. Mr. B has also promised to reverse the windfall elimination tax which affects our brave police, firemen, EMTs, Teachers etc. these people put their lives on the line for you and I and now lose at least $480 per month in S.S. Because of this awful law. Mr. B is nice very nice and he has promised to reverse it but I would love to see it done asap"
Many experts say the 2nd half of the year will be robust with high growth. Then we have the president saying maybe possibly if we are lucky there is a chance we can go to a barbecue on July 4th. No wonder the market is spooked
Look at the 2 year chart.. Apple already broken down the $135.00 support trend line.( This is a MAJOR RED FLAG )The next real support is at $108.00This $108.00 will keep apple alive for a short period.. u can make some money flipping it ... if all the horrible stories from apple doesn't change ....... the $108.00 is not going to holdU better prepare for Apple $80-$90 again
1.9 Trillion stimulus passed. Should be good for a nice bounce next week.
Maybe everybody is forgetting what a real selloff is. Like the one we had just a year ago or the 2009 meltdown. This is nothing to panic about right now.
Tech coming back!
Would be nice to get back to 129 this week which was where AAPL was Jan 4.
$750000 of my 401k in apple hope it goes back up soon haw does everyone feel about amzn which is better stock
"I understand the country is a mess with covid, but under this administration the economy will recover. Apple strong and holding."
"if you really want to make serious money on apple, do absolutely nothing with your holdings. I have been invested for 34 wonderful years."
"When a dip like this occurs with AAPL, that has nothing to do with the performance of the company which was shown to be outstanding in their last earnings report, it's just a BUYING OPPORTUNITY!"
The market is making a huge mistake throwing the Apple baby out with the bathwater...they’ll learn after another record breaking 5G supercycle qtr
"I have been selling off Apple shares every time hits highs and buying $tsla and $pltr....I think Tim Gay cook company is dead and Tsla will be next hot item to have, but I still do not know what pltr does..really. I just buy pltr because C. Wood buys it."
I feel like this stock is going to explode over $150 one of these days soon as they confirm EV partnership its going to soar its a strong buy and hold its guaranteed to go up just have to wait for it buy and forget about it
Dan Ives bullish on Apple. Short term forecast to $150.
"when does the manipulation end on apple, we have bit coin at 61,000 and apple struggles to hold a bid .. what is missing,, I hope this was the bottom, gets old watching the investment drop on nothing"
Monday $124-128
"At the end of the day Apple makes products almost every man, woman, and child in the world wants and is willing to pay a premium for.Buy it and forget it, long term it's a winner."
"Nasdaq crashed Huge, so did S&P at the end. This kind of delectable action I saw in March 2020."
I'm hearing voices telling me apple will join Tesla. In about a week you will hear these voices
with those job numbers tech should be up 400 points today
Undervalued aapl shares in Bargain prices for the next few months.
I guess you buy high. Sell low. Buy higher?
"People who complain about costs of food rising crack me up. Most people are terrible cooks and food shoppers. INFLATION? Lol. You give me $50 I can make meals for entire week, LITERALLY!"
Apple ain’t gonna make u rich quick
We will be up bigly by 11:45.
The truth is offensive to the left side of the isle
like a bouncy Ball down a stairway.
"When August will come, AAPL longs will celebrate lost year."
Apple new tech release coming next week!
"well its not selling off on inflation fears! What's the deal today?Wed, March 10, 2021, 3:22 PM^TNX-1.68%* U.S. 10-year auction shows tame results * U.S. core inflation lower than expected * U.S. 10-year note avg borrowing cost in repo market at -0.25%"
"futures markets have been lower than cash markets for weeks.nasdaq especially.we can all debate but,futures markets are 1000s of big boy conglomerates all betting cash markets go down further from here.they have been dead on for over a month."
1.56% 10yr TNote over AAPL?AAPL any day of the week
"Relax folks. AAPL will shock many, and jump up to back over $125 by the end of the day I bet. If not today, then one day soon I think. All it takes is a few big buyers. This is overdue to start it's climb back up to $140 plus soon in my opinion. I'm sure big money is watching this, and will jump in soon once they see it's settling and is not dropping any more. Patience is the key. AAPL always rewards the longs. Good luck all!"
"Well really. Gives a dollar, takes back 2 dollars. If we go dress, it’ll probably take all or most the that Gain next week :s"
"So, I got fully vaccinated for COVID-19. Two days later, I got Bitcoin fever. Went out and bought a basket full of Canadian Bitcoin mining stocks, $BFARF, $DMGGF, $HVBTF, AND $HUTMF. My problem is portfolio allocation. I own a few oil stocks, some dividend stocks (oil and reit), and a few tech. I think of $AAPL as a growth stock - 5g, 6g, and virtual space apps. But these miners could be ten baggers, look at $RIOT. So, just looking at $AAPL and the mining stocks, what percent of my remaining portfolio would you put in each? Just looking for a little common sense to offset the fever. Thanks and Good luck."
Barron’s says “Ignore the noise” so doing it! AAPL will outperform anyways! Stimulus checks to millennials are big win for AAPL!!!!
crypto will instigate the demise of the stock market
"AAPL is the stock to hold for the long haul. Everyone knows what the tangle with Facebook is about, and this will translate to Apple customer expansion and loyalty down the line"
After last 10 min on friday really don't know what to expect today. It can jump to 126 and last hour can fall to 120.
Why does a spike in treasury yields cause Techs to crumble?Thanks in advance.
"the market is in a obvious correction. zoom, nvidia and apple all had blowout earnings and each stock is way down."
This options price pegging was quite predictable.
March 20th is First Day of Spring.WE celebrate this event here.Have a great week.
"The stimulus was approved today, Monday and the whole week to the moon."
What are the chances of bond yield going to 2% and oil to $100 this year?
I see people still waiting for a lower price to get into AAPL. Typically in the past that may have been true but keep in mind things have changed within the last year with savings rates are not there anymore and the only place to be is in the market......owning stocks like AAPL MSFT etc. I think 11:00 Friday may have been bottom. Just my .02
looks like a big gaining day today$amc $aapl
I'd swear the average age of the posters on this board must be 13-14 years old.
Sad that a company like GME that was about bankrupt just matched Apple share price again. Manipulation at its finest.
"sold game stop at 345.45 yesterday. made 82 points. 100% cash now, most likely I will buy Tesla today for a 90% position."
Fingers crossed. Hopefully we do well tomorrow! Good luck to all.
Of course Buffet sold Apple. He had to . He had major losses in the airline industry .. so he had to sell his most profitable position so his share holders wouldn’t lose . He just took some profit .. like everyone does. Sell your shares and walk away. Have a great day . The rest of the smart money will stay and hold. We will be just fine
"Oh my God article in Benzinga by Shanthi Rexaline “why Apple will hit a $3 Trillion market cap by the end of 2021”. Article was dated February 22, 2021"
"You can buy apple end of March at $104,wait for 12 months and sell at $125. That's nice 20% profit. Or you can buy today one of the Airlines, sell on friday for 15% profit."
Keep Holding hahahahaha
New iMacs this year will lift Apple to new highs. Strongest buy.
Ok guys ive been memeing in my past posts truth is im also an aapl bagholder. My cost basis is at 126.5 so im glad were up.
Up 2.97 cents at the close. I am not happy at this rate It will take till Wednesday to get enough scratch to buy my new Gibson Les Paul. I demand action here.
Apple will announce EV partnership in 3-6 months. Can see this trading at 175+ after
Enough of the political posts! For crying out loud haven’t we had enough of this BS on the board? Let’s talk Apple  and price targets and upgrades.
"APPL reiterated Outperform rating and a price target of $175 at WedbushWedbush analyst Daniel Ives notes that Apple's stock has taken a breather since its ""jaw dropping"" performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, the analyst views this as a short-term blip in the stock's upward trajectory as his Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength he is seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, Ives believes Apple will hit $3T in market cap by year-end. Importantly, with his estimation that 350M of 950M iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, the analyst thinks this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for the company. He also believes there is an upward shift of ASPs for iPhones in this cycle as the iPhone Pro continues to be the predominant model sold globally, which bodes well for top-line numbers heading into the March and June quarters. He has an Outperform rating and a price target of $175 on the shares."
Apple is and will always be a long term investment. Be patient and you will be rewarded
"We have funds and institutions day trading...few days chasing banks, industrial energy and materials. Then exit and back to tech again. This is the highlight for the last few weeks. Fundamentals will prevail. This scare tactics will not work...stay strong"
"I'm the schmuk that bought Apple at $144.50 and added to my shares at $130, $123..... It's been a difficult month."
"Another big fund bought More of Apple today. This week a couple of upgrades with price being raised. Last week and this week huge purchases by a Norway, Denmark and Canadian (Ontario)Fund and then last week Warren resumed purchasing Apple."
"This week was also a valuable lesson. The stock price was ""Muscled"" higher. After printing $127+ it nosedived back to $120. WE were hoping for a third print of one of the two open trends in the $130""s and not seeing the two prints of $120 as an intra day low. It printed $120 as an intra day low on Thursday.This is AAPL's nature. Oh well! It will print $130+'s soonIt was posted when people asked to sell 50% of options after they ran 100%. In most cases they had run 200%. Also, we suggested to close out the sale of puts after they lost 50% of premium.I hope no one got hurt."
I am a student for 12 years of AAPL's trading and I am still amazed at it's reliability
"oversold by a large margin, look at the technicals. good time to buy. NASDAQ won't keep falling like this"
"volume is down by over 20% for last week and a half. you people dont understand the word ""oversold"". this is under-bought."
Imagine if we had a button to press to clear out any “sponsored post” or posts written in all caps claiming it’s the end times. 
I plan on holding my Apple  shares for a few more years so I’m not upset.$$$$
COOK DO SOMETHING TO THE FALTERING STOCK RATHER THAN SLEEPING ON THE JOB.
"i mean, do you think that's retail who at the low of the day starts dumping 150k shares one candle after another?"
Needs to close over 100 day moving average of $125.29. To be safe $125.50
"The Volume is off 20% , something's up with it"
"The chairman of Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn says the electronics giant is considering making electric vehicles at its mostly empty worksite in Wisconsin, where the company originally planned to make LCD panels. Either that, or Foxconn may make EVs in Mexico. The decision will be made by July 1st, chairman Young Liu said at a press conference Tuesday."
going to buy 1000 shares at the bell. What a great deal.
We need 140 this Friday ....come on aapl ...let’s skyrocket now ...
3000 migrant teenage boys being sent to Dallas to be housed in convention center for 90 days. Then being sent to towns all over US. Border towns being over run many with Covid. Now estimate 600 kids coming across every night. Biden signed executive order that all unaccompanied children must be allowed to stay. This has caused Hugh surge at border now Biden basically ignoring problems this has caused. CNN ignoring to protect Biden.
also watch out for share buybacks and apple car surge with boos stock drastically.
CNN still ignoring crisis at border. Take about bad journalism.
The climb to 150 has begun lads
DOW 35.000 BY APRIL?
Funny that bears hate on apples PE ratio. There are stock in this market with a PE over 1000 That Never earned a dime but yeah apple is overvalued!
I think this is the week traders come back into Apple
what an opportunity for APPLE to buy back shares at these levels.
My March purchases are in the money
AAPL has devalued about -18% so far this month! Fire sale!
You have to understand I am sure apple is working on something huge. Buy or you will say I should have guessed they are. Could see a huge spike in there shares. Go apple
It’s funny. When apple was over $140 and the market was clicking on all cylinders I was probably 60-70% in cash waiting for a market pullback. I’ve slowly bought on the dips and today I’m fully invested. It’s impossible to time the bottom but I like to buy in stages. So why am I frustrated that this is down to $116. When it was $140 I hoped for it but know I’m like how much further will it go down. But once I gather my emotions I realize that this dip buying will be very profitable in the coming months. You just have to be patient which some of us struggle with. I also bought shares in some former high flyers like tsla etsy snap roku Airbnb Uber amazon and I think most of these will also rebound to new highs later this year. The key is keep a list and buy on the dips and don’t let emotions guide your decisions.
"I think ""GIUSEPPE"" is like Nostradamus !! NEVER predicts ANYTHING good !!! Does anything good happen Bro ??"
"To everyone who’s frustrated. I checked again. Institutions have begun buying apple stock again! We should start to see this go up hopefully next week. Like today, EP wealth bought $120M worth of apple shares. Lots of buying and just one or two institutions sold.Stay strong!!Before anyone asks - I checked on marketbeat :)"
COOK: investors and employees are disappointed in your management and stock performance. Either give back your bonus or resign. Silence is not an option
Apple always comes back. Always. That’s why it’s Buffett’s top holding. Never sell this stock!!!
"Market sell off. Most everything, especially tech stocks are taking a hit. We’ll be back. The only thing you can do now that makes sense, buy more. Apple will move, this is just a breather."
"guess where the 1400 checks will go , you cant live without apple products"
"apple's first consecutive 3 up days in a row, for several months. now they have to hold the gain."
"These times come and go.IF I wanted to buy now I would not but sell a Jan put for $20+. If stock dips further, you get to buy the stock at anther $20 discount"
"SamSpade, you didn't go to college, did you?The Democratic Party is leftist. The communists were (are) leftists.Republicans and Libertarians on the other hand believe in small government.Small government cannot be authoritarian. Authoritarians don't strive to reduce the power of government in the lives of the citizenry.Leftists do that.Can you follow this?It's not that complicated."
126.50 by the end of the week or Tim Cook is going to rain down on the shorts
All those buy the dip/drop people have been wrong since earnings. Why on earth would anyone believe a word from them today?
"In Frankfurt the current price is $127.50. Hope, today it will reach $130 in US!"
TOLD YOU YESTERDAY AND FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS TO STAY AWAY FROM AAPL. WILL GO TO $.100
"I bought some Apple stock with a cost basis of 124 just as Apple announced their new M1 chip and right before the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays. I was thinking the ""stars were aligning"" for Apple stock price to rock it upward. Boy, what was I thinking (rhetorical question) ?? THIS IS WHAT I CALL A ""yo-yo"" stock. Just like playing with a simple yo-yo. Up and down and up and down. Tired of this BS."
I believe in the law and the Constitution. I don’t like any radical group like Q’s.
People that are saying apple is overvalued is a joke compared to other companies. Why aren’t you on Tesla or other companies who’s valuations are purely based on speculation of what’s yet to come. Yet apple is a company that is printing money and is a good play long term
Top analysts all agree AAPL is way over sold! Apples RSI is between 30-35 which definitely confirms this! I'm loading up to average as the big boys are coming in!
"So lemme get this straight.... Facebook publicly admits Apple has it by the short hairs, Buffett signals that Apple is still Berkshire’s prize holding by a long shot, the company destroys all earnings records, the stimulus train is still running full steam, and there are totally new offerings (airtags, glasses, cars) on the imminent horizon..... and you’re selling this stock because....you hate minting money?"
The only way stock goes up is when more people are buying instead of selling. Why not do a concerted effort by all and buy as many shares as possible at this discounted price. Keep the shares as long as possible and then little by little sell them at a higher price. Much better than complaining every day that its going down.
March event is nearly . VR demo . New IPhone . And its only March . How great can be 2023 for Apple ? Overvalued ? This is not Tesla ! They got products and massive sells
Anyone own over 20% Apple in their portfolio? I am thinking of loading up the week.
Why is Apple as interest rate sensitive as they seem to be? They have issued some bonds and incurred some debt during the cheap money era of the last couple years. But given their huge cash position relative to a lot of other tech names with much more debt to cash why do they march in lock step with them when rates pop.
156M shrs + 27 M shrs AH in tight range _ what gives?
"does anyone get tired of hearing how great the stock is but it is always dropping, lets see 143 to 120,, nothing bullish here yet"
"Yes, Apple will increase their dividend during their Q1 earnings.....as they do every year and WILL do every year for the next 25+ years. It’s one of MANY reasons that holding Apple = winning."
Most posts here extremely bearish—means it’s time to buy.
"Wallstreet wants to offload the overpriced growth stocks like TSLA, AAPL, SQ, NVDA but they don't want to sell them cheap and that is why they manipulate the market; 1 day up and 3 days down and all these stocks trending down. do not be fooled"
"Buy tomorrow!! People are gonna have cash and will want to put it somewhere, no better stock than Apple. Over 200 at the end of the year! We will get at least back to $126 tomorrow"
10 year bond yield is in the RED now. Not by much but at least it’s dropping. Hopefully we will have a better day tomorrow if not soon
To anyone who’s recently invested in this stock: don’t worry!! Don’t look at the market everyday. Apple is not supposed to rally every single day!! This was a bad month!! Hopefully March will be better :)
Stop trading apple. Don’t buy it or sell it. Eventually the funds will get the message we are not playing their games. Obvious manipulation taking place.
Let me tell you a secret. Please keep it to yourself. Warren Buffett has resumed buying Apple stocks
Cancel your Apple Sell orders people this is going over $130 within 48 hours
Long Term outlook wins with APPLE!
US stock market always MOVES AHEAD ... they see run away inflation and rising interest rates.Now you asking your self why the US stock market keeps going down now ??? 1 step forward .. 3 steps backThe Market is dumping stocks .. due to valuation being too high and no fantastic growth going forward... also the imminent rise of interest rates yield. The only way to stop this rising yield .. u need Powell to come out and announced a gigantic QE and hinting a Yield Curve Control. Instead Powell said he's comfortable with the way things is right now and he's in no hurry of doing any tapering or raising interest rates.If that's the answer from the Fed.. Apple is heading much lower from here
Which phone manufacturer would most benefit from $OPTI patent? $AAPL $GOOG $SSNLF ? Should OPTI grant exclusivity to any one or similar licensing agreement to any one interested?
"Folks, buy Apple and just hold. I invested $150K back in 2016 and now it's worth over $700K. That is just in my long shares. Don't pay attention to anyone on these comment boards."
Hope some miracle happens to get this to 150 ...
$130 here we come 
"the main reason I sold all my shares today in pre market was, I asked tim cook to do a reverse split to 8.3 billion shares outstanding float. that would of been a 1 to 2 reverse split. he was not interested in changing. regardless apple's future is tremendous. you will be pleasantly surprised on what's coming next. good luck to everyone on their investment performance."
"dont be fooled yet.looks like the turn around wont start until april.theres still alot of pain for tech.FAANG MAY STALL AROUND THESE LEVELS,but others with ultra high p/e or no profits will feel the pain as yeilds rise.The market will mellow when rates steady but moves of 2-5% either way kills certainty.the thing the market hates the most is uncertainty.gradual moves ok.the market is now trying to force the fed to raise intrest rates or buy more bonds.either move will steady bond yields.its a game of chicken.the market has the power to force the fed to make a move because volitile bond yeild moves not only crushes the market,it costs the fed more to service the ever growing debt.The fed needs to steady yields or raise intrest rates or the curve gets to big and the difference between what the fed takes in from lending money and what they pay to burrow money gets out of control.the market will win but the pain until then may be brutal.DONT BE FOOLED,sp are on sale compared to their highs of a few months ago,but those highs were caused by having no where else to make money.Every stock is expensive now.even beaten ones like oil,airline,hotels etc.dont forget these companies took on massive debt and issued alot of shares which watered down stock.SP are misleading now.most of these companies that still look cheap actually have higher market caps now"
My guess is it is going to end at 124.7
140+ by end of March!
It must be tough for Apple to have constant pressure to increase the share price.
"Look at this week's historical prices;Feb 26, 2021 122.59 124.85 121.20 121.26 121.26 164,320,000Feb 25, 2021 124.68 126.46 120.54 120.99 120.99 147,306,500Feb 24, 2021 124.94 125.56 122.23 125.35 125.35 110,691,500Feb 23, 2021 123.76 126.71 118.39 125.86 125.86 157,859,10The move from Feb 23 low at 5118.39 to Feb 24 high at $126.46 was an algorithim home run.Then Feb 25 low of $120.54 to Feb 26 at $124,85 was another.Both were suggested here real time based on historical prices and AAPL's nature.On Thursday it was posted about a possible $125 close, AAPL hit $124,85. then a few rogue players took it down $3.50. Was this simply a set-up for Monday? Before this happen we warned to take profits on Feb 26 options; didn't we? Why? Because this has happen before."
Mark Cuban and Bill Ackman just loaded up AAPL today!️️️
"Lordy Lordy Lordy next week close to $600 billion will enter the market. Yes siri bob some of it go to bonds but most of it I sayet h over 95% goes to stocks and oh boy oh boy we the Babbas are waiting with excitment for the big pop up in the market. Suffice to sayeth we will see Dow 50,000 at year end, NASDAQ 24,000 at year end and S&P 6,500 at year end the year of our Lord 2021. Thanko"
"Glad we got this expected correction out of the way.....5G supercycle just starting. Kuo: AR headset mid 2022, Apple Car etc....the next best products are ready to be delivered."
I bought yesterday at 120 but expect some more down. I was hoping leaving it overnight would exert some upward pressure with after hours trading. But the trend was still down when I bought
$123 on Monday.....said about a billion times since it’s been below $123. A trillion times said since earnings?....”higher on Monday”. None have panned out true.
"People always find a reason to say Apple is done, they are always wrong. Im averaged down to 120 and I am feeling the profits already"
" GOLDMAN SACHS: ""We have raised our GDP forecast to reflect the latest fiscal policy news and now expect 8% growth in 2021 (Q4/Q4) and an unemployment rate of 4% at end-2021—the lowest among consensus forecasts—that falls to 3.5% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023."""
"Remember:1) Buffet still has a lot of stake in Apple.2) he sold some last quarter also and everyone was worried back then too.3) we’ll be fine soon :)4) this should start climbing up sometime mid March and early April (before the next Earnings call)5) it’s a financially stable, profit making company. Go study their balance sheet and you’ll feel better."
"I think, soon $AAPL price will be reach to 182$! I’m in long too!"
Virus stimulation of $1400=$1200 iPhone 12 and Chipotle for a week
"Sorry to tell you folks this but Apple will be a very red stock this year. So if you didn't sell it in January, it'll be 2022 before you see those numbers again if lucky. Between Apple and Tesla, it's a race to see who goes farther red by December."

"This pullback is almost as big as the collapse last year, except over a month instead of a few days. If such a drop made this a bargain back then, then it's also a bargain now."
"Long holder since 2008 & I’ve seen this activity many times. Just hold. Apple is solid & always comes back, higher"
Pretty tough to move 16 billion shares up. Just ask GE shareholders with 8 billion shares. They're doing an 8 for 1 reverse split to move the price up. Welcome to reality people.
"To AAPL longs,, do you remember when you became confident in your investment and didn't care about market fluctuations ?Encouragement for short-term holder."
"With spring approaching and covid cases dropping, the market will selloff high p/e stocks which benefited from the pandemic."
It is absurd that a 10 year bond yield rise 5% automatically causes the machines to sell. Market ran by GD machines.
"In this tougher and more closely analyzed tech market, AAPL is rising above, like cream to the top, as it should. Expect more to come..."
"If you read the Wall Street Journal, Barrons or any other financial paper, all the institutional investors, fund managers and analysts are saying the same thing. Money is rotating out of growth tech and into cyclicals and value stocks right now. It’s not gonna shift back to tech overnight because of the stimulus package. This is how the game is played. When will the rotation back into the FAANG stocks happen? I don’t know but it will sooner or later. Just not tomorrow"
Can’t wait to see the shorts get their rear end holes ripped out real soon. $145.00 is coming.
Monday we crash to 110 you bagholders!
Double the 10 day average volume and closed almost green. Sleep well longs
The stock futures weak. Bounces are getting smaller and short-lived.Use any bounce to lighten up or go short.
"I get the sell-off on the ridiculous...like... $TSLA , but $AAPL $AMZN $FB and $GOOGL are buys on the weakness. Also...smart to allocate 3-5 percent in Bitcoin. The discount available on $GBTC is attractive. Lots of stimulus dollars moving to Bitcoin. I'll sit on $GBTC thru 100, 200, 300 and beyond."
"“Typical March trading comes in like a lion and out like a lamb with strength during the first few trading days followed by choppy to lower trading until mid-month when the market tends to rebound higher,” Hirsch writes.March also sees “triple witching: occur on the third Friday, when stock options, stock-index futures and stock-index option contracts expire simultaneously.Ultimately, seasonal trends suggest that March will be wobbly and could be used as an excuse for further selling, but on that downturn may be cathartic and give way to further gains in the spring.“Further consolidation is likely in March, but we expect the market to find support shortly and subsequently challenge the recent highs again,” writes Hirsch, noting that April is statistically the best month of the year."
AAPL is a Steal at 116x. Been Accumulating on Dips. Operators & Shorties will go Bankrupt when it bounces steeply on Monday. Mark my words..
140+ by end of March. Apple is unstoppable!
There is soooo much potential with Apple and this is a good price point. I have been with Apple since 1976. They are sooo tight lipped when it comes to new products. They are not going backwards with their corporate strategy. They will look for the most lucrative markets and act upon it.
"Bloomberg: Apple has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years and Apple has developed on its own most of the necessary software, underlying processors and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for such a sophisticated system...."
Pin at 120 as expected. Let's get through tomorrow and perhaps next week we'll see some improvement. I think this is more options manipulation than the treasury yields
"Buy the dip and hold long before it goes above $130. The position is when you are one the earliest buyers, where you are so deep that you don’t have to worry about small pullbacks anymore."
"Please help: Why the the 10 years Treasury go up to a new all time high? Thought the message from Powell would push Nasdaq and Co. Yesterday evening was slightly green, now the procedere as the last weeks? Do think it will go down more?"
Bought some more AAPL today to lower my cost basis. This price is a gift! Good luck all!
I have lost total confidence in the highflying stocks. we are in a bear market.
ready to buy $117
looks like FED is at it again with negative remarks ... since they started at 2pm mkt has been falling. stay long!
Last two Fridays closed at $121+
Should open $125 plus Monday!
Sold all my TSLA and am 90% in Apple now. The PE is so low for this giant who is about to take the full VR market and it's ad and referral revenue as a new revenue stream not to mention EVs too
Notice the timing of the news of slowing Iphone sales. This news was put out by the short selling manipulators trying to crash the stock market again. The timing is shady as hell. Just as AAPL stock was recovering they put out another hit piece even though last quarter was record.
Lots of premarket buying... apple never drops below 120 again!
This morning maybe another opportunity to buy. Afternoon everything could soar after fed meeting
Apple is one of the few Tech stocks with great dividend policy. Pays much more than MM while you wait for bounce back.
I honestly think we are blaming apple too much. they delivered a blowout quarter. it is the market conditions that are not working now. no stock is seriously safe short term.
"Dan Ives on Apple, “golden buying opportunity”!"
"Similar price action last year and guess what. It rallied afterwards. Let the weak hands sell out, that's your opportunity to buy the shares at a discount. Stay strong, stay focused and go long. Nothing to panic about. Apple's business and fundamentals are still strong. The current market events have nothing to do with Apple's products or its business. Looking forward to the dividend raise in May."
we love ge .... sell this lead balloon Appl .....
"We go through this year over! You can’t beat the market nor time it! All that matters is the long term vision and time in the market. How would you like your family to have $10,000,000 in equity in one of the best companies America has to offer. Just live off the dividends. Money in the bank. Why worry about trying to get in and out. You going to miss this rocket ship. Got to think about taxes also. Long term gains are best."
This is pretty incredible. Since earnings Apple has been down almost every day for six straight weeks from 145 to 117. That’s about 19.5%. Getting close to the 115 support level
 Apple will all of a sudden breakout over $10-$20 a share in one day with an announcement and all you beeches will come running back
The market risk factor seems to have tripled over the past week. Elections have consequences.
"It's time for AAPL to raise their Dividend to 2.5/3.0 percent. They are making money hand over fist and the long term shareholders need a legitimate boost to their sinking share price, Enough of the buy backs that only sink the share price. Their new phone is going to outsell all of their iPhone 12's by a wide margin."
"Apple is experiencing what I’ll call a six month “super base.” As they say, “The bigger the base, the higher in space.” Blastoff will occur soon!"
Green ! :-)
"If you sell, you lose and pay capital gains tax."
What's the word for tomorrow?
"Don't let these TV messengers talk you into selling. Believe me, everyone is itching to jump on this. The reopening stocks have just about hit tops and they are trying to get Apple dirt cheap. I think we are sitting on bottom."
"A moral victory considering we were down over three at one point. We are overdue for some specific company news. That is what will drive this over $130.00. The Bears? Short term they can have their fun, but long term there has, and will be few surer things in life than Apple."
"At least the quality stocks are up. GME, AMC, AAL."
"These are small hills compared to $HCMCAnd it is also fake, false not true.4B vol out? thats very small.compared to $HCMC. 400B Out and almost full.saturation. Any predictions on what a stock with 400 Billion vol capped out would do.sum it up.$HCMC has more stock sold than all top 30 here combined. x times 3.In my honest opinion. HCMC will become the biggest player. n the cannibis market, making.licensing deals around the world.The World needs a HERO!!!!THAT HERO ARRIVED.I NOMINATE $HCMC TO BE THE NEW WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.just an idea.Imagine if you guys had startes.these.30 companies.as intelligwntly as HCMC. $HCMC100% Bulls.running ir. If Doge is the peoples ceypto$HCMC is the peoples OTC.UNITED WE ROCK, AND ROLL IN CASHWe will NOT divide!Shareholders of $hcmc, have the #1 new and upcoming CEO. One day a legend."
"Federal reserve will not destroy the stock market, rates will be stable for now. No need to jump off tech! AAPL will be up up up this afternoon! See you at 200 by end of this year!"
Thanks President Bernie Sanders and Vice President AOC! Maybe the stock market will recover in 2024.
"it's funny, when this stock is at 140s, everyone was buying...now its 120, suddenly people get scared, nothing fundamentally changed, and simple as it is: 120 is cheaper than 140..."
Can the bond going up push Apple to their historical PE of sub 15? That would be like $50 per share.
"It's nice to know that Warren Buffett is an Apple cheerleader but I don't think that's going to be a catalyst for Apple stock. Buffett doesn't have the pull that he used to have because he's made a few mistakes on some big purchases. Cathie Wood has easily topped Buffett in stock picks and runs her fund to make big money in a hurry. She dumps non-performing companies in a heartbeat. Companies need younger cheerleaders who are willing to tweet every day to pull in greedy investors looking to make a quick buck. Gene Munster doesn't have what it takes as he's more like a broken record when he talks about Apple and almost no one listens. Top fund managers and CEOs use social media to pump their stocks day in and day out. All Tim Cook talks about is privacy and big investors find that topic as boring as heck. Privacy doesn't make money for Apple but causes a ton of trouble in the news media.Oh well, it's a new month and Apple has some new products on the way that should be in high demand. Apple will likely have another decent quarter coming up. Fingers crossed."
"In the end, AAPL longs will win. We always have. Even under Obama, when AAPL multiplied 10 fold"
"I live in San Francisco. If a homeowner wants to fly the American flag he’s risking persecution, his personal liberties and destruction of his property. That’s the truth."
I find $AAPL to still be overvalued. I’m looking for some good deals but I’m just not motivated to buy $AAPL at these levels. The risk/reward just isn’t balanced.
Stock can’t catch a break. Down after hours. Futures down. This all spells bear market. Sorry. Nasdaq is getting CRUSHED and I see nothing on the horizon to stop it. Problem is this could be $115 very quick. A LONG way away from called $150 just 4 weeks ago.
Apple stock price locked up at $120-$121 for option expiration today.Apple will go sky diving again next week.
I started investing in April since July 2020. It always drops and then jumps even higher :) I’ve seen it 4 times. It’s a little longer this time but it’s similar to the time it dropped in september / October 2021. Everyone back then said apple is finished. But you know what? It’s not. It’s making a lot of products. Lots of revenue. Lots of cash! They can even but a few islands and start an apple resort  so sit back and relax. We’ll be fine by mid March :) earnings also coming up soon
Don't sell anything. The fear mongers are always out trying to get you to sell your shares every time the stock price drops. Selling has always been a big mistake that every apple investor has lived to regret and the same will be the case this time if you sell.
Cramer also tweeted today that he believes the tech whoosh was yesterday and that was the bottom
Apple can buyback a boatload of shares!....just keep pushing up eps and lowering market cap at the same time......and the beat goes on
"Biden wheres the green new deal im losing money on Green energy, glad i have 50% in Oil thats skyrocketing... buying apple in 1-2 days"
It’s been this way for a long time. Democrats view illegals as voters for the party .
Apples Quarter Financials higher than predicted $140 here we come 
"Talked to my accountant yesterday...He said, ""...with everyone getting $1,400 for doing nothing every few months you don't think we're not going have inflation??? We'll be lucky if we don't end up in the ditch..."""
"let’s see, has Apple ever produced a poor product? And it’s now planning to manufacture an EV, loaded w/AAPL technology, no doubt autonomous at some point. And it’s dropping every day in this market. Guess I’m not too bright, ‘cause this makes absolutely no sense."
Tony Sacconaghi not giving any love to apple right now on CNBC. I think it looks attractive at this level but who knows. He thinks multiple is still too high.
AAPL will gain over these months as economy reopens. A solid holder.
Never bet against AAPL - get a great buy while you still can! Multiple revenue streams plus AR and CAR to come!
Facebook is up as they want to spy people haha and Apple is doing good job on your privacy and it’s On red  it’s piure manipulation so don’t worry all it’s will be on the moon soon
Markets will be up in an hour or two. So load up the truck! Will be over 125 USD by eod!
never will i invest in apple again. how do you like that tim
"My current portfolio: APPL, VIAC, SNAP, DKNG, PLTR Apple is the #1 stock, VIAC is the #1 hottest stock, SNAP is the #1 app for kids $13-$34, Draft Kings is the #1 brand name and first mover in a huge potential sports betting sector, Palantir is #1 best big data AI based software and a future multi bagger!"
Longs pls lock your shares from allowing shorts to borrow your stock for manipulation. You can do it by putting in a sell order for $140+
"Even if Apple drops to $106, it will still be up 100% since March 2020."
"I think the old saying is true that when everyone is selling a good company, you want to be a buyer. I added to position last Friday $120+. Will add more if it drops below $105. Good long term holding."
A 2 Trillion $ Market cap company share move 2 cents when the dow is up 300 points!
Guys.... I'll be using my $1400 stimulus check on buying 12 shares of Apple. I plan to hold for 20 years. Hopefully it will be a good start for my son's future.
Big Div increase announcedHere we go
"I think it’s about time for Tim Apple to say something... in my opinion, you split the stock price in order to attract the average investors, but now the average investors, like myself, are bleeding inside. The big guys are stealing our shares because we cannot afford to hold any longer. Maybe next time you need to change your language by saying you are splitting the shares for the rich to get richer. Just my 2 cents..."
Stimulus bill passed and more than expected jobs in Feb.. Next week is going to be awesome week. Stay tuned .
"apple correction during last year's crash in March was 30%, currently 20%."
Should fall under $120 quickly today toward close and test $110 or below next week.
"All I can say is wow. All weekend I was excited thinking this week is the week and I just now looked at the share price. I was expecting green and up maybe 1-3%. NOPE. It’s Aapl we’re talking about. It’s red and down a quarter %. But wait guys, I know, in 10 years, I’ll be thankful and most likely dead."
Gas prices going up all over America doesn’t just effect the gas and oil industry everything in stores from bread to phones will be raised. Shipping from ups and fedex will go up and plane tickets will be more expensive this is the chain reaction of trying to go all electric your 600 dollar stimulus check is just going to cover the increase your going to pay for gas for the year
On the way to 150 by Friday
"Higher taxes, higher gas prices, higher unemployment, massive influx of illegals at the border oh yeah great plan."
We need a ground breaking new product announcement. Cmon Apple! ️
Paul is right. The Stimulus will pay for itself. Just like the Tax Cuts
Yuge news tomorrow. Power hour is upon us.
"Don’t forget, besides the $1.9T, there’s an unspent $1T remaining from the Response and Relief Act that was passed in December. A Tsunami of Cash will hit soon. Cha-Ching!"
this is the best market of all time. acting perfectly. 76 % in apple now.
"This is manipulation...and I don't know why the Apple corporate doesn't do anything to prevent this....they can release some news, make tweet, something....but they just seem to allow such manipulation"
iCar announcement coming sooooon.
"Apple is the Biggest and Best Company on Earth, The World's Darling for Decades to come, Load up !"
"Been investing for over 20 years. Been on these boards daily for probably about 5. One thing is for certain - never have I seen such strong “in the moment” sentiment as I see now. Everyone assumes that what they are seeing or feeling now will last in perpetuity. That’s patently FALSE. Want proof, just go back and review what your life and society were like 5, 10, or 20 years ago.Don’t know about you all, but just because the VCR is eating up my tape today doesn’t mean I won’t be easy streaming in 8k in due time."
High volume
"15 minutes before the close, I sold April covered calls in QS and used to money to buy calls in $AAPL, $MSFT, $CRM, $DIS on the weekly in case we get a reversal tomorrow. Little play for fun with free cash from the covered call."
"Did ""everyone "" profit?Was anyone hurt?Let's take a stroll down memory lane from Jan 1, 2021.While AAPL was rallying , We posted that AAPL was ""rich"" and to use the Da Vinci Strategy. Earlier discussion recap that. People whom, bought the stock and did not are down 15%. I think the next earnings report will get them there in April 29.If WE ""muscle"" the stock it is senseless. More people will get hurt and Wall Street richer.When AAP dipped, we posted to sell high premium puts rather than buy the stock. Much discussion has already been had on that.The ""algorithim play""? Sometimes it is obvious after two trends but once in awhile it is not. It can go great or awfully wrong. However, it has been a very profitable tool."
Love this steady spiking chart! Step by step
aapl is controlled by Peking... so you stockholders should see that.... this stock is losing money for almost a year now.... see for yourself... remember it's not how much money they made it's how much money they will make.....
How are you all doing today my fellow longs?
I just bought more. Can’t let go without buying dips here. Volume picking up higher.
Where are the shorties?
"COOK NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING TO THE STOCK. SLEEPING, NO GOOD NEWS, WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO THE STOCK. COOK RESIGN IF YOU CAN NOT TURN AROUND THE STOCK"
Still chasing out some weak hands before back to highs and then $160’s plus. Same movie we saw past decades before heading up.Stay
Sell.Sell now and think later.Something is seriously wrong with this stock.The rest of the market is doing better than this stock!
"I had an issue with airpod pro yesterday, called in for a support they shipped the replacement on the same date. Today, I received my replacement airpod and listening music. I bought more shares today."
Apple is like the tortoise in the race. Always lagging behind when the market is green. Really tests your patience
aapl will be 200 dollars in 3 months.
My buy order isn’t going to get filled at 119$ today.
Apple is unbreakable! A few bucks down here means nothing! Toxic bears and shorts will learn it the hard way when our baby hits 150 USD in a few weeks. Stay tuned!
Just stay long!
"""my stock is down today, it doesn't matter that other stocks are green it still means the stock market is crashing and it's Bidens fault! he's been on the job for 5 minutes, everything bad in my life is his fault!"" - cry babies"
Positioned to be another green day for AAPL! gg longs
I have been holding AAPL for over 9 years now. I only need 3 likes to get to 1k! Thumbs up pls! :)
"Keep in mind, those that bought a year ago when the market tanked have substantial gains, many over 100%. It would be prudent for those to take money off the table, especially if they held over a year for long term gains. Right now the risk/reward ratio is too high, even with the influx of BORROWED money."
"GameStop up +21 points today @ 281. Hey, wait a minute...what about the 10 yr yield ??!! What a joke."
All stocks will be cut in half when rates hit 6% on the 30 year treasury. We now have someone in charge of the country who couldn't get a security clearance or a driver's license due to 2 brain surgeries.
I still find it so hard to believe that some companies are worth over $200 when they don’t even make any profit  or sometimes even half of what apples revenue is 
"well, not as strong as yesterday but I'll bet green at 1pm.. any other guesses??"
"Nasdaq futures from being up 82, to now down 7 ."
I’m fine with the price drop because I’m not selling any time soon. If it drops low enough I’ll add more. This is a great company with great long term outlook. Peaks and valleys my friends.
"A little PerspectiveStupid WS is hyper concerned about 10YR bond yield and how this is “the end” of equities! But if you examine the historic bond yield since 2013 you will notice we are relatively low. Aug 2013 the 10 yr was at 2.78 , Nov 2016 at 2.15, Dec 2018 at 2.89, Apr 2019 at 2.56, Dec 2019 at 1.80 and now March 18 at 1.74. So did the stock market crash the last 8 years when the yield was considerably higher than now? No. Did people stop inviting in equities? No. So, by examining this historic fact, you can see that today’s reaction to rising yields is a complete over reaction to normal fluctuations in the bond yield. The 10 year is historically still very low. I would expect this reaction if we were looking at the yields from the 1980’s when the 10 yr was approaching 18% !"
The Nasdaq isn't crashing like last few weeks. Last chance to get AAPL cheap.
"This re-opening trade and the bond yields is so OVER done! this is not going to end well, when the tide turns. Look at the airlines and how much they have moved in just the past 4 weeks, not normal. Apple, Amazon and Tesla are steals at the current prices, bottom line 12 months from now, they will all be this might not be the bottom, you can not get hurt at these prices if you are going to hold."
"keeping my 1820 shares for ever.I do not care about this short term price swings.I have seen it many times in the past and it always rebound and come back strong.if apple share did not split in 2014 (7:1) and in 2020 (4:1), the price share would have been over 3500.so relax and enjoy ur day"
"high volume sell off today. I have never seen the Dow Jones make a all time high, while the Nasdaq composite is in a correction, and the high fliers in a severe bear market. today is notable."
"Stimulus checks are going straight to the stock market, new iPhone and other Apple products."
Bears are partying when i see clear and strong signs of climax selling in week 3-4 of this sell off the last several days. This is bullish if you are an investor who wanted speculation out of this market. Many many small and mid caps down 50-60% and many big tech down 15-30%.

If you are waiting for the bottom to drop out on this you will be disappointed. This isn’t some fly by night company here. When has Apple not came back and made highs? It always does
"When AAPL dipped to $119+ this am, all March 12 puts below $121 closed at zero. Sale of the Puts above $121 had a modest profitThe calls after this dip had a modest return (50%+) but a return nevertheless.These ""algorithm players"" are very good at what they do."
"CNBC ticker tape “futures point to a strong open on Monday “. Like I have been saying between $360 billion to close to $700 billions will be invested in the market from the stimulus package of $1.9 thrillion. The state , the state agencies and the pension funds will go right into the stock market because these will be long term investments. Only bills currently due will go into bonds and other liquid assets and that could be around 5.00%. Second of the individuals who are getting $1,400 per person about 50% will go into the market this according to the study I read last week or so. The +25 years generations who are taking us to the moon once again and to Mars and Jupiter are very very smart and are beginning to think of their future. Rest of the 50% or so will go into purchasing and or updating their I-Phones etc. Had you and I invested $1,000 with Warren Buffett in 1959 we would be worth millions upon millions of dollars today some say as high as 79.0 millions after all his yearly return has been an average of 23.3% since 1959. The biggest stupid person on this board is me/I. I should have started investing earlier and I learnt my lesson never to short or day trade the market."

Hope you all had fun today. Tomorrow is back to reality.
Will go up as usual and tank.
Viacom is the new leader on wall street like Disney. I think the problem is that the fangs have peaked already like 2000.
Prediction for tomorrow is a tough one. I will call that AAPL will be up but no more than .80 cents. Added to the first 2 days of the week I’ll take that gladly.
1. I think it’s Buffett selling2. I think Apple will be a lot higher in time

"Fast Company's Mark Sullivan and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman are among several sources who have reported that Apple is working on its own modem for future iPhones. Apple reportedly began development of the modem in 2020, after acquiring the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business a year earlier to bolster its efforts. Barclays previously said the modem will support both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands of 5G."

Kudos to $AAL for allowing $OPTI employees to utilize the Rapid Test product recently during travel. Dr. Drew complimented the $AAL team as well. The patent also for the UV-C that either $AAPL or Samsung is in talks with through $OPTI will change the world for the better. Big shout out to which ever one of them had to courage to move forward with the UV-C patent technology in cell phones and tablets. Big money and safety for all.

Germany is green  we should be very green today
I demand that this stock hit 128 by friday. I won't accept nothing less than 128.
Apple hitting $150 by end of next week!!! Reddit chatter on Apple is huge!!! Apple is the next short squeeze!!!
"Both Samsung and Qualcomm are reporting chip shortages which will likely hold up Android mid-range smartphone production and sales. Samsung's Galaxy Note may not be sold this year, supposedly due to certain chip shortages which would include various Snapdragon processors. Apple seems to be in good shape due to buying up plenty of processor chip capacity from TSMC. It's unknown whether Apple will suffer chip capacity issues in the future if iPhone demand remains high. Fortunately, Apple had planned for high iPhone production well in advance. It's definitely to Apple's advantage to be able to buy up production thanks to having economies of scale larger than several rival companies combined. Apple seems safe for now as far as iPhone inventory is concerned. As Apple relies mostly on TSMC and has great ties with the company due to large orders, Apple should be in great shape for both the coming A14X Bionic and M1X products. Apple should have a good advantage this year as ARM-based processors come to the forefront of high-tech consumer products. It could take a couple of years for other companies to produce comparable laptop and desktop ARM-based products running Windows efficiently.It's being said that Apple appears to be mostly unaffected by chip shortages, so I hope what's being said is actually true."
Wow this stock has lost -$25/share since a month ago
Buy when others are selling.
Added today. GL longs. Hold it dont trade it. Great company.
Why does the media and analyst hate Apple?? They bash it anytime it goes up any.......
Invest all of your net worth in Apple today then don't see the stock price for 5 years. After 5 years you will have doubled your net worth. Your welcome!!
"Wake up.You're holding the biggest bubble western civilization has ever witnessed.No significant growth in revenues and earnings for two years. Yet, the stock price quadrupled."
this would send the market flying https://lussosnews.com/will-the-fed-use-ycc/
You want to own companies that continue to grow faster than expectations. Apple is one of these companies. Sometimes stocks get ahead of the earnings. But when they deliver earnings ahead of the estimates stock will continue to move up. Growth is where you want to be over time.
"get this.... the Dow has been in record highs .... I know aapl not Dow... and for 9 months this losing stock has gone down. so stop with after earnings, after press conference , it will go up..... no people are not supporting censorship or heavy influence on elections..... sell we told you for months now"
So Apple has a nice dividend and gains. Simple investment strategy buy more on any dip. Apple will come up and split again this year. $$$$$
Part of the move up is likely due to the wash sale rules expiring on the shares sold by the large funds over the last 6 weeks. Money is now free to move back into the stock without penalty and should start pushing prices higher again.
"I am tired of....o.. its a great proce to buyo..It is very cheap at this priceo..It will be 145,..160,.. 200 soon.o...This is great stock...just relaxEventhough I am long, just tired of the price and crawling of this one!"
"Most stocks have recovered and went higher since the Jan 27 market turmoil (due to GME); however, AAPL has actually gone lower since then (look at the chart). This is actually quite concerning as it is breaking below the upward price channel, and there is no obvious support point. Mr. Buffet selling is not helping either. The main thinking here is that AAPL is already the world's largest company at $2 Trillion, it is not as easy to double (to $4T) as smaller companies do as the economy reopens after pandemic."
"Just like in March through July I went heavy into purchasing stock. Up 350%. This week purchased so far 2000 shares of apple on top of 1700 I already had. Purchased 3000 RKT on top of1000 I already had and 1500 Wells Fargo on top of 900 already had and 1000 DraftKings on top of 1000 already had. I will continue buying. This is how you make wealth. Buy when everyone is selling. I’m still 200,000 on house money. Even after this week. So my point, weak people keep selling. Can’t thank you enough!"
No Press Release of any news from Apple since last earnings . Hopefully very soon. No penny was made since last earnings almost 2 months ago .
Sorry Yahoo! it's well above a 124$ stock.
IF today is a repeat of yesterday we will see $125+ today

"""we have tools to deal with that"". Yeah...like deliberately tanking the market."
Detsche Bank stays with the bulls. His 5-star analyst rates Apple shares a Buy along with a $160 price target. 
Half of Buffett portfolio is Apple...half!!...its amazing that Buffett only sold 6%...to hold half your portfolio with one stock is unheard of but Buffet said he considers Apple his third company and the greatest business in the world
"WE have been wrong all week,Proof that even use can not influence AAPL from being AAPL.There are three open ""trades in three"" trends above $125.Like how it traded in this $128 to $118 to $128 """"V"".It will print a third with those trends"
Until there is a corporate news release or a significant corporate event this is not crossing 122....
Don’t sell people it’s going to open $125 tomorrow

Gentlemen bottom line it appears that Apple is going nowhere since the split other than downward. Any thoughts? Mike
"imagine a market where sellers couldn't borrow and dump shares endlessly. Crypto! do DD and get away from this ""market"""
"Amit Daryanani further estimates that Apple should be able to grow services at a 19% compounded growth rate through the September 2024 fiscal year, at which point revenues from the segment would top $100 billion. He thinks that will include $29 billion from Apple Music and $6 million from Apple Pay.He also expects Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ to gain transaction over the next five years, with 80 million to 90 million subscribers each. At $100 billion, he adds, services would be 30% of Apple’s overall revenue and 45% of gross profit."
Sweet! Now down .51 ah. Haven’t had this much fun since my last colonoscopy.

Also hilarious how they pretend apple is a tech play rather than a nirvana growth/value hybrid
If Apple reach $100 I’ll sell my soul for Apple stocks and buy it back at $140
"thats IT,,,i am not buying anymore,,, this is insane why is it falling every second of the day. i own 2200 shares at 123 ,, can not afford anymore"
"Up after hours. Tomorrow is looking good. LOL. Again, where are all those who called $128 today and $130 by end of week. Whoosh. Gone. Vanished."
"Saying Apple is just a cell phone company is like saying Tesla is just an auto company. I own Apple but not TSLA as they are profitable, growing and innovative. Tesla is innovative but the valuation is hard to stomach. GL"

I don't know what's going on with apple but I bought high and lost 65000 in three days. Not happy about this have to stay in for the long haul and I mean long.
"what is going on is a little trick called short and distort...and the media is all in on 'we are moving out if growth'. There is no reason to downgrade growth stocks. Their financials are strong, and will continue. This is all a game."
The sellers who sold in the last 3 minutes on Friday will pay a much higher price to get back in on Monday. March 1 starts the climb up.
Why is Apple in talks with Kia and Hyundai? Why not partner with an American firm?
I loaded half of my portfolio with apple whenever the dip happened. I can see market is up but apple is down which is very rare scenario. Is it apple overvalued? I know its market cap almost doubled post pandemic but yet believed and invested.
Just bought an IPad today... Adding a drop in the bucket but Doing my part. 
"Buffett also says that Berkshire sold a small portion of its AAPL stake at the end of 2020, pocketing $11 billion. Because of Apple’s buybacks, however, which reduce the total number of outstanding shares, Berkshires ownership of AAPL has increased to 5.4% despite that sale:"
"Hey shorts, check the price this morning."
good company bad stock. not a buy.
"Why does APPL need need to getin to a new businesses which is ahighly competitive, and challenging enterprise and compete with the likes of Toyota, GM, Ford,Tesla and a hundred others when they can concentrate on audio/video, drivability controls and drivetrain management systems and have all the other manufacturers as customers and not competitors?Computers, communications, ITis APPL domain and they should stick to it instead of venturing of in to new frontiers with new partners."
there should be an age where child is not allowed to have a phone under 10 under 15 I don't know what you should do about it but the facts are the phones are crippling the children in a variety of different ways that we just ignore
If AAPL gets to $115 I’m tapping over to my margin account and buy a boat load of shares. What do you guys think?
"Longs you are good for this week definitely! I sold my $130 strike calls today, so it’s guaranteed that Apple will go above $130 tomorrow. The market has never missed a chance to lean me over a balcony rail and plow me like some school school"
"Technology shares are way undervalued otherwise I would not be fully invested in mostly the technology sector. Second if anyone can live without the use of technology please raise your hand. Even the good decent Amish people use technology. Third innovation and a dynamic sector that’s what technology is.

Imagine being on the moon and preparing your weekly grocery list calling the contacts on earth using your I-phone and getting your delivery within a couple of hours. Moon is only 288,000 miles away from earth and you could be at both places within a few hours all because of technology."
"what is apple doing to promote growth? any rumors, will they announce anything soon? i feel like lately this has basically been a dividend stock, but needs a higher dividend."
"Word is out that Apple may have cancelled the March 23rd Event. People have said they haven't gotten their invitations which they usually get a week before. Something must be up, they say, but Apple doesn't always do as expected. It's probably not that important anyway. Maybe Apple will just release the expected products without a bunch of fanfare now that the Apple Stores are open. Anyway, some YouTubers were surprised the talked about event wasn't going to take place. I doubt Apple needs to generate publicity one way or another. Customers and investors will be buying Apple products and stock at some point this year."
"I haven't posted in awhile, but I am still long and strong in Apple. Read late last week about potential diabetes monitoring in Apple Watch 7. If the rumor is true, they have just opened up a new potential group of sales to 400M people with diabetes worldwide"
Stop the political posts!

I have difficulty seeing a lot more money leaving tech to go into old line industries. banks and retail...
What performance?? Shares have not moved anywhere in the last 9 months...Cook getting free shares which is why he does not care about share prices or investors sentiments.....We need $2 div and 100B buyback to reach $150....too many shares outstanding
Look at the price of oil. Up almost 5% today. Huge tax on the economy.
"Yield pulling back , stimulus 1.9 trillion and apple stores starting to reopen nowhere else to go but up."
Maybe the Apple growth story is over and it’s simply a dividend stock. Always possible. No one knows.
she's back boys.

I guess the the fact that tech's did not get killed on Friday with the 10 year going over 1.60 was a positive.
At least we don’t have unhinged tweets on a daily basis which affect the stock price.
"The lesson learned here is that AAPL is definitely a long hold investment. Fluctuating up and down, but the end results annually is that AAPL will result in a healthy profit."
"Amazing!March 1 ($127+) to March 8 (pivot, $119) then yesterday ( $127) a $12 mini ""V"" that has happened here for years.AAPL will be AAPL.WE are VERY LONG."
AAPL WLL GO TO $ 100 TOLD 2 WEEKS AGO
Thanks  Apple for 4 free shares. Every share adds up.
the approaching bear market can be traced back today one or two in the keystone Pipeline was canceled it's my opinion
Apple management has been in a quite period which means somthing big is coming
"Apple stock has lagged behind the broader market in recent weeks. One analyst says it offers a good buying opportunity.The tech giant’s shares have slumped 16% since they hit a closing peak of $142.95 on Jan. 26. In comparison, the Nasdaq Composite has fallen less than 3%, and the S&P 500 is up 2% over the same period. Apple stock slipped 1.8% in recent Friday trading to $119.72.The company hasn’t actually said anything material in recent weeks, but there has been considerable speculation that there could be softening iPhone demand. The news service Nikkei Asia earlier this week reported that Apple recently cut its production plans for the first half of the year by 20%, due largely to weak demand for the iPhone 12 mini, the low-end version of the 5G-capable iPhone lineup announced last fall. Apple hasn’t commented on the Nikkei report, and didn’t respond to a Barron’s request for comment on it earlier this week.In a research note Friday, Morgan Stanley hardware analyst Katy Huberty repeated her Overweight rating and $164 target price on Apple stock, asserting that the recent selloff is a buying opportunity, and that recent chatter about developments in the Taiwan supply chain are more noise than substance.“Over the last two weeks, we’ve seen reports from [other analysts] that Apple is in the process of cutting iPhone production,” she writes. “These reports have contributed to Apple’s recent underperformance and investors are asking what we are hearing from the supply chain and how it impacts our view on iPhone shipments this year.”"
Well the stimulus passing the other night plus what buffet had to say about Apple plus the jj approval should give the market a good boost tomorrow. The ig Dow futures are 108.8
"apple will trade at 132 this week, and then drop to 130 for options."
"How can APPLE have good sales going forward when TAIWAN SEMI have NO CHIPS to supply to the American ?? you heard of shortage ??Apple coming earnings going to be #$%$ ... and the next earnings going to be worse ( NO CHIPS )wait for Apple tank to $108.00 .... at that time gamble a little in buying apple, just buy a little because the stock can still go much lower."
"So, traders are scared. As long as we have a President that keeps signing off on spending, and cutting jobs that could put more people to work then we have a problem with the Dollar. Tell me, what is backing the dollar?"
apple will opens up 5 this pre market wed am.
I dont get it! Why is everyone selling this? LIke seriously! The company makes so much more money than any other overvalued junk :/I would appreciate some more motivating comments please.
i bought in at 119.77. how much money am i gonna lose per share?
"Looking at the fundamentals I can't see anything bad or wrong in Apple, this is a solid stock, with huge upside potential for the years to come, and actually cheap. This is literally a dream for wise investors."
Down on a low volume day. For the record: AAPL got sold off over 10% after posting the greatest earnings report in the history of capitalism. And GME stock (company is in pre foreclosure) went UP 140% What does that tell you about the market? Of course a rhetorical question...Market hates Apple right now. This can last for a month or more. But when she breaks– it will be fast and furious.
I Love my Apple...
"Gamestop shares worth $178, apple worth $118. Whats wrong with this market and world?"

"I can certainly deal with giving up a $1.00 a share in my AAPL position, today. It's better than it was."
AAPL is due for a dividend increase. What are expectations? The % div rate is historically low. Will increase be substantial or a token few cents per share.

"I've seen this before. Everybody loves a stock, then almost instantly everybody hates it. Then all of a sudden everybody loves it again. It's all part of the game. That is why I don't panic"
"No t selling; AAPL is future stock and no matter it may go down with the market, it will bounce back quickly. It may not be impacted much. Even the market was down for the last few weeks, it did not go lower than 121."
I’ve been in AAPL for many years and have held and added. It is a gold mine that keeps giving.
"As an AAPL long, I’m buying at every turn right now. Blessing in disguise."
Do you think Foxconn factory in US will build Apple car?
"the reason Buffett clarified his position about apple in his shareholders letter this morning was that I emailed him 2 weeks ago that I was highly concerned about his recent selling of apple stock. I told him professionally that he was suppose to be a buy and hold investor, and never sell mantra philosophy. lastly I am happy that he addressed all my primary concerns that I referenced in his shareholders letter today."
Looks like Wall Street is anticipating J. Powell to lay and egg today. The Federal Reserve is out of bullets and everybody knows it but has been ignoring it. This is how bubbles get popped.

My Apple stock is currently at $approx. $1,113,500 ANDMy total profit to date on my Apple stock is currently $1,055,487! That’s 1,816.39%Needless to say I’ve see A LOT of big swings in the price of my stock and many many times I’ve had family and friends tell me I was crazy to hold onto it but now I’m the millionaire and they are still are chasing day trades to catch up. Morale of my story is buy and hold for the long term...you won’t regret it."
IF there is no am dip this can easily be $121+ today

"Last few Wednesdays after a run on Monday/Tuesday, AAPL has done this.Who here does not think we close higher from here on Friday?"
"Buy-Sell Buy-Sell Buy-Sell, Why? IF you look at Apple and made an investment in 2014 you would be up 545% now if you would of invested and walked away for 7-years. That is still a good return. But how many given themselves ulcers trying to work the market everyday. Pick good life changing, disruptive, innovative, companies leading the way in their industry, or new industry. The key is the long term trend of years of growth. Forget the monthly, yearly swings. What's the long term trend?"

buy Apple and hold it. For life.
The most important thing is for the techs to hold the gains today and a minor follow through tomorrow.
But why is Apple buying back shares seemingly regardless of their price? It appears clear that Apple expects its share price to grow much higher in the future.
One of those days ...All good things to those who wait ...
"Laid a small egg into the close, but still a pretty good day. I think we see a challenge of the 50 DMA just under $130.00 some day this week. Will it break it, or dance around it like it has most of the last year? I don't know but I think we get there."
"Apple's valuation is certainly not cheap, but it is reasonable given Apple's potentials in digital content, 5G, and healthcare."

Watch how it ends positively
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx

Dow Jones index closed above 33K for the first time ever without Apple's help.
It’s gonna make a move up the 2nd week of April ahead of earnings imo. I can’t begin to guess how much higher but it should move some

Nice little turn around today. Capitulation in the making?
"Google is up 21 percent this year. Tesla is down 15%, Amazon down 8 percent, apple down 8 percent, nvidia down 4 percent."
"Great Buy right now. Nothing stopping Apple, maybe some dips, but just look at the chart.. Apple is a success story and always will be. Apple EV coming soon to tackle the car market that by itself is going to be huge in a few years. In the meantime, new Apple tech, computers, pads, iPhones. All will be good. It is the standard of technology."
Look at those futures! Are they for real?
Power hour folks!

Also starting next week we will have between $350 billions to $650 billions coming into the market via the stimulus package"
It’s quadruple day today. I think most likely another dip today
Buy now or buy first thing Monday morning because honest to God I believe a massive inflow of money is coming into the market come Monday. It could be anywhere from $350 billions to $650 billions and the market will rocket to the sky. Some of it will go into bonds and money market but just a trickle. Almost over 90% will go into the stock market for long term investments and growth
"118's again.. lord I'm down 30 grand in 3 days , I'm seriously starting to panic.. twtr, aapl and mrna.."
Hmm. So I checked and some institutions have started to buy back today. I also saw some buying yesterday but it wasn’t a mix of institutions buying and selling. Hopefully this should go up later next week :)
Here's to a good day tomorrow

"Let’s talk about Warren Buffett. Had you invested $1,000 with Warren Buffett in 1959 you would be worth millions upon millions of dollars in term of today because his average return since 1959 has been 23.3% yearly. So any young person say 18 to 28 years old or even older who plans to live to be 85. That gives you 60 years worth of returns. If that is not tremendous then what is? I know some of you are chronic complainers. Even if you had a sunny 365 days with 72 degrees temperatures you will still be complaining but for the rest what I just said is worth considering."
If you want to make a easy $15 a stock strong buy and hold it will get to $130 this week
Here we go green !
"From my experience - this is similar to what we saw back in September / October 2020. Maybe just give it time. When this starts to rally, there will be no stopping."
I thinkit lot of money from stimulus will be invested in the market for long terrm benefits for folks who do so. I read some of that estimate is about 50% go into the market folks. Thanko
We continue to collect $135 May calls. Follow the advise of Morgan Stanly people. Target is $190 for this year. Apple will make loads of cash on Digital Wallet for Cryptos. Forget the car...the money is in DEFI and Crypto financials.

"Tomorrow $119. Congrats to all shorties, your patience is rewarded. And must be pleasure making money shorting the best company in the world."
So the thousands of us that told our friends and family to buy Apple stock when it split was too easy ! From Warren Buffet on down are gonna make sure you were wrong ..... For now ..they are Manipulating this stock and I am NOT selling one share !!
A Citigroup analyst says Apple could be on the fast track to a market cap of $3 trillion if the Apple Car begins rolling out ( seeking alpha)
New AAPL iPads in April possible... https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/apple-reportedly-preparing-high-end-ipads-could-launch-by-april.html
"To all new Apple traders. This is not new, pullbacks like this has happened many times to Apple. Those that are considering getting in will be very fortunate at this entry point. Don't be crying on the sidelines when it pops and keeps going. Just look at the parameters and balance sheet and its an easy call."
I learned to stick with buying and not trading . These April calls I experimented with will probably end up worthless if this trend continues but the buyers of Apple will reap great rewards over the years.
Wallstreet wants the market down. They are offloading their shares to the retailers and shorting the market. did you see what happened on Monday march 8th. it is a sociological game to give the retailers the feel that the market is rebounding then they puul the rug from under the retailers and leave them holding the bag.
Here is statement from Warren Buffet: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/warren-buffett-says-apple-is-probably-the-best-business-i-know-in-the-world.html
"Walter Isaacson, famed author of “The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race,” discussed how technology needs to help humanity, adding that Apple (AAPL) is on the right track, while Facebook (FB) and other social media networks are allowing for the spread of disinformation and anger.“I think we always have to worry about whether tech is a force for good,” Isaacson said. “I think Apple actually is, in general, because it's both protecting our privacy, and it's not basing its entire business model on the advertising model, which means harvesting...all of your information and microtargeting things to you.”This will translate to customer loyalty from millennial generations, and thus AAPL shareprice growth."
"i personally belive that this is the bottom for apple... ill be shocked if this drops lower honestly, 115 -116 is our support so i think we are good"
"All fund managers sold Nasdaq and all technology stocks at the last 10 minutes today because they want to lock profits for their companies and get a huge bonus for themselves by the end of February. They will buy back on Monday, March 1, then everything will go up to the same level or higher than before 10 minutes at close today."
"Tech needs a green day. Maybe, today."
Tell me what do you think people will do with stimulus checks which are going to folks mostly already employed?
Apple is now 51.2% of my portfolio! I cannot justify buying more dips to myself! Please go up Apple 
"Apple is simply the Nike of the tech world (that’s a compliment). There are always new upstarts, but all the cool kids know and will pay for the top brand. Simple as that.Back in the mid 90’s I kept hearing Nike was peaking....yeah, that’s what they say about Apple now. Look where Nike is 25 years later."
Stimulus bill passed. $5600 for a family of 4. Everyone getting new iphones or Macs.
"apple is up 1.15, to 125.14, follow through rally."
Get in. Market will roar back to new highs. Block out the fear mongering and make money.
I told ya so
There are a bunch of scared people that were chasing IPO's with sky high PE's or a negative PE. When people get scared they run towards the greatest company in the world. I have been long since 2013 and hold every single share!
"Lets hope options manipulators don't take this below $120. Quadruple witching this Friday, so expect volatility."
Gotta touch that 200 day at $113 before heading higher!
"""ICU B Taking UR Money""? more like ""ICU B Making Poor Decisions"" am i right? up top!"
This stock compared to Gamestop - which does not make a penny and is up only 4000 percent. Should we be investing in GME since Apple can't seem to take off.
"My core holding are Apple, SNAP, and VIAC among others. My newest stocks are Draft Kings and Palantir for the future. I try and invest in stocks that will be #1 dominate player in their sector. Bottomline, this strategy has made me a lot of money. The key is to buy and hold and never buy at 52 week highs."
I like the stock.
Oil stocks on fire boys. Hold APPL during this slump as it will pay off.
I thought this stock would climb rapidly post-split. It's been sideways for a while after crushing earnings in Dec. Gotta make a move upward soon. Consolidating?
"can't nobody tell me the wind blew him down, 3 times! oh helz nah, I live in the windiest city in the country and I ain't never been knocked to the ground because of it."
"27 million shares after hours, why?"
"Short AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, NFLX, FBTheir time has passed."
apple stock is a long term investment hold it for 5 to 10 years from now.
"""The Law of Diminishing Returns""...Once again, I realize there are no Dems here educated or intelligent enough to understand and why I use it in conjunction with Powell's numerous attempts to assuage people."
"Meh, apple core business hasn’t changed just because of a 1.74% 10y bond.It’s still very very very cheap to borrow money and besides apple doesn’t really have to !its just cheaper to do so .Like buying new car.At 2 % interest my cash returns is much better somewhere else then flat out buying the car cash.Apple money machine is still churning 175 eoy."
"I hold Apple and Microsoft stock from 2011, and I am in profit more that 475k. Today I will sell half of my Apple shares and move the money somewhere else, probably Tesla. Apple gave its best and I think thats it. Yes, it is the richest company in the world, but if after 110b ravenue stock price is tanking something is not right. After stock split 6 months ago price is almost the same. Even Warren Buffett sold twice in the last 12 months. Maybe apple car can affect something, but they need to be fast, because competitors are strong."
"SAME pattern again, big slingshot up over 7 tomorrow"
185 million shares a blowout day of selling
"AAPL is 64% of my holdings at the height my returns were 33% on AAPL, they fell now to 6%. I am putting my $ where my mouth is, I am staying long. For the next 3 weeks in March I truly expect the returns to hover around 13% and end of April 18%. Not greedy just having confidence that AAPL will turnaround to my expectations in the long run. Positive long."
Nothing can explain apples lack of participation today...
Wow ok. Gives a dollar. Takes back two :/
Let us not forget that AAPL's target price was raised by something like 19 analysts since the beginning of the year...No downgrades and no target price reductions...
Look how far apart the 200 sma and 50 sma lines are spread apart on the nasdaq. They will snap back closer together sooner or later and usually ends up hitting the 200 sma line again. We are in a giant bubble right now
This is pure manipulation. Down 12.29 percent past month when the company has solid performance. The yields with the bonds happened after the fact and has nothing to do with this artificial stock price. Bankers aren’t happy unless they are killing your companies.
"Strong earnings, great products and a huge amount of cash in the bank. But yeah Apple is dead! See you at 150!"
Come on Apple!! Give us a 127!!
you literally can't lose money with apple unless you sell the stock. I had an uncle 5 years ago flip out when it went under 100. it then went up to 500 and split. so check your apple shares in 5 years and if you lost money. you were right
"During the last 4 years, AAPL grew from $27 to $110.In the next 4 years, will AAPL grow comparably to $525.Highly unlikely… LOL!"
"The odds of a tech giant to miraculously fail is insanely low. If you bought the top, just keep averaging down. The tendie gods will come but you have to filter out all the “news” and other BS."
"THINK, I made money big time today by selling Aapl and bought ABNB before the ER when it was down at $183 and today I sold at $209!!!! Cashed out $10,400 in one day!"
Step 1: Cash stimulus checkStep 2: Buy new iPhone This baby is going up on Monday...glad I bought the dip!
yahoo censorship of my opinions. that's why aapl is losing censorship. one day you will realize it and change.
We should see a nice move higher on Monday and Tuesday.
all the tech-stocks green! And this one like an old man! Can't climb enough! 
Hopefully the market sentiment will change next week and also some positive news from Apple to follow!
"$5600 for a family of 4 with a AGI of under $110k. They won’t be buying AAPL stock, they’ll be buying iPhone and iMacs"
"Turn your chart screen upside down, it might make you feel better."
Need to break 127. That is 50 MA. Go AAPL.
"Apple could multiply their dividend 8 fold, and it still wouldn’t make a dent in their cash position"
"Apple buybacks by itself should increase eps 5% a year for the next 4 years until Apple is cash neutral. Can only imagine FCF in 2026 from iPhone, VR Watch, services etc products and Apple Car"
Apple can keep this bull market roaring and the Dow going to stellar
Two dollars a day until it reaches 140. I have been right every time and I DEMAND and end to this charade. Shorts MARGIN CALLS
Unreal the powers to be that can keep apple under 120 a share now this is Big Time manipulation
Apple’s enormous cash position leaves me sleeping easy at night as I accumulate more shares with each dip.
"""stocks are the one thing people fear buying when they're on sale"""
"$OPTI announced that now ""several interested parties"" have come to get exclusive rights to the patent for UV-C in cell phones and tablets. I guessing Samsung beats $AAPl to the punch. It'd be even funnier if $NOK beat them both!"
Monthly Option Expiration today is an entire different battlefield. Rather than just the foot soldiers battling; there will be the air corps and artillery engaging.Good Luck
Looks like everyone is running for the hills in the wake of higher rates...Be prepared for steep losses and hyper inflation as your free weekly checks run out
Goody Morning Ladies and Gentlemen too. I sayeth we go up big time next week. Stay on course and stay invested. Same thing happened last year around this time but then we moved higher and higher. Thanko
"Regardless of Apple’s price closing today, at tomorrow’s closing AAPL will be back at $124+"
"If Apple had never split its stock, shares would have been trading at $27,957.44 as of Friday's close."
I bough AAPL at $125 back in August last year.... and now still hovering around that mark... Waste of time
"And we’re down with all these upgrades , institutions playing games looking for the short term vs long term ..I guess we are now viewed as the boring investment as opposed to the get rich quick crew searching for utopia. Stop watching GME and invest don’t gamble, leave that to Vegas and AC .."
Buy all u can at these levels and retire :))
I sold appl today and went for the supermodel tsla.
"I only have 18 shares of Apple, solely because I use an iPhone and a Mac and I like them. Never going to make or lose much money with my 18 shares, so I'd completely chill but have absolute faith in the company."
"Let me guess... everybody will sell at open then buy back after Powell speech at higher price, that's smart lol"
recession coming due to stock losses
I was a new shareholder after split. I started my position at $106.00. I WILL TAKE MORE LOL
"there all going down in my opinion ;. amazon, aapl, twitter, saabook...... censorship is anti human evolution .... common sense 101......"
the stock is not going to go up until you get some leadership action on center stage. there must be guidance there has to be a vision delivered to the masses
Everything has hit all time highs. It’s sell the news. We still haven’t see the sell of capitulation. $105 to $110 will be a good entry
Maybe someone knows the FED is going to tamp down rates! Info today I believe.
Extremely cheap at this price
All we can do is hold :/
"Stock market is a rotation. Money in one sector, sell , invest money in another sector...rinse and repeat. Patience will serve you well."

Apple is a follower .. not a innovatorwhile samsung have big screen phone making tons of money.. apple finally do big screen phone.while Tesla are in one of the hottest sector.. electric vehicle .... apple finally start doing electric vehicle.while everyone is buying Bitcoin ... watch apple the follower buys Bitcoin and following what Tesla is doingApple is a follower ... the company have no vision whatsoever
"tech is done, if we don't get a March even announcement on the 7th, I'm going off grid."
Reached the upper limit of trading range. Careful adding more at this level. $112 print still a possibility. I'm long but hedged and don't recommend short.
gamestop 180+ flying high and apple 118 struggling
"total MM manipulation. They scared and shook a bunch off in the OTC, and now tech.. they are going after your shares on the cheap, and taking out as many stop losses as they can (they know where people lay down stops.... ) GLTU... I am holding, simple"
"For those who sold last week at a loss, they basically have no idea about investment strategy. They don’t know what the business they were holding and they don’t know the values business generates over time m. All they can do is staring at the most useless thing called stock price and speculate the future. Most of time, they are making wrong bets. Stock price is the result, not cause. Fundamentals are the real cause that serious investors should focus on."
"Simply a game of chess between retail and Wall Street.$125 needs to be ""the line in the sand"" now.Otherwise people will get hurt"
"You are dreaming if you think this action is from investors with long time horizons,"
Even during pandemic $aapl posted massive earnings. Now in 2021 economy is going to be back then assume how huge $aapl earnings will be. Stay long!!!!!!!!!!!!
"the problem is the apple longs over the years were true longs with 10yr time frames minimum that just checked yesterdays closing SP in the paper in the morning before they went to work, we watch the minute candles all day and get riled by AH movement. we've created more opportunity for ourselves but the price is increased anxiety."
Da Vinci? Any thought on today? Everything seems like it’s going down again :/
I can't wait until the feds raise taxes. Many of you deserve it.

"This is not the stock to trade !!It’s for long termWait for 2 years, you will be rewarded with $100-150 further upside from current price !!"
I have no idea why it gets so political on this chat. I am just glad AAPL was green today and I hope it will get back to ATH soon.
"Listen to me folks, GREEN and MEAN Go Apple"
Will be green after the FED hearing and close in the high 120ies this week. People are lining up to buy Apple products and the stock alike! Just hold!
Patience will definitely be rewarded!!!
The fear mongering headline of “Apple cuts product X production” has been played time and time again over the years. It’s what happens when you consistently create newer versions of products.Know what’s happened (in due time) after those headlines hit? Stock goes higher....cuz the institutions got your shares.
"How fast things change, last week it was doom and gloom and CNBC was negative about tech, this week completely a turn! People were saying there is 16B shares out there and that is why the stock is not moving, well 200 millions shares moved it up $8! If you don't think this market is manipulated and controlled by big boys and MM's you are crazy. they dictate everything,"
Looking very promising today longs!
"Once Covid is history, people will put discretionary spending much more on stuff that they couldn't enjoy during Covid... things like travel and leisure. Apple's product sales will go down. Long $DIS, $ABNB, $BNKG, short $AAPL"

WE can and will depart in a heart beat and run silent"
"Again, I'm glad that I purchased 500 shares @$118... Now AAPL is over my cost basis. Holding my little 3000 shares until the next split. Go longs!"

Who cares about Cathie Woods Ark invest. Funny the newly appointed darling of CNBC is crashing and burning. She's become a desperate day trader. Why are her trades influencing the market? It's a joke!
"How is Ford and gm a buy when they are now up over 100% since last years March lows, but Apple is considered over valued when it is actually making money?"

"AAPl is just being AAPL. Historical Prices will clearly show how it trades in ""V"" patterns.Algorithim players just being traders. A coin has two sides. They play the upside and the downside.Last week on Thursday when AAPL dipped to $120.99, we saw AAPL rally to almost $125- on Friday.On Monday, WE saw AAPL almost hit $128.70; AAPL had hit $130 twice as an intra day high. AAPL trades in ""V"" patterns. IT will pivot and rally again. IT is its' nature.Isn't $126+ the ten day moving average?"
Nice rally from $118 last week. It was expected to gain with $1.9T stimulus but I'm still seeing this range bound. Tech rotation still happening.
"Loading up Full Strength, Too Cheap Too much Upside Ahead."
The stock has been trailing the Nasdaq market and other tech and Faang stocks after a fantastic quarter. Waiting for a break out that has not materialized. Any thoughts about why?
"Let's be honest - Apple is increasingly a mature business whose earnings and revenues have been almost flat for three years. It is not some stellar growth stock anymore and should not have a P/E above 30. Even when the company was growing, its P/E was in mid-teens to low 20s."
Buffett is buying in anyday today tomorrow strong buy and hold
"Between 9/19/2012 to 8/19/2014, 480 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down at one point (44.4%) during this period. Steve Jobs had just died in October 2011 and Tim Cook had taken over the jobs a few months prior. Apple would not recover until Apple announced the 7 for 1 stock split in June 2014. People who purchased the stock in late 2013 through the mid point of 2014 are up 500-550% today if they held all shares.Conclusion: Apple ran after the stock split and those who were patient were rewarded. Apple's stock gain during 2014 was 37.72%Between 2/23/2015 to 2/13/2017, 498 days, Apple was down from its all time high with the stock down (32.1%) at one point in this period. Conclusion: Apple started to run in the beginning parts of 2017 and rewarded stock holders with a huge 46.11% return by the end of 2017.Between 10/3/2018 to 10/11/2019, 257 days, Apple was down from its all time high and at one point during late December 2018 was down (38.7%).Conclusion: Those who hung on saw an epic 86.16% return in 2019.Between 2/10/2020 to about 3/16/2020, 36 days, Apple was down 31% from its all time high. The world was in panic over COVID. Then the first first stimulus came 3/23/20 and Apple recovered.Conclusion: Those who were patient were rewarded with an outstanding 82% return of Apple is 2020."
"Fox News is predicting a vote on the stimulus package later today on Saturday March 6, 2021"
"I believe $AAPL is worth $250 + Folks, it’s all free cash flow derived from operating income. It’s not asset sales, it’s not unrealized marked-to-market gains on the balance sheet, it’s not bolt-on acquisitions; it’s a high margin, free-cash-flow-generating machine with exceptional governance.The cash flow statement tells you everything you need to know. Shout out to the folks that appreciate the perfection of the business vs. the appreciation of the share price."
Here comes the green. Go longs!!!
We have lift off. All system go. GO FLY Apple . 
"apple is in a severe losing streak for 7 months. I would sell today, and buy Viacom in small amounts."
"Dan Ives: “iPhone 12 strength not slowing down; more good news on the horizon. Apple’s stock has taken a breather since its jaw dropping performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, we view this as a short term blip in the stock’s upward trajectory as our Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength we are seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, we believe Apple will hit $3 trillion in market cap by year-end.”Maintains Outperform rating and Street-high $175 price target."
"5k shares and holding, if drops more u know what i do? I buy more, simple as that, not selling any of my precious shares."
Due for an increase of dividend at next declaration. Used to be 1%+ rate. What are expectations? A token increase or a substantial increase to the old rate prior to the price increase?
Buffett going to take this to $140  ARK buying in today as well
Think I've found a new hobby. I'll be buying and holding apple for the rest of my life.
bad week for Apple. I am long AAPL. See you in a few months when we will be back over $150!
Steve Jobs just sold half his shares. Not good!
"Recap of Da Vinci since Dec 31 or from the time the stock was purchased this yearJan 22 calls had a 15% premium of market price. For example on Dec 31 AAPL was $131 the Jan 22 $130 calls were $19 - $20. Today they are $10. Stock dipped almost the same amount of the profit from the sale of this covered call. $131 - $11 = $120....Stock is now $120 in pre-market.When AAPL was $135 the premium was $135 X 15% = $20_ etcWhen we were first exploring the Da Vinci Strategy we posted to ""walk dow"" the action but later learned to do nothing or close out the trade once the sale of the call fell 50%AAPL220121C00130000... 2021-03-08 3:59PM EST... 130.00... 9.90AAPL220121C00135000... 2021-03-08 3:59PM EST... 135.00... 8.53 AAPL220121C00140000... 2021-03-08 3:59PM EST... 140.00... 7.25 AAPL220121C00145000... 2021-03-08 3:53PM EST... 145.00... 6.20Now when all sellers of these covered calls close out that trade at the same time, it lifts a weight off of the upside action. Stock rallies"
"I’m pretty new to investing. I usually put $150 a week in. Should I buy a few shares of this, or buy something like $AAPL since their stock is pretty cheap right now + they will have some events coming up in March/June"
Was able to initiate a position at 117 today wow....will accumulate if price continues to dip but a great price point to start out at
The short sellers had better be covering. Apple is back.........
Big money and smart investors seeing APPL as way over sold are starting to pile back in! We will see $130 in the next few days and $140 next week!

Apple will report its next earnings on May 3rd. The stock will be at least $150 before the report. I’m totally comfortable waiting 2 months for that.
One I really appreciate Apple doing is valuing my privacy in this day and age!!! Facebook is doing just the opposite. That is the only reason I need to hold my shares..... Tried an android phone for a couple weeks and realized why Iphones are the best!!! Enough said...
One thing is certain. The pendulum will swing back in aapl's favor. Just hold. It's as simple as that.
"126.50 reached, the good news keeps coming. Now to order my new Les Paul. Thanks shorts. Keeping a base of 11,000 shares and playing with 500 shares which I bought for 118 and change a week ago. Now I want to buy my niece a new TV. She is a good mom with a great husband and child but like most newly married folks they don't have a lot of disposable income. So I am looking to buy back in on the next dip. Thanks again shorties."
Mon morning the market and AAPL are going green in a big way. Time to climb again. The correction is over.
Only 10% make money day trading. You can’t time it or if u go u will make few thousand but long term holders will make much more long run. In. I time back to highs. Stay long!
Sweet emotions the wifey said I can buy a Rickenbacker 12 string if I win the money on Apple. I sent my niece 500 dollars toward a new tv. So thanks shorts

"“The weakness came as the 10-year Treasury yield extended its gains.

Considering all Apple does is recycle old ideas there really is no reason for them to trade at a P/E of greater than 25 maximum.
"Apple's recent pullback as a buying opportunity, says Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said she views recent iPhone supply chain data points as ""noise rather than an indicator of demand"" and she sees the recent pullback in Apple shares as a buying opportunity. Following a recent report from the Nikkei that claimed ""the US tech giant is cutting orders for all iPhones around 20% compared to its plans in December,"" Morgan Stanley's Greater China Technology Hardware research team published a note that said their checks indicate build orders for iPhone 12 models excluding the mini and legacy iPhone 11 models are being revised up, not down, Huberty tells investors. In addition, Apple's Taiwanese suppliers are posting accelerating year-over-year growth and iPhone shipments in China remain strong, said Huberty, who keeps an Overweight rating and $164 price target on Apple shares."

"Amit Daryanani note to clients: “App Store revenue grew 30% in February, another strong month in what has been a great 6 months for the App Store. We estimate total App Store developer revenue grew to $4.4bn in February; up 30% Y/Y (vs. +40% in January, +31% in December). The growth in App Store revenue remains relatively broad based, with all categories reporting impressive growth with the exception of Music (+10%).The App Store is only one piece of the services business, but with QTD growth at 35%, we see an increasing likelihood of upside to consensus estimates. The Entertainment segment (41%) remains the best performing segment, likely driven by tailwinds related to numerous streaming service launches. China remains the slowest growing of the major Geo’s with revenue +24%; however, it is still well above the single digit growth rate reported for much of 2020. The solid growth in China also comes despite a difficult comp (lapping COVID tailwinds) and the 24% rate is an improvement vs. the 20% in January.Net/Net: We think growth 20%+ is looking increasingly likely.Maintains Outperform rating and $163 price target."
Tesla and Apple are going to open very green Monday strong buy and hold you will make money!
"So on March 1, 2021 - Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan Trust Fund bought 5,578,624 shares of apple priced at a market value of $740.23M. Cheers!"
2% bond yield does not affect AAPL when it can produce revenue of 111 Billion in a quarter during a pandemic! This is to shake out the week minded and gives the believers a chance to buy again!
FB has again reached to where it was three months before..at peak. Tim and Team are still dragging themselves at low!
Down almost everyday lately WHY?
BAD NEWS.. DEEP RED SEAS FOR TODAY 'S MARKETS....The rise in bond yields is again hurting ‘long-duration’ technology stocks .....
"I noted $110.00 as the bottom about three weeks back, the fact is that's possible; but for the most part, this is a buying opportunity...add if you can afford it and hold because AAPL is not going anywhere."

There are only 2 things people will mostly likely spend their Stimulus checks: 1. AAPL Shares. 2. iPhones. Both are Win-Win for Apple.
Will be worse tomorrow when the Dow pauses. Apple longs are in a rough spot. Not making gains today...is....not....good.
Yep. That’s the REAL concern. If the Dow and Nasdaq decide to give back some of these big gains. $120 now. $105 if the markets decide to take everything down. Double whammy.
"AAPL might be in trouble by using slave labor in China, OMER does not, and will perform better:[1] Narso approval July 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties. [2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by June, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end. [3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself. Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued, here."
"Starting this month, I'll buy 25 AAPL shares each month forever. In 10 years I expect to have 3000+ Apples (checked divy reinvest option). I don't care what price it is trading at in 2030 AD. This is money I can afford to lose each month and I am thankful to Apple the company for creating great revolutionary products. Consider this as my donation just like I do to Salvation Army and local Temple. With a single iPhone, they created a path for greater productivity and comfort (Android copycat followed) that was in miserable state by - Voice recorder makers, camcorder makers, camera makers, flash light makers, heart rate gizmos, DVD players, CD players, TVs, AT&T phone bill surprises, texting charge surprises ....."
Every day is a good day to buy apple
"Apple stopped being an innovative growth company. Electric cars are impractical. uneconomic, bad for the environment and a follow the leader fad."
$$$ are pouring into tech stocks again!
This is about the time that people go from fear to massive opportunism at the carnage of buying opps. We lived thru much higher rates and tech was fine $sq $pypl $dm $amZn $aapl
"Motorola, is poised to eat Apples lunch. No one's going to plunk down their stimulus check, when gas hits $3.25. and back rents are due. The slide continues. Institutional investors are leaving."
Lol AAPL is roughly 10 points away from. It’s resistance of $140 with an ATH above that and people claim this is going down the tubes just because of a little haircut. This consolidation will seem like a gift in the future. Apple is going to continue to do what it does which is make great products for its customers and all the Apple fans will continue to support it. Invest and hold long term not only because of capital gains taxes but also to reap the fruits of an excellent American Enterprise.
Bought more at 122.95 ...expect 125 breakout will come. AAPL is heading 130 today
Come on Apple!! Give us a 125 today!!
"Let’s all calm down , this is apple, just hold don’t play the short game and lock up your shares from shorting by placing an open buy order at 150 price limit"
$119.99! What a surprise.
Shorts trying to scare people their PUTS expire today markets going up in Germany so nice try we going to $125 today

"“Investors” are always looking for the quickest buck, and then they kick themselves when they look back in 5 years at how obvious it woulda, coulda, shoulda been being long in Apple the whole time!"
buy any stock. it's all going up. Fed will keep saying no inflation because if they raise rates it all collapses.
this is a buying opportunity
Apple oversold. Let a new rally begin.
"so Apple FCF is 73b , growth of net income over last 4 years is 5.8%. 10 year yield is 1.40% and market return over last 10 years is 14% based on 3 exchange averages. Apple equity beta is 1.27.. Cost of equity = yield + beta(market return-yield(risk free)). This figure is 17.4%. Apple growth multiplied by their FCF is 77.23b. 77.23/(17.4%-5.8%) = 665.77b total value. Apple long term debt is 92b so 666-92b=574b value/16.79b shares = $34 per share value"
"Covid cases are decreasing, daily vaccinations are increasing, people are ready to spend money which is good indication that 2021 is going to be big comeback for economy. Stay long $aapl."
It was nice to get some last Thursday at $121. I love when that happens
People trying to time the market lose over 92 percent of the time. Long term play on Apple. Trying to time a low point is not the best idea.
I’ve been reading Apple news websites. Looks like April before their next product/s.
AAPL has decided in rise dividends!!!! buy buy.AAPL 225 is coming
New unique products from AAPL will take the stock to new heights in the next month or so.....I will keep buying on the dip.
Dow closed at session lows. Tomorrow will be another downer.This has a long way to go.
Green like kale.
99 gap will be filled
"someone bought 72,000 strike 127s 30 seconds after the bell..... lets go!"
"Wide open border now, 100k on their way."
Lesson learn never to buy stock touch by Warren Buffet first it was IBM and now AAPL.
i got 318 shares. adding weekly!!!
"TAIWAN GDP 2021 has been updated vs consensus. Booyaaa. AAPL will benefit huge above 200 level. Hedgies will get burned, very soon. We have been buying at pullbacks every dollar. We are buying at the opening tomorrow. Also we will set buy stop orders order every 20 cents in the way up, Also, if pullback , we are buying every 50 cents pullback. In the end AAPL will break 145, then 150 then 200 in Q1. Hedgies games will end . Trust in EPS/revenues in Q3, Q4. That's truth. TRUTH will prevail ad lead. Tic Toc. Bulls continues"
Call me the eternal optimist or what ever. But I am thinking AAPL will be gaining in the PM and may actually close green. Save your negative remarks till after the bell.
Stores in US reopening! Those who bought the dip last week and those who held are gonna be rewarded
AAPL WILL TAKE YEARS BEFORE GO TO $.140 AGAIN
Does anyone know when apple announces their earnings-announcement date?
I should have bought more.
AAPl slingshot will be severe from oversold. Up and closes over 129.3
The pain when you see share price of GME exceed AAPL’s share price

"trq up 30% year to date, pe 7.8, copper prices up big as electric cars use 5x as much as gas ones"
"technical chart shows lower highs and lower lows...it's textbook downtrend pattern, we need to break 122.5 to stand firm above the downtrend line, then we can retest 127 again, really really hope we move up from here, but if not, then we are facing lower low again, can be 115 or even 112...tmr is critical"
Amazing how they Upgrade this Stock yesterday and it's down 2% today. Is it a Shorting Technique?
"I’ve done really well with Apple, in fact I bought my home 5 years ago in cash from apple proceeds. In late December I sold at 136 and rolled it into oils. My plan now is to buy ½ back at 100 and if it drops to 90 i’ll buy back ¼ then ¼ at 85. The reason being is that this drop in the NAZ is sector rotation and nothing to do about apple’s potential."
apple will not go lower than 117.56. the 20 % correction is over. massive buying opportunity up to 132.23 only.
"I'm not one to try to force predictions from patterns, but this is a textbook cup and handle, even with low volume on the handle side. Soon the March event will be scheduled and the forces will combine to what I think is a steady melt upwards toward the high 130s, and probably a 140s rally the week of the event."
what do you guys think of a Porsche GT3 manual? I'm compelled but there are quite a few options in the 200k cad range.
"Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level."
Pull up the charts of tons of old big tech clearly massive pe contraction is starting and there are not enuff real buyers after a year of fake green futures nighthly by the fed there is alot less support underneath than any of u understand $qqq $aapl $msft / fed likely wants market goong down so bond slide stops too: )

"Alert to my 39 mil customers. We will drive AAPl stock up tomorrow , bucking any downtrend in the Nasdaq or Dow Jones. Let's do it"
Buying 666 shares when maker open Long termApple is KING
holding a 1000 share at 138.00 (please refrain from laughing) so almost 20 k...... here where I'm concerned.. please just trying to see if this whole tech will continue to plummetWith approved economy the yield goes up an inflation rises= stock goes down ? ? ?
Worried that AAPL might slide 30% from here ?Trying to catch a 0.65 % dividend yield?Try CLPS DLPNSFOR VSBGF.All of those could triple easily with in days or weeks
"That movement at the end was not 'manipulation' (your code word for whatever you don't understand in the markets), it was overwhelming sell demand. Just look at the volume, that wasn't an artificial depression of the price. There was a LOT of Apple stock getting sold at the end of the day."
Power hour folks! Let's do 130 by eod!
"Those concerned about the high level of the DOW may want to consider buying some insurance (ie. UltraPro Short Dow30) ticker SDOW. Since, it is a 3X leveraged short, it is NOT a buy & hold instrument, but can be used for pull backs and protect your long term investments. Just wait for the volume to dry up a bit, it's pretty high today. BTW - Good way to TEMPORARILY short the DOW 30 in a cash account (ie. IRA)."
I have wanted to get in here for the longest time and I decided to recoup my initial investments in my portfolio and for once I timed it okay. My first purchase was Apple and I was embarrassed to not have owned it. I’m smiling now
yo sisters and bros only very few short and day traders come to work today. no holiday I know of? yes siri bob lot of them turned into long term buyers and holders I sayeth with utmost faith. Even Uncle Warren is buyin more of Apple folks. And I say with utmost confidence he is a very smartee investors. There aint nobody like him in the investing business and he is buyin more. Thanko and goody morning to you my sisters and brothers.
"“ Robert Paul Leitao: In my brief reading, it looks like inflation fears spooked the market into the close. I’ll go back to a point I made earlier: As rates on virtually risk free instruments begin to rise, the opportunity costs of investing in equities also rise. There’s nothing “wrong” with Apple. It’s just no longer a momentum play (for now), there are no near-term catalysts for the stock (that are known at this time) ahead of March quarter results and it’s not an income stock. Great company, great long-term appreciation play, but not a COVID recovery play. Apple at times is an ATM for the market. With a market cap of over $2 trillion, it’s among the most liquid and easily tradable equities on Wall Street. Need cash for the glamour/momentum stock of the day? Sell Apple. But buy it back maybe later.”"
"Apple is expected to launch AirTags, new iPads, and possibly updated AirPods at a spring event, and leaker ""Kang"" believes that date will be March 23."

the stock went straight down in 3 minutes from 124 to 121 at close. had to be manipulation with someone wanting shares. thoughts?
when did this appl page get so political?
"Given its a Friday...I do not expect buying into the close. With options expiring and the general softness and interest rate anxiety hard to see a strong close today, but in the big picture APPL seems fairly valued here. It may take time for this market to sort itself out. So many issues flowing in different directions. Markets do not like uncertainty."
"What is happening now is a result of over inflated expectations of returns due to stimulus. Under the last 10 year market rate of return Apple stock is worth $49 based on a future cash flows, but if you take the last 50 years, Apple stock shows a valuation of about $150 on current cash flows based on the past 5 years net income growth rate. This stimulus is not helping, inflation is running away and it is being written down as something else.. Shareholders are trying to run away from the stock with this knowledge in hands, but will have no way to fix the lurgy as that will take Apple below book value and then be asset stripped"
The 1.9 trillion fiat debasement is a 15% M2 hammer. Apple will not increase business 15%.Bitcoin is Apples only hope
Some AAPL chart technical analysis for you. Look at the 3-month chart. The 50 day SMA is on an upward trend. The past 2 day’s candlesticks have long lower shadows (wicks) indicating a bullish setup. I think later today or beginning of next week we move up. Not an expert. Just my analysis and opinion. Good luck all!
Longs enjoy the comeback. Those who bought in the $130s and $140s and held will be rewarded. Apple  stock isn’t a slot machine! $200 by end of year
"The tech bubble is gonna burst, and when it does, true valuations will be realized! Many new investors will learn the hard way."
"Just some perspective. The last time Apple stock logged back to back green days in the Monday thru Friday trading week was Feb. 1, 2. That’s 6....6 weeks ago. If that’s not a sign of weakness, nothin is."
"Amazing how the 10 year is at 1.5 and the technology sector is getting killed because of it, before covid it was 2.5 and the tech did fine."
"One of the weakest today, I hope the trend will change."
"Joe can't even stimulate Jill. So, he sure can't stimulate the economy."
"Rates are priced in, Apples fundamentals are great and has a enough cash to buy entire countries. Buy and hold. 140 by end of next week!"
GO Apple ! You longs need to support your company
"These are just the days that remind me why I kept adding to $AAPL, $FB, $CNK, $SDC, $VGAC and $CCL... and why I decided to buy $HOTH, $RKT, $ZM, and $REGN... I took the afternoon off to sit by the ocean in Glosta and catch up on some reading!! What a glorious spring day! God is VERY!"
News Alert we had a backyard barbecue last month
You just witnessed the high in the S&P 500 for the year. All down hill from here.
I find it pretty laughable that the bots and sheep on this board are pushing the Apple is done for .. weak quarter... blah blah blah... the only factual information we have on the quarter is cutting production of the iPhone mini. That does not mean poor quarter. My theory is that this is due to the Qualcomm chip shortage. They can't keep up with Apple's needs so Apple had to make the tough call to focus chip orders around the premium high margin phones and cut back on the lesser demand iPhone mini. I could be wrong.
"regardless of all the negative comments, apple is still at 488.52 pre split. I thought 200 was great."

"I know it’s very frustrating to see profits disappear on a daily basis, I am one of the many AAPL investors who are frustrated, I know one thing about a top company as Apple and that is that IT WILL BOUNCE BACK. Patience will pay off in the long run."

"i hate Elon and wont invest one cent in tesla,i dont invest in arrogant narcissistic ceos,and most tesla unbelievers like me say its so over valued.i ran my simple formula to judge companys with no earnings on tesla and lightspeed for comparison.(yes i know Tesla makes + eps and lightspeed doesn’t)but tesla didnt up till last year,and its still a good comparison of apples to apples.tesla. sales or revenue in 2020 was 31.536 billion and its mrk cap is 628.58Blightspeed. sales in 2020. 175.6 million. and mrk cap is 8.2BApple. sales 294.14 billion. and mrk cap is 2.01 trillion so using the 20 rule - over 20 is pricey,under is value. tesla =20.26 roundedLSPD= 46.70apple=6.8its hard to use p/e ratios when companies make no or little +eps.they try -eps but thats not a good comparison,and most dont list -eps anyway.apple is a mature company and so the 20 rule means less since its valued on profit eps but Tesla is only a baby in making +eps so saying its got a 1200 p/e ratio is really misleading.if Tesla was still -eps and they made 31.53 billion last year and is projected to make 48.11 billion in 2021 (52% increase) and 62.73 in 2022 (30% increase) it really doesnt look to expensive does it.especially when you consider LSPD 20 rule ratio is more than double Teslas.20 rule. market cap divided by sales or revenue for the year.$LSPD. $AAPL. $TSLA"
The open looked like a recovery trade day but tech is coming back up.
A lot of new iPhones to be purchased with stimulus--thanks taxpayers!
Now $119.99 plus tax.
Barron's reports AAPL cut production of I-Phone mini amid lackluster demand for low-end 5G phone. Not sure if that's a negative - maybe it indicates stronger demand for higher end phone.
Seasoned investors hold APPL long term and don’t freak out on a stock forum every single time the markets drop.
I have the ability be patient. That's why I'm rich. Apple and patience go hand in hand. The most successful investors are patient. The posts on this MB are indication of how unsuccessful these posters are.
So funds and MM can do anything? This is a banana republic??? 8 hrs of momentum just gone in 10 mins....thousands of SEC people are sleeping???
Market Timers fail(reduced returns) 72% of time with cap gains tax included and other transaction costs its 84%......and all u need to do to avoid this is.....drumroll....nothing
I like how the comments shift when a stock price shifts... From Negative to positive and the other way. In every forum the same. It shows that people still invest with emotion.
"Apple stock better find some good news, better find some gains, better find a way to stop the bleeding. Other tech stocks are leaving apple in the dust since the stock split. Now a reckoning at $120 with the potential for much more bleeding if the markets decide some give back is in order. Oh, yeah...the $300 million judgement doesn’t help the short term. I see frustration mounting from longs."
"It's funny, aapl had a tremendous Q4 and its stock went down and kept going down since then and yesterday it had bad news that would cut the production of its new baby, the cheapest one, and the stock goes up. "
good opportunity to buy. Apple is a great company and long term hold.
"Apple's performance in the latest quarter showed strength in all product categories. The recent release of the 5G-enabled iPhone 12 family led to a 17% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales. Likewise, Apple's latest M1-powered MacBook models caused Mac sales to surge 21% year over year. And services revenue jumped 24% year over year, driven by strength in App Store sales, advertising, and cloud services. For more hot stocks like (AAPL) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
Oof I bought 125 calls that expire friday. all hope lost? lol
Own AAPL don't trade it.
"This week has traded according to previous discussed behavior patterns,Have a nice day.HIgher prices await"
I will make it short and to the point. Tomorrow’s closing for AAPL is  $2+.
Projecting $400 by year end 2021 but if we get to $399.99 I will still be happy. Yo ladies and gents what do yo think of my analysis. Thanko
because a stock keeps going up isnt considered research or investing

I will be by stocks that I believe in. This is one of them and still amazing price. Not some drive by stock up and down. This stock will be 200 by the end of the year. Rest will crash.
Good luck today lads.
buy buy after hours. FACEBOOK popped 4% today. Expect AAPL to pop even higher next week. GAP-UP on Monday. I am accumulating. Expect AAPL 200 level will come
"There you have it, AAPL was in a downward trend for weeks. I sold yesterday, it goes up!"
Why is Apple tanking today??
Should test $110 or lower in a week and close below $100 before April.
Northbound this week
Such a game. I really need to learn to ignore this on a daily basis
"Huge earnings, huge pullback, dividend, world’s best EV on horizon. Look for months of uninterrupted upswing now. Enjoy!"
apple will close on the high of the day. Friday's trading was once in a 150 sessions.
Stimulus rally is on and will continue this whole week!
"Apple is the only Stock I feel safe with, even when I bought it at 135 and watched it go down to 119. It never disappoints in the long run. Did I wish my entry was at 119, of course. But I still feel like I am with a winner even I have to wait one year for it to come back."

"Anyway the price is already six months the same. You can sell now, buy something else, make some money and return back here to buy apple in september 2021 and price will be the same. Why waste your time and money for nothing on apple. There are some others opportunities growing every day."
