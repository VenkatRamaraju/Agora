Recent headlines and conversations for UNH
"As a consumer of various HMOs over decades, I can tell you that UNH has by far the best customer services. It made me want to research investing."
Wow was up 7.00 briefly but as usual the sellers can’t help themselves and started selling again now only up 4.50. 4.50 is really nothing when a stock is down 28 in a week
Typical light trading decline continues today...
"Let's take a look at the government-run retirement program and see how it's working out? Oh, is it running out of $$$? Cool. Let's have another deficit generating public healthcare program."
"The market makers did it again, pull down early and accumulate it for the next few days."
Signature Wealth Management group news drops the hammer on the buy button.
"Cramer is an expert in calling the top. When he says buy, just know that the stock will start declining. He is always late to the game"
Poor Bill Johnson sold for a loss last week
"Just algos selling all health care related stocks due to headline risk from Sanders the pipe dream man. This is not only UNH. ANTM, CNC all selling off"
Everyone is up except for the banks and healthcare.
People selling because of talk of Medicare for all is dumb.
"Opps, feel the burn lol"
pathetic
"I find it amazing that a single person, Bernie Sanders can bring down the entire Health sector by pushing for a single health payer, the government. Market should always dictate the cost/price of anything in a free fair society. More government control equals greater taxes, paid by middle America. I wonder what happens when middle American dries up. We all we know shortly. I wish now I had worked in the Government as they hold all the cards for free healthcare, nice lucrative retirements, great pay (Sanders wealth is in the 1% go of Americans) and void of the laws they pass, they are exempt. Perhaps explains why we are seeing more illegals - it’s about the vote to keep one in office for life. Power money greed in our elected government officials."
Buy at 200
"Funny thing happens that every body can see, the chart readers bets on UNH down but some value players push it back up. I will wait till the selling side subsides down, which I think they will make a fortune if UNH downs to 235. I think UNH is too good in the next two weeks if they can not push down another few sessions, UNH will rebound strongly."
"one step forward, 10 steps back. great"
Buying opportunity for sure. UNH is nearing its 52 week low again. When trump is re-elected and fear of free healthcare dissipates this will be be $275+ in no time
"Optum gains offset rising COVID costs for UnitedHealth, driving solid fourth quarter earnings and a robust 2021 profit forecast."
Feel the Bern....
"Careful. Head and shoulders pattern completes at 237. Break under 237, look out below."
$3 from 52 week low.
This stock was once again worst performing HMO stock. Not even close. Should be removed from Dow Jones
"Humana..has awaken... SELL, SELL, SELL!"
Heading back up.
Those earning crushed it! Revenue will come back...$600/share by Nov!
"Raise your hand if you sold below $217 today.... Now that it is raised, go ahead and smack yourself..."
"It's the whole sector. The Democrats are foaming at the mouth about what they want to do with our health care system and that's STATE CONTROL. I'd be a buyer but, those people actually frighten me. And, it seems like it's most of them. You can look all day but, you will be hard pressed to find a moderate Democrat."
What a looser stock .Dead money until elections are over
I guess that's what you get for raising revenues guidance eh??
This junk is overvalued
This should have split by now!
"Bernie and that goof AOC are now yapping about Uber and credit cards, maybe they can shut up about healthcare long enough for this to go back to normal levels."
Rotation $ moving into tech. This drop is a bargain before earning. Believed it
When the board suddenly floods with shorts.... That's the buy signal...
Look out for 305 - 310 today!!!Don't bet against United States of America!Don't bet against UnitedHealth! (Bernie did and failed!)
I just canceled my United Healthcare Medicare coverage because my gym membership costs more going through UNH as opposed to my regular membership costs. How screwy is that? Goodbye UNH......
It's like people don't understand how this works. Have you seen the price targets? Let's keep a nice eye on who is buying and it will tell you all you need to know....
It is wonderful time of the year to buy UNH. The market makers will suppress the price today and hand to the hedge fund at the close.
"UNH was cruising 250's waiting on earnings...and after earnings with the impressive full year profit guidance should've been a green light on its way to new highs. The tabloid media with bernie fantasies interrupted it breifly,... UNH back on course."
Closed on the lows of the day. Once it breaks 220.00 tomorrow it’s straight to 205
UHG preparing to be the single payer option...own it all and buying up thousands of physicians thru OptumCare
"Betting Bernie flops tonight. Not ready to go long on this stock, so sitting it out for a bigger dip. Just not expecting that to come from the Bernie effect. IMO Bernie Sucks."
"UNH is down 0.28% and Yahoo has a headline running ""United Health plunges""?? What is up with these idiots at Yahoo."
"Traded down and then up on very light volume. No way indicative of which way it will ultimately trade once the regular traders come back to the markets, most likely next week. My bet is down as the momentum players have lost interest. Shorts will rush in on any sign of weakness. I am among them already. No interest in going long until at least a 10% correction."
Over $160 before end of this year $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ GLTA
Buying tomorrow’s dip
The price will be depressed because the hedge funds want to buy it low. This stock deserves to be around 260-270 since reported earnings.
"The recent sell off was ridiculous, but grateful for the opportunity to add shares! Great stock!"
"I guess they're loving sugary drinks and semis today. All the major Healthcare and biotech ETF's are in decline. XLV, IBB, BIB, this is across the board. Big boys are taking em to the woodshed!"
Low volumes last week...Looks like people stay in wait and see mode for earnings...Let's hope it will pop to 315-ish after earning report...
The seller is relentless here
Shes swinging.
52 wk high!!!
"Will there be a ton of buying tomorrow to drive this up, up, up in anticipation of awesome ER only to pull the rug out in after hours and Wednesday?? Or will this just keep heading back up where it belongs?? Heavy hitters love to manipulate stocks. #$%$ me off."
The stock is up from 208. Just a minor correction?
Thinking about buying more shares while it’s on sale
Panic? I would not call it a panic. The selloff started on Monday and will continue for the rest of the week before we know all of the AMZN plans.
The junk should go under IMHO
"Wow, thanks for unloading, what a buying opportunity"
have been expecting a big sell off into close....not yet!
Sell program in this stock ever day at the open. I mean every day. Unreal
UNH ridiculously oversold again.
"A 50% Fib retracement from it's ATH levels will take us to the 170s. With these drops, it's likely to get there over the next several months. Great buying opportunity is coming, just need to stay patient folks."
$200 buy coming prior to election
AMZN can disrupt UNH only when it will have healthcare business established. Medicine selling/shipping business may not be able to compete with UNH's OptumRx
"Small consolation, the dividend is paid today. Bright side"
Sold at $255 yesterday after getting in at $212 thanks to churn after Q1 earnings.Moved proceeds into MGLN as more near term upside as UNH looks range bound for a while but it will eventually trade on fundamentals and $300 early 2020.
first time buyer today. been on my radar a while.. was wating for 230.. def got my wish today though I def bought too early today. Bernie the clown won't even win the primary. Democrats are doomed next year. Noone wants these socialist ideals
with this rate of drops we'll be in the teens in a couple weeks
Stop your fretting.... UNH is as solid as it can be... You'll see.
"This should be back up to $270.00 by the end of next week, right? No reason not to go back, is there?"
"BUZZ-UnitedHealth's recent letter to drugmakers misunderstood by market - analysts9:45 AM ET, 02/11/2019 - Reuters** Analysts say a letter sent by UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx unit to major drugmakers requesting seven quarters of notice before making list price reductions has been misunderstood** Shares of UNH, Cigna Corp and CVS Health closed down 1-3 pct on Friday** The share move, according to analysts, was in response to a brokerage note that disclosed OptumRx's recent letter** Analysts say the letter raised concerns that recent proposal by the Trump administration to overhaul drug rebate rule could hurt pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) more than expected** ""We believe the letter merely anticipates the possibility of historically unprecedented drug list price deflation"" - J.P. Morgan analysts** Contrary to reporting, understand that UNH sent the letter in December, before the proposed rebate rule was released - JPM** SVB Leerink analysts say that Friday's sell-off is a buying opportunity after the brokerage's conversation with UNH management"
UNH is down 4.91% to 233.95
This stock is sick
can we just have one decent fn week???!!!!
I just saw a headline on FBN about a brokerage lowering their price target on UNH. Anyone else see that?
RUN AWAY!
"They have over $40B in retained earnings, billions more paid out in divs, even more billions paid on exec bonuses, advertising, marketing and administrative expenses.How can sick people possibly support all of this?It's completely upside-down. It's the sick people we should support!"
This stock has a lot of grounds to cover to recover what it had lost. Let’s see where it ends from here.
"I had to get my right knee replaced and UnitedHealthcare did an awesome thing for me and my family. they let me make payments. additionally the next closest competitor insurance company for healthcare wanted about 20 to $30,000 more for that same surgery. thank God for competitive capitalism in this country. otherwise I'd still be riding one of those little self-propelled wheelchairs at Walmart to buy a gallon of milk. no kidding."
How do I find earning date of UNH? Thanks
Does anyone know why we dropped $15?
Breaking News: Amazon Berk JPM health plan shutting down...
will it reach 240 today?
52 week ath
PEG still below 2 along with massive moat from Optum given the health insights it gets from patient health habits and healthcare spends. Don't listen to posters who think healthcare for all will happen.
friend at ubs said ---you could see a price target at $350
"It is so cruel when the market makers press down UNH from $3.74 up in the morning down to less than one point, then accumulate the shares handing it to the big boy. I expect to see UNH 255 by end of the month."
overpriced
"IMO the houses are intentionally ratcheting down these companies ahead of their earnings reports which start up next week. I've been taking a bath in amgn, regn, biib, nvs, and unh. All will probably knock the sock off when they report and the big boys just want them cheap before they report. This is how they operate!"
Cheap stock. Severely undervalued fair value 310.
"Monday Market closed, Tuesday earnings wow"
So who won? Guess investors won cause we bought it at 259!! Haha bunch of shorts
Beat beat raise guidance
Health Care sector is so safe and conservative. I believe that it will not move lower much than this. It is already go down over 15%.
just a little correction. don't panic
Seeing a breakout
Long and Strong. Bought the May 230's on the close Fridays. The charts in no mans land.......means nothing to me......The fundamentals are what will drive us back to 245 -265 by end of next. all the chatter is simply a buying opportunity for anyone with any foresight. This qtr does Mather and until guidance is truly qtr over qtr stable we be making on the swings.
Looks like it is trying to bounce back today. Hope it does.
"lower, lower lower lower. No buyers here. Funds don't want this at $230's"
"Another day the green., In the long run Fundamentals always come out on top."
Goldman fraud
This stock is bound for $400 this winter.
Hope they are buying back this stock

This stock sucks @$$$$&
"I think UNH will reach 260+ by this week when Jay Powell announces that he can be patient. He knows that he screws up the senior retirement account for more than 3 trillions when he set auto pilot program last year. I believe that he will never raise the interest rate this year because he saw the disaster that he created. FDX already feels that the interest rate hurts so many emerging countries which sent the boomerang disaster back to the US. Wait till Trump makes big U-TURN about China Tariffs, we will see Dow 30,000 this year. then Jay can raise the interest rate."
Totally broken stock. Dow up 210 and this stinking garbage is down again
250 250 250 250 coming back
Any thoughts on new dividend amount?
UNH beating earnings reports the 20th
Surprised this happened again today.
UNH nice breakout over 164 looking strong!!!
Trump seems to be his own worst enemy in his 2020 reelection attempts. Dems just got another leg up on the back of his latest tariffs. Medicare for All here we come.
Just heard on CNBC that Joe Biden is against Medicare For All because it would eliminate private insurance companies. I just bought more of UNH.
A two and a half percentage point gain and all the whiners are quiet. lol
UNH is up 5.54% to 232.80
Must be the Medicare for all effect
Big rally tomorrow
"So...........why the weakness? My guess, money is being put to use elsewhere for a while until the next quarterly result gets closer when the stock will be $320ish."
What is our catalyst for the next move higher?Analysts mostly agree this is 20% undervalued Medicare FA is in the rear view The recent reporting was solidDoes UNH have Covid?What am I missing?
Dividend tomorrow 
The machine learning isn’t so bright.
Even after raping people on their premiums they still earned less. Just take a look. https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/content/dam/UHG/PDF/investors/2018/UNH-Q4-2018-Release.pdf
Liberals beating the MFA drum again....not sure there are even enough trees to grow all the money they want to spend
UNH is do for a $400+ run up.
"""UnitedHealth boosts 2019 profit outlook on strength in insurance, pharmacy benefitsUnitedHealth beat estimates for quarterly profit and raised its 2019 earnings forecast on Thursday, buoyed by strength in the largest U.S. health insurer’s pharmacy benefits management business and its insurance plans.The company is the first health insurer to report quarterly results after the Trump administration last week nixed an ambitious proposal that would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients.Sales in UnitedHealth’s main business of selling health insurance plans rose nearly 6% to $48.59 billion in the second quarter.Revenue from the Optum unit, which manages prescription drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics services, rose 13.4% to $28.03 billion.The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $14.70 and $14.90 per share, from an earlier forecast of between $14.50 and $14.75 per share.Net earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $3.29 billion, or $3.42 per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $2.92 billion, or $2.98 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $3.60 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.45, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Total revenue rose 8% to $60.60 billion, topping estimates of $60.55 billion.Shares of the industry bellwether rose 1.7% to $271.15 in light premarket trading.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/unitedhealth-earnings-q2-2019.html"""
$350 stock on sale for $300
Testing the mid April low... Hold Fast.
240 may be a good entry point.. after the market throws it's little tantrum.
Lowering my cost basis today. Bought in the 230's originally.
Can it go to $234.00 today ?
"Two notes from Credit Suisse. #1Next Steps in the Courts: Opening briefs were filed with the Court ofAppeals on Monday. Our Washington consultant notes that the court leansquite conservatively. In our consultant’s view, this case will likely go to theSupreme Court on appeal sometime during 2020, where the ACA wouldlikely be upheld. This is consistent with the view of Professor Neil Siegel,who we hosted for a conference call in December. Mr. Siegel was unsureabout how the Court of Appeals will rule, but he believes that this is theweakest court challenge to the ACA to date, and the Supreme Court hasalready upheld the ACA against two previous court challenges. The fivejustices who upheld the ACA (including Chief Justice Roberts) remain onthe court at this point. In fact, Mr. Siegel said that the likelihood of theSupreme Court upholding the District Court’s ruling is “close to zero.”#2.CNC and Some Hospitals Are Most Exposed Among Our CoveredCompanies: Hospitals have not disclosed their ACA exposure in recentyears. However, based on prior disclosures, we estimate low teenspercentage EBITDA exposure to the ACA for CYH (both Medicaidexpansion and public exchanges) and 3-7% EBITDA exposure for UHS,HCA, and THC. Among our covered MCOs, CNC has the largest exposureto the ACA (both public exchanges and Medicaid expansion). MCOs withfairly limited exposure include ANTM (Medicaid expansion and exchanges),CI (modest exchange exposure), and UNH (Medicaid expansion). Weestimate HIX and Medicaid expansion together likely contribute close to40% of earnings for CNC, 3-4% of EPS for ANTM, and less than 1% for CIand UNH. HUM has no meaningful ACA exposure. In addition, the DistrictCourt’s decision would end all other ACA provisions such as closing theMedicare Part D donut hole, as well as the health insurer fee."
"Very time Matt and Eric starts bashing, I make money going long."
Tuesday will be big for UNH with earnings and just as important will be forward guidance. If it can go down $12 in a day it could pop up $12 on good earnings and guidance.
Look at a chart for the last 10 days. Draw a line across the bottom and you will see higher lows hit 4 differant times and the uptrend is in place. Buy the October $240.00 calls
Finally a new high! Haha
"Good, up 10 points. I need some of the profit from UNH to pay my healthcare premiums that are ridiculously high."
Bernie has pulled UNH from $302 back to $277
Yesterday was a dead cat bounce.
UNH is down 7.02% to 227.07
Why is this down $18 in the premarket ?!!!!
This is just not a good stock. It’s just awful

"As much as I think healthcare for all would socially be great there just isn't anyway this is going to happen anytime soon and maybe never. The federal deficit is already severely under water and there is really only two ways to fix it. Raise taxes... not happening or cut entitlements. We can't grow our way out of this trillion dollar deficit Trump has put in place. So, how in the world can we afford healthcare for all when we can even fund Medicare and Social Security as it exists today. Wake up politicians and stop with the B/S on healthcare."
"UnitedHealth: A Great Buffett-Style Blue Chip BuyApr. 17, 2019 7:00 PM•UNHSummaryI'm a big proponent of buying blue-chip dividend growth stocks when the market hates them most.UnitedHealth recently crashed to a new 52-week low, due to heightened (but likely overblown) regulatory/political risks.While regulatory/political risk is something all healthcare investors need to be comfortable with, UnitedHealth enjoys a wide moat, excellent dividend safety, and world-class management.Today, this level 11 (out of 11) quality SWAN stock is trading at a 1% to 26% discount to fair value and likely to deliver 13% to 20% CAGR total returns over the coming five to 10 years.Just remember that risk management is paramount, so keep your position size and sector exposure to reasonable levels. I and Simply Safe Dividends recommend 5%/25% position/sector caps for most investors.(Source: imgflip)After five years as a professional investment analyst/writer, I've learned a lot about what long-term investing strategies work well, which is why I've shifted my retirement portfolio (where I keep 100% of my life savings) to a pure undervalued blue-chip dividend growth approach.My specific approach is inspired by Warren Buffett's concept of ""fat pitch"" investing. That means only buying quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks, at good to great prices (estimated discount to fair value and preferably near 52-week or even multi-year lows), specifically when Wall Street hates them most.This helps not only minimize the risk of a permanent loss of capital (""rule #1 never lose money, rule #2 never forget about rule #1"") but also maximizes the chance of earning market-beating double-digit returns over time.(Source: Ycharts)Last week UnitedHealth (UNH) popped up on my watchlist after falling near its 52-week low. I set my limit orders and was thrilled to have one of them fill on Monday, April 15th, beginning a $2,000 starter position. During United's post-earnings conference call 10% collapse two more limits filled, tripling my initial stake while reducing my cost basis to $222.66.I would have bought four limits worth, however, that $6,000 investment in United Health raised my healthcare exposure (elevated after a total of $28,000 worth of healthcare deep value blue-chip buys in the last three weeks) to 21%, above my personal 20% sector limit.Thus, I'm now slightly overweight healthcare and will need to dilute down my portfolio with new buys in non-overweight sectors (anything other than energy, REITs or healthcare).So, let's take a look at why I'm such a fan of United Healthcare, especially now that it's 23% off its all-time high. More importantly, learn why Wall Street is so bearish on this blue-chip now, why those fears are likely overblown, and why I consider UnitedHealth a classic Buffett buy now. That's both under his famous advice to ""buy wonderful companies at a fair price rather than fair companies at a wonderful price"" as well as to ""be greedy when others are fearful.""Why The Market Is Worried About United HealthBlue-chips of United's caliber don't fall so hard and fast without the market being afraid of something. So, let's take a look at this health insurer's risk profile, so you can determine whether this dividend growth stock is a good fit for your portfolio.First, let's discuss the elephant in the room, and the cause of United's (and the entire health insurance industry's) big Tuesday intraday plunge. That was the result of what the CEO said during the latest conference call.The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best. And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs, all without fundamentally increasing access to care. The path forward is to achieve universal coverage and it could be substantially reached through existing public and private platforms. Meaningful progress in health care lives and national and state leaders continuing to work collaboratively with the innovative and proven private sector solutions to achieve the goals we all want, a modern, reliable, informed, and aligned health care system that offers the access, choice, and coverage protections people seek at a fair cost to the individuals and society as a whole."" - David Wichmann (emphasis added)What Wichmann is talking about is Medicare For All, which is the single-payer proposal first outlined by Senator Bernie Sanders in his 2016 presidential bid, but that's now being endorsed by numerous Democratic presidential hopefuls.The impetus for Medicare for All is the belief that if the US government becomes the sole provider of healthcare then it will be able to extract drastic price reductions, either through bulk negotiations or outright price controls. Given tha"
major players not letting this go above 237 for some reason.
ALL time highs 288 gave up 80 points almost 30% hair cut especially just reporting earnings raising profits guidance for the whole year..this isn't enron. lol I nibbled in some...and will add more over time.
No Bernie equals big earnings.
"we have to thank the bozos/democrats for the drop, pure manipulation"
it held 214. lets see what happens
"Who's holding for two weeks to get the dividend? You do know the democrat's debate is the day before... That's a double whammy, Ex-Dividend and Medicare for all Free-for-all... lol"

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elizabeth-warren-vows-first-nominee-140000156.html
UnitedHealth reached an all time high at 366.49

"bought 1k shares unh and sold after close for 1k profit. I will be kicking myself in morning maybe?charles, you like tsm or ms for thur morning?"
"Financially, UNH is doing fine. But, socially and politically, this company has not demonstrated its leadership in American Health Management. Quitting ACA is not an effective answer. From the short term profit point view, this company is well priced. For long term, I am waiting for the vision from this group, including this company."
Can this go beyond 310 today?
didnt anyone ask bernie if HE chose medicare? and all the rest of them on the premium health plans government makes available for them....then they can shop around for doctors willing to take medicare as payment.
all medicines are useless ... if you look at coronavirus ... these pharmars are cheaters
"Unh must have company specific issues as the other HMO s have started to stabilize and UNH is accelerating tontje downside. They are now the worst HMO stock. Humana, anthem and Cigna are much much stronger. This is now a broken stock that failed a breakout"
Still gap wide open from 155.18 to 152.85
UNH has been in a down trend since December ... Trump can ruin almost everything with his tweets ~
Nice lift
wish idiots would stop clogging up legitimate posts
Damn day traders tryna cover their profits haha
Closed at 400.31!!!First ever closed above 400!
$254. That is where UNH would jabbed to trade at today to be equal to the move Cigna has made the last 3 days. Cigna up 10.5%. This stock is watered down Dow industrial garbage
Daniel....get a life dude!!!!!
WHAT DOES A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY DO BESIDES STEAL MONEY FROM POLICY HOLDERS?
OPTUM's PBM causes damage to WBA today. It really surprises me that WBA drops 10% premarket. It is a big haircut.
Market makers playing options games to pad their pockets. Buying more at a discount.
Same earnings growth as Microsoft. Crazy it's got a forward pe of 13.
UnitedHealth reached an all time high at 323.69
HAHAHAHHAHAHA
UNH reaches new all-time high because the fear of a Democrat winning the presidential election this year is all comfortably gone.
"Health care has been under fire by trump. Honest opinion, don’t think much can be done about Obama care other than lowering prescription drugs."
It's going to near 210 by the end of the week
New 52 week high. Nice
junk run out of steam?
Pulled the carpet out at EOD!!!!
Only the companies that have contributed to the OPIAD mess should have gone down today...….I wouldn't touch UNH as much as I would love to sell the PUTS here...….The IHF ETF is also poison...….I feel bad for the longs in stocks like CVS who got an upgrade today to a $74 stock price......Some justice......
Looks like its headed to $236 again!
"don't feel bad for the ones that sold , it was only on paper"
nice little day today! hope it continues.
"If the Republicans had done their jobs over the past 8 years, they could have had a health plan to replace Obamacare. Instead, they did nothing for 10 years(!) and that's how people like Bernie Sanders get so much support. When a family can't afford health insurance for their family, they will vote for the likes of Bernie Sanders. Republicans once again shot themselves in the foot by failing to have a plan for affordable health insurance."
Why all these #$%$ publishing negative reports?
"These goofs aren't scaring me out of healthcare. I don't care how many times Bernie says Medicare for all. None of them have a chance to win or sign any of this into being. Just goes to show you how stupid our country is, people selling on news that kinda maybe perhaps most likely will never happen. wth."
Nice plug for UNH in Barrons. Could help start next week off in the right direction. https://www.barrons.com/articles/health-insurers-anthem-cigna-humana-cvs-unitedhealth-stocks-look-like-a-buy-51555698489?mod=hp_LEAD_1
Let's close above 300 today
"Sanders is a fan of Cuba...just think about what he will do to the US especially if the Democrats can flip the Senate as well. So if he is going to win the nomination, the safe way is to vote Republicans into both houses..."
Bull trap or this is closing at 230 today.
I bought 1 share with my Medicare refund 
From a nice gain to a six percent loss? What in the world happened?
I really wish it goes up! Netflix destroyed me
"Up 50 a share since the summer, easy bull"
Thinking of just selling my UNH and CI and taking a loss. I'll just buy GOOG instead or CRM.
"280 is very possible for UNH on Oct 16. The rumor estimate number is way higher than street estimate, plus tax cut will start to show the result making the actual number even higher."
"Last week's downdraft was the tell that fundamentals are now meaningless. I take no pleasure in saying I was right, but I was. Few institutions want to hold a stock now viewed to be of high risk when there are other, safer places to put their money. THAT IS THE PREVAILING PERCEPTION AND PERCEPTION IS ALL THAT COUNTS."
"It will turn green today, the market makers did it again. I don't see any reason why UNH will go down deep over one point early in the morning."
one day wonder the junk ... LOL i was squeezed
Pramila Jahapakl Democrat Washington is proposing a Medicare for all bill that is said to have a 100 democrats behind it. All HMO's are getting hit.
245.00 +/- .35 for the last hour. Wow could they make it any Korea obvious. Why isn’t this against the law ? The SEC is useless
Anthem is doing much better it’s down 1.22% stuoid UNH is down 1.95%. This stock is lousy
"One negative headline after another after another after another causing the second worst enemy of a stock..........fear and uncertainty. Every time it bounces back another headline hits. Pelosi and Trump discussing drug price reductions being the latest one today following Trump's attack on the ACA, etc., etc. From all the analyst notes I've read none of the headlines poses a legit threat since the legislation required to pass has little to no chance...........and neither does Trump's ACA lawsuit in the opinion of almost everyone.Does that matter to the market? Not one bit. Why? When negative headlines cross the computers say sell."
Maybe we can socialize everything we work so hard hard for
"""Health Care Sector Rating: Outperform. Brad Sorensen""The health care sector continues to be in the headlines, with announced Democratic 2020 presidential candidates often promising to rein in health care costs and increasingly pushing for “Medicare for all.” This appears to have contributed to recent heavy selling in the sector, surprising me as I still believe with the rancor in Washington, the risks of major legislative changes coming to fruition are low, and that investor fear of such is providing an opportunity for investors."" Of course No chance for ""medicare for all"" which the noise only created Buying opportunities. More analysts are hopping on to this reality of buying opportunity over media noise!"
"Didn't we have a democratic debate the evening before the last earnings announcement? What timing! And then there is the Faux Trade deal with China. With Mnuchin saying no tariffs come off before the election, this is the same stance that has sunk a deal before... Trump just won't budge. I don't expect much out of the deal, and now that the details are coming it out, it's going to be sell on the news. Already, the futures are down tonight as a result. Yes, I know UNH is not dependent on trade, but it does move with the Dow much of the time. So a bad market may mute the effects of a good earnings report, and add to that, the Bernie effect from tonight's debate, and all bets are off, as is my money for the time being. GLTA!"
Why the junk is up so much?
Any idea on new dividend?
I Love UNH
"Take your time today I think the market will tank today, so I will wait for the good price to buy. I believe it only hurts the bank sector, not the high tech. That is the reason, when Dow drops, you can see what the sector goes down, the banks, the tech sector is still hot and has the earnings season to prove that every thing is still in place. The rate goes down, but the health care has nothing to do with it. LOL"
Accumulating...
TBH profiting off ppl dying is probably the worst investment you can have..... not worth it..... Just sell and pick a more humane stock...
ridiculous
"Generally speaking I don't believe in accusations about stock prices being artificially manipulated to rip off retail investors. But what happened yesterday, in light on UNH's announcement today of a divi boost, is pretty remarkable. The market was up strong out of the gate yesterday so as a S&P component UNH participated, initially rising about $1.50. From that point it inexplicably dropped about $3.50, going red to the tune of almost $2 even as the market remained positive by around 200 points. Today it's looking to open around $9 above yesterday's intraday low. As they say.........there ought to be a law."
Patience.
"It is following the same pattern as yesterday....a drop at open, a bunch of down movemnet until 220 and then it gets bought only to sell off a bit at the EOD.....so following this pattern we'll open with a quick move down tomorrow."
healthcare is a big problem for US - cheating everywhere
Buy more as UNH has just triggered a buying point...https://www.investors.com/research/stocks-to-buy-dow-jones-stock-unh-buy-alert/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo
the stockholders are doing well but policy holders getting screwed big time
Wow that was ugly. Imagine what would happen if the market were to start going down a lot
210 a layup
Short covering coming... Enjoy the ride.
It traded for 247 after hours what is happening
"Going to be up over a percent today, let's go."
The junk rallied for days
"Stay the course, keep buying UNH OCT 250 call, I HAVE A DREAM."
"Please excuse the stupid question, has the ruling on the ACA been handed down yet? I thought a decision was going to be made by July-August."
Plz go back down to $257 :(
"Maybe Liberty will be the next BYND,,,,nah!!!!! come on Liberty"
On sale...
"extremely low volume today with this drop, nobody selling at this level, holding strong. Good sign we will get to $310 and eventually new highs very soon. This ER will be the catalyst.......$310 leading into ER season, and great numbers will take this to new high. $330 is my prediction!!!!!"
Mr. Witty was successful with Optum.He's a witty person to lead UNH.450 mid summer.
"Let's go UNH, into the green today. Old CVS is having a nice run-up, join them there."
what's happening ? all my favorites are going down this earning. feel like taking a break this earning season.
Sell sell
Give it about 6 months and should be back!
Bernie Sanders has no chance and no one that sticks to Medicare for all during the general election can beat trump. Whoever the democrats end up with that person will have to change course and go against Medicare for all
be buying
"Ding #$%$ Liz is nearly gone and Crazy Uncle Bernie wins in neighboring state.Look for Bloomberg, Mayor Pete, and Amy remaining after Super Tuesday."
Run Forrest Run !!
"Remember... For every seller, there is a buyer. This is a historic two day selloff, based on a rumor. When this reverses, it will leave the little investor that panicked on the outside looking in. ""Buy when others are fearful""."
Why is this stock going down when in fact they do not have any exposure to China?
States can regulate pbm reimbursement SCOTUS
This stock is about to get Trumped
Tech getting trounced....hi fliers and non profitable companies taking a hit. Banking Oil Airlines rising....bond yield going up. Inflation on the horizon. UNH is in a pretty good spot.
get ready to buy more...
"UNH and BA , will take DJIA to all time high shortly!"
The entire market is back to 1999-200 mode. Parabolic. All stock are parabolic. TSLA has went from 180 to 540. Yea that makes sense. Aapl has went from 150 to 315 without anything improving in their business whatsoever. Market is up 40PercentWith gdp up 2 percent. That’s nuts. Pump it 8-10 months before the election so you can crash it 2-3 months before the election
Sold most of my shares this morning due to negative reaction to earnings. Put proceeds into AMZN.
Down 24 in a week
UNH is up 4.91% to 259.63
Fair value $300.00 plus :)
I do like BDX here as well
I take back what I said about the shorts. This is computer driven algo program selling.
No news = gains! Keep ‘em comin’!
Going to 295-296 today to fill the gap.
"Besides 'missing' the obvious wrt nursinghome deaths...who is keeping track of those dying alone in their apartments? Some of that unpaid rent is not from a conscious decision not to pay. If the first known victim a 57 year old healthy female died alone in her apartment in Santa Clara, CA, you can BET there are alot of others, she was connected and a techie... but many are not. Demanding 'isolation' has other consequences. I ran into an elderly confused man sitting on a bench outside the local grocery store with 3 police trying to figure out what this well-dressed but basically incoherent man was doing there. I spoke to him. He was obviously emerging from his cocoon to seek help but fading in and out of coherence. The police were not wearing masks or gloves. Bad sign."
again another rally of 2% with no news.
Will probably move up 50 pots in a few days when it turns positive
Trying to break out everyday......gets to $110-$111 in early trading then drops back down to $105-$107. Repeat and Repeat! Low volumes everyday so once we flush out profiteers and day traders UNH should bounce higher after such a good ER.Let this run to $315 and then $330 and stop trading for a few dollars.
"Yahoo needs to stop letting these damn bot accounts post to multiple boards. Just remove stock ticker tagging for now, Yahoo, #$%$!"
"1Q19 EPS, Up 23% Y/Y, $0.13 Ahead of Consensus. UNH reported 1Q19EPS of $3.73, $0.11/$0.13 ahead of CSe/Cons.

Witty is very witty leader. He will be good to lead UNH.
I WANT GET MY NEW CAR HELL YEAH
Medicare for all wouldn't be truly implemented for at least 5 years from now. Who even knows if a democratic socialist will win the election. This is so overblown
"as of now, it is below the lowest analyst estimate"
wow why the drop?
where is USA?
"Does anyone seriously think that Americans, even most Democrats will vote for a policy that forbids them to buy their own healthcare if they choose to? Not in this lifetime, I say."
We love today’s steadily strong chart! UNH is heading north from here!
"Keep riding the wave, I think UNH will be green at the close today. I have to give the market makers today that can keep UNH in check, not run away like last week."
"Time to lock in profits ?""Bernie Sanders to Unveil ‘Medicare for All’ Bill as a Marker in 2020 Race""Bloomberg Bloomberg•April 10, 2019"
Socialism won't work ... Sanders su*ks
Who's DRIPing their dividend here? Major stock purchased happening tomorrow.
Going to be a wild ride today with Quadruple Witching!
If 229.30 breaks this week(likely Monday lol) then this stock is going to 225 then 220. This stock is a mess
"UNH continuing to donate money. Maybe cover for a large ER. Don't want to be the bad guy. Next quarter, different as claims return. My $ .02."
Sad about unh? Just look at hum & smile bc hum is way up. Eventually all pbm will follow. It’s 100% proven
so many upgrades but still couldn't brrakthru 300. :-$
National corruption in healthcare ... this needs to be fixed!!!!!!!!!
Sell sell sell !!!!!
Rumor on UnitedHealth merger buying THChttps://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20190225/NEWS/190229945/tenet-in-exclusive-talks-over-potential-conifer-deal
a Hillary win is going to kill this sector
any news why UNH is down over $7 this morning?
going up with the tide; no reason not to breech 235 and 240 soon.
UNH is up 8.28% to 248.50
Here's the issue: virtually all trading is done by computers. Warren is a moron and it's widely known that Wall Street will not contribute to the Democrats (and may even switch sides and contribute to Trump) if she is nominated. So why don't the bankers take autopilot off and start buying UNH (especially at this basement price)?
Will healthcare stocks get a boost after Trump’s tariffs threat?
Bought some today along with a lot more CVS.
What is going on today with UNH?
Markets down on manufacturing decline. UNH not adversely affected by manufacturing decline. Should be considered a safe haven by many and perform contrary to the general market.
Down over 5% over the past 3 months. Still getting squeezed.
Not likely to hold 295 today. Too top heavy right now. Sell any rally.
Sliding down more ... here comes AMZN !!!! Jump jump jump and get your profit
"Sanders claim of Medicare for all is misleading. Medicare benefits are more generous because it covers older Americans who by and large worked many years and paid Medicare taxes for many years working and plus they are a large voting base who turn out to vote so politicians don’t mess with this group health benefits.What Sanders is describing would actually be less similar to Medicare and more like a stripped down Medicaid health insurance and really be a downgrade in coverage for most. Over 50% of Americans have private health insurance and I doubt they want to trade that in for a inferior “Medicare for all” plan, which by the way no politician or government worker will participate in because the benefit sucks so bad. So I doubt the current Medicare aged, working private insured, or government employed want this. The country is at a tipping point where we either keep our freedom and choices or become like a animal the government feeds, clothes, and takes care of until we die. I will not cast a vote for any candidate that’s robs me of free choice, thanks but no thanks Bernie!"
Take your 3000 tax deductible and sell this garbage. Nelson Peltz should be in jail
BOYS....I LOOK FOR A HOOK UP WITH WALLGREENS...STAY TUNED !!!
Ben G is a moron
"It's not down! By hey, the day is young."
"this is crazy, thanks dems.. talk about manipulation"
"Here is what is comical about the medicare for all situation. Even if the bill could somehow pass (which it will not). You think the best run healthcare company in the world, with excellent management will not construct an agreement for a massive government contract? A government run medical system for all would be bad for small medical companies, not for UNH. Look at the defense sector for example. Do the best and biggest companies (Lockheed, Raytheon, Northdrop) not get all the money funneled right to them? Change or threat of change is bad in the market, but this is a homerun play long term, regardless of short term pressure."
Job data is good. Trump looks like the president for 4 more years...this will continue to go north...
What just happened
Consolidating for a strong finish....
Hard working Americans will have an up roar if this comes to light.... it’s earned things/stuff isn’t a privilege.
"When there is blood in the streets- that is the time to buy. This company is insanely profitable, and at the epicenter of one of the most recession proof and stable industries there is. It’s down thanks to political noise. Anyone who buys now will be happy they did once the BS tsunami is gone"
"Remember when clone said:“THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUED UNDER PERFORMANCE IN A BULL MARKET IS THE CORRECTION IMPACT ON cvS/HIT. IT WILL GET HIT MUCH HARDER!”FACT, PHILOCHIT, AGE OKD PROVEN FACT"
"Obama care is in front of the Supreme Court. Fear of unknown, uncertainty about the decision is the reason stock is down"
Bloomberg will beat Sanders
"Pretty ridiculous how it's only when the obvious is stated through the right mouth that people wake up some. The medicare for all is blown out of proportion. At best, it could be implemented in 5 years. At best. But it won't even get passed soooo"
I SEE RED !!!! RED !!! DROP DROP DROP !!! DROP !! hit the market bottom ...
That a certain analyst wants to pull UNH in the mud cuz Liz thinks she will get 1 payor is wrong. Borsch downgraded big due to this. Didn’t matter the election hasn’t even started. Take it down when they miss. Oh— UNH doesn’t miss. Happy camper today.
Going green this week.
which stock UNH or HUM is the best to own should medicare for all fail and the status quo remains
"Thank the ""Medicare for all"" goofs. They want higher capital gain taxes and you can see what it will do to your investments right now. Just look at this."
What the deal with the conference calls and UNH!?
Resistance is yesterday's close. 220.96
"10% drop in 2days UNH, brutal. 22% drop since Oct 2018 high while the indices have recovered and reached all time high. That's how much health insurers UNH has lagged the market. $MOH, $ANTM"
Anyone ever been to a VA hospital? The care delivered to the veterans is horrendous. I imagine that would get even worse on a larger scale. This idea by Bernie is a joke at best.
I sometimes wonder at 18 times earnings is CVS health/Aetna a better buy at under 8 times EPS.
"NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) current average P/E=80NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) historical average P/E=12NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) is up by 150% in the Last 9 months, Despite TANKING Corporate Revenues, Collapsing Economy, Record High INFLATION, Record High Debt, Record Stock Dilutions and Deteriorating fundamentals! $GE $UNH"
"This smells funny, they must have caught Wichmann doing something wrongHe’s only been there 3 years and at 59 years old, I just don’t see itLove this space, I’m switching over to Humana. There management is superior"
All time high!
That’s it I’m out of his miserable stock. I will not stay in a stock that totally sits out two 300 point up days. I just can’t afford that. Good stocks might sit out one day but not both. Management is clueless here
"What is everyone’s prediction for today? I’m a big shareholder and I think we open green, go red and finish up 1%"
Same pattern two days in a row. UNH is up early in the morning and then down at the close. Let's see how the market makers manipulate this stock.
The manipulators sure have his stock in the penalty box and just won’t let it even bounce .50. Been down 3.00 for an hour with no ability to bounce. This is obvious manipulation to be able to control a stock like this. If this wasn’t a computer program then there would be some movement. It would be like driving a car on a 100 mile trip and not veering 1 inch from the middle of the lane. Impossible
Did muting me change the facts this stock was awful and I was just telling you people the reality. But cover your eyes and ears
Ten % over two days. Ouch.
A perfect combination when a company beats analysts earnings estimates AND raising outlook for the remainder of the year. The positive guidance is a green light to BUY for the investors as daytraders taking short term profits towards earnings release.
"04/16/2019 - UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is expected* to report earnings on 04/16/2019 before market open. according to Zacks Investment Research, based on 10 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $3.59."
If you think that the government can properly provide healthcare for all...go to a VA hospital. Then you can see first hand how this is a horrible idea.
shorted it at $270's. I'll buy it again soon. This pop didn't make any sense
Total bear raid
"The interesting thing about a morning like this is that all the bulls are in blue sky, no one is underwater (except maybe Dave Windley an analyst at Jefferies, who’s recent call on the company was.. well.....“” UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +2.78% was downgraded by Jefferies analyst David Windley, citing concerns over competition from Anthem Inc. ANTM, +1.70% and and margins related to Medicare Advantage pricing. Windley cut his rating to hold from buy, and dropped his stock price target by 22% to $235 from $300.Oct 10, 2019“” ) A whiff of fear can drop the shares $10 but, for the moment every bull is in the black."
UNH reached a 52 Week high at 290.79
"You know this thing is in trouble because every goof on the radio/TV is saying to buy the healthcare sector. Never listen to these fools, I give it a month at most and this thing will be back in the dump again. Be the first one out the door..."
"I just read article describing this as ""temporary downward pressure"". Does anyone have a clue what timeframe Temporary implies?"
what do you think is hurting UNH?
DRIPping 18 new shares today....and while the stock is downPerfect
"NYT Endorses Warren, and Futures are falling off a cliff tonight with China SARs virus emerging as a real threat. Going to be messy open tomorrow and UNH to take a major hit with the Medicare for All scare. Looking for ten percent drop in one day."
UNH heals people. BA drops them in the ocean. And which one is green? Go figure 
longs...don't sell today...
I think all the idiots that work for unh up in democrat land should go out and vote themselves out of work
Anybody know why the price collapsed in to the close?
270 now....300 by December
"BREAKING: Haven, the Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan venture to disrupt healthcare, is disbanding after 3 years"
"just maybe there aint a durn thing wrong with this stock. Temporary weakness does not reflect clearly on a valuable thriving company!! hold, and couple years from now, you will be a happy camper!"
420 by Easter.
UNH is a dumpster fire. This is the third huge up day this stock has basically sit out. Guess what happens when the market gives some or all of this rally back? 230 acometh
"Medicare for all is cemented in some form - the 2020 election is sealed with a resounding defeat for that shameless lout occupying the WH. It is for the Democrats to lose, because this pathological liar is finished. Facing Bernie in a debate, he will be chewed up and spat out like so much dross - he cannot string two coherent sentences together."
Anyone else think the price is being held down by concerns over costs related to the resurgence of COVID and the likelihood of a more severe second wave in the fall?
The market has spoken for me. I'm running while I can for now. Be back when it at least turns.
"Market up 150, UNH down $4 from the high. It's also down about $7 since Dec. 31 while the market is up about 900 points. I don't get it."
"I have had this on a watch list for a while. I think that Monday morning I will be a shareholder. It's on sale, so I'm buying."
When Obamacare was looming on the horizon HMOs gyrated too. Nervous Nellies. But Medicare for All is DOA....another Bernie bait for votes.
"What's up with UNH? Was down on Friday, not doing much this morning..."
Floor at 202
"Most own value stocks: UNH, V, HD, UPS, CAT"
Cigna is up 7% the last two trading days. UNH the hopeless pathetic dog is up less than 1% lolSeriously you guy are ok with this losing 40 a share then being unable to have a strong close . When is he last time his stock gained the last hour? Honestly I can’t rember once
"Got In at 61.00 with2000 shares, it’s doing great!"
UNH $8.40 cvS/HIT REDand you BAGGIES want to compare
"So far today only UNH, among the HMO's, is the only one doing anything because it is part of the S&P. Otherwise, $ is on the sidelines with CI, HUM, ANTM."
"Big Dip, what's going on?"
Urge sec investigation of naked short fraud here
Biden will announce his entry next week. Bye bye crazy Bernie. UNH will bounce back next week
Which of the three have the healthcare knowledge? The other guy's job always looks easier till you try it.
Beautiful
Thank you to that Citi analyst which caused this to fall under 260 so I could add another chunk
Bunch of chickens running like all insurances will cease to exist
Demorats #$%$!
Where is the support on this? Weeks of gains wiped in a few hours.
earnings on the 18th will tell the tale of this awesome stock!
sold
Lol there isn’t even anyone here to post about the stock lol. No wonder this stock is manipulated by the algos without any push back
under 270 and this will drop like a rock. 271.50 is the level it HAS to bounce from
233 close
Let's try to punch through 298 again today...
My break-even of $255 is looking further and further away
"From Credit Suisse..........A Favorable Outcome for the ACA in the SCOTUS Remains Possible According toSome Legal Consultants: As noted in the previous paragraph, four of the continuingJustices (Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer) have voted to support the ACA inprevious cases before the Supreme Court. Court watchers (and our key legal consultantregarding SCOTUS decisions) believe that Justice Brett Kavanaugh has a history ofsupporting the concept of “severability,” an approach that seeks to preserve as much of anexisting law, while removing only the flawed aspects (in this case, the individual mandate).ACA Exposure: We estimate HIX plus Medicaid expansion contributes roughly 26% ofEPS for CNC (post-WCG), 4% for ANTM, & less than 1% for UNH, CI, CVS, and HUM.CVS and HUM have no material public exchange exposure. Based on prior disclosures, weestimate low-teens percentage EBITDA exposure for CYH and 3-7% EBITDA exposure forUHS, HCA, and THC..........................................................................They estimate the EPS impact on UNH of a repeal of the ACA to be $0.11 or 0.7%."
"Some big blogs will come at the close, because UNH does not move at all today. I guess it will reverse at the close."
"Listen, Obama care is horrible. Not saying it isn’t."
"Bottom line on Medicare for all: will your doctor accept a pay cut by 30% ? Don’t think so either. Medicare for all, or even public options, will never materialize unless all doctors give that up. Believe it! That’s biggest barrier ."
Bunch of buy ratings yesterday with targets $300+
I just buy some of July 20 because I like the price panic today. I don't think at 242 I have room to hit JACKPOT on July 17.
One of the best health care stock that has consistency in earnings. On October 15 UNH will beat the earnings estimate again by at least 8-12 cents.
"This from The Atlantic citing a study by the Urban Institute that determines the cost of a Warren or Sanders Medicare for All at $34 Trillion over next decade (more than Medicare, Medicaid, and SSI combined today). This price tags closely aligns with earlier calculation by the CBO.https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/high-cost-warren-and-sanderss-single-payer-plan/600166/"
Best to have patience with this one. When we get the all clear...we can get back to new highs. gla.
wow peeps...
"56 Billion in gross profit! That is criminal and will lead to socialized medicine in this country. Millions are sick, millions have little or no health care because of the affordability, meanwhile rates keep rising while this company and its minions pocket 565 Billion dollars. I hate to see it but the only answer is for the government to take over health care, at least in health insurance, capitalism has eaten itself."
Free market capitalism has never been tested in the US. Medicare and Medicaid has inflated prices in healthcare for almost a century. If those programs were done away with healthcare prices would plummet making it affordable for most.
"this board's a joke, few on here have any fundamental understanding of supply and demand for stocks work. UNH is a well run company their historic record shows it, any dip is a buy and I'll never look at this board again as it is a mature hour a d a waste of time, you could mostly profit doing g the opposite of these idiots."
Look like UNH will surge to 14 points today. Who has the info. about what hedge fund bought in.
is asoko214 still on here??
"Ok, I put the cart before the horse a bit. Saw this bad boy down so much and swooped in with a decent buy. Now, whats the deal? Why is a monster like this doing so bad last couple days?"
Spoken like someone who keeps getting burnt on shorting the stock
"Clearly the noise in Washington is negatively impacting the managed care segment. Regardless, many including UNH have strong momentum and due to Obamacare dramatically less competition. Likely this is very short term. As for Medicare for all, just rhetoric to fire up the base. Likely it will never get out of conference for a vote. Plus, even if it passed UNH has no national competitor thus amazingly it would not hurt growth and profitability"
Why this junk is pumped?
Big guys are easily loading shares from weak hands before the ER next Tuesday. The weak hands never learn.
closing on to that magic number: $300
UNH has plenty of free cash flow to meet obligations. Analysts I have read don't really know how to analyze a high debt company with a high level of Goodwill to amortize. This is a buying opportunity as the company projects earnings of $3.30 a share for Q3 2018. Buy.
$5 off the high from yesterday because Bernie passed some gas. What a joke.
"Added more too early...oh well, holding long"
Breaking bud! Haha
Is UNH known for going down even after strong earnings? Thanks in advance!
"insane, I don't get the panic"
UNH is up 7.18% to 208.85
"Sure...hospitals full of empty beds, that should drive the price up."
Why why why is this atock acting as if it is an exporter of industrial products to China??????? This has become totally silly
Major companies like Amazon and JP Morgan are already self insured. Insurance companies like UNH merely administrate for these major companies because they are set up and can do it for less than if Amazon or Morgan were to take on that kind of task.
Like that shorties?
sold at 275 thanks for the chedda
short at 253.33 after sold ... bot yesterday near 246

Let’s just hope Millennials are smarter with healthcare dollars than Baby Boomers were with social security.
Humira and Cigna recovered for only 2ish % losses today. How does the best in the sector double that? Stupidity... Thats how.
"Another day of up , down and up?"
The seller is in total control of this stock. Management allows it. Looks like they would buy back some shares
GS crashed
Huge seller at 241.75 to 242.00. A virtual brick wall. They are smothering it daily
UNH has 0 hold ratings. Only buys and strong buys lol
nice gain today
will there be the usual late afternoon dump?
"Bernie Sanders has zero chance of being President of anything much less a lemonade stand, I'm buying on any pull backs of UNH"
"Over 700 $252.50 and $255, March 22 call options traded today...........about 350 each. If the market holds up perhaps it will close somewhere in the middle on Friday."
Imagine what happens to this pod when the market is down big tomorrow lol. Pos will be 240 that’s what
April 5 $247.50 call strike. Pretty good volume today. Maybe they're workin' it but they'll need the S&P's help.
"Under 5 points at the close, that I guess. UNH is held by mostly mutual fund."
There you have democrats all arguing over Medicare for all and. It even being able to agree. Total joke the way the market has basically elected Warren and already passed Medicare for all. Unions don’t want it. Doctors and healthcare workers don’t want it. Employees with good coverage don’t want it. And the millions and millions of seniors on Medicare do not want to give it to everyone

Funny that CVS is facing antitrust issues when UNH is 4 times the marketcap.
up up up in prehour trading. sorry mister shorty (eric).
Bought today. Trump is going to juice the market for re-election campaign by completing a China deal soon. All these noises around health care will be proven as nothing burger again
GETTING READY TO BREAK-OUT UP TO $300
Bernie didn't stand a chance last time and this time he has even less of a chance. Why would anyone cares what that goof says?
They missed from 81.8 to 81.9 seriously
No buyers whatsoever
The trading setup for UNH looks very enticing. have you guys heard of awesomeSTO-CKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
take a look at my call on the options............was one for the ages
The term: Medicare for All is a misnomer scam since there will be NO Medicare. It’s Single Payer.
Up or down on Scotus ACA ruling?
It’s a sell
"There you go, vote Democrat ladies and gentlemen. They will secure your portfolio. Profits and forward guidance is not enough now with these quacks running around. Pelosi, Bernie, AOC, Omar, they are our only chance for survival."
Who bought today at 295.70?! Sucks to be you!
Look like it is very interesting again for UNH at this price.
It's Anthem! Anthem reported poor earnings cause pin action against other names. UNH is in the process of recovering.
I had thought UNH was a nice safe position. Looks like Im being schooled again.
TOMORROW AM-We are going to beat handily. Trump and Biden will keep things the same. UNH now benfits from Pharma rebate and possible pricing heat on Big Pharma. Think we cross 270 by tomorrow and 280 by end of the week.

People just move on I hold 2 k share since 2006 & haven’t sold any. Been through it all. Don’t buy now bc boogie man will eat your $$. But rest assure it will shoot up again.
I will be very disappointed if UNH is not around 262-265 by second week of April.
"At this rate, UNH will be delisted in a month. Trump at work again. All gains are gone."
watch that 265!
We will see 200 or 195 next week before this settles
Debate tonight. And news of Bernie's push to solidify his lead with ground game in California. Beginning to look like he could run away with it. That momentum could carry through to the general.
The machines are in control today. Once the yield curve inverted the algos took over so it's all about the program trading. UNH holding up fairly well seeing as it has already been pounded down well below its real value............providing single payer does not come to fruition.
"Looks like it will be a sluggish day, but to anyone whose here, $CVS is still - down 5.92% YTD ($CI up 13.95% YTD, $UNH up 36.57% YTD, $HUM up $34.22% YTD, $ANTM up 15.24% YTD)- CVS has the lowest PE ratio of all healthcare stocks of 10x to 12x- Coming off consecutive great quarters and going to finish with a great year- new CEO - heavily involved in Vaccine administrationPrice should be ($5.45 EPS ex $2 Div times 18 to 20 times) = $100For those that believe in $CVS, please hold your position and let's make today a good day.Honestly everything else ... energy stock weed stock tech stocks are already overpriced... investors need to recognize the value here and keep $CVS going up today."
Another 52 wk high!!!Let's close strong...on the way to $400 next week.
Ok....typo...295 today...
"if this closes red today, it will be red tomorrow for sure"

"get out, bernie is projected to win big in cali and Texas."
Trade war started again and domestic health care will go back up this week lol
Sentiment is just awful here for HMO stocks and UNH is by far the worst performing stock. Yonwould hibk it’s stoc would perform a little better than peers since it’s the largest cap company but just the opposite
"Risk is factored in the every stock's valuation. In the market's opinion risk to the biz model has increased and thus the valuation is being reset. Most importantly, as evidenced by the volume spike over the last 5 days, money is coming out of the group.....not in. Buyer/seller equilibrium will be reached this week for the short term but I'm not sure anyone should expect a big bounce. The stock is now headline driven, not driven by EPS."
"CNBC interviewed an analyst who said she had a Buy on some of these stocks but, not to expect anything good from them for a long time..."
Idiot Cramer said sell this. He probably wanted to get in a little lower. Should be class action against him. If you always do the opposite of what he says you’ll get rich!
Just got an alert before the bell on UNH from (http://webstock.today). You think it will move the stock?
Why are we giving witt 2 years of continued pay as retired. What a bunch of crooked #$%$ he should be ashamed of ripping of the supporters of this company. Thief.
"Is this all being driven by the amazon / berkshire health insurance initiative? I am in @267, I'm thinking this sell off and sitting at $253 may be a great cost average entrance."
anyone thinking a small investor of maybe a 100 shares would be smart now?
"though it's up the volume is somewhat light. I closed my position, and this name may still do well but going forward it's not for me"
"As long as 250 acts as support for the next couple weeks, we are good. If it breaks, then it will likely be a start of a new bear market in UNH"
$235 end of week?
I put in buy order just in case super low
Feel the Burn
"Nothing screams capitalism more than when an insurance company rallies on news of less competition, i.e., Amazon wont sell drugs."
Great buying opportunity!!!!
"I wished my healthcare mutual fund didn't hold this junk. I can't wait until this goes up enough that I can get out. It's like being in purgatory. This sector is not safe as long as you have a bunch of clowns running for president. One goof wants to give away free boob jobs and hair replacement, smh."
"Just went Long 300 shares of UNH at $286.85. This is a Pure Earnings play. I am expecting a very good earnings release tomorrow morning, beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, to propel this stock up through the $290's and to the $300 level. Good Luck to All and we shall see what happens! :-)"
Market up UNH down. Market down UNH down. Bearish direction short UNH on any pop
UTX is due for a turn around ... everything is affected by Trump's tweets!
What a coincidence that the stock gravitates right to 245.00 once the close is in sight. Didn’t matter if the Dow is up 1000 points. If these manipulators want 245 ish thennthey get 245 ish. No market here
Whoever that’s shorting this stock... Cramer’s comments have expired... kinda late on the short haha
unh drop 10% on idiot Bernie sanders --he cannot do #$%$ +++ he will never be elected --he is a idot
I wish I had sold off my UNH when it was at $265 a couple months ago. When it gets back up there I will. Same with my Fidelity healthcare provider mutual fund. Right now is not a good time to be in this sector. Better off with healthcare equipment and tech. It's a more consistent return in this political climate. I bought some IHI recently.
Congrats my long friends!!! Will hit $275.00 today lol

Lots of options activity folks..
Something brewing .....2 for 1?
Sitting out another rally. The fear the biz model will be extinguished is palpable.

"UNH ON SALE-Doubling down today, feel downside is far outweighed by upside at these prices. For what it is worth called Mad Money today and am trying to get Cramer's take. Don't know what his opinion will be, but producers seemed very interested in having Cramer opine about UNH on the Lightning Round."
Well I feel duped by wall street.
A clear winner!!!!
Why
"got to thank the democrats for this one, will never vote for them. TRUMP 2020"
down 6.66 sign of the Devil or BS
"WBA states the bad news is a good news for UNH. The Fed raises the price for medicare to over 5 % is a plus, what else you need."
Down again. I’m shocked lol. Seriously this stock is dead
Antitrust trade group comes out against UnitedHealth's planned Change Healthcare deal... not good at all!
This is where we showed support during the court hearings. One can only hope we still do.
what is going on? why is it sliding
The bottom is where the market makers say it is

"insiders purchased 26,975 shares during 01-MAY-2019-06-MAY-2019. we are ok....."
Nothing can crush a business like Washington DC.
"I took a look at Credit Suisse's research on Schwab's site. There is a ""blue sky"" scenario w/ a PT of $455 and there is this.Our Grey Sky Scenario (US$) 293.00Our grey sky valuation of $293 incorporates deterioration in MedicareAdvantage enrollment and margins and an increase in health careutilization, along with any regulatory changes that result in adverse effectson the PBM industry business model. This would imply UNH shares getvalued at a blended PT multiple of roughly 14x.IMO, fear of the latter is why the stock is languishing around $330. CS has a PT of $415 on the stock."
Buy buy buy. This is a gift. UNH will come back stronger then ever!
I am buying more at $245. This is insane. The weather is getting hot. Flu season (including coronavirus) will die soon. We will all be drinking Corona!!!
looks like next stop is 215 so will anyone by buying a5 215?
Happy hour to buy UNH now because UNH will beat the earnings again on Oct 16.
UnitedHealth is up 4.94% to 352.97
"What's going on today? I know state of Ohio is suing Optum for $16m, but there must be more to it to send down stock this much."
"I think we need some more negative headlines. Some more talk about single payer, another AG investigating over charges, the Trump admin going after the ACA again. Maybe the CEO getting accused of murder. Buyers are avoiding this like the plague."
UNH is a $500 stock in the next 12 months with a dividend increase from $5 to $6
It is time for Americans to take their country back from insurance companies. Companies that produce nothing. Go ahead and laugh at Bezos and Buffett. I am excited that finally people with real clout can start to run syndicates like UNH out of town.
A drop of over $30.00 this month!
Bottomed out. Let's go green! The Bernie distraction was just a moment joke.
Whoever can tell me why interest rate fear has anything to do with health care?
"My last entry point, in December was 245. Sold everything in February for 270.50. I was laughed at when I said sell the rally. There were two rallies and both reached the 270's. I recommended buying at 245 recently, but did not follow my own advice. Now holding out for the 238 target. Stay tuned."
One of my favorites. UNH to new highs based on valuation.
Up but massively underperforming hmo peers again. Anthem up 3.50Unh only up 1.80. In sorry but 1.80 in nothing when you lose 8.00 the day before and 28 the last week. Even 4.00 is nothing in that context
i guess it almost hit the bottom for UNH. I will buy it when it passes 220.
"If there are still bulls, try VIRT stock. You may make money. Current $20, in couple of months, it has potential for $30. Please note that this is just my opinion and invest wisely!"
"take what money you have gained , ,and donate to the AZ house and Senate ,, and bribe them to allow in this horrid state , the right to die with dignity"
Just bought more. $237.40. Thank you
Thank you for the info.
This stock is a slow running train wreck
"That was it, this is going back below $300."
Breakout on very strong volume is a great sign looking for much more gains ahead!!!
"After dropping a historic 10% in two days, does anyone really see another red day for Monday? Thumbs up for No, down for Yes."
I already muted Eric so I don't see any crazy posts.
keep in mind that nearly everybody fully recovers without medic al attention. the minority that get hit severely will not all be covered by UNH and this will be a reason to raise premiums. the average out of pocket deductible is between 10 and 20k before UNH spends any money. this is a money marker and the fear selling has brought a golden opportunity here at this level.
UNH is down 6.40% to 260.00
"CI, ANTM, HUM are participating. That's good."
David Windley of Jefferies seems to have missed on this one
Here it comes again. Same mfs pumpin & dumpin
UNH reported: Beats estimates...PLUS Strong forward forecast! A formidable combination leads to Plenty of room to run off from its all time highs.
Loaded all I could afford at the moment. Thank you for the sale of this no brainer stock.
As I was saying... $220 plus into close...
I said 260 260 260 . its going much higher. run shortie run
everyone take a look at cvs its starting to run too. 60 60 60
Even with the downgrade citi puts target price at 288 haha come on now...
Bloomberg is taking votes from both Sanders and Biden...The question is whether he takes more from Sanders or more from Biden?Buttigieg and Klobuchar need to get out...Warren can stay and share the progressive votes with Sanders...
I think this stock will be moving hire. Healthcare for all will not happens bc 70% of the people are happy with private via job... healthcare for all is a dumb idea and the Americana hard working people will not tolerate it.
This stock is headed to $300
Finally.............there's a bid under healthcare.
"By the way, Death Cross has occurred to UNH in mid Feb, and the 50-day moving average line is trending down."
"Don't count on Biden in the WH yet.With the latest scandal, people who support #MeToo willhave no choice but not voting for Biden.If Trump can't limit shoot-in-the-foot incidents himself...he may remain in WH"
Who is selling this stock based on the current problems with the market????! Too many stupid fund managers in this stock that sell this when they lose on more economic sensitive stocks. I his market had good fund managers they would be flocking to this stock and selling their industrials and tech. No reason whatsoever this stock is down 3.50!amd the nasdaq is positive. No reason and it’s a big mispricing
its funny with median age rising health care will boom this whole story is a nothing burger Co. etc provide incentives for healthier employees for years lol

"Bring it down, I will not sell you cons! It goes back to 270 in no time, they are buying at these low prices."
Just the thought of Socialist Democrats getting control cause these healthcare stocks to tank!
This dog just won’t hunt. Bet it goes red soon. Until it have a down 15 day with a sharp reversal then lower this goes
UNH should have well above $240 if some money managers are little aggressive like BA's investors did.UNH fundamentals are better than BA actually.
"Added at $210. If gets under that again, I will keep adding. Sell off has gone too far imo. Time to appreciate the overreaction and panic and start accumulating."
"Raised full year guidance and Bernie said it himself, ""The bill has little chance of passing with a Republican majority in Congress, as Sanders has conceded."" lol"
What happens if Democrats take the house?
"Here's something to read from another Democrat on Medicare for all. ""When they say Medicare for All, people have to understand this: Medicare for All is not as good a benefit as the Affordable Care Act. It doesn't have catastrophic [coverage] - you have to go buy it. It doesn't have dental. It's not as good as the plans that you can buy under the Affordable Care Act. So I say to them, come in with your ideas, but understand that we're either gonna have to improve Medicare - for all, including seniors - or else people are not gonna get what they think they're gonna get. And by the way, how's it gonna be paid for?Now, single-payer is a different thing. People use the terms interchangeably. Sometimes it could be the same thing, but it's not always. Single-payer is just about who pays. It's not about what the benefits are. That is, administratively, the simplest thing to do, but to convert to it? Thirty trillion dollars [over 10 years]. Now, how do you pay for that?So I said, 'Look, just put them all on the table, and let's have the discussion, and let people see what it is. But know what it is that you're talking about."" All I want is the goal of every American having access to health care. You don't get there by dismantling the Affordable Care Act. As Californians have said to me, ""We get billions and billions of dollars out of the Affordable Care Act coming into California. Now they want to get rid of that.' How are they gonna go to single-payer in California without the money from the Affordable Care Act?"""
Who ever this constant manipulator or seller is he is to much to beat. It’s clear the stock won’t move until that person or entity allows it to
minus 10 now???
The stock manipulation scam continues here day after day and week after week
"Time to buy, insurance companies control both the health industry and congress. Buy Buy Buy"
if you sell here you are a loser
UNH is up 4.95% to 294.75
Junk
This is just embarrassing! Did the moron CEO shoot his big mouth off again?
Warren & sanders are definite out on first round
Once the market reverses today this stock will be 235
UNH has reached another 52-week Low...
Just pulled the trigger for 100 at 250
You guys didnt see this game last week? This will be up past $220 into close.
Our message to Steve Nelson and UnitedHealthcare is simple: When we are in the White House your greed is going to end. We will end the disgrace of millions of people being denied health care while a single company earns $226 billion and its CEO makes $7.5 million in compensation.
Good old Uncle Bernie...
We’re going back up!
Two days in a row that UNH price moves lowest in term of percentage among Health Care providers. It will explode on July 17. I thought UNH should hit new high this week and BREAK OUT.
Senator McCain just put a bullet in the repeal of the current ACA. UNH stock jumped up as a result mid-day today.
Buy when everyone is selling.This is such a great company
This POS dog won’t hunt. Cigna up 4.30 and up 2.20 on Friday. That’s 5 percent while unh is up .5 percent lol. This stock is awful. It’s in the Dow and I see hat as the problem this stock is too manipulated. Humana up 4.20 also. This stock is absolutely pointless to own. Whynown a stock that refuses to ever go up. There is a virtual brick wall at 331.00 has been now for almost a week
Why this is going down
Then why are we so low when everything goes down and barely up when everything recovers?
Just curious how many on here would take a Medicare for allPlan and what’s your age?
UNH is down 4.92% to 210.08
COME GO DOWN MORE
"From Credit Suisse on UNH's exposure to the moron's ruling. 'Specifically, we estimate HIX and Medicaidexpansion together are likely contributing close to 32% of earnings forCNC, 3-4% of annual EPS for ANTM, less than 2% for CI (pre-ESRXmerger), and less than 1% for UNH.""As we know UNH does not participate in the ACA exchange market so once again their exposure is next to nothing. So, while the EPS multiple will naturally come down along with the rest of the market UNH's earnings are not under pressure."
I have been against Medicare for All but after 6 weeks of dealing with UNH I think we need Medicare For All and we need to eliminate this company and all insurers like it. They tripled my wife's premium because they found a prescription for aspirin from 3 years ago related to a knee surgery and concluded she had a heart condition. Sux weeks and at least 30 phone calls later and after wasting hundreds of hours on the phone with them they still will not change their position--even with a letter from the prescribing doctor saying the aspirin was prescribed for pain and not for a heart condition. It is pure torture to deal with this company and they deserve to be put out of business.
"looking good, inching up to match its numbers...earnings steady, PE low, dividend solid, etc... no reason not to breach $250 w/i a month, 260+ end of year..."
Management should be screaming
"will never, never vote democrat"
This stock is going over $300 in the short term even with the market in disarray. They are a corporate juggernaut. In some ways they are the perfect company in that they are so diversified in terms of business and operational risk. Short of socialistic healthcare not sure what will allow them down.
We are sitting 4% below the 52 week (All time) high Medicare for all Political rhetoric seems to be on hold for the time being The Investor’s day conference is 12 days out if the 2020 projections look good I think that we have a good chance of moving higher And maybe setting new All time highs before the end of the year
"Bernie is not going to win , if the democratic/socialist/communist party nominates him. He nor any of those idiots running on the democratic ticket can beat Trump, anyway. All they do is bicker and the few who bring up policies and aren't acting like a gossip magazine have policies that make no sense and they have no clue how they are implemented. Bernie the big Capitalist wants all of the rest of us to live under his socialist policies and he somehow thinks that it is better and ok to make money from writing a book than other enterprising endeavors. What a disgusting display of evil we will see when we watch the Democratic debates. Thank God for Trump and the really good news is with the Horowitz report and other investigations being instigated by Barr, quiet a few of those crooks , liars, and ignoble people in the justice dept may be going to the crow bar hotel."
Upgrades are coming soon.
UNH has got to be a buy prior to the quarterly earnings report. The fall off in the stock is an over reaction as Medicare For All won't happen now if ever. Expect the ACA and related options to be modified in the future but not eliminated. Their PBM unit could come under additional presure but the balance of UNH's units should do fine.
Great time to add.
Medicare for all is killing UNH. It won't happen but the buzz right now is on it as an idea. You will never get it through the government tangle.
$UNH Maintains SVB Leerink Outperform USD 373 » USD 378 Target Raised by Stephens & Co. Overweight USD 355 » USD 380 Target Raised by Cantor Fitzgerald Overweight USD 360 » USD 375
I just keep buying the no brainer stock. UNH is so undervalue right now.
"Feels like momo hedge funds dumping UNH and buying DIS breakout above 120. I am not selling a single share of mine on this fear mongering wall street FUD. A year from now, this will likely be a blip."
"All these Health Insurers are rip offs to the society! All must be bankrupt and Govt must run a health care system with a cap on Doctors' fee, Medicine cost etc. that is affordable to the society and whoever wants to be insured can participate. Also, the increase of the cost must match with the inflation. (Similarly, the college tuition too). These 2 areas otherwise will make US folks bankrupt soon!"
Pos doesn’t even trade or move anymore except down. It’s obvious this is being wash traded all day long by the specialist. It won’t move. If it can’t move up then beat it moves down and then it can get bettter shareholders
UNH is up 4.91% to 268.40
"Any ideas on the 2% drop yesterday, 10/17? It wasn't the sector, and I could find no news to explain the move. Was it simply profit taking by institutions, after the big jump the day before? I'm just curious, trying to get a feel for what drives these moves."
Unh headquarters in more or less a communist taliban state of Minnesota. I’m only in unh for technical rebound but it obvious this stock is hated and won’t see all time highs again
If you sell today you miss the dividend! Sept. 13 is ex-dividend date. If you buy tomorrow you miss it.
"I don't think the market makers can hold UNH down any more, look at the move. you can see the volume with the price rise."
Last time I looked at this stock during the financial crisis it was 30$ a share.
"Tried to tell people to be the first one to the exit door and not stick around. All those media goofs pushed HC as undervalued, nothing but cons. This is about to get worse over the next six months, and you had plenty of time to find the door...."
"Now you know that why the market makers did pull UNH down from 259 to 250. Because they want to get UNH at the cheapest price as possible. If UNH can draw the attention and go back up to 260 by the end of the month, you will see UNH explode up to 270s really easy when UNH reports the earnings by mid April."
just bought another hundred shares at 240... nothing like keeping some powder dry I guess.
I think the liberals need to introduce mandated housing next. The government will build all the houses and everyone shall have a right to housing. You don't need to pay a dime to get a house. Could home builders be the next target?
awesome day. keep the rewards....selling into strength for a trade on my calls. stock holding on till q4.......with these swings its a traders dream....good luck to all
"If one day the US does turn to a government run healthcare system,what happens to UHN?"
"I assume WS is pricing in a DEM victory in November? Hide the women and children, gonna get ugly! $HUM $CI $CVS"
Its all about going after Optum... OptumRx . Rx via Amazon. Don't Scoff.
Larry for President.
Love this stock but wide open gap down there at 152.85 to 155.18 might try and fill it not sure ?
"This too, shall pass. Sooner than you think."
"can someone tell me why this stock is not getting hammered from all the negative sentiment around it ? Sanders doing so well in the poles, corona virus costing them a fortune."
"hoping this stock gets hurt in run up to election so I can buy in at a bargain, it is already a buy at this price but I'm being greedy"
I can not believe this is happeing with UNH (http://Experttrade.uno)
"I sold my call before close, this is bad."
Won't the healthcare system continue to need claim administration and processing in any case?
$250 after ER and $260 by end of May
unh is recovering from lows of the day....from 212 to 214 even though overall market is falling
"Hey......let's do some MATH. I have read no less than a dozen articles that say retirees will need to put away $200K-$250K to cover your healthcare cost in your retirement years. So I am going to assume that with the Medicare for all plan, a retire with ""no formal earnings from employment"", will qualify for FREE health care (of course paid for by someone else's taxes). So now I'm saving $200-$250K. IF Medicare for all happens. So I think I'll buy 300 shares of UNH at this price.........so when FREE healthcare doesn't happen, I can still grin at the irony. Either way I win and so do you if your circumstances are similar to mine. Bring it on!!"
I added at $192.50. It may go down a bit more but you rarely get a opportunity to add to this name.
Surprising me when UNH dropped hard over 6 points yesterday. I can not figure it out at all. I guess it should going up yesterday. But today I think UNH can stop bleeding because it has no weak point at all at this moment.
"Bunch of wussies when sanders name come up. Pleassse! That guy is in the race for only distractions & disruptions. 100% he will not win. & he knows it too, that’s the sad part"
Hold on to your shares. Don't let shorts steal them cheap. Make them suffer.
Im in at 218! lets go!

Yesterday UNH hit a major support level. Down over $12 creates value and oversold.
This stock has a lot of potential and could easily elevate in upward direction
"...the ""No-Bernie"" bounce."
I would stay away form this company. Their drug company is in a horrible situation of not getting drugs timely to patients. Major delays causing health issues. Delays seem to be red tape to save money v health care. Second it outsourcing to India to deal with your health and privacy. Law suits are on the way it looks like.
here we go
Probably selling because of the DOJ investigation.
"Lots of midgets @ that place Ben G, Paul E"
Obama is so implicated on spying on the Trump campaign that he will wear the orange suit so well
Can't stand it gotta buy a little
"Buy before earning...after earning, this will be in 300 range..."
Is this junk a high tech?
"Anyone else pulling the trigger on any of the big Ins companies? UNH, AET, ANT, CNC, MOH, HUM?This is the worst flu season in over 2 decades...just tossing that out there. MLR for all these will get hammered Q4 and/or Q1."
"I just stick with my UNH and CI because it is undervalued, PE around 14, dividends and have both growth in earnings and revenue."
If I didn't know better I'd say this looks like a good buy.

"You know it's a bad day when you think.........oh good, now it's only down 4.5%."
TRUMP'S drug price policy will clearly benefit UNH/ UNH will blow away the estimated number on Jan 17. I JUST BELIEVE IN IT.
"The market makers take a lot of panic up to the hill and drop them dry on the top. I have confidence that UNH is not gonna going down in this slow down economy. It is the best defensive stock in the Dow 30 at this moment. People forget that UNH is one of the best Dow for the last 10 years. It came from $ 23-24 in 2011-2012. Look at the history of this stock, the investors got to trust it for more or less, otherwise, it will not stand tall till now."
"Stock is in free fall. I don’t think it would be up if Dow was up 600 points. Oh wait, on Friday and Monday the Dow was up 600 points and this stock wasn’t up lol. This stock is a nightmare and the management is asleep at the wheel. Where is their big share buy back? Management must be selling too"
Change unh ticker to ugh
Keep unh shares. I acquired in 2001 as ee. Quarterly dividend checks have gone up 110%. High of 305.31 just before pandemic on 2/19/20 and high on Friday was 300.99 4/17/20. Don't panic. Unh is bouncing back quickly and will do just fine even if there is another market disaster.
I expect will finish green today.
it was down over 9 so I put in buy
"No brainer stock, UNH will blow earnings estimate away by Oct 16."
tech breakout... gap fill to 235 pre earnings?
unh down $5 yesterday with market down a bit and cnc down a lot. Unh even today with market up a lot and cnc up a lot........
Total junk. Not one buyer here. The volume is just indexing. StockIs down another 1.00 in a good tape. See you at 215
"I know we're up 3% at the close, but this feels like a defeat to close below 300, going into earnings. Some big player will NOT let this run past 300. Are they ever going to run out of stock to sell? I was hoping the 7th try at 300 was the one..."
Topping here. You don’t make money on a stock until you sell and cash out

"this is cursed, or maybe i am. BRUTAL..."
UNH should buy Fitbit.
lol this is the most pathetic stock I have ever seen. It is a money pit
Shake out weak hands before a huge move up. Expect to close > 245 by EOW if this is the case.
"If these things don’t change Gross revenue growing 10%+/year Earnings per share growing 15%+/yr Dividend rising 20%/year l Big share buy backs Big free cash flow Strategic bolt on acquisitions Deep management bench... then, The only thing that keeps me awake at night is the left 20% of the dem party calling for the US to become a socialist country.. If they (the socialists) succeed in destroying the country’s capitalist nature the price of UNH won’t matter because anybody whose not a member of the bureaucracy will be standing in line waiting for bread I’m betting that we aren’t about to become Venezuela.. If Trump wins re-election UNH will eventually, not today, not this year but eventually, become a $400/share company.. if Warren or Bernie win the Dem nomination Unh could drop >50% before the dust settles."

"Hello boys, remember me saying when institution upgrade a stock to buy,on July 19th 2019 2 institutions while UNH trading at $260.00 the boys on wall street upgraded the stock to a buy, but as you can see were UNH is trading right now, never fails happens all the time and we call these people financial adviser , go figure"
I can't watch this anymore :(
Lol look at this pos stock
Q3 earnings projections $3.30 per share. Come on Cramer.
Very very likely Unh + wba= Cvs + aet
"imagine what happens when markets continue upward climb. 250 is a lock, and nuther 20 points up in a new york minute.. sorry shorty."
"it is strange ALL CI,HUM and UNH down quite substantially. What is the news?"
bull trap
This stock is pointless
"If you buy this, Bernie can't handout free boobjobs and hair replacement for everyone. Instead invest in Bernie, he carries a P/E of ZERO."
UNH is no joke folks haha
All analysts have a buy or outperform rating on UNH. That’s all I need to know. Long and strong baby!
Naked short sale Goldman Sachs
Pretty day today. Great days ahead. $600 is not a dream.

"At this point, candidate Bloomberg would hurt Trump more than Bernie.Democrats will make a huge mistake with Bernie."

I'm a buyer at 245.

There's the V reversal traders were looking for.
UNH getting torched!!!
Killing mutual funds too that have UNH as a top tier holding.
before the bell or after for earnings tmr?
This is going to pop. Wait for it
TRUMP GOING AFTER UNH.. WSJ
Who bought UNH at 250+ this week? Sucks to be you!
"Commonsense and logic thinking, don't be misled by the lawsuit. I saw a lot of lawsuit which end up nothing happen. If UNH is guilty, so do the whole industry because they use the same code. Understand ?"
Look at a 6 month chart with the 50 dma. It almost always checks back to the 50 dma after a run. Fundamentals are intact. Back to $268-270 before the next report.
UNH reached a 52 Week low at 205.94
someone's loading weekly calls betting on big bounce.
"Picked up some 260 calls for 4/18 at the close on Friday. Unless the markets completely crash next week, This thing should hit 260 by Friday. If it hits 270 before earnings I’m selling my calls just in case"
UNH is down 4.95% to 259.59
Congratulations longs. It was a brutal couple of years but now we are rolling. Time for me to stop worrying about this stock and head on over to #UNH to figure out how I can salvage that one.
"Now now, this is no way to reward Bernie. Without him there won't be free boobjobs and hair replacement for all."

"So much for Medicare for all look Humana flying. It’s all bs, never affected them"
They run up the number and then let go. The market makers have so many tricks. I still believe that UNH is still the best one in health care sector.
Head and shoulders pattern that started forming 12/24 is nearly completed.
You can stock a fork in this pos she is done. D-O-N-E. Done. Done. Relentless selling here every single day for weeks and weeks at a time. Management is MIA. They promised a share buyback but they aren’t buying shares that’s obvious . So why announce a share vBuyback if you aren’t going to do it
Dipping my toes at 238. Will we hit it today?
300 by end of year..
"RSI at 30,this is crazy"
The bottom is getting ready to fall out of this stock. There are no buyers no matter how far Dow they take this stock. It could do anything and be up tomorrow but that just not the probability because this price action is horrific: I have a fairly large call position but I had to leave a lot of cash and powder because this stock may go to 230 or lower very very soon. I mean if it can fall from 270 to 241 and there are no buyers coming in then why can’t it go down another 10-20. It can. I think this sell off is crazy but for some reason it the stock has no buyers even on up 300 days on Dow. That is just not a good stock
How many days in a row now? Time for some C suiters to get canned.

Execs with United and other managed care/insurance companies make $5mil to $30mil a year. One year the head of an Illinois company took home $100 million. They say doctors make too much money. Blue Cross of Florida pays me the EXACT same amount at the end of my professional career than they did 38 years ago at the beginning. NOT adjusted for inflation. Corporate America is often run by greed with no moral compass. When will the revolution happen? When will execs stop exploiting families by gutting hospital staffs and claiming they offer great medical care? They make hospitals worse places to work and patient care suffers because of their greed.
nice move at $208.25

Bernie sandbags and democrats just want to win the white house but this will never happen. Medicare for all will bankrupt USA!
back to 298 today...squeeze them shorts
This thing is a complete pile of trash. I wished my Mutual Fund would dump this loser. Always down.
I wouldn't be shocked too see unh back @ 250 today. UNH is on sale. Its a cash machine
Going lower still. No buyers nkt even at 215. Look at the volume. Basically nothing
$220 today anyone?
Cramer has a price target of unh at 320
"Joe Biden launched the attack his aides had previewed all day early in the debate Friday, criticizing the cost and political feasibility of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” proposal. Biden said Sanders, who famously said he “wrote the damn bill,” now won’t say “what the damn thing’s gonna cost.” “How much is it going to cost? Who’s going to pay for it? It’ll cost more than the entire federal budget we spend now — more than the entire budget,” Biden said. He also said Sanders' plan could never clear the Senate..."
sad
I really hope that spamming twit SF shorted the hell out of this.
Market flirts with record highs and UNH goes down. I am so unimpressed with this stock's performance it bothers me to the core. And the Corp is doing so well!
after hrs showed minus 8 for 10 min what hPpened
"Last time I checked, UNH does not have any business in Iran nor Iraq...It has business in Brazil..."

"Aw, what happened, did UNH crush earnings again? Can someone please check for me? Ever since this stock made me financially independent I am too fat and lazy to do things for myself, thanks!"
"What gets me is this. Even if Medicare-for-all fulfilled the 5% chance it has at becoming law in the next 5 years... These sellers don't think the best company in the sector, with huge diversification, won't be able to pivot and work with the government contracts? It is the smaller healthcare companies that would suffer. Notice how the Defense sector is dominated by a few big contractors."
Unbelievable drop. I'm buying.

Thanks for the pop Larry
Lol
I feel the drop is just robots selling everything... or investors selling UNH to cover their losses in those overvalued stocks... just a good buying opportunity... earnings show that there’s no reason for this stock to not go up

"Jeffries had a deal with shorting - went on a slashing spree - hope they gave out that list of who they were slashing to the right folks to prosper. Thanks Jeffries! Seriously - what's the basis of the UNH slash. And a few others around the market?Deal with China coming, jobless numbers are hot, housing numbers hot, etc.. ? what up"
At $300 UNH is a 20 PE. When people sell you have to avoid until the dust clears. Bottom could be $210 or less.
Didn't expect this! OUCH
Medicare for all will not happen! Could they reduce the age to be Medicare eligible...yes. This would be more business for UNH!
no reason but rumors UNH is just fine. A CASH MACHINE
seems oversold
Hello biggest holding!
Get ready...here comes $400 tomorrow!!!
Still looks cheap unbelievably
Overbought!
Should be going up to 400 soon
Weak hand just dump and be gone already
"After the recent bloodbath, I thought I was doing good adding at $219 this morning! Should have known better!"
"What to expect after today CC at noon, will there be any statements to drive the stock higher? Looking for a jump once the decent results from report and any comments from execs are digested to $315, and a gradual move to $330."
Who is it that is selling this stock relentlessly for weeks? They continue to sit on the ask and not allow it to move. Why are they manipulating this stock so aggressively and obvious to anyone watching.
Sell the rally.
"It is time to buy UNH, because it will blow out the earnings estimate again. Earnings growth over 20% with dividends. One of Dow 30 which still not disappoint the investors more than 10 years. I bought it since it is 23-24 in 2011-2012"
way oversold here.....UNH has a 1% exposure to the ruling to overturn obamacare......which will be certainly be reversed on appeal.
Should start the earning ride this week...
UNH is on Sales again. The market is down trend today but I believe UNH at this price should have the support a lot from the investors. The earnings in April will prove that UNH is the REAL DEAL.
Geez....didn't go down as much as the general market because Bernie got 2 stents put in. Just think what would happen if Pocahontas got Indian fever.
"Money still pours in health care sector. HUM, ANTM, AET all are green except UNH. I think UNH will go green today by the closed time."

UNH is set to beat estimates by a penny. I don't worry about today's performance.
This is the stock to buy and hold it for your retirement.
UNH robbed people ... time to act

Way way way oversold. Purchased some June $250 calls. Easy $$$
risky so xlf add banks for the div
"no news, what happened to the stock today?"
No wonder hedge funds cannot beat an index ETF. Who in his right mind would sell UNH at these prices based on a soon to RIP Bernie?
"is it a surprise the fed picked super tuesday to show strength? how else to show the necessity to dump bernie....if bernie shows any viability this market, this economy, and this country tanks.... this fed will support capitalism and dominant economy....by all means."
I am disappointed to see the stock down about 7% from the post earnings bump to $360 following the reiteration of guidance and analyst price target raises. I suspect two possible culprits. 1. Fear over a resurgent virus if the mutant(s) strain takes hold. 2. Fear of a proposal by Biden that will negatively effect the biz model.
Stock was under 30 a decade ago. Anyone think Americans are getting shafted?
Should stop the market till the end of virus...
"UNH is a great stock and I have held it a long time and have enjoyed great results with it. Like many of you I have dramatically reduced my position to a token amount due to the political situation. I agree with others on here that Elizabeth Warren is not electable next year but I also believe the US healthcare system is corrupt, is not effectively serving the best interests of the American public and in desperate need of large scale changes/reforms. I am also concerned that these recent actions to impeach Trump will place some serious shade on Joe Biden. If that happens, Pocahontas could very well be the Democrats candidate next fall. If that happens, look out below for UNH and the rest of the healtcare industry stocks at least until the Dems are slaughtered in the 2020 elections."
From down in nonstop fashion from 270 to 212 to up from 212 to 278 without a single pullback.That’s not a natural organic stock trading but a calculated manipulated stock move. It was hated at 220 and loved at 270. Strange
Will the socialists blow up our momentum tonight? I’m sure they will all be trying to out do each other

Long term buy all the way to the bank. It is very hard to get the stock at discount like today.
"If it hits 214, it's gonna slide bad."
"what Trump doesn't destroy, the Democrats are sure to destroy themselves ; Invest in healthcare ? Good luck."
Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) 14.78-1.91 (-11.41%)As of 2:36PM EDT. Market open.
"It is no-brainer to buy UNH last Friday. Compare UNH and ANTM. size, P/E growth rate, dividends and history. Lawsuit will take years and end up nothing because every thing goes by code, it is standard process which every health care does it. Whoever lets go the stock on Friday is idiot. Think commonsense and logic, don't let the scrum bags mislead you that lawsuit is big deal."
"Maybe it's a good stock but UNH is an awful company. The customer service is abysmal. My wife applied for insurance and they sent her a letter saying they got a report from some Milliscripts company that said she had a heart condition and so they are jacking up her rates. The insane thing is that my wife does not have a heart condition but UNH will not say how of why they concluded she did. There is an appeal process but she needs to send them 2 years of medical records and a bunch of other things---which will be time consuming and expensive. The fact that UNH won't identify what evidence they came up with regarding this imagined heart condition is disgusting. Maybe we do need Medicare for All so we get rid of companies like UNH that torture their ""customers""."
Fighting back to green at close
"i will conceed eric was right about unh dipping more and more and more..selling yeaterday my holdings!!saying that, i still wonder if buying somewhere near the lows will be smart???"
"Is everyone forgetting that the major cost of healthcare is the hospitals and doctors, NOT the insurance company?"
AMZN BRK JPM have proven they can't shake health care insurance yet...Go UNH!!!
When you compare UNH #6 fortune company $243 to CVS Aetna #8 fortune company $65.70 I believe Aetna CVS is a better buy long term. Both have good dividends.
Don't miss the opportunity to buy UNH today. The earnings will beat the estimate again.UNH already raises the earnings guide line and raise the dividends.It is no-brainer stock.
I told you so...https://www.marketwatch.com/story/unitedhealth-surges-toward-record-as-bernie-sanders-nh-win-seen-bolstering-trumps-re-election-chances-2020-02-12?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
slow day. LOL
Numbers look great year over year. Im buying. Looks like a sale to me.
Options show a finish +/- at $250
"not bad, not bad at all"
Just buy the damn no brainer stock and forget it for 2 years. I guarantee you that It will be higher than 300. The Dow will be new high again as soon as BA can fix the software problem and start to build 737 Max. It will take a few more month. US can not keeps BA on the sideline for more than 3 months because it will screw GDP. It is all economic stupid.
"Other than stealing money from hard working Americans, What the EFF does an insurance company do?"
Order filled at $256.50
"All market index DOW, S&P, NASDAW had a Golden Cross in April, UNH had a Death Cross in late Fed and 50-day moving average is trending down, this does not look good. If UNH is going down while market is booming at all time high, imagine what will happen to UNH when market has a pull back or a correction which could happen soon. UNH will probably drop to $180, that's a 25% drop from today's opening price."
Humana up 5.00. Not Unh
Just curious: Won’t corona claims dry all profits?
Understandable that there are concerns but this looks like a major sale on a very strong company. Does America really want Washington bureaucrats deciding if we're eligible for surgery?
It’s going back up; always so interesting to follow this stock
why down how does Cigna affect
The WORK is under way for UNH. It looks like YO-YO today. I bought call 270 early when CI went up like a rocket.
glitch?again
"Instead of 275+, now I see 280 first thing in the morning, I BELIEVE."
Why no new Ex-Div date posted yet? Does UNH tend to announce this much loser to the date than further ahead of time?
This stock is garbage. No buyers at any level. All breakout are false and quickly sold. The stock is complete junk and if it ever get to 236 again sell it
"I had bought UNH as a best in class buy and hold stock. Should I stick with the plan or take my losses and leave? thumbs up stay, thumbs down leave"
"Selloff overdone. Medicare for all suffers from the Moviepass effect - it's great until people paying for everything run out of patience and money. Meanwhile, UNH mgmt will continue to execute."
support may be at 251-ish
"oh come on UNH, get in the green."
Medicare for All is a pipe dream. The medicare system is already on the verge of running out of money by 2026. How is medicare for all realistic? UNH is a strong buy now. All the way back to 250 next week.
"very predictable, up in the morning and red at close. sad"
"It will not be long for the tide to turn around, because after looking all Dow 30, UNH is the cheapest and a lot less risky than AAPL or BA."
HAHAHHAHAHA AHA I GET MY NEW CAR HELL YEAH HELL YEAH
20 times worse than other PBMS
Why is it dropping?
It appears to have broken above the 50 dma as their next quarterly report approaches. Unless there is more news from AMZN-JPM-Berkshire on the health insurance front and Drumpf doesn't crush the market with more idiocy it could run back up to $245-250 in a few months.
Wow this thing is truly bottomless. 220 isna sure thing
Healthcare stocks do better on average from May through September. Why the big drop today? Did universal coverage hearing today cause this 6 point drop???
UNH at the current price is a bargain. Very good value. Div. Growth. I bought near the close on Friday. Happy to be in it again.
Let’s not all get too giddy. UNH is back to 300 but is it all UNH or isn’t most stocks at highs? It took 125 sp500 points and unh just broke above where it was 3 weeks ago.Sure if SP 500 goes up another 100-200 points this will see 310-320. If SP500 loses 100 points this is back to 285
Anthem up 6.50. Cigna up 3.5 percent . UNH has become the dog
"Centrist, just change insurers ..... 100 hours on the phone ???"
"""I bought this stock at low price blah blah blah and now im retiring hip hip hurray."" Lmao good job bots"
See you people thought I was just being negative but I had good reason to be negative as you now see. Kinda sucks for you people to hold a stock for 2 years and it’s down
can someone help me explain why this stock is down since yesterday???
Health stocks are way ahead expensive... too risky now

If the Trump/Republicans had tried to make ACA better to work for all no one would see these drops. The Dems would not be able to make a big issue. I think it’s the arrogant right wing idea not to let any Obama policy to succeed. Wasted so much time fighting it.
The Bottom LineUnitedHealth stock looks ready to clear 2018 resistance in an uptrend that could eventually reach $500.
Need good number tomorrow because the market tends to bail out.
The low into the single digits held it back at the close. Good consolidation around $217. Likely to break through tomorrow.
Feel the Bern as they say
Wait for 260...
"Boeing: Something Has To Give https://seekingalpha.com/article/4242154?source=ansh $BA, $DIA, $UNH, $V"
Fireworks tomorrow morning for UNH.
Everyone should like free health care. No one has to pay. And it only costs the government $43 trillion over 10 years. It's free. Only those rich evil taxpayers have to pay anything. Tax those evil taxpayers at a 101% rate and no one has to work and pay for health insurance.
Can’t wait for karma to catch up to united healthcare. Hiking premiums then denying procedures and drugs people need. How anyone can support that is beyond me. Soon the chickens will come home to roost
The depressed stock price is all about FOW...........Fear of Warren.
A beat and raise and it looks like it will hit a week low.
$235-240 after earnings on Tuesday morning
Are we going back to $230 next month?
"I don’t want the government touching health care anymore, I think the dems have ruined it for the rest of us. Don’t enjoy paying those Premiums... do you?"
this is trash
The MOST Favorable Outcome of ACA / Obama-care is best explained this way. When the ACA was enacted / incorporated March 2010 UNH was trading at $30/share. Today $330!!! - Cui Bono? Usual Suspects as usual.
"It is too early or what. I am out of UNH early yesterday and come back again, because i think UNH can do much better this quarter."
I'm a buyer at 222. No sooner.
Looks like a great quarter to me
This dog won’t hunt
Once a stock becomes this broken technically it become a feedback loop and builds on itself. UNH is heading much much lower because as you can see even down from 265 there are no buyers for this stock: even management won’t do the share buyback they promised. This management team is stupid
Love UNH
Load up and it is ready to rocket to the sky
If this is due to Cramer...then these sellers are too dumb to own UNH
All this because Jerome Powell is a stubborn fool that has allowed a 49 year bond to trade lower than the feds fund rates. Why the coward trump doesn’t move to remove Powell an sthe entire fed board shows what a fool trump is also
This roller coaster is making me dizzy
Before Obamacare my UHC high deductible plan was $250 a month. It just increased another 20% this year to $953. I am very conservative but I want a single payer system for one simple reason. To put UNH out of business. Cut out the middle man and let groups of doctors and hospitals contract directly with the federal government. It can't be any worse than what we have now.
Cigna up 10.40 since Thursday’s close lol. Unh would have to gain 16.00 just to catch up. This stock is a chump stock. Worst of breed
MFA... At least that's what Bloomberg is saying. UNH is their stock of the hour.
The stock is so high for no reasons!! It's almost like the bitcoin bubble!
This is going to 240. Coronavirus I factions are going to skyrocket in the US and we have an incompetent president.
What a bull!
What a great stock. No matter where you buy it you know it’s going up. Seize the opportunity
"This is looking more and more like a buying opportunity. Do you really think that an exec unloading 50,000 shares is cause for panic?"
"not surprised at all. grabbing this in the 220s was a guaranteed safe bet, and if you already owned it in the red, a guaranteed 100% recovery. never ever sell this stock in the red. ever."
Down almost 4% in the past 5 days. Humana was down over 6% in the same period. Hold on for more.
Stupid me. It looked like it might hold on to the gains today. Nope. Selling is relentless.
"It is time to step in, it is no brainer stock and all the peers are OK today."
"disappointing, as long as there's Amazon there will always be possible bad news"
"Are investors that frightened of the Medicare for All rhetoric out of the Democratic camp? They must be, can't really explain it any other way. I know people are adding now, but if it is Medicare-for-All that's scaring people, we could see a lot more of this until Bernie inevitably drops out of the race. Which is why I'm so confused in the first place, Bernie has no shot. Why are investors still hesitant?"
"Eric you are a loser, unh is a great bargain at this price, if you had any stones at all you would realize it and buy, but you obviously only want to trash this stock, bet you have zero in the markets, just bored with your pathetic life"
target @140 ... at most - policy dependent
"so, the geniuses in Congress acknowledge 1 million lost jobs from Medicare for all. the plan sets aside some money for these people to ""transition""...when the growth engine of jobs for the last 10 years grinds to a halt, what do these dipshits think will happen to the economy???"
No way this is worth it.
Low volume...people may be on vacation already...
time to pull out
Give us a green day
"The DOW roars 235 points & UNH collapse's 6%. Something is terribly wrong here. Stop all the ""buy the dip"" #$%$. Run hard & run fast. Whatever the really news is has leaked & us bagholdsers won't find out until the earnings release at which point UNH will promptly drop below $200. Don't shoot the messenger"
The after hours movement shows how ridiculously oversold this was today.
"Time to get out from this market soon. Sooner you get out, the better that you won’t be involved in the crash"
Wow $10 swing at the open. This thing isn’t done going down.
UNH forget to tip the market maker today?
Good entry point here

"Eric is a meathead who goes to the various boards where the stock is down and then he bashes the stock. He's neither long or, short anything. He's mental."
The only sector that will perform worse this year than the HC sector is the energy sector
any guess of why there's been a significant insider selling over the past 3 months? I don't like seeing the chairman and a Lead director selling this much so close to the Q4 financials results scheduled for early this next Jan.

anyone here trading $UNH?
Here comes the fade into the close. Time to buy!
Money in the bank.
Don't let the shorts con you out of your shares. UNH is a money machine.
Kamala Harris will ultimately choose not to have single payer Medicare for all.... Its very evident!!
"As you can see, the new mandate on lowering drug prices, is really going to boost the price of this stock!"
Dropping non stop. At this rate it can go down 20 pts unreal!!!
Super Tuesday voters have spoken. Destruction of our capital markets and the prosperity they generate is not in our future.
"It is disaster for the Longs. It is unbelievable, the market makers just pull the rabbit out of the hat again. There are so many call at 265,270. They just clean them up."
Quotes are still crazy... Just saw this: 219.87+1.37 (+0.63%) At close: 3:59PM EDT 229.48 0.00 (0.00%) After hours: 4:56PM EDT
What was that?
This seller never stops
"The healthcare market segment has been beaten down to be the worst performer in 2019. Doesn't matter what part of healthcare you look at. For example, equipment manufacturers have taken the same hit as insurance companies. This just tells you that what is happening is not going to continue for healthcare companies in general. Companies who make and sell healthcare equipment and disposables will not be hit by a possible change in the insurance market. Demand for health services and the related need for equipment continues to grow in the US as an aging population and growing population increase the need. So, I am going to hold onto UNH and my other healthcare stocks as the current depressed situation will too pass."
bought more for Christmas
Feeling the Bern yet?
word must be getting out on earnings already.
"I hope some are selling the top, you will wish you did. Find the exit while you can..."
"The market is general is over-extended, while not directly related to investments in CV, pull up the charts from the S&P and catch this panic sell off. $AAPL, $FB, $SPY, $UNH, $NVDA. The correction is happening. There is nothing “evil” about shorting a falling market. Money is literally falling like rain. Use $SPY as your barometer and bank some puts or equities short swings to grow your account. Look at any of these I mentioned and see for yourself before commenting something stupid . I made out great shorting $UNH and $AAPL this week. Just a friendly suggestion."
Aunte Em Aunte Em
Maybe he pulled a bill clinton...had to get him out quick.
This is as good as it gets. UNH is a bloated pig with massive downside.
"I don't understand why UNH does not follow the market. I just wait for UNH to go down 2-3 points, I need some cheap price. I guess UNH will hit 270 by the 3rd week of July."
Unh- hard to believe they beat
"Come on UNH, buy Walgreens. It's cheap"
"THIS IS A GIFT-Healthcare is not going to change anytime soon. The target may be big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers but this will not hurt UNH. When drug prices go down, so do our costs. Optum has already announced that rebates will go to patients so we are proactive on that front. What is driving the price is FEAR. In my thirty years of investing I have learned that other peoples Fear leads to great profits. Be brave and ride this out."
"This is the real question: ""Do you have the stomach to hold through the upcoming turmoil of the election years?"""
"Typical Friday short covering. Will it carryover to next week? Still ten days out from Earnings, so will we see a runup before?"
I just love how the brokers front run everyones trades with their computer trading
In at 250 today... Will double down is it goes lower.
"The Orange Nightmare has made the market uninvestible. No group of stocks is safe from an unexpected, idiotic tweet."
"Mad money and Cramer still like UNH. I don't care, but alot of people follow them like sheep."
Going greenGo UNH ! $$
Shorts Squeeze big time. I heard about screams out of the shorts.
"THIS MAKES NO SENSE- I am a retired ophthalmologist and dealt with UNH for most of my 30 year career. As a physician, they were by far the toughest HMO to deal with. They were always managing costs, fighting md's to use generics, etc. As an investor it makes no sense to me why the stock is getting hammered today. We are never going to get medicare for all in the next 5 to 10 years. It won't happen, no chance. Even if Trump loses in 2020 and somehow the Dems get it passed, the government is not prepared to manage 300 million lives!!!! (They can't even run the post office, how are they going to manage healthcare?) The reality of the situation is that if we ever do get medicare for all, the government will be forced to farm out tens of millions of covered lives to HMO's. In that case, they will use UNH. UNH makes more profit from their Medicare Advantage plans than anything else. With earnings just a few days away, only thing I can think of is a leak of bad news. In that case, think the stock is still undervalued at these levels. Reminds me of Fedex. They badly missed their numbers a few weeks ago, and within days the stock was back up. Am I missing something? Please let me know."
let's power through 300!!!
unh is a bargain.... not wise to sell it... naysayers not always sane...
"why is 308, 309 such a hard resistance to punch through?"
Any body care for Medicare for all ??
Totally helpless stock. Every little slight bounce is sold off immediately and the lower Lows continue even when the markets are up a lot. Boy Lizzy Warren and crazy Bernie sure killed this stock
I'm no analyst but man to stop this thing....nevermind you wont. Slow progress but earnings will keep piling in.
Sell this rally! Last chance...
Time to buy
"prepare for 242.50 or higher, today."
so happy i sold my position weeks ago fell through my stop other prospects keep me out.
It hurts though’ do you think it can still go back to 225?
UNH is good to hold for LONG term investor. It is very sleepy if you are option trader.
A perfect buffet buy
"this is very frustrating, market is flying and this #$%$ tanks... not good"
Watch the market makers who try to take you to the top and let you hang dry. I like the sector but stock itself trading like YOYO. I will buy UNH when it is red only.
"Here it goes again, sell into the close....too funny, they are really FN the day traders. Endo of month, options exp, fake congress meeting to say they are gonna do something about rebates and nationalize health care, but in the end, do nothing but manipulate the market. I am sure congress and their buddies trade on the fake news"
Buy the dip
#eric Get a grip on reality. You have just been taken to the cleaners!
"UNH is one of the big PBM, with Trump withdrew from the issue. UNH will be so happy. UNH will report earnings on Thursday morning, I guess UNH will hit bullseye as usual."
"I hear that Uncle Bernie is going to stop calling himself a socialist. Instead, in order to get the military vote, he's going take a gamble and call himself a National Socialist...and, changing the name of the Democratic Party to ""The National Socialist American Workers Party""..."
Giving it all back. Bummer...
"BARRONS recommends a BUY for UNH since yesterday. Someone knew in advance yesterday, this is the real reason UNH pop up yesterday and today."
sits right below tech breakout 220... grrrr
A lot of shareholders are probably looking to get out and this small 2 day bump that was gave them just that.
YTD UNH is down 6% while the NASDQ is up 13% and the overall market is up too. Since it seems there is no news at least for the public there seems to be something going on. The down trend has been long enough to raise concern that it may not be just market cycles. Any thoughts?
If this gaps down tomorrow it will likely go straight to 235.00. About a 70 percent chance of a down open since it was so weak at the close. Or there may be about a 30 percent chance this opens up by a 1.00 -1.50. If so it will reverse within 10 minutes and then go to 235. Either way this pos is in trouble because the market hates it and it has no real buy interest
What did I tell you. This stock is totally broken garbage. I told you it was going much much lower and it lost 1.30 in the next 5 minutes
Pumpers have taken over the board.... Sigh.
Overbought. Be careful.
Back to the 50 dma. A positive sign.
Foookin junk. Stock is junk
"IT IS NO BRAINER STOCK, IF YOU DON'T BUY UNH AT THIS PRICE, YOU WILL KICK YOURSELF ON OCT 17."
Punished for good earnings?
disgusting
"eric sounds like a person full of negative thoughts, or he has lost so much on unh, that he hates unh more then he hates trump...???"
"dow up 400, UNH down. Dow up 100, UNH down again. Dow down just 60 points.....UNH down $3.00Stock is pathetic. Funds selling"
"This is bianary choice. If you believe in Medicare for All will be implemented with a Democrat in office you should sell all healthcare insurance companies now. If you think there is little chance that Medicare for All will actually happen then hold. Elizabeth Warren has the best of the Medicare for All plans and how she thinks she will pay for it. But, remember healthcare is 20% of the entire US economy with embeded private sector companies virtually everywhere. She has not thought about what will happen to all the companies that will no longer be relevant with a Medicare for All plan. Think about all the insurance companies which are public and will kill the stockholders and employees. What will happen? Also, whe wants to reduce the cost of perscription drugs by 70%! What! That would be great but then what happens to all of the big phara companies? Again, what happens. It is just too much to consider. It would take a generation to implement a plan that might work."
Where’s all the posters? Great day today
Perhaps now you understand the meaning of Sell the Rally?
Worst stock in the world
UNH will go way higher tmrw paybe close to $240.........GLTA
"I'm going to keep my October 16 calls ($7000 worth.) Big gamble, will either be worth 20k tomorrow or zero. I hope I'm not being to dumb. Any thoughts?"
"The market makers did ti again. WOW, I can not believe it that UNH will be red early in the morning. UNH is the number one in DOW 30. WMT can not be new high, that is surprise me a lot."
"CV-19 will leave a lot of UNH policy holders with surprise ER bills. Trump let his ""surprise medical bill"" bill sink into the swamp. Now he'll be feeling the Bern."
Geddie Up !
"What a bunch of panicked sheep. You would think a bill had passed today. Thank you sellers, easy buy here."
$600 by Halloween.
Tommy - what the hell are you talking about? Are you a pessimist? Do you have a crystal ball? United Health is a great company.
"Yep, it's acting like a complete BUM. What is wrong with this thing? Acts like it has some sort of disease..."
What happened to UNH today? Good earnings report. Yet the stock tanks. It has been flat for past quarter. I am selling tomorrow.
That was a gift
Same #$%$ hedge fund punks keep shorting. Don?t rush in or else they?ll short after each uphill
WBA RAD UNH SECTOR ALL GREENANOTHER UNDER PERFORMANCE. 37 OF 41
Can you imagine what would happen if something occurred that actually effected the business? Cuz nothing has.
Great decision to sell this at 241.70 this morning. Stock is dead. I will buy it back if it reaches 241.75. No need to catch a falling knife. The market will be down tomorrow
350 on the way!
"Just make it simple, just buy UNH as long as AAPL and MSFT are in green, because both of them are in DOW 30, and are in top 5. UNH right now is the number one in DOW,"
Harris is for Medicare for all. Is that bad for UNH? Any opinions. Is she looking for the destruction of private I surance
Those 245 strikes must be the play. Typical Wall Street. Stock is dead. Congrats whoever is holding this down toy have been able to do it
"The big boys manipulate UNH at full tilt. I watch it joyfully. It looks like a lot of big mutual funds take turn to buy and sell. XLV is positive but UNH is negative, let's see how UNH will end at the close today."
As the highest priced DOW component I hope the board considers a 2 for 1 in 2021
"Is Bloomberg running to defeat Warren and save the Wall Street types from her Wealth Tax? This could spark a backlash and generate even more support for her. I like both of them as an alternative to Stumpy. I believe either could beat him. We'll see who Stumpy focuses his attention on today in Sunrise as he Stumps in Florida. But in any case, UNH is highly overbought and set up for a major crash. Looking for at least a ten to twenty percent crash on any favorable news about Warren."
I think the quick spike is due to AG Barr's testimony about the ACA.
30 Trillion???Ask Red Bernie for a loan!
"healthcare bloodbath....Vote for Uncle Bernie...Just make sure that you don't own ANY healthcare stocks or, Big Tech..."
Is everyone short squeezing in this week before the earnings report next week!?
funny how this stock moved up by the same amount more or less yesterday with no big news
Today was to be expected. Hoping to finish the week above 233 tho
wait for morning dip tomorrow to get back in?
UNH type companies squeeze so much money from our system that the government need to step in and offer the same services of UNH at no profits. The government will need to manufacture generic drugs at no profits to squeeze the cost down
Man... i always buy at the wrong times
I'm always glad to see experts like Tommy to tell me what stocks to buy. (Or sell.)
"Normal insurance markets, like vehicle, have seen their costs plummet, and they're 'refunding' future premiums to prevent a price war (this is really a price cut). Consumers so far are too dumb to do the math for vehicle insurers and are glad they're getting a 'refund'. Healthcare is not paid by individuals, so the healthcare companies or HMO doctors will keep the excess profit."
This stock is down following a great earnings report ! Is the run over?
UNH = Chinese water torture
$220 did not hold.....see if $214 holds.....
220 come to papa
Sky high medical insurance is going to fuel single payer system. Insurance companies got greedy
We all were waiting for the post earnings bounce. I guess the smart money knew the market was going to sell the market no matter what the earnings were so sellers are getting out ahead of it.
"selloff yesterday was ridiculous and unwarranted. should've been up $5-$10 yesterday on earnings/ revenue/ and upped guidance.that was a market manipulated selloff. it's as if market is pricing in bernie sanders as being official nominee with AOC as his vice presidential running mate! come on. get real. we r so far off from that. we r gonna fill the gap and rally big time up today and for next few days. those that didnt buy yesterday will regret great buying opporrunity. actually UNH fell considerably less than other insurers. up, up, and away today"
300 by mid December
Buy before the earnings on 07/17! Don't b sorry!! Will hit way over $260 GLTA.........
When there's blood in the street that's when you come in and buy em up! Totally oversold across the board!
Where Bill Johnson at?
Looking piggish
For all those who are nor sure what is goin it’s because Bernie is rising in the polls in Iowa

Kinda hungry too. throw in a millet mignon for dinner
"IBM and UNH are today's whipping boys. Check this out from Barrons this morning. ....The price-weighted Dow, however, would be up if it weren't for two stocks: IBM (IBM) and UnitedHealth ( UNH). Both have price tags well over $100 a share, and both are getting hit hard today, though for different reasons.IBM ( IBM ) stock has slumped 7.46, or 5.1%, to $137.68, after its sales fell short of analyst expectations. That's accounted for 47.99 points of the Dow's decline. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) stock has fallen 6.65, or 3%, to $214.31, on continued fears about ""Medicare for All."" Its drop accounts for 43.74 of Dow downside.Together, the two stocks account for just nearly 92 points of downside, and without them, the index would be up just over 45 points. Today, you really can blame just two stocks for the decline."
Bloomberg backs Biden. Game over for Bernie.
Pardon for sounding like a broken record...Another 52 week high!!!On the way to $400...soon...
time to fire up the lawsuits against Bernie and warren
Over $200 by the end of this year! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ GLTA
"Buy UNH now because it is still on Sales now. UNH's PE is around 20 with dividends, earnings growth rate is over 25% because of great cash flow management. The most important thing is UNH beats estimate the last two years because of OPTUM."
"Head and Shoulders pattern now formed. If UNH does not break trend soon, going down for the year."
Down yet another open again today. It’s a pattern. Selling every open for a month
Still a huge gap that has not been filled down around 152.85 to 155.15Buy now at your own risk

Another huge underperformance. They really have this stock under wraps. They just won’t let it move up. Dow up 315 and this dog is up 1.45. Dow up 1.2% and this is up half that at .6 percent. Safe to say the manipulators shorted calls and bought puts this week. This stock is just an atm for the firms that make makers in its options then they use alogos to control that price to make the options work for them. What a scam
I wish they hadn’t run up so strongly in anticipation of tomorrow’s earnings. They better be good or we’ll headed sub $300 again. Sleeping with the fingers crossed tonight!
"Big boys try to intimidate the call 220 this week. We will find out what is in the wood, why call 220 is still there over 5000 calls.and 225 around 1000 calls with the expensive premium. We will find out soon in a few days."

I am a buyer at 228.
unh going to $300 after earnings --going to beat the numbers by 30
I cant stop laughing!! any long who voted dumocrat doesn't deserve any profits!! watch and learn you morons.
"Doubled my position at $240, to have a cost average of $250. I believe this is oversold, and I will go down with the ship of I'm wrong."
"Uncle Bernie, AOC and today's Democratic Party....I hope any Dem investors in this stock appreciates this..."
Have you felt the bern? Vote for Biden!!!
hopefully we see a nice pop by the end of the day.
"It is a great price to dip in. The earnings was out, so it will follow the market or itself, we will find out. I like UNH for long term."
"UnitedHealth Group is said to have closed at approximately $368.50 in the latest trading session, marking about a 0.45% move from the prior day while outpacing the S&P 500. That could be a good projection for their earnings report! Meanwhile, it is said that these other companies have advanced by about 442%, reversing strongly with an almost 54.76% hike year-to-date. Seems like a rock-solid potential and bullish technical! Take a look at some of the advanced markets today! This post is sponsored.

"The young ignorant liberals think they'll be getting freebie medicare. The fact is they will be paying taxes and those taxes will be used to take care of baby boomers. Then medicare and social security will run out of money, forcing these ignorant people to retire at much older ages.I am in my late 30's and I am putting max 401K contribution. I'm not stupid enough to count on medicare or social security when I'm due to retire."
"Nish is on a real tear here, blasting away at UNH. This will be back to $225 in just a couple of days, lol."
Finally let’s see if it can close above 235
"Looks like UNH best days are past. Market soars 200 points, UNH is the only red in my portfolio of 42 stocks"
"UNH way oversold based on this. Regards to ""medicare for all"" plan, its still only a proposal. it'll take much to try to make such enormous change in the healthcare industry. Their are major oppositions. quote: ""Most experts believe that the special rules required for reconciliation would prevent Congress from using it to pass Sanders’ proposal."""
"price movement is not always about past earnings, it's about forward guidance. BOTH political parties are calling for lowering healthcare expense for people. As long as they keep up the conversation, UNH could be lowering guidance to be conservative."
"Don't have to think about it now. UNH is no brainer stock at this price. The earnings for this quarter will be boring again. The stock is undervalue at this point. PE is around 20 or less for this year is real cheap. Don't worry about AOC, she has no chance to pass her health care into law. The GOP will not let it happen,."

"not wise to dump today, foundation is very strong, except CEO is replaced."
Guys don’t worry about the drop haha. It’s just Cramer implying that the stock will drop to 261. He did not highlight any basis for this statement so don’t worry about it just accumulate
why is it dripping? bought more again
absolutely amazing health insurance company is making a fortune in stocks. is it any wonder why Healthcare is so expensive
Wow......pumpers out in drove this morning.............Reality is...........UNH pps beats on the down side...........
"As I have said before, this market was looking for an excuse to sell off. I just wish I had taken my own advice a week ago and sold for a small profit. At this point, I am dollar cost averaging down... 250 shares at a time. I was at 248, added more at 239, and again at 235. One more time if it gets to 230. Current basis is 240. Should easily recover to this level once the Healthcare ETFs finish dumping shares. The good news is that Washington will be shutting down for a week through Easter, starting today... No more of this silliness coming from the politicians... at least for a little while. GLTA"
Total junk broke above the short term resistance and then couldn’t move. Why let me tell you why thematlet makers sold too many calls short and cant allow this toMove. It has not one thing to do with Medicare or anything but that the market makers are short calls and won’t allow it to move. Period so you have invested in a stock where the options control the stock and the stock doesn’t control its options anymore
"What did I say over a month ago. Be the first one out the exit. The crooks are telling people to buy HC stocks, creating more bag holders. Don't buy this junk..."

Health insurers getting taken apart today? What's the news?
Ugh not unh
unh will jump bac up to $265 today
up 3%. why??
I tried and tried to tell you people this stock was manipulated junk
"Bernie is doomed, BS is not going anywhere"
$220 before close.
Will see 285 tomorrow.
Another 52 wk high!!!
I added some yesterday I might take another bite today
"All I will say is this... UNH has proven to be BY FAR the best large Health care company at navigating the risks and opportunities presented by legislation and regulation. I get why healthcare is being pummeled right now, but UNH is the place to be in the sector given the uncertainties."
Big loss in the past 2 days!
Two points: Bernie is a whack job. Major short squeeze coming.
"Interesting. Where's the selling pressure going into the weekend? Instead, UNH just jumped up over 5 bucks on half the usual volume. I don't see a ton of options out there to explain it. Trying to understand this stuff is pointless, some days."
Wow total scam price action here. 231 is just some magic number I guess. A stock that trades violently between 270 and 220 and just somehow it has found perfect equilibrium and calmness at 231.00.Or.......maybe it’s an option scam since today is a option expiration. So keep it at 231 for basically two days to protect you puts and call you sold short. This stock is not a stock it’s a slot machine that programmed when it pays out and when it doesn’t. Scam This stock is a scam and today proves it. Why 231.00 I guess that way they can screw the 230 outs and the 232.50 calls both
I'm sure we all agree now that the stock has come back a bit.......mostly because the S&P is up over the last 3 days..........that it's time for another negative headline to knock it down again. There must be something out there that can be printed to make the health insurers crater again.
We go socialism and learn from China.
"UNH should turn green today because UNH is really cheap in this situation. While every thing is violent, health care sector is the best of positive money flow."
I want to send you money !!

This is going down with all the costs of the coronovirus infection and testing
I come back to buy UNH again after it shows sign that the congress will not touch Health Care for All.
going up $5-$10 today. ridiculous selloff yesterday. bernie sanders is a long way away from the whitehouse and his medicare plan for all is even farther away
Amazing stock. All it does is keep going higher; all based on fundamentals unlike TSLA or AMZN..

You think the Health Care vote will affect this stock? Afraid to sell since you should refrain from selling stock in uptrend which makes me think it might have a pullback giving others a chance to get in ???
sell going down big Monday

This is one crazy trader. Up $10 at the open only to go negative. I hate it when the computers take over making the stock price in no way reflect the underlying biz.
Question for the board. If the House tax bill is adopted by Congress and passes it means $25B in mandatory cuts to Medicare in 2018 and more to come. Isn't that a substantial negative for UNH? Is the stock up with the rest of the market due to ignorance or because investors don't think Medicare cuts will happen?
cha ching Bing bing
"Well, this has certainly been a good stock to own."
Bouncing on news Trump administration dropping plan to eliminate rebates from drug makers to PBM's.
"last week was a bull trap, going lower"
should bounce around $215don't mean it will
Lol up 9 on that sorry #$%$$$ report ? Th entire revenue gain was premium hikes. Business isn?t growing otherwise whatsoever and people buy that.At some point raising premiums about the inflation rate is going to mount political pressure from all sides. This method of revenue growth is unsustainable as you just can?t jack premiums 7-10 percent year after year after year and premium payers not push politicians to step in
That is why the premium goes up year to year just to pay share holders !!!! Newer 52 week highs!!
Melt ups always end badly. It's a Big Money Grab.
...UnitedHealth is a bargain stock and Wall Street professionals know it....
"ANTM stock price is 228, UNH bigger and better is 222. Go figure it out."

7% gain today?! I was really not expecting this big of a move. It's actually unsettling.
index closing date to push it down to buy with so much sideline money
"We're down more than NVDA, during a tech led selloff. /sigh"
"I've been running stock screens and looking for safety I ran one requiring a 5 Star/Strong Buy rating from CFRA along with an A or A+ S&P Quality Rating. UNH passed the test. It's also rated a 4-star buy by Morningstar and a Buy by Merrill Lynch. Current price of $205.58. CFRA's target is $352; Morningstar's is $304 and Merrill's is $345. Beta is 1.09 and short interest is .93. All looks good as well as safe but maybe not.....my concern is hospitals will be at full capacity but many of those folks may be without insurance coverage - either from getting fired/laid off from this crisis and/or from not having insurance coverage to begin with. Additionally, many smaller and even bigger employers may go under and no longer pay premiums and cancel plans. I'm not sure how big an issue this could be but it is one worth taking into consideration. Also consider many of these hospitalizations may likely be for critical care - ventilator-required, etc. which are typically very high revenue charges but - if the folks are on plans - UNH, Anthem or any other insurers will be strained for profits. I might very well be missing something so comments are appreciated."
Broke the support at 241.26 on heavy volume. Next support is 238.65. If that doesn’t hold(frankly I think it breaks tomorrow) then next support is 233.80 and 231.59. His could get very very ugly because I seen no buyers until the close and no way those buyers just showed up. That was the specialist and MM being nice trying to keep an orderly market. If this pops anytime at the open or soon after then it will be a short lived bounce and I’d sell half. Or all because this stock is going lower. I guess weak holders are selling because the chart is broken and elizebeth warren is catching dementia Joe. Funny thing is that everyone in the democrat party is talking Medicare for all but seriously that isn’t going to happen. Too many people work in healthcare and too many people are all ready on Medicare that worked and waited their whole lives to be on Medicare that Warren will never pass it. Never. Still the sellers are selling and the buyers aren’t buying now and yet so I disagree ultimately but lower it’s going regardless of what I think or believe
Do you guys think this will be back to 230?? Pls share ya opinions
I'm thinking some of the sector bounce has to do with healthcare lagging in Q1 so fund money came back in for window dressing in order to take advantage of the expected Q2 bounce higher as the companies report earnings.
load them puts kids
buying window always seems so short with UNH - my buys were at sub-220
"Panic selling, happens to health care sector this morning, which I believe after it subsides, health care sector will roll back to new high again."
They need to stop this nonsense an slet this break out. They have played enough games already and this is becoming obvious and the . SEC needs to step in
Anyone buying this is truly gullible. The smart people found the exit months ago...
Soooooooooooo lol what do they do tomorrow ? I have all kinds of 230 puts and 230 calls lol. All they can do to beat me is keep it at 229.50 - 230.50 all day long.Actually this stock is such a rigged scam I would be at all surprised if this traded exactly that way so my puts lose and my calls lose
House Democrats are introducing a bill for Universal Health Coverage for all which would basically shut down all private insurance carriers. This is the reason for the sell off. I am loading up for 2 reasons.1. Universal Health Care for all is unaffordable and will never pass both houses of congress.2. If it were to pass Trump would veto the bill.
Fundamentally..I don't understand the downturn in stock price

The CFO blew up the conference call. He said 2019 revenue could come in light because UNH withdrew from a state Medicaid program and one customer was involved in a merger that I guess will result in a reduction in force This is not a reason to drop the stock 6 points and reverse it from a 4 point gain premarket.Wall Street is full of idiots and investors pay the price.

Earnings Wednesday any predictions??
Why down
"I have seen this game before... Drop the stock 5%, make all the weak hands sell, then move in toward close and buy. Only this time there are strong earnings to fuel the rally."
It will turn higher every day till July 18 and pop up to 275-280.
Bernie will win NH. He will be in the news. You are crazy to buy this stock at these levels. Sell the rally. Lots of other people will be doing just that.
UNH is down 11.88% to 239.73
"UNH needs to reach 257-258 by the end of the month. Today it is only hiccup, because it is up over 10 points this week. I believe the Fed will hold the rate from now on, and may cut the rate in third quarter, because every thing is slow down."
UNH provides Medicaid Insurance both under ACA and to various states in general under the Medicaid program and this bill if passes could impair future earnings growth for UNH because of that.
Is UNH approaching another 52-week Low?
"Rise into the close, end up at $225?"
"talking heads clueless..........now UHC will be able to sell products that customers want rather than TELLING them what they have to buy like NOW,,,,,27 year old males have to include OBGYN coverage under ACA.....therefore any changes to lessen mandates will help UHC not hurt it."
Medicare and Medicaid to the rescue!!! UNH is a division of the US government. 50 billion or so from the tax payers!
Why is this falling for no reason? Any news ? Links please
We probably see 253-254 today which is very good sign that lot of investors see the value of UNH. it is suppose to hit 260 this week.
This sleeper stock has gone up 15 points in the last 5 days.
lookout below....the pbm ride is over my friends
Hope it goes back to $2050 tomorrow.
The Dems' Medicare for all has ZERO chance of becoming law (cost too much). As soon as the free fall ends I'm loading up = an excellent low term investment. I' also looking at ANTM.

It is the perfect position for UNH to hold until July 17. I see UNH to hit new high around 265-270. Earnings is super beat the estimate because of the excellent capital management. ROE is in the 25-30% which is top tier because UNH is the big cap stock. It is hard to find the company of this size which the earnings growth in the 20s% plus dividends.
"what ever today’s issue is seems to be localized in the healthcare sector rather than market wide.. So, is it a political headline risk thing, debate jitters, A vague fear of Bernie? Is it some sort of earnings conference call problem? The drop in all of the hmos could trace to a Unh conference call fear.. If Unh drops they will all drop.. but it seems as if the drop is too even across the board to be Unh centric. A flu hospitalization fear can cause sudden drops, just the way a hurricane hits the real estate insurance companies.. I’m waiting and watching, tempted to do a short term bullish trade.. But for the moment, sitting on my hands"
Thank you Democratic House!
UNH could turn negative.
Who Whoooooooooo. YEs
Somebody can tell what happen with unh
Uncle Bernie new GHU candidate for all healthcare!
Investors don’t like the new ceo
52 week high...what else can a man ask for?
"UNH will test the high before end of the month. The earnings will hit high note again because UNH knows how to manage the book. The buy back program helps making every thing easier than you think. The great thing this company does the best is to manage the capital, control the cost to increase the profit margin that no body in the health sector can do,."
I thought it had a chance at a close above $295 but the mothers put the lid on to keep the options contracts from closing in the money.

Healthcare has been screwed up for years ever since the idiots in Washington decided to govern policies and now they want to screw it up more with Medicare for All! I don’t think so! Americans are already totally po’d with their healthcare and would never tolerate further intervention. If you want socialism move to communist China!
"CEO bought UNH for 4.6 million dollars to show the confidence he has in the company, which is really good sign. I just wait to buy it when it is red tomorrow."
It will go red again
Jeez. Big buying opportunity for anyone who believes this Medicare for All is just hype.
"It is a good time to buy UNH today, because it is a good stock that the interest rate can not rattle. Only thing that will hurt this stock is the whole market tanks, beside that i don't see the reason why this stock will not hit 280 by Oct 16."

appears 240 written on the wall...
UNH is returning to up-trend. Jump in now!!!
"Let's see what Stumpy has to say this evening in Michigan. If the repeal of the ACA is in his stump speech, you can bet we'll be hearing a lot more of it in coming months."
What is happening eric? I see buyers. I guess your panic mongering is worthless.
UNH seperates itself from others with this earnings release plus raising full year guidance solidifies UNH powerful growth vs bernie sanders rhetoric and him admiiting the bill has no chance of passing. UNH is still the beast in healthcare.
"The market makers try to put lid on CI, or they want to accumulate more shares. I promise that if UNH hits 275-280, all my profit will go into CI and CNC."
"Mr clown pants Wichmann leaving is a positive.....The ""it's my turn"" mentality was of no benefit to shareholders. An empty suit is being replaced with someone with more ambition and better focus IMO. G.L."
Really don't like the way it's acting in a flat tape. Down below the 50 dma for no reason I can see. Supposed to be a defensive play with reliable growth. No way it should be this weak.
Wow in free fall and you can’t blame the market it’s up big. Lol this stock is a total scam joke
so will it move by $5+ a share after earnings?
"Never in my lifetime did I ever thought I would see UNH selling as a ""K-Mart Blue light special."""
UNH Over $200 By Spring!!! GLTA
Expect another beating today and over the next few days as trump wants to destroy Obama care
I’m got want to make a very substantial investment into RCAR
"Time to buy now, I don't think that UNH will got sold off this much. Health care sector is the strongest with dividends."
Bernie won NH...unh will go higher tomorrow since Bernie has the lowest chance to beat Trump....
"Why has there been so much volatility in this stock recently? It has done gyrations similar to this in the past, but it has been a while. Obviously the market has been on a bear trend since late September, early October, however, UNH is a bellweather and has stayed steady, gone up, dropped, gone back up to new highs, dropped again, and currently is moving between 260 and 270. Is there anything other than just the market ""rebalancing"" to make this thing move like this?"
How's it going for you today Eric? hahahaha
"800,000 shares dumped the last 8 minutes and stock lost 1.30"
Enjoy today!
This will go red today too this is a bear market just getting underway it is pumped and dumped repeatedly the pros use this one because it is the top dollar one then they sell other stocks then they sell this one.Bear market !
Bernie Sanders should teach the poor people how to be rich not promoting laziness else Bernie should give them inspiration to thrive.
"$300 stock, thanks to the democrats its now a dog"
When does it stop. Good grief.
What a disgusting day for UNH. Luckily I was able to cut my losses in half by catching the falling knife with some option calls.
this is broken
div time is close..... figured folks would be getting in not out.
more consolidation and heading to $212 by friday
i just step in to buy more UNH again. AT this price i think it is too low .
Totally manipulated by Goldie and naked short con men
"In addition to Barry, is this lawsuit the other ""news"" others were referring too that could be dragging down prices?"
good hatchet job by aoc!
UNH will shoot up to the moon
What the HECK!
"Optum is still making very good profits.Revenue is down due to people being laid off most of the quarter.With people coming back to work, revenue will pick up.This revenue pickup will help offsetting people having medicaltreatments that they put off due to covid-19.Longs: don't sell to shorts..."
just sad
"4 Days ago I said 220 here we come (scroll down). Yes we got there a bit faster than I thought. For some, this may be a good entry point, but given the nature of the market, I would hold out for sub 200 at this point. Lets just say 198 for jollies. I don;t have a position currently."
hold steady!
It’s always that 2 million shares that trade in block when it moves either up or down. Same mfs
What another great buying opportunity. Managed healthcare is going nowhere
BUy any weakness on UNH/ANTM/HUM/CI which will benefit from coronavirus and .....
low volume...
"Nasdaq Composite Tulip Mania BUBBLE got PUMPED by 170% since March 2020, despite so much terrible news, thanks to Coronavirus Pandemic. Without Pandemic Coronavirus NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE would be around 6000-7000... We need MORE PANDEMICS to PUMP NASDAQ Composite by 200% per year!!!$FB $UNH $BABA"
Time to get in!
Where did this thing close and why did it fall off the table at the close?
anybody know why the big drop today?
"monday madness !!! lucky me , i bought it when price is much less !!!"
UNH reached a new All Time High at 241.36
This stock want to go higher! I’m in!
"THIS MAKES NO SENSE-Nice beat by UNH, guidance was raised, best of breed company. The issue that gov't has with pharmacy benefit managers is that they keep rebates instead of giving them to patients. UNH has been proactive in this respect and is committed to giving the rebates directly to patients. Second issue is risk of medicare for all. As a physician with 30 years experience I am confident that this WILL NOT HAPPEN. Certainly not with Trump as POTUS. Even if democrats win in 2020 would take a 60-40 vote in Senate which is extremely unlikely. If by some remote chance that the bill were ever to pass, UNH will still be in great shape. The fact is that the government does not have the skill or resources to manage the care of 300 million lives. They will do exactly what they do with current Medicare Advantage plans. They outsource the lives to HMO's and pay a capitated payment(dollars per member per month) to the insurance company. UNH does very well on these plans as they can control the doctor panel , hospital payments and drug costs. UNH does this better than any other HMO. I know, as I had to deal with them for 30 painful years. They fight hard to control utilization and costs. At the end of the day, this is a great company with sound fundamentals. Don't know that the market really gets it. If you really think Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren will be our next president than sell the stock but odds of that happening are remote at best."
"Tonight you will have a dozen politicians make the case of drastic changes in health care,..I would wait the night and see what it does tomorrow morning."
"I wonder if yesterday's drop, more than likely related to the release of the House budget, was in anticipation of a negative ruling for UNH???https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-suffers-setback-lawsuit-against-170047158.html"
Take your money and run
i sold 6 months ago 165 glad i sold
Any reason we are tanking today?
UNDERVALUED at this level.
Bought 250 shares today!!! Good luck my long friends!!!
I bailed yesterday...have fun
LMAO....You just got AMAZONED ! ;)
Below 150 Soon
"just my luck, this trash has no legs.. one step forward, 5 fn steps back."
This stock is helpless
Earnings tomorrow morning will beat the estimate about a mile. I guess that price will move around 4-6%.
It’s Cramer guys... he said to buy at 261
i tried to warn u guys....
Bottom line: as predicted trading sideway between 230-260. You know what that means
target $200 ... short it
285 today
SELL SHORT NO GO DOWN MORE MORE MORE
"Panic is the best word for today market drop. Dow 30 has the best stock just a few. AAPL, BA and UNH. BA has big problem right now, It will take time at least a year for stock to rebound back. The investors will take less time than that. BA monopolizes the aviation sector, so it will take time to persuade all the carriers come back, but they have to do it because it is very efficient and safe at least 16%. UNH so is the best in the Dow now, and I don't believe that any politicians can hurt UNH. So watch mid April, UNH has the chance to beat estimate around 6=8%."
Stock price has gone parabolic in the last 4-5 years. Just crazy gambling going on.
Healthcare stocks usually do very well from May through September.
Shares have been moving based on geopolitical situations impacted overall market direction and with earning 1/15 and reports seeing upside revisions should see $310 in very near future and $320 by Q2.
Naked shirt fraud where is the gd management
I'm really surprised that so many people are bailing on UNH. No matter who is elected I think they'll figure this out.
"Just my luck, I worked for 40 some years and been paying into Medicare. Now I turn 65 next month and get on Medicare and next year Democrats are going to give EVERYONE Medicare. And also forgive THEIR student loans. Sigh...."
Totally completely criminally manipulated with naked short sales
http://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/~/media/9BD99B944CD14001BD543895B569ED0C.ashxUnited Health posted this 1 year ago expecting 2016 earnings to be about 7.30 and now they are saying 8 This year at the investor conference they said earnings will be 9.60 for 2017 so based on last year we could really end 2017 at 10.52 and the current trailing PE ratio is 21.64 so that gives us a price of 227.61 one year from today about a 43 % gain. Awsome
These insurance companies sooner or later will plummet ... Trump is looking at you
Nearly 4X the daily volume is absolutely crazy.
Bernie town hall on CNN tonight. Some mention of M4ALL being phased in over 4 years with incremental coverage of certain things.
UNH is the parking place when there is turmoil in the market.
junk
"UNH should report stellar earnings. Quote : ""Strong Fourth Quarter RevenuesInvestors had more than UnitedHealth’s $226 billion in quarterly revenue, up 12% year-on-year, to appreciate. Optum’s revenue crossed the $100 billion level for the first time, helping to add to the $3.10 EPS in the quarter. UNH earned $12.19 a share for the full year, valuing the stock at 20.8 times earnings. Its 2019 EPS outlook for 2019 is even better, with net earnings expected to come in at $13.70 - $14.00 a share. That brings down the forward P/E to 15.3 times.These multiples are noteworthy because UNH’s revenue growth will likely accelerate at a faster rate, thanks to the positive contributions of Optum. In 2018, the unit only added modestly to results. Yet as UNH continues to dedicate itself to improving health and wellness, saving money for the customers it serves, profits will grow.UnitedHealth added 2.4 million more people in 2018. Full earnings grew 7.2% to $9.1 billion."""
"It will be green today, do not give up hope....Just say no to Bernie, buy UNH."
Unh is one of the biggest if not THE biggest administrators of Medicare. But now!
"Healthcare is very complex and I understand why political smoke blowing may scare some people, but UNH will get theirs. I can't see a scenario where they don't profit. #TooBigToFailUninformed and scared sellers started this panic. Now, traders are playing around with it.It will be back in a few weeks."
hopefully we see an end of the day rally.
UNH is down 7.48% to 191.13
Looks like a good capitulation point to me. Bonce from here and head up into earnings.
"This is a problem for the entire health care system. If we could solve this problem with a simple control chain, we'd have solved the problem long ago. There's a lot of interest groups involved. There's no way he could actually solve the problem. I don't think so."
Sell take your profits before it gets worst
Sell now? Is it going to get this good again?
"I'm guessing the SEC doesn't monitor short selling within hedge funds. There is no reason for this stock to be down. The company pays .90 cents per share dividend. It beat earnings, revenue and raised guidance. The stock trades with a P/E of around 19. Beyond Meat up over 160% and doesn't make money yet. UNH sits stalled on Bernie Sanders saying he wants Medicare For All? What happened to peoples brains?"
Should pop above $240 and hopefully up to 243-245 with the market so good today
NO NO NO NO DONT GO UP NO NO
Good healthy pullback today after a reaching a new 52 week high. This stock has ran up way too fast in recent weeks. Need a breather and a nice base before the run over $240.
Wow.. “We will never socialize US medicine!” To wild cheers in a state of the union speech is like rocket fuel for UNH
"Look at this bum stock drop again. That's all it does, down-down. I wished my Mutual Fund would drop this loser."
You people are stupid . Let’s see how confident when it falls another 30
"Now you see yet that the market makers did all the dirty work, suppress the price down more than 10 points, then accumulate when the weaker hands surrender, so it is time to hand it to the hedge fund who buys the stock for long term."
JUST BUY IT!
I will continue to hold my position
going higher
"I guess there will be some big news come in this week, otherwise, the premium of call 225 should not be this high. It is unbelievable for the call 220 open interest is still 5000 contracts. Let see some one knows something or gamble."
It takes Dow up 250 for this POS to be up .70 lol. Can’t blame the market
today we will be seeing green
"damn, big buying blocks"
Going to dance with $225 premarket. Looking bullish for now.
This will go below 150 sooh
why just 0.8 percent up when markets are up more than 2 percent.....was expecting a 5 percent up today
"AOC is the one who will screw the Democrat by accident. I really love her great idea. She is so great in the House even though it is just her first term. You can tell Democrat will be even worse this time around. I am just feel bad that US is such a great country but we have both bad president and the House. I feel so sorry for the Long Island citizen. It may not your idea not to take AMZN, but she got the vote from you, so now you got to bear the consequence. I guess she does not get good grade in Math in school."
Market just hates this pos terrrd. YouHave Apple with allKinda of exposure to China and it’s up. Lol. Unh has zero China exposure. What idiots sell unh and put it into apple? Totally insane market
"wow, a slight downgrade in debt causes a big drop in the stock? seems like nuts."
Told you not to sell. Bouncing back when the rest of the market folds. Sector swap coming soon.
back to 250 this week.
"bought in $264.20...great buy under $250... great sell over $280... target peak $310 (will hit over the next 12 months)...Good luck! one more thing, election coming soon Trump will do anything in his power to bring the market up"
Seriously people this stock sucks
From a stock that could never go up to a stock that never goes down lolWall Street is bull sheet
Lets wipe out all insurances in the country & live happily ever after.
Coming back down
will drop like a rock

UNH just wants to end green today. It is trying so hard
"CNBC says this thing is down because of Bernie Sanders...So, thank your friends who are Democrats."
Nice
keep going down daily
Shorts and market makers I. Total control of this
"I AM CONFUSED,THE ANALYST UPGRADES OR DOWNGRADES UNH."
"Patience paid off, was holding UNH for months, all the way down to $215"
"There's really strong support at 223. YTD low, so if you haven't bailed yet there's no reason to now. On the contrary it likely finds support and bounces here. So better to add to position"
My puts are up big. Wait until the market reverses because it’s up too much to past week
Time to buy a little??
"Regardless of which way the market goes, UNH always goes down these days. Really sad!"
"Some weak hands let go UNH this morning, make me feel pity for them. The yield curve or the interest rate has nothing to do with health care sector at all. It is even better because the rate will come lower, cheaper to borrow. i still keep my position because I believe that UNH will beat estimate big time again. Funny thing UNH's high is 285, so I believe UNH is still undervalue."
AARP destroyed this company with their strong support for obummer care! Thought they could make a bundle peddling their gap insurance through UNH!
https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/unh
Isn’t this a perfect time for UNH to accelerate their buyback program?
UNH is a very well managed company. I bought at @59.15 back in 2006 and rode it thru when it went down to mid 20s. No matter what happens with one payer system etc. this company will re-invent themselves and shine in the long run. I feel $250 is a great entry point and if one can hold it long term will gain tremendously.
This is one of my buy it and forget it stocks. In my view a real super investment for the long run.
Had a great week. Happy Easter everyone. Going to the tiki bar. Out
"What could happened if we are heading to recession, less people covered ?"

Out at 267. Too much downside potential in the short run... Will buy back in 240-250 range.

UNH will end the day up a paltry dollar while the market gains 400pts....

Democrats are meeting today to figure out how they can finish imposing Socialist state run healthcare on the American people. With themselves exempt of course.
Wish this offered a higher dividend.
"So, it is often asked, which feels worse, selling too soon and missing out on a rally? Or holding too long and getting stuck in a downward trade and maybe taking a loss? It's usually the latter as people dwell on their losses longer. You decide. When you sell a rally, you get satisfaction that you made a profit... most of the time."
240$ by the end of the day BUY BUY BUY!
Time to short this thing. AOC is going to give you single payer whether you like it or not.
so the SEC decided to crack down on the wallstreetbets on GME and let the hedgefund manupilate UNH down

UNH will skyrocket in few days because of ACA court ruling. going super long
5 day till earnings. UNH will beat the street estimate

Bernie and the rest of the democrats 2020. A stock shorters dream....
"Time to buy, it is no brainer stock. earnings will beat the estimate again. laughable matter is UNH is cheaper than ANTM."
im close to giving up
"Any body buys UNH when it is deep red this morning? Just hold it until April 18, because UNH will report the earnings that beats the estimate again. At PE 20, I can not resist to buy some options because I believe that the economy is just slow down, not recession. I bet you that health care will be more expensive when Democrats hold the House. It is very simple, why Democrats lost the House to GOP when Obama was president. It is DEJAVU AGAIN."
This stock is no good. It truly is garbage an sahould be taken out of the Dow Jones
"So here is the lesson....in case you missed it. NEVER....EVER , listen to analyst and buy or sell on their upgrades or downgrades. Do you really think that the Jefferies analyst that downgraded UNH only 5 days ago is going to come out and say he was wrong and upgrade the stock???? Of course not.....in fact Jefferies could have been buying the stock on the downgrade. I feel so sorry for innocent individual investors who react to analyst upgrades/downgrades, while the professionals steal their money. There really should be a law."
hpe we see 300. am
"Unh- peak now, down ward soon"
"Bernie Bernie Bernie, you will never be a president old fart"
"Yield curve has any thing to stop sick people not to go see the doctor? It is so funny, I don't understand UNH plunged 6.7 points on Wednesday and going down again today. I just pick my entry point, because I know UNH will beat the estimate again."
This will keep going up.
Trump is good for healthcare? That is funny
Whadaya bet management announces a bigger buyback pretty soon. I'm not sure how much difference it will make but..........
Still a nice long-term gain. Ignore the news.
Last chance to sell this little rally. December Retail sales decline a harbinger of a Bear on the loose. Markets will decline now for weeks to come.
UNH is up 7.82% to 236.98

I said 250 250 250 250. now its move to 260 260 260 260
Buy CVS much better returns with dividend retail pharmacy stores and Aetna you will be rewarded
Get ready to see over $390 tomorrow
"This is going to be in the dumps for awhile. Fund managers found a way to drive fear in the healthcare sector. In the end though a single-payor system won't go anywhere and the Democrats and Republicans will never be able to agree on any change to the current system. So unless the socialist get the House, Senate, and Presidency, this will rise again."
Gap is still open and stochastics have not bottomed yet
This is a junk IMHO ... might Trump trash it?
"From CS.........Adjusting Ests & TP: We are maintaining our 2020 EPS est but raising our 2021 EPSest by $0.10 to $18.60. Additionally, we are raising our TP to $335 (prev $325) based ona blended 18x our 2021 EPS estimate. Risks include any deterioration in governmentenrollment and margins, the economic slowdown, and unexpected increases in utilization."
"Less risk to buy UNH, and premium is reasonable. Better buy it now before it runs away."
Bought at 253 a while ago - I’m not too worried
"There will never be ""Healthcare for All"" and the insurance industry made irrelevant. Just hang on as UNH will ultimately recover. It is down about 3.5% primarily due to the idea of Healthcare for All has a chance."
Great company. May buy some puts though. I do not think Bernie not Sanders can beat trump but all insurance. I pained may take a hit if they win the nomination. No much maybe a 20% clip. They hate entrepreneurs and especially big business And health insurance companies the most
all these people are going to lose their jobs.... I wonder how many of them will vote for Bernie knowing he's crushing their lives.
cool ... shorted
Well I hope Bernie rots in he@@
"WINTER IS COMING - all the scenarios of being oversold and the clarion call that Medicare for All can't happen will be forthcoming from shills in the marketplace, while they slowly unload their positions. By 2020, UNH will be down to under 180."
Get into heath stocks they said. Health is a good sector they said. Whatever.
Eric - the $240 Oct 18 options up 900%. I'm assuming you aren't going to admit you were wrong.
Sell the rally. Probably pre-market only.
ADP report...addition of 2.37 million jobs in JuneThis is good news people...
I cannot believe big investor sold on. News healthcare for all is 2Xtreme of a policy that go through Washington even if Bernie in a craziest way would be president.. in the coast to do that you need to do a major changing of fundamental of this country which will cause the market to crash must be another reason for the selloff which I cannot find
What happened to UNH in 2019. Had a nice steady chart until then?
"why is this stock down more than Anthem, Humana, CVS, etc..? The risk is the existential threat to Managed Care by a Democratically elected president/congress. Wouldn't that hurt these other insurers equally?"
Now the fun begins... run shorts run
"In my part of the country we have a saying ""Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.""United Healthcare will become a better company from this competition and its shareholders will be rewarded. Bookmark this post."
Is this drop really due because just 3 companies are about to start offering healthcare to their employees? That effects probably about .01% of the people UNH look over....if that. Wow.
UNH will hit and exceed $330 at earnings.
UNH is up 5.23% to 263.50
"Raise your hand if you sold below $210, now that it is raised, go ahead and smack yourself."
All analysts recommend UNH a strong buy! Ka boom!
Ive seen drops prior to ER before. Then a bad report. Im suspecting insider information I don't have.
Green at open?!
I can not resist to buy UNH at this price. I believe UNH will rebound with in next week.
What in the hell is going on with these healthcare stocks? This is crazy!
"just came out. Bloomberg,trade deal being signed late may."
my 213 limit filled yay!
Cigna doesn’t hav ether same scammer specialist and market makers
Hard to predict today's close.... a tweet might be around the corner.
It ran up more than 6 yesterday before earnings on a bad market day wonder what kind of run up we could see after a beat and on a Green Day... guess I’ll hold and wait for the market action I’m up either way so I’m happy
Every human being on earth should have some form of health care the only problem is finding a way to pay for it....Liberals would say just cut the defense budget by 50%......
Nice little bandaid on a stab wound today.
"We look for some additional developments around the Trump Administration’s drug price initiatives in 2019. Efforts to encourage greater use of generics and biosimilars are positive for MCOs, as are removing protected drugs and drugs classes, as these steps allow health insurers to negotiate better discounts and rates. On November 26th, CMS released its CY20 proposed rule for Medicare Advantage and Part D drug pricing. CMS is proposing to give MA and Part D plans the option to limit coverage of drugs from formularies in the six categories known as the “protected classes”. One of the tools proposed would be to allow step therapy, similar to the policy allowed for Part B drugs in 2019. This move underscores our view that insurers (and potentially PBMs) are necessary partners in their efforts to lower drug costs. CMS is also considering for a future plan year, which may be as early as 2020, a policy that would ensure that enrollees pay the lowest cost for prescription drugs they pick up at a pharmacy, after taking into account back-end payments from pharmacies to plans through POS rebates. If the industry is given sufficient time to put in place the appropriate bids (implementation after Jan 1 2020) and other mechanisms to reflect the new POS rebate scheme, we believe there would be minimal financial impact to health plans and PBMs. Further, to the extent that Part B converges with Part D, as some Part B drugs are allowed to be negotiated under Part D, it would allow health insurers to bring PBM techniques into the Medicare Part B program (which currently is unmanaged). Additionally, there will continue to be considerable focus in 2019 on any developments out of Amazon’s foray into the pharmacy space, as well as its JV with Berkshire and JPMorgan. Is"
Expect to hear more from Amazon on their Healthcare initiative during the Earnings conference call after hours today. More declines for UNH coming...
Rigged deck
Earnings will beat tomorrow. Big buyback and dividend increase expected. This will be back up 245-250 range end of week.
"Now it looks like UNH will not go under 260. It is very disappointed that UNH goes down today. Look like health care sector should be OK now, but the market must sell off."
"question : stock price 252.6, why July 20,call option @252.50 is $1.20. Why the premium is so high"
Health care stocks are now tanking the markets. Hope these crazy liberals like watching their 401K going down
"Pisani on cnbc says, the Bernie Sanders rehetoric shook 10% off stock price last week but looks to be played out as UNH rebounding Strong 2 days in a roll."
"I don't get it UNH keeps treading water for so long. The medical for all is already done, the company just raises dividends 20%, and the earnings will blow the estimates away again. I will hold the option until earnings come out."
I will short this stock on any pop untill elections are over 2020
"The downturn is insane. First, we will not see single payor for at least 6 to 10 years. Second, UNH is best of breed HMO. Third, the most profitable portion of their business is Medicare Advantage. If we have medicare for all, gov't will farm out populations to HMO at capitated rates per member per month. That is UNH specialty just like they do with their Senior Advantage plans. Fourth, both repubs and dems support lower drug prices which will also create a tailwind for all the HMOs. I am long to the tune of 100 shares but plan to buy 1000 more over the next few days. Think stock could go down to 231 the Dec. 24th low, but there is support at that level. After that predict a trip up to 300 by year's end. I challenge anyone reading this post to tell me why I am wrong. Good Luck to all."
UNH just increased its dividend...
The market in generalHas lost its collective mind. Just irrational parabolic stock actionIn almost all stocks. Printing press rally
This is not acting as quality stock
Price action looks strong. Went below 229 and closed higher! All those who has a stop sell at below 229 are gone. Could be time for a big move to the upside.
"I can not resist to step in to pick up April 18, 240 calls because I think UNH reserves more than this,."
All the healthcare insurance companies are ----ing in their pants over Medicare for all. It won't happen. Too much strength in the private lobby for the industry.
Really UNH. Why do you hate me so
bought a little at 228
"Healthcare system is broken. Drug companies, healthcare companies all needs to show 10% sales gains year after year. Wall Street demands that this they automatically raise prices on drugs, services year after year for the same drug and same service. This model is not sustainable. They simply collapse the system on their own doing."
Here comes $300.00!
Here is goes!!!!!!!GO UNH
that Zack's article was written by a complete moron! Health Insurers want transparency as it is part of the consumerism philosophy. Health Insurers don't make profits by sending more dollars to hospitals.
Walgreens and other companies ramping up to help America with the items and medical supplies need to help CDC and America with assisting the public. $WBA $TGT $WMT $FDA $CDC DOW $SAVE $NCLH $BA $ADBE $GOOGL $UNH $TLT $CLX
"It's pretty clear Bernie won Iowa. I watched C-Span which covered the West Des Moines caucus and Biden didn't even place in the first round as a ""viable"" candidate. Bernie will also win NH. Can anyone stop him now? Woe is me. Looking for another decline in UNH today on the way to the sub 250's on what looks to be an up day for the markets."
The ONLY reason this is down is due to morons who think 23 trillion $$ is ever going to fly. They will drag this HUM and ANTH for as long as possible.
"I don't like UNH price actions seriously, some low-ranking money managers should become more aggressive to bid up UNH:"
"Longs: what do you expect in earning tomorrow?And afterward, will price go up? down?"
No bottom in sight
I'm not sure it's realistic to expect big fund money to come in to the stock before the 5th US District Court of Appeals makes a decision on the lower court decision. Every opinion I've read suggests the court will strike down the lower court ruling..........but you never know.
so much hate
Why? Cause $UNH is a competitor and this is disruptive. Very simple $CLOV has market share
OVERSOLD AND OVERBLOWN
Healthcare will get SMOKED- but the serial underperformer cvS/HIT will get torchedJUST LIKE THE GREAT CLONE SAID
UNH is about to break out soon. See you at $270
Overvalued imho
Why this is down so much ?
"Given the success of Optum and the fact many, if not most, of United Health lives are self-funded by employers, I don't understand the panic. The possibility of Medicare for All (which is likely dead now) was much more troublesome to me."
Buy UNH earnings in a few days beats the street
231 231 231 231 231 231 231 lol on and on and on and on and on all day. Until the close then it drops like a rock
Crash and burn!
"there will never be medicare for all. those politicians talking the talk would never accept medicare for themselves or their families. neither would all the rest of government workers, they have premium plans meaning access to any doctor, the best out there, medicare does not permit access to these whose patients are MOSTLY premium plan or out of pocket....dont believe medicare for ALL if it is not compulsory,"
"Cherry pick is coming now. Buy UNH at this price, it should be safe."
The addiction for UNH may blow up any time now
"Pump n Dump Scheme, about to fall again, smh...."
"UNH along with the other healthcare insurance companies like Cigna and Humana has together suffered together in the stock market primarily due to political discussions about healthcare for all. It seems it doesn't matter what their current performance might be given the prospects that some major changes in the US healthcare system are being discussed by politicians. This isn't going to change until it becomes apparent that healthcare for all isn't sustainable as an idea and not be implemented. So, the decision is to hold or sell now. If we continue to hold UNH and others might be depressed until after the elections in 2020."
ISM SERVICES INDEX DROPPED UNEXPECTEDLY !Business activity fell to 58.9 vs 63.6 prior monthNew orders fell to 58.9 vs 61.2Employment fell to 51.6 vs 55.2Inventory change fell to 48.5 vs 52.0Prices paid fell to 53.5 vs 57.7Backlog of orders fell to 53.0 vs 54
Thank for dropping UNH down over 2 points. I just don't believe it at all. Thanks with sincere.
That’s it Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren stop your crazy idea Medicare for all unless you pay it yourself but if not no free Medicare for All.
Sorry but I’m totally not impressed. This isn’t real buying this is indexing buys. Nothing like real funds with active management deciding to buy
OMG WE'RE ALL GOING TO LOSE IT ALL!!!!
Jerome Powell is a sick man. It’s not his job to bail out stock and stock aren’t down that much. But it is Jerome Powell’s job to adjust the fed rate and for him to ignore the bond market and market rates and arbitrarily set the fed funds at some level that is higher than a not only a 10 year bond but a 30 year bond ? Seriously? The man is stubborn and needs to be fired for being a sick fool that makes up rates in his head
Someone is holding this down for now
Bernie now leading in the polls over Biden....
"Well, the #$%$ gave up another nice day.............as usual."
Can people sue UNH and the drug companies for overcharging in the past?
Does max pain come into play tomorrow or is this beyond that?
Do you think UNH will go for a stock split in near future.rpp
This is responsible for the entire dow gain this indicates how much the market is being sold off...Watch your 401k's evaporate !
who is this Eric guy who seems to have nothing else to do but bad mouth UNH? I'd like to see more of a balance in comments instead of 1 person posting almost hourly.
"Earnings a few weeks out, my guess is they continue to make a boat load of money while everyone worries about things that will never happen. Holding core shares and will add every 10 points down until I double my position."

"Buy CI, it is cheap and undervalue. You will not be disappointed for this stock because it has the biggest PBM in United States."
Why UNH is down $7 today?
This may go lower but I am rebalancing my portfolio adding more Health Care.
Democrats are coming and single payer option might become a possibility ; guess what will happen to companies like UNH; they will disappear
LOVE IT WHEN UNH TANK BIG. THEY ALL THIEVES
"Just keep buying UNH, because I believe that the earnings number should beat the estimate, otherwise, UNH will not increase dividends and buy back stock."
Can't believe how lucky I got. Sold half of my positions yesterday only to buy back today $5 cheaper. Thanks demoncraps
Nice comeback for UNH. I was getting worried.
8.32 - pretty good earning each year - hold this forever
when Bernie idiot sanders spoke unh was at $249 --that's where we could close today but after earnings over $300
Bottomless
finally the junk tanked ...
JUNK. Stock only goes down lately
"there wont be medicare for ALL, those with great plans would never give them up (tell postal and union their healthcare is gone..) BUT all the rest, medicaid, those without coverage, would go to medicare...and this means two classes of people, those on government health and those with great plans.. ....seniors would be thrown under the bus as the numbers of doctors accepting government payment would shrink with hospitals cutting costs...it looks ugly."
Give it a couple days. A new big story will come up about another company and this will be back to $250 within a month.
"nice to see...A federal judge in California has ordered United Behavioral Health into court-monitored supervision after ruling the health insurance company improperly denied mental health treatment claims to thousands of patients, according to a federal, class-action lawsuit."
Democrats r crazy
"So, is this overdone or just the beginning?"
HEALTH CARE REFORM WILL CAUSE A $4 BILLION LOSS
Still looks cheap
Who is this clown with the USA moniker? Sounds like a 8 year old that just bought 1 share with his piggy bank money. Should be a great entry point and hope for a solid earnings report/guidance tomorrow morning. I’d be thrilled with $245 by the end of the week and $280 by the end of the year. GLTA
What happened to UNH. It was down so much. Bought back at 229. Looks like a big mistake
GUYS THE MARKET COULD DROP 200 TO 300 POINTS TODAY --UNH COULD DROP BACK TO $245-----GOING TO BE A BAD DAY IN MARKET
MM robbery from retail investors
What is going on? EU fines UNH or what? LOL. I step in to buy more now because I don't believe that UNH will down 4 points with Dow index downs only 100 points.
UnitedHealth reached an all time high at 313.28
52 week low is $215.82. We're there! This is a turning point. This is when the calvary jumps in.
Bernie Sanders - and the Dems worry about Trump being a Russian - Hope his dreams get flushed so that UNH flys again!
Classic...McDonald's and United Healthcare both hitting new highs.
any pullback soon lol?
"Like I keep saying, it's FOW.........fear of Warren.https://www.barrons.com/articles/unitedhealth-group-stock-is-falling-as-elizabeth-warrens-election-chances-are-rising-51569527200?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"Money does not go anywhere. Individual fools make hard earned money and give it to the analysts! A simple money movement from the loser to the gainer. Then the cycle is over. Once the bull market comes again, the cycle repeats! Anyone has opposite opinion? :-)"
"I was trying to account for the weakness in the HMO's and hospital stocks today and found this........Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the door on Tuesday to votes on a bill cutting federal spending and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget — efforts that face little prospect of passage but are aimed at mollifying fiscal conservatives outraged over rising deficits.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is working in tandem with the White House on a “recissions” package that would ax some of the spending from last month’s government funding bill. President Donald Trump has expressed frustration about domestic spending increases Democrats won in the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill.“Our Republican colleagues ought to walk the walk not just talk the talk. After a huge deficit on a tax bill, they want to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment?” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “That means one of two things — A: They’re not serious. B: They want to cut Medicare and Social Security. We will fight them tooth and nail on that.”.......................which is taken from an article at Politico.I think this is one reason the stock is languishing when it should be a safety trade stock with talk of tariffs. The Repubs are in a bind after passing the budget busting tax bill and may look to claw back some money from SS and Medicare."
"Just got a bill for some minor surgery my wife had. The bill was originally just over 2100.00 and there was an adjustment of 1600.00. In other words 590.00 is what United Health Care considered a reasonable charge for the procedure and united Health Care paid $72.00 on a 2100.00 bill. My wife and I pay over $14,000.00 in insurance premiums to United Health Care per year. united Health Care paid 72.00 on a 2100.00 bill. Quite a profit margin I'd say. Some people would call that getting ripped off."
"What is the better buy ? UNH or HUM. Yahoo has HUM as undervalued, while UNH is fair value ."
break-out continues...
I'm seeing a pattern of a couple of weeks before the dividend a stock tanks. And it tanks again after a stellar earnings report. What the ? The market is rigged.
"Real money will start buying around midday. imo, closes around 246."
Amy Klobuchar loves this company. Erika Zak. How many others.
"Great buying opportunity! Going higher! Whenever I feel like selling, I need to hold on - it always goes up afterwards. Patience will be rewarded!"
I wonder how the democratic debate tonight will affect this tomorrow
UNH will hit $300 soon $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ GTLT
"Glad it is up so I can get out. Look at graph, Everytime it goes up like this it's obvious what is next...don't have to be a fortune teller."
Another 52 week high today. $180 here we come!
Nice consolidation. Need that for the next move higher. Five year hold.
"So you are trying to convince us that because Bernie Sanders is looking less likely to be the Democratic candidate that a stock that is poised to get hammered with claims from the other thing that you are trying to tell me will sink the American economy, Corona Virus that all health insurers are reaching all time highs??? Firstly, it doesn't matter who the Democrats put up against Trump, he wins in a landslide unless what you are telling about Corona Virus really does happen, but it won't because all of the above are false narratives. The markets are rigged, end of story. Uber wealthy pulling the strings, must have had bought in after the health insurers dumped with Bernie so now they are pumping the stocks. Soon they will be dumping them."
Crazy Bernie will never make it to the white house. He is a socialist who wants to bankrupt USA through wacky Medicare for all.
Amazing how they dipped this just enough to close below the 10 sma by 6 cents lol. Why? Why? Because closing above the 10 sma after a huge selloff is bullish and triggers buy programs and algos. So the compete jack@$$$$ that manages this stock and its chart pattern did this. Scam
"Like I said this morning, up over 2.5% now. The cons took lots of gullible peoples money that sold the last week, lol. Back to 260 next week."
Blow out quarter ahead. 340 after earnings
"time to BUY this solid moneycow with a low PE, and projected great earnings not affected by trade wars.."
"*New* ALL TIME HIGH! Trump is really reigning in Big pharma and health insurers! Glad I voted for him! And glad that he has so many Goldman ""advisors""!"
How long before they fade it today?
Noise creates fear...fear creates buying opportunities.
"Yahoo, why is the major holders (20) missing for UNH? Insiders are OK, but no majors. Doing some research & analysis on health care equities."
Still massively under valued
-1.57% 15 mins into opening... I thought earnings report was good? What’s all the shorting about? Anyone know?
I worked for FHP in 1987 I started to buy at about 21.00 long story short after a number of acquisitions i ended up working for UNH I was able to retire very early thanks to UNH.
UnitedHealth reached an all time high at 345.23
what am i missing here ??? aren`t they in same industry or business as HUM ?
"They are definitely on a hiring spree in my county. I don’t see significant risk to holding this one or even JNJ, which I consider a bargain."
It seems the market makers can not hold this horse down today. I think every body expect that Jay Powell may not only hold the rate but he may hint that he will cut the rate in order to slow down the global slowdown that will hurt the US real bad.
Is this thing going to stop acting like a bum stock and go up today? I sure hope so!!
"ANTM almost high again but UNH is about 15% more to hit high. It is so funny that UNH which is about double size of ANTM, PE is about the same, Dividends higher, still has undervalue."
"Markets up, UNH down, markets down UNH down even more. This stock is dead"
What's happening?
$$300 let's go
"I guess that UNH will announce some big news within this week. I just wonder that Dec 15, call 220 is still there, with the premium over 4.50, which I guess something is coming. that is why I bought UNH call 220 too. It will move over 225 before Friday. Now i believe there is a setup which average traders or investors do not know."
"It is so funny, UNH is still down.I hope that the game will not extend too far. Watch out, China will use the consumer boycott against American companies. Trump will come out and cries foul. Under belt punch, it will be loud and be heard all over the world because he is the one to start."
keeps dropping like its #$%$
"Can’t tell you how many times I have seen it....call it Groundhog DayUNH reports bright and early, crushing just about every metric. $400 by May"
I'm buying into UNH...NO china exposure and a defensive play ......Sooner or later UNH will rally ....
UnitedHealth is up 10.82% to 289.69
How is this company not in the crosshairs of policy makers. UNH runs the Medicare and Medicaid insurance markets and they are the most profitable. Amazing
What we need is some good earnings tomorrow and a realization that medicare for all is a long ways away and that's if legislation could even pass it which is not probable.
The lower it goes the bigger the short squeeze will be once they crush earnings......
I dont know why anyone questions me daily...
All the money flows into HEALTH CARE. It is about to BREAK OUT the whole sector.
why surging after hours
"Wow. Some big buying going on right now. Watched it jump from 213 to 217 in what seems like a minute. Went to 220+ Gotta be a big institution, I assume. Exciting stuff to watch, despite the pain of losing so much this year."
Short Squeeze imminent...
"Almost all electronic platforms are blinking market crash coming. Now a days market is driven by this electronic platforms only, so take the profit and wait for it to drop to buy again"
Top and bottom line beats with an incremental raise. That shouldn't surprise anyone. But now what? The stock decline was never about the immediate future. It was about uncertainty over the Optum biz and the long term viability of HMO's..........for which there will be noise for years to come. Both political parties have healthcare in their cross hairs but with approaches effecting HMO's very differently. I suspect the next few years will be a bumpy ride.
It is a common sense that 04 pages report of 300 Pages Investigation does not conclude anything in terms of collusion or OOJ. It’s a fabrication by AG Barr a Trump appointee. Are you kidding us!!
UNH bailed from ACA insurance long ago but is still pulled down by a law suit in TX that might kill the ACA. See the press today.
UNH went up $4.50 the day a judge threw out one of the two cases by 18 states to cancel the Federal governments subsidies to insurance companies. Now that the second case was ruled on as Obama care payments to insurers doesn't have to be paid its up another $3 bucks. I guess the CVS deal has something to do with today's rise?
"XLV down 1.5%, IHF down 1.17%, UNH down 2.27%, HUM down 1.71%, ANTM down 2.91%, and the S&P was flat. I invite anyone to explain why a sector with reliably growing earnings would be down in a defensive market."
This one will tank tomorrow and the rest of the week as Joe Biden is cratering in the polls. My price target is 230 by end of week
"Under normal conditions I would say that UNH was oversold. but with Trumpy the Clown running things in WDC I think the trend will continue once we get into the new year. I see a small January effect and then down, a lot more down. Good government makes all the difference. I'm missing Obama right now."
What did they blow it on the call again?
"it is another magic trick that UNH pull out again. Davita or Healthcare Partner is huge in the West, takes all the medicare patients that is very lucrative business in the west. UNH just breaks ANTM's back in its own backyard."
Anthem is RED AH !!!
don't sell!
"Down again, this thing acts like it has a disease. It needs to see a doctor itself."
"The CEO of UNH said today that Bernie Sanders and so-called ""universal MediCare"" would be a disaster..."
this is disgusting
UNH is down -22& for just 5 days. Too early panicking and over-reaction. Bought more.
"This thing needs to see a doctor, total pc of junk."
I was a buyer today
"I have been holding shares since spring 2009 It’s been a great run I think that the fear of Democratic Party healthcare plans is overblown But that doesn’t mitigate the damage that fear itself can do I would wager that there are many people waiting to sell a pop on Tuesday I am beginning to suspect that UNH’s earnings won’t really matter What good is earnings growth in a moment when populist Dems are saying insurers are evil? The PBM has become a target.. of both the Dems and the Trump administration The Dems see the insurance side profits as a well from which they can fund universal free health care.... the notion is ridiculous but it doesn’t matter.. If a significant portion of the population buys in we will spent 2-4 years with fat political fingers probing the books, looking for money to confiscate... I wish it were otherwise and I have bought in as the shares have dropped, looking for any sort of bounce but this is feeling more like a deflation than a test"
I will really be telling everybody I know avoid Sanders n Warren and prob all femos
There she goes...
Yes ch3
Elective surgeries and procedures picking back up...double whammy rest of year. Then biden takes over....
This could be the worst stock in the market the last 4 days
"Healthcare stock that needs an examination of its own, because something is seriously wrong with it."
Wow this stock is hated so much. Up all day with Cigna although Cigna was up more than 2x percentage. Then this awful useless hated stock took another dump into the close. Down trend continues
"Easy money, blew past $225 like it was nothing. Sold my calls for a 12k profit"
I wonder if this is going down because boomers retiring. They will be on Medicare. They will not be buying from employer.
Dumb Joe or red Bernie.....hmm there is no intelligent life here.
UNH is up 8.00% to 253.26
I am in. This is cheap!
A heavy Correction is imminent!US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!The Valuations are impossible to justify! The US Stock indexes must fall by 65-70% to come down reasonable valuations.$UNH $BA
Anthem and BIIB earnings in the morning will take us over $235
Trader's are now taking full advantage of this.
"It is great to be part od this successful climb, just wish I had bought more."
"Long term, I would also add CVS Aetna at much reasonable under value price. You will be rewarded. ER is Wednesday"
Just get in Jan 2019 call option because I can't resist to pick up UNH when it is down 6-7 points.
This stock is broke right now. Take out behind the barn and shoot it.
close above 250 today...
At the bottom of the range. I'm on board. Undervalued.
"Value stock like UNH still hold it today, it is very impressive. I thought it goes down to the toilet today."
"The market makers force the weak hand out today. Money flows out of health care to high tech today. But I think at the end, traders will come back into health care,particularly UNH, because it is a safe bet tomorrow."
does anyone know when that damn medicare for all bill be voted on?
I’m a centrist Democrat hated trump. This proposals like Medicare for all & free higher education are mind boggling bc life doesn’t work that way. Why don’t all Americans just not work & get paid for every life’s necessities & desire. America & capitalism have always existed side by side like identical twin. To take one away is to destroy our founding fathers dream & goal. It’s not even about parties; it’s a proposal to destroy Americans culture & dreams.
Going to be interesting to see what happens with the VP selection.
"Health care sector is safe today. It is so scare that the tech sector got hit. FB is down over 7 points, but I believe it will come back. I still hold UNH, because I have confidence that earnings will beat estimate, because the company gives me the clue by increasing dividends 20% and raise the guidance.."
Run shorts... Run...
This market is fixed. Only way to explain this price behavior for a large DOW stock.
Probably a glitch
"Insiders are buying MILLIONS and millions of dollars worth, you know it's gonna go up. Give it time, this will be like a Phoenix."
UNH is up 4.91% to 267.48
UNH has lots of things going and ready to hit the roof in no time. So watch out before you short and get burnt alive
"I thought UNH would have strong growth. What do you think is holding it down lately? Fear of Feds? I really cant see Amazon et al being a near term threat, do you? Something else?"
This morning I sold off the extra shares I bought Monday for $286 .. for $295
Over $265 by 97/17
So... what’s the diff between unh being at 270 and 261? Like... it’s still a low pe.... damn these traders following aimlessly
"I just love a good manipulation by the market around TK. lol, don't sell your shares to the computers that trade with each other."
25PE ... it has to crash imho regardless what price now
"Up 13% between the last trading day of 2017 and last trading day of 2018, not bad at all considering market conditions. Early in the year I'll be able to put more into my Roth and let it grow tax-free."
We'll be testing the January lows soon. 220 here we come.
All metrics were good with upbeat guidance..how does this translate to a plummeting stock price?
Why is this down for no reason? Am i missing any news?
"Just live off the dividend as Bernie sticks to UNH and overcharging drug companies, doctors and annoying lawyers?"
"Been a while since I have written but things are starting to look up. Have now built large position in UNH and have cost basis at about 240, so I am dead even at this point. I think this is still a wonderful opportunity and kick myself for not buying more at 210. UNH is best of breed in the HMO space. I have 30 years of experience as a physician and investor and I challenge anyone on this board to challenge me that UNH is not the best HMO. (Speaking as an investor, not as a patient or doctor). No other company does a better job managing care or costs. Period.HMO space has been unfairly punished by the medicare for all BS. Not going to happen. NO WAY. Even most dems shy away from the issue and it won't get past the current House. Political pressure now on Big Pharma, that's good for insurance cos.UNH has blown out earnings and revenue numbers on a consistent basis and raised guidance for 2019. Don't know what anyone else wants. Stock should be at 300 by year end and outperform the major indexes. Challenge anyone to disagree. Would love to hear other opinions and potential pitfalls going forward"
Look at the UNH chart over the last 10 years. There has not been a drop like this in 10 years or ever. This is either going to 0 or the best buying opportunity in HC services ever.
"ACA resolution will help the sector.Ana Gupte, senior health-care services analyst at Leerink Partners, said the health-care sell-off is mostly driven by the proposed legislative changes to the PBMs’ business model, which are paid so-called rebates by Big Pharma for getting their drugs covered by private and public insurance plans, like Medicare. These so-called backdoor deals are suspected by lawmakers of increasing drug costs for patients.It is “very likely” lawmakers force drug companies to give those rebates to consumers instead, starting as early as next year, Gupte said.Separately, a federal appeals court in New Orleans said Wednesday that it will hear arguments in July on a lawsuit backed by President Donald Trump to overturn Obamacare. Dismantling the health-care law would lead to 32 million more uninsured people in the U.S. by 2026, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office."
Made a killing on my puts today
Bernie and socialism are now history...
"Earning: 3.90 vs 3.78Revenue: shy of estimateAffirm EPS for the year...Overall, it's good earning...UNH should go higher..."
"Well UNH is barely down today, much better than my CVS stock. I'm holding this until at least 4/16 ER. I think it will go back over $260 after 4/16."
Another bad close already. Down she goes
Healthcare getting hammered today. Could just be news that has yet to hit the street or this whole thing could just be over done. Depends on your investing style I would say that when there's blood in the street... buy buy buy. One caution being that if some news does drop it would dramatically change the outlook on healthcare in the near term so play your hand carefully.
Trump won’t stop here
UNH -is overvalued IMHO
let's try to close above 250 today...
It is concerning Medicare for all supposed to eliminate all private healthcare providers. stock also is challenged on a technical chart considering that it just formed a death cross. despite all that I will never sell a stock on the RSI of 35 and then once you sell it we'll start going up because all sellers have sold their shares and buyers are stepping in
Damage Inc.
Sell now before Bernie wins Iowa.
On Sale! Git you sum.
it will close this friday at $260!! The swamp is live and well!
any news? why popping with big volume?
Buy lots more this stock will be going up Hugh from here
"Not funny, was up quite a bit and is gonna close negative. WTH"
Down 6 in a row with no buyers
sell the rally.
Since August 2015: UNH $126 to $336 UP $210 per share CVS $113 to $58 DOWN $55 per share NEWT LOSS FOR NOT LISTENING TO THE GREAT CLONE $265 per share
LOOK FOE A RETRACEMENT TO $175 --MAY SEE A $10 DROP TODAY
I bet the analysts come out with buy reiterations after the call.
All Goldman all naked all fraudulent all criminal
Would you traders please understand that Medicare for all is a unicorn. It won’t happen. Ever. So stop acting like UNH is going under. Good grief.
does this stock have any exposure to Trade wars?
Medicare for all will not happen Bernie and Elizabeth is proposing this to win the election it’s not in their heart so that’s not good.
It’s going to 243.50
UNH continues falling tmr! It’s bc it was priced in too much high expectation right before the earning report!
Elizebeth Warren pens you clowns lol
this is why invest in chunks and add when opportunities present themselves; has the business changed? Medicare changes would be years away if even possible. I'll be adding.
"EBITDA $20B.... And yet, it takes two months for me, a UnitedHealth Inc. (client/patient, ya know the one who makes you that profit!), two months to get a $25 part fixed on my wheelchair. Capitalism unchecked will implode."

On sale today!
270 first then 280 after earning
OptimumRx was the pbm for Cigna and it is now transitioning away from Unh because express scripts was bought out by Cigna. Big loss for Unh.
Whoever is responsible for changing that one-year target is getting a workout this week.
Hey Eric! How's it feel to have to pay the dividends on the shares you borrowed and sold? lol

"Surprisingly, big boys do not show up yet."
max pain is $242.50. Will they get there?
Well it looks like the market has decided elizebeth warren is going to win the democrat nomination and then win the presidency and then easily pass Medicare for all and put all hmos out of business. That’s what the market is acting like
"News flash - this is ABSOLUTELY NOT a highly shorted stock; there will be no short squeeze here. In fact, with a short ratio around 1, you could say there are effectively no short positions out there. It is something I look at before buying or selling."
Falling knife anyone?
Doing research on new stocks is getting so hard. That’s why I joined up with this free service that sends one solid stock pick every single week. So far the picks have been great. Just go to https://stockdorkalerts.blogspot.com/ to learn more. .
Downgrade based on view that Medicare Advantage enrollment will decline... WHA? The crest of the baby boom is just peaking. People don't leave medicare unless they die. Baby boomers are living longer than any other prior generation. Simple demographic analysis tells you that medicare advantage programs will continue to grow which is why many of us are here to begin with. Healthcare IS a growth industry and is pretty much recession proof. This report is pure BS.
Might take a nibble if it breaks then holds 250.25
What is going on?Can't be just AMZN...
"I like to buy more of UNH because it wants to cut cost and traders run from it. It is so funny UNH will report the record earnings again next month, I guess UNH will test new high before earnings report."
UNH is down -5.86% to 232.90
I think one unimpressed fund with big money wanted to get out but by doing that it triggered a bunch of stops—buy this dip guys. Scarred money dont make money
Ok do we get a bounce?
"had this on my radar this morning. unfortunately merrill lynch site was hosed, no trading possible."

aetna is great!
tax cut is taking away one big tool to fight recession in the future. chicken blood
just following general healthcare for day. Baselining for earnings in 2 weeks and then to $320.
"If someone wants Medicare for All, can I give them mine?"
I think with aging baby-boomers and AARP support this is a good stock to hold not trade
"Down $10 in 5 days, what gives?"
"Davita is very strong today, beats estimate, so it should help UNH today."
$236 today?
"Oh look, it can do something besides go down. I was beginning to wonder..."
"If you cannot stop the bleeding the victim dies, same applies for a business. Such potential and disappointment."
look at her rising to all time high!Go UNH!!!
"Is the ranger guy stopped already he’s been ranting for 3 weeks now everyday he is like a insane, crazy and wild. None stop ranting my goodness I never did that kind of ranting. He even predicted the Market today and he’s on point."
"As long as folks like Warren and Sanders are still theoretically a possibility, I don't see this coming back until after the election. I only have a token investment at this point."
Dividends being reinvested today! Yay!
Blowout earnings this will pop tomorrow guaranteed
"when will I learn? I have a 94% success rate on my daily trades, making $400-$500 day on small trades. But nearly 100% failure every time I swing for the fences on a big trade."
Wow its still going down on a big up day in the market!
Lol that was pathetic. Better to just be down 10.00 than to be up .50 on andow up 275 day. Seriously this stock is useless
"Oh wow, this loser stock is up on a red day, can't believe it."
"Not oversold by any means. Buying Op? Sure as long as your time horizon is very long, or near term with an eye on a few percentage points gain (I fit in the latter). Buy here and sell in the 245-250's range. In other words, buy the dip, sell the rally. I am in for a dollar cost average of 239. One day rallies are not rallies. Wait for a three day rally and sell. Still a bear market overall. An it's not the democrats that are pushing it down, it's both parties with an eye on reducing drug costs (an election issue for Cheatin Don as well as the dems.) OptumRx is the achilles heel here."
Sell the rally...
i see usa is the man on this board
"Guest on cnbc this morning says time to BUY healthcare again at these levels as this cycle comes around with the medicare for all rhetoric. This rhetoric has been going on for many years, bernie isn't the first...and obviously the bill never passes. Just offers buying opportunities."
Demetrios the only hater here haha bruh people don’t even know this stock
"Earnings: $ 3,90 vs expected $ 3,78"
"Ori karev.ex ceo.joins precipio.cancer testing.prpo,has record volume 10 days in a row"
"The stock itself goes down to the toilet, but surprisingly the option premium is so expensive. I don't know why, anybody can explain."
"They beat the numbers, raised outlook, but down $5"
"UNH is a great company, true....But, all the healthcare companies have a target on their backs....The politics is only going to get uglier as the Democrats run for the Presidency...And, they're all running to the left as fast as they can...So, good luck to everybody who dares to invest in this industry..."
This stock is totally dead and useless. Let’s just be honest with yourself and admit you are parked in a stock that is losing you money compared to the market
It took weeks to get this positive and after ex- dividend it takes one day return to ruins.
Absolutely no buy interest all day. Whoever is liquidating was selling relentlessly that’s why here never was any upMove. Not sure why he needs to sell but I guess he needs to save his Chinese exposed stocks or he is just getting redemptions. Silliness
this stock sucks...it was over $10.. now $8+ ..
"If trump lowers tax rate to 25% UNH will have extra cash and better earnings, I think they will increase the dividend by 30 % a year and earnings should grow at over 20% a year for at least the next 14 years as baby boomers hit peak retirement in 2030"
And down she goes. Hope you sold the rally this morning if you needed a chance to get out. Waiting for an entry point.
Someone tell this company they are going to lose so much money over the virus
Totally dead
UNH is up 6.58% to 239.85
"275+ first thing on Thursday morning. I have no doubt. If UNH hits 275 tomorrow, all profit will go to CI."
"The market makers accumulates UNH for some one. The shorts put does not have premium, that means no one goes against UNH, but call options premium is way too pricy. I will wait till the close, so I don't get punished much in case any thing goes wrong."
Yesterday bottomed at 208 and reversed up to closing 216 on BIG volume. Today a good follow-through day closing up +2.26% to +221.75. Tonight ALL of cnbc fastmoney traders put a BUY on UNH based earnings and increased profit guidance and way oversold on BS rhetoric that won't happen.
Weak close and market has spent a lot of up move already. Unless the Dow can go up another 200-300 Monday (more likely to be down) then UNH without a big up day will gap down and head to 225 or 220. Stock is hated. Although Elizebeth Warren can’t even beat Biden unless Biden drops out. Anyway this stock is headed to 225 Monday
"It was shaping up to a a good day in the market until Stumpy threw a tantrum, took his ball and went home. The S&P and Dow are tanking, dragging everything down with it. Let's see if UNH can hold onto a gain."
"Out UNH at $297.98 for an EXCELLENT gain of $3.4k. Another very successful Pure Earnings play, this one worked out almost exactly as I had hoped/planned/anticipated. :-) Now, gonna Short AA and go Long WNS. Split the baby in half and see what happens. :-) Best of Luck to All! :-)"
Another 52 week high today!
"I got his warning on Friday which I think it is unprofessional, because he knew that downgrade is coming. So, i bought it today. But I still don't like him, he knew that the stock itself is no-brainer stock. That is why I never subscribe Thestreet."
This stock is so broken. See you at 225
Buy the dip.....and lose all of your money.
"This market is looking for any reason to sell off. Melt Ups always end badly for longs. UNH will react badly given the overnight news of escalation of hostilities in Iraq. Nothing to do with fundamentals, just that it's had a good run and there will be profit taking. Sell now!"
This is insane. Computers or idiots selling at 52 weeks lows after good earnings?
"CNBC half time. Intel is a great buy here, It is going to kill it when the new CEO comes on board."
"I think that one must consider the impact of UNH’s status as a bellweather for the sector when measuring it’s odds of moving up/down and the degree of that movement.. As close as I can tell, many health sector etf’s and the various index funds hold Unh rather Hum, Antm or CVS.. UNH has become, in effect, a proxy for the whole sector. So, when the skies are bright and the sector is nicely making way Unh outpaces the group.. but, on the other hand, when skies are cloudy and/or when any part or parcel within the wider healthcare sector runs aground.. UNH becomes the whipping boy How does one account for the volatility, the positive and negative repercussions of being the recognized leader in a sector so diverse? That is the question"
Brought calls going into earning
think this hits 300 on earnings
"""Can you take me higher?To the place where blind men seeCan you take me higher?To the place with golden streets"""
This stock is total trash people. Th would need a 9.00 gain to be back to Friday mornings open lol
See you at 250 soon
Unusual volume of trades in Pre-Market portends a Gap Up Open this morning...
don't forget it's Fourth of July holiday week and summertime which always historically proves lower volume. sell in may go away has a reason of support supporting it. I'm still extremely optimistic for this to shoot up the 280 plus by years in if not sooner.
It could have broken 300 but there werr no buyers above 296. He tried to leave it that day he opened it at 300 and there were no buyers
UNH Takes one Month to Refund your Payment...Why so long ?
Will be back to 300 this week...
Think we are oversold at this point? Wow...
"This is like a well that keeps on going down. Staying in long because once they find out the real costs, they'll backtrack to another idea."
Next tuesday after the election this stock will drop to 230
"Tuesday is coming folks!! If UNH reports good numbers ALL the HMO's will move higher CI, HUM, ANTM etc......."
"Anyone worried about the demoncraps should get out of the stock market entirely. Save for Beto, everyone else is bad for the market. They want to kill big tech, banks, health insurers, pharma, and just about any company that's public and profitable. They'll keep reimbursing $TSLA and burn more taxpayers' money."
Do you think UNH will cross 375 after earning in Jan 2021?
"All the giant discount stores are in good shape. WMT, COST, TGT are in green. it is so funny that health care sector is supposed to be in green today, does not participate with the retail."
"Muting ERIC, suggest you do the same... no redeeming value whatsoever."
Well run company....continually beats street for years now. Usually raises guidance. Only 17 times earnings.... (very low). In with the longs!!!!!
Cannot believe I sold at 204. Damm
"Ya'll don't get it! If people are fearful of death from Coronavirus, they will ensure their life, right? That's equal to more profit from UNH if they will no gonna die. So we can expect more earning in the next call. Don't you think so?"
I thought dems gonna drag this down?? What happen?
Looking like a top here. Night rested 295-296 one more time to kill options
"No bounces or support, just straight down all day. Not sure who is selling at these prices that didnt already sell on the last downturn."
Wish I had paid attention to this today. Expecting upward movement in the following weeks
BLOW - OUT EARNINGS GUIYS WEE $300 FRIDAY
what am I missing? why did it drop by 2.38%?
UNH needs a republican to win so this democratic Medicare for all nonsense comes to an end and all insurance stocks can begin to go up
This stock could easily trade under 150.
"and as usual, nobody will go after Ilhan Omar about voting fraud and ballot harvesting. This will go away just like her marriage to he brother disappeared from public view. SAD."
I'd be a buyer at 240.
"I have a sizable position (for me) in UNH built in the $100-$150 per share range. I'm thinking this downturn is only the beginning of a deterioration in healthcare stocks that will continue through the upcoming election and possibly beyond. I am not a Dem but I believe the ""Medicare for all"" stance some of the Dems are pushing will, at a minimum, generate extensive debate re the state of US healthcare. Almost all legitimate research shows that US Healthcare costs far more per capita than services provided in other industrialized countries and delivers relatively poor results. The healthcare industry including many physicians does everything possible to obscure the true costs of providing these services. I can't believe this situation is going to stand up well under a full debate. I am considering pulling the plug on all/most of my healthcare related stocks for these reasons. Anyone else as worried as I am."
"Monthly payments increased by more than $150 after ""obozocare"". Less coverage too. Thanks obozo!"
"50% haircut a comin, this baby is going down"
"The congress woman who is proposing this bill has no clue about the cost and who is going to pay for it. But, making so much of noise and such thing will never fly in House itself, forget the senate. But, the folks with sheep mentality dumping shares of best run companies like UNH. It is way oversold ... this should have been $275 plus stock. With UNH even DOW & market going down since last couple of days. Politicians are bunch of jokers ... but causing too much panic for sure. .. their bark is worst than bite."

"What a pump fake this morning, very frustrating."
High for the day is in on as usual. 231.68 that’s your high for the day as it’s already lost .85. I wouldn’t at all be surprised if this closed red
Don’t be a hero and buy here. Only sadness will come your way.
I thought it was going to take awhile to get here.
"This stock is a short. I've had the unfortunate experience of of being a policy subscriber for a year. No matter how many times I try to use their website to pay the premium, there's something wrong with my login. They feel like they should tell me to change it. And, then it still doesn't work. When I finally called someone she said she deals with policy holders all day who can't sign in. I'm not the only one. I'm going to a company that runs a real website. UHC are incompetent amateurs and the competition is going to eat their lunch."
Going lower. Much lower. Just no support and no bounce. A stock that is this weak is going lower. I mean much much lower
"The reality of what the future holds is buried beneath the report and the changing dynamics in America. No one any longer wants these parasites feeding off healthcare while providing nothing more than processing claims. No one is more fed up than the employer base who has been ripped off for years. UHN will survive selling Advantage plans into the public option, but their forecasts will become a bad dream."
this bodes well for cvs earnings i would imagine
"talking heads know nothing,,,,,to lessen the mandates on policies wont hurt UHC,,,it helps.... think about it,,,,now 25 year old single MEN wont have to pay for OBGYN care or other ""ad-ons"" that are now required.....therefore, more customers buying a product they want and need,,,,, not an overpriced mandated policy with products they don't want or need..."
now this could get interesting at 3% dividend yield A HIGH QUALITY ST0CK

"Just weed the weaker hands out. Now it is time for the market makers working to suppress the price down and at the end of the day, hand all the shares to the big boys. I observe the money relocation since the beginning of the month, MFI is coming to the health care sector, this is the reason UNH is still sit near the high. The good news is there is a lot of consolidation within the sector, such as CVS, WELL, HUM. Who ever holds UNH should not have to worry about it. Right now just sit tight, pick up dividends and wait for the stock going up itself. UNH has the great management team, knowing how to do capital management, leverage the cash flow."
Not very often you see the same thing almost everyday. Open up big and then sell off.
2% bump today on the FTC approval of DaVita deal?

Lol dow up another 170 and you guessed it terd down another 1.50 lol. Wait when the dow actually reverses and goes down then this stock will be at 235
I am extremely mortified and dismayed how UNH would not cover my dental X-Ray ..Because they claim that my dentist was not in their net...I should have only been billed for the 5 minute dental evaluation and not billed for the X-Ray.
UNH reached a 52 Week low at 198.18
UNH reached an all time high at 290.85
What is with all of these nonsense spam posts in here?
I assume this selloff is due to the pending ACA vote?
after earning do you think it should be sold or held?
Pre-earnings announcement run up now happening.
Down on an Up day... Here we go again.
"April 18, $250 strike calls have open interest of 2,677. The money is on the market reacting to a good report and strong guidance."
"smart move, investing in Optum. Obviously the area of growth and with the ACA secure, a definite win for UNH."
This is going to 220 now that we will find thousands of infections!!! Every other country is ahead of us. Trump said everything was done perfectly. This is the worst president ever.
health care bill will now fail so unh will jump 10-18% here
Not a one or two day fluke. Humana is superior stock
SInce UNH pulled out of OBAMA CARE it will NOT GET ANY of the BENEFITS now that OBAMACARE is HERE TO STAY !
Here’s a tip mute USA spam. Anyways I’m a buyer sector got hit hard let’s see what the earnings say
"#$%$ price move, although good earnings"
Humana on fire up another 3.60. Poor week UNH up .95 lol. Only a moron would own this after this performance
Please read ! Clearly Bernie the dinosaur & AOC are seriously delusional.
"Unbelievable. Straight up into the close, on one of the worst weeks of the year? On a Friday??? Okay, I'm a believer, I guess. This is not normal at all."
Demos
Ex-Dividend tomorrow. Bears driving away the scary cats to get in on the dividend. It will come back in the long run.
"This week UNH should be the top trade stock. I think UNH will rise up to 280 on Thursday even though the market is overbought. Most of the hedge funds have UNH in port. Big boys keep pushing the envelop, predict S&P to 3500 by year end. Just buy UNH when it is in deep red."
Just look at the 5 year chart on UNH...
My take........recall all the HMO companies beat expectations last quarter but kept full year guidance unchanged because they expected expenses to increase in the subsequent quarter once patients started to go see their doctors again as COVID declined. I think the stocks are selling off due to this effect. It would explain the across the board weakness. I haven't seen any analyst downgrades or downward revisions of earnings. I've been nibbling on UNH below $307. I could see the stock dropping to $300ish but coming back as the next quarterly report approaches.
All this because of pochantas lol. Seriously there are fund managers that honestly think Pocahontas Warren will win. She is a fraud and a kook. She lied that she was an Indian and she is as white as snow. Lol. And she has a plan for everything but they are socialist plans and people just don’t like her. Trump will take her apart
KEEP GOING DOWN MORE MORE MORE
"Stumpy going on the stump at a rally today after trashing the markets with a tweet. Way Stumpy, Way! Will he be bragging about the Stock Market? lol"
"The shift came after Mr. Witty signaled to the board that he was considering leaving, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Witty, who served on the UnitedHealth board before joining the company as an executive, is well-regarded by the board, which didn’t want to lose him, according to these people.Mr. Wichmann stepped down voluntarily, these people said."
"I bought call 270 and call 275. I believe that UNH will hit 275 by Thursday morning, and go up all the way to 280."
"This company is solid, wouldn't think of selling. This is just a speedbump."
"UNH is no brainer stock, one of the best in Dow 30. If BA does not screw itself up,Dow should be new high again. I predict that UNH will be above 300 in the next two years."
Getting shellacked with the rest of the group over more cases/hospitalizations from COVID. And because if the Dems take the WH and Senate drug prices will be in focus and there will be uncertainty about the future of managed care.
"I might pick some up when I think it has reached bottom (Boeing too). In what world does Medicare for all mean UNH does not make money? It means,on fact, that all the now uninsured will. become insured. UNH and others will explode with new customers. Personal taxes will go up for all Americans but UNH will not see downward pressure; quite the opposite. NEVER EVER underestimate the stupidity of large hedge fund mana gers currently off UMH. I make my living off their ignorance. God bless them."
.@SecAzar and I will soon release a plan to let Florida and other States import prescription drugs that are MUCH CHEAPER than what we have now! Hard-working Americans don’t deserve to pay such high prices for the drugs they need. We are fighting DAILY to make sure this HAPPENS...
"UNH been ""Berned""..it will NOT be ""Bidden"". but thanks for the buying opportunity. Obama's not even going to give him full support. From Business insider Headline: ""Former President Barack Obama expressed support for Joe Biden in his 2020 presidential run, but stopped short of a full endorsement."" We already have ACA...he hasn't expressed support for Bernie's gig."
Do you guys feel the burn yet lol
let the chatter take us back above 245 and watch the wip saw higher
"Earlier this year, UNH threatened to pull out of some ACA states during the congressional debate of ACA. Too much politics. Now it is a payback. Strangely, Trump did not reward the insurers. Seems no sympathy to insurers. Are insurers too greedy?"
"There will be more of this until we finally get single payer. Health insurers are just money changers - taking 20% off the top and doing nothing for it. It's gotten so expensive for ""real"" companies that self insurance saves big money. Add in all the money saved from actually controlling costs (i.e. deny unnecessary tests), and you have a winner."
All of the early morning gains are reversed (same for CVS) and it's heading southI don't understand why there is so much fear as no legislation affecting this group is going to pass
Rejected at the 50 dma. Not a good sign technically. IMO this must be due to uncertainty about the 2020 election and which Dem candidate will run against the Orange Fraud. We aren't talking about a minor trimming of EPS if someone like Warren were to win. We're talking about annihilation of the biz model.
unh going up $10% ore before earnings --after earnings going to $300
Holy cow
I PREDICT MASS SUICIDE AMONG UNH HOLDERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
UNH reached a new All Time High at 238.29
may be down or no movement for few weeks
inches away from crossing $400
Look at the number of UNH this morning. UNH is really cheap at even 260.
According to Bernie you need to close every major company and you need to take money from every rich person .. and give it to every bum ... free house free car free education free healthcare.. everything free you should be closing the stock market and give the money to every person in the street if he's going to be president it's going to be the end of this country so they would be no country no stock market nothing to be worried about.. and every money you lose on this stock Bernie will take from Jeff Bezos and give it to you..
like I said earler--- unh will close between $240 to $250 today
"I guess Crammer knew ahead in advance that the City bank will downgrade UNH, that is why he did not buy it until 261 then he will buy it. He got what he wants."
This stock is lifeless. Dead. Nothing can move it.
UNH will continue to suffer until the idea of healthcare for all is killed off. That won't happen until the Democrats pick a middle of the road candidate for President who will not pursue a cold transfer to some kind of government run program that kills off all the healthcare insurance companies and related entities.

It is about the right price I want to buy now because I believe that UNH has nothing to do with China.
Going DOWN!
"As I have been saying, Sell ANY rally. About to go red after being up a bit this morning... temporarily. Buy in at 240."
Same dipquat
Future headlines from debates big boys getting out now
"UNH will be the king of the health care. OPTUM is the growth engine to beat the earnings estimate again. At this price, its PE is around 20, but the earnings growth rate is over 20%. So I guess a lot of money flow will flow in to the value stock like UNH."
"As a Democrat, if Bernie wins the primary, I'll be forced to vote Trump."
"This morning, the price targets were cut by 3 companies. JP Morgan from 301 to 235, Suntrust from 330 to 300, Raymond James from 310 to 265.It will be bullish if we close up today on these downgrades."
People who had puts the last few days have absolutely gotten fisted on UNH.
These idiots are NOT thinking of fixing what is not working; instead break everything and create something else. What a BS argument from idiot Democrat house members.
Stock value should be $210 per share
"Clinton comes out against Bernie, leaving Warren the favorite of the liberal wing of the democratic party. Warren's stock just went up along with Medicare for All and UNH is likely to fall as a consequence!"
"Today is the day when ""CVS REAL STRENGTH"" will be observed-Will be see another HEAD FAKE?"
"Just going to wait until the chart says to buy....in this kind of market you either eat or, starve...Putting money into software, semiconductors and niche tech....Not much out there where the risk isn't a killer....I'll just have to be ready to sell when my favored groups start to tank..."
wait for 240
Get in before the 6 percent pop
Why the drop today?
Just relax and buy more my long friends... ur buying amazing discount lol
"UNH has consistently beat, with the dems looking like fools today, UNH will climb back in next few weeks as the circus winds down"
"Very low volume today with a 1% drop. Not too many people selling at this price so I say time to buy more over next 2-3 days if drops further, has some support at $290. I am surprised UNH failed after ER and Analysts Upgrades we did not get over $315....and I still beleive $330 very possible soon. The Executive Order on drug prices should not have impacted UNH to this level.....unless investors are reading this move as a attack on Insurance Companies to limit profits. Again the volume is low and it is a foolish reaction to sell at this time by retail investors scared out by the MM."
I have their Advantage Health Plan which they blatantly misrepresented. Now I know why they make so much money because they exploit the elderly.
"Revenue miss, down to 270"
"UNH is three times bigger ANTM, dividends yield is about 1/2 points. The earnings growth rate the PEG of UNH is better than any company in health care sector. The bigger gets better, so that is to be safe to buy UNH both long term and short term."
Why this stock is getting hit without any Solid reason? Looks like Market is getting manipulated and requires some serious investigation for dragging this stock. This is the BEST healthcare stock in the market.
"Elizabeth Warren has backed away from ""medicare for all"". Now, she's just looking at medicare for any that want to vote for her and that don't want to work with private insurers......that's the reason for the move in the stock price of UNH today.Since the democrats are now backing away from the notion of universality, based upon an inability to make the math work, UNH looks to be quite nicely priced on a valuation basis, considering where the market has moved in the last year and based upon UNH still selling quite below the 52 week high."
"Options show up or down 4.3%~~$11,00"
going red...
Hello UNH Mgmt - Be confident. Do a buy back. Increase the dividend. Hellllooooowwwww!
"The last few years the dividend increase was approved about now, payable in June. Is an extra 20% on the horizon?"
Crammer warns that the market will go down this week. He also said that S&P may pull back to 2700. I hope he is wrong.
"Really, really really ! Bernie the socialist is gonna be our president? Not a chance !!!"
UNH on Sale again... get you some.
Ditto - no news anywhere that I can find. The journalists must be asleep.
Can't have enough of UNH. One of my largest blue chip positions.
"Rumor of buying Tenet Healthcare division, THC for $2billion makes $36 billion annually"
I added today at $194.95
I wonder if we'll hold 300 into the weekend. This has been a stressful week. I miss the slow but steady UNH of past years.
20 x eps? No one is scared of healthcare changes unless we see the stock trading 10 x eps.
So many weak hands on this board makes reading very entertaining.
Stupid UNH
Reminder that this has still TRIPLED in five years even after the pullback. I’m just pointing this out for perspective and for those who want to buy just because “it’s already dropped so much”. Of course it might rise from here but worth noting.
"Jim ""Pump & Dump"" Cramer is as corrupt as he is bald."
Eric you need to chill ! It’s gonna trade sideway for a while. Volume is less than 2 mls bc its the same pos shorty who’s been in & out for sometimes.
"Is there any news about the CHNG purchase? The latter's stock price has been dropping for weeks, signaling that the deal may not happen."
They don't pay doctors or hospitals. They don't cover patient's prescriptions. This is how they make money. Can't last for ever
Here's to hoping we don't get kicked in the teeth for a third day in a row.
"Looks like good news not working, it’s all about Market makers"
With a dividend yield over 1.9% I took a chance we are near a low and bought some for long term.
All the health insurers are down today. HUM down $7.40. Anybody know why?
Was that bubble? Or it’s gonna turn back to around 275?
Wow I had no idea that unh was a business importing and exporting products from and to China hat would be exposed to tariffs and forex rates. This market is ignorant
"you guy's crack me up. You honestly think R's and D's matter? BhwaaThis country's been on a leftward lurch since the 30's. Every large country has single payer, we'll have it to. It's the way the rothschildren want it....."
Still bullish long term and bought more today at 215.15
"Did you sell the rally yesterday? If not, SUCKS TO BE YOU."
are you long on UNH? thumbs up yes thumbs down no
New 52 week high today.. Yes $170 soon
Most insane value!!
you can't trust anyone analysts these days everything I read UNH was a strong buy at 144
UNH is heading to $300 now!
neeeeeed this to stay above 400
"Why wouldn't UNH be running a Class Action Lawsuit vs the Sacklers, owners of Opioid Crisis?Why SHOULD UNH investors be on the Hook for that?While Sacklers hide billions...Sacklers Withdrew Nearly $11 Billion From Purdue As Opioid Crisis Mounted. Tufts University stripped the Sackler name from several of its buildings and divisions earlier this month, citing the billionaire family's role in the opioid crisisDirty Congress - greasing the skids"

FARCE POP..SHORT IT AT $266!!!!!!!!!!
I TOLD YOU SO. WHO IS YOUR DADDY?
UNH is down 7.35% to 203.65
I'm glad I got out @ 251 down 7 points already. Get out of UNH while yo Un can
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
967k shares traded form 3:59pm-4:00pm last friday on an uptick
I added today down $3. I think we push past $230 after earnings!
"I don't expect this to finish green today. That would be too easy and too comforting to us healthcare investors....nope, today will be some mediocre -.5%"
Who sold yesterday? How do you feel now?
"REALITY CHECK. Elizabeth Warren in not electable. Trump will destroy her in a landslide. Senate going to stay Red regardless. Worst case medicare for all, simply no government infrastructure to support 300 million insured. UNH would get contracts similar to current Medicare advantage.(Some of their most profitable business). Show me another company with YOY growth, rising dividend, increased EPS projections, and consistent quarterly beats that is now down more than 20pct off highs."
2020 Bernie president!!
UNH- doubt any good news! Over hyped today
"You are going the wrong way dweeb, whats the news?"
"With APPL to split 4:1, I think UNH may split soon..."
What happened?
Im confused if im selling now or just keep holding hahaha
Close at 235?
Big applause to sellers. Congratulations!!!
How can UNH have a beta of 1 and be down when the market is up over 200pts. It just doesn't make sense..
Let’s goooooooooooooo
What a clown.https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-punts-gop-unveil-healthcare-plan-right-after-election
It'll be $215 in 2 weeks.
UNH reached a new 52 Week High at $280.94
Timberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
this is ridiculous
Anyone that doesn't believe a medicare for all bill is realistic for our country right now should be a buyer here.

"more people employed, higher membership...UNH may test 310 today..."
"Buy at 220pm and sell at 240pm, that would have made a nice play :)"
"And how about that $280,000 student loan too. Uncle Sam can pay for it too"
UNH is down 4.92% to 264.13
check out product gbsn has
"Is the conference call choppy for anyone else? I just ran a speed test and I'm running 240mbps through comcast and my new computer is a beast, so I don't know what it causing the issue."
"Interesting analyst/chartist of CNBC said that Healthcare sells off when the markets has lower risk and is up during higher risk. In addition to the political drama, this appears to be a rotation out of lower risk (health care, staples), into growth and emerging markets. If this is true, buy health care services now as a hedge for when the economy cools again. The market right now seems like it is in melt up mode."
Who sold today at 215.20?! Sucks to be you!
ItWas up for a few minutes lol I blinked and it had lost 1.50 in 2 minutes lol. Junk junk junk junk
"Stay away from stocks that relate to China trade, because it can swing wildly when Trump tweets. Stick with health care, which is still going well at this moment."
Common sense makes me place some bet on UNH when it is red today. 2 points is too much because I believe that UNH is still undervalue. It is up only 10 points this week.
It’s hard for individual investors when quality stock gets hammered despite good earnings
Wonderful trend since March. Once we break $360 we will settle end of year in $380s.....i put the milk and cookies by the fireplace already
No buyers at any price level because no one wants to catch a falling knife
Antitrust? 7.8 billion spend to get bigger. I am amazed at the size and ability to continue to get bigger on the US taxpayers dime. 50% of the revenue here comes from the US government.
Being sued by the US government. I added more in the pre-market. Big over reaction.
"Don't be hesitate to pick up,little by little. cost average is the best way to own this stock. UNH will be even stronger that any body. Health Care Partner will generate earnings right away, and will be a greater part of UNH."
shorts have taken over. don't ignore the price action
"why is this down this much, any reason??!!"
It will turn green today because S&P is going north.
"This stock is starting to look very much like it's in a speculative bubble much like the Solar stocks were a few short months ago. I would short, but most of my funds are in an IRA that I do not short in. Very high PE ratio for a health insurer. Buyer beware!"
why is it down?
Stumpy is making jokes about the market crashing on twitter... TIME TO IMPEACH!
"Insurance companies produce nothing and contribute nothing. They are powerful leeches who have twisted the laws in their own favor. It is really a grotesque way of bilking money out of Americans that people are just now starting to understand.For any blinded Trumper to argue otherwise furthers my point. Trumpers are largely uneducated mutants and would love to kiss the President in exchange for him making their futures more bleak. Very weird, but very true. Cheato was elected by the poorest, most backward states in America and they stand to lose even more as he raids the coffers."
Love crazy 8's
UNH along with HD and V are the best long term plays in any investment portfolio. Anyone disagree with this statement?
Elizabeth Warren took heat in the fourth Democratic debate. Here are the night's top moments - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/15/top-moments-and-highlights-from-octobers-democratic-debate.html
How's that buy the dip in the morning routine doing for you Eh not so good huh .
And this is why I cannot have nice things. negative on a day where everything (except FB) is up
could see $240 to $250 close ----tomorrow will see over $250
Any chance expectations are too high? They always beat.. that's factored in.
Sweet mercy...
Sell the Rally.
gap at $224 look for retracing to 224-- unh up $30 in 12 days ..will retrace to $224 then thats your entry point.joe good luck. that is from friend at UBS
Sold my one week long trade yesterday at 3 pm. Today is what we call the Cramer Curse.
"It is for real that UNH will test 268-270 by the first or second week of October. I bet you that UNH will manage the cash flow and asset to buy back the stock and make earnings grow faster and beat the estimate. UNH stock works like the Swiss watch. Citi group analyst put the manure on UNH stock, that dropped 8 points on that day. I scoop it up 15 calls and add some more today when Powell raised another 1/4 points on the interest rate, couple with he mentioned that the health care cost will increase another 5 % for the next few years. If Trump tries to jack up the tariffs, in order to collect the more tax and don't cut spendings, we will be in trouble with in 5 years."
"I do not own this stock, but have recommended it to many younger people who were looking for decent companies with long term potential, decent dividend history, etc. But let's face facts today. UNH is supposedly going up because Bernie Sanders a person who realistically had zero chance of beating Trump is no longer leading the Democratic primaries?? What about the news media telling us by the minute about how the Corona virus will lead us into the next great Recession? What one sector will eventually be hit hardest by the Corona virus if it does indeed reach epidemic levels? The health insurers who have to pay all of these claims, yet somehow the Wall Street scam is pushing all of the insurers to near all time highs. I know the markets are rigged to benefit the uber wealthy, but could you at least once in awhile make it seem at least reasonable why a stock goes up or down?"
Why this stock is not splitting. Can you give me any reasons. It can not attract investments without splitting.
"unbelievable, this is nuts"
"you misunderstand, bernie and company arent talking about EVERY one on medicare, they would never do this because all those with great plans would resist........this is still libertarian country and bernie knows this, he is looking to put everyone else on medicare, and seniors would be screwed!......every government worker has a premium plan...as do teachers, fire police unions, those with employee health plans, bernie is speaking with forked tongue."
"UNH is down because of the technical chart, not fundamental. The chart readers think UNH will go down to around 235, the resistance which I think it is a little too crazy. I will buy UNH when it is red every day as long as Dow is green."
UNH will be over $300 by December I am a buyer at this level
Bought 500 shares at $25.86 (9/29/09).
Uncertainty and fear rule the day once again.
Can they buy Walgreens or CVS? Would make sense.
Just god awful
"Why UNH is still under 260, I wonder. The stock itself is undervalued obviously. The hedge fund money keeps relocating from high tech to health care."
What’s funny is Bernie drives around in a $250k car. Lol and he’s a socialist. People need to wake up
Couldn’t hold above 231 to close. Sold mine just little above 231 today
it is time to pick some more because the investors go on the contrarian. I am the one who do not think UNH is slow down at all. I still believe that UNH is the undervalue stock at this moment.
"Credit Suisse note.Macro Concerns Around Medicare-for-All/Rebates etc. Continue toWeigh on the Group. MCOs (including ANTM) have been under pressurethis week on the concerns related to Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for Allproposal, with some investors flagging that the inclusion of “pay-fors” providemore credibility to his push. We continue to see Medicare for All not goinganywhere. Separately, some investors have flagged a recent Alex Azarstatement asking employers to adopt POS rebates. On that point, we notesome of the insurers (such as UNH) have been already offering POS rebatesas an option for employers but the adoption among employers remains low."
Tommy can you see me?
He ready for huge selloff tomorrow. Dow up 241 points andnthis poor pitiful stock was break even basically up .23. Humana up 3.75. This management team let you guys down by having a bad overly focused business model on employee healthcare. Humana much better and that is what the price action is plainly telling you. See you at 230 by friday
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicare-rate-more-expected-health-210109782.html
245 by eod!
"What a great opportunity to start a position.....just hard to grab a falling knife.....looks like 212-214 might be the next level down if 220 does not hold, if not, all the way to 198....dang..."
"Hilarious, downgrade by some know nothing goof."
It's crazy how China Markets rally on tariff news but Americans sell off their shares. Sad!
Surely Citi wants to buy cheaper as they know UNH will deliver at ER ... I am not selling
Is this down solely on Democrats winning 2020 speculation ?
7000 march 16th 200 put contracts traded today. ???
Health Care is waking up
YES YES YES YES
"This drop in UNH is way overdone, UNH should easily be $310 if not get back over $320 very soon. If this drop is due to concerns over ACA being knocked down in the Supreme Court is simply wrong. UNH and others will always be entrenched in administration of medical benefits for ACA, Medicare, or any other plan the republicans may replace.I do not think ACA will be dropped by the courts as this has been agreed law, and the payment mandate is already eliminated by the tax plan. The ACA will remain or be replaced by some other plan, either way UNH will be OK. Obviously if dems win, no more ACA concerns. In short, this is a buy down here and a big buy if under $290.....start adding here slowly!"
I guess there may be something big happening that we don't know.
"Revist UNH: buy PANW now!UNH performs super well today, even though overall market meets selling pressure under BA's nasty profit-taking.Tomorrow same thing may happen for IBM's ugly ER. But IBM has been this way for many years, no hope if its CEO not be replace.Now take-partial profit of UNH and move to PANW which has more upside potential near-term, though long-term i am still the fan of health insurance stocks, like UNH, HUM, among others."
Looking to buy more tomorrow if it dips due to the Senate hearing
"Earnings could start this trending the right way again, as well as a plan from management regarding strategy for the political climate."
Time to get out now. Aetna cvs merger and more important the Cigna ESRX merger will hurt Unh. Cigna used optimum rx as it’s pbm. That contract won’t get renewed
sold my entire position
Changes to the ACA will not have a big impact on UNH as they have pulled back from participating in those plans. If there are negative events for the ACA might actually benefit them.
Bullish into close. Will be green tomorrow as well. Short term play advice.
DJ up and we're still falling! Wth? LOL
this stock is so undervalued...BUY BUY BUY!!!
I should of put a stop loss. On ANTM as well. Seems i buy too early and i sell too late. Guess ill be a long term bag holder
"mind as well just crash asap, its painful watching this trash"
Eric muted! SID and blue next?
"SO FAR... the only pushback from UNH ""IT Data Engineer"" HIPPA/HITECH VIOLATIONS is the opinion from MrsMSalt91 who denies the Undenied / Undeniable VERIFIABLE Documented Provable Facts. No lawful response (not even a simple ""cease & desist"") from the powerful politically connected and unlimited access to economic resources UNH principles about Historic Color Of Law / Criminal Deprivation Of Rights Privacy Abuses Who Knew What When.... clearly Mrs. Salt was left out of the loop... and came at me with the old tried and untrue angry short-seller meme. You often learn MORE from someone you disagree with opposed to someone with an ""opinion"". -- STRONG SELL!!! Sincerely (as always) Mark J. Novitsky"
Very Impressive. http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/20/news/companies/atul-gawande-jeff-bezos-warren-buffett-jamie-dimon/index.html
Its going to come all the way back and close green!
another awesome opportunity pull back... Hope you guys kept some dry powder for this new opportunity purchase!
took a dump at the end and all other insurers are still green... of course it did...
"Wow, I am done watching this train wreck today..."
"So, looks like UNH is heading back to $215 area. Then stock up."
What is wrong with this stock? Is it the fear the dems will win the WH and do a government take over (and RUIN) of the healthcare system? Typically UNH has been a pretty solid investment.
"Huge buying opportunity before earnings tomorrow. UNH got punished more than others in the sector, and will bounce back stronger."
Today's Upgrade after earnings: 7/18/2018 Citigroup Raised Price Target to Buy $288.00 and Royal Bank of Canada Raised Price Target to Outperform $284.00.
"The market see the potential competition by ABC except the judge, why?"
Out of all positions except for GOOGL and UNH
First time buyer today at $161.70. Hope I didn't buy at the high lol. But this is a 10 year hold for me.
Nice 20% div increase!
Short sellers are back... Expect this sort of action for another day or two.
"UNH has nothing todo with the AMZN story today. UNH has the biggest whole ecosystem in the country. AMZN can do only shipping "" PILLPACK "". Don't mess the NOICE with the FACT. CVS, ESPX AND WBA may get side effect but I don't think much."
UNH WILL OPEN TOMORROW OVER $260
Look Healthcare cost are too high. This being said there is no way today single payer will be adopted in 2020. This stock is crazy up and down like a yo-yo. At some point we as a country need to address this issue. The GOP does not have ANY answers and the Democratic's want to give everyone Medicare. I would say the drugs prices need to be addressed. This is the largest issue with costs.
Surely this is not selling off because of the Democrat Debates tomorrow night? Come on people use your heads.....Democrats will not get universal healthcare.
"I bought a ton of UNH and ANTM. These stocks sold off like we are getting rid of healthcare. Does anyone remember when Bill Clinton got elected? These companies make money hand over fist!!!!!!!!! It was painful and averaged down, but I can't believe this sold off like this. These are money makers. And baby boomers are needing more and more care. I would be surpised if these are not back over 300 in a couple of years."
"No one wants Sanders to win less than the Democratic party national leadership. Go do some reading by typing in ""brokered convention"" or similar. That should open your eyes. I'm long UNH."
long term shareholders are #@&$!&
trump picking up shares on this
"So they can't even get single payer passed in liberal states like CA and CO, let alone the entire nation? The Bernie herds may be loud but they are outnumbered by people with common sense."
"HOW YOU CAN STOP THE SUN FROM SHINING!. UNH WILL BREAK OUT AFTER JAN 17 BECAUSE UNH IS THE KING OF HEALTHCARE, IT HAS THE HIGHEST ROE, IT KNOW HOW TO USE THE LEVERAGE OF FREE CASH FLOW TO INCREASE THE PROFIT MARGIN THAT MAKES THE MOST ROA AND ROE."
Top is on here
Wondering if this is a good buy point for UNH or if it is still too high after the big move up ($15 in one day!) when it reported.
Unh- folks won’t have insurance soon
"in tomorrow's bloodshed, UNH may drop to low 260s again..."
Will be another lame year for the healthcare sector. Too many know nothing news personalities pumped it as undervalued....lol
This wants badly to reverse into close... Something is not letting it happen.
This should go 20 up
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161128005202/en/UnitedHealth-Group-Discuss-2017-Financial-Outlook-InvestorHere is this years statement mentioning 9.60 adjusted net earnings for 2017
"Should i keep this one for the long run, or sell now before market bottoms again?"
Down $40 (over 10%) from Jan. 8. following a solid report and solid guidance. What else can the reason be except uncertainty about what the Dems may do to the business model? Cuz based on the fundamentals the stock should be in the $360-380 range. All the HMO stocks are struggling for the same reason. HUM is $100 below its PT.
fack Bernie
How does a healthcare company act like a tech stock/ $111 in Jan. 2016 to $264?/ REALLY? How much more can assets be inflated by the FED with cheap money?
UNH is a $500 stock - expect analyst upgrades coming soon!
What happened to insurance companies in Canada when they switched over to universal health care??If you weigh the current odds of Bernie winning.....If you have decent money here.....Bail out and put ur money in a safer company like Disney....or if you have the balls Canopy Growth
"DE JAVU! 2 MONTHS AGO, IS THE SAME OLD NEWS. IT IS BS, THAT BIG BOYS SQUEEZE THE WEAK HANDS AGAIN. EARNINGS REPORT WILL BEAT THE ESTIMATE AGAIN. I ALREADY TOLD YOU LAST FEW MONTHS."
It appears that investor confidence is just not there even with great numbers. Makes no sense. I don’t think Medicare for all will pass. It dragging down all of my healthcare portfolio
"Who bought UNH when it drops 4.28 a while ago is very lucky. I don't see any reason why UNH will drop like some analysts downgrade UNH. Today all the tech sector has happy hour, but the dow 30 drops like a rock. I jump in too soon, if i wait just 15 min. I will get UNH when it downs 4+ points which is guarantee that I will not lose money for today. I think UNH will close around less than 2 points."
This is going to 250 will all the expenses of the testing and sickness coming!!!!!!
No reason this stock shouldn't be sitting over $400 by now. It will.
"Just another undulation caused by temporary risk off sentiment, and yes, overdue given the state of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with a lack of movement from the gov't on additional stimulus, this move was anticipated by many. Creating a great buying opp for us short term traders. Takes nerves to buy and take a hit, but the rewards come soon enough. The bump in GDP brought on by the consumer spending related to the first stimulus proves that it works for the medium term, and there will be another package coming. Meanwhile stock up on stocks while they are on sale. And don't pay attention to the punditry per the presidential election... unless of course you anticipate taking over a half million in gains, in which case I'd be taking it after the election if Joe wins. I believe there are some insiders at UNH that fit that category, not the least of which is the CEO and former CEO, but their sales would hardly be enough to move the needle."
Up 50% from March lows! Why are people smoking?
Split?
Absolute slaughter
UNH still has an open gap that needs to be filled the stock has done nothing in 3 months but go sideways until they let the stock go down and fill that gap it will just go sideways.
"BUY, BUY, BUY TODAY."
Just keep buying UNH when it is in deep red because it has nothing to do with CHINA.
"This is an interesting set up for tomorrow morning.. It’s rare to take a hit going into earnings, usually we are looking at a run up in the days before the conference call, then a premarket pop on the eps news.. and a fall back to the trend line as the conference call wears on.. But Now we are sitting a hair below the December 2018 high, it’s as if all of 2019 was a wash and we are about to set the sails for 2020.. I miss the steady hand of Helmsley on the tiller but I think our management team has learned not to go political in the conference call.. They need to keep their heads down and run the company, let the politicians say what ever they say, and ignore them. Obama often called the insurers “evil”, Helmsley just kept pivoting, diversifying and quietly explaining healthcare to those with ears to hear.. I hope that our new leadership does the same in the wild political gale of 2020."
This will be $300 by year-end
next lows to watch for test and bounce - 265 and then 260. under 260 we go to 244 area.
UNH and Walgreens merging - Huge Upside!
exceptional value at this level. I added to my position.
will that after hours $2.25 show up tomorrow?
Bernie's offering free stock for every American we need to be fair every American will get free stocks from every company
Free everything
Selling robots at work on UNH.
"Bought at 35 years ago, doing very well for me"
I sold 5 12 July $250 calls just for some downside insurance. No pun intended. Seriously.
support broken next level 212
Got out of UNH to many headaches and the stock is mired in controversy unethical overcharging. Look at self storage as a means to cash in on a secular trend in aging baby boomers as they store thier memories and move into apartments or smaller homes whats a few hundred bucks a month to protect your memories for life. EXR is the best run company and also sports a 4% dividend yield to go with that. Has recently had a nice correction and is 20% of it's high.
The crooked analyst downgrades UNH today. It is so funny that they downgrade a few days before earnings report. Let's see how the traders react to the news. UNH is very strong and number one in health care sector. It just increases dividends and buy back stock. I probably pick up some if the price going down over 5 points.
Lowlife shorts will soon get killed off when this political nonsense stops imo.
This stock isn’t even overvalued... PE 22 with years of good track record? What other stock is better than this?
"Less patient visits, insurance pocketed the premium ??"
185 next stop - when...? shortly - a play on words.
Bernie will not get the nomination. It looks like Dems came to their senses and turned the tables on him.
Where’s Eric?
The only stock with a worse news flow than UNH and the healthcare insurers is FB. It is unbelievable.
"Nov 24 210 call for $184 and I already up $2.32+, all idiot shorts are losing their shirts....hahaha"
231.00 for 4 hours today so far lol. No shame
"Medicare for all is impacting all the insurance companies. Not to mention all the software providers and any other healthcare segment company that will be basically put out of business by Medicare for All. Problem is Medicare for all isn't going to happen at least not in the foreseeable future. Can you imagine what would happen to all of these companies, the employees, the stock holders and so on. Healthcare is 20% of the US economy. Bernie and Elizabeth are not taking any of this into consideration. Not to mention how many trillions of dollars Medicare for all will cost. So, looks like UNH is going to suffer until and if someone besides this pair are the candidates for president."
"UNH is still under selling pressure, but it is better than last week. I think the worst is over, so 235 is not possible at this time around. I want to to buy after this week."
I think it is a great time to pick up UNH at this price and hold your breathe until Tuesday.
All managed Health Care stocks are down by average at least 4%. Whatever these Democrats are taking it's not going to happen. I doubt it will even pass House; forget the Senate and WH. This is just noise and folks are dumping it. In my opinion it is a buying opportunity provided it holds $250 support. There are so many negative articles in the press; can cause lot of panic among trader's / investors.
Nice comeback by UNH after the silly selloff last week. Nearly at a New 52 weeks high. What a steady performer.
The wrath of J P Morgan!
You guys have a dirty market maker in this stock who is poison
One of the greatest investor retired last week and he said the best skills to acquire is a STRONG STOMACH. I'm a beginner and I'll have to take his advice and ride this one out. Ouch and my stomach hurts big time.
Buy on Monday before earnings release on Tuesday. There will be a big big bounce on Tuesday.
UNH has price target of $340. Not sure why people aren’t jumping on this now.
UNITED HEALTH CARE'S MISSION STATEMENT: WE ARE DRIVEN TO DENY OUR HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS ANY HEALTH CARE BENEFITS WHATSOEVER.. UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE..... GREED IS GOD.... GREED IS GOOD... GOD BLESS RONALD REAGAN AND THE GOP.... MAGA MAGA MAGA... ISRAEL FIRST... AMERICA LAST.... HAHAHA... YARMALKAKA.... NETINYAHOOHOO..... YOU LISTEN TO ME... I TELL THE TRUTH... MAGA MAGA MAGA... HAHA.
"Buy dips, and sell rips....?"
"From Barrons: ""The stocks trade for an average of just 12 times projected 2019 earnings. And UnitedHealth, Anthem, and Humana already are generating double-digit growth in earnings per share. “Anyone who has a 12- to 18-month horizon and a value mind-set should be buying,” says Ana Gupte, an analyst with SVBLeerink. She puts only a “generous” 5% chance of Medicare for All getting enacted."" So the bill has only 5% chance and analyst is being generous. ALL NOISE brought by the media creates buying opportunities especially UNH having reported positive earnings beating expectations along with Raising profit guidance for the entire year!"
"in the past, any talk of cutting Medicare brought resounding opposition. What is different now?"
"It is time to pick the cherry, because the drop is slow down."
When will ESPP stock plan last offering period ( Jul'17 to Jan'18) shares deposit into the account to trade ?
"Bye, bye Bernie."
"Healthcare for all!!! It will only cost 32 Trillion. You tax payers got it, right?"
Lol this stock is he absolute worst ever
"The stock market is always forward-looking, so it's about how you perceive that. Irrespective of Bernie's outlandish proposed structure, a public option structured around the Advantage plans is the minimal that an overhaul of healthcare will include. So although the majors will survive, as they should, not destroying an entire industry, they will look much different than they do now. That gravy train, ripping off employers and consumers will end, leaving them much leaner at drastically reduced valuations. This is why over the rest of the year, irrespective of coming earnings, they will not be able to factor in the inevitable impact on their business model."
Might consider buying around $100
UNH is done. Amazon is here to stay
Stock is the largest best run HMO and yet is being treated like garbage even as Cigna is up some 6.60 the last two days. That’s almost 5%. UNH would have to be up 9.00 to be on the same level
GO DOWN GO DOWN I NEED MAKE MONEY
Here we go again. Down again.
Lol wow
250 at open !!!
"heres in the deal in my opinion. unh is a great company they are growing. the stock touched a December low only because of uncertainty with congress affecting healthcare. this wont come into effect for many many months, and it wont be medicare for all I can guarantee that. this is probably a short lived sell off in healthcare. unh is a good long term hold and in short term I think it will hold the support and move up from here"
"UNH looks very good to me as a Pure Earnings Long play. I am planning to go Long tomorrow afternoon with a large chunk of hard capital, to hold through Earnings Release. I expect this company to deliver strong earnings, beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, along with positive forward Guidance, and I expect the stock price will react positively, climbing up through the $290's and perhaps breaking $300 on Wednesday. Company has an OUTSTANDING Earnings History. Analyze the past TWENTY quarters of earnings releases. Going back 20 quarters, they have beaten the EPS consensus estimates ALL TWENTY times. And Revenue consensus estimates?? They beat 18 out of 20, and the two misses were absolutely TINY, 0.1% or less on both. Such a record is rare, and speaks to quality management at the top, and excellent financial discipline. I like the sector, and this stock is currently fairy valued. It is not cheap, but if you analyze all financial data, you see the valuation is okay. There is plenty of upside potential to $300+ in the near-term, and every reason to think a very good earnings report can give us a pop very close to if not above $300. Analysts are currently very bullish on this one, and I see few headwinds that could result in a downturn following the earnings release. Risk/reward ratio looks to be EXCELLENT to me, as a Long play Pure Earnings trade, and I am 99% certain I will be making this trade tomorrow. Would love to hear from other traders with reasonable arguments in agreement or disagreement. :-)"
Sold all my position in early July at around 258 per share. Good company but lots of uncertainty.
These guys are deep into so many aspects of health care. Seems solid for long time- over $300 in 1-2 years
"Someone just go ahead and plug this thing into some life support. Anyone thinking Bernie, Slow Joe or Pocohantas will win the election is seriously hurting. Can't believe these bums are affecting healthcare stocks."
On the day UNH jumped $18 (on earnings) Anthem jumped $14. Anthem reports Wednesday morning and will likely beat by a wide margin. Question is ......will UNH bounce higher because of Anthem's beat?
UNH is up 10.82% to 289.69
If by some chance this gaps open and goes up to 230 then sell because
Sold my unh in july at 245 and repented when this went into 280s. ..never thought i would see this again in 240s. Is this the right time to buy or wait for 230s?
Traders Beware libs debating next week. Last time after debates took a little hit
Lately UNH trades like a YO-YO. I love it because it will flex the muscle by Jan 17. I don't see any reason why UNH will go up this morning more than 1 point and turn red after Trump's news conference. The herd gets panic is the time to buy some more because UNH will prove that ROE is the best among its peers. GET SOME MORE because you will not see a good op. to buy it very often.
The stock came in hot. People were going to sell no matter what. Great time to buy. Will rebound within 4 days.
Nothing is free!!! Look at Venezuela lol
This management is totally asleep at the switch. Where is the big stock buy back? Guess they were just kidding
Does management just allow this manipulation for a year or what? They ever heard of a stock buy back
call 220 expires this week still does not move. It will be a big payday for them. BELIEVE ME.
Sold half of my positions so I can have some dry powder in case Bernie goes crazy again
All healthcare insurance stocks are under pressure and they will be until 2020 election is over. United Healthcare is the best in the sector and it's making a lot of money. but everything will change if Democrats take the Senate and the presidential election. Medicare for all or universal healthcare if implemented will cut United Health Care price in half probably even lower like someone else posted before me bring it down to the very Extinction. I am long the stock but this is a reality that we need to face as a stockholders
"Hit a major support level of December of where markets and many equities found support and initiated whats called today the ""V"" bottom."
Yikes. Is this a result of upcoming RBG replacement and outlook for ACA?
"Big Pharma is taking ads against me because I am MASSIVELY lowering your drug prices, which is obviously not good for them. Medicare premiums will also be going down. I am the first President to take them on. Don’t fall for their false ads. Biden plan is for very big increases! it this true?"
do we anticipate a sustained pop after earnings?
Lower is fine with me..... Have my low ball number set or I will adjust slightly. :) Happy #$%$ camper I am. Not even close to it yet.
245 by next week?
BUYERS COMING IN THRU OUT DAY -- BUT LAST HOUR GOING TO DOUBLE
Bernie is a moron
"wow, earning are next week damn it"
"one step forward, 3 fn steps back"
"Watch $257.70. That's the 50 dma and that's where the rally failed on Wednesday. If it breaks above that level and holds for a few days, and if the other health insurers participate in the rally, then perhaps we can get hopeful for $265ish prior to the quarterly report. But.......beware a selloff in to strength as we move closer to the primary season since healthcare will be a high priority topic."
"Single payer system inevitable. Health care is out of whack for 80% of ordinary people with family incomes of less than 70K/year63% of American families make 70k or less per year. They can?t afford health care. Worst hit are individuals 40 and up in age. Mind boggling are the costs of having health care. In some cases payments- monthly are 50-100 percent of individuals living arrangements. A Texas man working in a restaurant as a manager with 47000$ income at age 51 was paying 629/month, yet his apartment monthly rental was $650, how the heck do you justify this #$%$??? CEO of UNH makes 20 million per year! Greedy MF Bas , hope this scam of the century is taken out for good. We need single payer-govt to get the job done so we can then spend 600/ month more on groceries, gyms, movies, restaurant meal, dry cleaning, sports etc. we can grow our economy 2-3 percentage points as a result."
"Panic selling so far in 2019 after an excellent earnings... It is going to take time because the policy headline risk is not going away anytime soon, but if we have patience it will push forward again. All-for-one healthcare was tried in a few states in the past and it failed miserably so I'm not too worried."
Get in while you can!
Use logic and commonsense that whether possible that UNH will have disappointed earnings on Wednesday. UNH is like SWISS WATCH in term of earnings.
If I've learned anything about this stock it's that it almost always checks back to somewhere around the 50 dma after its post earnings run. I assume that's what's going on as I see nothing on the wires to account for the selloff.
flat since Dec awaiting the next rise
"This was a proper flush out. Def bottom. $235 end of next week. Also the June $260 calls are on fire, so other big investors agree."
Going back to 220
Psssssst! This is that Dip you've been waiting for...
Dead Cat Bounce is the most frustrating and maddening of all grrrrrr!
"A friend of mine used to say, ""listen to what the stock is telling you."" It's telling you fund money is leaving the whole group. Who cares if it's rational.........it's happening."
"wise to look at unh revenues and profits, not trade war.no one is raising tarriffs on health insurance."
Anyone have a handle on why the health insurers are all down on a flattish day for the market? ANTM down 2% with earnings on Wed. $70 below PT.Carry over from the Orange Menace's drug price EO's? Concern about costs related to resurgence of COVID? Any thoughts?

Still at a 10% discount - at least. JMO
"eric dissapeared like a coward. 20 posts on a red day, but gone on the green ones. What happened eric? I thought it was going to $200?"
Folks when is UNH expected to announce it's next dividend hike? It feels like stock has recovered from it's dip since the health insurance news from those trio of companies. A sustained break above the 230 levels should act as a confirmation IMO.
Up 4% that’s super nice!
Congrats to all who got in under 220
Looks like some pretty strong resistance at $225.
 with Crazy Bernie
When are we going to see $240 again?
"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble!

"I am long UNH. I can't believe how volatile this thing has become. Definitely seems like a buy here, if you have any gun powder left after all it's recent buying opportunities."

"If UNH can overcome the rates today, I think by Monday UNH will move up to 265 and then shoot up to 275 by Tuesday."
Today's game is about the $312.50 strike price expiring today. Open interest for calls and puts looks about even.
Told you
this awesome stock will easily achieve its $287 Target by year's end if not sooner. The political #$%$ from the Democratic side means absolutely nothing. these politicians love their private health insurance more than the rest of us. it's government paid...
"Great numbers and guidance, but taken lower by a 77 yr old socialist that caved into Hillary. This stock is a buy!"
crazy to see a name like UNH trading at damn near ath with election year approaching rsi80+. wow. i don't see massive upside here at all
GPO comin for UNH? Headin across the pond for some tax break like ascent?
"Somewhere a bunch of lousy bankers are buying this right now...This is the biggest blantant pile of BS I've seen on Wallstreet in the last year. Medicare for all, so we must sell.. Who is buying this garbage story?? If you sell on this then you've been had."
$61B...that’s a lot of biscuits in anyone’s kitchen!!!
This stock is almost BeautifulIt has such nice constant growth ￼With a good dividend and fair valuation. Great fundamental Heath and overall I nice company
Would you buy here?
It is time to load up UNH because it has no good reason why it drops 4 points. I believe some big boys press it harder to squeeze out the weak hand and scoop up at the close.
This is a crazy valuation for UNH. Just saying
"Yep, right on schedule, the shorts are back, and spewing the usual democrat party line about medicare for all. Tomorrow, we go ex-dividend. How many of them are willing to cough up the dividend on the share they borrowed from us? Not too many. Wait for it. Tremendous short covering coming."
earnings should help big time. isnt this just going down on speculation in politics?
I just sold out of my position. $100 gain on 12 shares Thanks UNH. WHEW!
Bought 80 shares 217.20 already in the green.... ha!
"Bought a lot of UNH, ANTM, and CI these couple of days. I wonder if the drop has to do with the new poll showing a 3-way tie between Biden, Sanders, and Warren?"
300 by year end
Add today’s gain to yesterday loss and you are still lower. Nevermind the Dow is up Some 650 points. This stock has severe issues
Any opinions about how the primary will effect it?
"To this day I still do not understand the street. Beat earnings, raised guidance and it’s still not enough. Guess burritos, fake meat and auto parts is what holds this country together. Gmafb."

I don't know what they're doing but keep doing it!
DOJ is part of executive branch not judicial. Only US supreme court can determine if ACA constitutional. Will probably have to wait until next year
"If the new health care plan works for Amazon, Chase and Berkshire employees, It can easily be tailored to everyone with every facility that participates and any person who pays the premium. Welcome to amazon health. Prime Members get 10% off on premiums and quicker service at participating facilities. Looking froward to it after all the #$%$ Washington has created for healthcare. Here comes the giant competition for UNH and all the other healthcare care insurance companies. Sell UNH buy AMZN"
UHC is not being honest to shareholders relative to significant problems with their HSA processor Optum Bank. Their software is not performing.
The BOD needs to slap some heads and shake things up. Management is screwing the pooch.
UNH in the future may require insureds to wear a Fitbit to be eligible for lower rates. Other healthhcare companies will follow.
"Sold 500 share Friday @ $288.50. Was in about 6 weeks, buying in for $224. That's a $64.50 per share profit, or ten bucks a share per week. Over 32K profit. Some taunted me for buying too soon right before the recent lows, and no doubt some will question the wisdom of ""selling too soon."" But I do that often and somehow my account is higher that it has ever been... go figure. I will likely buy back in on another dip. GLTA."
Medicare for all is the reason why all Healthcare stocks are going down and it does affect very existence of health insurance companies. I see further downside further Bernie Sanders goes further UNH price will decline. As of right now he is the leader from all presidential Democratic candidates
Nice earnings.. Not sure its enough to move the stock up after a great run. We may pullback a few dollars before headed higher. But on in all a great report this morning.
Worst stock even on its own industry. Underperforming everything: worst stock on the Dow this past week
Its naked short sales by GS that will never deliver typical Wall Street fraud
"Single payer Medicare for all, will be like out postal service....how is that working out idiot socialists???"
"the market has to factor in all healthcare companies regarding price or value of shares...elections and candidates are not positive for investments in this sector when the news is about cutting costs....so far as medicare for all? dont believe it. ALL government workers, politicians, teachers, fire, postal, etc etc, have insurance far superior than medicare... and they will not have it taken away.. but drug prices will be targeted, the question is will this be negative for research and development...(the usa is and has THE best) but this is due to capitalism."
What a bunch of whiners... This dip is a good chance to add to positions.
Typical action in UNH today. $7 off the high because.........index buying related to algo's took it up for no underlying reason..........and took it down for no underlying reason. It's all program trading in a volatile stock.
Stay long and strong. Don't think UNH is going anywhere.
"I was intending to sell a little bit of my holdings after tax time, due to a need to diversify, but find it very hard to willingly do that right now, regardless of my low cost basis. I voted for Bern last time, but he's lost me with this drive to destroy an entire segment of our economy. I'm probably keeping the hatches battened down, and waiting for calmer waters, to sell."
Sold 750 shares into the rally yesterday @270.50. Glad I did. It was a bear market rally at best.
UNH may hit the bottom yesterday and rebound nicely. It looks like 238 not 235 is the resistance for now if the market from now till next 3 weeks is not in tail spin. I believe that ACA will not have any impact on the future earnings.
"Johnston, no evidence of shorting. LMAO"
Lol seriously losers. Every hmo up today but guess who lol
Bernie! Bernie!! Bernie!!!
"See, any dip to $260 is a buying gift."
Bernie ahead of Trump in the polls
50/50 chance bernie wins atm........Look how quickly Biden crumbled in the first debate when challenged on policy records......One Establishment candidate down........
"Inflow money from hedge fund to health care sector 3 days in a row, is very good sign since quarter starts. UNH should get benefit from the inflow money because UNH's growth rate is in 20+%, plus 20 dividends increase and stock buy back will lift UNH even higher."
AOC endorsed Bernie is probably not good and almost guaranteed either Warren or Sanders be the nominee
"Headwind starts. Healthcare companies are not ready in addressing this issue. Remember, politicians are elected to represent voters. Before CEOs wake up, stocks will continue down. Can $180 wake up this CEO?"
CLOV will do well in the end. The time to accumulate is now. Give it two years
"isn't this ""downgrade"" $50 late? what a joke..."
Well this sucks
"""No man's life, liberty or property is safe while Congress is in session."" Mark Twain"
"Get in now, good entry point, will close over $264.50"
"Spikes up, like this, make me more nervous then the dips. I'll take it, though!"
Jesus. WTH?
77.5 Dow points drop for this single stock! what gives?
"I had this stock along time ago around $100. If you were to hold a stock, this is the one! I'm basically a day or week trader. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. My 2 cents."
Screw u Bernie !
Back up the truck!!!
Green green green all day!
"All I know is I hope this thing keeps going up so I can get out of my Healthcare mutual fund. This is one sector I'm absolutely sick of being in, no pun intended..."
Gonna go green. Unh is intrinsic value is 254. Buyers will grab the dip for sure
No need for benefit managers under Medicare for allFeel the burn.Lol.Not
"Will UNH be in the 240s prior to earnings? If it doesn't recover, I fear it may drop to the 210s."
UNH will explode after the earnings on the 17th.
No reason to believe this won't revisit the initial Covid-19 crash. I'll be buying in the mid-200's.
"800,000 shares dumped the last 8-10’minutes and there is no way their were buyers lined up to buy hay much stock so my guess is the specialist absorbed that stock and is now long that stock. My guess is he will try and bounce this at some point just so he can unload that. So if my some miracle this stock is up 1.00 or 1.50 tomorrow I would sell this or buy some at the money puts. No way today close is the bottom of this move"
UNH is down 7.01% to 263.98
"I guess the divy announce means nothing, down over $20 in 2 days"
Going to go up 2.5% today at least. The Bernie story was made up garbage/headlines to prey on people's emotions. Why did the banks lower their targets but keep their buy and overweight signs on this? Not hard to figure out.
"evidently, the market thinks that Bernie gets elected."
"Why post this? If you bought 250 puts last week and sold this week you took a MASSIVE loss. And you should have known it was headed up Friday due to the April 26, $230 call option activity. If you were going to buy June 21, 250 puts as a speculation buy, the best time to purchase this is Monday at the open."
LOL! Well take a looky at that Pre-Market!
"Bernie Sanders . . . . . BS for president?Yep, bs is what we’d get."
Sanders must rest in peace.
Good time to get in when it is in deep red. I like the price.
PE too high
SELL SHORT NOW NOW NOW NOW
Yesterday intraday low of 208 and closed back to almost 216 on BIG volume. Added shares yesterday and will continue.
"one step ahead, 3 steps back. This is fd up"
YES YES YES YES YES GO DOWN
UNH will probably go to $180.
Thanks Bernie. And for your next trick you will say that American car companies cause disease.
why the jump today?
Democrats going to get rid of UNH insurance companies that are killing health costs
buy unh stock - check out the data read all the news on yahoo about unh stock - https://prwired.net/2019/01/06/unitedhealth-unh-technical-analysis/
215 a cometh
UnitedHealth is up 7.43% to 345.23
who are lucky getting in at 232? amazed by the hype from amazon junk
"Going to 220 by Friday, easy short"
looks like i should buy after ER not beforeyou never know!!
Looks like same old pattern we just had in early November NOV. 7th gap up next day up a little more while the market was down than dropped back down to fill the gap. NOV 28th gap up today up a little more and now gap looms large to be filled.
"Who is selling this? The panicked sell low, buy high crowd."
This is why its down $5 today. UnitedHealth Cut to Neutral From Buy by Citigroup
"Single payer will never happen because first of all 1) no one wants to pay extra tax 2) our government is broke3) Americans are too damn spoil to have a 2nd class healthcare for all4) government can’t manage as always5) are all doctors, nurses, pharmacists, hospitals, dentists, drug companies ready for major cutbacks in salaries & possibly loss of jobs???? & Say goodbye to many future life saving drugs because why invest millions when government dictate drug price. There are so many negative & damaging consequences to our way of life just to help very small group of people have insurance but don’t want to pay or take responsibility. That’s why it will never happen. Good luck longs!!!"
"You guys aren't worried about amazon, jp m and warren buffet coming after healthcare ?"
Unh the most reliable stock around it will never let you down.
told ya
Cover it now? It's moving up quickly
Cramer said Friday this company will have an excellent earnings
"Come on now, let's get this in the green. Otherwise Bernie will be handing out free boobjobs and hair replacement."
Morgan sees $529 as a possibility. Can’t begin to tell you what that would mean .......let’s just say I won’t have to consider a cat food diet
"Just MM shorting to be able to cash in on all the calls they sold last Friday as they will all expire worthless Thursday. (Market closed Friday)You'll see this moving back up nicely next week. A lot of retail investors jumping ship, DONT, just stop watching UNH for the rest of today."
Nice bear raid today
Who here is happy with UNH's 4+% gain this week?Show your happiness...Yeah!!!
Hard to believe this hit $250 premarket.
Want to close above 240 today!!!
If u own this stock please watch Bernie Sanders Fox News town hall. I think the sell off intensified after that debate. Just watch it then make ur own choice to sell or hold
should i hold unh for next week? or sell of on Monday?
Is this stock still a buy at this price?
$UNH reports dividend increase of 30% in agreement with the board. Buyback increase still pending approval**** Breaking*****
"Just wonder the call 220 opened interest is still 4800 contracts, I don't get it, buyer is going to exercise the call or wait till the end to close it. This is a new thing i will learn. UNH has history to keep until the last day almost to the close, then pop up, last year."
Whoever does not take advantage to buy CI and CNC may be sorry to miss the best chance to own good stocks.
"It matters not what the Democrats may come up with as far as impeachment of the President. The House has proven that with the vote last week. The Republicans are solid behind DT even if he is guilty of an impeachable offense. Give it up, DT will be president for another 4 years in 2020. The Democrats haven't got a clue as to how to gain the majority of voters. Elizabeth Warren is in her own world as far as what she is promoting. The average American will not vote for her. To far to the left. Sorry Democrats. You will keep the House but not the Senate. There will be more Supreme Court Justices appointed by DT during his second term. A generation of super conservatives will control the court until mid century at least."
"Come on $410, say hello."
"So, what is so different today than yesterday, that warrants it going up instead of down? It's all complete BS."
"UNH will be $185 on Monday 3/23 close. By Friday 3/27, it will be $160."
Buttigieg won IA...
this was at 215 just 2 days ago..
nice
"I saw this dip to 285 and change around 7:30 PM in after hours last evening after the Iranian missile strike, and thought it might be a good entry point, but now that we are back to near 295, I'd rather short again (I exited my short on Friday at 289.50). Still waiting to see where it goes today."
ETF are likely triggering automatically ROBO selling as it hits lows off 200 DMA. Anthem getting slammed huge volumes on both traded.
Down almost $5. Huh?
Go down more so manipulators could make more money
It is a good time to get UNH long term accumulation. I don't see any good reason not to buy UNH at depressed price like this. My dad told me to buy the good stock when everybody panics.
UNH reached a new All Time High at 262.35
Yes!!
This stock is still a strong company but the stock is broken on left wing fears.
Good entry now because XLV shoot up through the roof.
"It is so funny, yesterday there is no clue for everybody to pull the plug from health care sector at all, but it did. Today it is suppose UNH will go down to the toilet, all of the sudden, everybody see the value of it. I dream of UNH going up to test 260 by the ned of the month, because I don't see any weak point at all."
UNH down almost 5% YTD. No real reason other than all the talk about healthcare for all. All the democratic candidates have hit on some form of healthcare for all. The thoughts are not well formed and will run into big problems when looked at more deeply. A great idea but the existing system will fight it with all their strength and money. Good luck with that one.
 mood
"Almost 2 points in two days, I don't think it is the time to accumulate this stock because the market keeps going up everyday. I just guess the market may pull back in the short term, then you can dip in."
"I honestly don't see how this is not a long term buy at this price. The weakness can be blamed on the medication price pressure from the government, but this is not a new issue, and existed at the all time highs. While I do not place much faith is analysts price predictions, this is currently running at nearly $50 a share average analyst upside. It has nearly $100 per share upside from the most bullish analyst. Healthcare is only needed more in the future, as Americans continue to eat fast food, drink/smoke, and put carcinogenic cell phones against our heads at a higher clip. Advancing technology will allow us to live longer, while using healthcare as a crutch like never before. Count me in as a buyer, ready to average down if needed."
"From Barron's..........Leerink’s Ana Gupte and John Sourbeer see “improved odds” of passage by the Sept. 30 reconciliation deadline. In that event, the pair sees greater earnings downside for companies levered to Obamacare in the near term than the previous House and Senate repeal-and-replace efforts.Gupte and Sourbeer offer these details regarding the hows, the whys and the which ones.Specifically, the bill proposes flat funding for Exchanges and Medicaid expansion through a block grant of $136 B in 2020, unchanged from the current ACA baseline in 2017. We expect that this contemplates an absolute reduction in funding in 2018 and 2019 to smooth the transition while any HIX related stabilization could be limited. The bill is more benign in the medium term 2020 to 2026 than previous Repeal and Replace proposals AHCA and BCRA with a mid-single-digit funding CAGR from $136 B to $200 B in block grants by 2026. Further, the funding is designed to drive a more level playing field between current expansion and non-expansion States. Medicaid HMOs CNC (MP) and MOH (OP) in particular that are levered to the ACA across both Exchanges and Medicaid expansion are likely to be impacted to the downside even in the near term 2018-2019. Hospitals are also likely to face downside but to a lesser extent. Diversified MCOs are more defensive particularly HUM (OP) and CI (OP), though we see the exposure as manageable even for AET (MP), UNH (OP), and ANTM (OP). Further, we expect that the bill may potentially be able to fund a delay or repeal of the Obamacare Health Insurer Provider Fee through tax reform if it should successfully pass legislation. Key upcoming catalysts include a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Sept. 25th with a floor vote before month-end through reconciliation."
"The earnings estimate will be crushed completely, the body language from the company raising the dividends 20%, plus buy back stock, proved that UNH has confidence that they will rule the world."
UNH denied a 13 year old a new wheelchair because she was growing to fast.
GS fraud
All financial metrics are solid. I feel like it’s still the unknown political climate that is holding UNH back.
"Why is it down, any downgrades? Anthem is up nicely..."
everything rallied yesterday except UNH :/
"Knee-jerk all the way. Slight increase in the medical cost ratio and the triggers were pulled. And,by the way, never ""disappoint"" the analysts by missing their estimates. It's amazing that it can be thunder and lightning minutes after earnings reports are released and the sky can be clear within a next day or two. It to me is something like shoot now and aim later; or act now and think later. But that's the way that it is."
Sold half of UNH at $282 and bought CVS AETNA.
"Thought about selling this WINNER the other day but didn't. After hours on preliminary forecast prior to shareholders meeting stock was down. So, what does this 'WINNER' do? Just goes to ALL TIME HIGHS. An example of a WINNER!"
"Big chuck 34,054 sold at 5pm"
"Largest Health Care Company - 88% held by institutions - 25 points below 200 day moving average - EPS $12 - Dividend for those before March 11 - AOC roles out Green Deal - Republicans control congress minimum 21 more months - Take what you want to buy, make half that purchase today, reserve the other half for a cautionary short term future dip purchase, and go long.This has a 2019 climb ahead."
Do you think it will go back at 225-230? Im so worried
265-270 by July 20th. I have no doubt.
"Really impressive to gain so much, and give nearly all of it back in one day. Such a love/hate relationship with this stock."
Year over year growth is expected to rise as population of retirees grows to over 25% of the population. Only can go up year after year to meet the senior health care growth. Just like the funeral parlors it is a growing business as the population ages. Kind of a morbid but true fact.
"A friend told me that each day is the same as the otherr days , that it is the attitude that changes"
"Why are all the directors exercising options and then selling all? Watch for the Hemsley sale, coming soon!"
Only 2 Dems (Sanders and Warren) are really enthusiastic about Medicare for all. Neither will come close to getting nomination. Will be Biden vs Trump. We are safe for at least 6 years. The move against Big Pharma seems pretty universal. That helps us as lower drug prices mean bigger profits for UNH. Stock should go up big in am given tonite's debate.
Merciless!!
I thought it was heading to $250 this morning and here it's at $241 now
Pre earnings bear raid. Watch what they do in AH. Whatever they are down today they will be up that in AH. Shorts trying to cover now.

buying opportunity.... $300 stock available at a vunderbar discount...
never split for sure. It was 23 per share since 2011
Wow. Negativity around the insurers is intense. UNH held up better on Friday with a down 466 market. It's going to be a much longer wait for April 16th than I thought.
"went down by 4 dollars yesterday, today up by 5. what gives?"
I will buy back more if it ever pull back to $207 or below
Good time to step up when it is red. Some hedge funds drop UNH to the toilet. So it is time to pick up some calls.
This stock is now so cheap...you have to buy...
Help I’ve fallen and I can’t get up
glad i sold at 159.50
no question this was a fund dump. either fidelity or another big fund. They know something
Not a buyer within a thousand miles of this stock. It can’t even have one bounce back day
Here we go again... Bernie?
"eric bought a boatload of naked puts, desparate for price to drop, thinks he can single handedly talk the price down. pathetic, beeg time. probably wise to take his loss, like a man, and go long. company is too solid to go down much"
"I said up 2.5%, almost there. Let's go."
This stock is ludicrous. Buy buy buy!
GO DOWN MORE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GO DOWN MORE
Geesh! We got 18 more months of political BS to endure with this.
UNH down 13% YTD. It all politics not performance.
End of last weeks dad cat bounce is over and done.back to 220
Sold my $250 June 21 options purchased last week. We’re due for crazy Uncle Bernie to get off his rocker and drag this back down. Have a good weekend folks!
Slow and steady gainer. Up 37% in a year.
"bitter shorts, lol."
"Considering the environment, earnings/ revenues were excellent!"
what in the heck is going on? I wake up to a bloodbath and can't find any news.
Anyone seen figures regarding UNH outlays for testing and long term care related to Covid?
Analysts expecting 38% drop in earnings....bet you UNH surprises and holds serve. They typically exceed expectations. When that happens $270-$275 and onward
All the health insurers getting beaten today w/ the Dow up over 200. I guess healthcare is not the space to be in based on whatever scenario the street sees for CIVID this winter. Earnings estimates remain the same.
You can’t blame politics or warren because the other hmo stocks are up much more
Bear raid continues here
SELL MRE COME ON SELL I WANT GET MY NEW CAR FERRARI TODAY
Down go Frazier down goes Frazier. Wow this stock is a nightmare
"One more time for the novice out there, Investment advice from the Oracle himself: “Fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Time to buy folks."
"For what it's worth Morningstar likes UNH, calling it undervalued, from an article they published here yesterday: “Under one roof, UnitedHealth houses the largest private health insurer, a leading ambulatory care and health analytics franchise, and the soon-to-be second-largest pharmacy benefit manager by volume in the country,” notes Conover. “Cost advantages and network effects generated by the company's size and scope underpin UnitedHealth's wide moat and we think support its ability to serve clients at a lower overall cost than that of rivals. The result is enrollment growth and returns on capital that are nearly unachievable by competing firms.”https://www.morningstar.com/articles/950329/articleLooks like some profit taking today with the health insurers this morning, lets see how it goes..."
"Facts are in and company didn’t change yesterday from today. Let short term trade wash out and you will see steady gains, eventually all comes back to investors looking for a undervalued stock at a great price."
What will happen tomorrow
El Erian advises against buying the dip... Fools rush in.
222 at close
I'm still longer this market. Go UNH!!!! Not afraid of Ghosts!!!!
@eric is on suicide watch
We are also due for a dividend hike!
After watching last nights debate I have concluded the Democrats cannot agree with each other on the healthcare for-all not yet along against Democrats and Republicans in the Congress and Senate. When they were asked to raise hands who will give up their private Health care plan for government run healthcare insurance only two of them raise their handsConclusion buy UNH
Unh has firm grounds....I think 25 plus in next3 months.
UNH will announce split soon...probably 2:1
Sell the rally!
"Don't buy now, it's going lower, much lower."
"Apparently this is the first time we have seen officials at UNH publicly acknowledge ABC (Amazon, Berkshire, JPMorganChase) as a competitive threat... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-sues-ex-executive-taking-232000516.html"
Look like a solid recovery...hoping it closes green and move toward the 260s in the coming weeks.
Asoko214 where are you???
"If you watched last night's debate, Biden confirmed he would not get rid of private insurance, public option would be an addition only. This may not matter since he may not win the election. However, it removes the risk of the election on UNH, ANTM, CI, HUM, etc. And if Biden wins, Medicare Advantage will see large increases in business for UNH, CI, etc."
Buying opportunity!!!
"Rate Update For MCOs Will Vary Due To STAR Ratings Variance. Dueto Y/Y stability in STAR ratings, we estimate the rate update for HUM andUNH will be largely in-line with the overall industry update. For Cigna, wesee the STAR ratings related tailwind in 2020 resulting in 40 bps betterthan the industry average. Given STAR rating headwinds for ANTM andCVS/AET from 2019 to 2020, we estimate the corresponding rate update(before HIF related headwind) for ANTM and CVS/AET at 1.2% and 2.2%,respectively. For CNC/WCG pro-forma, we estimate 2020 rate updaterepresenting 100 bps better than the overall industry average, primarily dueto Y/Y STAR rating improvement for both CNC and WCG."
"Should have been the first one to the exit, sold the top and got out. Pretty soon it will be too late. You know it's a pump n dump, all those analysts, media people saying to buy HC. You've been duped..."
man these fn dems are playing the market
Unh likely to buy wba very soon
Cramers oscillator was at -5 on Nov 26th and we bounced big ove the next two days......oscillator now at -10.DONT SELL>......bounce sometime on Friday
Wow look at you. What a great buy yesterday.
Priced for a $10 move. Fingers crossed that not much happens.
CVS Antitrust concerns....maybe look at UNH.
Fast money went over positive points on unh.
Sanders gaining in Iowa polls means Anthem and United will be on down trend next week. Sad!
Politics is playing a role in the decline. There is no real possibility that healthcare for all will come about anytime soon but the candidates on the democratic side keep pushing it. It is killing UNH and other insurers due to the uncertainty created here. More likely there will be a modified ACA if a democrat wins. Imagine if you can the impact of healthcare for all. All the insurance companies would be significantly reduced or eliminated as a Medicare type plan would take over. What about all the employees and the stock holders of these companies? How long would it take the Federal Govt to implement such a plan for a couple of hundred million people?
bottom Wuz reached?????? will recovery take us back yo 250?
That’s how hedge fund tigers do it. Drag it down right b4 earning and then pounce on it. Watch & learn
Invest in the mask manufacturing companies. Can't get disposable masks anywhere and US only has 30 million! you can bet they will have a nice qtr!
told you guys !!!!!!!!NOW UNH WILL SEE $250 TO $260 TODAY AND $300 BY FRIDAY
adding here
When is the last time this stock closed strong and closed up more than 3.00? Lol this thing is misery
This is a little like dealing with a kid who is afraid of the dark. How do you convince a child there is no monster in the closet? Kids are irrational...........so is the market at times.
"Who bought UNH this morning, hit jackpot. UNH is a no-brainer stock at this price. It will be 300 stock in the next two years."
the dealer has all the cards and he is taking us to the cleaners!!!!!!!!!!
"Who's selling at these levels? Easy ride to $235 If it's shorts, that's courageous."
They see your account and try to bust you.
"Anyone ever tried to call these guys? You are referred to the Phillipines where they want your bank numbers and credit card numbers. Fat chance of getting that. come on UNH, get somebody in Minnesota to answer the phone."
Anyone know why we're down 3% today?
"UnitedHealth is paying its retiring CEO two years of salary and bonus, saying he played 'an instrumental role' in leading the company."
Are we gonna ignore the fact that their target price is still way above the price right now? Haha
Specialist and market makers fully committed to 231.00 as the top
could it be an early morning dump to clear out stops?
Get ready to hit 200$ very soon. United rocks!!!!!
Time for the CFO to be fired.
This stock is totally dead. Down every open for 3 weeks except maybe 1 day. UNH must secretly be importing foods from China lol. We have some real genius manaheging money these days
"Buy the stock and hold. One day maybe after the election, all this nonsense regarding this company will be in the rear view mirror."
This is moving today more like a semi-volatile tech stock today.
This stock will never have another 3% up day its junk and its waterlogged by index trades. Most the trades pnntime and sales are less than 10 shares with many 1 and 2 share trades. Who trades 1 share lol. This stock is #$%$
Stock is a scam. Really when is the last time this stock was up and closed up a lot ? Sorry up 2.80 or 3.50 isn’t a lot. It may be for a $40 stock but 3.00 is nothing at all for a 230 stock. Stock is useless
Torpedo alert! Dive! Dive! Dive!
"Ha, I knew it, this thing cannot hold. Going back down, glad I took profits. Most likely, just another pump and dump scam, with people acting like HC is the sector to jump to now that Warren has lost her fire (and marbles)...."
"NEW POLLS-Show Biden way ahead of all other Democrats. (go to real clear politics.com). Old Joe, NOT a big proponent of Medicare for all. He was big on Obamacare, a system that UHC prospered under. We are now close to critical level of resistance and about to take off."
"It is trash talk by some crooked to make UNH look bad.I really feel disgusting, they just do it without dignity at all, which I guess CRAMMER knew it since last Friday, particularly Citi downgraded UNH today. Hey but I still buy UNH at this price."
"This one dow stock is responsible for over 1/2 of the dows rise.Many others like intel being sold,off...Why are pros selling other dow stocks ?"
Is it possible that UNH has finally become untethered to the news cycle?
I’ve seen Dead cat bouncing before it’s a signal to a big cut and recession
"UNH will test new high again before Oct 16, which I guess 270-272, The stock faces the headwind from the interest rate, which I think it is non sense because the rate should not have nothing to do with health care. Remember my word: UNH will overcome the the rate and hit all time high 280."
What is up with UNH? I think it should be around $300 per share...yet here it is at 240...any reason for concern?
"POLITICAL POLLS- Go to realclearpolitics.com. Obvious that Biden gets the nomination. Way ahead in ALL early primary states. Also look at senate map. Almost impossible for Dems to obtain majority. Verdict, Medicare for All is dead. Even if Biden can win, he will just strengthen Obamacare. UNH thrived in that environment. It will do even better if Big Pharma is pressured to lower drug prices. Bottom Line, UNH best of breed, boosted dividend, and increased guidance. Stock provides upside growth and is defensive at same time. No exposure to China and politically secure. Going to 300, safely and with decent dividend while we are waiting."
Wouldn’t people need healthcare services if this coronavirus were to actually insect US? Buy UNH
Hard to believe it was at $238 today and delivered good earnings.
TEVA rebounding from 52wk low today. Breaking into 14’s now! Get in while you can!
"Bernie needs to follow Hillary’s lead and just go away ! Can’t stand these lifetime politicians, don’t they ever retire or do they just enjoy hearing themselves talk to much ?"
Humana down 16 so tomorrow this can be down 10-16 more
"There is the second Democratic debate coming up, anyone think UNH will be a victim again of the 'Medicare for all"" rant that brought it down last time?"
Freefalling! lol Now you know why I say sell the rally.
"Sweet, my long term UNH is now up over 200%. Nice, it joined the club along with Amgen."
Overblown reaction good buying oppt
23 analysts have $288 to $345 range for their 12 month target. WOW! If they are even close there is big money to be made for longs.
Boom! I've been a long term hold for over 10 years. Best decision I ever made.
I went long for the first time this morning at 228.20 and it immediately started cratering as soon as my order was filled. I’m sorry guys
Elisabeth Warren 2020.
yes we will see nice pop at the end of the day. It will be a pop down
"MEDICARE FOR ALL is becoming a dead issue. I urge people to look at the polls and projections for the 2020 Senate race. It is almost impossible for the Republicans not to hold their majority. In fact, it really looks like they will gain seats. Worst case scenario would be 2025 for a major healthcare overhaul. In the immediate future, Big Pharma is a risk, not HMO's. Lower drug prices are a PLUS for UNH not a headwind. Wish I had bought more at 210. That was truly a gift. We should go to high 200's by end of the year."
Beautiful earnings and guidance. Growth looks sustainable. Great long term investment so far and for the future!
"Will drop another 7% tomorrow, enjoy."
UNH will hit 230-235 by Oct 16.
"This is nuts and I do not see the current administration policy im the worse case scenario be harmful to UNH. I think even if they went to the extreme for single payer govt run healthcare or extended a single payer option in ObamaCare, that UNH would benefit as the administrator of such plans. UNH benefits from Medicare/Medicaid so extending the rolls should be a positive. Am I wrong, do you agree?I am torn to add more, but think $318 coming soon as its the 200 day average. Assuming my thinking above is correct. Any opinions welcome."
Very nice report. Up over $3 pre-market
Anyone gonna accumulate after Cramer puts target 261?
Obviously Goldman was long Cigna and short UNH
"Time to short this fattened hog. Biden isn’t in charge- AOC and Bernie and they’re going to kill private health insurance if he’s elected. UNH, Cigna, HUM, anthem are going to get cut in half or worse. Every neighborhood will have a shiny new community clinic with a two year waiting list to see a Venezuelan doctor."
Sell and run folks there are very few stocks out there with gains in 2018. The bear market is around the corner don’t fall a victim and lose all your gains for this year
"What Happened?.....went to lunch and bang, we lost the gains today. OK the ""Investment gods"" want me to work harder and make me wait longer for those new Jimmy Choo Shoes. LOL"
"This stock is still getting hammered, I wonder where the floor is and when a good time to buy more to dollar cost average."
Why do people sell in the $210's when they could have sold at $270's?
"The market makers are working again to squeeze the weak hands again. I bet you that UNH price will come back at the close because tomorrow UNH will report the earnings above the estimate as usual. UNH earnings is accurate like Swiss watch. I bought some calls this week because it will pop at least 5 points as usual. What a world not to buy UNH which has PE 16, dividends, growth rate over 12%. It is number one in health care sector and still down over 25 % from high."
The stock is down $30 in 5 days on about 50M shares traded. That's isn't a short attack. Too much volume for it only to be that. Fund money hitting the exists is the only thing to explain that kind of move on way above average volume.
What do the liberals plan to do with the half million people employed by managed care health companies?
UnitedHealth reached an all time high at 331.48
Bad SOTU message coming on bringing down drug costs?
"UNH and CI are in play. You can pick any one, UNH will pop up Thursday morning and CI will pop up on Aug 2."
guys ou ant seen nothing yet --laur its going to rocket up $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 300 tomorrow
at this price unh is looking very tasty! wondering if we are NEAR the low??
"People are going back to see Drs for preventative care and prolonged ailments that they put off for some time. Could this be a concern? I think so. While so many companies are self insured, UNH had many individual policies and other exposures... One positive, the birth rates are down over the past year, and Babies are practically the Number one expense for many companies..."
"apparently healthcare provider margin are not huge. dividend please, or lower your debt"
"This one will be odd for earnings. The consensus is that EPS will increase. Anecdotally, because everyone is staying away from hospitals, except those concerned with COVID, and because physicians are super reluctant to take appointments, there should be super low demand for those services. That would normally suggest good earnings. However, because the optics of coming out with a blowout earnings report, during a supposed health care crisis, would sit extremely poorly with both the American public and the government in general. That is the sort of thing that turns one into a poster child for greed. So, I suspect that UNH will be ""hiding"" (ie, deferring some or bringing some non-recurring charges in order to reduce the bottom line numbers) positive earnings figures and won't be increasing the dividend, at least for this quarter."
"Not seeing any headlines per Amazon Healthcare Initiative following their ER yesterday, yet. However a quick search revels lots of mainstream media reports out now from their prior announcement, NYT, Forbes, CNN, too many to list here."
I will be able to buy some calls tomorrow for cheap. Hope it opens down 3 and hit 235. I will buy 20 calls 230 strike with 3 weeks with stop if stock prints 234.30. If 235 doesn’t hold then 230 will be where they take this for opex. Was able to buy 20 puts today in the at 3:55 pm

"""Why UnitedHealth Shares May Keep Moving Higher From Here""Jun. 11, 2019 7:17 AM ET| Chris Lau""United Health reported a strong first quarter that sent the stock higher since then. Services revenue shows promise of faster growth. UnitedHealth's Outlook, Even after UnitedHealth stock rebounded, investors who missed the rally may still buy the stock at a discount. At an adjusted EPS growth rate of 20% and enough cash flow growth to cover the dividend commitment, the stock has plenty of room to move higher."""
235 acometh
It looks like less than 1/3 of his holdings were sold. Not a bad diversification move.
Today UNH shows the sign of strength of Dow stock. The chart shows that UNH has postive RSI that can push itself to 260+ by the time of early April. It is a big jackpot when UNH reports the earnings.
MY biggest holding. UNH. Second biggest. UNH third biggest UNH. 4th Biggest. 5G build out stocks.
Might the junk go under? many patients
Healthcare stocks are doing well also today
Now...are you ready for the ride to 300?
"I counsel caution here. Only because the Orange Fraud will take aim at Medicare to compensate for the budget busting tax cut should Repubs hold the House. Otherwise, UNH is a great combination of domestic growth, value, and a defensive play in the Trumpian world of tariffs and trade wars."
Medicare for all it's a stupid idea that cannot happen anyway according to Bernie you should tell every stock because they want to change America and every way everything they want to give free if that happened so we going to end up like Venezuela so you can tell the whole Market if America stays America this stock is a steal
"Still call 220 does not move yet, that means UNH will go even higher, I sold part of it, but still wait and see the price movement. The all time high is 229-230. Short term bet Jan 19, call 225 is very interesting."
buying at 228
"It just showed up on my Fidelity newsfeed, UNH is one of the most purchased stocks today....boom"
265 acometh
"I would not buy here. Medicare for all will be discussed for the next year or two. All candidate s will be either supporting it or against it. This discussion alone will keep the entire sector in a down beat. Better wait until it bottoms, which I think will be a year from now."
"I just keep buying UNH because I don't believe that UNH has any weak spot this quarter. I believe they rack more profit because of OPTUM. The reason why I buy UNH because ANTM does not go down to toilet with the health care sector, and I believe that second big should be the first big."
"Have been in healthcare sales now for 29 years, it’s amazing to me that there hasn’t been a public outcry for companies like UHG that are public. The whole premise behind insurance companies is to collect monthly payments and then deny deny deny and delay delay delay payment to physicians that put their butts on the line everyday to do what’s best for you, I. Think about why UHG is worth!"
The entire market is not moving. No movement on last 1 hour on any of the 20 stocks on my streamer. Talk about a phony market. Just all set up and rigged
I plan on asking upper management if they have any plans for a formal comment on our stock price during today’s town hall.
I hope the democrats get cancer
"Jayapal said 1 mil ins employees will loose jobs. Her solution is to hire them to run single payer, but imagine effects of 30% pay cuts to every single health providers, including MD’s, RN’s, hospitals, pharmacies, dentists, physical therapists, etc"

I'm in at this price.
"Shorts are like squirrels. They get bolder and bolder, but at the sign of a BIG DOG, they scatter."
"Buy the best within their industries when they get hit hard. Did that with Facebook, Apple, and have been accumulating UNH up from the recent bottom averaging in. Money comes back to them. Don't go for the value rivals, the market doesn't. Political noise allows us to buy low, happens every election going back many years. UNH still off its highs of 286.85 offers value after posting positive earnings and raising profit forecast for the entire year."
The traders are not stupid after all. They know which stock is A REAL DEAL.
What is going on with the share price today?? Why the drop within seconds down over 6 points? Any one have any idea what and who sold shares or manipulated share price out of the blue?
What I don't understand is that the Bernie news came out yesterday. Why did the sell off happen today?

"I looked at this stock during trading Tuesday (actually spent up to 3 hours researching it), and I couldn't find any reasons for the drop. I went in and bought 200 shares at $247 and got a few July 20 and 27 calls. There seems to have been strategic and programmed selling. Nothing wrong with this one. I believe this kind of stock might open today at over $10. We may see a new 52 week high by Friday also. These are just gut projections."
"United Health at support, $310 Call for 5/15 will print if opening is greenhttps://imgur.com/a/fyYmafi"
Take a look at MNKD that United Therapeutics just made a deal with to license their innovative Inhaler United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ: UTHR) and MannKind Corporation (NASDAQ: MNKD) disclosed a collaboration for pulmonary hypertension products.
"Pull back hard, then good news comes in, I believe it will go test new high again next month. I have no doubt about the earnings because they always play low ball number."
Where will this stock go with Democrats in power any thoughts?
Look at Humana vs unh over the past week. Not even close. Humana was up 6.60 Friday and up 2.50 yesterday. Unh was up 1.30 and down 1.00. So today Humana is down .5% while unh down a huge 1.2 %.Of course why not Humana is based in Kentucky where the people have some semblance of common since whereas Minnesota is a state that elects nut jobs like Omar and Keith Ellison. So no wonder people are dumping this terd burger
"Notice the banks come in and while they lowered their targets, it's still either overweight or buy. I do wonder why....not hard to figure out."
ouch...this hurts
What a waste of an upgrade today.
"Down much more than the market. Which is puzzling since it’s not economic sensitive, and has no China exposure. The people that own UNH are just too stupid as they dump it for stupid reasons"
"Good, keep going up so I can get out, lol."
Nice $12 recovery from Tuesday low. Keep it up.
This girl is on fire!
Can't believe this.... target price raised 2 days in a row by different analysts and the stock still goes down.
Buy when UNH is in deep RED only.
You've Been.........TRUMPED !HEHEHEHE
"Nice bounce back off the panic from the DOJ scare, but UNH is still a few dollars below the highs of last week before the scare. If there even is anything to the DOJ investigation, it will take a very long time to play out, and in the mean time, UNH share price and dividend payouts will keep increasing. UNH is the best run company in healthcare."
Guess the market makers and specialist weren’t short calls on Cigna today
it'll be back over 300 a month from now.
"UNH ""on hook"" for mopping up Opioid Crisis - while congress helps Sacklers HIDE billions = more concerning than ACA carrotACA = political carrot of SuperPACSSuperPACS used to be criminal, like Bloomberg BUYING VOTES smells fetic"
4 days of green in a row. I'm expecting this to be red today but longs are still looking good.
"I reiterate, the easy win for Amazon will be Rx. PBM mergers have been all the rage, but this is a game changer. Look for OptumRx to take a real hit."
The folks who were selling the stock last week knew the report was coming. They had every reason to think it would be a good report. They sold anyway. They are selling more. Bottom line..........rational or not...........healthcare is out of favor. It could be for some time. Don't get caught in a value trap because the multiple is in severe compression.
"One of the best run companies, nothing but fear of something that won’t happen. I’ve worked in healthcare over 20 years and Bernie’s free for all will never happen. Healthcare is a huge slice of GDP and too costly to fund under a single government payer system. You think national debt is big now, try universal healthcare and see government debt balloon even higher."

What amazes me about this company is that 50% or so of their revenue comes from the federal government in the form of Medicaid and Medicare.
"NOT ONE of those losers last night can be Trump. Tonite, look for Sleepy Joe to screw up as well. NO ONE going to beat Trump. At the end of the day, its ""the economy, stupid"".

Senate is not going to pass medicare for all. Obama couldn't even get this done while he had both House and Senate.Health Care industry creates too many jobs and surely those senators from where big Health Care headquarters are will not vote for Medicare for all.

"Warren Buffett has a saying about the stock market and investing in general: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" When I said sell the rally, folks were greedy and said no way. Now they are fearful so be greedy!"
This is a very sad and lonely stock right now. It can go down but it can’t go up. It’s jut not the same stock as it has been. It would always go down but in the past it would bounce and find buyers. Not now. The stock doesn’t even bounce anymore. Stock goes down on up 300 days and goes down 6 on down 800 days. I guess the one thing ou can count on is it will go down. Better to buy Apple or amazon at least they move on both directions

I bought more down here at 222. Div was paid yesterday. I say the bottom was today. I am sure some naysayers might have something to say. Long this stock
Who bought UNH at 237.81 today? Tooooooo Funnnnnnnnnnnny!
Employees who buy via ESPP don't mind the price fall as it just lowers year end price that sets the bar for purchase price first half of 2019.

down on an up day... sell any rally.
POS Laggard. This stock is a death by a thousand cuts
I sold half my outs with this down 2.00. Will hold the rest

$270 buy next earnings! GLTA!
Up 4200 on my calls? Should I sell?
"Wow, UNH has $31.94 in debt with a book value of $44.73. Of course these days investors just look at P/E. Peter Lynch in ""Beating the Market"" said GAAP makes companies with high debt look better because EBITDA hides interest payments. With everyone giving their money to the mutual and index funds people who knows what UNH will do. My bet is our President bashes this to $175. They'll further miss earnings this week as more people collect on insurance due to hurricanes & fires."
Lots of calls being boughthttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-volume-peaks-health-insurers-183222171.html
GO GO UNH.....well done boys
will it still love me in the morning ?
"So, on the one side there are reports that the large insurers are actually benefiting hugely from the cut-back of elective procedures. On the other side they are covering all of the COVID19 testing costs and much of the hospitalization costs and probably the vaccinations costs next year. In sum, will their costs go up or down? There is at least one report that premiums will want to go up as much as 40% next year but I couldn’t find wide consensus for this prediction. To complicate matters even more, the open enrollment period will start in the middle of the next election period and this subject will certainly come up – meaning politicians will buy votes by promising more government freebies (subsidized insurance premiums). UNH and ATHM are my two favorites that I will buy on the next DIP. Your thought"
You cannot fight the selling robots
This should be close to $300 now...
adding on every dip
"I'm out! All the talk of repealing the ACA is just bad news, along with the Rx issues. The Optum division will see its analytic products lose demand from insurers that do participate in the ACA as it becomes less attractive to underwrite, and the PBM (OptumRx) wil see its profitability shrink. All that is left is the ho hum UNH management business... Not a pretty prospect."
"Another chance to get out early (sell high) but you must act now. Up at the open, then declining all day long. Seen this pattern many times."
"The market makers squeeze the weak hands out today, and hand it the big boys this afternoon. WSJ raises UNH to buy, and raise the price up another 9%."
CVS will go up?
Let's close above 301 today!!!
"Hey SID, BLUE, etc, can you try making ONE thread to post your comments on, instead of a separate one each time? That would be really cool."
"Remember Obama Care !! We thought that was the demise of insurances & stock tanks big time. Learn from history, don’t be so reactive to fake news!!"
Humana stock is much better. Next big down day on Humana I’m selling unh and going with Humana. People stupid enough to vote for Omar and Ellison and Franken are obvious fools and I would rather not invest in them
"Bloomberg's decision to run as a democrat is a major positive for the US stock market in general and UNH more specifically. A center democrat that supports big business and that doesn't want to expropriate everything from everybody, starting with billionaires, is a breath of fresh air in a democratic field populated by Marxists, socialists, Maoists and Chavismos. He will force the democratic field to actually show their math, rather than just mumbling under their breath and resorting to ""demsplaining and wealth-shaming"" in debates. This will push out the kooks and move the democrats back to the center. While Bloomberg might not win the nomination, and certainly is far from a lock even if he does, a pragmatic republican incumbent running against a pragmatic democrat spells good things for the stock market, all else being equal."
Downgrades and price action holds.
Bernie and the goofs did so great during the last election. They have less of a chance now. Why does anyone believe this garbage? Fake stories playing on people's emotions.
gil is MUTED
Will it $295 today. Will close at $290. Go Sleepy Joe!!!
This is due to Bernie's fake plan? The swiss cheese plan is a joke. People are so gullible.
I feel bad for the sheep that panicked and sold today. They will run this back up just as quickly.
What is UNH has to do with the china war??? Medicare for all would never happen!!
"low volume today, at this pace it may be 50% of normal average. Nobody wishing to sell here, UNH will be over 320 tomorrow."
Don’t be fooled by GS- pump and dump...just look at the chart on UHC
"I will buy into Jan 2019, because I believe that UNH is the king of health care sector."
"UNH is going down big because Bernie Sanders unveiled the details of his Medicare for All plan today. So if you are a Bernie or socialist supporter, UNH is probably not a good stock to be in your portfolio, unless you expect them to lose the 2020 election. You can't win both ways."
No buzz...surprised analysts are not touting UNH. Lots of momentum plays getting all the hype but this is where the investment is not only safe but grows. Should be in every portfolio. IMO
Entire market is insane
Hit me target of $240. I'm out. Done deal.
The left will destroy this stock if by chance they got in next year/ but at least everyone will get a participation trophy!!!i can’t even watch cnn for a second- it’s like I m living in an acid trip- and this reoccurring trip is impeachment talk on cnn! It’s so sad for them!!!
Shake out the weak. I still like quality. Keep trying!
Just loaded up on calls. Will see.
Good bye 230...Coming to 300...
"I expect UNH will reach 257-258 by this Friday. Then we will have July 4th, fireworks on next Tuesday morning."
"I want to see UNH hit 270 by July 17, then we will have champagne on Thursday morning. I expect to see UNH to hit 280+. UNH just raise dividends to $ 4.32 last month that proves that the company has confidence the sales will be higher and profit will be high enough to to cover the dividends. I remember that I bought UNH for $ 23 in 2011. UNH is the best undervalue stock in DOW,"
What is the news that takes this thing down 3%? Going to retest the $230s? Does UNH sell drugs? Is UNH affected by barrycare? Did not think so to either question.
I think everyone should short this stock till 214 and then buy back at 214. And hold till earnings
Pretty soon there gonna give this away... I’ll take every share
"Trump has nothing to do with big insurers doing better, it was ObamaCare!! 50% of health insurers exited paving the path. Remember the Co-Ops the government subsidized with hundreds of millions of tax dollars to counter this? They have all gone bankrupt!! Doubt this, look it up. In Obama’s state, iL., it was Land of Lincoln"
BUY IT NOW BEFORE IT BREAKS OUT. NEGATIVE NEWS ABOUT THE WHISTLE BLOWERS IS OUT OF MERIT BECAUSE UNH USES THE STANDARD CHARGE WHICH EVERY HEALTH CARE USES IT. UNH IS PREDICTABLE IN EVERY ASPECT.
"Go little guy, you can do it."
231 at close
Buffett Letter is out Saturday. Look for anything related to HC plans.
"Not too far off from $225. Another day or two of a decent rally past this big one will do it. Nish pointed out $160 by Friday, not likely"
"We already have healthcare for all if you are 65. That system is going broke. The entire health care universe has to be addressed and corrected.Other countries pay considerably less and have better healthcare than the US. 20 years ago h.c. was not a problem. What changed? Executive compensation and corporate governance. All aspects of the hc system in the US are overpriced: doctors, hospitals, drugs, equipment, technicians, elderly care, hospice, ER care, ...."
400 by the time spring birds are chirping.
Anyone know a good sell price on $unh? I've been holding it for years and am wondering if it's time to move on.
"Dividend Announced: ""UnitedHealth Group Board Authorizes Payment of Quarterly Dividend to Shareholders[Business Wire]Business Wire•February 27, 2019NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors, at its regular quarterly meeting, authorized payment of a cash dividend of $0.90 per share, to be paid on March 19, 2019, to all shareholders of record of UnitedHealth Group common stock as of the close of business on March 11, 2019."""
Wow that was a quick sell off
230 a sure thing. Just no buyers. When Dow is up 230 or up big then there is forced passive buying. When that is taken away with a down move on the Dow and SP500 this stock will crater like it did yesterday. Bet this stock closed red today
"Sold at $239 yesterday, now waiting until UNH gets slammed back to $220."
Should start running into earnings soon.
United health longs snookered by wall st pros...
UNH will do well no matter what DHT does with the ACA.
Dollar cost averaging down? huh? I own at 72. with may calls . huh?
Wow this is so hated
"When Jay Powell comes out and be more patient, UNH will roll back to 255 today I guarantee."
good entry
"Warren back up in the polls, expect this one to head back to 220 in no time"
what a buy !! wish had more $$$ people are really psychotic
I endorse UNH for its bright quarter and future!target $300 in 6 months!
Even with end of 2018 beatdown with the market Healthcare was top sector for 2018 and most analysts predict it will repeat in 2019.I I see 20% plus upside for UNH in 2019 to $300-320 range.
why is this struggling to stay green and CI up 2%?
UNH reached a 52 Week low at 213.60
$240 after earnings on Tuesday
Down yet another open. Wow the pattern is never ending
UNH has not seen a decent correction in 6 months now stochastics have not been oversold since October on the daily charts the 6 months is the longest it has gone without a correction of at least 5 % time will tell
Stay here this will hit 250.
"AAPL, TSLA...probably AMZN next. I see a 2-1 announcement coming Q3. Would be our 6th I believe."
Forward PE of 15 and over $14 in earnings.Keep selling please!! Rebate change will not affect earnings for UNH in the near term. Free for all medical not happening!!!!! More baby boomers going on Optum Medicare advantage every day. But up these cheap shares while they last.
HELL YEAH HELL YEAH HELL YEAH
Now it's back haha
"Third-quarter earnings reports from Aetna (AET) and UnitedHealth (UNH) showed that their combined exchange enrollment totals fell by 113,000 to 1.6 million from the end of June through September, a decline of 6.6%. Sunk amazed me the hype comes out the a fall begins."
"A regular occurence. December Swoon, February, April... and we are already in a month long decline so I suspect it will recover soon. It isn't the democrat polls per se, it's the legions of shorts that are playing it. This most recent decline is relatively low volume compare to recent selloffs. Use this opportunity to accumulate. It will recover and when it does, the shorts will cover."
Just entered my first position in UNH. Easy ride up to new highs
Moved my money to anthem and hum. Will buy puts on UNH right at the close 3:59 ish. Look at the time and sales data here are countless 1 and 2 share trades. I’m sorry this is a clown stock of it has hat many people flipping 1and 2 shares
I think we are finally seeing a hint of a defensive bid.. If we get a little April sunshine respite in the coronavirus onslaught and a nice conference call on April 14th Who knows? Maybe we’ll cross the $300 threshold again in five weeks
"It is the long term stock, it is not high tech, so be patient with it. It will go new high soon, because when you go see OPTUM, they are so busy, add Health Care Partner with it, even make it busier. They take market share from AET,HUM,ANTM."
Health care stocks are sinking overpriced UNH is on DECK !http://finance.yahoo.com/news/these-stocks-are-getting-whacked-after-the-gop-unveils-its-obamacare-replacement-161712523.html
Who sold at 228.59 today?! Sucks to be you!
Did not sell why??? I bought more today $216.00 lol
UNH is down 4.95% to 286.50
"RSI still low at 32, also ANTM raised long term earnings to 12-15% , both should be up today."
Question: where is this company going to get $25B for the 100M share buyback? More compounding debt?
$500 in May?
$UNH Target Raised by SVB Leerink Outperform USD 378 » USD 390
"Wow, this can do something besides go down, amazing."
"Democrats in power, free healthcare, no bueno"
"UNH now sees its 2019 rev below the low end of its original outlook of $243-245 bln due to the transition of Cigna PBM biz and UNH’s exit from Iowa Medicaid, partially offset by the DaVita Medical Group acquisition.Credit Suisse is leaving it's 2019/2020 EPS estimates basically unchanged. So the outlook is still solid. But...........UNH along with the other health insurers will be exposed to headline risk due to the presidential campaigns on the Dem side. It has made a great comeback since $ fled the stock a few months ago but fear, albeit irrational, still surrounds the group."
holding. not buying or selling
"My dad told me to buy the great stock when it is down a lot like UNH. I check the news on web site, I did not see any thing, I start to buy May 245 to bet on that UNH will beat the #$%$ out of the estimate."
"Oh good, the Three Stooges will solve healthcare for us...Just like they fixed leak in the bath tub...lol"
I think UNH is growing well. ANTM even grow faster and its cheaper than UNH
lol it has no support or buyers at any price. Not 240 not 230 not 225 not 223.23. Not 220 not 215 not 200. Elizebeth Warren going to #$%$ this company down
they charged so high on drugs
Seems to me despite no success repealing the ACA to date (other than GOP sabotage effecting the exchanges) UNH will be exposed to constant headline risk as Repubs attempt to take away insurance (and Medicare/Medicaid) from as many people as possible while they are in power. Not seeing any changes to EPS estimates but sentiment may shift under the continuous threat of the GOP's efforts in making healthcare less available.
Wow! Bernie must feel good. Looks like more people fear him more than the deadly coronavirus!
This will go up from here ? Any idea about price tomorrow?

put in buy at reg price anyway
"So, the CEO shoots his mouth off and tanks the entire sector. I though Cordani was bad, but this guy takes the cake...."
"This is pitiful!!! Other stocks especially tech are up big, UNH is just swinging between red and green. If the market is down, goes down also! If the market is up, UNH still down.."
"Very nice to get in early when ANH downed over 8 points, I never thought that UNH will be punished this bad because of the light revenue. The earnings beats 15 cents plus the excellent capital management. If ROE over 30% is not good enough, I don't know which health care company can do."
"This stock has a .7 beta, which means it should correlate with the market with less gyrations. The movement over the past several months has been the exact opposite of this metric. Regardless of what the market does, UNH goes down. This sucks!"
This stock is a living hellll
unfortunately I own a stock. I do not have a choice but to stay long. the future overall for United Healthcare does not look right. Wall Street does not like uncertainty. United Healthcare is in the middle of all the turmoil either from president Trump Republican Party or Bernie Sanders and then democratic party. none of the scenarios look good until the end of the elections. my opinion is that there is a further downside forthe stock. big institutional holders will try to sell it on any single pop
clueless why this dog is still going down.....
Are UNH and Cigna is different businesses? Lol. Is Cigna no longer an hmo? Lol Because here is no correlation between the two stocks whatsoever
Big boys buy a lot of UNH in the morning. It seems that they want some more.I think we will see by the close.
The market abhors UNCERTAINTY. That is the issue here.
The selling is massive and in waves. This will be known as the elizebeth Warren panic
Bye bye
"Agreed ignoring the noise, officially in bear territory. Just added large position at 218"
UNH’s down is only in the short term. In the long term it’s still a win and outperformance
"I’m sure that 90% of you realize this, but, for now, UNH (and the rest of the hmo sector) is like an anchored sailboat swinging wildly in the political winds. The pre-debate drop followed by the post debate pop says it all. It will gyrate wildly for the next 6 months as the Dems choose their champion.. Then, I expect the dem candidate, whoever it is, to rush for the political center... That should ease the pressure on UNH somewhat over summer and fall.. Then if the dem wins, all bets are off.. Last November, even with the Dems winning congress Unh kept rising and it peaked in December 2018... then the political drumbeat for single payer took it down ...The existential political threat of single payer has reared its head twice before, under Hillary care (something like a 90% drop) and under Obamacare (about a 75% price drop) Those events were followed by amazing price rises... but I’m sure that fears of similar price falls are the real issue here.. So, this really isn’t a falling knife.. it’s a wait and see game .. If warren gets the nomination it will be a rough ride.. But if trump prevails and the political clouds clear.. this stock will be awesome, probably bumping $400 in 2021.. Even if Warren wins the election Unh will still be a going concern, they are a key healthcare provider as well as an hmo.. but it will be a messy thing stretching on for years."
This thing is going to hover in the low 200s till early next year when Bernie or Elizabeth win Iowa. That’ll cause a 40 point drop and send this to 150s.
Socialized healthcare - that's all you need to know. If the Dems win in 2020 - it will crater all these providers
Downgraded to sell?
UNH will not suffer if the ACA is repealed. They stayed away from it from the beginning.
next...$270
Fear of Warren is fading.
UNH is down 7% since open.
"This is just the HC sector... wait until the broader market, or other market segments start to sell off. Going to be a bloodbath. Keep at least 50% in cash is my advice. Semis are next."
Shouldn't UHN have announced their Q1 dividend by now? Prior years it was announced before mid-February.
I consider this a trading vehicle now. I bought 2 $220 April 19 calls at the open for the earnings bounce. Haven't made up my mind whether I'll hold them overnight.
"Wow, it's acting like a bum stock for sure. Go the other way.."
"Avoid the noise and stick with the facts and the facts are they not only beat estimates, they RAISED its profit guidance for the year!

"FIRE JERRI DOBY case manager Phx Az ,,, fire this woman right NOW ,,, member ID ...... 113824893-00 / D.O.B 11/06/1965 DROP ALL SHARES !!!! sell out all holdings !!!!"
cmon sheep doctors offices are closed elective surgeries are not allowed so like the auto insurers where is the give back on the monthly premiums!!!-what is AARP doing about this-let me see how many thumbs up and then we will take action
Well i definitely bought this way too early at 227$. It’s fine though ill wait it out a long time
"Buy it if you want....I just did for first time , but be prepared to hold for a while. The stock will recover, patience is the operative word here."
GREEEN
Wishes come true! All upside from here!
There is no benefit to holding this. I dumped this pos today when it went up and stalled. There is no reason to hold this underperforming bad of feces
"Love produces only children, not the money from the stock! :-)"
$5.50 off the high. Just astonishing.
Will never even think of voting for Bernie or any other demo with ideas like theirs they are just stupid
Buy low and sell high!!!
Going green
Let's see if Minnesota will vote democrat in 2020
It's truly unbelievable looking at the 5 year 10 year chart on this incredible
Former ceo ori karev now at prpo .just announced news for gloabal strategy
It will go 40 dollars up
"K Harris was a big proponent of Medicare FA...She had no clue about what that actually entailed. Just a popular topic in some circles that she thought would get her the nomination. Biden a big Obamacare guy. Let’s hope , if Joe wins, he can hang mentally tough and they don’t have to lead him out of the White House."
Don't believe that SCOTUS will repeal Obamacare automatically with the new justice.
I bought some early in the day.
People r buying this
Wow! Just wow! What a magnificient stock!
Wonderful news for the largest health care company! Especially the President of the company taking a leave of a absence to help WHO in this crisis. Good Public relations
"Monster stock to own for long term. Best of the breed along with V, MA, HD"
watch out the wolves(shorts) will be here soon ...I sold my shares...good luck
If Burn ie wins whole Econ in serious trouble
"Some of my individual drug stocks are getting hurt even worse. AMGN, etc. These companies have big rebate programs which I think is more the reason for the downside with the WH touting putting an end to these. Just a lot of FUD and not earnings concerns."
Thank heaven for UNH! I’m taking it on the chin in the broader market but my largest holding is keeping me above water....
AARP is blasting you again. Stupid is as stupid does. many are realizing this group is a liberal hack group and you continue to be associated with them. Good luck with that strategy.
"according to max pain, $242.50 is the target...."
Dang sold off at 234. Hedge funds manipulating it.
"pulling the truck, betting the house"
Being a Democrat and owning healthcare stocks is kind of like being Je.wish and supporting Hitler...
"Lots of ""experts"" here on the board lately, Johnny come latelies."
Yahoo why are you deleating my posts?
Is it possible UNH will test 255 by tomorrow? Jay Powell already gave back everything he got to the market. I thing the best stock right now there are about less than 10. UNH. AAPL IN DOW 30. FB and GOOG both in NASDAQ 100.
no politics here . just wanna make money... i hate all politicians equally.what happened to all the bears ? .. My cost is $228.80 enjoying the ride.I'm staying in it for the long term.
"Funny thing has happened, the retail sector got no scratch at all, but health care suffers big time instead of going green today among the fluctuate rate."
With blue wave should I sell UNH now?
Big acquisition but appears we overpaid
Witty at the helm? Seems like an odd transition...his track record at gsk was terrible  and fined 3B for payin docs to prescribe scheme...this is a headscratcher
"The short sale volume percent (not short interest) for stock ticker UNH is 59% on Feb 11, 2021. The short sale volume is 654,874. The total volume is 1,107,957. The short sale volume percent is up 15% compare to Feb 10, 2021."
Check out the chart. Strong double-bottom pattern from March 2018.. We are at a 52 week low. This is when the stock took off last year.
"Technically trading very well since off the double bottom at 234-235's with positive crossover on the stochastics, relative strength gaining, and macd approaching positive crossover...and enjoy the dividends."
Who bought today at 299.64? Sucks to be you!
"Yay, healthcare sector going back up. Get on board."
Playing this daily oversold game again. This will run back up into close. I'm thinking at least $219 before the bell.
So Cramer said to buy at this price right? Gonna see it green today?
I will never vote for any democrat because of today’s action
"The MARKET PUNISHES CVS as a retail pharmacy, as a PBM and now as an HEALTH INSURER.The MARKET REWARDS CVS FOR NONE OF THESESSDD PATTERNN SINCE JULY 2015"
Yesterday and today's pre-market was a classic dead cat bounce. Oh boy.
"Something is wrong for this stock. It is someone who tries to suppress it. Let's see at the close,of we are in red. we are in trouble on Tuesday. I still believe that the market makers need to hand someone big block, that is why the price is Yo-Yo, which I never seen before for this stock."
hoping to end today above 247.5
Unh will be up at $320 on Wednesday am
And another reason this stuff can happen is fund managers just aren’t very smart. I mean sure they sound smart and use jargon and focus on 1000 variables that are useless. Actually makes them quite stupid. So how do they compete? Side deal and manipulation because they can’t invest or trade fair up. This is why they all do what they do. Watch fast money a few weeks and notice how they are just guessing and wrong as much as they are right. All their big sophisticated talk is just them trying to sound smart. Idiots
UnitedHealth is down 4.92% to 292.88
Unh has a very weak shareholder base
Not good waiting $150.00 few months from now.
Blame Bernie with his sh@@y ideas about a company with 300000 employees guess he will lose major votes for this plus seniors up in arms
No choice; It's got to go up!
"I first bought UNH when Trump went after ACA the first time around at $190. Proved to be a good decision. It is extremely hard to change anything in healthcare. Even if we were to have Medicare for all one day, UNH would be okay. The large health insurance companies already run Medicare, the government just pays for it. Plus you'd have Medicare advantage plans too (you've probably seen the UNH ads for it on TV) because Medicare only pays 80% of your healthcare costs."
it's on sale today boys BUY BUY BUY!
Reaction to Democrats debate. Medicare for all not gonna happen. UNH up.
let's close at at least 320 today!
Waste of time to be long this stock
"is this company going bottomsup, like the largesttravel agency in the world did??"
UNH is a Buffet style buy right now. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4255075-unitedhealth-great-
240 to 246 in the next few days should set the bottom. IMHO
still a good entry point or too late? thinking to open a position. PE is still low at 23.75.
Don't worry. Bernie's not getting elected.
bernie sanders had zero chance of becoming president
"Does any feel the Bern yet? Sorry, just adding a little Levity"
Pulling out of Obamacare could be their best decision. Many of the carriers have pulled out and there is a reason for that.
I feel like regardless of what happens..UNH can't get a break
The heat map of the health care sector of S&P 500 looks like an inferno.
UNH reached a new All Time High at $285.28
Might even go green today.
Total hysteria
Time to buy WBA
UNH has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. if you guys have questions you should ask awe-someSTOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
Heheh that’s what I said
relatively benign day for a big dump the market is taking

"Very pricy and over bought, COVID is still here"
Just cruising this last week and this week
CI and CNC are the best duo second to UNH.
"There is no doubt the current US healthcare system is heavily flawed. Americans spend twice as much as any other advanced country in the world for mediocre and uneven results. However, it seems that Elizabeth Warren's Medicare for All has a few gaping holes in it. First of all we are talking about nationalizing about 20% of the US economy. Not sure that is something for this country. Also, what happens to the two million employees of healthcare insurance companies that will be out of a job. That is not to mention the companies themselves, such as UNH and the stockholders of all these companies. On top of that if there is only one healthcare system all the technology platforms and companies that drive them out there will be out of business too. Same story on their employees and the companies themselves. Also, cutting the cost of drugs from pharma companies by as much as 70% is bound to have a large negative impact on them. To accomplish this massive shift to a national healthcare system it would take a generation of shift as this could not happen in a short time frame. There are many more areas that would also be impacted that Elizabeth Warren has not addressed with her plan. On top of that it is probably impossible to get her plan through congress."
"UNH will be back to 255 may be by Friday when investors closely look at the number. particularly ROE, because the company knows how to leverage the cash flow really well. UNH beats the craps the whole health care sector because of the size and capital management. Holy cow, how can UNH dropped over 10 points this morning, which I can't believe my eyes."
"Maybe it is the same virus that took Celgene down. Analysis, politics, board or prez. of the company?"
I bought this new position today. I think its going to be a good ride up
"We've had a good week with over three days of upward momentum that qualifies in my book as a rally. I would normally recommend sell the rally, but we are nowhere near the last top in the 270's when I made that recommendation. Still, with a basis of 239 and a short term gain of 5%, I am feeling the need to at least lighten up, but waiting to see how the market settles out today. Early in the day yet."
It will never happen. Hold on
Biden had a good night...UNH to have a good day today...Go Sleppy
What I like here is how it’s positioned to take advantage of the ability $UNH and $WMT have in the business. EASYDOUBLE
It's not a true rally until the other health insurers participate. They aren't.
Giddy up
down every fn day
Should be back to new highs Bernie will lose big time too radical
"UNH is an undervalued giant. Given their most recent earnings report and the continued shut down happening again, this stock will be $400-$600 by the end of the year. Hope more shorts get squeezed so it'll go up higher and higher!!!"
Goes down on good news .
"UNH- over bought, elective surgeries are still down"
"The days of Big Health Care is over. Trump doesn't like fat cats in the drug and health care organized crime racket making so much money on the back of people needing health care and his plan when revealed will put a stop to it. The worst thing UNH could do is have an earnings report restating the obvious: They are making way too much money on those needing health care. They should have sandbagged. They are going down, a slow stutter step down for many years."
