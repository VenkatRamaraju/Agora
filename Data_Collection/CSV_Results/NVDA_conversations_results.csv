Recent headlines and conversations for NVDA
Someone correct me if I am wrong. I always see people on this board calling NVDA a chipmaker. But it is my understanding that NVDA does not make any chips. They buy the chips to produce their graphics cards
$nio is being a real competitor now if you looking to the new features.#The new battery range #The new model with the new features.#7x better then Tesla’s computer#Better cameras + lidar(Camera’s tesla 3mp while nio is going for 8mp)#partnership with $NVDA#Cheaper priced sedan then Tesla #new battery swap stations are x3 effecient#500+ more swapping stations in 2021Did i forget something ?
Nvidia reported quarterly earnings of $3.10 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $2.81 by 10.32 percent. This is a 64.02 percent increase over earnings of $1.89 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $5.00 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $4.82 billion by 3.80 percent. This is a 61.13 percent increase over sales of $3.10 billion the same period last year
I predict NVDA will be unchanged on Monday but.......a 10% market correction is inevitable. I am 100% in cash as of tonight in my trading account.
"willtori1 you haven't answer my question, the new leader undervalued AMD is worth $300?"
going up there with the Mars rover.
The weekly 540 put options are up 95% today! NVDA still $615????
After Hours games makes you sick. Buy @ 460 and incremental down every 50$ to 300. Rinse and repeat. 1000 dollar is years away. Buy at lower and take the opportunity to go to 600 later.
WHAT is going on? Now up 30..... what news is creating this? Or is a hedge fund running things up just to cash out.
"Hey  longs, maybe if the NASDAQ goes to 100,000 you can break even $589 buy"
Simmer down shorts this will open green...short more if you think it red on Thursday
if this was such a terrible ER why is AMD and INTC only down pennies? Not like AMD had better ER then NVDA...no doubt this moves back over $600 this week...big boys shaking the trees to get the weak hands shares
Just keep buying the dip with your fake Monopoly money 
Every other stock is up in pre-market except meme stocks. 600calls: Worthless. How long out does YOUR calendar go?
"I sold my last NVDA at $555 almost 2 weeks ago and it shot up to $615. I never felt bad about the trade. I have a buy order at $480, hope it fills tomorrow."
"Oh Kevin Sir, where are your famous what time Red queries?Must have found your answer in all Your Red Shorts!!! "
"@LarryTheLegend you have predicted NVDA being down $50 nearly everyday it has gone down. at the rate you keep saying it, NVDA should be $300 right now. just stop"
$504!!! Yessssss yessssss finally yesssss how many times did I tell you
To the MOON!!!
"I have a friend who runs a lot of money for MS he got clients into NVDA middle of last year, almost all of those clients fired him because of it"
Nvidia is where shorts go to die. Green.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
Any institution buys TSLA will accumulate NVDA... why worry...Lol
"Good thing everyone will stop gaming, using computers, cell phones and the internet, while also losing all interest in self driving electric vehicles and crypto post pandemic."
Also for those of you who are not able to understand german language - this video declares a lot of #Nvda success and future expectations. Watch it from minute 13:00. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Ja9T5O4Wg
Do you think the price now is good for long term entry ?
"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a dominant player in the gaming GPU market, and its competitive position is only going to get better, according to an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.The Nvidia Analyst: Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy rating and $650 price target for Nvidia.The Nvidia Thesis: Mosesmann is positive on the opportunities that lie ahead for Nvidia, including a recurring revenue stream from Auto, data center inferencing and gaming, following the company's ""Virtual Fireside Chat"" with Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress. Automotive is likely to be the strongest catalyst, and the company could announce more partnerships with Automotive OEMs over the course of the year, the analyst said.n the strategically important data center compute part of the business, Nvidia is likely to continue to gain share, as this market turns away from CPUs and toward GPUs.""With the recent release of the low-end GeForce RTX GPU, Nvidia has a hand in all parts of the gaming market, and we believe will continue to see strong demand,"" the analyst wrote in the note.Nividia is the best managed and strategically positioned semiconductor company, said the analyst, with secular growth prospects driven by AI, gaming, and Automotive in the long run.HOLD that information all those who want to short NVDA"
Just how bad did NVDA Miss earnings by to fall $110
NVDA = FSLY down 40% in a week
$517 to $511 in less than a minute. This stock is less stable than GME
"As predicted by me it ended higher today and it will go to $1,000 so stay strong and stay invested"
NASDAQ IS BLOWING UP. INVEST/TRADE ACCORDINGLY.I AM A BUYER AT THESE LEVELS AND BELOW AS MUCH AS I CAN ACCUMULATE.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
Everything turning green. Warned TSLA Nvda Aapl
"As expected, another day another gain as NVDA rebounds from the flash correction."
Anyone forget to sell $582 quadruple top formation when I begged them
"Time to add NVDA and Nio (before NIO starts moving to $100) and watch both grow. Autonomous driving requires advanced chippers. NIO developing the high end tech to push TSLA and NVDA developing the AI for autonomous EVs. Amazing that real AI is one year a way.NIO doing ""Autonomous Driving as a Service"". Another monthly revenue stream that can make getting high car cheaper. In a few years, I imagine Nio owners will be able to recover that cost by deploying their car as a Robitaxi while the owner works at their desk. Then the car can return to pick up the owner at the end of workday. NIO and NVDA are making the future tech that others will have to chase. Eventually, Uber and Lyft might be done while Nio and Tesla replace them and a portion of other public transportation in a few short years... yielding more revenue for NVDA and Nio."
Where is Needhams Rajvinder Gill. Has he been fired or something. We need him to come on CNBC and raise his price target from $800 to $900.
Arm deal not looking good so far. Will price drop if ARM deal definitely doesn't go through? Just asking.
senator passed stimulus..but Nasdaq doesn't look good....ndva continues moving downwardly.
When I read 100  consecutive posts in here how NVDA is going to $1000 I knew the end was near
Long but don't expect much from the ER....too much negativity about big tech. Anyone got the whisper numbers?
"you know it....huang came out on Cramer and said "" a buying opportunity""....of course that was $70 north of here. I watched Cramer do that with the ""race to twelve"" with DYN years ago. Popped and went bankrupt. He hides in some good calls while he scams the world with his banking buddies. Is he'll to hot for folks like that?"
Almost back to Fridays lows $467 should hit $299 by next week
"NVDA $615 to $545 in two weeks!NVDA was $545 two earnings reports ago and they blew out both earnings! “If a stock doesn’t go up on great news, it’s going down.”"
Well it all went better until Powell went on air. Patience is a virtue.
I honestly don’t understand how NVDA is still this high $477???
How’s choochoo train Boy doin today? Has he left the station? 
NVDA will be under $500 tomorrow Anyone want to bet???
Benzinga poll: only 22% thinks nvidia will grow faster than intel/amd. Seriously? Nvidia is positioned in more fields and these are booming. AMD/INTc's bread and butter remains x86 territory and we all know how that is evolving (apple eg).
"Tax hike news hit yet? Doesn't seem like it. Even if the taxes on the wealthy and LLCs were at 100% year-over-year it would only pay for a small fraction of the first stimulus package, let alone the second or third. I'm guessing everyone else is getting their taxes jacked up next once they realize tax revenues aren't cutting it. I don't mind paying a bit more in taxes if it means good (well thought out) social programs but I have a feeling it's just going to end up looking like California where the taxes are through the roof but everything is still out of control."
NVIDIA reached an all time high at 602.37
Will close down $50 today. Stocks never do well down $80 into earnings ever! Ask FSLY shareholders. I abused that stock at $122 now $69 in a week!
NVDA just announced new non gaming chip specific for crypto mining
Looks like back to 600+ today
to the 
Going to 550 tomorrow and 600 on coming Monday. It's an expensive stock. Will never go under 500 in our livetime
OK  let’s ask for Monday: WHAT TIME RED ? 9:30  am EST
Talking about a coiled spring!
CRAMER JUST SAID NVDA COULD DOUBLE IF ARM IS ACQUIRED
Now she’s firmly under her 200 day MA so feel free to ride to 299. Anyone not short $487 is beyond insane
"The 13,000 call options bought today @ $600 are all R.I.P. trust me"
great buying opp. on the dip
"Do you longs feel violated yet? If not, you will soon enough. ""Value"" is in favor now. Value stocks are stocks with no earnings, high debt that grow at 3% per year. Why do you want to own growth now? Don't fight the tape. Sell semiconductors because as you know semiconductors are no longer needed and there is a huge glut of chips so many in fact they are filling football stadiums with unsold chips. Get out and save whatever dignity and money you have remaining!!!!!"
Remember when Kevin told you to short 467 
What drops quicker?(1) Prom dresses after prom night(2) NVDA stock daily
"I am not gonna lie, bought @ 578 now I am apparently stuck for a couple of years here."
The bottom line is huang doesn’t have a clue
$519+ still not near a PC $463 this week 100%
Nothing goes straight down 615 to 460 is a start next leg is 299
Hey all...just out of curiosity why buy this stock? Or even short it? Why put money in this when ur can buy cheaper stocks that soar 50 to 100 percent?? I just dont get it? 11million shares traded on this security ...alit of money
"all i know is, i had a chance to turn 5k into 10ml on two trades in 4 days i got one leg but missed the whopper down leg with nvda repeatedly getting capped at 555x area nvda 500p shot up 8,000% in 3 days as nvda divebombed from 555x to sub 470but i did pull the trigger on calls at the sub 470 washout lows and paid off big time 500c shot up 2,500% in 3.5hrs"
"If NVDA is going to $700, $1000....you better load up at $595. Who is buying today and who is praying today ?"
An immediate V back to $600...
"While many of the industry's partnerships are not publicly known, Navigant Research claims that ""virtually every company” involved in self-driving technology utilizes NVIDIA in some way. This includes Toyota, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, VW, ZF, Continental, Kenworth, and Peterbilt… NVIDIA claims over 370 partners with some involvement."
"Free-DUMB 615 to 495 = 120 x 6500 shares = WOW  $800,000 loss in just NVDA in a week"
"NVDA could be over $700 after its E/R next week as BITCOIN hit all time new record high today $52,000....Like TESLA bought 1.5 billion in bitcoins....which give NVDA a high boost ahead nvda 's e/r....TSLA 'S BEEN OVER $4500 / SHARE and so NVDA COULD BE at least soon $1500 this year.....BUY MORE....ON DIP TODAY AS A GREAT BARGAIN...GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITIES TODAY...."
Total market manipulation using the 10 year yield as an excuse! Powell said rates staying here! Oh well
Nvidia chip is a HUGE dinosaur. Intel Xe is a new sleek design with chiplets. The future in graphics is Intel.
"Kevin Sir, what time is Vipul serving us drinks? "
"Shares are rising, they must be talking about this at reddit."
NVDA $615 to $540 in a week and earnings have passed (-$50 earnings day) R.I.P.  DOA

"HUANG ceo just sold 24,000,000 550"

Go long at these levels for sure.
"February 1st NVDA closed at $527. Earnings were really good, guidance wasn’t bad considering chip shortages will continue another quarter or two and the Entire market is down BIG today. Nothing has changed. Congrats to the shorts that finally caught a temporary break. NVDA will continue to lead the future in technology."
"I don't know why everyone thinks stocks always go up.Infact look at amazon.... is it a bad company? No its not.... stocks don't always go up. It's healthy for the stock to consolidate and make a new low. Everything great is worth waiting for. Nothing easy in life lasts a long time. Sleep great , have a great life NVDA Longs you are invested in the best future growth company."
"So here we are again, another Friday, another day those 600 calls are expiring worthless. I shorted these calls for as far as the calendar goes. The Mayans calendar ran out, and so will the Gregorian and Julian calendars, before my shorts on the 600 calls. Some of those calls are decaying from $96 per contract. They down to 6. I’m not to worried or do you think nvda will have a 25% day today (can someone explain that to the options book kid? His memer thing breaks right about “in the money”)"
Did the CEO die during the conference call??
"AHs today, Apple close to contract with Hyundai Kia for Apple car in 24/25. Nvidia and Hyundai already in agreement for AI in Hyundai cars. If Nvidia gets into Apple car, more long term upside as Auto continues to build for Nvidia."
Last March NVDA fell 60%That takes it to $250 I will cover and go long there With tight stops
NVIDIA is up 5.48% to 489.15
dont worry it will end higher today. Thanko
Hahahahahaha! ....Kyle9 days agoNVIDIA CorporationOut. Be back at 515
"Great day for NVDA! Up until 2021 I had 100% of my 'cash' in NVDA (500 shares), but everyone kept telling me to diversify, so I sold 10% of my NVDA shares at $555 and bought some NIO and GEVO (both breaking even after a month and bought some BNGO today. For some reason I feel like I'm cheating on my girlfriend (NVDA) which continues to run up. What am I to do?? I probably should have just put that 10% in Apple or Microsoft or a long term stable company....I've lost thousands and thousands in speculative stocks over the years. Maybe I'll just sell the 10% and buy back NVDA...."
QQQs just lost $300.
"no sign of tech sales slowing down, earnings reports up in 14 days. Nvidia is selling all they can. Also: do shorts even know the arm take over is pending? Doubt it. You can shove your TA where the sun never shines when it happens."
NVDA Price Target $700
"this stock ALWAYS goes down the next day. if you people haven't figured that out yet I don't know what to tell ya. BUY more.. 1,000 by end of the year."
“ONLY” $102 more dollars and NVDA longs will be even from two weeks ago

BUY THE MARKET DIPS! GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!
575 to 570 in literally one second. Not a stable stock. Nice cheap run  will be 460 in two weeks
10 year under 1.50 next week and NVDA over $525. As simple as that.
"Slashing GDP growth by the day is peak “woke”, I wonder which children’s author gets sent to the gulag next?"

Looking at $480 after earnings tonight. Oh No !
Cheap shares ahead.... won't last.
Kevin gets is arxx handed over on Monday bottom is in. I hope it drops further but changes are minor.
My INTC up again NVDA was twice INTC market capNow even
AMD INTC QCOM all chip companies are R.I.P. they can’t produce them fast enough demand is too high BUT what you can’t produce you can’t sell which is just as bad a no demand. That’s why AMD and NVDA haven’t moved a penny in almost 7 months. Supply constrained you will hear it 1000x when NVDA falls 12% like QCOM
me waiting on earnings
Wish had more cash !!This gem is definitely undervalued
"I told you all 1000x it’s February/March like last year, NVDA could easily fall 50% in a week"
Picture this You are in the lobby of an exclusive hotel and a young porter come through with an announcement for Kevin.DIAPERS FOR KEVIN DIAPERS FOR KEVIN MR KEVIN YOUR DIAPERS ARE HERE
"Weeeeeee! Just remember, the only people that get hurt on roller coasters are the ones who jump off at the bottom. Sit back and enjoy the steady ride back up to the top "
I think Kevin will have to return his Bugatti
analysts were expecting next quarter guidance to be 4.5 Billion but NVDA guidance was 5.3 Billionwhich means they will do 5.5 Billion
Don't forget NVDA bagdolders conference is scheduled for tomorrow. Pls bring u r won coffee n chair. Thanks again !!I wish u good luck.

Most absurd forever high? AMZN $1600 NFLX $600 NVDA $615 $TSLA $902 $PYPL $309 CRWD $250???? I say NVDA $615 easily
"a week before earnings with nvda at 615 i was speculating if nvda would tag 650 on earnings beat and raiseand then, nvda got the whack a mole treatment no worriesnvda is a must own"
Awesome 5 year chart. So much of what we do requires their chips. They are way ahead of other chip makers with no chance of slowing down.
Lower price for a freedom to average in! 
Nvidia's chip is a HUGE monolith dinosaur. The future is Intel's Xe at 42 TFLOPS and a sleek brand new chiplet design.
Big players still shaking weak hands by keeping price low. my opinion.
NASDAQ could fall 1000 tomorrow morning at this rate would be down 20% this week

I actually finally feel really sorry for the longs in here. They have to honestly be on the verge of jumping
Gee what’s that? Oh just ANOTHER opening selloff -$6!!! Lock up huang
No longer does great earning mean anything......day traders would rather pay their 35% in taxes
"I love when shorts troll a great company to drive the price down. I accumulate more and more shares at a discount. Dominating chips in the most explosive market segments: Gaming, AI, 5G, Data Centers, Crypto. One day, BA-BOOM!!!!! 900+!!!!!"
Super Deal day at the NVDA Grocery Market!! =)
Let’s get this down $50 before earnings. Come on now let’s band together. How are those once again bloated 600 call options looking
"Mention bidon in a post, 100% guarantee of beeing delete. So much for free speech!!!?!"
That’s it 25th short in NVDA (have not covered one share) $541 here! What a gift 
Poor shorts. GOOG should take us higher tomorrow.
Imagine shorts if NVDA goes up over 16% after releasing better than expected ER like ITRI did this morning
I would love 2 see a stock split like apple !!!!! I do see good chance this year $$$$$$$$$
When NASDAQ fell 300 NVDA fell $40 now NASDAQ is up 300 and NVDA is up $16. 
Bullish on NVDA. But I think this may pull back to $454 short term.
Hope Kalpesh shows up to cheerlead!!!!
NVDA will be down $50 again one day this week guaranteed
Actually today is NVDA best day in a month only down $15
What in hell has caused the run-up to 571? ARE WE ON REDDIT?!!
I hope it's a $40 to $50 move to the upside to cover the unnecessary decline after the earnings report and $10 or so more above that. It is possible because NVDA has a red hot future.
Fantastic week to be a Nvidia long. Woo-Hoo..!!!

NVDA only stock I ever saw  that drops  $50 a day regularly BUT only goes up maybe  $5 on a huge market up day!
If 515 holds then Nvidia will be fine. Otherwise we are headed lower...
"Nvidia hardly lasts more than a day of increase. No offense to any longs, but it's a fact. The only way to play this is to sell when high and buy back when low. Unlike KevinTheLoser who only shorts and loses every short."

This stock is going to $1000. Even the Federal Government want to buy more chips as per the article I read a few days back . A car needs two big things to run an engine and a transmission. An artificial intelligence etc needs chips or semiconductors to run. Everything else is build around this to come up with a great product. These products almost always 100% makes our lives better in millions of different ways. I can list at least 500 of them. I am very confident about the growth of the entire semiconductor sector and NVIDIA will play a great part in this great expansion
SAVE THIS POST———-> NVDA $544 is the #1 short in the history of any stock market in any part of the world ever

Hey and why fall today they report good earnings
Pulled back after a great ER and now Nasdaq is up over 200 points. Who bought the dip? We know the people who missed out again. lol
"$555, I am out....order to buy 200 shares at $519. Easy money."

"My “firm” does a lot of research and a lot of “digging” when we began shorting NVDA last year over $580, we saw an opportunity and took it. Intel will eventually blow NVDA out of the water again like usual. NVDA will be under $300 and INTC will be $100+"
BUY BEFORE $600
"Bye  bye  $550, it’s been nice  knowing you. Does anyone in here have any clue on how to read an options chart?"
NVDA was recently twice the market cap of INTC. They will be even in a month. Anyone see INTC MU WDC three chip makers at 52 week highs
Tomorrow another $40 down
was it something related to the forecast with gaming being the big chunk of the first quarter?
I HOPE SOME OF YOU BOUGHT SHARES YESTERDAY LIKE I ADVISED DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN. ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO REGULARLY ADD SHARES ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN AND TO ADD MORE DURING MARKET DROPS. ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!

You have to be beyond insane to hold NVDA into earnings! Has any stock gone higher after earnings other than NFLX? Just buy the 600 weekly puts for the next 10 weeks
David Tepper says 10 year has topped out and ranged bound 1.3-1.6. Very bullish on stocks

Afterall its a 6% quarterly revenue growth only...? Also another 6% expected for next quarter. Would it be too greedy to expect double digit growth for an overvakued stock?
NVDA is broken. Pls be safe before 336. It's going to break 472 again. No reason to invest in this. NVDA leads the semis down. Watch it out. $336.
Bought this winner and sold with nice profit. Then bought a full position AGAIN when fell to $175 a share.Haven't sold a share since $175....
"That’s it, shorting $495 here cover $299. Save this post"

i was hoping for little pullback for healthy sustained rise over long period of time.
Seems there is a little softness in the stock today. Is Nvidia still a viable company? Maybe dividend cut and reverse split are next?

Decent support @ $550. Was $589 over 7 months ago. HORRIBLE manipulated stock BUT great company.
NVDA earning is around the corner and it is very good. NVDA has taken up business with Amazon and partnered with NIO. NVDA has also taken most business with China's electric cars. NVDA stock will sky rocket to over 590$. Its a must buy.

NIO partners with Nvidia on next-gen vehicle tech. NIO says it will use Nvidia's Drive Orin system-on-a-chip for it's new generation for it's electric and autonomous vehicles. This on top of ARM acquisition sets up Nvidia quite nicely for the future. As I said weeks ago this stock will reach a 1000.00 and definitely a favorite in the chip industry going forward in 2021.

Be totally  % honest with me. Any longs in here just a little bit frustrated with NVDA stock performance since August?
"Nvidia will be at $1,000 in 1 to 2 years if it doesn't split! take it to the bank!"
"I started thinking how does Nvidia come out with new products so fast that give like 50X jump in performance. I have been in sales and marketing for 25 years and have never seen a company like this. How do they do that???Here is how, if u spent $25 billion in AI development (software writing software) over 10 years and u are the leader in building super computers. this leads to a new product machine. That is the reason why I think Nvidia is the smartest company in the world . Some people think of Nvidia as a semiconductor company but this really is a new product machine with the fastest and smartest supporting cast around."
Would you rather own a SPAC or NVDA? I would say the latter. Money will gravitate towards quality and not towards pure speculation.
"NVDA and autonomous driving is going to be huge....From this article: ""NVIDIA's latest Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs) -- provides the computing horsepower needed to rapidly process data from lidar, radar, and cameras and run the deep neural networks that allow the car to move autonomously.""When it comes to AI, NVIDIA's best-in-class GPUs significantly outperform Intel's chips. And NVIDIA's industry-leading solution has helped the company attract dozens of partners, from start-ups to established enterprises. These include automakers Toyota, Audi, Volvo, and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz; mobility service providers like Airbus, Aurora Mobile, and Zoox."""

It seems like it was just yesterday..I bought my first 100 shares of NVDA.Jensen Huang was selling graphic cards out of the trunk of his Datsun back in those days. I didn't know what the fff a graphic card was back then....but I sure am glad I held those shares.
"the slacker mindset has gotten so obsceneso coddled and enabled at every turn by a multi-billion dollar disability complex with it's own vested interests that 80% of the homeless now are on ssi/ssdi disability to further fuel their downward spiral into severe drug/alcohol addictions and turn downtowns into a wasteland of over-indulged addicts yet veteran drug and street counselors say the best thing to do is cut off the money supplynope, not this americaan america that by far has the highest percentage of their working-age population on govt disability for life, far higher than any liberal european country an america where 50% of all military enlistees file for lifetime military disabilitiesan america where 20ml illegal immigrants do the real work"
"ARKQ bought a little more NVDA today:ARKQ 01/21/2021 Buy NVIDIA CORP 9,951"
Big money trying to get your cash before the inevitable upgrades.Oldest trick in the books.
"As per yahoo sponsored news everyday NVDA is in a buy zone for last 6 months, but then next day price falls mostly. They never mention when to sell or when it is in sell zone. To buy at the peak and hold for long , it seems risky for me. I will see when stock price come down near $450"
No one in the world  is holding NVDA over the weekend
"A little discouraging; most every stock i follow has easily recovered the past weeks drops. Will take some patience with NVDA; but fully expect to recover before what many ""experts"" predict a huge market wide down by June. A little concerned it (market crash/correction) happens in ""Sell in May and go away ""."
My favorite  thing to do is post something of brilliance than “like” my own post
"I hope Shorty covered, or Longs may have to think of a Go Fund Me for the likes of Kevin!"
NVDA keeps the streak alive of companies collapsing after great earnings now 1000 in a row
Every stock ARK Kathie Woods buys is down 30-40% in 2021. Market wanted to teach that 60 year old novice a lesson. She’s probably a Democrat
expensive above 500
NVDA down $50 into the weekend. 463 gap to be filled today. Anyone want to bet????
"It's all good news with NVDA e/r today.... no doubt it could UP HUGE by tomorrow....Chip giant NVIDIA (NVDA Quick QuoteNVDA - Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines after regular trading this afternoon, with earnings of $3.10 per share surpassing the $2.80 anticipated in what is yet another record quarter for the company. Revenues of $5.00 billion improved 61% year over year, outpacing the $4.83 billion analysts were looking for. Guidance for Q1 2021 on the top line improved to $5.3 billion from the $4.5 billion in the Zacks consensus.Its Gaming business brought in $2.5 billion in the quarter, Data Center $1.9 billion — neither of which was unexpected, but brought very solid performance in Q4. The company lauded Gaming now being the world’s most popular form of entertainment, in which NVIDIA plays an integral part."
The NASDAQ would have to rise a billion points for NVDA  to get back to $615 or 3 weeks ago
Price prediction for tomorrow
"So you think that a company with the nickname ""Ngreedia"" will not milk each a every penny out of this massive chip shortage? Huh? Huh..!?? Average Selling Prices are going to skyrocket. Nvidia will be making money buy the truck.. eh!? ..boatloads!!Nvidia is king! All hail the king."
longs today
NVDA bag holder's conference be held soon...Pls bring your own coffee and chair.
"Omg lol  omg  lol @ $491.99 I guaranteed NVDA would trade $299 before $482, dropped $10 without an uptick. Dow will be 50,000 and NVDA will be $299. Have to be brain dead not to see this shift back to real world  companies!!!"
shorts thinking they are right is funny to watch. NVDA still up $50 for the week
"This stock is so manipulated, $610 to $600...Huang should be locked up....just kidding....oh no !"

I'm getting drunk on a plane.
Anyone like $615 or $475? Anyone remember $502 this morning
Anyone in here ever listen to the greatest mathematical equation since e=mc2? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
rotation into cyclicals and industrials and financials continueseasily beating all other sectors
Stock with good earnings fall but within week stocks break there all time high..Twitter is a example so just hold
Gap at $504 to be filled. Also $532. Please be careful out there and trade accordingly.
Any STONK Cathie Woods owns is R.I.P. All of her funds will be R.I.P. this year

Hah!!"
I’ve been waiting for a good entry point. Today is the day!￼
Downturn is not going to last. NVDA is down with the whole chip sector today. Shorts will not get a better chance to cover again. Severe chip shortage will push NVDA back up to original pricing of $580 by end of March. Good luck to you all.
$615 to $504 today!!! Ladies Germs  here comes 504
Cramer is ready to pump NVDA on CNBS shortly. kiss of death.

It's not reversal at all. The rise of DOW means something away from tech. I see NVDA drifting lower n PE be like QCOM. I won't buy. It's going to be sold off.
I LOVE NVIDIA!
Hah! Hah!!
"Dumb algorithm trades - yield higher, sell... yield lower, buy... LOL"
"I wanted to sell at $615, and I didn’t pull the trigger. So regret it."
NVDA’s favorite phrase is.....”New lows for the day”
NVDA up this month from $516. We are glad to take those dollars and let the shorts take a couple of nickles.
I bet NVDA trades $0 before $500. Any takers?????
I think NVDA misses earnings and warns soon
im starting to think under $500 is no longer cheap and possibly a risk
NVDA down 20% in a week today on 14m shares 2x normal which means it’s going MUCH lower probably down 50% like last March
"Its all about ""Streaming videos"" in the Server market. Intel's Xe-SG1 is the BEST card for video streaming."

It's always good to profit take and not to be greedy. No one says you have to hold it. Buy low sell high. But don't follow like KevinTheLoser who only shorts and never longs.
"Something to read and digest....""The company is set to release the January quarter results today after the bell, and Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann expects Nvidia to post a “beat and raise.”“We see the January quarter being driven by strength in Gaming, Professional Visualization, and a continued recovery in Automotive offset by a sequential decline in Data Center,” the 5-star analyst said. “While the outlook will likely see continued adoption of Ampere and the recently announced Ampere featured laptops, strength in AI and cloud computing verticals, better than expected Gaming, and Automotive growth.”Mosesmann expects sales in the longer 14-week quarter to be above his and the Street’s forecast for low single-digit sequential growth, with EPS also coming in higher than his $2.80 forecast and the consensus estimate of $2.81.Nvidia’s main breadwinner, Gaming, should rise mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter, driven by “continued ramp of the RTX 30 series, products, work-from-home demand dynamics, and game console SoCs.”Of the company’s fast-growing division, Data Center, the analyst anticipates a cooling off period with a pause to its rally and a sequential low single-digits decline. The outlook for the segment is a key area to watch on the earnings call, where Mosesmann will be keen to learn about the likely duration of supply chain shortages, which the analyst believes will continue beyond F2Q21, and “controls on cryptocurrency mining using GPUs.”Additionally, over the next several quarters, the data processing unit will continue to be a focal point and is noted as another tailwind. All in all, Mosesmann makes no bones about his long-term prospects for the GPU heavyweight.“We see NVDA as the best managed and strategically positioned semiconductor company,” the analyst summed up."""
Looks like it will be under $430 tomorrow and under $400 Wednesday
May I know what happened to NVIDIA?
I see the perma bulls are once again out in full force! Short $515 and never work again by 2022!
"wowLooks like this is worse than NVDA fall of 2018 November.Nice opportunity to add more if you have cash, else simply stay put and be patient."

Where are the yahoo sponsored analysts who have strong recommendations to by NVDA and AMD?
NAS just suxchs right now. Tech not even remotely in favor. Time to add and check back in summer
nvda is notorious for making new all time highs then instantly getting the whack a mole treatment
Sell off #5
I think  people are finally beginning to realize that the stock market is no joke it’s not some game to be taken lightly and stocks fall 10x faster than they rise
"Comes right down to Shorty being greedy, should have Covered Monday! But Nooooooooo"

"Great products, waiting for my rtx 3080. But the point is waiting, not so much only b/c of demand but there is a slow down in the entire chain, meaning they can’t possibly be making the revenue that they should and it will never be made up."
NVDA is a sure winner.Trust NVDA and you will be rewarded.
Gotta love those $800 upgrades huh? Still think these analysts arent corrupt?
I guess I shouldn't have waited for the 504 gap fill.

ENJOY THE RIDE! REMEMBER....DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON A REGULAR BASIS WEEKLY/MONTHLY!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
The chips shortage is real. NVDA can basically name it’s price and have 10 Takers. This isn’t ending overnight. NVDA has a backlog of orders well into the mystic.These type of stock spurts like we saw today will be common place. GET YUR CHiPS HEYA. hehe 
I predict that in March NVDA is testing her 200 day MA at $450/$460. SAVE THIS BRILLIANCE! I would prefer AIDS to owning NVDA
Knew it would tank post earnings but this is a slaughter 
"Fed's Powell calms markets down - no rate increases - WSJWSJ - Tech stocks rebounded from an early-morning rout Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that a central-bank interest rate increase remains far off in the future, easing some concern over rising rates.The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, lower for a sixth consecutive session as investors recalibrate their expectations for stocks as bond yields climb. The broad stock market index earlier was down as much as 1.8%."
"anyone here who can't see AI, EV, cloud computing and dynamic video processing is the next 30 years and that NVDA is top in all of these...just keep waiting to buy and always miss the boat. I won't."
ARM will happen!! Hah! Hah!! One trillion dollars market cap. Soon.

$NVDA $WIMI $FB The whole world is throwing money in and scared money don’t make money. Close your shorts and go long. This is a BULL market!
NVDA needs to split to attract new retail buyers.
"Tech will continue to create new markets and opportunities through innovation that you're not going to get from commodities or cyclicals. With economic growth comes consumer confidence, which means strong earnings. Dips are buying opportunities."
"Two words, market manipulation. It’s so obvious it’s almost comical. NVDA crushes it with best quarter to date w/excellent forward looking guidance & then takes a 20%+ haircut, NOT SELLING a single share. Will be adding to my position very soon."
I think the reality of extraordinary supply crunch for the foreseeable future is weighing this thing down.
this feeling when you being robbed and you can't do anything lol correction they say ... hahahah basically just to load up more and next year they will start something different I whould not be surprised if they say inflation and tech stocks drop for another 20% just so they buy cheap companies with a sting balance sheets and great growth redicolous
Fantastic Day! Well done NVDA! 
Hey  longs $544 isn’t $615 BUT it’s better than $460
"Nvidia (NVDA)Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia today and set a price target of $650.00. The company’s shares closed last Wednesday at $579.96, close to its 52-week high of $614.90."
"@VIPUL keep dreaming. just cause it's down, doesn't mean it will go $25 down"

"This CEO HUANG I give him credit he is trying BUT he can’t compete with INTC & AMD long term. Also, he’s worth $12b and sells $100m a month in stock, so you really think he cares if NVDA is $500 or $600? It’s like the difference between $5 and $6 to most people, it’s meaningless"
Before feb 19 will be back easily fom 550 to 575....... earnings are coming with very good numbers....

"Vinfast said all three vehicles will meet the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 5-star safety rating, thanks in part to suite of electronic driver-assist features.

All three models can also be fitted with the hardware required for full self-driving, including lidar sensors, 15 cameras, Nvidia's Drive Orin computer, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Vinfast hasn't said when its vehicles will be ready for full self-driving, though....Vinfast's main plant is located in Hai Phong, Vietnam.

"I feel sorry for those who sold out. There is something wrong when people can not accept a reasonable risk for a reasonable return. What we have seen has turned some portions of the market into gambling, not investing. For the old timers, this may be acceptable, so I ask, is the market just for the strong and experienced like most on this board? I just can not see this as a healthy thing for anybody. Scaring away investors because some greedy turkeys want it all is not the answer."

No wonder no one here likes Kevin. Kevin loves the negative attention and that’s okay. Some people dig that sort of thing. I’m long NVDA and am looking to pick up a few more shares to add. Great day for bargain hunters who avoid these chat rooms. ￼

Wow! GM beat expectations but is worried about the shortage of chips (please read their statement on yahoo) . What a great sector semiconductors is! Time to increase production by all companies and all kinds of chips. I feel so good about this sector hence I am buying more such as FSELX with Nvidia as a major holding. WOW
This is going to be a moon shot day! Shorts will be eviscerated!

I'm not selling
$573 rotflmfao  Did it really trade there or was that fake? Tell me please it was fake. This stock is SO HEAVY
Overall market conditions are going to stunt any positive movement of this thing for a while. I was not expecting down $60+ into stellar earnings but I'll admit that I wasn't sure there would be stellar earnings. Going to load up more once we find the bottom but I'm getting pretty annoyed at this thing constantly trading sideways while speculative stocks like TSLA have split and blown up multiple times.

Praying for terrible  employment numbers tomorrow so NVDA drops $100
"Blowout quarter coming, TSMC ,ASML...now intel PC chips sales were outstanding while AMD is giving them a hard time, AMD will beat too. But nvidia has more expansion in various fields (like EV). We're going to see upgrades before earnings for sure."
Could we see NVDA down $40+ for the 7th time since August ?
I am done trading today but can't resist putting a limit order to buy 200 at $515. Let's go.
Nvidia has gone back to its roots. Its just a gaming company.
Nvidia green again. You can't keep a good thing down.

NVDA $520 is the highest this stock will ever be again ever! Save this brilliance
Sell $520 here NVDA will never ever be in the 500’s ever again after today
Be nice if CEO would stop down playing things causing the stock price to drop after a quarter. Same thing happened with AMD.

523 looooooll was 615 3 weeks ago looooolll was 589 7 months ago
$604 baby
"$1,000 after earnings!!!...............Well......maybe not"
"The chip shortage will take YEARS to fix. I think NVDA will be fine but I am thinking about adding more to KLAC, LRCX, & AMAT."
630 tomorrow
"Almost Every Major Tech stock was up yesterday, hope the rebound/rally continues to all new ATH."
Sure glad the qtrly report kept NVDA from taking a header today.
Remember AAPL FSLY QCOM AMD INTC all fell 20% after incredible earnings
You think 477 is low just wait for 299 this month GUARANTEED! ARK like their buys @ $615 or no?
NVDA fell $75 from after hours last night! I didn’t know they missed earnings that badly
NVDA will be down $50 tomorrow. Save this post please
Here's to ALL THE SHORTS who'll be servicing Jensen's Huang for the foreseeable future!
That was a bullish close today. 1.2m shares on the last 15 minute bar made up for the awful open. I would hate to be short this stock right now. Could up gap nicely tomorrow.
The winner of WHAT TIME  RED today was 9:31am EST. Congratulations  to all that played today.
Benchmark raises raises NVDA target to 670
Under 100.00 soon.
Need to see $450 first
522 -> 531 today
So much for never ever seeing $500 again.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
Great company but this stock been dead money for the last 6 months.
NVDA + $500 = Superman + Kryptonite Equation redone from $564
"NVDA up almost $20 AND up AH! Now that is BULLISH! This stock is going to get to $1,000 faster then I thought!"
I can’t wait until it fills the $463 gap and not one person in here acknowledges I was right at $519+
up on high vol = good
"Good news is bad, bad news is even worse.Never fails after any earnings report, does it?"
"Could be my most dramatic comeback ever. Down almost 6 figures, I am getting close to even for the day.It's been a wild ride this week. Very wild but have seen a lot in my 60 years of investing."
Great day to be adding to your positions on some of these beaten down tech stocks. Microsoft holding up exceptionally well.
Back to 600
"NVDA, share price is three steps forward, two steps back?"
"Yep, not just Nasdaq futures that are down. Russel 2000, DJIA and S&P500 all pushing solid red tonight at 11:30 ET. More blood letting when markets open in the morning."
"If this past week didn’t prove to everyone that all stonks in America are bloated Ponzi schemes, I don’t know what it will take to convince you all"
"WHAT, is seriously holding this down today ?I don't understand￼ !"
Can we please go below $500 finally in March R.I.P. NVDA
love how people think any positive news could move this stock. very cute. GL out there today. WHAT TIME RED?!
Just wait till $400 everything falling in place
GME will be higher than NVDA tomorrow at the close. Just watch how simple this “game” is!
GM QCUM AMD INTC all warned of chip shortages. NVDA will be next. All stocks crashed
"NVDA will be down $25 tomorrow to around $550, it’s 50 day MA. Trade accordingly. Earnings are going to be an absolute disaster for longs! Save this post!!!!"
If the stock was split so many people would jump on board. It’s a mental thing. Buying now or later has no difference in # of shares but from a psychological standpoint(if a 4/1 split was announced at $555) people will jump in at $138.75 with both feet.
Buying some more.
"Hey Kevin (just asking for a friend), did the repo man come get your Bugatti this morning?"
"NO STOCK, I repeat  NO STOCK  falls $80 right before earnings if they have good  numbers! Numbers were leaked at $614!"
"I immediately mute the Ponzi, Bubble, Burn etc. Spammers!Bye Bye"
"DC growth is not going to slow down as more applications centered at the cloud grows and more companies move towards the cloud. DC and video is only going to grow. This false narrative that DC growth might slow is ridiculous, we are in the early innings of an extra inning game, NVDA position is going to strengthen on all fronts."
Will NVIDIA break out to new ALL TIME high next week? YES!
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE! LIFE IS GOD MY FRIENDS! LIFE IS GOOD! DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON A REGULAR WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASISALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
Nothing above but euphoric speculations. Below? Much technical correction.
Bingo time at the Home
"HEY  EVERYONE: Just wanted to let you all know that Free-DUMB has 6500 shares of NVDA, most bought around these levels, so he’s lost $455,000 in two weeks. You all listening to him?"
"LOL  Don’t any of you rookies know how to read options charts? I was an AMEX trader for 15+ years, if you couldn’t see this stock had 0% chance of rising after earnings, then you should invest in a CD "
I feel bad for the weak hands who sold today. Nothing has changed in the company nothing for the negative that is.if you ever sell on market pull backs its because you haven't done your DD.
Ask the owners of Qualcomm how they felt holding long into all time highs into supply constrained earnings
He told you so last Friday
$519 buy order filled. Selling at $525. Let's go !
What happened to Needhams Rajvinder Gill. He left it to cramer to pump the stock or what.
"$510 close today, Kevin shorts are shot."
There’s a $10 drop in 10!MINUTES!!! BWAHAHAHA
Hey people you don't understand. Nvidia chip is a huge dinosaur. Intel Xe with its sleek chiplet design is the future.
Oh Kevin and Darth and all of the big short geniuses! This market just got the go ahead to go parabolic! NVDA 615 by Mid May at minimum. Maybe if you post 50 times from now until tomorrow you will wake up and absolutely nothing will change! You better check out of that expensive half way house you have been living in.
Still laughing  thinking about $615 last week and $602 last night in after hours ROTFLMAO  Bwaaaa 
"It’s funny that the shorts get mad that longs post analyst price upgrades and good news on here. Shorts call long pumpers even though they are putting real info out. While they spread rumors, lies , and make claims that it’s gonna tank on no basis or thesis to why. You guys are the worst and I’m glad the shorts get beat down so often."
Nvidia surging...again. Load up longs.
Sorry to say that today will most likely be a big sell off day for most stocks.
Is it too late to buy a share into nvidia?
Apple went up 7 bucks today. Buy both!
Bought Boeing and Disney. Cramer was spot on on both of those picks. He will be right about NVDA also.
"Want to be rich like me, Lanny? Just go in every message board on Yahoo that you are about to buy or short, and so the exact opposite of everyone else"
Kevin why you claim Nvidia missed earnings? I at least try to keep some sort of decency..
"I called the $504 gap 1000x, probably more, @ $615, and you all laughed. Right to $463! How about this gem: NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite"
$542....Give me $545 today. I am still not selling. KevintheLooooooser is buying dinner. $504 never came and I may sue him. I heard Rudy Guiliani is available.
"I was just a grape preserve, the last time nvda romped 10%. But I do remember that day because I walked in here the afternoon before and told y’all to buy calls. I’m not saying this thing will do that today. This is worthless. But I remember those days."
$800 PT? Cant even hold $600 
"Trying to catch falling knife hurts, make it stop please."
"Cathy Wood from ARK like her 250,000 shares of TSLA she bought the past few days? Her fund will lose 50% this month and she will have so many redemptions that she will have to close the fund down"
picked up some at the time of capital hill riot 508 was a great price
After 5 months here I have the feeling that a gypsy sold me a lame horse.
@LarryTheLegend said it was closing at $504 today 
"Other than Google, all FAANNG stonks have been R.I.P. for over 1/2 a year. Checking accounts pay 20% better. The quicker you finally come to terms that NVDA is done going up, and you find another stonk to invest, then you will feel much better. I own MU & WDC, bought them both 50% ago only because they never moved during the huge run up from March until August."
I don’t think there’s a sell off happening. Usually starts by now after earnings. Yesterday was the sell off.
weekly chart still looks south
Buy @ 400 and then hold for 5 years
SHORTED 557 and 535 today 
Look at the collapsing price of this dog stock but don't look at the ten years before that time. I need you to sell so that I can cover my initial short at $140 per share then I can move out of my mom's basement.
MU is trying to catch up. Did @Legend short MU...that would explain the action.
Where are all the guys saying it was going to 700 or 1000 lol. Glad I sold before earnings
"we can deny the fact that NVDA is a great company, but techs are very on verge right now, I'd love to get in at another safer point"
Ladies & germs  what time red 9:30:01am EST is my lock of the century
"Pls get ready for 472 support, and don't miss the buys at 336."
Next stop the 50 dma at 542.
WOW  WOW  WOW  NVDA “only” down $40 now! Congrats to all longs
"Just think  longs, NVDA only has to rally 22% from here to break even from two weeks ago LOL "
GME will go to $500 easy NVDA $299Save this post
"What NVidia really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for NVidia (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"NVDA will be down $40-$50 today by the close. I call this an “air pocket” stock. Once bitcoin tanks, and it will, NVDA will be $299 again!"
just ride the wave..
Shorted more $557.75 Easy money. Also buying put options here. Anyone sell the 600 weekly calls for $25 like I did?
You have to be in it to win it. Glad I bought NVDA a year ago.
@Darth Trader sewer boy. any idea what post report fluctuation is? you arent winning anything
"I have some NVDA. However, it is looking poised to run, so buying more. The chip shortage and the dominant GPU position is ready to gel."
I think I am done with this sector. AMD and NVDA are both underperforming my other investments. I’m getting out of chips
NASDAQ up 70NVDA down $6Asking for a good friend named Uncle Miltie

NASDAQ NOW AT LOWS OF THE YEAR AND WE ARE IN MARCH LOL  Welcome  to Blow Jiden

Conclusion: index funds like ARK buy hundreds of thousands of lowly stocks daily. The common investor is watching and jumps on the bandwagon. Index funds then pull their money making big dollars.
$530 will be the new forever high in NVDA save this post
"OMG  When NASDAQ was up 50 this am NVDA was $557, now NASDAQ is up 60 and NVDA is $543"
"Nvidia's chip is a huge monolith chip. Intel Xe is a sleek new design chiplet. Xe is the future, Nvidia is the past."
"I can't wait for the results tonight. There may be a lot of crow going around. If I'm wrong, I made the decision, it's all on me and I'll take the loss, and congratulate the shorties; well played. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not sure if you can say the same for some of these shorties."
Legend shorted this and lost again rofl
We’ll see if Kevin still posts every second after institutions pump this stock up to 800 this year
"Nvidia price target raised to $660 from $605 at JPMorgan JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $660 from $605 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The company reported ""strong"" Q4 results, says the analyst, who continues to see an upward bias in earnings estimates as we move through 2021."
can nvda bounce back to 500 by options expiration tomorrow?that would be nice and helpful500+ be even better
"Anyone own my GME? Remember at $39 I said GME would go back to $500 to $1000, and NVDA was $614 and I begged you to short? GME is going to $1000 minimum btw"
There is a better chance of hitting Powerball 100 weeks in a row than NVDA $564
"If this thing can somehow get above that 526 intraday high, I think it'll go green by the close."
What happened just now? Any news ?
The do not call Nvidia Ngreedia for nothing. Jensen Huang and Co. are milking each and every cent out of the chips shortage. Earnings will be amazing.
NVDA drops  faster than a prom dress  & panties  on a warm summer eve
beat on both top and bottom line and guided higher for current quarter...no reason this should be down...light volume in pre-market...lots of price targets raised NVDA will be back in the $600's
You hold a stonk in NVDA that has fallen from 615 to 495 in a week since terrible  god awful  earnings and could hardly bounce a penny
Looked it up : the completion of the acquisition of mellanox took 1 year. So if the knowitalls who claim the arm deal will fail get it right we should see a block long before that. If one of the regulators releases their decision the stock will spike no matter what the outcome is and that's when TA becomes usless.
"2cd upgrade of the Day:""Cowen & Co. analyst Matthew Ramsay maintains NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a Outperform and raises the price target from $600 to $665."" Treasury rate increase has big guys in a dither."
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS
my long-term view on nvda is a decade and morethru good times and badis what it isthis shtstorm will soon pass
I have NEVER EVER seen a stock down $50 after blowout earnings and upping guidance HUGE in over 30 years of trading. Congratulations to all the weak margined novices that made me a small fortune today
"Hoping to not wake up to NVDAs favorite number $519 ever again. I swear I woke up and checked my stocks, and 9/10 times in the last month NVDA said 519. I hate that number. 619 sounds way better..."
"It's going to break 500, and then 472 support. Mark my words. Don't mess with my charts."
The stock will be just fine without arm and if the deal goes through then the stocks doubles in a quarter
If you sell $514 here you will never regret it ever trust me you will be thanking me forever
Buybuybuy Buybuybuy then buy more

"This is the value narrative wall street is trying to use to con you out of your high tech mega growth stocks. The 10 yr. yield will not stay above 1.60 for any sustained period of time as the world is starved for yield and will buy our treasuries before that happens. Wall street is shorting the 10yr. They are trying to make you into ""VALUE"" bag holders and fleece you of your mega tech stocks!!! Do not sell technology and put sell orders in 100 points above the current price of NVDA so they cannot borrow shares against your stock to short.Look at Japan we are far more at risk for deflation. Bad environmental policy and taxes are what's making things like oil / gas, groceries and lumber look elevated.

"The reason 9 of 10 stocks sell off 20% after earnings no matter how good they are is like when someone tells you a movie is great, and your expectations are so high, it’s never as good as you think it’s going to be. NVDA is in the same ballpark into earnings! Look for disappointment like last earnings no matter how good things look!"
How many times did I tell you amateur traders that NVDA had a $504 gap to fill?
This is going to get scooped around the rest of the world overnight on all major markets would be a good guess. Only going to take one upgrade to launch it.
Watch  this theory: NVDA misses and warns to bring down the stock price SO they don’t look  too dominate in their quest for ARM
What a gift!

"I believe it’s pure manipulation. Five days ago NVDA was at $580. They reported a blow out quarter. Probably the best quarter ever, and it’s sitting at $513???"
We need some massive downgrades in NVDA and huge price target  cuts from $800 to $200
Down $105 this week isn’t enough need down $200!!!!
Anyone buy $523 @ 8pm EST in after hours last night or $463 before noon 
"oops: Shares in Intel fell as much as 9% on Friday, after the company said its corporate website was hacked, pushing the chipmaker to release its fourth-quarter earnings earlier than planned. George Davis, Intel's chief financial offer, told the Financial Times a hacker gained unauthorized access to sensitive data tied to its earnings report that was set to be published after the market close on Thursday. But upon finding out about the attack, the chipmaker released its results six minutes before the market close.""An infographic was hacked off of our PR newsroom site,"" Davis told the newspaper. ""We put our earnings out as soon as we were aware."" Without providing further details, he said the breach was caused by an unlawful action that didn't involve any unintentional disclosure by Intel."
"banjo sees a ""bearish chart""...I pull up the one year chart and it is less than 5% off its ath ah....Really? Too many mushrooms I guess."
"CNBS just pumped NVDA, I can take $400 profit now or wait till $1000. I will wait for $545 sell."
I sold off all my shares this morning at $552.01 three weeks shy of holding for four years with a 5x return . I still believe shares have $125 in upside over the next 12 months but my personal situation( I'm 58 on a medical pension that runs out at age 65) so yesterday's 8% drop had me rethink the risk of holding
Nothing can bring the big digital corporations to fall since they profit massive from the plandemic
$400 fair price over next two weeks

#FACTS NVDA $589 in AugustNVDA $591 mid February NASDAQ +5000 in that time frame

I can’t take this life anymore Breakers in Palm Beach  for a month $2500 a night pool/ocean/food/golf/abuse NVDA everyday non stop  ALL ON YOUR DIME
But hey Gamestop is up 45% now so the world still makes sense LOL.
Weird how no one ever listened to the facts that I presented them with 1000x. The proverbial cat  have all your tongues? After earnings NVDA will fall $200. Save this brilliance
"OK now everyone let’s see down $50 today, where she belongs. So down $10 right now, to around $600, it was $589 last August. A bank  pays better"
Bought 500 QCOM at $147. Valuation matters.

NASDAQ GETTING PUMMELED AGAIN.BUY TECHNOLOGY STOCKS!NVIDIA SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN......YOU'LL NEVER PICK MARKET BOTTOMS.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAINCHOO CHOO
It's been a couple of months since I checked the conversations being posted on the NVDA site. I can't believe the amount of garbage being posted here. Very disappointed.
you make me want to roll my windows down and cruise.
Hey  bagholders how’s that $547 looking????
Who is this Larry everyone keeps talking about?
I'd love to see 530 close today
"Bitcoin's energy use, and hence its CO2 production, are spiraling upwards.""It's very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery."" DUH"
I think Freedom and Hellraiser should go see a counselor. Then they can kiss and make up and be buddies again.
sort of disturbing when NVDA has a 5x greater loss in AH than TSLA.
Options control the price of stonks but I am sure all you bag  holders realize that 550 pin  is their goal  Was blindly obvious even @ 615 just learn how to read volume & open interest. WHY do you think  NVDA fell $50 after earnings? Because 95% of all options bought before earnings were call options
weak hands are being shaken off and the train moving fast up at opening..
Nvidia is back to being a gaming stock. No reason for such high valuations.
I'm confused... isn't Xmax in december? HAHA thanks for the nice discount
I guess you need those Diamond hands for the nvda.
"HUGE article out today on NVDA in IBD, very well written, says NVDA is not a buy right now. Read the article, back out of here and go to NVDA Yahoo news  it’s the first article. It’s long but VERY well constructed. Sell NVDA now!"
Will close $550 That’s where all the options are Watch & learn
No one in the world  would dare hold stocks over a weekend
Kevin down another $20 million.
Post this 40X/week
Nvidia has reached the bottom
It's not going red atleast today!! Go green! $550 next week!!
"I guess I'm one of those ""buy and hold"" old timers. All of you guys are fretting over what the stock does in a day or a few hours. ""Short now"", ""buy now"" and ""to the moon"" statements are causing me much nausea. I was fortunate enough to buy part of my holdings in 2017 at roughly $90 per share. Continued to add through the following few years with last purchase being right before the Covid drop last year. I'm more than happy with where my investment currently sits and what the future holds moving forward."
Buy on the dips its very easy!!!
Where you at Legend? hahahahah
Unexplained drop in technology illogical drop in technologySome say it’s interest rates some say it’s yields or bonds.Insiders taking your 2020 gains in technology away from you. Even fang Tesla can’t defeat the carnage.Bleeding out
Hold and buy NVDA for the next decade and grow rich with all the long investors. Don't be like Larry and miss out on all the wealth.
anything Kathie woods touches of Ark is 100% going down
Want to know my theory? I think NVDA insiders sell like crazy to keep the stock down so the stock/company doesn’t get so big it looks like a monopoly and they can get the ARM deal done
We are very close to next support level of $500 in coming sessions. Most investors won't believe me.
That $502 was a fake trade today for sure
Shorting $491 here I think she hits $299 in March. 200 day moving average is now breached for good
"NVDA got very bearish charts. Check it out. Funds selling, but retail filling the bag like no tomorrow."
"Just wait until they break into the healthcare industry powering ai driven medical instruments, this stock is future proof, their chips will drive innovation across many future industries they haven’t even tapped yet"
kevin da klown has far bigger issues to deal with than the stock market
roughly half way off the impulse lows and highs
"seems to me that the treasury bond interest rates rising a few days ago spooked the market. apparently, when rates rise, people are more prone to leave stocks and seek the safety of bonds. the FED unspooked the market by saying the rises were likely just temporary. or perhaps they used the word fleeting. anyway the market has been on edge anyways, and this morning treasury rates went up again, which i think is the spark that led to today's market downturn. just my hunch."
reiterate my prediction at the open $625 and close at.$675
NVIDIA reached an all time high at 594.99
Price to sales ratio 25....bubble territory. Love the company but the valuation compared to say AVGO is absurd.
If you didn’t sell NVDA $540 exactly at huge resistance with the 50 day MA then you fell victim to one of the 7 deadly sins: GREED
"600's before we have the usual upgrades from at least 6 analysts into earnings, we may have price targets as high as 750 soon imo"
"Nvidia (NVDA) – Price target raised to $700 from $600 at Oppenheimer Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer raised the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $700 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of the company’s Q4 results on February 24. The analyst sees upside to consensus estimates for Q4 and Q1, led by GeForce gaming GPU as demand for Ampere continues to outstrip supply. He sees supply tightness lingering at least into Q2."
EXPLOSIVE! Broke out technically. Onward to higher HIGHS! All time high now!
NVDA 615 to 510 in a week -105 and still tankingBottomless pit 2 more weeks like this and $300
Kathie Woods ARK down 40% in 2021 top hold she’s been puking  out is NVDA redemptions tax selling margin calls etc all at once
KEVIN

3 good days on the nasdaq and it's 600's again. Kevin and co burnt their fingers once...it will happen again.
$615 to $535 is what percentage loss? Hold please. Every $61 is 10% so down around 15% this month ROTFLMFAO 
This could very well break its recent ath and touch 600 before earnings. Shorts are heading for the exit and upgrades are coming.

"Even I'm surprised by the number of stocks getting hammered in this selloffs. It appears so savage, ruthless and nasty. Around and around the correction goes and where it stops no one knows."
"NVDA was $545 before last blowout earnings now $550. It was $589 last August. It was $615 last week. Great company, bad stock."
let's all buy 50 shares each right now
Long and Strong baby!!!
Buying at 504
"Dear Navidiadicts,Cramer is dangerous. People have lost billions under his so-called guidance. Avoid his so-called market intel as you would a house afire. Motley Fools are always right until they're wrong, which is the case 90% of the time. List to the advice of someone who is right 90% of the time and went wrong, admits it promptly. NVDA has peaked, pure and simple. Stockholders and interested investors should select one of Following options:✓place protective stop 2 to 3% below the opening price on Monday✓Sell the stock sometime within the first hour on Monday and replace it with a stock that has much better prospects for growth. There are many to choose from.✓ option your stock If you are concerned about capital gains or have chosen to hang on long-term.✓buy the March 29 $50 Puts and close that position at 25% gain before next Friday (control your greed and take your profits even though it will probably double this coming week) You will see a minimum of 25% appreciation in those puts by Tuesday at 10: 45 at latest.This is not a pitch to improve my personal position It is out of concern for those who are too attached to this particular stock and face steep losses. It's because I care. Thank you for listening.I am a private investor with 45 years experience. I do not offer advice as a professional and highly suggest you do your own homework. Study the chart, look at the recent price action, sector rotation, etc.Ok?"
"OH NO....I sold ALL my NVDA at $460!!! Oh wait, nevermind, I actually have a spine and won't sell for many years! I did pick up a couple more shares at $472 though so all is good. We'll be back to $600 in no time flat! Good luck longs!"
The NASDAQ would have to rise a billion points from here for longs in NVDA to break even from 2 weeks ago
Infrastructure will be next and that will pop the economy big time with the 5 trillion will be putting into that. Not a 10 year plan but a 4 year deal so 1.25 trillion more per year next 4 years. 100% American materials (ie steel lumber etc) and all union work with even subs very strictly set to union standards Trumpka very happy there with afl-cio. Lot of revenue for this come from a Wall Street transaction tax and with a nice 3 year additional gas tax with its side benefit of forcing people to more fuel efficient vehicles which will be subsidized. Watch GM get huge subsidies to re open plants like Lordstown and Janesville to build new electric and fuel cell vehicles. New sherif in town and elections have consequences. Oil not worth $10 barrel in 3 years
NVDA is down more than my other shorts TSLA CRWD PYPLI made more money today than any day in 30 years LOTTO DAY
"NVDA ER (Earnings) expected on Feb 11, 2021. Relax longs and best wishes."
"YOU DON'T SHORT THIS STOCK, how hard is that to understand. It's a 1K stock, sometime soon too.."
Anyone ever in their wildest dreams at $557+ up $15+ think we would be WHAT TIME RED with the market at highs of the day?????
cover Larry
Is there a possibilty to buy call options on LarryTheLegend's time on NVDA MB? That would def be a life-changing investment.
Did Mr Jen Huang just sell 24m worth of shares?

"Here’s reality rookies: NVDA was $545 two earnings ago 6 months ago both total blowouts both upped guidance and $467 Friday. NVDA was $589 with the NASDAQ at 9000, went to 14,175 and NVDA was $550. Asking for a friend loserTARDS"
NVDA is the only stonk I ever shorted in 30+ years that fell $150 after getting 100 upgrades
NVDA is the king in the Graphics and Compute & Networking space. Buy it and hold it for the next 10 years. Makes a lot of money. End of story.

"Nvidia price target raised to $672 from $643 at TruistTruist analyst William Stein raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $672 from $643 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares as part of a broader research note on semis. The analyst also selects the stock as one of his best growth ideas for 2021, highlighting the company for its opportunity in parallel compute applications like server acceleration / AI, gaming, and eventually autonomous driving. Stein adds that he sees Nvidia as being ""driven less by the raw performance of its chips, and more by its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and software investment""."
"From wccftech:""Some retailers in Europe have even hiked prices of the RTX 3060 up to a massive $835 USD (or $689 EUR) which is absolutely insane considering it is almost three times the original MSRP at this point."" Yow!"

Sluggish. Might not embark on its next run above 550 until a few weeks prior to ER in May.
Wait until 350 to get IN. It was 180 last year
NVDA back to same prices in June of 2020 almost a year ago
"@TK12.. Great day, huh? ;-)Nvidia is king. All hail the king."

I don’t understand who could still be selling at this point

"Stock is way oversold...you're telling me Nvidia isn't worth more after the 3000 series released? During a global pandemic where most people stayed home and were more interested in building a PC or gaming than in the past? Of course if I buy, the stock will go down, as is tradition."
"Undoubtedly one of the worst stocks in the market. Has been one for the last 6 months or so. Moves up in sporadic, haphazard way, never building any kind of momentum, all compounded by the fact that, unlike Roku, Msft amd and Tsla , one hardly ever hears any news from the company that might lift the stock. Wouldn’t touch it again."

"Evercore ISI says Nvidia remains top growth idea in semis after earnings Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said Nvidia's results and guidance came ""in in-line if not better than buyside expectations,"" but its outlook for the ""all-important Data Center business disappointed on the margin."" However, "" taking a step back - it's really not that bad,"" said Muse, who thinks a hyperscale recovery in the Data Center starting in the calendar second quarter should provide a nice tailwind on top of the strength being seen across key verticals. Muse reiterates his Outperform rating and $675 price target on Nvidia, which he said remains his top growth idea in semiconductors."
Selloff #2
Where have all the shorts gone?
"RIP Kevin, it was a good run... ""NVDA will be down $10+ at one point tomorrow or I never post again"""
Tomorrow will pass 600
Nobody is complaining today about Huang and how NVDA is manipulated....all nonsense. Enjoy the ride. Semi mergers and takeovers are real.
Ascending pattern still intact Kevin. Learn to read a chart
Told these perma bulls 1000x NVDA would be down $50. Well $42 so far and not even close to a bottom. I may have to adjust that to down $100! Even TWLO the only stock to trade up $50 after earnings gave it all back in two days! 9 of 10 stocks reporting TANK after earnings! The reality of earnings always kills momentum stocks
$519 huh? That is the all time high forever save this post
Other big chip competitors are afraid of Nvidia's ARM moves - Congrat Jensen... Nice move.
Let me be the first to congratulate all NVDA bag  holders from last August. You just broke even 589
Why is this a surprise? You want Democrats this is exactly what you get and there is no bottom
I don’t think  I’ve ever been short a stock that falls $50 intra day with no gap almost everyday for 2 weeks
Really rallying nicely from the lows. Money managers knew they could get a nice return at these levels.

"Will see $1,000 soon"
"10 year is now 1.47, I am calling a bottom for now. Buy."
"Squidly, are you in here?"
nvda will test $1000 this year!
HP had a blowout Q as well and it's up 1% while the nasdaq tanks by 4%. Today's nvda action is clearly a planned raid and I bet big money is accumulating at these levels. It'll get better.
"Wipe em (Shorts) out ! Instead of “LarryTheLegend” (better known as: LarryTheClown) getting his 10 perfect 10 Call Girls, “LarryTheLegend” (better known as: LarryTheClown) will BE THE “CALL GIRL” !Albeit no 10 but that’s what some of The BoyZ like !"
"We're at the same level as before the ARM news, the blowout Q3, various contracts, design wins and upgrades Historically we get a run up a few weeks before earnings."
Kevin go short intel
"$510 order filled, order to sell at $525, hopefully tomorrow with option shenanigans."
WATCH NVIDIA CLIMB TO $750+ BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS.
it is going to be a nice start to the week
so happy to be above $500 that was a brutal two week long ride
But it wasn’t overpriced at 615 according to the pumpers!!!
"NVDA now under, for anyone who charts, “her” 10, 20, 50 & now 100 day moving averages, and 200 day moving up as this drops around $450, once that gets taken out after earnings, look  out below, possibly $299!"
WHAT TIME IS IT? IT’S NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!!!!NVIDIA BLASTING OFF!!!
The range in NVDA is $130 priced in after earnings so around $430 to the downside
WHO BOUGHT SHARES TODAY? WHAT A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY WITH THE NASDAQ SELLING!CONGRATULATIONS NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!
"Im holding,the narrative and growth story has not changed,in fact its even better"
it's about time to adding more shares of NVDA. the future is so bright for long long term investment. The demand in crypto and EV are huge for next 10 years.
this volatility have to stop !!! nvda to stay above 600 where it suppose to be !!!
Earning are late...accounting problems?
"I guess Cathie Wood is not buying NVDA today. Chop, chop !"
BUY NVIDIA NOW
Always wonder how many calls were sold by the market makers that they now want to lower the price to zero them out. Doesn’t seem like a lot of shares traded in the AH that took it down. We’ll see who blinks first tomorrow and Friday. Hopefully many here bought some short term downside protection.
Not to worry about the drop. Needhams Rajvinder Gill will raise his price target tomorrow and we'll fly.
Double bottom goes right to 1 trillion market cap!!
buy today cuz this is going to be 675 by the 25th
Back over $500! We’re back in the saddle again!

Just bought my first share can not wait to see what the next 12 months bring!
CRAMER SAID NVDA WILL BE DOWN NEXT TWO DAYS THEN ITS TIME TO BUY
hold that 200 ma.
NVDA was up 20 percent in one month and shorts are like it’s down 5 percent the last few days. Like come on y’all.
Hint to longs: look at the put/call volume and open interest on a stock before buying into earnings. Do the opposite of the “Joe Public”.
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!NVIDIA READY TO BLAST OFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS! NEXT STOP $700$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN

Gamestop is up 300% in 4 days btw. And it's not a profitable company. Modern times.
Thoughts pn earning guys?
NVDA has almost tripled in price in the past 12 months. $400 seems more appropriate for now.$600 by the end of 2021.$800 by the end of 2022.
No wonder new price targets are $700. Good job longs that got in early.
"Definitely a frustrating stock at the moment, especially for new share holders. Hopefully earnings will make a difference and the stock isn't just waiting for ARM news which is probably a year away."
"Possibly tax related selling by Robinhood investors of NVDA and TSLA shares to pay taxes in April ? Relax longs - Jensen beat and raised estimates. After this tax selling, it should rocket right back up. Best to all. My opinions only. Relax."
tomorrow closes above $578
Pull up the 6 month chart NVDA on Yahoo exactly 532 six months ago then pull up the NASDAQ chart up 40%
$517 is the all time forever high in NVDA for the rest of our lives! Please buy INTC and short NVDA
How is NVDA only down $2 in after hours? HOW? Will be down $50 tomorrow minimum

"Think about this: How soon will there be enough GPU's for everyone? Even if Nvidia never releases a new product again and just keeps making the current, how long will it last? My point is, I plan to be long for at least that much time, which is a lot."

"And this isn’t even priced in.“We are making good progress toward acquiring Arm, which will create enormous new opportunities for the entire ecosystem,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement."
They’ll do whatever it takes to make sure Friday closes below 600 so calls/put can expire... but they can’t stop the earnings rally that’ll definitely blow NVDA past 700

A few days ago there was a silver shortage... Now there is plenty of silver. Its all a game to get the Reddit traders to squeeze the shorts in the chip stocks.
Looks like the PPT is in full control they needed to stop another tech wreck . LOL
now take her to 5:20 make up some of that down turn and really put a lid on some of the chatter
"You all own a stock that beat earnings by a mile upped guidance huge got 20 substantial upgrades by very influential firms, and NVDA hasn’t had an uptick since, SO why would the stock ever trade higher again?"
Chip demand is through the roof. Chinese EV manufacturers lusting for NVDA chips. The gamers and the miners pounding the table for more (expensive) NVDA chips. And there sits NVDA in the catbird seat. 
I repeat NVDA is peaked and signal for market run is over too. I have seen this for many times. Be careful

Hopefully no one got faked out and sold during this mornings little tiny dip. Just keep adding shares.

"more fear from interest rates rising, competing with stocks. it's like they think all investors are going to sell their stocks and jump on the bargain for a 1.5% yield of a 10-year treasury. silliness, and this too, will pass. just bad luck and bad timing. an excellent quarter from nvda. hold onto your shares. nvda shares are an asset that will only get more valuable. i will go out on a limb and predict nvda will give investors more than 1.5%/year. good luck out there."

"Was originally planning on building a PC, but NVDA 30's graphics cards were literally no where to be seen. Which then led me down an insane rabbit hole of silicon issues, cryptocurrency miners, scalpers, botters, AI, automation, machine intelligence, video games (so many like me building their first pc build), that I feel even after the insane gains the company saw in its stock price this past year it still has room to run. Either that or I've gone full blown crazy..."
"If NVDA warned on next quarter's earnings, it would go to $700 by week's end."
"the more you buy the more you save, that triggered the largest buying rush in NVIDIA history. now out CEO says he's getting the arm deal done. hold on bros $1000 this time next year."
Buy this stock after the bankruptcy in a month or two. This stock is going to $15.
Please short sellers consider taking into your home some Nvidia longs that get totally wiped out. It is hard to see NVDA longs down on their luck and homeless.

a very up day today. but ain't nothing to worry about folks because there is a severe shortage of chips around the world and nvidia is so important manufacturer. I say with utmost confidence buy more. Yo want more than nvidia then buy a mutual fund such as FSELX from Fidelity . There are other great family of funds too offering a semi conductor mutual fund I believe.
strange day for sure....America has become the place where truth has been replaced with delusion

"JPG File Sells for $69 Million, as ‘NFT Mania’ Gathers Pace“Everydays — The First 5000 Days,” by the artist known as Beeple, set a record for a digital artwork in a sale at Christie’s."
I still believe its the 42 TFLOPS of Intel Xe chips that is keeping Nvidia down.
"$900 in 3 years, just have to stomach the volatility"
613 two weeks ago! Ha. Unreal
NVDA will never ever ever trade higher ever again ever. Save this brilliance
"I warned you all now. Sell $545, you will never get a higher price in your lives! Trust me! Sell buy put options and short! NVDA will never see $500+ again by tomorrow"
nvda should have mkt cap @ $600Bthey will soon announce a stock split and then will double by 12/31
As soon as the 10-YR T-Note yield reverses and heads back toward 1.60% NVDA will head lower. Enjoy this bump while it lasts.
"Haha ,,,, I am holding from $230 but man I am not at all surprised to see this going down .. Same happened with $AMD a few weeks back now $NVDA also seeing the same trend. The market is disconnected with the earnings unless some rule changes"
"Down -24.6%, big enough dip ?"
"There are several that own 1,000+ shares of NVDA and trade within margins and easily make tens of thousands per day, ever day, it fluctuates $25-35 because of this reason."

NVDA 540 weekly puts up 110% today wow  Knew I would make 100% but not until tomorrow Holding out for 500%
Gap at $504! What time red? INTC down 10% after blowout earnings! NFLX $593 to $560. Tech stocks R.I.P.
How is it even conceivably possible for people to think  $467 was the low???
"IMO, the market has peaked. People don't realize unless they see their accounts getting smashed or wiped out."
"Maybe  if the Dow is +100,000 NVDA could hold $500! Lol "
"Shorters will get fried by the Reddit crowd, who is on to this stock. Beware."
Has to dip to 450 and I'll add another time. It's to early to buy now
"My $600 call options, what are they worth today???"
"Disembark the nervous passengers from the rocket.As we know, after a quick fall, there is a rebound. I am waiting for a stock for 490, then for 517 within a month."
Futures are green.. but will it stay or continue to drop mid way when market open?
"OMG  Day after day week after week month after month hundreds of millions in call options bought in NVDA non stop (no put options) and obviously options run contrarian, SO NVDA (TURD ) drops like a rock daily and all the options holders get wiped out......"
chip shortage time for a run
WS always send signals to GO outttttttttttt ...bears are showing their claws
"Nvidia after-hours weakness a buying opportunity, says Jefferies Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis noted that Nvidia shares traded lower in after-market trading following the company's earnings report despite its January quarter EPS and its April quarter EPS outlook being consensus, which he thinks is because data center revenue was flattish quarter-over-quarter and concerns that Crypto is driving gaming upside. However, he believes that data center is in a ""digestion period,"" and notes that the last digestion period was a good buying opportunity, adding that he views after-hours weakness in the shares ""as a particularly buying opportunity."" Lipacis has a Buy rating and $680 price target on Nvidia shares. (the fly)"
UNBELIEVEABLE bounce back

"too bad iv on nvda options blew up biglast week nvda options were tossing it out hugecoulda turned 5k into 10ml on two trades in three daystoday, not so much with iv off the charts"

"Ark Invest believes that Bitcoin will skyrocket. Tesla just bought $1.5 billion Bitcoin.When the price of Bitcoin goes up, more people will want to mine it, which increases demand for Nvidia graphics cards, and makes it more difficult for regular customers to buy them. Go look around on YouTube, and you'll find gamers complaining about not being able to buy the 3000 series graphics cards because they're going to Bitcoin miners. The insane demand is also driving the prices up. It's gotten to the point that Nvidia is now re-releasing the old Pascal series because they cannot meet the demand for the new cards."
"Engage Beast Mode, over. "
Next resistance is $150. We got this!
the very day nvda hit it's 463 impulse lows i repeatedly stated a 50% retrace to 540 is the first target
615 to 482 ROTFLMFAO Please tell me that no one believed $502 this morning
NVDA is going a lot lower 495 here Please listen to me and short sell the 500’s & buy put options
weak hands that sold today will be regretting it come Wednesday after the close
Screen  shot  $492. For it will never ever be this high ever again

Somebody knows whats coming AH. Assume your positions.
BUY NVIDIA!GREAT DAY TO BE A BUYER!NASDAQ DRAGGING DOWN GREAT STOCKS!
"Discipline. Sell at alltime highs, upgrades and pre earnings!!!!!"
Back in the day a huge earnings beat with upgrades would send an equity into orbit. Wow look how things have changed. Two words: criminal manipulation
"Let's talk about investing in the semiconductor sector. Ask yourself if you have the stones for it. Nvidia and other semi and semi equipment stocks are volatile. Nvidia once peaked at 290 or so only to plummet back to 140 then surged up to the recent high over $600/share. The historical price graph isn't smooth and linear but rather more of imperfect sawtooth. Our resident short caller isn't wrong, let's call him Kevin for the sake of discussion, in this respect Nvidia will surge and retrench in cycles. I've ridden this stock and other similar stocks that will make you want to wear an extra pair of undershorts from the open of premarket to the close of the afterhour session. I'm used it and have been nicely rewarded. Buy when the price offers an opportunity as an investor. Trade the volatility if you prefer because the vol is there if that is how you want to roll. There is something here for everyone."
"What we need is that EU inquiry on the ARM acquisition to go away. Once that happens, you'll see some nice upward movement, big!"

"OK, entire market is down. But it's a little backwards when the 20 stocks on my primary watch board, only X has has a greater pct drop; and NVDA is 3x pct loss greater than NASDAQ. I did shift to greater than 50% cash a few weeks back due to a lot of fear mongering of an imminent market crash. No plans to add to anything; but will keep cash handy."
"Waaaay overvalued. Gaming losing to RADEON, no datacenter gains, no major supercomputer wins, AI/ML losing to RADEON and intc. FPGA will take over as well. No arm deal. Nvda will be 150b market cap in two years. Mark my word."
Got a great fill on my short 557 plus weekly 550 puts NVDA R.I.P.
615 to 450 in two weeks. Congrats  to all of those who voted  for Weekend At Bernies
Sell and short. It's just BLIP

"Oh dear, looks like the shorts are losing their religion going into the close. Makes you wonder why eh?"
VIPUL NVDA $515 or AVGO $495 or LRCX $603?????
This is the new support level. I firmly believe $660 gets hit tomorrow or possibly even today.
It’s good seeing a stock crash  on HUGE volume and no news right before earnings. 
hope this brake 500 so ylmy hair will grow back again lol

Remember I was telling you guys to go long GME and short NVDA/and almost everyone in here made fun of me/GME $200 NVDA $450
NVDA $615 to $460 down $155 LOL in literally less than two weeks without an uptick
Anyone remember $519? VIPUL all your profits from your last 100 trades wiped out
Trending on yahoo yesterday was an article that the United States government was buying more and more chips for its usage and experiencing a shortage. What does that mean? It means that the chip sector has to increase production and hence increase sales and profitability.
Longs!!
Don't be fooled by the shorties on this board!
"yo it will turnaround and go to $1,000 and all them nay sayer folks will eat crow. I sayeth it because I believeth in what I sayeth. yes siri bob we went down today but Babba knows a great buyin opportunity avail it and take the opportunity and yo will be happy. Thanko"
"Breakfast is over, sure hope they don't cancel arts and crafts.One of the twins, but they are actually the same person, yesterday said he would never post again unless Nvda was down 10 during the day. So much for promises."
Is Benjo just Kevin again?
"China claims “severe shortage “, the United States Government claims shortage and GM and Ford etc etc claim shortage of chips. But Nvidia which I do and continue to do or Buy FSELX Fidelity Semiconductors. This fund includes all the companies. It is a mutual fund. I did not want to keep it a secret. I want to share the information with all of you . I am sure there are other family of funds who offer semiconductors Mutual Funds as well ."
I just can’t even comprehend or fathom that with $0 commissions that anyone would ever buy and hold a stock in 2021. So you guys know how much I have made shorting NVDA
"Another day, another NVDA decline."
"Had 10 units at 525,Added 5 again at 465 todayWill add again on big drops"
some old school green lantern action - may the green ring of power destroy the $600 price point and keep going.
"I thought a crash was supposed to happen to the market as a whole, not just one."
"Down again! Does it hit that 510 level & bounce? Seems like that's the support level. Kinda frustrating to have such a great earnings report and sell off, but that's the way its going."

When NVDA was $557 this morning I read 100 posts “it’s going to $600” VIPUL was smart enough to see it too and sell. You TARDS better learn how to read options charts and volume before spouting off

EV and autonomy is just beginning guess who has the foot in the door with the chips that are in the EV and autonomy industry.... let me not mention gaming, Ai, VR, AR, datacenter, cloud ........ mmmmmmmmm like I said yesterday NVDA is the future that will help the future become a better future."
"Leg End , how is CRWD? DDOG? FSLY?"
NVDA is going MUCH lower than $400! You will be wishing your mommas never met your pappas at $250
share price 2024 around $2000. this $2000 price tag is the point @ which NVDA's CFO said in 2019 that they would split the stock.
"Breaking news: Kevin just got arrested at a Breakers hotel for trying to pay his bill with a stolen credit card, and for having a suitcase full of toilet paper, mini soap bars, and towels. The maids said he was a slob, and kept repeating things as he does here."
"If they can dictate price of their products, I would say PT should be $1000 by year end."
Going to gap down $50 tomorrow morning to $450. Will be $298 by Friday. Trust me
One lesson never listen to Kevin.
NVDA is controlled by options players and there are a lot of weak shareholders that are always the first to panic
WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!! CONGRATULATIONS ON BUYING TODAY!!! YOU WILL BE RICH SOON!!! HAVING A MARGARITA AND FISH TACOS HERE IN VEGAS! ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND!!!
Looking for some analyst to slap an $800 target tomorrow.
No one in the world  would ever dare buy NVDA into a weekend with the 10 year squeezing higher than GME
Its nice to see NVDA breaking out before earnings. I just wonder out loud what will happen post earnings. If NVDA runs to 610 area then where does it go after EA? Announces split & sells off?
Be nice to recoup yesterday’s pullback and Onwards and Upwards to new all time high 
nvda promptly got the whack a mole treatment on earnings
"Record quarter. Record growth. Beat estimates in every way. Plus strong bullish guidance going forward. Incredible company, outstanding stock! Super bullish here. Holding NVDA long term never disappoints."
Its making room to go up on arm deal confirmation.just hold
Ladies germs  what time red 9:30  am ET
Shake out shares to reap endless profits at expense of small investors who don't have comfort to know manipulations or honest enough to try investing?
NVDA 200 day MA badly broken Going a lot lowerI think they warn Chip glut is the rumor
NVIDIA is set for blowout earnings and a solid guidanceWall Street analysts expect NVIDIA to deliver $2.80 per share in earnings on revenue of $4.82 billion. The numbers are almost in line with the midpoint of the company's revenue guidance (issued in November) of $4.80 billion and an earnings estimate of $2.79 per share.Investors should remember that analysts were originally expecting NVIDIA to earn $2.54 per share in adjusted earnings on $4.42 billion in revenue. The chipmaker set the bar much higher when it released its fiscal third-quarter report in mid-November.
614+ to 513 in a week What’s that % loss longs?
That's all folks this will be back to 135
NVDA bag holders conference is still on time. @Raj @ Kaplesh are special invitees. Pls check your email. Bring your own coffee and chair.
The 52 week Covid low is $180 it’s going back there
"OK now, don’t get mad  at me, for I am ONLY the messenger asking for a friend: Did you all like NVDA at $557+ or here at $542 and falling, as the market hits all time highs????"
"I am repeating my 472 target with buy 336. Don't challenge my timing n charts. BTW, don't miss bag holders conference scheduled for Thursday !!"
Anyone not believing in NVIDIA future take a look at GTC 2021 content: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/topics/Deep Learning and AI touches pretty much every industry now. And it is just the beginning. And NVIDIA is in the center of it. This will be a 3T company one day.
615 to 578 LOL Down $40 so far with earnings out Wednesday LOLLLLLL
Hey Darth! $600
"nvda 3/5 490p +9,200% in three daysomg"
Jensen when the arm deal gets approved.
I want to buy NVDA at $535 for a quick $5 profit. let's go.

BUY AS MUCH NVIDIA YOU CAN EACH MONTH. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN! ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
Who owns both nio and nvdia? Yes me...  And I also own tesla for back up plan
NVDA is going to $299 this month. Buy every put option you can get your hands on. Wait until the broke RobinHood traders have to pay cap gains from 2020 and they have to liquidate
Imagine where NVDA would be if Bitcoin didn’t go from $20k to $60k when NVDA was above $600
Posted my biggest short position in years at $525 before I made the trade. Now $519. Going to $299 short term
Thumbs up if you think I should mute Kevin.

No way this finishes green going into the weekend. Everyday there's new financial news coming from the Biden administration that sends the market into a spiral and a lot of nervousness about news this weekend. I'll think about picking up more Monday but expect down into the $530s prior to close then we'll see what else happens. Also expect any ground breaking news from NVIDIA to come today after hours.
at this price... it seems a good buy
We have a winner 9:31 AM
Where’s Sir Kevin?Covering!!! 
Oh my gosh!! Look at that drop.
$600 baby let's go
I found TK12 ...

Bye bye 480 forever 480 will be it’s all time high Kalpesh you likey Buying a Lamborghini SUV this week
Soon it will split 1:10 and once again go back to 500 as fundamentals are so strong
There it is another call for $800! ROTFLMFAO!!! This stock will collapse after earnings. Never saw so many TARDS ever in my life
I will cover my final shares and go long next week at $297
"What time red? I say before 10am EST. I am 100% sure of it. Trade accordingly and buy the weekly 530 put options on the open like me, & don’t dare forget to sell the 600 calls for the 30th week in a row"
Out. Be back at 515
"""Full-year revenue was a record $6.70 billion, up 124 percent."""
"From Motley Fool:NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress recently pointed out that the demand for its gaming GPUs (graphics processing units) is ""off the charts."" Supply levels are likely to remain lean through the company's fiscal first quarter that ends in April, according to Kress. A shortage of components is also hurting supply, but NVIDIA is reportedly in a better position on that front as compared to rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)."
"I've been investing for decades and have NEVER seen anything like today. I was DEEPLY in the red for my portfolio and NOW I am very much in the GREEN. The volatility and panic was extreme. It pays to just sit back and let the dust settle. Investing is the hardest thing anyone can do. It requires so much patience. Lastly, it gives me EXTREME pleasure to see SHORTS lose their rear-ends. They are negative people who are GREEDY and want everyone to fail. They always end up in the grave-yard where they BELONG!"
NVDA chart since August 2020 is hilarious 
"Down $20 at some point today for sure; sorry  if you TARDS don’t heed my brilliant mathematical equation of NVDA + $564 = Superman +,Kryptonite"
12% up after opening ...or $650.00...for sure !
Nvda is setting up for a rally to the 1000 level... perfect set up with no movement the last few months. Earnings will be monstrous
"Here its is, shorts. Your big drop you all have been wishing for. LMAO."
$615 to $515 and yet all the same perm bull longs who seem to all have an endless supply of cash  screaming buy while I have been shorting like crazy 
Should I buy? Or is it too late?
Got in at 516.5 expecting a bounce at the 6mo support. This co isn’t going anywhere but up based on current market demands
Under valued share in the world be ready for big move may be $650 soon hold tight and go little longer
If we can get NVDA down $50 tomorrow at the open I will cover 1/4 of my short positions
JH coming on mad money tonight after the Bell. You think he would come on with lousy numbers? Hehe. Vamos! 
BUY NVIDIA !!!$1200-2000 IN 12-28 MONTHS.
update:Legend and his army are pulling ahead...come on longs.....you can do better.
Signed up to (http://Rightpicker.com) last month and instantly saw why my trading buddy has been banking so many winners. She tried to fly under the radar but the secret is out. Join them today.
"Since Kevin has a million shorted shares, I assume he's down $7 million today. May have to sell one of the yachts."
no panics! tomorrow's labor report may trigger a 700 points rally.
ARK Investment Cathie Woods loaded up around $520... $600 plus here we come !!! 
"Nvidia today announced at the GTC China Conference that its CloudXR platform will support the Tencent Cloud platform, allowing cloud users to stream XR content to remote VR and AR devices. $Tencent, $WIMI"

The double talk Cathie Woods just spewed was incredible.
"Only good news for longs in ARK Cathie Woods probably the worst trader who ever lived unloaded NVDA today, BUT so did Jensen HUANG sold 24,000,000 dollars worth"
$524 is the highest NVDA will ever be ever again! Mark and save this post
Why is nvidia people not switching to tsmc now that they know who controls the chips
"BTW, as if anyone didn’t notice, it’s “LannyDaLegend” using my real name Lanny now, so I can receive the much deserved adulation from my fans."
YES $499 yesssss finally
NVDA # 1Buying every 3 monthswill be good for the year!!!
This is the new USA ?? where companies like GME about to go bankrupt rise 500% and stonks with huge earnings fall 30% in a week. Cancel culture anyone who isn?t a #$%$ This is what you all wanted. The second Mr Alzheimer?s was sworn in I sold and shorted everything
"Autonomous driving, AI, Gaming, Crypto Mining, cloud data centersNVDA has them all and is the best at them all."
"Gaming gpu's , all sold out and EV/AI sales are probably going through the roof with all the new contracts. MLNX adding to revenue and gains. Coiled spring because all of this is not priced in. And neither is the ARM take over. When that happens it will be ""nvidia inside"" for 75% of everything I guess."
So the 600 calls won’t be worthless on Friday? I’m thinking the options book kid needs to turn it upside down or something.
"Hi 610, next step is 700 after earnings report! ALSO Kevintheloser cant be found!! Hes missing!!"
"Potential for 1000, 2000 SP one day?"
I think scalpers have made more off this company in the last 2 earnings cycles than the shareholders. I still cant buy a card since Septembers release. I'd buy any 30 series if I could. If that doesn't boost earnings I don't know what would.
"NASDAQ up 500 from the lows, and NVDA still down $10; this may honestly be the worst stock I have ever seen in my life, hands down"
u would think that this company didnt beat bottom and top and issue strong guidance in a chip short industry smh is this a joke really how does gamestop go up 40 percent and nvda makes 5 billion a qt let me say that again 5 billion
"I am in at 261 per share, great long term core holding, will be a lot higher going forward."
NVDA is the future that will help the future become a better future :DYou understand?
Going 450! Will buy 4 more there.
"This could be 100pts higher in 2 months, companies like intel/amd start reporting in a good month, time flies."
"KevinTheLoser, today must be a very sad day for you. Losing both Nvidia and Fastly shorts. More to come. Bet your broker is looking for you now."
"NVDA came back and tested (breakout) resistance, now support, should continue its journey higher now."
Lookin' good on a very bad market day.
You all now realize what you own. Right? A house  of cards in a wind storm! I can’t believe anyone is long this stock here into earnings!
How low will Nvidia go. Anyone know.
Longs who think NVDA is going higher after great earnings: Check out TTD tonight absolutely crushed earnings by a “mile” upped guidance and down $30
"Hey folks, back from my IKON Colorado Tour. Heard I was missed."
I like it - up 8% & ~ 15% above Average Daily Volume ALREADY! Bullish signs for sure !
Anyone ever wonder who the people are that sell in ah after a quarter like that.
Rejected at her 200 day MA $485Shorting large
"NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) had its price target increased by Needham & Company LLC from $700.00 to $800.00 in a report published on Wednesday, Benzinga reports. Needham & Company LLC currently has a buy rating on the computer hardware maker’s stock."
Making so much money trading NVDA should be illegal. Just kidding. $6k so far this week.
Didn't put in my buy order last Monday morning. Glad I didn't. But I DEFINITELY will at some point. Stock has fallen much more than I would have expected after that BLOW OUT earnings report AND company expectations for great future growth. Will take the plunge soon for long term holding.
Lots of Robinhoodlums and Reddit traders moved in NVDA. They will sell at the first sign of downturn. Watch out.
Watch for 550-570 by Friday. I see 524 before earnings.
Only has to rise 12% for longs to break even from yesterday lol 
What a ride!
NVDA fell $20 from it’s pre market highs $575 to $555. Good  luck to all longs. This is the end of NVDA forever.
"Shorts we have $400 in bag, stay short"
Will buy if it dips below 500 $
"it's not just nvda. it's the market. high valuation companies, mostly, i think, are dropppppppppin."
Congrats patient longs! Our time finally comes :)
Buying 5 more at 460 another 5 at 400 and at 300 I'll buy 15 !
does NVDA make chips too?if so they will benefit with the shortage of chips right?GO NVDA # 1
Is this breakfast time at the HOME ?
Feel so bad for longs :( Closed out my puts today at a nice profit and covered my short position.

Apple Nvidia and AMD are all on the same Algorithms. There is no strategy here hold and look for other stocks to make a buck
This head fake from institutional holders lasts about 24 hours or at most till Friday weeklies expire . This is heading north hatd
"Everyone expects this to raise after the report. It might also fall 50$ or do nothing. The other tech giants also did, nothing or fell ...."
Is this Nvidia or AMD??
I'm waiting for my electric toothbrush to have AI. It should know what to do without my help.
Will hit $504 gap tomorrow night in after hours. $550 right here is the best short ever in the history of the stock market. Trust me and sell and short here. NVDA is R.I.P. DOA.
Going lower. I did it. Single handed destroyed NVidia.

NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Write  it down and don’t ever forget it
"Et voilà. Added some at 513. Gaming, mining,AI,AD/EV,data centers, ...it's still booming."
Hint to longs: When you see 10x the amount of call options bought over the put options into earnings the stock is going A LOT lower
"i am buying more. and i already have ""way too much""."
Where are all the NVDA perma bulls in here today to tell me I have been right almost everyday since I appeared in here August 2020 (was long until then).
NVDA not even down 20 yet and longs are complaining; will be down $50 by the close minimum
What stocks would you buy to diversify without selling NVidia which is now 26% of my portfolio
LOL $497. So simple yet so easy once her 200 day MA breaks $450 by tomorrow and NO ONE is holding over a weekend
green!!!!
No one is buying NVDA into a crash  and a weekend with bad job numbers
550 by Friday.!!!
@Freedom Seems your missed! Perhaps stuck on the l-80 trying to get over Donner Summit. I’m sure you’ll make it to Squaw for some Afternoon Freashies.

Anyone here bullish on TSMC? NVDA is my only semiconductor position but TSMC seems to have the global supply all to themselves.
@ $615 I read minimum 100+ posts in here (I refer to them as Joe Public) that NVDA will be $650 before earnings and $700 after earnings! I have a question: Do you like $550 tomorrow?
"$575 finally, not sure why but I'll take it."
I said down $50 today yesterday Not a bad little call by me
"Valuations matter. Most over valued semi stock on the planet is NVDA. If you want exposure to Chips, buy AVGO, LRCX. You will sleep better and great dividends."
"nvidia, only green stock on my watchlist, ...impressive."
My perfect scenario: people are tired of the beating the nasdaq has taken in the last few days and everyone buys nvda tomorrow because of good ER :) that would be a dream come true
"nvda is one of the few chip stocks today that is greensmh underperforming market againas money broadens out into other sectorsfor the overall market, that is a very good thing a very healthy sign for the overall overmarket means the market has much more to go"

$350 is where valuation starts to make sense. $300 is where you should think about buying. We'll get there before the month is over
The weekly 550 calls down 70% today. NVDA really is the gift that keeps on giving!
I guess $110 straight dollars  down the drain isn’t nearly enough LOL  going under $500 this morning anyone remember my “gap fill @ 504” rule that I have told you all about 1000x?
here come $600
How’s that $700 price target looking by Susquehanna ahead of earnings? LOL 
This stock is great at disappointing following earnings.Management has no concern for shareholders. BUYBACK SHARES.

When AAPL and TSLA both drop 20% tonight NVDA will be $490
No question... $QCOM and $NVDA shareholders will take a close look at $NIO now... And realise it's a great opportunity to invest in too...
We were higher mid august and forward pe is just 33 while there was about 50% yoy growth. Madness. People aren't interested in future wealth anymore. Ponzi scheme like investments like GME with instant gratification on the other hand....
Just buy Boeing BA & Chevron CVX here no matter the price and short NVDA $516
From 610 to 463. What a drop! Maybe tie to add to my long position
"nvda up $14 today and $7 in AH. 100% solid gains. doesnt matter how much up it goes, it's up in the long term"
$463 gap needs to be filled enough said rookies
Nice gain today. The climb to 600 has begun.

Any longs like that “quadruple top” over $580? Is it $600 yet? Will test her 200 day MA $460 after supply constrained earnings like INTC QCUM AMD
markets going to have immaculate recovery again today......fed ready to crush debt with more obscene debt
My question is why don’t people like Kevin learn from shorting NVDA and just go long? Why continue to lose constantly? He’s been on this board bashing since NVDA was $400. That was $214 ago.
genius genius genius !! believed in u since 64 this is only the beginning go nvda
"yeah, ok, i was startled for a millisecond: Qualcomm buying Bay Area chip startup Nuvia for $1.4 billion"
NVDA declares a dividend R.I.P. that’s always the top  for any tech stock
What happened here today?
diamond hands get rewarded
The only outstanding question is the exact date we hit $1000. I am open to all suggestions. For those of you that can’t see the fantástico drivers in front of this gem of a company. May I suggest taking up another pastime. Perhaps Birdwatching or Butterfly collecting. Certainly stamp collecting could be an outlet for your lack of stock investing prowess as would bowling. Hehe. 
The regular Hyena's here will be silenced as Nvidia goes green just around the time they all get in line at the Salvation Army soup kitchen for lunch. They are still mad that the SA doesn't deliver meals to their trailer park.
The confession of an imbecile: I should have bought more Nvidia stock. I bought my first 300 shares at $26.90/share. I added another 345 shares over time with an total average cost of about $145. I could have bought more but I didn't. Don't be an idiot like me. Today I placed my hand on hot stove burner for failing to add even more to my Nvidia position at much lower prices. I'm so ashamed I can even leave the house. Just keep adding shares.
NVDA is not more than 336 at all. Funds will get out like BABA.
You all realize we’re going to $700 eh? Ok just checking 
"NVDA only down $10 off it’s highs, going back below $520. By Friday. Trade accordingly."
Bought more shares.

NVDA just fell $10 after Mario announced that it looks like it will be green today literally to the penny.
"Darth Trader has been reassigned to the AAPL Orchard, calling for a 1.75 T drop in apple market cap. Tune in for post 15,500."
just remember Jenson said 'the more you buy the More you save' love that quote
"What a week. Finally unloaded the calls that were threatening my whole position for 5 months at just above breakeven. Was able to keep the gains since 17 and keep my shares. Great stock but scary options, for me anyway. Could have done better if Id have waited but was sick of the 1 day spikes."
Let's be honest with ourselves here. Nvidia stock has NO TOP !!!
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite This equation has held true since I posted it last August 2020

My source at Morgan Stanley says 10 year will be under 1.50 later today and 1.45 by Friday. NVDA will be over $525.
I guess China (geezer) Joey is adding to the fuel upward for this great company.
"NVDA going x div tomorrow, make sure to buy at close to capture the dividend."
Cant wait for the commie CEO to mislead investors AGAIN at earnings.
"SOXX, which is the semiconductor index in which NVDA is a big part of, was up 33% since July, NVDA down 15%. Seriously longs, AAPL earned $112b in a quarter and fell from $145 to $129. You think NVDA which has a serious  supply constraint issue, is going to rally after earnings?"
This market runs to the next shiny object.

"For the bears and short sellers here in this page - you can keep shorting this stock, and in fact its is very healthy for this stock to down trend for a while after the amazing run they had in the past years!

They continuously innovate and bring state-of-the-art AI models and practices!! take a look at their recent model which generates HIGH RESOLUTION human images - https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ - This is truly MIND BLOWING !!!!And if you don't get the true connection between AI and NVIDIA you can go and check my latest videohttps://youtu.be/7ZiZE7GmJ7w promise you that after you get the business model of this company and its real future - you will pull your short positions!"

ONLY down $11! That’s the best reaction NVDA has ever had after earnings
"Was considering buying more as soon as it broke below 500. I'll wait until next week to see if these head fakes stop, and begin showing a a true up trend. Won't even mind buying at 500, just need some evidence it's done downtrending."
"NVDA to $550 in March, $600 + in April. Watch and learn!"
Arriba NVDA! 
600 at open
"btw: eps in may expected 2020: 1.69 (they beat), share price was 355 eps in may expected 2021: 3.20 (that's almost +90%) share price converted +90%=680 and we're not even talking ARM here, can you say undervalued?"
"The NASDAQ could rise to 100,000 and NVDA is never ever going up ever again. Sell $509 here"
"Best $20 stock I have ever picked! I believe that this will reach &1,000 by this time next year!"
OK fess up  rookies who bought $557+? NVDA great  trading stock way beyond the top of her range. R.I.P. 
"INTC posts record revenue and is down 5% and they had no shortages of products, just imagine the drop in NVDA upon earnings due to supply constraints. I will say down $200."
YUP. earnings will be great
Who else has viewed episode 275 on Dave Lee on Investing? Looks good for Nvidia.
NVDA up a penny pre market I would short it here 0% chance it ever goes up ever
$515 today? I think not! I think  NEVER! Path of least resistance is much lower
Intel Xe is a brand new chiplet design. Nvidia's graphics is a monolithic dinosaur. Game over.
"Loved  when NVDA earnings came out at $580 traded to $602 in after hours, because no one really read just how bad their earnings were"
Next support level for NVDA is around $450 in coming sessions. No new upgrade is coming from the analysts except yahoo sponsored articles which incite the retail investors to buy every day.
"I am going to call NVDA earnings “the Qualcomm effect”. Was trading all time highs $167+, supply constraints, BAM $140! And CEO said, “we sold everything we made, but we just weren’t able to make enough due to supply constraints.”"
COME ON AND RIDE IT THE NVIDIA CHOO CHOO TRAIN!!!
"When you see the average shareholder of a stock, in this case NVDA, has an IQ below 50, you know the stock will crash"
Will be a good er. The question is will Nvidia fall like so many other semi stocks on a good er? Perhaps that era is now behind us and stocis go up on a good er...again.
NVDA will fall to $460 after earnings guaranteed supply constrained once again like every awful quarter
4 more market days before ER....I say 625 to 630 BEFORE wednesday night. That's only +6% or so.
Short from 468 to 614 I come in here for 7 months at 589 1000x a day begging you to sell and short NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
"just like every other tech company this earnings season, beat and raise and stock goes down"

"Haven’t sold a share, excited for earnings, exciting for 2021"

"As disability awards grow, so do concerns over the veracity of veterans’ PTSD claimsBy Alan ZaremboOctober 16, 2014The 49-year-old veteran explained that he suffered from paranoia in crowds, nightmares and unrelenting flashbacks from the Iraq war. He said he needed his handgun to feel secure and was worried that he would shoot somebody.The symptoms were textbook post-traumatic stress disorder.But Robert Moering, the psychologist conducting the disability examination at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., suspected the veteran was exaggerating. Hardly anybody had so many symptoms of PTSD so much of the time.As disability awards for PTSD have grown nearly fivefold over the past 13 years, so have concerns that many veterans might be exaggerating or lying to win benefits. Moering, a former Marine, estimates that roughly half of the veterans he evaluates for the disorder exaggerate or fabricate symptoms.Depending on severity, veterans with PTSD can receive up to $3,000 a month tax-free, making the disorder the biggest contributor to the growth of a disability system in which payments have more than doubled to $49 billion since 2002.“It’s an open secret that a large chunk of patients are flat-out malingering,” said Christopher Frueh, a University of Hawaii psychologist who spent 15 years treating PTSD in the VA system.Diagnosing PTSD can be difficult in the best of circumstances. Experts have long debated how to define the condition. One person can suffer crippling anxiety from an experience that would not faze someone else.Assessing PTSD becomes even more difficult in a VA system that gives veterans a financial incentive to appear as sick as possible, former and current VA mental health clinicians said. The number of veterans on the disability rolls for the disorder has climbed from 133,745 to more than 656,000 over the last 13 years."
"Not to worry if in for long as short moment those weak hands could do wildly things causing market turmoil...but overall it should be up and up...no doubt about that since tons of upgrades before and even today higher $800 target, that's amazing and good point for NVDA stock long holders...."

The analyst notes that the fundamental backdrop for the company is ""particularly strong"", and while his estimates for Q4 are in line with consensus, he sees Q1 estimates by the Street as being ""low"". Srivastava adds that Nvidia's gaming business is particularly strong, with crypto mining adding to the demand, and the company is being ""more proactive"" than the last time in addressing the crypto surge."

"ensen HuangThanks for joining us today. Q4 have the truly breakout year for Nvidia. The two biggest engines of our business gaming and data center posted powerful growth. Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry, and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve with the countless metaverses.So I'm for placed on for work. Gaming at simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Crowd computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips on servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now.With our expertise in AI computing full stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud to edge platforms, Nvidia is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy efficient CPU company will help position and video to lead in the age of AI. This year was extraordinary.The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics. This underlies the accelerated adoption of Nvidia’s technology. The urgency to digitize, automate and accelerate innovation has never been higher. We are ready. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks a lot."
"As predicted, this stock DID NOT close above 600 share price and the 600 Calls are worthless. So I predicted weeks ago. And let’s be honest, options control the share price."
Right now the 10 year is all about the big banks and protecting their huge exposure to very interest rate sensitive derivatives. We are talking about trillions and trillions of exposure. The most agregious is of course our friend JP Morgan and ruler of the universe Jamie Diamond
NVDA will open below $450 tomorrow guaranteed
Unreal. Its like they atr giving it away
I destroyed NVidia! I destroyed NVidia!!! Hahahaha 
Look  @ the NVDA chart rookies it’s right back to where it was last July and we all know it went to 468
Monday at the latest NVDA will be $204. Anyone see AAPL & TSLA after earnings? Both down 20%
NVDA will be $299 before $500Anyone want to bet?
Will have the “Apple effect” at earnings. Have outstanding numbers then get crushed AH and the next day.
Simple: BUY PUT options expiring Friday $50 under the near close at 3:50pm EST today and retire for life.
This is the beginning of the fall to $504 by Wednesday. Good luck to all traders. Buy XOM
Is Nvidia's run over. Its back to being a gaming company. So it should be $100 stock.
"Saw Dan Niles on fast money, a must watch, a former SEMI analyst, there are only pockets where there is shortage but overall world is flooded with chips. Not sure what will happen with all added capacity."
"Cramer today...""So, let me go over my impressions of Twitter (TWTR) , Salesforce (CRM) , Fisker (FSR) , Nvidia (NVDA) , and Airbnb (ABNB) , surely the biggest guest list if only because we have never has more than three guests at once.First, let's go over the two the market got wrong. Let's start with Jensen Huang and Nvidia. The quarter just reported was superb, as usual, but the conference call brought out lingering fears of 2018, where Nvidia ended up with some slowing end markets, crypto and data center. The latter soon accelerated, but because of an oddity of not knowing whether its cards were being used in gaming or mining, the company saw an inventory glut when bitcoin crashed.This time around the data center spend is accelerating, because of the move to the cloud, and the company has a real hand on crypto, which could be a good business and Nvidia will have its own Ethereum mining chips that can be monitored. The market was wrong on both counts. Can Nvidia close on the Arm Holdings deal giving it the best full suite of chips for every fast growing market? After doubting Jensen on the ability to close on Mellanox, I am not going to make the same mistake this time around. This stock is way too cheap versus next year's numbers-not this year's-and it's a buy."""
No one in this room is selling. Am I rite!?!?
I still say that trade @ 519 was fake. 0% chance anyone could have sold NVDA anywhere near there. Fake trade/news

So the market may be having a temporary FLING with Game Stop, Broke Airlines and Movie theaters who were becoming anachronistic before the pandemic, but we're not going to get to the fruition of AI, Cloud, 5G , Electric Cars etc on potato chips!!!"
Going to see 472 support. SELL OFF
"up $12 AH, Jensen rubbing salt into the wounds of the shorties  I love it!"
@Freedom party in the USA
"Hey Kibbles and Bits, lay off the vets."
the earnings were great and the company is amazing.. reason why its going down?
What happened here?
Hey Shorts! In just over 2 hours ————-> Here comes Da Pain! Jeje 
650 to 700 by Wednesday easy
"Kevin, tell us about the gap at 530 that needs to get filled today."
i will buy NVDA every dip. have been for the last 4 years. Jensen will help me retire 10 years early.
Quite possibly the most hated stock on the index.... for no good reason.
It’s funny how companies 5x larger than Nvda are crying about the arm deal. Pretty ironic. Big corporations scared of Nvda
"Anyone sell $540 this morning WHAT TIME RED? NVDA has fallen $20+ ten times since July 2020 in a single day and only went up $20 once, NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite"
"Every single BLOATED OVER PRICED call option is worthless toilet  paper . They will probably allow this stock to trade higher once every option buyer, and there were billions bought, all calls, are $0"
Will be interesting to see what this does with the 200day sma at $489.
Selloff #6 on a +330 day. Writing is on the wall.
WE GOT A ROCKET LAUNCH!NVIDIA ROCKET LIFT OFF!WE HAVE LIFTOFF! LOL
"I love NVDA and have more than doubled my money with 500 shares, BUT I have to and need to diversify, so I've started buying NIO and GEVO. Hopefully they will go big like NVDA has!"
"Did I miss something? Did demand in gaming, data center, self driving cars, AI, and machine learning just evaporate? Not to mention a little crypto kicker. This thing is down over $50/share from its high and has been basically flat since like last September. I think it is time to load up."
Hope someone asks why the ARM founder dude has such a Hard... oon to allow the deal to do through. this is business not charity!
600 today watch it
Every stock in the index will go green before this thing.
In two minds - should I add to my position or buy som other stock. Have not been spending much time researching stocks to buy.

$492 is the forever high ever in NVDASave this brilliance
Should have bought more SQ too at $191.
this is going to turn green by close
NVDA could easily fall $100 today. Already down $75 from last week!
$515 to $557 and you are shocked it’s going back to $515? Doesn’t anyone know how to read a chart? Shorting isn’t hard folks. Just hit short instead of buy.
Anyone know Darth Trader & Kevin one and the same ?
Dow all time highs up 500NVDA down $120
I Repeat strong sell on this. No kidding..it's going to fall badly.
"Once REDDIT Wall Street Bets/RobinHood takes over your stock like I knew they did in NVDA last week, it’s automatically going to crash"
What a great buying opportunity.
Back to higher highs and higher lows. Good.
Should I wait to buy at $504 or $475 or $299 ? Please advise Kevinthelooooooooooooooooser !
NVIDIA AT 600 plus soon..
NVDA is going down $50 today minimum/anyone short $535 yesterday at 2:30pm on my inner loins call????
"I have seen a few recent postshere, regarding the earnings report date change to March...I did my best to find any information on this,,,Was not able to see anything/news about this-Unless I am missing something the report comes out tomorrow.After close I imagine/and it’s not pretty, for sure.I will be cautiously optimistic that this momentum will continue,but in the real world...This company is currently in the Shi_ter,,,financially and otherwise"
615 to 460 in about a week or two So every 46 is 10% so NVDA has to rise 40% to break even from last week WHAT TIME  RED???? 9:30  am EST NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
Anyone here ever buy $519? ROTFLMFAO    lol
"You could have switched NVDA to LRCX at the same price of $540 last week. LRCX $585, NVDA $545."
Just hold long term and stop worrying

"hey kevin, did you cover your $111 and $151 puts over at FTNT yet?"
700 wall coming up longs. congrats Jensen.
"Saturday afternoon thoughts on NVDA: (1) QCUM AMD INTC all down 15% after earnings due to supply constraints (2) NVDA down 589 to 540 while the NASDAQ has risen 5000 points (3) NVDA 589 to 540 while the semiconductor index SOXX has risen 27%(4) Please listen to me, sell NVDA short, buy puts and sell 540 stock, for down 15-20% is $100+ downside"
375 by next Monday
Anyone buy $602 last night after earnings or $550 now!
Down $25 and closed at the low.
Why are so much sell off in the market?
what a breakout. patience pays
Zacks expects $13.27 earnings per share - wow The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 14.2% in the past 30 days to $13.27 per share. The figure indicates growth of 32.7% on a year-over-year basis.
I'm in favor of a split. Reduce the SP and bring in additional investors. NVDA has plenty of room to run as the economy recovers.
I called 800 by July a year ago. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN!
"I can't understand the concerns by some on this board. NVDA is historically volatile, and often going the wrong direction soon after earnings. But no doubt it will shortly break out of the 600 threshold again, to quickly annihilate the recent 614.90 high. Also, a PE of 90 something is nothing for a company with enormous growth potential. If the news of ARM acquisition completion drops, then seatbelt needed from there on. It will be rollercoaster but to higher heights at each break out."
"@Kalpesh....we need a victory dance, please."
The great Nasdaq crash of 2021 thru 2023 has just begun. Nvidia is in fact being tossed out with the Nasdaq bath water. Nostradamus predicted the end of Nasdaq and semiconductor sector in 2021. Do what is right and sell your shares so we can make the prophesy self fulfilling.
"Don't fight the tape. Nasdaq Composite down below 13,000, first time since January! A whole month up, all gone away. l expect some bounce Friday, but still a negative day IMO."
$513 inner loin short going to $463 I won’t cover a penny before
NVDA $460 tomorrow night after bad leaked earnings
NVDA down $20 and falling; will be $460 tomorrow! 615 to 550 I am begging you sell now buy it back 100 lower
I did say bad news yesterday and seeing 7% plunge today
"$SOXX +3.5% today. Yep, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. $AMD $NVDA"
Anyone see GME $172 today LOL  so simple yet so easy now going to $500 for sure this week save this brilliance NVDA $463 by Friday
NVDA 615 last weekNVDA 602 after earnings NVDA 557 two days agoNVDA 541 yesterday am NVDA 512 now going to 489
I've told you under $500 by the weekend
Shorts enjoy your success. Not gonna last long.
The mighty NVIDIA up again today.
Wait until the Kia Hyundai/apple news gets absorbed. That alone takes us over 650. The routine of Europe/UK investigating rhe arm takeover was programmed to begin with.
"TK12, how many times a day do you calculate what your shares would have been worth if you weren’t such a pansy?"
Just shorted $580.17My 23rd position Cha Ching
Selloff #3. Hold that commie responsible!!!! Everyday this gets CRUSHED
This thing doesn’t move. Having any stake here is literally losing money. Good look anyone that’s holding. I’ll love this to into chip makers. Looking at you $NVDA
"with rising rates, sector rotation is underway and semi's got the back of the hand treatmentnvda will survive and thrive"
The amd fanbois never learn. They'd better be worried about amd's valuation in a shrinking x86 market and intel getting ready to strike back . And losing market share to nvidia as well. Nvidia has said it could take 18 months for the arm deal to be accomplished so another 12 months I guess. In the meanwhile nvidia's mgmt see it as a done deal as they're praising the collaboration on their website (AI possibilities etc).
How is NVDA still $539? Not even down $100 since last week. Makes no sense. A lot of “meat” left on this bone!!!
volume is picking up too
"MU is acting strong today too, if you are long"
I will go live at 02:00 PM Pacific Standard Time
I am begging  you to short NVDA $517 here. It’s not even close to the bottom. Trust me!!!
Definitely worth dollar cost averaging in at these levels if you are thinking long term.
"I am long NVDA, but I want to point out one thing that people seem to not understand about this company: they are not a ""Chipmaker"". They are a fabless semiconductor design house. This matters because they are held hostage to the same chip crunch that everyone is fighting right now. A chip shortage means NVDA cannot get enough chips to build their final products, and it also means paying higher prices to Samsung and TSMC who are the fabs that actually produce their chips. It also means they will have to commit to larger order sizes, and build more inventory in the future. These are certainly headwinds to this stock. I don't think this is concerning enough to sell, but certainly not good news."
"back up we go, up $10. Kylie and his boyfriend Darth tried to come and act like NVDA is going to red "
Thanks to both Kevin Sir and Freedom Sir! They each know who they are more than they let on !!! :-)
Perma bulls are weird 615 to 480 and every dollar they scream buy here/are you all using Monopoly money or are you all trust fund kids?
Get ready for LIFT OFF After hours. This stock will have BLOW OUT earnings.
I warned you guys. I am in and my inverse Midas touch takes place. When I held Intel it went down every day. I hold 5 share's so not to much to lose. Guess what? I'll not sell till we reach 10$ roflol. I have warned you because I play fair!
10 year treasuries varied between 4% to 14% from 1964 and 2007. The economy and the stock market for most part did fine. Then the FED went nuts and now 1.5% is horrible? Eliminate the FED!
Lol. These markets are a total joke.
Anyone else here been selling the NVDA 600 call options every week for the past 7 months and banking 100% per month? Or no?

NVDA Sideways CHART for 5 months has got me worried
"Analyst out saying, “NVDA looks pricey into earnings.” Gee, really? Where was he at $615 when I was shorting?"
"$NVDA $GOOG $WIMI check out the bid and ask. Nobody really wants to sell, shorts getting forced to cover. Nowhere to go but up "
So many pumpers dreams shattered last night - how may bought AH at $600?????
Buy buy buy buy
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH MY BUDDY THAT WORKS AT NVIDIA. HE SAYS THE COMPANY IS FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS. BUY NVIDIA!
$480!!!!!!! YES!!!!!! Anyone remember $502?????
The NASDAQ was down 450 points and people are concerned lol
Maybe I need to forget the market and just buy a bakery that makes weddings cakes for transgender couples? Obviously the rules have changed.
AH and the following day after earnings you can expect 4-7% decline due to a shortage of materials and the unsure status of the completion of the ARM'S deal.This is still a good company
Today doesn’t count zero volume R.I.P.  DOA  NVDA
I can see nvidia up 5% today. gonna be funds who weren't in buying now
We all know this will give back what it gave yesterday 
"NVDA slid with the market, nothing more to read here. Earnings were great, not spectacular, but still great. The stock will continue on the upward trajectory in the coming months."
Guess Kevin just hang himself. He claimed 350$....
when i see chronics falling all over themselves squealing the market and the world is coming to endbuy with both fistsFUD spewing chronics AWAYS crown the lows
rock on
Let’s get loud fellow Longs! This is a major breakout this week with ambitions to once again double this year 
"You're buying best of breed here, the penultimate chip maker on the planet...you're not investing for tomorrow or next month....you're investing for the future, a year, 3, 5 yrs out......folks are reminding us NVDA dropped 50% last yr, but that was in the midst of a demand collapse of everything but food....NVDA will make new highs again.....margin money is coming out of the mkt today....real investors are here to stay...."
NVDA was $481.99 and I said it would trade $299 before $482. So simple yet so easy
Please remember today near the close to panic out of Nvidia in an orderly manner. Thank you.
"You amateurs like NVDA $589 last July or $499 now in March of 2020, 8 months later? ROTFLMFAO "
"This is just incredible, this company is just growing exponentially:“Moving to Data Center. Revenue was $1.9 billion which exceeded our expectations, was comparable to last quarter, and up 97% from the year ago period, which did not include Mellanox. Data Center compute revenue was up 45% year-on-year. Full-year Data Center revenue rose 125% to a record $6.7 billion, including almost 70% growth from data center computer. From a sequential perspective, the Data Center compute's stronger than expected double-digit growth more than offset the anticipated decline in Mellanox revenue, which included a large non-recurring network sale to a single OEM in Q3.”"
NVDA the # 1 !!!!don't be afraid just invest!
only reason I am not buying NVDIA is because I Got in at 160. if you are not long at this prices you don't like free money.
Patience and let your winners run. The road to success.
The pattrn on NVDA per Cramer is it goes down for a couple of days on great earnings because most people cannot understand what is being told them. You gotta be an advanced technical engineer.
Should be in the 300s by Friday and 200s by the end of next week.
Stonks are going A LOT lower. We are in inning one. Thank the democrats who are worried about men playing women’s sports and using the woman’s room
"And then, gonna try and use NVDA/tech to prop it up. Thus the staggered approach. Then the bottom drops to 250."
"615 to 460 since last week 6,500 shares $155 x 6,500 shares Skiing  or fishing ?1,010,000 loss just in NVDA this week Free-DUMB it’s going to $299"
Holding 22 units of NVDA Has been stagnant for a whileBut it’s gem and will touch $600 in 2 months
"I bet we will be up regardless of what the nasdaq does, tomorrow. Keep the faith, longs. Nvidia is the future of many things."
Major buy orders coming at 2.30 pm. My sell order of $525 will be filled. watch and learn. Kevin's pantiiiies are going up to his/her shoulders.
"@LarryTheLegend no wonder no one listen to you. according to you, NVDA will fall like it did last March. do you have any idea what happened in last March or do you need a lesson for that?"
RED WOW
Just like clockwork!!!!
"@Kyle if I were you, I wouldn't be talking, how's your prediction for today going? exactly"
"yeah. not new news: When NVIDIA launched the GTX 1050 Ti in October of 2016, Obama was still president and Samsung’s fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 was the biggest tech news. Now it seems that this relatively ancient GPU is coming back due to an acute shortage of GPUs, PC World has reported.NVIDIA confirmed that it was “meeting market demand which remains extremely high,” by re-releasing older GPUs including the RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti to its board partners. ..The GTX 1050 Ti launched at just $139 but is currently selling for well above that (i just checked. cheapest price on amazon is 261). Meanwhile, the RTX 2060 launched on the market in early 2019 for $350, but can be found on NewEgg from $800 to $1,644, not exactly an affordable price point for most gamers.New NVIDIA 3000-series GPUs are all but impossible to find, simply because NVIDIA can’t get enough GPUs to keep up with demand."
It’s a beat!!!!!!
"Darth Trader at post #15,450! Still the record holder and employee of the year!"
Anyone remember $615 two weeks ago along with 16 upgrades to over $800 LOL 
What are the chances that the ARM deal will go through? I am optimistic and think it will go through. The only reason I feel that way is the Mellanox deal was approved and that wasn’t too long ago. With the process being fresh and the players are basically the same after a lot of noise from the competition it will be approved but only with enormous promises to England that it will still be a major part of their economy with a new facility and the retention of a majority of the people already in place. How are the other longs feeling about this EPIC deal that will make us a boatload of $$$$?
Sell the weekly 600 calls all day long and make 100% once again
I love  when the CEO says how great things are BUT sells $1b in stock $100 higher than where the stock is now
Recent history says great ER leads to selloff - just look at Aapl - msft - pton - etc ...
"Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley, I admire him, is expecting a 10% correction in February-March time frame. Be careful trading."
Nvidia's data center sales probably slowed down because of Intel's much better Xe SG1 for dedicated Server streaming. Costs much less.
"did you know that 80% of the homeless nowadays collect govt disability checks every month?ssi/ssdi did you know 80% of the homeless have severe drug/alcohol addictions?we and the govt policies are now enabling severe drug/alcohol addicts to further their downward spiralwhen you talk to veteran street and drug counselors, the number one recommendation for any addict is to cut the money off govt disability rolls have created far more harm than good"
NVDA is $582 right now Just read 50 more posts that it’s going to 700-1000Just watch her drop now
Darth Trader and Legend trying to make people short the stock. Do something more productive. We re holding long. You can go on with your day.
This is a great short today. It looks like 540 is in the cards for today. Massively overvalued here.
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL NEW SHAREHOLDERS! I BOUGHT THE OTHER DAY AT $539. I AM GOING TO PUT IN A LOW BALL LIMIT OFFER TOMORROW. I LOVE DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN IT IS THE BEST INVESTING STRATEGY THERE IS. BUY GREAT STOCKS DURING MARKET SELL OFFS.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
ARK Funds bought in a lot of shares recently... I would trust Jensen to lead us to $700 soon. My opinions only. Best.
"Kalpesh (rookie novice) 615 to 583 since mall call, and you are asking me about down $50 in one day? It’s down $32 in two days! Did you sell the 600 weekly calls for $20 on Monday? $0 now"
"If NVDA plows through Kevin's hard ceiling at 540, his kids may need to go back to public school and eat in the cafeteria."
Why own big tech anymore? They all smash earnings and sell off. And people wonder why people are buying gme.
"bitcoin is an abominationto produce one btc takes the equivalent energy of an months usage from an average householdbtc doesn't add anything to global economyall it does is consume great gobs of energy to further its calculations that aren't applied to anything other to make more btc and i hope a movement takes hold that asks nvda to stop supplying crypto miners, especially btc"
"Just a temporary dip, no big deal. This is a strong growth stock."
"Very good buying opportunity for the long-term.Trust NVDA and you will be rewarded. Long since 2017, seen the very worst (crash of Nov 2018). The best is yet to come.."
We should hit $504 today. Please trade accordingly.
Intriguing... As long as they hold an edge on competition.
Nvidia is holding up with good support at $501. It will not go down that fast shorties
Buy and hold!
anyone see under $400 tomorrow? I do too! Good luck to all who listened to me for the last 7 months 1000 posts per day begging you to short
NVDA newest quote: “Down 40 dollars a day keeps the doctor away.”
"NVDA is like Cramer's Bear Stearns and Lehman, buy, buy, buy calls."
The beauty of this $200 fall is there was only one downward gap with earnings and it really wasn’t big @ $580 got to $574 and traded $602 in after hours so I am not sure if that was even a gap
NVDA went from $300+ last March to $180 or so this March $615 to $299 without an uptick
I was able to feast on discounted Nvidia and $AMD shares this morning. This is what gets me up in the morning which is opportunities to buy undervalued semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies at favorable prices.
Buy any weakness. Nvidia going to double. They literally cannot keep up with demand. Nvidia chips are in everything.
It must be because data center has slowed a lot. Intel is probably doing it to Nvidia with its Streaming Xe-SG1 server cards.
Bye bye $600’s foreverAll 600 call options since August $0#FACTS NVDA was $589+ in AugustIt’s $598 now NASDAQ up 5000 points during this time
$600+ stock $10 from NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!ROCKET TIME
"KevintheLoooooooooser is SalamanderJohnson now. $590 looks good to me, called it 3 hours ago."
Up 1.6 %......BIG DEAL
The ARM deal is issue. NVDA going down. Not a buy at all.
earnings come out at 5pm EST. that’s another 40 minutes away. be patient..
"My youngest daughter asked me what i do for a living since we are @ The Breakers for nearly a month $2500 a night, I told her, “short Nvidia.”"
either we see $560 tomorrow or $590. that's whats going to happen. market is unpredictable at this point
I cashed out 20% of NVDA and rolled it into CCIV / lucid. They are using the Nvidia drive chips.
Nvda still a buy at all time high
Google and Microsoft joining QCOM in blocking ARM deal. Oh no !
GREAT DAY TO BE ADDING SHARES WITH THE OVERALL MARKETS DOWN.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE INALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN.
The double top ( monthly) was obvious. Good company but even at 250$ it would be valued very rich. So 3 times tripple top with different ascending patterns at 596 and now 550. This will go lower
Did you all really think  NVDA was going to trade higher two days in a row? Hasn’t done that feat in well over a year #FACTS
Creepy Joe says buy NVDA if you want a stimulus check...
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Longs: the stock has to rally $50 after earnings LOL to break even from yesterday think about that
This stock since July has been nothing but an ATM for insiders. How do you get rich in the stock market? By selling
$615 to $548 in a week Told you bad earnings were leaked So simple yet so easy
200 day moving averages is breached going to $299 next week
This lead brick  balloon is going under $300. Chip shortage is now a glut. Heard it here first. When that news hits NVDA will fall $200 overnightv
I plan on selling one third of my NVDA at 648 in after hours because I bought so many during the sell offearly yesterday.
"As a long-time NVDA holder, I am shocked that it is red today. Nasdaq is flying and pretty much everything is green but NVDA is red? As far as I know, everything in the last qtr earnings looked great. So, what is holding this stock down? All I can think of is that there is some institution that is either unloading a ton of their NVDA holdings or they are shorting the heck out of this stock right now. Either way, I'm assuming it's just a short-term thing and hope it starts moving higher soon."
no way this opens down $20 after this recent quarter...big boys trying to pick up cheap shares after hours
Sheesh down $100 in 11 days.
Zero volume rally totally meaningless Will give it all back tomorrow on double the volume Volume never lies ever
Can't wait for the non believers to cash out.
$567 is the most beautiful  double top formation I ever saw
TIME FOR THE NVIDIA ROCKET TO TAKE OFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!!!!$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!
I sold my shares 2 weeks ago to Cathie Wood at $555. Who is smart now ?
$615 - $550 = longs R.I.P.  DOA 
NVIDIA is up 4.91% to 570.35
$605 to $573 is “only” a $32 intraday crash  which is only in the 1st inning of the sell off!
540 end of week
LOL I AN HAVING A GREAT TIME HERE AT LAKE TAHOE!!!! JUST GOT DONE CROSS COUNTRY SKIING! GREAT EXERCISE! I SPEND AT LEAST 190 DAYS HERE FOR TAX PURPOSES TO ESTABLISH RESIDENCE SO I DON’T GET TAXED IN SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA. SO GREAT TO BE TAX SMART AND INVESTMENT SMART. BUY NVIDIA AND HOLD AS LONG AS YOU CAN!
NVDA down 5% is it’s best day in a month
"Also from Motley Fool:Not surprisingly, the demand for the A100 GPUs was reportedly exceeding supply last year. A ramp-up in production bodes well for NVIDIA's data center revenue, which accounted for 40% of its revenue in the fiscal third quarter and recorded a massive year-over-year jump of 162%.-----Bears call the stock trash and wonder why it goes up so much. 162% increase is not trash. Demand in data centers will only increase in the coming years, and that's just one area they are involved in. Do some research."
graceful exit yesterday at 521 on expiring calls
Blow out earnings from Nvidia. They are selling all they can make. Assume your positions.
"I’ve been abusing the stock FSLY just like I do in here, began shorting at $80 all the way to $120, the whole time they all laughed at me, take a little looksie now, they are calling me a genius. Same exact thing will happen here. I don’t randomly short, I pick stocks where everyone is bullish."
Less than 1% away from the all-time closing high of $582.48. Half an hour remaining ... hmmm.
"I have been saying it for weeks now, if you own any stock ARK does you are R.I.P.  She will soon lose 50% and fast plus redemptions and outflows her fund will be Chapter 11 by April"
selling here makes little sense to me...i shall hold
NVDA weekly 550 call options are down 85% today and there were HUGE amounts bought
Anyone remember $519 here? LOL Now the round 2 of pain begins FreeDUMB bragging ???
"If you didn't get in at $600 when all the analysts were calling for $700 and $800, now is the time."
"Urging patience here. Lack of clarity on the outcome of the ARM deal and supply chain issues will drive this stock slightly down or at least keep it sideways for the foreseeable future. Even though the last earnings beat EPS forecast by 25% the stock has been trading sideways, up only $9 from the last ER. We saw a run up to $582 then mass sell off down to $510 before stabilizing after ER around $535. That was with expected and delivered GOOD news. This time we're expecting bad news, like the continued supply chain woes, or any failure to blow EPS out of the water will drive this much lower than $510. Plan to purchase more around the $480-$500. Just consider it a late Christmas present."
Just announced. NVDA will be on CNBC tonight. They'll be talking about their Blowout quarter. Good Luck
NVIDIA TO $750+ BY NEXT EARNINGS.
"It goes up because new short positions been sold, you have to buy before sell!!"
"So I’m 23. I went all in on call options. $36,000 in total contracts. Not sure how much I just made but I know it’s a lot"
"Watch my AVGO next week after earnings. Cheap valuation compared to NVDA, will make 52 week high. Buy now."
all gain of the week wiped out during 1 night  ..... redicolous
Unbelievable
"Motley Fool article this morning:""Nvidia's strong 4th quarter still underestimates its potential"""
"James Dontino, calling for $675 target price."
"The Chinese EV’s are going with NVDA chips. That is a humongous market. We are just scratching the surface of how high we can go. Add to that Gaming, Data Centers, Crypto Mining, AND the #1 Artificial Intelligence Company and yes a $1000+ stock....... eezy peezy. "
"When ARM deal reaches, it hits 1 Grand."
Let’s play the newest version of WTR called WHAT TIME $504? 9:31am EST
"Let me repeat the question, willtori1 is undervalued AMD worth $300s?"
"a nice bounce back todaybadly neededlooking for more follow thru over next couple days overall, going higher"
This game is rigged and I am sick of it. Target beat and raised but the stock is falling? It doesn't make any sense.
"Without an Intel Chip, there cannot be an Nvidia chip. PERIOD."
LET'S GET A FEW NVIDIA ROCKETS LAUNCHED.NVIDIA EARNINGS NEXT WEEK FEBRUARY 11.NVIDIA TO $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS
One hair out of place in earning We tank for the third time in a row
"Makes sense, now time to short, we are going back to normal, demand for PC will drop, since people will start travelling again.That's why the drop in NVDA post reporting."
"Normal reaction to beating by 10% and raising Guidance by over 10% would be a nice run up. Not this time. I can't tell if NVDA is getting caught up in the tech sell off, or if its just overbought, or if its sell on the news. The overall reaction was to raise guidance. Seems like the average is about 625-650 A few 500's & A few 700's but to drop 25+ after this Q seems odd."
"  PLEASE READ THESE #FACTS: Guys like FreeDUMB constantly point out NVDA was $180 or so last March, well it was $300+ before it fell during the fake Covid scare, so basically it went from $300 to $532 as of this morning. Not even up 100%. I own a stock named Penn National Gaming, it was $3 in March, not one of these BS Reddit stocks, it went to $130. That is an increase of 4000% since the Covid lows. NVDA is a massive underperformer no matter how you slice it. I can name 5000 stocks that are up twice as much as NVDA"
Long and strong. Forecast now even higher....
$700 by next ER.
NVDA weekly 550 calls down 70% today. Did anyone see the volume on those the past two days? Tens of millions worth all used toilet paper 
Kids were betting with me. It's heading to 472 support and then 336.
"I don't understand the concerns regarding the chip shortage as this will be gone in no time. Of course, this affects the SP temporarily, but it is limited to some weeks or at maximum for 3-6 months. But what happens when that shortage is over; in the meanwhile price per unit go up as well due to higher demand, therefore revenue should stay almost the same. This means NVDA should not face a huge loss or cut its forecast for the long term. It's like people think the factories burned down."
Breakout at 520 and we're off to the races.
Yesssss WHAT TIME RED? Lol felt it at 535 in my inner loins going back to 463
way overdone!
Another Fantastic Day amigos 
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!ROFLOL!!!YOU CAN'T BLAME ME IF YOU DIDN'T GET IN. I HAVE BEEN SAYING DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN SINCE 2016 WHEN IT WAS $25.CHOO CHOO!
"Welcome  all from the gorgeous Breakers Hotel  my tan is unreal while all of you longs sit in your parents brown paneled wall basements from the 1970’s, as i vacation on your “dime”. Thank you "
Now the profit takers cash out....
How is that upgrade with a $700 price target  treating you all???
NVDA shareholders are the worst: They are actually “bragging” & “cheering” that the stock is now “only” down $12. Do you all reside in a trailer park in Florida?
NVIDIA is down 5.46% to 471.26
too bad im running out of cash to buy more nvda
"LOL  I wanted to “test” out Yahoo cancel culture leftist weak algorithms so I posted a fun blog about our new chief in charge, POOF, erased, cancelled"
NVDA short $536 is my #1 short ever in 30 years
"So I'm a gazillionaire, and I'm thinking hey I buy 10K shares of Nvidia for 5.5M. And if I got today's low, at 545, maybe I was sitting on 50K profit. And then I'm thinking how much do I think this will really go up even with earnings, it's all priced in. Maybe it goes to 650? It's not worth 1K for a gamer card stock. Even making $100 on my shares is small compared to other higher gain and I have to risk it's going the other way. I'd Sell."
I repeat 472 is around the corner. It's going to fall big time.
Nvidia has gone back to its roots as a gaming company. Doesn't deserve this high valuations as a gaming company. Maybe $100 stock.
been saying that for a while now: tsla is a bubble that will weigh severely on the nasdaq during bad market days. Hopefully we see some recovery end of day or tomorrow. Nvidia is still on its way to report their best quarter ever imo tomorrow after the bell.
Saying anything against the new us administration gets censored
here we goooooo...
Just might see $550 at the open
Rare opportunity to buy THE chipmaker of the future at a discount. ..with both hands today.
"More on Orin and Adam ? Nvidia has been on that path since late 2019, when it unveiled Orin. According to the company, Orin is designed to handle myriad applications and deep neural networks while achieving systematic safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D.Leading up to CES 2021, Nvidia disclosed that leading Chinese EV makers Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng were developing their intelligent electric fleets on Nvidia Drive. Nio and Li Auto will use Orin in their future vehicles; Xpeng is producing new EVs based on Nvidia’s Xavier SoC.At a recent event, Nio unwrapped its ET7 sedan, slated to ship in 2022. The car will feature Adam, a new Nvidia-powered supercomputer that uses Orin to deploy advanced automated driving technology.“Every carmaker that has a desire to develop a Tesla-like software-defined vehicle is turning to us,” said Nvidia’s Shapiro"
"pull back completely normal, off the races next week"
stock is being priced like the ARM deal is going to get squashed.
NVDA $615 will be written about in history books  when the stock is at $0.
You regulars are still here!? Interesting.
gonna be below $500 this weekend
"Selling today at $573, that's gonna hurt...."
WOW ITS UNDER $500 NOW ISNT THIS A BUY NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION? I HAD THIS PRICE POINT OF ANYTHING AROUND $500 AND IT WAS A BUY LAST YEAR SHOULDNT THIS BE A BUY EVEN NOW???
"Well; account back to end of Nov value.....actually, still up +50K considering that's what I took out to buy a 4 Runner TRD Pro. But the way gas is going up in price (thanks Sleepy Joe); I'll need to find a good camping site in the back country to hide from the wife until NVDA rights itself. 650 in 5 months; hopefully they get smart and split it when it's back to 600 to at least make it ""appear"" a more appealing buy."
"Look intently at this picture NVDA $614.24 vs Undervalued AMD $92.03, do your own homework and win."
Anyone here going to give me any credit here at $504? How long have I guaranteed it? Now $488
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!DON'T BE LEFT BEHIND.NVIDIA $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!
"Have $1,300,000 in buying power freed up, shorting 1500 more NVDA here $525, and buying $20,000 per week in put options for the next 2 months"

All I ever care about and dream about since July is $504 gap
500 next stop folks
"I'd just like to thank EVERY Quick Draw McShortWIT(Kevin) out there for putting the most Dynamic, Future Tech Integral Company ""ON SALE"" tomorrow... following a spectacular quarter....Seeing them cut their P/E in HALF A Sincere THANKS!!!!"
"Great results, muted response. Long term up though"
Hey jagoffs. Bet those $800 upgrades feel real good in your backsides BWAHAHAHA
I think tomorrow will open 560 and goes to 570
"$NVDA supplied ... this ..

Any one know why JenSen Huang doesn’t do CES 2021 video?
"Quadruple witch is staring at NVDA, on to $525 in the next 2 hours."

WHERE ARE ALL MY HATERS AT $615? Anyone “should have listened to Kevin”?
"Free-DUM how are those 6000 shares doing, most bought at higher prices I keep track"
Hey longs it’s like a nightmare you can’t wake up from. On its next double digit run up I’ll short AGAIN. Letting you know now. Listen and you’ll make money. Don’t and sit there and eat it.
"Will be back at $600 very soon.GPK, ready to breakout."
No one needs NVDA chips except almost everyone. I have never lost a penny short selling this junk stock that I will admit. Listen to me when I say this stock will close below $380 today because I wouldn't lie to you.
AH don't mean much. No volume . Still their best quarter ever. And they raised . 6 upgrades at least before the weekend.
From 615 to 463 and not one uptick. 463 to 519 and already a 20 downtick lol  gap 463 needs to be filled trade accordingly
Like I said 1000x NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite! This is now 1000 stocks blowing out earnings and tanking! We are in a tech bear  market! Buy AMC BA oils etc
Gap at $504 and $532 need to be filled
This will go back up. stop complaining
@TrapperKeeper12 > I'm still waiting for your clear explanation on why NVDA is a $35 stock. Give us some of your wisdom
"Good news is for me I work shorting NVDA basically for a living, that’s all I have done everyday since August 2020 and R.I.P. the stock in here 24/7; think  HUANG is happy he sold $1b in stock above $550?"
One trillion dollars. Soon.Nvidia is king.
GME up 100% today due to short cover
great earnings
Looks like the pending 4-1 split I predicted has traction(cough). Hehe 
"""Kevin"" go show your postings to your parents and caregivers see what they think"
NVIDIA..what a fantastic ER and good job. I added more more when dip after last ER. It was a wise decision. Surely I will do the same thing this time. this stock is a long term buy and hold for sure.
They should rename this company YoYo.
"""investors""that followed CRAMER this week got killed...nvda, crm, etcHe is a scam"
"futures ripping, especially nasdaq futures. Looks like we’re gonna continue with this momentum upward. $NVDA $WIMI $BA"
Nice rebound on heavy volume. You can't keep a good thing down.
We haven't heard from Needhams Rajvinder Gill yet. He is the authority on AMD.
At this time next year nobody would have heard of Cathie Wood. Mark this post.
Pain beyond imagination  begins in 2 minutes! I feel so sorry for anyone stuck long!
another great day! thank you!
LOADING UP MORE EVERYONE.....GREAT CHEAP PRICE NOW....BUYING ON DIP....
up when market down. Larry not satisfied 
"I told you, weeks ago to dumped Nvidia when it was $620- 610, 500, 590, 550. Undervalued AMD is 100x better investment than NVDA."
Lisa Su (AMD’s CEO) just interviewed on Mad Money. Says chip business is booming and chip shortages great for business. Tremendous demand-higher prices———->. NVDA soars 
Buying short term calls... what a joke this last week has turned out to be. Stock trading bots are out of control... My opinions.
Commie CEO should have split this but that isn’t part of the game plan. He LOVES these $20 daily drops so his corporate buddies make bank
I may close the short 585calls today. I’ve drained 17 contracts at $15 per. Thanks.
6 Analyst so far adjusted price targets today with average low projected of $616 and an average high of $680 for those 6 adjustments.
NVDA has to rise 25% to get back to where it was last week LOOOOOOLLLOOOOOLLL
Go dowwwwnnn damit
"If this corrects again tomorrow like the past 2 trading days I am going to begin adding aggressively.In increments.......but aggressively. The stock is now in bear territory having corrected over 20% in just weeks and after supper earnings quarter. Will, also, include Broadcom."
So great to be short NVDA the second the market closes it gaps down then gaps down on the open by $10 like clockwork
"Buyers rush in for shares @ 525! They rush for NVidia. The plandemic is here to stay 4 ever, so work@ home and games instead of long flights ( evil evil co2 ) will be there to take over the analogue world we leaf behind. Prepare for a new HAPPY live in a virtual reality ."
is it bingo time at the home when they all scream bingo at once especially the twins
$615 to $467 this week and I haven’t covered a single share. Will hang on until next March long term short. Already owe millions on my cap gains for my put options
"Just joining YF Message Boards. Mkt pulling back big time these last few days. This gives us an opportunity, if you have the dry powder available to add to names you like. $SNAP at $60 is nice, as is $PINS in the low $70s. $SQ, $NVDA, $TWLO and others have meaningful upside as the market looks past temporary 10yr bond yield rise. Also like $TSLA. This is just a pullback, stick to your guns and add to names you like long-term (if you have the cash available obviously)."
"If the QQQs go fill that post election gap at $276 it'll be another 8% down. If NVDA went down another 8%, we're looking at 440ish. At this rate, that doesn't look unrealistic at all."
Pain hasn’t even begun yet. Wait until $299 this week. Buy every put option you can get your hands on
To the MOON !!!! 
Will close below $500 a share today. You should sell now and wait for sub $140 share price.
This stonk NVDA is R.I.P.  Anyone in at $602 last night in after hours?
Just too easy
Still think huang doesn’t orchestrate manipulation? This is why it hasn’t split. All the big holders benefit from this huge volatility
The 15th time NVDA has been down $20+ since July 
"Kevin, are you going to be 0-4 this week to date? I know you are losing big on GME and with your calls this week for NVDA, getting close to the time for you to go to bed Sir! :-)"
The institutional buyers are going to use every trick in the book to get these shares cheap before the ARM acquisition is approved.
This is an echo chamber of day traders #$%$ off to every 0.01% price change lmao
Heading to Sandpearl resort for lunch. Thank you NVDA for all the profits.
Short life savings CRWD PYPL NVDA TSLA This is the most money I have ever made in a day in 30 years of trading
QCOM CEO “If not for supply constraints we could have sold everything we made.” You will be hearing the exact same story from NVDA since TSM is also their chip producer. QCOM down 10% so NVDA will fall minimum $50+
When ARK Cathie Woods and Cramer are both long a stock sell it hands over fist
7 trading days ago this was $615. Nothing criminal to see here. Keep it moving

Nvidia will close in green. The upgrades today are massive. We even got a new street high of $800 from Needham. Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
NVDA down $15Will be down $50 tomorrow on AMD newsPlease trade accordingly
Everyone here listen to my inner loin short 513 cover 463? See my GME 182 to 220
"Did you think Qualcomm would smile at the Nvidia-ARM deal, huh? Or Intel? Of course they are angry. Nvidia is stealing their lunch. Nothing they can do about it though. The deal will go through. Nvidia is king. Soon to trade in the trillions."
Wow. $611 to $600 in literally one second. Not the type of stock you want to own into bloated earnings.
Just remember this everyone: last earnings NVDA blew out earnings upped forward guidance huge said “running on all cylinder” AND the stock fell from $540+ to $510 the next day!!!!!!!!
"Why in the world  honestly explain to me why anyone would ever own a stock like NVDA at $545 here? It’s already had its run. It’s never going higher. You are never getting rich from it anymore. I understand buying at $10 to $100, BUT why would anyone not sell here and buy something else?"
If they investigate Nvidia and arm for anti-competitive problems they should investigate the x86 Monopoly that's been dominating the industry for decades.
Still remember KevinTheLoser who once said that his shorts vary from $468 to $589? Although he still has his shorts from the 180s not covered yet. His shorts are officially 80% losses. More to come.
I am thinking about picking up 50 shares of NVDA today while hoping; a) the share price will not go much lower than the current $550; and b) that the earnings announcement tomorrow will be good. Good entry point or am I catching a falling knife?
Has NVDA ever been down $15 and gone green? Never! I can name 10 instances since just July that it’s been up $15-$20 and gone red 
"Option expiration, no one is going to hold over the long weekend. $590 here we go !"
"All institutional and retail investors dumping shares will squirm in agony when the ARM deal goes through and Nvidia obliterates it's ATH. I've been in many companies that drop 50% or more, only to double or triple in the following years. It doesn't take a high IQ to do well in investing. All that is needed is a strong stomach, lack of emotion and common sense. Sometimes it is wise to go against popular opinion and make your own path instead."
Never seen it's so cheap to buy after its e/r...it's time to buy more on low and sell high as long term.
Keep thinking there is no manipulation. Never buy/trade with your heart . RULE #1
be ready to hear from shorts again :-) LOL
Weren't we supposed to go fill the gap at 463 today? Bwahahahahaha.
Made 1000% so far in 7 of my put option positions expiring Friday and haven’t sold one share of one of them @ 517

$20 daily drops are the new norm. Thanks huang
$600+ very soon!!
Looks like Kevin is wrong again. How is it humanly possible for someone to be wrong 100% of the time?
$5 GONE!!!!!! BWAHAHAHA
I have seen a lot of things BUT I have never seen a stock fall $50 on blowout numbers NVDA had......
"I see Qualcomm is rejecting the ARM deal now, not good  at all for the future of NVDA R.I.P.  I see we are all back to the usually NASDAQ up 20+ and NVDA red. So simple yet so easy. Will be $504 after earnings, down 20% bear "
Just drove my Bugatti to my Gulfstream on my way to the Maldives  (all paid for by my NVDA short).
Up 10% today
I think $543 here is the forever high in NVDA. Trade accordingly
Zero interest at all in NVDA going MUCH lower
"While Merrill Lynch raised the price target on NVDA to $625, they also downgraded dot-boy, Legend, CrapperKepper, Darth, and NG to reprobates."
UPGRADES comming along tomorrow the way it should....
"Already going back up. Record earnings, possibly some upgrades today or Friday. And definitely hedge funds jumping in"
even if US10Y rose to 3% it would have no effect on cash cow like NVDA. TSLA investors should be worried though
How come Kevin didn't mention we might fall? lol Anyway just added some shares at $512.99/share. Volume is light across most semiconductor stocks including Nvidia. I'm nibbling on delicious offerings as in the price comes in again.
"WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!! CONGRATULATIONS TO ANYONE THAT BOUGHT AT OR BELOW THE 200 DMA. SCREAMING BUY ZONE RIGHT THERE.

Are we cruising past 580 today? I think so.
"NVDA is acting exactly like FSLY & QCOM before earnings. Down 40% and 15% after earnings. You see rookies, earnings are the great equalizer"
"Tanking next week....no way stocks survive a bond maiming, BTC crashing etc. More pain to come...."
Down $40 tomorrow.
Last August NVDA was $589+Now in mid February it’s $598Bank  checking account pays more
There really should be an IQ test before you can buy NVDA stock.
"This sell-off after a strong quarterly report is unfortunately in line with what other companies are seeing. While a few have seen price surges, many companies have not been rewarded by earnings beats. It's baffling, to say the least."
What are the odds that the NVDA and ARM merger will be allowed ?I am having trouble wrapping my head around this. Any opinions would be appreciated.
Big funds are exiting market. Check the sudden drop on the opening. Everything is included in the earnings. Be safe. I am buyer after correction. The correction hasn't started yet. I will not touch over 336.
I would short 514 here with every penny to my name if anyone is long here. Trust me
"Any chance we can drop $50 to $100 today? Anyone here remember $615? My god, honestly, what were you all thinking?"
"Benjo bashed it in the low 500's too btw, check posts ...Benjo:"" I know nvda very well"". Yeah right. Bad track record."

mission control all systems green for takeoff
So much for never seeing $500 again. It is $501+ AH now.Nvidia is king. All hail the king. To one trillion dollars and beyond!
Analysts are going boost the target to 700 to 750
"Be honest, anyone in here able to recall when NVDA was $500+? ROTFLMFAO "
YES  Just got filled. My largest short position ever @ $521! Thank you dear god

Welcome to the 600 club!
Have great weekend neutrals and longs! Nvidia is king!
"$580 is a “lock” today, which would be $9 lower than where it was last August! Nice  “investment”."
"Great days ahead. Love the gyrations, need down movements to buy more shares and make more money. Looking good for a nice $10+ move tomorrow."
Who is going to ever buy a stock again that fell $150 in a week on great earnings?
100% chance NVDA tests $470 after earnings (please save this post)
I don't think we are done here yet. Congrats fellow longs.
Great opportunity to buy at the open before it goes up sharply

this is better this is progress
"By the end of March I think  NVDA, in looking at the options, could possibly, with some luck, hit $550"
"Could we possibly see $504 FINALLY today? When it fills that gap down from $615, what will you all say to me?"
it is heading my forecast $103
Motley Fool army is going to push this thing higher and higher...just like LMND and OPEN.

Down 3% after hours is hardly “crashing” except fir day traders
I sell the weekly 600 calls massively every week for 7 months never even came close to losing once with the stock in the $500’s the entire time
VALUE OF NASDAQ DAYTIME W HIGH VOLATILITY MAKING NO SENSE AS MARKET COULD SWING IN EITHER DIRECTION FAST UP $100 POINTS IN NO TIME...HOLD ON...
Let me repeat the question NVDA $474.61 or Inferior Intel or undervalued AMD?
#FACTS: NVDA is now lower than where it was last August 2020
@ Kevin... how many barfing posts are you going for today? Don’t you have a job? Or maybe this is your job...
"A quick napkin calculation for Salamander shows:100’s of borrow days on 18 short lots. With close to $1 million shorted (minimum 1800shrs x avg $531 at 1.8% avg borrow rate), Slammymander has gushed $5000 in borrow fees alone. Those are spent. In addition the position is $135,000 in the red. If on margin as Slammymander Kev says, the margin call is this week."
Almost reached $498 but no cigar yet. Daddy needs $499. Let's go !
One year low after solid earnings ALLLLLLRIGHTTTYYY THEN
"Better chance of hitting Powerball MegaMillions 100 weeks in a row than NVDA ever trading higher again! Save this brilliance please! If NVDA found a cure for diabetes cancer AIDS SARS Bird Flu Covid-19 heart attacks strokes, the stock would still go down"
Retest $467 by noon ?????
LRCX...can't make chips without it.
7 months of gains wiped out in 2 weeks... good lord
is nvda good to buy now for long term? newbie here. thanks
look all im going to say is NVDA is the future that will help the future be a better future!BANK ON IT!
Longs: is anyone adding more heading into earnings?
Everyone on here is holding. I queried last summer.
200 day is now broken  and it’s a Friday sell now or you will get margined out $299 or bust next week
so gaming sector is booming and autonomous ev sector as well .... 200$ down in no matter time is way to much smells really fishy  GME soon will be worth more than nvda .... this stock market is trash and fake manipulation they will value my old shoes more than nvda and amazon combined soon .... redicolous.....absolutely redicolous..... 0 sense 
"Be honest, anyone here old enough to remember $614? I don’t either to be honest!"
NVDA shareholders @ $615->
NVDA has literally zero support. $490 was her last hope. Could easily go back to $100
Time for act two. Let’s see how that useless PM indicator holds up. That being said....”What time RED”? Huangs buddies need some more of your money
growth stocks getting whipped like rented mules
Anyone remember the NIO collaboration? LOL  $66 to like $35 on NIO and NVDA $615 to $460 since the big hook up! I remember thinking  they will both eventually drop 75%
"Keep an eye on the QQQs. If it breaks 300, it'll probably go fill the post election gap at 276 and set the tone for the whole tech market. That would be another 8% down if thing dropped by a similar percentage."
Getting pretty sick of the DOW going up every day. That and hearing about Kevin's loins.
amc poppin
I just saw Ford is cutting back their F-150 due to supply constraints with the chips in their trucks. NVDA is going to get beat like a red headed stepchild on earnings day due to not being able to make/sell enough chips
buy the dip! $TSLA $APPL $NVDA $AMZN $ETSY
4X/week BWAHAHAHA
"selling volume is lower than buy volume, maybe a bit of manipulation here?"
I just love knowing every call option buyer is broke
Shorties need to realize this stock is solid as a rock and will only go up for the rest of the year when we're done with panic.
"NASDAQ was up 400 yesterday NVDA was barely up $5 with an end of the day last minute fake rally, NASDAQ down 100 now NVDA is down $10"
"The $NVDIA partnership is wise. The best possible partnership for $NIO. What should we achieve with Apple what we aren't already making better and in the original? Yes, this is the beginning of a golden age and a golden partnership. LETS GO"
Almost 60% upside according to Needham. It's not a matter of if but when. Needham thinks it's this time next year. Cause that's how price targets are set. Forward pe is now 35 while growth is yoy over 50%.
Wait how can anyone say anything about this awesome company? If your long which everyone should be always in amy stock they invest in whats the worry? Semiconductors are on fire massive demand little supply=massive sales. End of story
Nasdaq down over 400 points and NVDA at lows of the day is a BUY on the dips in this area. Good Luck
you think our twins keep moving the end zone....time for art class
shorters will get burned. This is why you dont only graph trade.
"-22.83, my favorite lottery numbers."

"I repeat  for anyone now officially a bagholder of NVDA stock: NO STOCK FALL $40+ INTO EARNINGS EVER, THEN RALLIES AFTER EARNINGS, NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY ARE!"
NVDA bagdolders conference scheduled for Thursday Feb 25. Pls bring in your own coffee and chair.
NVDA is going to $504Just watch$589 to $595 since last August
$618 was hours ago. BWAHAHAHA
Easy $400 target breaking support
see.... another day low
"As a rule, I do not believe in conspiracies. That being said, it seems like a lot of negative news that impacts the stock market often happens at the end of the week. Yesterday, the big story was the rising bond yields. And now the bombing strike in Syria.Two negative stories at the end of the week. Many people may panic and sell today because they do not want to""hold over the weekend"".Sometimes it seems like these events are orchestrated to cause a selloff. Just saying."
Will see $1000 quicker than you think
"Consolidation is over, this is going to be 800 by earnings."
"Institutional manipulation. They waited for the good earnings, the stock goes up and then they sell the heck out of it. How else could the price drop so hard and fast?"
I am shorting $492 here and buying 480 puts expiring tomorrow
cover yet shorts
Why the massive rally today ? thanks
$567 LOL  Now that is hilarious  Doesn’t anyone know the golden rule? What is it? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
"Anyone not short with the NVDA 600 puts into earnings is so far beyond a TARD that they can’t possibly be helped. Load up  da truck . Not one stock has rallied after earnings, especially fabless chip stocks like AMD QCUM & INTC all dropped 15% after earnings, which would be $100 for NVDA! Load up on the 600 puts into earnings, you will make a small fortune "
"pretty sure NVDA has gone down nearly every time it has reported earnings, and look at where we are. in the current stage of time with economic uncertainty and corona,it's a norm"
This run up is awesome right mario? 
At $481.99 I told a loser in here NVDA would trade $299 before $482. It fell $10 without an uptick. Also at $557 I told someone it would trade $504 before $560.
You all laughing  now at my inner loin 535 & 513 shorts? Does anyone in here have any clue of how powerful I am
"ok profit takes subsided and ready to roll!nvda jus got an additional $500B in addressable mkt - EV, autonomous driving, smart grid tesla autobidder, expansion of crypto, cyber security AI chips, new generation switching fabric, 5G and 6G wireless, solar and on and on"
All of 2020's winners have become a source of funds to buy Chevron. It's really quite remarkable.
Kids were betting and laughing at me ? I trade with conviction. I see 472 to 336.
It will be 700 in a week.
VIPUL is 100% correct. Why would you ever hold a stock that literally falls $15 almost everyday?
"I never thought I'd be saying ""Hope it gets past 500!"" again."
25% in a few weeks! wow. not sure what to think. good grief
"both amd nvidia asml & tsmc shareholders.Nvidia (Nintendo Switch, Benz) is the King of GPU period yet AMD (PS5, Xbox, Tesla) is catching up really fast."
"With an ER like this and forecast and completing the ARM deal, they could be a $1000 per share company by the end of the year, if there isn't a split before. This is a good win for people who own it."
"I would be very interested to get a midday report from the Bash-Boys on today's performance of Nvidia, and when it will turn red?"
Certainly looking forward to another blow out earnings report!
Great exit stage right here
Anyone heard from Sal/Kevin/Legend?
"Dealer informed me my new gas guzzling 4Runner arrives maybe Friday. Thankfully I don't need $$ from NVDA, but those Covid relief Biden Bucks will help pay for his soon to be $5 gas."
BMO Capital just raised NVDA target to 680 and keeps strong buy rating.
"Ignore all the ups and downs you sissies, that is how a stock market works, all that matters is where you buy and sell in the end, if you can't stand Volatility between trades go invest in a CD"
Helicopter money has arrived. Futures up. To 700 we go.
I am getting tempted to buy at $515 for a quick bounce tomorrow. All I need is $520 open.
NVDA is only down $105 this week and people are complaining what rookies just wait until 275

"Qualcomm, Microsoft and Google are being just a LITTLE bit hypocritical. Qualcomm has paid their share of anti-trust fines, and both Microsoft and Google have their history of buying up other companies and trying to crush competition. Aside from pushing AI forward - Nvidia is already a leader in AI without Arm - they'll be competing with Intel. As for Intel, they're getting into graphics cards. Nvidia and Intel are also competing in cloud data. The real battle shaping up here seems to be between Nvidia and Intel.Jensen has said that he would maintain Arm's neutral licensing model. Moreover, not only has he said he would maintain Arm's current operations in the UK, but expand it. The Nvidia website states:""Opening the AI research facility for collaboration with UK industry leaders addressing the world’s most pressing challenges.""""Expanding research partners within the UK through research fellowships and partnerships via the AI research centre.""""Helping UK start-ups grow through access to the Arm supercomputer, NVIDIA experts, technical training and marketing promotion.""Seems pretty clear that he would agree to stipulations that would address most concerns. As for export control, which would be China's concern, Arm CEO Simon Seegar stated that it is ""...governed by where the technology is created in the first place. That doesn't change with the change of ownership of Arm.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8HTfQi548The US would not be able to restrict China's access to Arm because it is British. In other words, this is a non-issue. The US could ask the UK to restrict Chinese access, but that's politics and could happen with or without the deal. The US and UK are close allies. That is something China will just have to accept."
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY TODAY. NASDAQ SELLING OFF DRAGGING DOWN GOOD STOCKS. BUY NVIDIA. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.
the Giant is awaking. I guess every long is happy today to see it finally reach a new high after so many months of hibernation.
I made mistake by selling half of my holding at 200 because of panic selling. Al gore did the same mistake.. Now its 600. I still hold half though.

Got my $495. It's a beautiful life. My dog got a treat as a bonus.
These daily patterns are far to common
Anyone buy GME 10 days ago @ $39 like I begged you to OR NVDA @ $615 like I begged you to sell???? Asking for a friend of a friend.
Guys like me control stocks like NVDA it will be red today at one point save this brilliance
"K-Dog is making the calls!Violin, start serving us drinks!!! "
Pure Manipulation. It will reach $600 in a couple of days.
"37 point gain incoming. No moon, but good enough."

NVDA will be up 650 soon!!
"If you look at history bull markets take up +90% of time , bear markets usually are merely small corrections. That's why the indexes are always up if you go back a year or more in time. Duh. This will be short lived. Roaring twenties are up."
"This stock is looking attractive everyday. 24% discount from it's all time high. If this drops another 10%, I may have to sell my car and load up."
KEVIN PLEASE GO AWAY
"Here is what happens: A stock runs up huge for no reason like NVDA longs and shorts panic buy 615 it drops to 550 right before earnings down $65, then you are basically forced to hold into earnings and BAM  drops another 20%, look FSLY $122 last week, $100 into earnings $80 now"
You don’t just go up like that without people going to jail. To prison they go.

$589 to $595 since August when the NASDAQ was 9000. Let that sink in. #FACTS!!!!!!
Very bearish charts. Read it..duffers.
are you guys holding?
NASDAQ up 322 and NVDA at the lows of the day. There is a chance it falls $50 again today
Anyone pay $515 this morning? LOL  or $615 two weeks ago? $463 today
Now we see if Kevin the liar posts again after the 463 gap fill promise goes limp.
remember 5% in the red today as my supercomputer suggested
imagine shorting when the rsi is the same as it was in the march crash
I still can’t stop  laughing that someone paid $611 today and said they were impressed by how well the stock was doing after the big run up
Like a bad dream huh 
wow I think it's a great price for buy back !!!
The American Rescue Act is law now so expect $$$ from direct payments to find a home in growth stocks as soon as the treasury starts sending out the $1400 per head direct stimulus payments. Hold on to something we will be heading higher.

"It was worth 510 25th of august after Q2 beat (we got upgrades) then they raised and beat Q3 (we got upgrades), then they raised and beat Q4(we got upgrades) and they raised ....They can't keep this down forever. This is not a stock like tesla that trades at a pe of +1000. Buying on every dip because of years of spectacular growth ahead."
"At crazy times like now, after hour trading is not to be trusted, lol."
days end 515
"I am sure ""Legend"" is getting very nervous at this point as now is back up to $554.70 at today's close. Hope that he has covered some of his shorts on the way up. Never have understood the stress of short sellers and surveys have consistently shown that short sellers lose over the long term. Me, a few years back after downsizing ,and being retired looked around for some good growth stocks to enhance my remaining years found NVDA and a few others. By remaining long with NVDA and its 1,500 shares my profits to date exceed over $700,000. Could I have increased that gain by playing 'shorts'over those few years? I doubt it and the stress and risk of wrong short term decisions over that time would no doubt have destroyed the joy of retirement......better to head to the casino as at least it would have been fun playing. Anyway, longs stay firm as NVDA is a great company with the best products. AMD, had some of their stock but quickly realized that their products, mainly CPU's have become almost obsolete and they have hung on and gained market share only because lousy management by Intel allowed it. NVDA has no real competition and won't have any for a number of years, maybe never so hang long!! Every market they deal in is the future of technology, medicine, entertainment, eCommerce, problem solving etc. If you are into stocks it doesn't get any better than that!"
"all bubbles will deflate by 90%, this one by 50%"
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!NEXT STOP $750 BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS.

Lows of the day on a +230 ........AWESOME.
Stimulus got passed. Market will rocket  to the sky Monday. Nvidia is well sought stock. Even today it was a top recommendation list . Yes last week was tough but life has it’s ups and downs but stay focused and stay invested. Next week market will be up big time

HERE WE GO BABY 589 BREAKOUT
Path of least resistance is up. I see a rally to $560 today. Boy would I hate to be short this stock right now.
Anyone who is long NVDA over $480 needs a lobotomy
Wonder what would have happened if they didn't blow by expectations. NVDA now trading at early 2020 levels
Kevin loves filling gaps so we filled the one at 520. Now it's time to fill the huge one at 615.
really wanted this puppy at 500+ by eod bummertook the money and ran on 490a near double wanted more should get a better entry on expiring calls early tomorrow
that was a satisfying day
Tomorrow the blood bath begins NVDA R.I.P.  I say at one point NVDA will be down $50
NVDA down $50 tomorrow Pre market would get me to cover 1/4 of my 27 short positions
We need Needhams Rajvinder Gill and Hans Nosesman to give this an extra push today. Come on out whereever you are and pump this stock on CNBC.

Big firms did not invest billions over six months between 520-550 for gain of 20. Smart investors know time for the run is here.
"Treasury bond yeilds rising is bad for tech and growth stocks, has nothing to do with the individual company. If you are long on NVDA long term hold but no matter how good earnings are, if the Nasdaq continues to slide it doesnt matter"
I repeat 472 to 336.
Anyone notice INTC is at all time highs? Was $40 when NVDA was $600+ now INTC is $65 and NVDA is $499
Ignore the premarket. Look at GME judging by its momentum Nvidia has a good chance to be red again. Last time GME took off it hit the broad market.
@Legend continues to be so wrong on everything. Consistency is his/her strength.
EXACTLY $100 lower LOL  from where NVDA was two weeks ago #FACTS
Looks like market movers are repositioning after pumping so much. They know what move will be profitable. Sentiment with a stock does not help
"Clearly people have learned nothing from the GME fiasco. Far too many stocks are priced beyond fundamentals, like NVDA for one, and people keep buying it. LOL!"
"Rarely do you get such 25% pull back in such a strong company.Here is where analyst currently stand after the outstanding earnings report just the other week:Nvidia price target raised to $800 from $700 at Needham, BUYNvidia price target raised to $700 from $600 at Raymond James, OutperformNvidia price target raised to $700 from $672 at TruistNvidia price target $680 reiterated BUY at JefferiesNvidia price target $675 reiterated Outperform at Evercore ISINvidia price target raised to $665 from $600 at Cowen, OutperformNvidia price target raised to $660 from $605 at JPMorgan, OverweightNvidia price target raised to $650 from $605 at Mizuho, BUYNvidia price target raised to $640 from $600 at Wedbush, Outperform"

"Has anyone seen or heard from the CNBC talking heads today that have been telling us that high growth tech is history and that the no to low growth ""value"" stocks will rally for then next 3 years? They seem to be missing today."
"I told you all at $580 after earnings when it dropped $50 “if a stock isn’t going up on good news, it’s going down.” Why wouldn’t you all short? I don’t get it, it’s the same as being long BUT it falls 100x faster than it rises. Stairs up elevator down"

"Why SENS NOW? I really like this Biomedical scientist explanation. “ I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond."

"Makes one wonder how long the manipulation can continue....forward PE is at 30 btw...""BofA says buy AMD and Nvidia as Steam data points to GPU upgrade tailwinds 10:20 AMD, NVDA, SNE, MSFT BofA analyst Vivek Arya said his monthly analysis of Steam gamers' GPU survey highlights ""a robust gaming environment"" with scope for further GPU upgrades.

Arya reiterates Buy ratings on both Nvidia and AMD given what he sees as the GPU upgrade tailwinds."""
"August 2020 NVDA was $520. We are now in February and NVDA is $520. Six months sitting in a $520 and you haven’t gained a penny. Oh yea, the NASDAQ rose almost 40% since August. Any questions? Asking for a friend."
"John Lawrence, of Cobra Kia Investments,believes in NVDA."
"Crypto miners are blood thirsty for GPUs. Gaming is as strong as its ever been. Why not buy NVDA now before you have to pay $700/share. Get in, stay in. Remember Nvidia stock has NO TOP !!!"
"What happens if Bitcoin wasn’t $60,000? R.I.P. NVDA forever! Sell $520 and NEVER look back ever!!!"
Over 600..... I can breathe again.
Nvidia has started to break down due to it's high valuation and future growth prospects. Short term the stock may trade below 500 until major support around 450 to 475...
I see it at 336 support.
Anyone see my GME $74 to $150
@Kevin > Don;t forget your promise yesterday:Legend18 hours agoMy GME and NVDA hit $500 tomorrow or I never come in here again. GME will rise $300+ and NVDA will fall $30
NVDA now firmly under all its moving averages except her 200 and that’s coming real soon  then it’s going back to $300
road to recovery begins
Top semiconductors stocks to buy in 2021 article by Jon Markman. Nvidia is on top of the list
"It's not even trading like they missed , it's trading like they reported a loss. While they had their best quarter ever and raised next Q expectations. Fact is that the economy will recover this year and then I hope y'all loaded up as much as you could here."
"Uh oh right on cue, here come the “going to $600” cheerleaders"
Nvidia is a great company. I am sorry you are down big on it but i think that Jensen Huang is doing everything right but the stock has fallen out of favor right now along with many semi stocks. I have to urge patience; this is a terrific long-term investment
"All Shorties, game over soon."
"NVDA has gone from 615 to 515 without an uptick and the NASDAQ is still 13,100. I would say longs are R.I.P."
I don’t have a lot and am in it for the long haul. This drop sure is a bit unsettling.
Anyone here notice the direct correlation between EVERYONE in this forum getting real bullish after one good day in 7 months and the stock immediately tanking?
"I for one is of the opinion that Nvidia will hit $1,000 soon. And I have been mostly correct in the past"
"You'd think with all his millions, Kevin could get laid instead of spending 23.8 hours a day on this forum."
futures looking great
Overpriced total overpriced.
Last March NVDA fell 50% I warned you all 1000x it was happening again! Ask Zoom  shareholders when they will see $600 again or SNOW $430 or TSLA $902? Try never! $615 is the biggest pipe dream ever created
"Cathie Wood believes that deep learning could create more ecnomic value than the internet did.

Good earnings will be reported today. Then the nose dive over the cliff will happen.
Has anybody noticed how often Jensen underestimates projections? I can't remember the last time they missed.
"NIO and Nvidia? Shorts and bashers are going to love this.. NOT!SHANGHAI and SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NIO, a pioneer in China’s premium smart electric vehicle market, and NVIDIA announced today that the automaker has selected the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality.

Good Report; Good Earningsand down we go????
"NVDA announcing the NVIDIA CMP, or, Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, product line for professional mining."
Oh my God Applied Materials beat by a pretty wide margin and gave a very upbeat report. Applied Materials makes equipment which makes chips. They also mentioned chip shortages. Applied Materials up over 5.0 % in pre market. WOW. Love the chip sector. Buy individual shares plus FSELX a semi conductor mutual fund offered by Fidelity. I am sure other families of funds offer a semiconductor mutual fund too.
"NVDA better start producing some chipsets soon, or this stock is going to tank to $100"
"Chip Shortage + Cannot keep graphics cards in stock = no profits for NVDA... great company but this is going down, ill rebuy at 400 lvl"

"$MSTR is just smart! Buying Bitcoin woke up the miners. I own $BFARF, $DMGGF, $HUTMF, $HVBTF, AND $BLOK. $HUTMF already owns over 3000 Bitcoins, but $BFARF and $DMGGF have just started banking coins themselves, following $MSTR's lead. $MSTR is a little high priced for me, right now. I am still looking for that 1000 percent gain. Hopefully, these miners will get me there, and quickly. Then, I will have to add $MSTR to my portfolio. I did own it back in the day, along with $QCOM, $NVDA, and $AMD; however, I had to get out. Good to see $MSTR going back up! Any company holding bitcoin is going higher and higher without doing anything. How cool is that?Good luck!"
You ok bears?

So INTC is down 10% on record earnings that will take NVDA down $50+. Save this brilliance
NVIDIA partnering with $NIO is HUGE news. Welcome to the NIO family guys!
NVDA was $512 in July 2020.NVDA is $512 March 2021.My checking account paid more.
Okay longs consider the following scenario. You are trapped in a world of collapsing growth stock values when suddenly a worm hole opens up offering you a fleeting chance to escape the misery. Do you go through the worm hole not knowing what awaits you on the other side of the worm hole or do you stay inside the shrinking technology stock collapsing universe>? The worm hole being any day the stock is up. The other side of the worm hole being any other NON high growth technology investment. Choose wisely grasshoppers.

"I put in an order to buy 200 at $470, went out to walk my dog, came back and it filled. Yes I can ! Looking to take profit at $495 and will ride out my $513 buy. Too easy."
"Day traders fix this stock each day buying into it and then cashing out. It's tiring to watch since it makes up the highest volume of my main fund. Oh well, its doing well right now but it used to be at 584 at its high. It's been struggling to get to 550."
My name is rider
very bullish day. let see if we can do a back to back tomorrow with some follow thru
"Cramer tweeted ""nvidia is a good buy at -5%"". Well it certainly is even better when it's down 8% then. Gonna watch Jen's interview in a few hours at ""mad money""."
"KEVIN TODAY, ROFLOL"
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. NVDA will be $460 tomorrow night. Supply constraints. Everyone knows that though earnings leaked 3 days ago @ $615
Either new tripple top #$%$ or new double top at 540 range. There are NO Buyers for this overpriced stock!
"Cov 19 is ending....it's time for money to rotate from one sector to another...nvda benefited a lot from cov 19...people abandoned work and stay at home playing Nvidia powered games...now they need to get their a...back to work...airlines, restaurants, amc will do better next..."
If the car industry is booming then why isn't there a shortage of other parts. Wall St wants the Reddit traders to squeeze the shorts in the chip stocks.
Still crying laughing  just thinking about $540 yesterday morning. What were you all thinking?
The easy money gravy train is now officially over. Time to reapply at McDonald’s
$504 again I still can’t even remotely comprehend how this was ever $519. That’s the forever high

NVDA down $85 this week and falling no bottom in sight!!! R.I.P.
You want to hold NVDA into earnings? Look at QCOM wow  NVDA will be under $400 soon!
"Believing and catching this great opportunity low price, buy more and holding, this should be the right way of smart investors...not to get panick unless not knowing how to invest in stock."
"Target up from 600 to 700 by earning, chip shortage led to more demand then supply n crypto hype increase demand of nvda chips to mine crypto"
"Nvidia Up 128% up in a year, since market crash in last March. It will be another 50-70% up with arm deal and new gpu's. Great stock. Great company. "
Anyone see KevinTheLegend? That guy is amazing! He was never wrong once for like 6 months. I sure miss him.
Few hundred shares traded around 568 giving impression it went down. Going up to 700 by end of next week.
@SalamanderJohnson worry about your bank account instead of NVDA. Still up $50 for the week. Rest in peace
NVDA shareholders tomorrow night will be all trying to squeeze out one small door at once all at the exact same time @ $460!
"As is always the case, its going down faster than it went up."
Anyone think a stock split is on the horizon? Asking for a friend!
Hope these earnings are through the roof. Anyone taking a chance of selling now and seeing what happens? This could go to 650-700 in a blink.
Oppenheimer raised it's price target on NVDA to $700 
AH means nothing. Only regular hours matter...
This will never dip under 500 again unless the sky falls down. And I doubt that. There are always individuals who think 500's is not a bargain. While I think we'll see 700 somewhere in august. That's 3 earning reports btw. Sorry is always late.
All shareholders of NVDA holding since July $589 NASDAQ up 5000 points are LAHOOOzERS
Making the call NVDA falls under $500 today easily just watch this blood  bath 
"AMD, MICRON, TAIWAN SEMI, TESLA ALL DOWN MORE THAN NVIDIA.BUY THIS MARKET CORRECTION.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.IF THE MARKETS SELL OFF MORE BUY MORE."
"over the long haul, nvda is a must own hands down the best in semi sector"
Don't be greedy. You can never go broke taking profits. There are plenty of other fish in the ocean.

added more...this is a gift with blowout earings in 48 hrs...
"I am surprised by the Nasdaq bloodbath but I guess it was to be expected. Good play by all you shorts that had the timing right. Like any other phase, we get past this interest rate uncertainty, get the stimulus passed, get the vaccines out there and things should go back to an uptrend. Why? The fundamentals are there for growth. This company is still solid. The one nice thing about being long, I can hold and wait it out. Shorties, enjoy the day. Hopefully you made a good chunk of your money back with this one."
"Hey kevin, rumour has it, the repo man is on his way to take your Bugatti away. Do you have any comment?"
LADIES & Gentlemen boys TARD LONGS AND GERMS  what time blood  red today?
Nvidia's HUGE dinosaur chips days are numbered. Intel Xe will arrive soon to make the dinosaur extinct.
will nvda hit 640-650 on earnings/outlook? oh boy
Nvidia lost marketshares to Intel in graphics. wccftech has the report.
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Any questions from any new bagholders?
look out shorts and scare mongers the NASDAQ went GREEN
AMD is red now. Be careful. Greed is not good.
"shook out ALL the weak hands, LOL"
Closed 28 points under the 200dma.
"shorts, I'm guessin' easy 535 today, higher also possible. Should have bought more short term calls when it was at 470's but my leaps are doing great as well."
$615 was what...... 45 minutes ago? BWAHAHAHA
How those “futures” looking? Who would ever hold any stock over the weekend? Amateurs
wake me up when its $700 .... 02/24 :)
There is a better chance of winning Powerball 2 weeks in a row than NVDA ever hitting even close to $600. Save this post.
LOLOLOLOLOL @ all the people on these boards that think every decrease in share price is because of shorts.
Tech stocks are like market heroin. People can't resist buying them.
"added some, we're down because of some other stocks being overvalued and dragging the nasdaq down on a blood red day, look at tesla eg."
Stock expected to Blast Off following earnings release on24th of this month. One of the best Growth Stocks anywhere.
80% (32) of all analysts have a strong buy/buy on nvidia. 20% (8) say hold (7) and only one sell. They're increasing price targets by the day.
NVDA 800 by july. CALLED IT 8 MONTHS AGO!!!!
On useless days like this an options expiration Fridays I go play golf and do not check the market. It has served me quite well for the past 11 months to accrue a nice bag of cash.Add in a dovish Fed and I will patiently hold.Staring at a ticker all day is what these manipulating miscreants want you to do.Have a great weekend AMC bulls.Also a quick shout out to my other favs after AMC.Long and strong $AMC $NIO $BRCX $PYPL and $NVDAGo out and enjoy life and patiently hold onto your shares.
"Honestly, NVDA is the only stock I have ever seen where the bag holders are cheering “down only $15”."
We’re up 17% YTD. We will be up 100% +. like last year. Clearly the Class of the Chips in What 2021 has been deemed The Year Of The Semi’s. As good as it gets compadres. 
"I am now officially down to ONE NAME, “Legend”. Like Cher, Elvis, Bono, Whitney, Prince, etc. I may even expand on my name one day soon to SIR LEGEND, after getting knighted"
Nvidia can't make enough GPUs to keep up with demand.
ARM deal update coming with earnings. 11th is earnings date and I see $600 on the 12th.
Did you all forget NVDA fell 60% last March! Guess what month is almost here? Lol 
Great opportunity to buy more!
Why is it only 1% not 10%? any explanation
"I don’t think  NVDA will go back to $180 Covid March low BUT I do think it will go back to around 400 or so; then again $467 yesterday is already basically $400.........Like AMZN NFLX NVDA etc all FAANNG stocks that “stalled” last July, this is a real problem, they never rose when the market went up, BUT are the first to crash  when the market goes down"
give me 510 today
This STONK NVDA never goes down ever! Kathie Wood  ARK like $615
Anyone doubt now that MMs are manipulating the price pre-market and AH ?
GREAT CEO....will be positive CC. Will be listening.
$600 tomorrow guarantee
"10 yr is about to come down anytime now, according to its rsi"
"$615 to $570 right before earnings is NO BUENO! The “overhead” pressure on the stock is R.I.P. to all longs, no matter how good the earnings are. Know how many RobinHood rookies are margined NVDA into earnings? OMG "
What time red????? Any good  guesses? 9:30 AM EST
NVDA producing all it can 24 hours a day and still can not keep up with demand means NVDA earnings and revenue will go above all expectations.
Everyone listen  to me please: Short NVDA here & buy the weekly 500 puts expiring tomorrow
Celibration Drink
This is where you need to question why did you invest in this company to begin with.Did anything fundamentally change? Did anything happen from last year to today.... if the answer is no. The dips deserve to be bought.
Pretty impressive price action for a friday. Monday will be very interesting.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
i want that 30x gain on 490p past two days
NVDA will be down $50 today by the close. Save this brilliance

If the ARM deal goes through do you know what the price will be on the stock? Maybe 900/1000
Just shorted more NVDA $547. Thank you  god.

Can we get 550 already
Numbers will be good. Guidance will be poor and huang will misspeak again. This will result in a bloodbath AH

Kevin gets thought a lesson today! NVidia will never be under 500 again in our lives
550 today
Where are the cheerleaders with their Pom-Poms?
NVDA is peaked for now.
I am out. Thank you NVDA. Going green soon.
Merrill Lynch raised it's price target on NVDA to $625
Will Nvidia be around 5 years from now? Tech moves very fast and everyone has GPU's now including some chinese companies.
Crazy market! Like the up days
Good lord these markets tanking in literally a few seconds is so rigged and criminal it’s absurd. It’s getting worse. SEC really needs to start clamping down on this. Only big banks reaped any benefit to this massive drop that quickly. The manipulation is NOT a free market.
"NVDA easy a $600B company! cripto, cloud, gaming global explosion and it offers the best chips in the mkt, order pipeline never ending"
"CNBC:...Ultimately, Nvidia sales were up 61% year-over-year.Investors had been expecting revenue growth over 55% from last year and Nvidia beat those expectations, even during a worldwide semiconductor shortage.Nvidia also suggested that its hot streak would continue by forecasting $5.3 billion in revenue for the current quarter, ahead of investor expectations of $4.51 billion.(5.3 billion is 17.5% higher than the previously expected 4.51 billion. And, NVIDIA will beat 5.3 billion)"
About those 600calls. Where is that ^IMOTHY kid. Is he with the option kid splitting pudding today?
Thank your new president for that.
we go up tomorrow boys
Oversold. It is plunging because they make a ton of free cash flow in growing business segments? It is trading below enterprise value because there is no future for a company like NVDA? I’m going contrarian.
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE!HEADING OUT TO ALPINE MEADOWS FOR A POWDER DAY. WE JUST GOT SOME FRESH SNOW IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC.LIFE IS GOOD MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS! LIFE IS GOOD!BUY MORE NVIDIA ON DOWN DAYS, DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN."
"Arm deal is happening, Nvidia never said they won't continue to provide licences for the arm technology to other tech companies. It's just Matter of the time. Future is really bright for Nvidia."
$521.85? REALLY? It has to be fake news. Anyone remember $589 last August THREE BLOWOUT EARNINGS AGO
I honestly don’t think NVDA will ever trade higher ever again this $540 area is the forever high
Hock Tan of AVGO and Lisa Su of AMD are much better and less flashy CEOs than Huang of NVDA.
650 within a week after earnings report.
"If AAPL went from $145 to $129 after earnings $112,000,000,000 in 3 months, with no supply constraints, tell me how NVDA stock is going to do?"
All part of investing all part of investing. Baron’s had a lead article today on how phenomenal NVdia’s ER was. I subscribed also to JC and he just released his two Best Buy’s as Amazon and Nvidia. My personal belief is this price action is all contrived to shake out weak hands and then the big money buyers will pile in. Seen this movie many many times. NVDA is still the same great company it was yesterday. Actually based on that ER even better. Market manipulations notwithstanding 
P/E 70 for a hardware manufacturersure buddy
"Well last earnings the stock was $545, so almost even Steven"
Anyone like NVDA here at $480 in after hours down $13 OR $615 last week bwaaaaa

NASDAQ +400NVDA up a pennyCongrats  to all long and call options buyers R.I.P.
Was there any doubt NVDA was going to crush their numbers? No doubt here. $$$ stock will be over $600 tomorrow. $700 in March.
Congrats to those who bought the dip at $591!
I am pleading & begging everyone in here to sell 521 and get short it’s going to $300 down 50% without an uptick like last March
Nice manipulation by hedge fund longs.
"I was in another forum with another junk garbage  poop  stock like NVDA down like $100+ this week, and a kid said he’s $300,000 on margin praying the market goes higher or he will lose everything! That’s who is investing! Sell NVDA tomorrow open and short to $300. Fell 50% fake Covid last March and going to fall 50% again to $290"
"I just freed up another $1,304,000 in shorting power on margin so here I go $486"
Where would NVDA be if they missed earnings and guided lower? $300?
Alert  warning  THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF HITTING POWERBALL & MEGAMILLIONS THAN NVIDIA EVER TRADING HIGHER EVER AGAIN
nvdia will be in apple cars & phones
Once 200 day breaks it should go to 299 in a week or two
"How can the bashers on this board say this is a garbage stock when earnings were through the roof?Scratching my head, though, on why this is down so much?Hmmmm"
more cowbell....FREEDOM where is more cowbell? :-)
Wheres my Pepto Bismol. I'll need double dose today.
Sal after the 20% run up....
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite...........You all been studying  this AMAZING equation since July/August of 2020. My team of advanced Ivy League educated mathematicians came up with it. No charge to you!
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
Look at big tech earnings. Data Center results set to explode for $NVDA. And gaming revenues to hit new high due to the holiday season.
NVDA still down $30 from right before earnings and still down $50 from last August and $65 from last week. ANY QUESTIONS? Asking for a friend.
Nvidia earning great. Head fake after hours. Get in early for 5% surge Thursday
You all like 615 last week or 460 now?
"in my mailbox from Cramer: ""buy broadcom on earnings disconnect"". I think there are better options when it comes to companies who were disconnected with their earnings."
"So 99% of the “people” in here, and I use the term “people” very loosely, think  NVDA is “going to $700”. Reminds me of the QCOM forum at $170, right to $140 like clockwork!"
Do you all remember the day recently when the NASDAQ was up 500 and NVDA was up like a penny the stonk was $554 that day. Dropped $60 straight dollars since
Gonna close my group down soon. If you like Cramer see my FB group Action Traders. Must be a US Resident is a minimum requirement. I am trying to help the average guy. I might ask you a question.
I'm swearing lol honestly
"I think NVDA goes from $606 this morning to $460 this week. I have been saying that for months. Buy $50,000 worth of the 500 weekly puts for pennies, sell them Friday for $40!"
market pullback = opportunity to buy. pullbacks are normal. don't miss the boat!
Larry is over at GME board perhaps
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAS VEGAS,NV! HAD TO FLY DOWN FROM TAHOE TO TAKE CARE OF SOME ISSUES WITH A PROPERTY I HAVE IN DEVELOPMENT. WORK WORK WORK. THAT'S ALL I DO WHEN I'M NOT SURFING, SKIING, FISHING THE PLANET, SCUBA DIVING AND LIVE LARGE. LOLHEY!!! ARE YOU GUYS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS NASDAQ CORRECTION? THIS IS A FANTASTIC BUYING OPPORTUNITY. I HOPE YOU HAVE BEEN RAISING CAPITAL. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN! I JUST PICKED UP ANOTHER 500 SUB $470, AMAZING! ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MARKET FORCES TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. BUY WHEN THERE IS BLOOD IN THE STREETS. ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!"
"Expect to see a lot of shorts on the message board today with fear mongering.Facts:NVDA posted blowout earnings but being pulled back with over all market from 614 to current price.It dropped 3 straight days with yesterday down 5% alone with extended hours . These fast drops are usually met with big bounce backs especially after 3 days in a roll and now Friday with options expiring. And with Nasdaq down around 10% level as of yesterday, its due for a sharp bounce. Good Luck.Blowout earnings on all metrics: Adjusted EPS was $2.18 vs. the $1.24 analysts expected. Record revenue exceeded analyst expectations. Adjusted gross margin was much higher than analysts expected. Recently acquired Mellanox Technologies Ltd. helped drive revenue growth."
NVDA will never even come close ever again to $600 A LOT of bagholders from $611 wow 
Shorts
China Joey needs crutches/assistant to help him. He can hardly walk.
Keep it going!
These shorters will get burned soon enough lol. This stock will grow a lot over the next year.
"Nvidia price targets as high as $800, with average $638. Google ""WSJ Nvidia Research Ratings"""
I hope Jensen has some bright ideas to implement to stop this.... maybe a stock split?
OMG NVDA up 0.01 in after hours. Sell and short it 
Accumulate and buy in every dip
gave a buy call at test of pc yesterday gave a close out call at 521 todaywanted more kibble but 200% in less than a day is fine and nailed the 465 to 518 upmove
Never selling.
DOWN $100 in 11 trading days. Effuhuang
"Fasten your seatbelts this stock has bottomed out, now back to $600 ++"
$590-$595 close coming. Oh No !
"1,000% on nvda 3/12 500c in two dayssweetupside down a smidge on 500c reentry at retest of pc and didn't close out we'll see"
"NVDA expectations are way to low, they will blow past 5 Billion in revenue"
0% chance of closing over $500. Please trade accordingly. No one is holding over a weekend. Gap 463. Sell now so my weekly 510 puts I bought for pennies could make me $500k
"I keep trying to find a reason to sell but, have failed miserably."
Narrow trading range until earnings then great numbers and then the......... huge FLUSH over $20 AGAIN
GME is dropping faster than snow in Boston.
Does $NVDA own bitcoin or they produce and develop mining rigs? I just bought shares yesterday because the price bottomed and did not have time to do enough DD but also cannot find an answer anywhere. Asking for a friend
615 to 483 going to 450 tomorrow and won’t cover one share or sell one put unless they expire tomorrow. Waiting for $299 in March which is down 50% like last year
"$525 sell filled and I am still in my pajamas. $1200 profit, Sure beats digging ditches."
NVDA disappointed in crypto mining auto sales & data centers. Doesn’t anyone read the earnings report?
Watch this death  spiral close then wake up to lock limit down futures on employment numbers March crash  2
This stock is manipulated by the market makers. On Monday it jumps up 10 to 12 . They sell call options and on Friday no action. All the call options expire. This has been a trend for last 3 months.
sellers are loosers later as it 's leaving the train and moving up fast higher in just a moment...with tons of new upgrades today....to $700
$504 is coming and there is absolutely nothing that anyone in the entire world  could possibly do about it sorry to say please trade accordingly
Ouch! Good day to buy!
Will be “down $100” by the close! Good luck to all longs
The market did not reward NVDA for it's last earnings beat. Perhaps this time will be different.
market reverse .... back to real prices!!! BTW when the p/e ratio changed on NVDA ? just realised it today!!!
She’s going under $511 by the close. VIPUL you like $525 rookie or no? Inner loin 513 short cover 458!
Comes down to the guidance now. Nice beat up and down 
$610 and moving up
congrats longs.
Buy on the rumor AND sell on the news. Pre-market is just crazy. Great buying opportunity here. NVDA had a FANTASTIC quarterly report.
earnings will be a huge W. watch and wait
"Earnings report going to turn this train around? I wager the biggest problem NVDA reports is the same one they reported last call - ""unable to keep up with demand"". A real quality problem as Cramer said then."
A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL SHIPS. I'M HEADED TO KONA BIG ISLAND TO FISH FOR MARLIN AND YELLOWFIN TUNA. I HAVE PRIVATE CHARTER COMPANY THAT I PAY 6 FIGURES FOR MY YEARLY FLIGHTS (LOOKS LIKE I AM SCHEDULED FOR A CESSNA CITATION OF SOME SORT) TO AND FROM SANTA BARBARA/TAHOE/VEGAS/ CABO/NYC/KONA-KAUIA. DON'T BE JEALOUS. BUY NVIDIA AND GET RICH LIKE ME!!!!
"This market is so manipulated, this is a $1000 stock and on sale today. Buy, buy, buy this overvalued stawk. price to sales is still 25...should be 10 like AVGO."
"1 year ago the stock prices was 261, I think in one year from now the price will be 1000+"
The shorts are so afraid coming into earnings that they have to post every 2 minutes with something negative. Good sign for longs!
I don’t see any stocks ever going up again under this President
Last time it did this it dropped 200$.....qcom anybody?
"OK, IT'S TIME TO PARTY ON THE NVIDIA TRAIN!ALL ABOARD!CHOO CHOO! ROFLOL!"
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!NASDAQ DOWN OVER 300 POINTS!!!!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN GREAT STOCKS LIKE NVIDIA!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
just don't sell
$620 tomorrow. Nvidia simply manufactures demand.
"how to turn 5k into 10ml on two trades in three dayslast tuesday, with nvda at 550x buy nvda 3/5 490p at .27collect 8,000% gain last friday as nvda divebombed to sub 470buy expiring 3/5 nvda 500c at .25 with nvda sub 470sell at 10 with nvda at 500 turn 5k into 10ml on two trades in 3.5 days"
Easy 610$! Crypto and earnings play
The typical NVDA long
Are ‘.’ and DT on a 5150 Hold?
I have more money in my back pocket than Boeing will make over the next 5 years and the stock makes a 52 week high. Upside down market. Earning season starts next month and tech will take leadership again.
Just like J said ...see ya $600
Watch the cliff dive the last 30 minutes
Nice pull down action. There will be take off soon.
"Hey shorts, one single little bullish word from Cathie at ARK and Nvidia instantly goes to $800+. Just saying. Hah! Hah!"
Gonna break out this year.
all of a sudden NVIDIA multiple matters
"625 by earnings and 700 after earnings, 1000 after arm deal. Good game kevin!"
NVDA is the greatest stock ever to short I have been short huge for 6/7 months now and I never have to ever worry about anything it never ever gaps up ever only gaps down
I short NVDA on every uptick since August and haven’t lose money even once
NVDA 3/19 $700 call @ 0.60
Will be $504 sometime before earnings. How is anyone still long if they have any clue about charts moving averages & options?
just like that 600 is in the rearview mirror
Sell the pop open big tech is over
"Shorts our out in full force today. Drive it down so I can buy more. This is one of the best companies in the world, firing on all cylinders."
Is Everybody cashing out? can't believe it....
Is February 16th the same as September 2nd 2020 ? Semis made 52 week high and then collapsed.
Boards pretty quiet. Looking for a pre earnings push to the 540-550 range. Tomorrow with options may see 5 teens again before moving up. Good luck to longs. Selling calls in the 540 range selling puts in the 520range.
This thing better hold that channel lower boundary around $492 or it may go to $400 in short order.
Nvidia is imploding. Longs need to run for their life. Just admit to your family and friends you made a horrible mistake investing in NVDA. If they care about you they will forgive you.
"What NVidia really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for NVidia (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Just came here to laugh at larry
Why would anyone buy & hold NVDA ever when you can trade it and make millions
Kevin will never reach his only short position at 299. He has never shorted from anything above that.
Rotation into Pharma and dividend stocks such as PFE and LLY now the play
"Up in a down day, what say you shorties. Reporting all of you to my Reddit pals."
NVDA stock is a ponzi which will come to fruition on February 24
I will add on any dip below $525/share.
"I quadrupled my money at $587.08 but waiting for at least a decuple (yes, 10x) of my money. Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
Closing under $500 today GUARANTEED feel it in my inner most loins 
"as the long-standing market axiom states---where financials go, the market soon followsand financials have had a big time run up past month to new all time highs on xlfthat's a good sign for market"
nvda 2/26 550c just shot from .75 to 4.00 boom
"My analysis as to this selloff - One or more of the following reasons1. Retail investors/reddit selling before april 15 tax deadline so that they can pay taxes2. Investors rotating out of tech into oil and other #$%$ stocks3. Big players shaking loose hands so that they can buy in at low prices4. MMs causing weak hands to sell because they want to close out options cheap before ER5. MMs shaking prices to rinse and repeat what happened in March 2020. 6. Program bots selling based on treasury yield misfunctions and related #$%$7. Some investors worried about the crypto issues flashbacks from 20188. Some talk about the chip supply chain having limited supply9. Some talk about the chip supply chain having a ""glut"". See (8) - LOLFurther - It wasn't because that ER or guidance were anything less than stellar. It wasn't because the analysts are raising targets through the roofIt wasn't because Cramer wasn't talking up this stalk.It wasn't because Jensen was not hopeful on the ARM deal. It wasn't because ARK and other funds are buying Nvidia like crazy.It wasn't because there is a short supply and extreme demand for Nvidia's productsIt wasn't because the automotive, data center, AI and cloud markets are going through the roofIt wasnt' because the Pandemic is getting over."
It 'll be UP HUGE tomorrow as soon more upgrades comming along...due to great e/r....
Smart shorts will be covering today. Bull market back on
If NVDA doesn’t hit $460 within a month I will never post again
See ya $600
Two biggest rookies I have ever known: FreeDumb and Kelpesh. Two novice broke West Virginia Mommies basement rookies
RED RED RED I TOLD YOU ALL INNER LOIN 513 to 458 next week 100% guaranteed I will make another $1m plus in put options
NVDA tests its 200 day MA $460 next week at the latest
$504 here yet? Wake me up when it gets there today for sure. I promised you that gap would be filled easily even at $614
As predicted one hair was out of place RIGGED
"This next leg down is taking NVDA to $504 gap. Then $490 200 day MA, then $299 by April tax day"
why ever sell NVDA unless you were into retirement already..?
Sorry about the AH price action guys... happens with these overvalued overbought overhyped on CNBC stocks Check out PSTG (Pure Storage) while it's still under the radar. ARK is in heavy just waiting for it go mainstream. Get in before the talking heads on CNBC get a hold of it. Peace !
kevin and freedom are prime examples why chronics should be relocated to fema camps in remote deserts with no internet access
NVDA is really just back to where the stock price was 4 weeks ago. Not a crash. Be a buyer at $480
market manipulation.... ir worked back year ago it will work now again ..... simple way the rich making money....
Want to know why I make millions? I short stocks everyone is bullish and long stocks everyone is bearish on. These forums help me so much.
Bought 5 at 534 in November. Holding for 600 by year end!
I feel bad for the guys that sell at this point 
"Let's see $25 down day today. Yes NVDA can ! It was great trading this stock from $515 to $553, I am not touching it at this price."
I'm going to hold NVDA 20+ years.
Too afraid to look  saw the huge blowout quarter and raised earnings and trading $600 early in after hours is it $650 yet?
"So 100% of the people posting before earnings for AMD QCOM INTC all chip stocks were all saying the exact same thing they are saying in here. Take my advice, you had all better either sell or load up on put options into earnings this stock will drop $150 on supply constraints"
time to buy
PE still 90 and sales to market cap 30. Way overvalued. Most expensive chip stock.
NVIDIA WILL BE $750+ BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS
"you can expect a post from larry that says,""i just shorted at $597 after hours' LOL"
"Relax longs - ER coming up, I trust Jensen to give us good news... Best."
"there's been no correlation between nvda's pps and bitcoin the last 6 months, just sayin'."
"I PREDICT IN 3 WEEKS TIME, POST EARNINGS, NVDA WILL HIT $600 ! COULD EVEN TRADE HIGHER DUE TO SHORT COVERING."
TO THE MOON !!!!!!!!!! N️
NO stock falls $42 without an uptick right before earnings suddenly if they weren’t leaked.........
So $480 pre market what time honestly do you think  the $463 gap will be filled because there is no way in the world  it’s not eventually filled
i see 700$ coming!!!
"Anyone laughing at my inner loin 535 & 513 plays now? I didn’t think so. I hear rumblings that NVDA is going to warn next week or a major downgrade, plus the ARM deal falling through"
I will buy this dogsht company on its way down. Will add another 4-5 stonks at 400 and will buy 50 @300!!! EFF Huang!!
"I agree with Larry; the ARM deal will not go through and the stock will tank $100, BUT you know what, it might be a good thing, I am hearing there is a huge chip glut forming, too many chips no buyers"
https://screenrant.com/nvidia-rtx-30-gtx-rtx-20-graphics-cards-why/
NVIDIA IS BREAKING OUT!NEW ALL TIME HIGHS RUN TO $600+
"Continue to add shares, these dips will not last long... interest rate news will be short term noise...mm will be back here in days"
"Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is hitting new all-time highs (finally). Technically it did so on Wednesday too, but barely.The stock made a powerful move in 2020, but topped out in the summer and has traded sideways for months now. Earlier this week, it gave bulls a monthly-up rotation over $560.After a slight stall, shares finally powered up to and through $590. Now over $600, bulls are clearly in control.What we want to see now is for the stock to maintain over the $590 area, which is the prior all-time high and former resistance. If it can do so, it keeps the 161.8% extension as a possible upside target, up near $660."
100  upgrades and NVDA is collapsing. The stock is down $40 since July. This is a good company BUT time to sell
Do NOT SELL ...This got positive future growth Potential as will be needed in all coming EVs technologies as will hit 800+ with TSLA...
Can we get a wellness check on Larry? Watch for raised guidance on the earnings call 
Where you at Kevin/Sal/Legend???
we're off the lows on the nasdaq. Might crawl up even more. Fingers crossed.
"Coming out with a new book  if anyone is interested, called: NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite"
https://discord.gg/UzkWteuAgx
Wow this Larry dude should be nominated for the Darwin Award! 
I hope this continues to tank. I've been trying to purchase GPUs to mine and it's so hard to get supply
Inching up slowly towards Kevin's daily gap fill at $520.
"We'll see how options play in on this Friday; last trading day of the month. Initially hoped to see close to 590 today, but I have a feeling it stays pegged 545-555 and starts moving up next week."
If you bought on 1/27 for $513 your Happy!If you sold on 1/27 for $513 your sad!and that’s all I have to say about that.
Can’t wait to see up $5 pre market then down $40 by noon  CRYING LAUGHING 
I really just can't fathom anyone betting AGAINST this company? pick something else. NVDA has it's tentacles in almost every industry..
"nvidia is the next trillion dollar market cap stock, every quarter is a beat, every guidance is a raise!!!"
NVDA now down $65 from highs into earnings. Thank you Mario I shorted $563 on your “green” post! Doesn’t anyone in here have a clue about options? They control this stock
"All I can say is let the day traders play their games, may the best man win. In the mean time, I will hold tight and watch as I ride up and hold."
Holy cow. yeah I'm buying Nvda at 510. not many opportunities like this.
can this close at 510 on a 2pm to close mega buy in?
The only thing that makes me happy is that Disney sunk to 192.
"Nintendo has increased its forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31st to 26.5 million Switch units, also boosting its net profit estimate 33 percent to 400 billion yen, or about $3.82 billion. ... It was also a massive quarter for Nintendo in terms of software sales, with nearly 76 million units sold."
$611.50 inAH
Nvidia and AMD should switch color because Nvidia is red every day rofl.
"The re-opening stocks are already priced higher than pre-pandemic and some may never fully recover. Gains moving forward will be slow, like watching paint dry. Those that are accustomed to the rapid gains of growth stocks will become discouraged and return to growth. But the smart money never left, or added. Another move higher is inevitable. The recent drop was an excuse to shake out the weak."
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!LIFTOFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!EARNINGS WILL BE MASSIVE.BUY NOW!
"I can only imagine that options book kid. Leafing through pages madly trying to figure out what’s wrong. Oh well, those 585 were just an added bonus to the 600c pile on the short heap."
Still $615? Not near a PC. Anyone like my GME?
one of the great bargains in 21st century history
news about ARM deal and earnings are slowing leaking out......
BUY THE DIP!!!GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY TODAY! BUY THE MARKET GENERATED DROPS!!!!
New all time high after ER
To one trillion dollars and beyond.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.

"Just sold $10,000 worth of the weekly 520 calls for $1.40 So simps"
"I'm so disappointed with this stock. My stock portfolio looks pathetic and who knows how low this will go. I'm not selling cause it's too late for that but in the future, I'll be sure to be more diversified the next time around. I was too heavy in NVDA, bad mistake."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-china-chipmaker-gets-government-014938446.html
"What's behind the drop, according to this news article:Nvidia (NVDA) shares are lower following earnings that at first were cheered by investors who then turned cold on the stock.""The outlook for the all-important Data Center business disappointed on the margin,"" Evercore ISI says.Credit Suisse says the ""lack of DCG upside, Crypto uncertainty and ARM overhang will continue to be headwinds on the stock,"" referencing uncertainty about its planned acquisition of chip-design company Arm that is under regulatory review. NVDA is still a strong company with a coveted product line."

"this is what can happen when there is major rotation among asset classes treasuries gone bonkspowell's comments today really added to the furycaps the upside to equity markets as money rotates into cyclical, industrials, financials, etc"
every 3% is good for almost 20 points right now. It's good to be long nvda. Just lean back and let the money come to you in your sofa while the shorts are getting buried and lose their sleep and appetite for food.
Will Kevin’s Magic Formula hold up today?Or will he continue to amass losses on All of his Shorts???

"I love  the “perma bulls” they said “$700 after earnings” for a month, now the stock is down $20 after earnings they are saying “$650 by the close tomorrow.” The path of least resistance is LOWER"

"Nice momentum divergence in place on the intraday chart and held the lower boundary of the channel at $492. Hopefully, that was the bottom for now."
"Hope you guys bought under $500 when you had the chance. Won’t be seeing that again for awhile, if ever."
Only down $25Shocked how well it’s doing today actually Congratulations new RobinHood bag  holders
This was the final proverbial nail in the coffin  for NVDA will bottom $299 this year and everyone in here will claim they bought more every $10 down and originally bought at $1
"Some hedge funds must be closing shop , they are selling everything fast and furious, the price doesn’t matter they want out"
"Kevin has retired the name Kevin due to financial calamity and has re-named himself ""Sal"" in order to begin a new financial identity."

"I made one of my few mistakes by selling this a few years back at about 140 after buying at 180. No worries this time, even if it means waiting 10 weeks for the next ER."
Down $100 today???? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
I'll predict we open tomorrow at $625 and hit $675 by closing
I have a feeling that this will be close to $700 by Friday.
Which analyst will be paid to raise price 666 on Friday 355 pm
I think it is more than options expiration. Maybe the ARM acquisition.The ER will be very bullish.
"10 year at 1.30, Powell-Yellen are clueless. Order to buy 500 shares at $450, I will get it next week."
"Before last earnings in November HUGE numbers upped guidance NVDA was $545. Blew out twice, was $589 last July/August, now $530. LOL. You do realize FANNG stocks have been R.I.P.  for 7 months now."
 Nvidia just announced they are changing their ticker symbol from NVDA to TURD 
"Patience will be rewarded. Short term actions will not. Hold Nvidia long and find out. Not a pump, sell to your hearts content. What Nvidia is trying to do will take time and won't happen over night."
Watch the inevitable beatdown later in the day. The pattern of past ER’s will remain
@kevin > Looks to me like you will be wrong on both counts:Legend18 hours agoMy GME and NVDA hit $500 tomorrow or I never come in here again. GME will rise $300+ and NVDA will fall $30
even after amazing results stock is down. it is so disappointing
Pe should settle around 25-30. Still waaaayyy to expensive
"NVIDIA Unveils AI Enterprise Software Suite to Help Every Industry Unlock the Power of AITuesday, March 9, 2021Runs on VMware vSphere; Optimized, Certified and Supported by NVIDIA; Hundreds of Thousands of Customers in World’s Largest Industries Can Now Adopt NVIDIA AI Enterprise at ScaleSANTA CLARA, Calif., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite of enterprise-grade AI tools and frameworks optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA, exclusively with VMware vSphere 7 Update 2, separately announced today.Through a first-of-its-kind industry collaboration to develop an AI-Ready Enterprise platform, NVIDIA teamed with VMware to virtualize AI workloads on VMware vSphere with NVIDIA AI Enterprise. The offering gives enterprises the software required to develop a broad range of AI solutions, such as advanced diagnostics in healthcare, smart factories for manufacturing, and fraud detection in financial services.With the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, IT professionals at the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that use vSphere for compute virtualization can now support AI with the same tools they use to manage large-scale data centers and hybrid cloud environments. The NVIDIA software suite provides scale-out, multi-node, AI application performance on vSphere that is indistinguishable from bare-metal servers.“Until now, the world has run AI on bare-metal servers,” said Justin Boitano, vice president and general manager of Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA AI Enterprise enables customers to reduce AI model development time from 80 weeks to just eight weeks, and allows them to deploy and manage advanced AI applications on VMware vSphere with the same scale-out, record-breaking NVIDIA accelerated computing performance that’s possible on bare metal.”“Every enterprise is exploring how to modernize their infrastructure to meet the demands of AI applications,” said Lee Caswell, vice president of marketing for the Cloud Platform Business Unit at VMware. “With NVIDIA AI Enterprise and vSphere 7 Update 2, VMware customers are now able to fast-track AI in their virtualized data centers and easily deploy certified, AI-ready infrastructure for their modern apps.”Powering Advanced AI at Enterprise ScaleAmong the first to use NVIDIA AI Enterprise for vSphere is Optum Technology, part of UnitedHealth Group.“AI plays an increasingly important role in the data-driven services Optum provides for United Healthcare,” said Justin Potuznik, senior principal engineer at Optum Technology. “With NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software and infrastructure running on our VMware vSphere environment, we’ll be able to power our modern application workloads and efficiently deploy AI at enterprise scale.”Flexible AI Infrastructure for the Hybrid CloudNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides compatibility for a broad set of accelerated CUDA applications, AI frameworks, pre-trained models and software development kits running in the hybrid cloud. Optimizations enable workloads to scale across multiple nodes to support large deep learning training models with full GPU virtualization.To power the applications in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 is now certified for NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, which include high-volume servers from Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro. With this certification comes direct customer support from NVIDIA for vSphere customers that acquire a license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise.NVIDIA has also certified vSphere as the only compute virtualization software to provide hypervisor support for live migration with NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU technology, which allows each A100 GPU to be partitioned into up to seven instances at the hardware level to maximize efficiency for workloads of all sizes.Additionally, select NVIDIA ConnectX adapters are now certified for VMware vSAN over RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access), which offloads CPU communication tasks to boost application performance and improve infrastructure returns on investment.NVIDIA AI Enterprise is available as a perpetual license at $3,595 per CPU socket. Enterprise Business Standard Support for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $899 annually per license. Customers can apply for early access to NVIDIA AI Enterprise as they plan their upgrades to VMware vSphere 7 Update 2.For more information on bringing AI to VMware hybrid clouds, read the NVIDIA blog and the VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 release blog. Free registration is now open for GTC 2021, where NVIDIA and VMware will present on bringing AI to every enterprise."
On average NVDA drops $10 at some point from high to low almost everyday
WOW--WOW--WOW--BAG Holders dream come true !!!
Nvidia price target raised to $665 from $600 at Cowen 07:27 NVDA Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $665 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst believes gaming is a secular growth market the company dominates and which is still in the early innings. He noted demand remains well above supply for both gaming products and datacenter chips.
Remember 2020 February/March meltdown ? Coming soon.
Anyone see this little you-know-what touch $564 to the penny and drop like a rock  off the Empire State Building? Where are all the analysts calling for $700? You had to know you were all R.I.P. when “they” put out a $700 PT and the stock fell $80!
"They’re afraid Nvidia will limit access to ARM’s technology, but why in the world would they do that when they could make so much revenue licensing it. MSFT with a BS complaint like usual."
at day highs NVDA train is back on the tracks...BOOM!!!
"Anyone playing MARGIN in this absolutely crazy market, God help ya!"

Money are moved from tech to energy... oil... simple as that. $Aapl $nvda $msft $amzn
NVDA was $100 higher in July of 2020 $589 almost a full year ago losers

"If for whatever reason the ARM deal does not go thru, Nvidia will offer full CUDA support, all software stacks, full AI capabilities, advanced data center support, and full accelerated computing for ARM to offer all customers who request it. Nvidia would rather own ARM, but the overriding objective is for developers to rely on Nvidia for the most advanced AI supported software, hardware, and support in the world regardless of what CPU they choose. ARM will enter in a strategic relationship with Nvidia not needing approval. ARM knows that they are unable to offer anything near Nvidia's complete solution. Nvidia will be ready with full-implementation in about a year it takes for the projected deal to get approved, or not."
Shorting $480 stock here will cover $299 next week
zzzzZzzzzZzz. Seeeeellllll
"Just a few selections from the legendary loser's comments of the last week.

$498 and $463 need filling 200 day is climbing as the stock is falling R.I.P.
NVDA will gap up 10-15% post earnings. Shorts may drive it up even higher by end of the week.
"Thanks nvda your now in my 100,000 club with 190 shares"
Nvda releases it’s CES report 1/12/21 at 12pm. Has consolidated nicely last couple months and could possibly break out on news. As increasing buying volume might indicate.

if this close green we have a big possibilities to rebound even on next week back to 600 .... that will mean this wasn't a pullback....
Folks you READ it Right Here (so it must be true) I can change on the Market Cap of NVDA. longs will thank me later.
"Invest in tech, invest in tech. How about xom and cvx? Unbelievable. Keep going up with oil."

"I know this is a crazy question, but do any of my fellow Nvidia longs also own INTC? That stock is so cheap right now, but does Intel have a future once Nvidia & Arm merge? Given the favorable outlook for the broader semiconductor industry, you’d think Intel could still be a decent grower over the next 10+ years. Am I nuts? I’m still an Nvidia diehard, don’t worry. Just looking at some other names..."
$400’s!!! Yessssssss!!!!! LOL I doubled down $510 expiring tomorrow up 300% in 10 minutes omg lol
"AI, autonomous cars, Bitcoin, games - all run on NVDA. Even military and SpaceX are using NVDA hardware. Demand in 2021 will be astronomical"
"Stock is priced to move higher significantly.First City Bankers, adding to their position."
Good thing we had those upgrades and earnings beat BWAHAHAHA
"NVDA is R.I.P. I don’t think  “she” ever even comes close to $600 ever again, what a “head fake” at $615, I didn’t panic a bit, shorted more. I made more today than every long in this room has made in their lives."
"Hyundai and Kia confirm they are no longer in talks with Apple regarding Apple Car productionhttps://9to5mac.com/2021/02/07/apple-car-hyundai-kia-production/This means that the partnership between Hyundai/Kia/Nvidia is secure, with Nvidia providing hardware/software for self-driving cars."
NVDA will gap down at least 20 tomorrow am so don’t buy it here going down 50% from 614
Great don't complain if it goes to 450. I'll buy more I like it down much more because it's sure it will go up after it hit 300 some time
Kevin owns this stock.
Imagine if NVDA didn’t blow out earnings and raise guidance?
"Without Nvidia the chinese EV-companies will have uncompetitive products. SAIC, NIO, Li Auto, Xpeng. For that reason alone the Nvidia-ARM deal will go through. China needs Nvidia. China wants to take the worlds EV-market. Nvidia is one of the chinese tickets to do that."
Shorting $512 here! My “lock of the week”! Trade accordingly! Any weak shorts cover $614 when I “doubled down”?
If the ARM's acquisition goes through even those at Google and Apple agree would make Nvidia a potential trillion dollar market cap company. The debate though is that rather than creating further market opportunities for Nvidia they say they would corner the market. I disagree and believe that an agreement could be worked out in the form of a settlement stating that they wouldn't cut Apple and Google off. Will see how this plays out but now even though I posted weeks ago that the market cap would go to a trillion you have analyst's now saying it would increase Nvidia's market cap by at least 18%. That's an understatement to say the least.
My expiring today 550 puts I just bought are up 300% LOL  Man this game is easy
Don't miss the bag holders Conference. Pls bring in Coffee n chair. Rest we can handle.
This set back is only minor. I am a rock!!

NVDA “only” has to go up $115 from here or 23% to break even from 10 trading days ago
No reason for this to be sold.
"the entire market looking like it is setting up for another correction, load up on NVDA when correction exhausts itself, this is going to $800 by this time next year"

These limitations will also free up capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Amon said in a webcast with Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall...."

Here's my 2 cents for NVidia longs!
NVDA $589 August 2020NVDA $550 almost March 2021#Facts
If this keeps up (down) I'm backing the truck up.
Everyone check out Digi.CN. New app that uses A.I to predict Crypto prices. Offers 7 day free traile.
Graphics cards will continue to be in high demand. Great potential in this stock
if we break 460 its going back down to 430. Lot of buyers in at those levels will sell.
I honestly admit I am actually totally 100% addicted to shorting NVDA for I have never lost once
Nvidia is a monolithic chip. HUGE. Intel's Xe is a brand new design using small chiplets.
"shorts their hands are gettin' shaky...a 35 pts swing in one day , phew. That shows how fast it could retrace."
I think  ARK is down 75% this month and about to go under
NVDA is like the movie GROUNDHOG DAY........615 to 483 and everyone Is buying the whole way down
If NVDA trading for $605.65 then the new leader Undervalued AMD should be $300s........?
And here we go with a tech drubbing yet again I’ll be glad when the naysayers have sold their positions so they can invest in ketchup and cereal and docked boats. Just be done already.
Anything lower than $590 is a bargain or screaming BUY...

"This is so short term. Strong fundamentals on chip stocks will power this stock along with others like MU, AMAT and TSMC to new highs before the end of the year. Longs will be just fine while the market tries to capitalize for the very short term on bank and other down stocks. The sky is not falling due to the treasury yield rising either. Very short term."
Same old thing.. Sells for two days after earnings and then skyrockets
"News  Alert  Nvidia changes ticker symbol from NVDA to TURD . BTW, TURD  like their business relationship with NIO? Missed earnings last night stonk down from nearly 70 to 40’s since the TURD  “hook up”. "
hope they resolve FTC probe ...
"ARM deal was announced on sept 13 last year , so almost 6 months ago now. PPS hasn't moved since then (2 blowout quarters were included). We'd be higher without ARM so the market makes a mistake by betting against the deal being done. It's a classic case of the uncertainty over the outcome weighing on a stock. Whatever happens there will be relief."
From $615 to $483 in a week and somehow the perma bulls have been buying every $10
"Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upped his price target on shares of Nvidia Corp. to $700 from $625 Monday, matching the highest price target among analysts surveyed by FactSet."
Buying big if it hits 550. C'mon Jen is nothing short of a genius.
Lawnmowers will need GPU's for AI.

where's salamander Johnson? thought he had a $400 prediction for this week
@Kalpesh....please dance and cheer.
"Time to short. I am ready on pump. Never shorted this n any company from Bay Area, but it's tempting. Still charts r bearish.I want everyone be safe. My value is 336. Go NVDA.."
This year's theme is absolutely no forward PE ratios over 30X. Please plan accordingly. Sell now buy back later for pennies on the dollar.
NO SEC? One might as well gamble on the computers in China keeping track of Bitcoins because the manipulation of prices here by shorts or insiders or computers rules out fair investing either in growth or value. Anyone heard of SEC stepping up for small investors lately?
$20 + drops the new norm. Thank the concommie
Do not cover hot-short-stuff. Wait for Nvidia to turn green. Thanks in advance.
Happy days ahead !!!
Last March down 60%This March only down 20% so far How obvious was this crash 
There will be crying and nashing of teeth in this stock and all this before lunch. Just wait for close today when stock hits $499.
Last earnings the stock was $545. Beat and raised. $510. This time $550 into earnings. $504 after! Save this brilliance!!!
"If it can get above that $519 level, we may be off to the races."
oh god my average price on x3 leverage is at 500$ now I'm down big .... my first entry was at 400$ wich just sold just just keep some profits lol ... now I should open new position at euro x3 leverage to cover the losses pfff ..... this is no sense 
Pls don't forget or miss my invitation for NVDA bag holders conference !!! It's happening on Feb 25. Pls bring your own Coffee and chair.I can only welcome and provide some free thoughts.
Is smart to still buy NVIDIA right now?
YOU BETTER BUY NOW!NVIDIA WILL BE $750+ BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS!
I am shorting NVDA $513. I got another “loin” short feeling. Cover $463 Monday
Just hold on to what you got. Don't let them shake you out. BUY LOW!! SELL HIGH!!
still have my old nvidia t-shirt that is now a hot collector's itemnvidiacrank that $@&t up!!!
You should expect follow through of the after hours sell off. 3% at least.
$700 price target coming soon!
That was a pretty large drop from the highs of the day week year wow nearing 20 dollars be careful if it closes at the lows of the day it is called a reversal day and will be bad
The only guarantee is that the stock will go up or go down when earnings are released
"I was filling out a form for my youngest daughters private school  today for next year, $45,000 a year, and it asked occupation and I put: NVDA short"
GME up 57 bucks.
Only $200 down more and I am buying.
Well lookie here NASDAQ futures dropping like a rock. I guess -1300 in a week wasn’t enough yet
nothing to watch here anymore today will be back Monday hope to see at least a consolidation at 500 .... sell off can't go for ever this is jot how the things are work !!!
"One trillion dollars. Soon. Scream, bash, spam, spread FUD. No one cares.Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
Please tell me $502 was a scam fake price again no way it ever traded $500
In NVDA you own a stock that has no chance of ever going up again in your entire lives
Buy on the dips and you will be rewarded...
Surprised we didn’t get +10 today. Given the market should have been +20. Still looks good for another good move up tomorrow. GL.
How is Kevin doing on that 525 NVDA short position he boasted about on Reddit a couple weeks ago?
The whole world will digest today 's big upgrades and invest more on NVDA....up and uptrend the way it will be....
"Tesla Cathie Wood, where are you, buy high so it goes higher does not work."
"Split, split, split, split... say it with me."
Anyone see that final minute in TURD  the 550 puts from .01 to $2
Maybe some smart Wall Street chump finally figured out that chip shortage means that Nvidia can sell everything they can make and that ASP’s are rising? Nvidia is king! To one trillion dollars and beyond!
Moving along my nicely. $600 is coming soon. Whatever that gap talk of 463 ain’t going to happen. The real gap is from $600 plus. Need to fill that.
I think nvidia is the company of the 21st century. Wish I had bought sooner and it’s so expensive at the levels. Buying a little on every dip tho
$615 to $483 in a week! LOL  The “overhead” pressure on this stock is now gargantuan

"Larry, I like Sal better. Sal is more sensible compared to Larry LOL"
Congratulations NVDA investors for the strong earnings report given by this company yesterday. I can not believe that something like these days can happen when people are rewarding companies that are not fundamentally sound and punish stocks that are fundamentally sound. I remember when some analysts did that because some did not do their research or wants to promote a stock or were late in getting in but those things did not last because people can see what is wrong and they can tell when things go fishy. I think this thing that is happening now is worse because it involves a lot of people who gang up on few stocks with some using margin to get in and selling stocks like NVDA LRCX KLAC APPL AMD ADBE and most tech stocks like semis cloud and others who have been reporting strong earnings for years and have very little debt and some with no debt. These companies are the backbone of our economy and are transforming our ways of life and yet these stocks are being hammered. This thing is not right and I hope good people will see that and reward people that do good work. Stay safe everyone and be kind to others.
Now is the time to buy. Was too cheap before
this is a good company at a decent price for true long-term investors
MSFT backed Graphcore calls on UK regulators too block NVDA’s Arm Acquisition.

Last March of 2020 was a rough month for the stock market. Coronavirus was the impetus that caused a big selloff. Here we are 12 months later and the month of March is looking a little rocky.A good opportunity to buy more shares of NVDA if it drops into the mid-$400 range over the next few days.
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE! PUTTING IN MY TIME IN PARADISE FOR TAX PURPOSES. OTHERWISE CALIFORNIA WILL TRY AND PICK MY POCKETS!WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME TO BE A NVIDIA SHAREHOLDER! BUY AND HOLD LONGTERM!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
"OK, WHAT PRICE WILL NVIDIA BE BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS CALL? I SAY $750+!!!"
Will add more shares to this winner. The CEO is such a good one. He is the reason I will add to my already 'healthy' position. This is easily a $800 stock this year and will build on that once reached.
U bought the top

"Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $610 at Susquehanna 07:02 NVDA Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $625 from $610 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst met with management who communicated the demand backdrop is very, very healthy. He believes any supply shortage is because demand is so strong not the impact of industrywide shortages. Rolland is encouraged by the demand but believes industrywide shortages could limit the most optimistic of bull scenarios."
Where would NVDA be if the NASDAQ weren’t up 100??? Asking for a dear friend
"well this stock is probably worth around $250 given it's high growth rate, but $600, $500...????"

Does anyone in here know a thing about trading? 615 to 460 is around 160 drop retrace 50% is 540 exactly NVDA 50 day moving average; how are you allowed to breathe the same air as me?
Kevin is certainly going to be even more bearish once nvidia hits $1000+
Last year NVDA fell 50% which will take it to around $300 this March
This rotation into the failing stocks of 2020 is ridiculous. Just because vaccines are going to allow people back in restaurants and travel doesn't mean everyone will be doing it. There's still those who will work remotely or were negatively affected by the pandemic and lost their savings. It doesn't make sense that people would sell the great innovative companies whose technology will stay relevant for years to come.
If red at the open I will add more!!!!
As we say here on team green.. SMASH SMASH SMASH .. those freacking shorts!
Remember NVDA fall 60% last February/March

NVIDA need to split like Apple & Tesla.
I think NVDA falls $100 today by the close. Save this brilliance
only 612? this #$%$ never moves up :)
"Relax longs - Jensen delivered a great quarter. Some big players may be trying to play games, I think... There is some talk about chips being in short supply and other talk that chips are in a glut (LOL!), but these may not be relevant to Nvidia...My opinions. Best."
A moment of silence for the shorts who just got nuked.

"Where is that other Kevin, guess he is embarrassed about how WRONG he was."
Just think longs if earnings are great the stock could trade +$30 and you will break even from 2 weeks ago LOL 
what did jensen said
"NVDA “down $50”. Told ya all it would be “down $50.” Any of you perma bulls lose any money? FREEDUMB 6000 shares x $50 = You lost  $300,000 omg "
"6 month NVDA-INTC comp are even, 3 month has INTC over NVDA by 30%. Never thought I would have said I wish I was INTC heavy over NVIDIA. Still waiting for my RTX 30anything card too. Did we just quit producing cards now because of cloud and autonomus? My investment is dying on the vine and that cant last."
"Think I’m done with this one too. Anything FANG related, or close to it, has been a a sideways cluster for months now while docked boats and empty theaters/concert venues rocket higher. Nobody said the market has to make sense (because it doesn’t right now), but one this is for sure. This stock is stalled out."

"Great guidance, Gamjng and Data Centers on fire. Hopefully break out their EV sales in China because that’s supposed to be a blowout. And Arm Holdjngs deal going forward and looking good. As good as it gets. Permission to pile in compadres "
How sad is this board when Kevin is actually the smartest dude here?

"Ask the shareholders of FSLY QCOM how they liked their “blowout” earnings. Read all the exact same comments as I am seeing in here, on those message boards"
$10 gap down every single day no matter what like clockwork. Was $589 last July 2020! Was $615 this month. Was $545 two blowout earnings ago. When is anyone in here going to realize NVDA  is going a lot lower?
"exactly 11 months ago, March 16, 2020, NVDA was 194 a share...."
"Do you people realize that the entire market was down last ten days or so and do you realize that we will be up today . Do you also realize that Nvidia is headed to $1,000 a share and today the unemployment claims were 745k vs a budget of 750k . Things are fast improving and we will be back to normal pretty soon. Meanwhile industrial production is up. Target, Wmt, Costco, Home Depot etc etc have a great Growth. So stay invested and buy more"
Hope Corona staying forever. The stock market is in fire because the economy does awesome in lockdowns and cut away civil rights!
"QCOM, AMZN and GOOG earnings coming...NVDA $516 to $530 today and a lot more coming. Stay long and strong."
How’s my 525 short doing? That’s why I post before making my trades
"Sooner or later Nvidia will start to zoom up again. Nothing goes straight up, not even the semi king Nvidia. AMD is taking a breather as well. The 5G stocks Marvell, Qorvo, Skyworks (Jim Cramers 5G top 3) are on fire though."
Ladies germs  boys girls WHAT TIME DEEP WAY DOWN DARK RED? Mine is 4:18:00pm EST
Nasdaq about to go green and... well you know the rest.
Today was a real tough game of WHAT TIME RED  like 3pm EST after being +$15! ROTFLMFAO 
will be trading at 575+ after 5pm est today
Only 65 points off Kevin's gap he guaranteed would get filled last week.
"Making the easy call: NVDA will blow out earnings and warn for Q1 & full year 2021, and stock will fall under $500. Just my educated guess. Trade accordingly."
NVDA was $589 in July NVDA was $545 TWO earnings agoNVDA was $615 2 weeks ago Invest in a CD it’s more profitable
I made more money today with HUGE short positions and put options in CRWD PYPL NVDA that I bet any of you have made in your entire lives combined
463 to 519 is $46 so NVDA should fall to around her 200 day MA 490 tomorrow 50% retracement of the move from 463 to 519
"nvda 490p shot up 8,000% in 3.5 days nvda 490c shot up 2,500% in 3.5 hrs"
Darth Dummy what happened to that $500 close?
Are we $600 yet :)?
"I'm thinking the May ER will be fantastic; but unfortunately it will be at the same time as the average American will be contending with having their wallet siphoned off by +4 dollar gas putting a drag on the recovery. I still recall 40 years searching under the sofa cushions for 50 cents change to gas the motorcycle for work, and worry about the return later that day. NVDA nice report a few weeks ago was timed a few weeks late; hopefully events don't line up against it again in May."
Scale in to Buy the best of breed starting at these level when they blowout earnings and its an overall market pull back. Good Luck
heading back up and will double by year end folks
"I sayeth NVIDIA is going to $1,000 soon.World wide shortage of Chips/Semi Conductors according to Chinese Sources . They sayeth ""severe shortage""."
NVDA $460 tomorrow night is 100% guaranteed get out now. You all wanted the most clueless human who ever lived as President. Good luck.

"Jensen Huang is yet another example of why when the CEO is the founder of the company the company thrives the vast majority of the time. Throughout history it has been proven this is the case most of the time: Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, etc. Bottom line, Huang is brilliant. NVDA has 63 percent gross margins and an enormous free cash flow of $4 billion. This company is in a holding pattern for now along with AMD but eventually it will awaken from its slumber and roar higher."
Most powerful stock on the market
Do not buy. Below 400 in two days
Nvidia price target raised to $700 from $672 at Truist
"i figure previous conf call, nvda said data center would be down 7% qtr 4. it was actually up.... and i figure nvda's revenue forecast for this current qtr is 17.5% higher than analysts had expected, which means nvda will beat next qtr revenue by 20% (they always beat higher than they forecast). .... Colette bored me on the call last night. I thought the call was boring. Maybe it was just me. And the quality of the call for me was poor. I'm holding my nvda..."
"I think  smart traders like me who read the NVDA earnings realized when they are saying they are selling every chip they make yet inventories rose, they are lying and why the stock fell $150 in 3 days"
Fantastic Day! Get used to it. 2021 is the tear of the Semi’s. And NVDA be DA KIng. $600 after earnings $1000 by end of year.

Hah! Hah!Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
When is earnings report for Nvidia.
march passed 600 today now u see the real nvda bulls!! been in since 60 know the game
Looking at the Moron gauge for this board we are near the bottom! Besides that Shorting trade becoming pretty crowded!
I'll buy 50 @300. Then all the way up to 1000! Thank me later 
"After reading all the bullish sentiment, I'm bearish now. Sometimes you just gotta use your noggin."
See how pointless upgrades and good ER’s are? These are different markets these days. The name of the game is manipulation and short selling.
42 TFlops coming.. Enough said.
bought at 533 that was my last available cash to invest ..... hope it will recover like in in September drop
I think NVDA hits $299 next week. Then I cover and buy. I swear
if this continue like this will end up at 440$ today
Waiting for the German Confucius to enlighten us with his wisdom.
Can’t believe I got another 1000 short @ 537 that’s a forever high for NVDA
Nice close
think this was priced in since it went up 150 in the last several months????
Part of me wants to buy but part of me knows AMD beat and kept falling...so I guess I will just watch for now.
This is a great company. Will be a buy at $200-250 price point
a good buy for medium term.
Lol this chart reminds me of a fast forward version of $NVDA in 2017
care-facility chronics with the emotional development of 10 year olds
Be honest: Anyone still in from $615? Don’t be shy  raise those hands and hold them high be proud be strong 
I bet it falls over $50 today. Anyone want to bet me? Downward gap 580 519 upward gap 463 498 GAPS GALORE
"When NVDA/ARM deal gets rejected + AMD comes out with better technology + a chip slowdown, NVDA will be $298"
NVDA has basically gone from $300 to $460 and falling since the biggest chip boom  in world  history (I don’t count the fake month Covid $180 drop). Not a good stock.
"So, all the technical 'folks' say this needs to get to $589.50 for a break out leading to much higher prices."
"So you are too scared to buy Nvidia? Huh? Already too expensive you say? You are weak and you are wrong. Snap out of it! No guts, no glory. When the ARM-deal clears (and it will) Nvidia will be trading at $1,000. Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
"NASDAQ, S&P 500 WENT RED. NVIDIA STILL GREEN! EXCELLENT! NEXT WEEK WE RALLY TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!"
any amount of green today is impressive
Nvidia is only a pray for arm stockGoing no were If arm fails and that is 16 months from now you don’t want to be around. This is worst than owning Tesla
"Stock trading bot algo 101 - Treasury Yields go low - sell, yields go high - sell, yields go nowhere - sell - LOL"

But it took 5 min - super strong bull power
"@Bob, you shorted at $593.65?"
NVDA is going under $300 in March VIPUL you like $519 still?
"When NFLX was twice the size of Disney I remember reading that one day, I bought Disney stock around $100 & shorted NFLX around $600. Well now DIS is twice as big as NFLX. I saw/read the same thing about INTC and NVDA, NVDA was like $600 and INTC was like $40, so I loaded up on INTC and shorted NVDA around $600 7 months ago, now look, almost even INTC is $60+ never goes down ever at all time highs and NVDA hasn’t had an uptick since."
Gap at $504 to be filled after earnings. Ask the bag  holders of AMD INTC & QCOM how the 15% drops felt after earnings never to recover.
"NVIDIA not getting hit as hard as a lot of the big growth stocks. Because it actually has a pretty decent valuation at these levels. 3 quality growth stocks, with good valuations for this rough market:https://youtu.be/SMQcHMZBaU8"
Hows that ER and those bogus upgrades feeling now?
I have to say that 4% loss today hurts in short run...tsla almost lost 9% today and 28% low from it all time high...at this point I have started adding to tsla and nvda....I see green for remaining 4 days
Its the 42 TFLOPS that is taking this stock down. I've been telling you all for a long long time.
"NVDA is the future. Ignore that fact if you like, but if you do you'll be the one explaining to your children why you can't afford to send them to college."
Just took a screen  shot  of NVDA only down 0.67. Won’t ever see it down only that much ever again.
Almost at selling point.
"Better chance of me making love, from behind, to Lynda Carter, Farah Fawcett, Heather Thomas, Heather Locklear, Jaclyn Smith & Pamela Anderson, in their primes, than NVDA ever going green again, ever!"
this board is pretty quiet.....come on we need more noise. more cowbell.
This thing is hot.
$600 is inevitable! So close we long can feel it within arm reach.
Shorting 585 weekly here at $22.65. It’s a must see.
"I like $ATKR, as an electrician for forty years they have all the pipe, fittings, and unistrut I used. Sells at a reasonable PE of 16.76 and seems set for the rotation away from tech. Bought on 12/15/20, up 27% in 2 months"
$600 came earlier than expected. Do we get another $50 rise next week. Earnings 2/24 how high will NVDA go?

Morgan Stanley just said NVDA should report strong results.
ANOTHER GIFT! GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY. ADD SHARES HEREDOLLAR COST AVERAGE INALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN.CHOO CHOO!
NVDA gives up 3 days worth of gains and you people act like its the end of the world. Chill out and enjoy the ride. Once they close the purchase of Arm they will be the only AI company. I have been in NVDA since 19/share. Every stwp of the way people sounded just like today.
"Powell/Yellen clueless, no ammunition left. Friday jobs report, can't wait."
"I only lost around $25 in stock options, I'm so glad I resisted the urge to buy more. It would be great if it went up by $100 but it's somewhat wishful thinking."

Now the stock is really moving....up over 2%....now 2.54%
"Watch TXN, Texas Instruments earnings next week. Very big in the auto market. If they beat and increase estimates, NVDA will fly to 52 week high. Same with LRCX."

New tech will continue to go up no matter what. Nvidia is one of 'm (AD/EV/AI/VR/gaming/mining/data centers/ARM). Diversified but this is still my largest holding. Needham is spot on.

"So Intel is the place to be right now? Huh? What? Forget about that! Intel is still a huge mess - and the new CEO has not even started yet. The turn-around will take years. If it is even do-able. Taiwan Semi said yesterday that’s business is booming. All is great in semi-land. 5G products are booming. Remember to get the 5G top 3; Marvell, Qorvo, Skyworks.Nvidia is still king. Nvidia is doing deals left and right. Automotive wil be huge. We are on our way to one trillion dollars."

How many people sold the weekly 600 calls the other day for $25?
Told you to sell at $590. That's what I did.
Almost 600! That’s awesome! I bought in at 139 as a F it moment and held through all the dips and of course will hold long as hell!
"Growth tech names like $ZM $TSLA $SNAP $PINS $SFIX $TWLO $NVDA $TWTR etc. selling off for a simple reason. Powell saying that when the economy returns to normal so will inflation. This leads to strong fundamentals growth (booming economy) but rising rate environment. Rising rates hit DCF discount rates on growth stocks (all of the aforementioned names have huge multiples). This means the highest multiple stocks start coming back to reality. I've been rolling back into my highest conviction names. As fundamentals show their strength, the market will likely get over the temporary valuation correction and re-rate growth names higher. I'm not going long value tech ($INTC or $FB or $AAPL), I'm going to stick to what works. Long $PINS and $SNAP more specifically."
I see $299 next week at some point where I cover and go long swear
I hope we'll get a red day tomorrow. Dow and Nasdaq need to retest March lows

I'm being a little sarcastic; but I'm starting to think NVDA will increase 100% once the ARM deal is completed; going from 3 to 600.

mistery solved; kylie sold at 555...and the longs are to blame of course. We should have sold as well. Or: how 12 year olds think. Oh well. He'll grow up eventually. Or not.
$620 soon
Nvidia Q4 Earnings- Q4 Adj. EPS $3.10 (est $2.81)- Q4 Revenue $5.00 Bln (est $4.82 Bln)
"If the ARM deal goes through and existing IP licensing agreements remain, but new IP is designed in a collaboration between ARM and Nvidia engineers, who is to say that they don't approach cell phone manufacturers with a cutting edge mobile chip solution? Apple is doing their own thing, but what if Samsung decided to move from Qualcomm to Nvidia? I wonder why Qualcomm is trying to kill the deal? "
"Be honest, could you all believe you didn’t sell $615 stock or even $605 stock earlier today? My GOD! NO stock goes from $589 to $573 in 6 months into earnings if things are good!"
"Hint to longs: Want to know my secret? If Cathie Wood of ARK is buying, I am shorting. I literally never lose"
NVDA falls below $500 I make half a million on my weekly NVDA put options so no one buy
No one here can handle the truth: NVDA $25 just five years ago.
https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqOQgKIjNDQklTSURvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoTUtFUWpKMEpfN2tZQU1FU2E1eGpFZVVORUpLQUFQAQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen
Who is staying long and strong going into earnings ? No position but hope NVDA beats so my LRCX and AVGO rocks.
"Better chance of hitting Powerball 100 weeks in a row than NVDA ever, yep you heard right, ever trading higher again"
"OK, I will bite. Just raised my Nvidia shares by 16,67% and bought more at $522,50! What a glorious day!Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
$615 to $550 right before earnings is R.I.P. I actually feel bad for all longs. All RobinHood stocks will be wiped out and NVDA is the leader
"cheapest (valuation) grow stock on the planet, compare this to SHOP or TSLA eg, just think where this will be in 3 months or later this year, added more at 476"
If someone gave me a million dollars cash to cover my short positions and sell my put options positions I would have to honestly say no
This will spike 15 to 25% higher in one day once the UK unleashes its statement that it has no problems with the ARM takeover. If you're short you need to know. Anyways I'm putting my cash to work on days like these.
@LarryTheLegend didn't you predict NVDA $570 today?
Now in a low volume 'handle' setup into earnings next week. I consider that a bullish omen.
Down $40I see down $100 today NVDA is still WAY WAY overpriced at $540
What is a good entry point?
NASDAQ down 100/NVDA -$10NASDAQ up 400/NVDA +$5Any questions?
"Massive short cover happening. Not even volatile, just going straight up"
"Benjo said today: ""the sell off continues"". Just imagine what will happen to pps when the buying starts."
They gave positive forecast for next quarter. Go on value of company n hold...670 within 2 week with upgrades n short squeeze
KEVIN's OBITUARY KEVIN IS DEAD!MAY HE REST IN PEACEHIS NVIDIA STOCK DERANGEMENT SYNDROME SUFFERING IS OVER.LOL!
You can be long and short in a stock and make money doing both. Some rewards are instant and some are down the road. The whole trader vs investor mentality.
VIPUL is a good trader. Sold $555 and hasn’t had an uptick since. You all laughed at him. I applauded him. Only fell $18 intraday and the market is still up!
Where is the bearish  Kevin? He’s always right. I came in here about to buy last August @ $589 but didn’t because he said gap @ $504. He saved me millions. Thank you “bad” Kevin.
All i see is juicy discount on sexy company which is gonna soar all year
Oracle and CSCO upgraded to overweight by two prominent Analysts on IT Enterprise spending due to recovery. NVDA data center sales ?
This was big flush. NVDA is due for a BOUNCE...and a leg up form its 200dma area . Growth funds will be Buying at these levels. Good Luck.
"I love Nvidia, and what a run but man has it stagnated over the past month. Here's hoping for a big pop!GLTA "
"NVDA past two days 20mil shares traded and stock moved uptrend, I think this continues, afterhours stock is down on half mil shares traded, most of shares volume afterhours is buying action."
Is the Reddit crowd onto Nvidia? Looks like it. Either that or Needhams Rajvinder Gill has raised his price target on the stock.
Let's do $530 close today. $555 next week.
Everyone keeps saying NVDA is down on no news! WRONG! AMD is announcing their “Nvidia killer” gaming chips tomorrow
NASDAQ futures crashing NVDA will open $504 at the highest should see $485 or so
"Rosenblatt sees almost 25% upside this year (said it today). Time is on our side, longs. Earnings season kicks off."
buy NVDA on earnings dip. NVDA still in business.
cover cover cover. you are losing profits
Stonks like INTC CVX BA DKNG PENN GME making new highs everyday and you are stuck in NVDA for a year 0%
I miss those trading days of buying under $520 and selling over $530. Let's go.
RED LOL
That was not a good finish
"beat and drop...wall street's trick to rob main street. look at high runners...GMD, AMC...Bernie should have been awarded Nobel prize for economics..Ponzi scheme is on wallstreet's new textbook.. nvda's earning was solid. I added 100 shares today. just a hiccup..no panics. i think we will see a bounce back very soon maybe tomorrow.."
Lunch time at the Home and ice cream for desert
61% revenue growth year over year. Incredible...
Earnings coming up....expectations of $2.80 a share on $4.82 billion revenue.
This stock is really a drag right now. Where are the buyers?
Well it was nice to know what 600 felt like.

I expect (NVDA) to surge to new highs after it report its upcoming earnings!!$650 to $700+ 
something wrong with this once hot stock--NVDA!==sell when in doubt!

"Automotive and Crypto business will help grow NVDA business ""even"" further this year, I think. Thanks Jensen."
"Ladies & Gentlemen boys & germs what time red? LOL  $615 to $504 just like I told you would happen 10,000x"
I TOLD YOU TO BUY TODAY. I GOT 500@$539.50. ALWAYS DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON MARKET DROPS. WATCH AND LEARN. CHA CHING!
LRCX is just a much much much better company with minimal competition and unlimited potential
"yes, yes, yes!"
"Well, anyone buy the fake breakout last week at $615? Like I said when it fell $80 to $535, no stock falls $80 right before earnings if they are going to be good "
Wait until the Federal Reserve decides that long term rates are rising too fast and decides to accelerate their bond purchases to keep rates low. All the r-tards selling because of the media coverage that the sky is falling will be too late to jump back in. Shorts will get smoked.
Take life savings & short NVDA $598 here through earnings and thank me later
NASDAQ SELL OFF MARKET ROTATIONBUY NOW. BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN TECHNOLOGY WITH NVIDIA AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST.
Gap 494Also WHAT TIME RED? I pick 9:30  am EST
But but but its supposed to be $1600!!!! 
Anyone long from 615: Advice? Short 487 here with twice as many shares you were long from 615 to 487
"Since August every month the 600 calls, which have all been expensively bloated, have all expired used toilet paper  after White Castle "
why is kevin still talking
My INTC down a penny today near all time highs
A few million years ago there was a company called 3dfx interactive. They ruled everything in 3D visuals. Nvidia took them out.Recently Nvidia wanted to buy a company called Mellanox. Everyone and their mother said the deal would never ever ever pass regulatory approval. Mellanox is Nvidia Networking now.Never ever ever EVER bet against Nvidia. Surely the deal will pass..!!!
"better cover now ,it's going up"
Closed lows of the day down $50 on 300% volume NVDA will never trade $500 again after tomorrow Short away
What's going on?
Currently ranked 4 (sell) on ZachAnother article says Nvda is not a buy right nowGet out now and try to get back in after a big drop of earning folks
No one  I repeat no one in the world  is holding any stocks into a weekend ever
I honestly can say with confidence that I don’t think  NVDA will ever trade higher ever again
Let’s play the newest game sweeping  the nation  called IMAGINE IF. Let’s imagine where NVDA would be if the NASDAQ weren’t up 5000 points since it hit $589 last August 2020
No stock falls $35 right before earnings if they are going to be good! Supply constraints again like last earnings! BTW $545 last blowout earnings $575 tomorrow am nice stock stock collapses after every earnings
I must say @Darth Trader really did predict this. he must be a god
Observation: profits will have doubled this may (12 months) and we're up less than 30% since then. I doubt this will fall much further. On the contrary. Screaming buy.
Decimated! All techs just horrendous. Techs definitely affecting my overall performance today.
$30 off the daily lows which means it will drop below that after earnings Sorry longs it’s reality Fell 615 to 535 right before earnings No way it’s going higher than 580
"hey all, I check in on this forum to check for news and updates on nvda price action and just want to thank everyone for contributing. I've been an nvda long for a while and will keep holding. for those of you who don't know I just found that u can mute people so for those of you that find that #$%$ that goes by the name legend annoying, you can mute him and you don't have to tolerate his #$%$ts."
Buy NVDA before too late & be regret loosing a chance to gain!! you will miss the boat when it take off big!! the

Sub 500 before 10am is a lock  feel it in my loins 515 now let’s see
Bye  200 day moving average going to $299 in March
NVDA has to rise +$60 after earnings to break even from yesterday LOLLLLL
I am more confident if 463 from 540 then I was 504 at 614. And we all know how many times I called that. Sell inner loin 513 short 463 then 299
Futures going slowly into green (dow is already there). Looks like we're gonna have a normal trading day.
don't sell
WHAT TIME  $504? 9:30  am EST
The king of technology. Hail to the king
Making the call: NVDA will be down $50 today. Save this brilliance.
"1,000% gain on nvda 3/10 500c from 2 to 20 in a day and a halfboom"
BUY WITH BOTH HANDS THIS IS IN EVERYTHING. COMPUTERS EV CARS TELEVISIONS I PADS ANYTHING ELECTRIC. NVIDIA MOST LIKELY IN. Stay long they cannot even keep up with demand. Buy this and forget about it going to 750
NVDA $584 and crashing NVDA $589+ last AugustAny questions?
I sure would like to know what caused NVDA to jump 6% all of the sudden. It's not like this company doesnt have a positive rankings. We were getting choked @ $520 for over 6 months and now it's gonna move? What gives or is it astrological?
"All I require for my thesis to remain intact is for the 600Calls to continue to expire worthless. Today would make such action “more likely”Whatever the actual price is, it’s < 600."
NVDA has to have minimum +$40 day after earnings for longs to break even from 2 days ago
"600+ in after hours tomorrow on fantastic results, they still can't keep up with all the demand"
GME $350 up $100I don’t hear  anyone congratulating me for long GME $39 and short NVDA $614. Still haven’t covered one share of NVDA btw
"So Big Daddy, how many millions did you short at the close?"
"Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google etc.. Say NO ARM for Nvidia. The whole deal was to give Softbank $2B. Everyone knows the ARM deal won't go through. Too much at stake for many companies and countries."
Nvidia stock price target raised to $660 from $605 at J.P. MorganMentioned:NVDA
"NASDAQ kicking it into high gear, NVDA soon to follow! Shorts the door really closing fast now!!!"
$504 is coming there is a gap there sorry to say been telling you 1000x bag holders galore I feel bad for you novices
NVIDIA is down 5.46% to 484.25
lol look on pre market driving as hell again
where you at Legend????
"Chips shortage ? Buy the suppliers, AMAT, LRCX, ASML....they will benefit the most. I am long LRCX since 1990 and my quarterly dividends are more than my original investment. If ASML drops $20-30, I will buy and put is away."
it is a green day. we are going to recoup what we gave yesterday
Graphcore competition comeing to a town near you Huang! Your little pixel pushers won't stand against real AI hardware that was designed with AI in mind
NVDA could very easily fall $50 again today with some luck
"For all of you that want the ARM deal to go through, at the earliest it won't be until 2022. If you have stock at that time good luck because NVDA will be paying 38 billion in stock for the deal. Your valued stock will be so diluted, it will be significantly lower. After the accountants rebalance the books, NVDA will be force to be wrecken with. The ARM deal makes NVDA a monopoly on 1500 licenses and could charge whatever they want for services on chips. Just saying!"
There it is: 24 weeks straight the 600 call options expired used toilet  paper  with the stock in the 500’s the entire time. Almost  impossible yet #FACT
From 2.5% UP to 2.5% DOWN....Hmmmmm
"Hey shorts, take a gander at the scoreboard. You coulda, shoulda, woulda covered at $530. So tell us again, who are the greedy ones here today?"
"Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $575 at Piper Sandler Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $625 from $575 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. Nvidia reported strong January quarter results and April quarter guidance, Kumar tells investors in a research note. As we move from the January quarter to the April quarter, much of the sequential growth will likely be driven by gaming, with a moderate contribution from data center and other segment, says the analyst. ""Despite the cryptocurrency distraction, we believe the company is set up well for future growth in both gaming and data center,"" concludes Kumar"
Omg  just fell $4 in literally less than one second lol I have never seen that ever before in 30+ years of trading
"Can you believe QUALCOMM protesting NVidia purchase of ARM. It is ok if I do it, just don't want you to."
I THINK WE GOT A NVIDIA TRAIN!!!
red in a row
HOW ABOUT A NVIDIA ROCKET? SWEET BREAK OUT!IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. STOCKS BASE. STOCKS GET DRAGGED DOWN BY MARKET FORCES (CHINESE VIRUS) ALWAYS BUY GOOD COMPANIES ON PULLBACKS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND (REGULARLY) ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN. VERY SIMPLE AND EASY STRATEGY TO GET RICH. JUST TAKE A PORTION OF YOUR INCOME EVERY MONTH AND BUY SHARES.
$557+ to $530 and going A LOT lower! NVDA R.I.P.! VIPUL I would lower your buy from $519 to $460.
NVDA + $550 = Superman + Kryptonite I will be lowering the price now weekly since $564 will never ever ever be seen again
"NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. We’ve all been here 3x before, and guess where she went? Down the drain"
in a few months $520 will be dirty cheap
Not all Chip Shortages are the same.Shortage of passive component's will quickly lead to a glut of memory when end use devices can't be built. Witness $NVDA NIVIDA down $36 a share today.

"There is a v curve coming... 545 was a frequent bounce point, it won’t go there. Excellent numbers and upward guidance and consistency in beating the street = higher price. I’ll add to my holdings near the open."
LoL! bashers turn into spamming bots on rally days... lOl!
"https://fortune.com/2021/02/04/nvidia-arm-takeover-antitrust-regulators/""The regulatory process is proceeding as we had planned,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said Thursday. ""Every European Commission merger filing has a pre-notification period, which can last several months for a major transaction. We are confident that we will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.""We fully understand that the relevant governments and regulators will review this transaction in detail, as they should, given the significance of the deal,"" Nvidia said."
Going to fill the gap at $504 by Friday.......
200 day moving average is now 490. Last March after fell under it went down 60%. That takes us to $250
These opening bell dives getting old yet?
Intel blew out their Data Centers growth numbers. That’s NVDA’s sweet spot and bodes well and confirms a coming massive ER

"this is easy a $800B company, early next year will be around $600B"
NVDA will fall between $20-$40 tomorrow. Save this post and please keep your hands on the wheel & trade accordingly
Earnlngs coming out on the 24th. Looks like a lot of FOMO amongst the big investors. Many big blocks trading on the ask side of the mkt.

China produces 25% of all cars sold worldwide and there are more drivers than gamers. I think we're underestimating the growth of nvidia in this segment. Check new contracts.
NVDA will close down under $450 this week! Short $545 and buy outs now
"I mention this before, the street is desperate to dump overhyped-overpriced NVDA at $480.51 or any price they can get......Last week the street was desperate to dumped on you retail investors $620, $610, $580, $550, $510, $500, $490"
Microsoft blows away Q2 expectations on cloud and personal computing strength....and up big AH....Patience longs...
$700 by ER ? Comments ? It has been flat for 6 months.
"As much volatility as today this winner is only slightly ahead of 10 day ave. volume. This illustrates that there were fewer sellers today when compared to high volatile ones. This should be a core holding in one's portfolio along with AMZN, MSFT, AVGO, and many other HIGH QUALITY tech stocks."
"From Motley Fool: In addition to strong gaming-related sales, higher sales of laptops and other mobile devices during the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to a chip shortage. This imbalance between soaring demand and limited supply is likely to help AMD and NVIDIA fetch relatively high prices for their chips, boosting their profit margins in the process. Today's gains, in turn, might be just the beginning of a larger rally in these semiconductor leaders' share prices."
Me thinks we’re looking at a Blowout Quarter and Stock Split. Jensen Huang is a real visionary and Maestro and thinks 4 moves ahead of anyone. Deservedly to be mentioned in the same breath as the Elite CEO’s. IMHO 
"Sold some in the AH and now have bought them back getting a $35 spread. Wait for the analysts. Should see many revisions upwards and with the government weighing in on technology importance, $615 high will be taken out soon. GL"
Guess someone decided that P/E matters now
I had to leave early this morning with the SNAZZY NAZZY up 200. Did it close up over 300? ROTFLMFAO 
buy today it's going up tomorrow
Just extended my stay by 3 weeks at the Breaker’s in Palm Beach  @ $2500 a night. 
NVDA will be down $50 tomorrow on the AMD news. Please trade accordingly
Entire NASDAQ reversal pretty impressive! This whole thing over the 10 year is crazy!
"Waiting for tomorrow to take a deep ocean dive. Loading up @ 450, 400, 300"
"Tomorrow, it's heading for 580. I see 540 before earnings."
"Cathie Wood is begging for mercy. look at NVDA, TSLA, PLTR....she is done."
Nice rebound.
If NVDA doesn’t hold her 200 @ $490 it will go to $299 next week
This is like a great price to buy at.
"Bull case: Nvidia has partnered with over 370 Tier 1 Automotive suppliers, researchers and automakers including Mercedes-Benz, Nio, Toyota, Hyundai, VW, Volvo and Audi. They have acquired Mellanox and developed the DGX A100 for datacenter that has reduced the costs for major cloud companies by 1/10th while running at 1/20th the power with partners including Microsoft, VMware and Redhat. The Mellanox deal has also allowed Nvidia to offer Cyber Security Solutions and expand their datacenter marketshare. Nvidia has announced over 70 gaming laptops that will use their RTX GPU's in 2021 alone with their RTX 3090 being the most powerful consumer GPU on the planet (the A100 being the most powerful DPU on the planet). Nvidia is attempting to close the deal with ARM that will effectively allow them to ditch AMD and produce their own CPU's for self driving, datacenter, compute and mobile. The deal would bring in some of the most intelligent semiconductor architecture designers on the planet that helped Apple become what it is today back in the Acorn Computers days. Nvidia GPUs are included in 8 of the 10 fastest industrial supercomputers in the world, which speaks to the abilities of Nvidia engineers if the ARM deal falls through. Nvidia is in the Nintendo Switch that sold over 3.3 million units worldwide in the first 11 weeks. Demand due to Covid and the emergence of AI has created the best environment for GPUs on record with the demand to continue for the foreseeable future with supply struggling to keep pace.Bear case: No one in the future is going to drive, use the internet or game because everyone will become Amish. AI doesn't exist and won't transform the way we live. And I wasn't smart enough to buy years ago, so now I go around yahoo message boards to take out my anger on those who were smart enough to buy. Any questions?"
"I hope this thing slivers here just under 500 for a couple hours, resetting the intraday RSI, then breaks out over 500 and has an hour long short squeeze into the close."
$600 and counting!
GREAT DAY TO BUY THE DIP!WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!CONGRATULATIONS!KEEP DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN!
You all own a stock down $100 in a week on incredible spectacular earnings. Think  about that for a second
"nvda a $1000 stock, gaming, crypto, cloud, on prem data centers, EV industry, 5G wieless...."
NVDA $615 to $483 without one uptick! Do you realize the millions you could have made with put options this week? My $540 puts I bought for pennies are $60+
look on tesla lol from 900 to 600
"TA is useless with a stock like this...we had several ""buy points"" at 550's , multiple times during several weeks/months ago ago and then it fell to 510's various times. I guess it works the other way too."
Not one chip company has traded higher after earnings! 0-100!

"Why do IBD article have questions and NOT answers ?? IBD article headline always start with question "" Is Nvidia Stock A Buy After Steep Decline, Tech Sell-Off?"" I thought they are suppose to tell or suggest. Are they thinking RETAIL investors are the experts?"
"Najarian on CNBC sez -On CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" the investment committee gave their final trades.Market Rebellion Co-Founder Jon Najarian likes NVIDIA Corporation"
You all like this stonk NVDA @ $470? So over priced. Not even close to a bottom. I will let you all know when to cover & go long.
"Hey  longs, I mean “wrongs”, the market could go to 100.000 and NVDA still wouldn’t hit $589 again"
I am bullish
Gotta love buying these blue chips. Beginning of the year I bought aapl. That went in the crapper. Then I thought NVDA will be a safe play and now this. Wow!!!!
"Li Bin is smart, he knows that NIO doesn't need to be the master of everything and can utilise partnerships with amazing companies like $NVDA and $SNP. The earnings call tonight should be interesting."
"beating by this much, we should see a 10% pop tomorrow, just like what GOOG did."
WE NEED A NVIDIA ROCKET!
615 to 483 in a week and longs are proverbial “creaming in their pants” because NVDA is up $1
10:27am ET was the correct answer to WHAT TIME BLOOD  RED. Congratulations  to all who played this Monday morning. Imagine if NASDAQ weren’t up 200
what happened to after hour trading?
So who bought at $615?
$504 or bust! Just wait until earnings will make Tesla look like it’s going up
smart $$$ accumulating here
"Not to worry...as usual in past many e/r quarters, short sellers tried to get out of the wood as they know NVDA will be for sure UP HUGE tomorrow morning as it TOP beats estimate today on both REVENUE and EPS with GREAT GUIDANCE for fiscal 2022 quarters....No wonder when it SHOULD BE up at least 10% or higher tomorrow at opening market where millions of traders get in ...."
"Had to mute Kevin, he's what we used to call in the 60s, a Head Jammer!"
"From Tom's Hardware: Jensen Huang's answer came during a Q&A with the press to cover the company's GTC announcements. Still, as expected, the topic of the ongoing shortages of GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 models bubbled up during the session. In response to a question about the shortages, Huang countered that the company hadn't experienced a shortage of supply, but rather an abundance of demand:""The 3080 and 3090 have a demand issue, not a supply issue,"" said Huang. ""The demand issue is that it is much much greater than we expected — and we expected really a lot.""""Retailers will tell you they haven't seen a phenomenon like this in over a decade of computing. It hearkens back to the old days of Windows 95 and Pentium when people were just out of their minds to buy this stuff. So this is a phenomenon like we've not seen in a long time, and we just weren't prepared for it.""""Even if we knew about all the demand, I don't think it's possible to have ramped that fast. We're ramping really, really hard. Yields are great, the product's shipping fantastically, it's just getting sold out instantly,"" said Huang. ""I appreciate it very much, I just don't think there's a real problem to solve. It's a phenomenon to observe. It's just a phenomenon."""
"nvda 3/5 485c +1,800%friday is payday"
Today very low volume. That is a bullish setup.
That wasn't good.
The weekly 550 calls down 60% today LOL  when will you rookies ever learn?
Possibly the largest growth stock in the next decade with the most solid track record in tech and youre shorting when its low
"Don't worry Kevin, that 504 gap will be filled!!!"
"Never would have believed this stock would fall to bear territory (over 20%) from its high just a few weeks ago AND after that fantastic earnings report. Everyone just wants those energy stocks. It's crazy. But it's the market. Not selling this stock nor other great ones like AMZN and AVGO. All clobbered, however. Even some 'non techs'. Not on margin and have no debts so I will just take it on the 'cheek' for now. Things will get rational again. Congrats to those playing energy. Have a winning hand for now."
5B vs expec 4.81. top to bottom beat.

"Down $100 in 2 weeks. Yep, everyone saw that coming. lol Haven’t sold a share and wish I had more cash to add here."
Anyone make 500% on the weekly 520 puts on my “feel it in my loins” posts to short $535 late yesterday?
"Bought 530 puts as a joke just 10k worth for .50 sold 7.50 lol $150,000 cleared lol "
Bye  Bye  NVDA $500 forever. Now we can get to $299 where I promise I will cover & go long. Will be there by tax day
Here's Huang as a young fellow...
$605 high to $573 low so far. That's $32 . We are not done yet. NAZ may be down 500 points today. I warned you about 10 year yield and NAZ last week.
Good day for chip lovers! Nvidia about to break $600 and AMD approaching $100!! Love em both!
NVDA will be down $10+ at one point tomorrow or I never post again
NVDA just fell $10 in literally one second pre market going to 450 today
GREAT DAY TO BUY SOME STOCKS WHEN THE MARKETS ARE DOWN!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN.!

WHAT TIME?
Stop the bleeding already
September Intel announces new design chiplet Xe at 42 TFLOPS. Ever since then Nvidia has stayed flat or has gone down.Not a coincidence. Nvida chip is a HUGE MONOLITH dinasaur no future for it. Intel Xe is the future.
BUY NVIDIA THE STOCK WILL BE $700+ VERY SOON.
"Seriously, does anyone here have some sort of idea of what's causing the run-up?"
"“Autonomy and electrification are the key forces transforming the automotive industry,” said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. “We are delighted to partner with NIO, a leader in the new energy vehicle revolution—leveraging the power of AI to create the software-defined EV fleets of the future.”“The cooperation of NIO and NVIDIA will accelerate the development of autonomous driving on smart vehicles. NIO’s in-house developed autonomous driving algorithms will be running on four industry-leading NVIDIA Orin processors, delivering an unprecedented 1000+ TOPS in production cars,” said William Li, Founder, Chairman and CEO of NIO.$NVDA $NIO"
Got my $499. Done for today. See you tomorrow. Taking dog out to Clearwater beach.
"I honestly believe that if NVDA hadn't announced the ARM deal the stock would be in the $600 to $650 range. It was a reach for the stars that has many investors worried. If the deal goes through NVDA then becomes an $800 stock almost overnight, but I worry what will happen if the deal doesn't go through. On another note I feel like the stock is being manipulated as didn't this ""investigation"" story come out several months ago and is just being replayed to keep the stock down."
3 huge selloffs and all before noon. Yup a really great stock
Anyone here also “feel it in their loins” yesterday @ 535+ when I shorted and bought weekly puts up 1000%
Breakout time.Check 1 year chart. Just in time. 700's by august is not too far fetched imo.
It takes a lot of time to count all of that coin...be patient.
To expensive. Will buy graphcore on day one and hd forever. NVidia has no meat left on the bone.
"Shorts in denial. What else is new. ""oh but we're not short, we're just concerned about you longs""....Okaaaaaay. Don't worry, we're doing very fine. Thank you very much."
rumors of fake interest rate hike today. buy the dip.
@TrapperKeeper12 hahaha lost all your life savings shorting NVDA. say hi to Larry for me
Kevin likes gaps so I'm sure he's expecting NVDA to fill the gap at $520 today.
$615 to $483 and can’t tick up a penny R.I.P. NVDA
"If this thing takes out Friday's low, I see nothing stopping it from going to $400 at least."
unbelievable
"Decent ER, but way too expensive. 6-7% growth Q/Q, plus about the same for next Q, ain't much to talk about. If long, maybe would not sell, but I ain't buying at these levels."
On to $700 after next ER 
Green.
Imagine if NVDA didn’t blow out earnings and up forward guidance huge?
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A NVIDIA ROCKET LAUNCH!TIME FOR LIFTOFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH!
"ARM, the best of British innovation + NVDA, the crown jewel of semiconductors = global domination."
625 tomorrow 
When NASDAQ fell 350 last week NVDA fell $50Weird it’s up 350 and down $5
"Ladies & Germ  infested TARDS, WHAT TIME RED? Since I began ripping NVDA on a daily basis back into August:NVDA $589 to $527SOXX up 30%NASDAQ up 40%Any questions to my strength?"
Boom!!!!!!
"The OPTIONS predicted this. There was no need to eat a book, or guess, or come in every day for 8 months and say the same thing and hope. I traded this up and down and told you buy long and sell short. 8 weeks ago, I ran the Options through the GJJ supercomputer and it said: All 600 calls will expire worthless, FOREVER. that of course means no Friday close will ever be above 600. You can manipulate all week, but by Friday, it’s going under 600. That prediction has held for every options expiry for 8 weeks and will continue to hold: Forever. I will advise if the prognosis of the GJJ supercomputer changes."
"Nasdaq will turn Green soon,"
I have been in and out of nvda for a few years now. Is my recollection correct that the stock price rises into earnings and then drops or sideways after?..... obviously in a perfect world it will be a nice steady climb
10% market correction is imminent. Trade with caution !
it's a no-brainer buying nvda sub 500 for true long-term investors
Wheres Kevin?!?! hahahaha
"Love how every long down $150 in 4 days somehow has more non stop funds to keep buying every $10 down $150! Liars! Doesn’t work that way. Margin dries up the more you lose and you get margin called! Someone like me, I am short with every penny to my name so my margin has quadrupled in a month so I just keep shorting with freed up cash"
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!NVIDIA LAUNCH!NEXT STOP $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!GET IN NOW!NVIDIA WILL ROCKET TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS
of course i would by puts during a rally.
coddled chronics with the emotional development of 10 year olds
All time high
"Love all the initial headlines on earnings, ""NVDA explodes higher after Blow out Earnings"" , LOL"
If you longs want to invest in this stock you should start buying at $490/share and add a few shares after each $30 decline from there. Growth stocks are out of favor now. The money is piling into #$%$ with #$%$ poor balance sheets and slow growth.
let's go baby let's go
I see $532 soon  gap then $504 gap. Then RIP  for the remainder of 2021 back around $298 where I honestly will cover and go long with real TIGHT stop  losses obviously
"BA grounds all 777’s, engine bursts into flames and their up $10 BWAHAHAHA"
It's all just to screw the people trading options. Will drop down to $550 and then go up to $600 tomorrow. Just watch.
just a 35 forward p/e ratio... Not expensive for the smartest company in the world IMO. Nvidia will be one of the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now.
Tame CPI...NVDA train keeps moving today...sweet
We simply cannot catch a break in this market.
You all like the 550 560 570 580 590 600 all HUGE call options bought into earnings ALL near $0 by Friday. See how this game works? BTW NO put options bought.
Will be under $400 by Friday
look at GME LOLOLOL lets say thank you to NVDA!
I see now why they claim nvidia stumbled today. Crypto will not be a large part of the business
NVDA below the 200 day moving average finally. Going to $299 this month
"Record er but Down? Priced for perfection. All is priced in , it went up 300$ on covid allone. The future is digitalisation bit Nvidias run is over. They can't grow into this high price"
Top and bottom lines beat analysts expectations as did projections for the next quarter. Keep buying this dip!
My supercomputer sees 5% in the red today
10 year going back down to 1.50 by next Tuesday. NVDA to $550.
Should exceed above $615 by tomorrow to new RECORD HIGH....as good E/R today....
KEVIN REALLY SOUNDS DESPERATE how negative can he get.
Never bet against Cathy Wood! Hehe 
"funny how the shorts were bashing NVDA on Friday, now they are all hiding. glad to see they are gone!"
"thoughts on ARM acquisition? not liklihood or even how rich we'd get if it happens... im interested to hear if people think it would be good for the broader processor market. are we trading of efficiencies for innovation? will nvidia be a good overlord and continue to license? is it worth the risk? what's gained (not in share price, which would pass all Jupiter's moons)?"
Where's the kid Kevin? who doesn't have enough for 1 share NVIDIA
"I see the bulls are out grazing today. Dang, this bites."
Zzzzzeeeeeelllllll seeeellllll
Dayum. What happend here?
$466.72 next support then on $458.19
"For everyone waiting for a stock market crash, you realize we had one last year right?"
The ex div date is the 9th.
"As long as I keep hearing EVERYONE saying earnings will be INCREDIBLE AMAZING SPECTACULAR like FSLY & QCOM, and 100 price target increases, YET the stock hasn’t moved a penny in 6 months, I know this will be $504!!!!!!!!"
Dow up 600 on Friday and NVDA after falling $150 is up $4 LOL 
Anyone short 519 when I begged you to???
WHO ARE THE LUCKY INVESTORS BESIDES ME THAT BOUGHT NVIDIA TODAY? CONGRATULATIONS!!! FIRE SALE PRICES!I ADDED ANOTHER 500. I WILL CONTINUE MY DOLLAR COST AVERAGE PLAN AND BUY ANOTHER 500 IF THE NASDAQ SELL OFF CONTINUES.
I think  we hit $504 tomorrow. Decent quarter but disappointing to say the least! Remember $600 in after hours? LOL! Reminds me of FSLY @ $102 right to $59
Just fell $5 in one second new freshly baked lows of the day
Disappointed with action today. Wanted to see up over 30. Will have to wait till tomorrow. And so it goes!
Man those 600 calls going for $25 last week LOL  again that’s 27 consecutive weeks the 600s have expired worthless with the stock near 550 the entire time! Unheard of
"nasdaq underwhelming, nvidia still solid as a rock"
"still over 20% off its high, excellent entry into company that is at the heart of every secular growth industry of the world: data center, AI, autonomous (not just vehicles but within every sector including industrial AI), gaming...so many growth drivers."
the answer is yes until you run out of gold fillings
"Nvidia is my largest holding and highest conviction long term pick. In at an average cost of $165, but I will never sell a share. I plan to hold well into the maturity of its' business and will be happy living off of their dividends 30, 40 or 50 years in the future. Invest long and prosper ."
Is it out yet?
"INTC's decision not to outsource their chip making has put names like AMD and NVDA in extremely fertile soil. Look for these two names to wake up from their slumber soon and take out 100 and 600 respectively. It's not a question of if they will do it but when. Patient longs will be rewarded, while the weak hands will be kicking themselves for selling out before the miracle happens. Bottomline, as long as Jensen Huang and Lisa Su are the captains, the sky is the limit. Shorts will be mutilated long term."
I think I saw $580.
3 months ago Intel market cap was half NVDA now look  even lol 
This stock is definitely undervalued. Big upside to be expected...
"CHOO-CHOO!.....Nvidia price target raised to $600 from $550 at Barclays 06:49 NVDA Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $600 from $550 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst increased price targets across the semiconductor capital equipment sector. While valuations ""definitely feel uncomfortable,"" the companies offer beat and raises across the board and good visibility into Q2 given shortages, Curtis tells investors in a research note."
Global Semiconductor Revenues Rebound in 2020: 5 WinnersOne of them is of course Nvidia
"N. Korea, Iran and China are using Nvidia cards to mine Bitcoin. BIG MONEY to be made with massive mining operations, as Bitcoin keeps going up."
"Where is Needhams Rajvinder Gill. Haven't heard from him for a while.. Common man, get up there and raise the price target from $800 to $900 or something."
NVDA is a stock for the next decade. Invest long and prosper.
For crying out loud. Everything keeps making new highs. NVDA sits here at 500 stuck.
$450 is next support Coming in February at the latest
"""Corsair beats estimates as consumers turn to gaming amid pandemic"".Nvidia will knock it out of the freaking park come earnings day. Nvidia is king. Nvidia to one trillion dollars and beyond!"
Nvidia is a chip dinosaur nearly extinct. Intel Xe with its sleek new chiplet design is the future of graphics and AI.
"Loving the highs and I'm a long but I don't think the blind optimism here about the price in the upcoming weeks is realistic. We know NVIDIA has supply chain issues and can't make their new cards in sufficient quantity, they've had to start releasing older model cards again to keep up with demand, and the ARM deal is far from a done deal. This evidence suggests that they're going to miss on earnings which in conjunction with the ARM deal woes means a substantial correction in the near future is likely."
No stock ever falls from 615 to 590 and lower right before great earnings
300s
"tech such as Nvidia has been a wonderful hedge during the pandemic. However vaccines are becoming more a more available as the pandemic winds down, funds are being shifted back into travel, industrials, utilities, and hospitality since these are beaten to low prices. Investors are looking into buying those low prices as many things including states are now starting to open up to 100%. I love Nvidia but I think if you look at the NASDAQ over the past 30 days it's obvious that these prices aren't coming back for quite awhile. They need to have some corrections before the price starts to grow again. GLTA "
"I have never held a stock in my life down $25 on no news, BUT I have been short plenty of them (NVDA)"
Anyone here old enough to remember $557? Going to $460
Waiting for the mad money video to show up....can't watch it in real time in Europe. But it's probably very interesting since pps went up ah.

"This is the reason you shouldn't day trade NVDA! Just buy, hold and get rich! The AI stock of the world!"
"Stonks that undercut their 200 day MA like NVDA did then rally back above, always go WAY lower. Remember kiddies, at $615 I told you gap $504, now I am warning  you about gap $463."
Anyone buy GME 348 to 172 bought more at 198 yes 
"Clorox wipes and NVDA chips, severe shortages, Clorox stock $239 in August to $179 now. Shortages are bad since sales are made 12 months in advance."
"NVDA was $589 @ NASDAQ 9000NVDA is $530 @ NASDAQ 13,300"
336 is bo parabolic point get long there
NVDA up $5 yesterday NASDAQ up 400 today down $20 NASDAQ down 200
"What a joke, it seems like every company that has a very good future like NVDA is getting slammed but companies with bad futures soar like GME. Hopefully things will return to normality soon, but who knows it seems we are entering bear market territory"
Why would anyone still be long NVDA $482 down from $615?
Market is on fire. Forest rakers are enjoying double triple overtime. But not for nvda. Your 600 calls are a transformer fire.
NVDA gap $463 has to be filled no matter what so don’t even bother being happy 
HAHAHA now the street wants to sell you overvalued NVDA at $497.16.
"Nvidia will close green so all you dysfunctional hacks can get back in your hole, and think of stupid things to say for tomorrow."
a 6mo consolidation phase leads to the next breakout highergo nvda
Nice closing.
"I think the Reddit traders will take this stock to $700 in a few days. Never stand in front of a mob, you could get stampeded."
nvda breaks out. It could go much high!!!
Nvda is making me a millionaire!
interesting how it pulled back a little bit
Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $575 at Piper Sandler 06:14
OMG  my weekly 540 puts are up 160% today wow 
People are posting wrong data here. Nvidia was never above $500 in last July. It crossed $500 in late August. Do research before you make any decisions
Who’s in at $540? Raise their hands 
"94 PE, Price to sales 35, ARM fiasco...oh no ! $575-580 close today and $500 after earnings. Nobody wants high PE tech stocks. My BIIB, MA, AXP are rocking today."
Everyone in here recall Kevin saying gap needs to be filled $504 when it was $614? And to buy GME after it fell from $500 to $39? Anyone make tens of millions like me?
I can’t even imagine being long NVDA now/impossible to even comprehend for me
"While a good deal of NVIDIA’s success in servers over the last decade has of course come from their proficient GPUs, as a business NVIDIA these days is much more than a fabless GPU designer. With more software engineers than hardware engineers on staff, it’s software and ecosystem plays that have really cemented NVIDIA’s position as the top GPU manufacturer, and created a larger market for their GPUs. At the same time, it’s these ecosystem plays that have allowed NVIDIA to build a profit-printing machine, diversifying beyond just GPU sales and moving into systems, software, support, and other avenues.To that end, NVIDIA this morning is formally rolling out a new ecosystem play aimed at high-end deep learning servers, which the company is branding as NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Soft-launched back in the fall, today the company is giving the program a more proper introduction, detailing the program and announcing some of the partners. Under NVIDIA’s plan, going forward customers can opt to buy NVIDIA-Certified systems if they want an extra guarantee on system performance and reliability, as well as opt in to buying support contracts to get access to direct, full-stack technical support from NVIDIA... https://www.anandtech.com/show/16452/nvidia-launches-server-certification-program-offering-direct-technical-support"
Know what I miss? The $400’s and NVDA. Well you won’t be missing it anymore
I notice no one is making fun of my GME now $39 to $200 in a week or my NVDA short $615 to $450 in two weeks
$545...Give me $555 today or I hold out till $575 next week.
"The “overhead” pressure now on NVDA after falling from 615 to 515 in a week, anyone sell yesterday at 557?"
"Anyone “screen shot”  $500? I did, if anyone wants I can send them a copy. Who would have ever thought  NVDA could be $500? Unless of course you bought $589 last July or $615 two weeks ago "
Let’s try something new today: WHAT TIME  RED? (A) 9:30  am EST(B) 9:31am EST(C) 9:32am EST(D) 9:33am EST

"Hey  remember the person who bought 2 shares at $593+ and I begged them to sell at $592, pleaded with them, they will be down $200 by Wednesday night GUARANTEED!!!"
"If you don't own amc you really don't like money, only 2M shortable shares available, gama and short squeeze coming, undelivered shares are still to be bought. Going to be massive."
NVDA is a chip stock. Chip stocks are boom/bust cyclical in nature. QCOM INTC AMD the 3 other fabless chip companies all fell 20% after earnings. That’s $120 in NVDA to the downside testing “her” 200 day MA.
the words are mixed up actually he means he has short loins and everything else that goes with that
spy instant pullback from 1st test of 50% retrace levelwas expectedshallow pullback is fine a collapse is not

Was a great day. I’ll give ya that. History will repeat itself. I’m banking on it. So there it is.
I LOVE NVIDIA!!!! I BOUGHT MY FIRST 1000 SHARE BLOCK IN 2011. IT WENT DOWN AND I BOUGHT 2000 MORE AT $11/12. NOW I OWN 5500 SHARES TOTAL!I HAVE YET TO SELL A SINGLE SHARE!
Am I a genius selling yesterday at $499 ? I am happy to trade $15 swing and at the end of the day 100% cash. I sleep well and don't have to watch futures at mid night.
"This has become the most predictable event in the history of man. I might just quit my job, liquidate all my assets, just so I can short the day after earnings. and then buy 1 day later. One could simply retire doing this strategy for NVDA stock. LMAO"
"This is how the stock market SHOULD be run.1. No shorting -- if you don't believe in a company don't buy their stock.2. No day traders -- if you purchase a stock you must hold it for 5 days before you can sell it.3. No algorithms -- If these giant company's want to sell stock then hire more people to buy and sell.Okay, I feel better now....."
Will be down $50 tomorrow minimum save this brilliance NVDA R.I.P. it’s all about GME
NVDA will never see $500+ ever again after today save this post
How's that 600$ price tag???
S&P hits 4K will be the start of another big correction.asset bubbles abound

Let’s all get together and embrace hold hands  and tell KEVIN he’s a genius $504
Down $15 from highs we have all seen this pattern before tomorrow is sub $130 and Friday sub $120. Good luck to all
"so, concerning the semiconductor shortage... will NVIDIA be able to have 50% more product to sell a year from now? the demand will be there, but how about the semis?"
NVDA will settle around $299 next week. Save this post
fed got our back with unlimited fake money!!! I shall not be moved
"Sell Nvidia, no one needs their GPUs. Oh wait...hold on let me just finish this game."
The FED did its part yesterday! NVDA’s been clear for launch!
Gaps 532 & 504 upward gaps always fill Downward gaps never do 580
All posts mentioning huang and yahoo deletes. I wonder why?
thanks for the discount. just bought 5 more shares...
May have sold my $390.00 puts to soon
UNFORTUNATELY the high-PE growth stock trade is DEAD... NVDA's going back down to $460./share and staying around there for a while. Sorry bulls.
let's go baby let's go to 700$
"interesting eh? We'll see....""An indicator that has been historically accurate in marking a bottom in the stock market flashed again this week for the fourth time since 2012, according to a Thursday note from Fundstrat's Tom Lee.Volatility in the stock market spiked as a rapid rise in interest rates derailed high growth stocks. The Nasdaq 100 is off 7% from its February 16 high, while the S&P 500 is down 3% over that same time period.The 10-year US Treasury note spiked to a cycle high of more than 1.50% on Thursday, and interest rate volatility saw its biggest spike since March of 2020, as measured by the CBOE Interest Rate Volatility Index.But according to Lee, the volatility in interest rates feels ""capitulatory,"" which could lead to gains ahead for stocks.Lee highlighted that soaring interest rate volatility, coupled with an extended 30-week rate of change, occured on the following dates: June 24, 2013, October 15, 2014, March 19, 2020, and February 24, 2021.What's significant about the first three of these dates is that after each of these instances it marked the bottom in the stock market ""to the day,"" Lee said.

"""freedom liked freedom's comment""how sad "
I bought some today
The mighty Nvidia powers forward while the Nasdaq is weak today. Just another day in the world of Nvidia investor.
This is the week where I finally buy again at 504.
Nvidia chip is a huge dinosaur. Intel's Xe graphics chip is brand new design using chiplets. Enough said.
CNBC is playing this stock down before earnings. Which means they are drawing in the shorts. Get ready for a short squeeze AH. Lift off BABY.
Hold NVDA for the next decade and grow very rich.
Unlike like the massive fall from $292—> 135this next annihilation will dwarf that. $615—-> 380
Super beat... see you at 650s
Disclosure: $525 short was largest in a long time R.I.P. NVDA
"Didn't get NVDA at $505 but added LRCX at $505 this morning, my largest holding since 1990."
I am begging  you all sell $559 here NVDA will never ever be this high again ever!
"Skyworks knocked it out of the park with earnings! Marvell, Qorvo, Skyworks on fire!Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
"Had to walk away for an hour is NVDA still $519? Funny thing is that when it went from $615 to $463, there wasn’t one uptick, now still down $110 it only down ticks"
The open interest is weighted far too heavily on just out of the money calls - we're probably stuck here in the short term until those get flushed out.
I suggest you all watch the show Billions on ShowTime if you want to see what we are all about here at my firm
"NVDA bagdolders conference scheduled For Feb 25, pls bring your own chair and coffee."

This stock is ready to pop like an oversized Zit. 
"Hey  longs, so it’s down $70 this week into earnings, which means instead of dropping $200 on Wednesday night, it will only go down $130. It’s actually better."

"""NVIDIA on Tuesday announced more than 70 new laptops will feature GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop GPUs and unveiled the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card for desktops.""70 new laptops with GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop GPUs! 70! SEVENTY!!"
"Back in for $40,000. Let’s see if the week leading up to earnings will be good :) I always wanted a long term position in nvda. Hopefully this will be it."
Remember there is a great shortage of chips. Even the private sector is asking the government to help set up new facilities to expand production. WOW! Even the Biden administration having mentioned a chip shortage . Great sector to invest. Buy individual companies or buy FSELX Fidelity semiconductor sector. Other family of funds may also offer similar products
What are we looking at pps with this chip shortage? Btw been in NVDA since $85 other than Apple my largest holding!

"fact: benjo, kyle, kevin, sal ...have been wrong 100pts ago and said we would see 400's and even 300's ...Well guess what boys? 650 is coming soon."
Ladies & Germs  boys & girls what time red? Gap 504 & 532 need filling. NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. Asking for a friend. WHAT TIME RED 
Nice to see weak hands shaken out before ER... LOL
this is one of the few stocks I hate cause I can never successfully trade it lol
Anyone buy GME @ $44 today? You all knew this was coming! $150 now going to $500
Relax folks - it can up and down in the short term... But $700 by next ER is my guess. Best.
"Somewhere between 700 and 800 this time next year, whether arm buyout clears or not. So why should I panic? Got more cash to add if necessary."
Wanted to sell partial when hit 300% return but now I’m long term greedy
Stock has been trading sideways for such a long time. When will it start to pop up?
several seasoned traders/investors repeatedly stated the pullback sub 500 was a screaming buy opportunity
"Shorts in here acting like this isn't going to rebound. You forget Nvidia AI is the #1 for EVs, were in a chip shortage, and GPU's are sold out the second they're restocked. Enjoy your shorts while it lasts."
$610.89? Omgggggg Just looked now! Please tell me you all sold and shorted
"NVDA never  ever went up when the NASDAQ rose 5000 straight points, BUT it’s sure a leader on the way down! $504 or bust"
"Some people can't hold their own urine, much less nvda."

"Wow, they getting this thing back to even today? Impressive recovery."
"NVDA seems really cheap compared to Shopify, Zoom, Twilio, etc..."
I am looking for 472 or lower.
I read 1000 posts last night: “NVDA will be up $650 tomorrow.” How’s that working for you at $550?
Not impressed; but better than down. The day that NVDA continues to go up while NASDAQ and DOW go down will be a good day for NVDA. Needs to stand on it's own two feet.
Why are we down today? Does the market not like better than expected earnings and bullish outlook?
Dropping like a prom dress  on a warm  summer eve
WOW  up a penny in after hours wow 
When the night is darkest and all the talking heads are telling you to sell - buy buy buy.
"Nvidia price target raised to $700 from $600 at Raymond James Raymond James analyst Chris Caso raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $700 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares following January quarter results. Nvidia's report was ""strong,"" guiding revenue 18% ahead of consensus for Q1 mainly led by Gaming, but with all segments ahead of expectations, Caso tells investors in a research note. While crypto will be a concern given the unsustainable crypto revenue back in 2018, Caso says the company appears to be taking steps to minimize that as a percent of revenue, and the gaming market is clearly much stronger than the 2018 cycle."
MU & WDC two memory chip makers have doubled while NVDA hasn’t moved in 6 months 
Last NVDA earnings $540 blowout earnings upped guidance “running on all cylinders” right to $510
"Put a 6 month chart of chip maker MU over NVDA: one was $45 now $100, one was $589 now $548! YOU CHOSE POORLY"
Zero percent chance NVDA closes above $600. Less than zero. Short accordingly
Cathie Wood keeps buying this one every single trading day since Dec 2020. Stay long and strong NVDA!
NVDA should do a 4 to 1 stock split. Targets of 800 bucks and great quarters. Projected of 5 billion profit in a quarter.. this stock should take off soon.
The ship has been righted as expected. Hopefully no one here jumped ship during the two weeks of rough seas. The vessel is sturdy and captain Jensen is seasoned and steady at the helm.
Didn’t anyone see INTC AMD & QCOM after their supply constraint earnings? All down 15-20%. That would be down $110!
"This looks like ""capitulation"" unless the market is going to lower the P/E to 10-15 like bank stocks.......brutal"

For crying out loud.
Here comes Kevin’s next imaginary Short at $593.65! 
I was asking a few people if they like NVDA @ 540 on late Wednesday or $504 early Friday
"well well well...it most certainly was worth the wait. Thanks shorties for adding fuel to the fire... One person's pain is another person's gain. Or something like that. Make us rich, boys."

tech stocks getting whipped like a rented mule
NVDA will never ever see $500+ after today ever. I honestly think  it goes to $300 by next week!
Give back $15 pleaseeeeeee
"Just buy some GME here with me, I guarantee you won’t lose. It’s exactly $100 right now. Zero risk"
"$463 $463 $463 is a lock. 100%. When NVDA was $614 I called for $504 at least 1000x. Everyone laughed at me. Price targets all $800. Yet when it hit $504 to $463, not one person said I was right. Here at my inner loin $513 it will be $463 soon and no one will say I was right."
Are u joking right now
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!DON'T BE LEFT BEHIND!CHOO CHOO!
"Kevin, Trapper Keeper, and the 2 dozen larry's are all paid hedge fund schills! The short ratio on this stock is huge right now and the broader market is not playing along with their plans to short this to the ground. Tepper ended this rotation out this morning and the 10 year yiled will not go over 1.60. Today is their make or break day. Do not sell your shares to them and buy more if you can. If you are long put in a sale price 100 points higher so they cannot short or borrow your shares. This thing could trade up like GME if you are smart and resist that is why they are on here 24/7."
"Ladies & Gentlemen, boys & germs , WHAT TIME  RED tomorrow? Down $50? Imagine if Bitcoin weren’t $60,000+ where NVDA would be? I say down $200 this week again like 2 weeks ago, then I may cover some"
"""every disadvantage has its advantage"" a famous Dutch soccer player once said. So I added at 500. It's all good . Well for me that is."

"Telling you, this dipping below $480 today was a steal. Money will gravitate back into this stock. Money managers need to find return somewhere. Can't trade up Honeywell to $300 a share, and Boeing is still mismanaged. Tech companies are some of the best run companies on the market."
Giga is spreading false earnings info. IGNORE
Glad it's not mid 400s anymore but lots of mixed signals in the charts here.
$615 NVDA is some pipe dream  no different than Zoom $590 PYPL $309 & TSLA $902
"Heard NVDA will gap down $50 tomorrow morning, just made new lows of the day! Bottom isn’t even close so over priced"
Her 200 is 498 and that’s one gap BUT how about 463? 
One of these days real soon the NASDAQ will fall 1000+ in a day
600 soon
NASDAQ -300 NVDA -$40NASDAQ +350 NVDA +$20LOL 
"This stock traded SO obvious. Didn’t move for 7 months then suddenly goes from 515 to 615 fake breakout all the weak shorts panic and cover, the longs get giddy and think  it’s going to $700, and bam  one week later $450, so all the weak shorts lost and all the bag holding longs are stuck"
The common theme. DAYS LOWS. Better buy more jagoffs
NVDA will open under $500 tomorrow fill the 504 gap then head to 488! It’s going to get really ugly quick
I think Cramer needs to retire before he costs more people their hard earned money.
I love being on a galloping horse 
Anyone in here old enough to remember +$5 yesterday with the NASDAQ up 400? POOF all gone goodbye 
NVDA will never ever see $500 again after this week
"Pathetic performance by this stock at the end of the day. There is a very motivated group of sellers or no buyers. Either way, concerning. Should have been an up $15-20 day."
"the main reason for the chip shortage, per this analyst, is ""the breadth of demand""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lNxjwStoUU"
This is a perfect opportunity to buy on a dip just before another blow out earnings report. These are the types of situations I patiently wait for to add to my positions.
Anything under $600 is a steal. Buy with both hands. $1200 by EOY. 
#FACTSNVDA $589 August 20206 months laterNVDA $588NASDAQ +5000 since August Any questions? Asking for a friend
Split!!!!!
NVDA back to the exact penny it was 7 months ago. Good luck  to all longs!
I STARTED BUYING NVIDIA IN 2011 @ $25. BOUGHT 1000 SHARES. IT WENT DOWN. MORE THAN CUT IN HALF. I BOUGHT 2000 MORE AT $11/12. LAST TIME I BOUGHT WAS MARCH LOWS $185 NOW I OWN 5500 SHARES. SO HAPPY! WE LOVE CEO JENSEN!
"All the CEO does is sell stock and use the stock to buy other overpriced companies like Melllanox & ARM, which keeps growth up, UNTIL it doesn’t"
$518 is the highest NVDA will ever trade again in its existence
With the chip shortage I can see us going to $1000 and if we get Arm Holdings $2000. I owned Arm Holdings for several years before SoftBank bought them. It is an incredible company and has the licensing for 95% of the chips in use today. The “N in FAANG would change to NVDA no joke. 
NVDA 650+ next week on great earnings and revenues.
might close at $600. let's hope so!
Best day to short is Friday!!! 99% RED
fortunately I took profits before ER. just wait a couple of days and buy back in
NVDA starting climb to $699/share
Next week Google and Amazon earnings. We are going to fly.
"Why is this down 2.5% for no reason, all because of opposition for the ARM deal?"
"it's all about entries/exitslike when i pounded the table at march 20 covid lows saying to buy with both fists for long-term buy n hold entries, nvda was top pickand i got large block of nvda at 185posted at at the time too"
"Maybe big players are worried about a chip supply shortage? but this should not hurt Nvidia but instead the end products - smartphones, cars and TVs."
Why is Nvidia dropping so hard?
"If you sold the NVDA 600 calls, like I have, every week of every month since August, you would have made 2400% on your money "
#FACTS: NVDA $589 to $598 since last August

Anyone like my gap fill calls at $504? Anyone going to say I was right?

"Given all the good news with EV adoption of NVDA chips, Nvidia probably should consider a 1 to 4 split. This bodes well for Apple and Tesla. Tesla might have to do another split soon."
Interesting on how all the resident reprobate Bash-Boys come out and rejoice at a down opening after moving over $600. They are still pouting that they didn't buy any Nvidia. The fun will soon be over as it turns green.
Nvidia data center biz slowed because of Intel Xe-SG1 streaming graphics chips. Figure it out.
"LRCX, NVDA $600 soon, AVGO $500. Blue horse shoe loves OPEN and LMND today."

Weak hands being shook.... same old same old.
Yesterday's lost recovered. Now in coming 3 days 10-15% more gain!! Nvidia is the real deal!!! Bull all over nasdaq.
I remember $535 before two blowout earnings reports 6 months ago. What happens when they miss and warn???

"Hey guys Just my thoughts but this stock will not reach your hopes and dreams until Arm gets out of the way. Company not giving shareholders a dime. Shorts own this stock. AMD longs same goes for you. Mergers and buyouts for longs must wait until the company wants you to move up. This game is rigged, I’ve gambled sports for 50 years and this stock market is the most corrupt event I’ve ever seen."

I will buy at 180
"My charts are for 472, and I am going to buy some at 336. Have seen this for so many years."
"Above 200 moving day average again. Hit yesterday and bounced. Went below today, but now had bounced above. If it closes above that number, that should be a very good sign."
Resusts are very good but current stock price is way ahead of its fundamentals so insiders are reaping profits by selling it now and wait to buy again when price will be around $500
Ascending pattern broken.
"Down ANOTHER $11 for no particular reason. Fear not, mega pumper Mario aka jagoff will add for the 621st time. Anyone else wondering why huangthecon hasn’t split this yet? If he did a slew of new investors would jump in and negate the volatile swings. Cant have that"
Bear market rallies including sector bear markets have sharp bounces during overall declining pattern. Get used to it and trade it.
QQQs up 5 points and this thing can't get above 500.
$552+ will never be seen ever again ever in our lifetimes; good luck and trade accordingly

NVDA trivia: Down tomorrow:(1) $50(2) $40(3) $30(4) $20
AMD and MSFT both reported great earnings. This bolds well for NVDA when it reports next month.
Jensen is really long winded. Just keeps talking. Boring CC. Destroying the stock after hours. Incredible plunge....like 40+ points from its high after hours. Never seen anything like it. Takes him 5+ minutes to answer simple question.
"Shorting the exact opening print tomorrow order in market order 9:30am ET no matter how low it is, will be my 22nd different short position into earnings next week! So simple yet so easy."
Chips stocks are underperforming because they're selling all they have.Not because there's no demand .
"They destroyed the families,they destroyed the small businesses, they destroyed the middle class, they destroyed interest rates and lured you into the ""holy grail"" of stocks market, that was never as expensive as nowadays.

"Alphabet, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm are all scared senseless by little Nvidia. The know Nvidia is becoming a tech-juggernaught who gets to call all the shots. Nvidia will be trading in the trillions.Nvidia is king. All hail the king!Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among the companies raising concerns about Nvidia's pending acquisition of ARM to antitrust officials, David McLaughlin, Ian King and Dina Bass of Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the process. At least one of the companies wants the deal killed, the reporters note. The deal is under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which has opened an in-depth investigation of the merger and has sent information demands to third parties, a source told Bloomberg. An Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement: ""As we proceed through the review process, we're confident that both regulators and customers will see the benefits of our plan to continue Arm's open licensing model and ensure a transparent, collaborative relationship with Arm's licensees. Our vision for Arm will help all Arm licensees grow their businesses and expand into new markets."""
"Massive overreaction after a great ER. Cramer pumped it and Jensen was on his show. This baby is going right back up. Look at Mar 2020 crash as well, this was quickest to recover not only in semis but entire market."
"Few companies come under the absurd microscope that Nvidia does. NVDA can blow earnings out of the water and investors will be ""concerned"" re decelerating revenue. NVDA can kill it on revenue and it's guidance that will have investors spooked. I think everyone should buy 100 shares and go to Tahiti. Upon your return you'll be a lot richer and investors will still have something to complain about."
Wow. Never thought I'd be able to load up again at this price. NICE!
I bought shares on Tuesday and sold on Wednesday before the earnings release as I correctly anticipated that the share price will decline. I may buy again today and hope to sell for a quick pop in a day or two. I am enjoying my hit & run tactics.
So what is nvidia's plan b if they can't make the arm deal happen? Does the stock trade sideways until they close or nix the deal? Thanks for any replies. Long term holder of this stock.
"Nvidia target boosted to $700 at Susquehanna ahead of earnings Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upped his price target on shares of Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -1.26% to $700 from $625 Monday, matching the highest price target among analysts surveyed by FactSet. His note comes ahead of Nvidia's Wednesday afternoon earnings report. ""From a high level, we expect another beat-and-raise quarter as continued stay-at-home dynamics, Ampere gaming ramp, and a resurgence in crypto-mining drives GPU demand to all-time highs,"" Rolland wrote. He pointed to optimism on the part of Nvidia's management team when he spoke with them in January. ""[T]hey were excited about a great holiday season and were insistent that any supply shortage is a product of the stronger than expected demand environment,"" he wrote. Shares are up 0.9% in Monday morning trading. They've gained 15% over the past three months as the S&P 500 SPX, -0.53% has climbed 9%."
"NVDA poking through upper resistance, a buy signal"
There were many weak hands selling their shares today after prices moved to the top end of the recent trading range.... for short term traders that decision could be right or wrong.... I traded this like that originally in early 2017 the stock got away and regretted the exit at 235... I was fortunate to get another chance when it dipped under 150 and decided I wouldn't ever sell it again.... the run ups are always greater than the pullbacks.... those that hold this monster long term will never regret... gl to all...
a 50% retrace of the 614 to 467 sell down takes nvda back to 540x
Gee ANOTHER bloodbath tomorrow? Why is huang still CEO?
I warned the long term NVDA bag  holders that once the broke margined Robinhood traders got in that was the end of the stock
NEW 52 WEEK HIGH.BUY NVIDIA NOW
severe shortage of chips around the world. The U.S. Industries and the U.S. Government has mentioned that and so have the Chinese etc. The U.S. industries have requested the Federal Government to fund the expansion of the production facilities. Buy NVIDIA and others or you can buy a semi-conductor Mutual Fund such as FSELX etc. I bet you and I are sitting on a boom the like of which we have never heard of seen in our lives.
This stock has enormous interest because of its unlimited growth prospects.
"Man, when this “thing” falls, it drops like under pants  on prom night"
@kevin > Are you going to keep your word?Legend18 hours agoMy GME and NVDA hit $500 tomorrow or I never come in here again. GME will rise $300+ and NVDA will fall $30
$60 GONE in 6 days that’s so awesome
"When it eclipsed 400, I thought a split should have occurred. Considering the psychology of a retail trader, many stay away from high priced stocks; especially in the semiconductor business. A case can be made to not split in the attempt to prevent a runaway PE. Regardless, if management has been considering a split, it may be wise to wait until things cool off and we get back over 600."
Where were the Reddit traders today.
"For those of you not familiar with the chip industry. I’ve seen some posts suggesting Nvidia profits are going to drop with Ethereum 2.0 and EIP 1559 in July. Although both of these will have a large effect on GPU mining it’s true. You’ll see the mining industry start to lose pace this summer as miners sell off their cards before the jacked up prices begin to fall. Nvidia are not the ones making the money on these jacked up prices to begin with.. it’s aftermarket and scalpers. When mining goes away Nvidia GPUs will continue to fly off shelves. Gamers are demanding these cards since they came out. Gaming is also the biggest and fastest growing entertainment industry. Nvidia will have some ups and downs due to being linked with mining but this company will go nowhere but up long term. AMD is still playing catch up in the graphics department. I may not suggest when you should buy this stock but it is a great long term play. I’m a gamer and a miner so take from that what you will. Even with a silicon shortage effecting all businesses this is temporary.. the pandemic has caused a large increase to the gaming community and trust me it isn’t going to fade as things go back to “normal.” If you’re interested in this stock timing could be difficult but there is a ton of upside with their data centres, gaming and the huge possibility of the arm deal closing."
"Raise your hands bashers if you're ready to miss the next leg up. The shorts have helped me to retire sooner than expected this year so they deserve some special attention imo. It's like Valentine for shorts, lol."
Imagine voting  for Mr Weekend At Bernies and thinking the stock market wouldn’t crash
"So if you would have sold NVDA and bought NFLX like I told you, you would be up $8."
Its a great report. AH price action will not scare me.
ALOHA MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL KONA HAWAII! HEADING OUT OF HONOKOHAU HARBOR GOING FISHING FOR WHATEVER WE CAN GET INTO. LIFE IS GOOD MY FRIENDS! LIFE IS GOOD!BUY MORE NVIDIA!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
"The pullback from the highs in most tech companies, but especially the semis has been rotation and nothing more. When the rotation ends these stocks will hit new highs. Cheers."
"The best part about being short NVDA is you know when it’s down $15 it won’t bounce back a penny, BUT when it’s up $15, it’s always WHAT TIME RED by the end of the day"
Would be a real good idea to sell 600+ stock; anyone see AMD INTC QCOM after earnings? The other 3 biggest fabless chip stocks in the world. Greed
NVDA unstoppable in 2021! Yep check the summary page.
I see NVIDIA’S stock price drifting lower for the next 6-9 months.The ARM’S deal ain’t happening!!!
run shortie run
I have my good til cancel cover in at $460. Been waiting a few months but it’s coming within a week
You own a Ponzi scheme stock NVDA that is an ATM for insiders of the company love  HUANG selling $100m a week every week in 2021. That has to give you ponzi holders some confidence? The CEO selling his stonk paying 43% cap gains just to get it in cash paying 0%

Ark Investment (Cathy Wood) bought NVDA on two separate Buys today. Many Investors follow her every day trades and a very bullish signal. She has a huge following her every stock buy. We been in a trading trade now for a while. Time to break out 
"What the Reddit pundits do not say is thatNVDA, has significant earnings and has for years.Anticipated top and bottom growth is expected tobe awesome. Buying a Groovy company with no earnings and nonein near future to try and beat the hedge funds is just stupid.Check out who owns Reddit!"
NVDA will close at its lows of the day then gap down to $460 on Wednesday night. Trade accordingly
Both NVDA and AVGO hit all time highs today!
Why the 13-point drop from day's high on a very good day for the market?
$532 is a lock then $528 if that breaks $468
https://gov.capital/stock/dbksf-stock/ $nvda $cstr
So AAPL made $111.9billion in 3 months and the stock is down $5+ in after hours and you all think when NVDA reports the stock is going higher? Smoke  some more crack. What time $504? Been calling $504 from $560. Remember Superman?
Great volume and $30 below her 200 day moving average. Put up the yearly chart on NVDA from $615 to $450 without an uptick! So funny

I just ripped the loudest smelliest  gas ️  out by the Breakers Pool  and blamed it on some guy next to me who is long NVDA
"Investors are afraid the shortage may result to poorer sales, but it's just common sense. High demand + low supply = higher prices. Higher prices will make up for low sales quantities which even improves their margins. Time to load up"
and now I'm buying back very heavy
Remember Kevin has made ALL his Fantasy Money imagining NVDA'S price drop...IN HIS DREAMS!
$500 re-test coming up.Don't expect it to hold this time.
PT $800
Anyone smart in this industry knows that the ARM acquisition would never get approved. This is a good thing because the deal was way too expensive anyway. The stock should be soaring as a result of a failed acquisition.
NVDA 200 day MA is $490 We are @ $460 or soR.I.P. NVDA it’s been a nice ride from $300+ pre covid to $460Really a decent gain from low to high of 40%. I don’t count that BS $180 covid panic low
"NVDA is at 200dma and 2nd support level of the pivot , and oversold at bottom od stcochastic. RSI also at bottom. Going Bullish . Good Luck"
Better get on this dip before it’s to late!

Nvidia is the dinosaur of the graphics chips. Intel Xe is the new kid on the block. The future in graphics.
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!!!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
in my over 50 years of investing I ain't felt more confident than I feel today investing in the chip sector. I thought may be I stay quiet and don't advertise to others but then it would have been so selfish on my behalf. When the government sayeth we have a chip shortage and the private companies agree and foreign govermnents agree and are anxious it tell yo something. Folks buy into the chip sector because I am doing that too.

$600 loading. Cases going down is big news
I still can’t even comprehend how this was actually 519 today or was that a fake/trade print?
Remember when this dropped from $290 to $129? That crime spree will pale in comparison to this next evisceration. $615 ——> $450. Huang will guarantee it
Nice day trader stock today
Nvda should be trading in the $800’s.
near the lows late yesterday i stated nvda was a good company at a decent entry price for true long-term investorsand trade-types toonvda 3/10 500c from 5.5 to 14 last trade
"“We are very excited about how Veritone is leveraging the power of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platforms to streamline the management and optimization of clean energy. We believe that this will help provide more predictable and reliable energy,” said Keith Cockerham, Utilities Industry Lead at NVIDIA. “The combination of Veritone CDI and NVIDIA EGX provides the millisecond-level autonomous decision-making capabilities required for smart grid management and resiliency.”Veritone is focusing their initial NVIDIA migration efforts on energy optimization of complex smart grids, and plan to develop optimized solutions for grid and electric car batteries in the future. For grid batteries, fast and accurate modeling of batteries on NVIDIA EGX are planned to increase battery utilization, reduce the risk of thermal events and extend battery life. For electric car batteries, the two companies plan to integrate Veritone’s dynamic modeling with NVIDIA EGX, which is expected to improve range, battery longevity and reduce the risk of thermal events."
and dats dat bummer rising interest rates created an epic exodus from high beta growth stocks and rotated into financials and industrials and commodities nvda did it's job with a solid beat and raisemarket will come around to its senses and see the screaming value of nvda going forward
NVDA is going back to $299 in 2021. 100%. Please trade accordingly. This game is not hard.
ITRI now up over 20% since posting good ER early this morning
"Aapl, Amzn, Msft, and now Nvda. All had great earnings and all are lower. Big tech is not cutting it. Why do you think people are buying these garbage spacs and Gme."
"NVDA is going to $299 in March. Then I will cover and go long. Will be in here all day a perma bull, BUT not a penny before"
"This sell off has left everyone out of buying power. We all got used to quick rebounds. I’ve been buying on the way down but I’m still waiting on sidelines to buy large position. I know worst case scenario is very strong support level and absolute bottom at 375 but I don’t see it breaking much lower than where we are at. 455 is another strong support, only issue is everyone is out of cash so it could get manipulated lower. Anyways long term is key."
$504 will be here within a few minutes please trade accordingly
Slowly slowly everything is turning positive. I take this opportunity to buy more
"NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Why, after a year posting this everyday, does no one listen to me?"
Don’t worry longs this will reverse by end of day
Bottom is in

"When Kevin is Right, He is Right!Unfortunately, even at $550 he is down $400k on his shorts!!! "
"When will this market will move forward.. incurring huge loses.. #NVIDIA, NIO all sinking...Unbearable.. Sad"
How come NVDA price declined even yahoo analysts strongly advised and recommended to buy at hiked price. But something is brewing by insiders to book profits.
Funny how stocks go down between 10am-11am as traders go on break and then again between 12noon-1pm when they go to lunch.Best buying opportunity when you know when the dip is coming.
You all long and strong $615 to $468 here? Now lower than Friday crash lows with Dow up 700. 
Should hold $550 down $30 tomorrow going by the options chart
"Cathy Wood just bought 33,000 shares of NVDA. She knows it’s undervalued with big momentum on its side "
Imagine if NVDA didn’t get 5 upgrades to $700 by influential analysts from major brokerage houses ? Bwaaaa lol 
"NVDA goes to $1,000 soon."
This is deliberate price action down. They want to shake out loose hands and get in lower rate. No worries. It will be positive territory before tomorrow open.
NVDA fell 60% last March That takes it to under $300 this March
NASDAQ will be down 1000 tomorrow minimum 10 year is 1.5%
I THINK TODAY CALLS FOR A NVIDIA ROCKET. YESTERDAY WAS THE JUMP ON BOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN. TODAY IS THE NVIDIA ROCKET LAUNCH. THIS ONE'S FOR ALL THE HATERS.
"I’ve been trading 30 years. I have seen this pattern 1000x. No one could explain why a stock under performs the market by 50% for 6 months, the CEO is selling $1b in stock, and bam, “the bad news” is released with earnings, and falls 50%."
"Except for that false breakout up above 600, this stock has been in a clear bullish flag pattern on the longer term daily chart. It is testing the lower boundary of that channel but as long as the 494-500 area holds, the long term technical picture hasn't changed imo."

"$610, someone please turn the light off !"
"nvda consolidating for 6months. fang stocks report next week, if we see them pop upwards nvda will also pop up after earnings!!"
"Saw $552 and walked away from the quotes for a while. I know it fell $50 yesterday & $90 this week, is it $575 yet??"
I see NVDA $504 after earnings for sure! I also see down $50 today by the close
"surprised to see Nvida fall today, It is better than most of the Tech stuff out there."
$600 will be denied!!!!!!
"Question for serious longs. Is it too late to get into NVIDIA? The well-known idea that the higher the SP is of an equity, the lower the ROI. Curious what others think. I currently have holdings in 4 other chip stocks: QCOM, AMD, UMC, and TSM."
$504 gap now will be filled. Trade accordingly & good luck  everyone
This was a gift at $250 in March. I’m starting to consider taking some profits off the table at $600
Nvda touches $550 on Thursday with huge rally in NAS once again. 1.9 trillion actually going to real people does count after all. Markets doesn’t crash until rates go up enough where all the very interest rate sensitive derivatives blow up in to not one not two but all 5 of the too big to fail banks. This time the masters of the universe don’t get bailed out. Too bad so sad lol.
Next gap to fill $611.
@kevin > You bragged about GME last week. Down 25% TODAY. Why aren't you discussing that today?
NVDA is the future...that will help the future become a better future!!!! 5-10 YEARS STRONG!!!!! Diamond hands only!!!!! LFG!!!
NVDA is nothing more than an ATM for insiders to buy mansions cars boats strippers etc
Will be down $50 at some point today GUARANTEED
Seems like a great  short here at $510
Did NVDA split ? I bought is at $615 but my account is not showing additional shares. Oh no !
Where were you when NVIDIA got back to its normal range?
"Robin hood's rushed in for the great great NVidia bargain, buybuybuy, you have to buy as long as it's 512, fast fast already 517 buy now buy because it goes Higher"
Uh oh  I am afraid to look  I see Nasdaq is up 100 NVDA has to be like 520
i can almost hear kevin's misfiring synapse from here
what time  red tomorrow? Any good  guesses?
Wonder if the QQQ can go all the way down and fill the post election gap at $276.
Pinning my hopes on NVDA not being part of the 30% overall market drop in the coming months.
"At $481.99 I posted, go back and read it, NVDA would hit $199 before $482. Simple yet so easy"
The smartest lady in Silicon Valley ( no not CW) just sent me an alert that she is bought NVDA. Everything this woman touches goes to gold. Full disclosure I subscribe to her service.
"AAPL's trying to take out Friday's low. If it happens, it'll probably drag the whole index down with it."

"LADIES & Germs  boys and freaks, WHAT TIME $450? 9:30  am EST"
Is NVDA still up $15? I am afraid to look 
NVDA great companyHorrible stock Went from 150 to 300 back to 150 to 600 now going back to 300
NVDA all time high 614 won’t ever even come close to that again I pray down $100 today then $100 after earnings
"so the comments are nothing actually helpful, rather shorts and longs battling against who is right lmao, kinda funny to watch. If anyone wants to know what is going to happen, do you research, have your reasons for what you are doing and then follow them. GL all for earnings"
keep shorting this is great. I am loading the boat. Next year at this time NVDA should be over $800.
$625 this week no problem should see $700 before spring.
NVDA last 4 days:Down $50Up $4 (NASDAQ was +400)Down $18Will be down $50 today
"People still gambling buying inflated equities like NVDA. When the crunch comes, can't say there was no warning signs like trading at 26x revenue and PE of 100!"

No worries. It's going to pick up more investors at the cheaper price. It's going to hit 800.
"positive news for the company, catalyst for bull trend with 10 year yield on the way down"
Last days to buy at discounted price.
you had your chance
"“Rotation out of sector” is thinly veiled code for: wealthy investors do not care about the future of this country, they will not keep their holdings in badly needed sectors like chip makers if they think they can make more money on a SPAC or Bitcoin. Big money is immoral, it screwed you in ‘08, and as the yields inverse in ‘19 shows, they will screw us again, and are."
Suits are trying to weed out the gutless This is a rigged market and we are just here for donations. Hold on if you can for ARM if the market can stay afloat you will be happy

"Citi analyst Atif Malik favors semiconductor names over semiconductor capital equipment in the first half of 2021 on peaking wafer fab equipment run rate. He moved Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) to his number one pick and Nvidia (NVDA) to his number two pick. Malik lowered Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) down by two spots on his ranking list to three and four respectively, On the materials and components group, the analyst maintains Entegris (ENTG) at number one and moves II-VI (IIVI) to his number two pick. He remains Sell rated on Amkor Technology (AMKR) due to long-term margin contraction concerns and CMC Materials (CCMP) due to top line weakness and competitive threats."
Anyone see “Legend” around today? That guy is amazing & makes amazing calls. Probably the most informative poster on any Yahoo Message Board
Impressive. Shouldn't SEC investigate this manipulation ?
NVDA will be $470 after earnings or I will never post again in here
27 short positions from 468 last July to 614 and haven’t covered one share 
"$100,000,000,000 knocked off NVDA market cap in a week LOL while INTC has gone up!!!!"

Kevin is ashamed to post so he is posting under the name Darth Trader
they are shorting 2 shares at a time. what a joke
NVDA 515 is my #1 short ever in 30 years of trading short it buy outs sell calls

Where is that bear that wanted 515? Better get in before 615.
NVDA +$564 = Superman + Kryptonite zzzzzzz 
Charts for 336..no support before 472
"Nice pre earnings move. These results being reported bode well for NVDA. Let’s see if we can get 550 tomorrow, 600 after earnings."
It seems like a new economy has emerged. An economy where companies on the verge of bk could triple in a matter of 3 hours and companies with solid eps could crash
"Strong price action, most on my watchlist are red."

$700 Near term price target 1-4 weeks.
Nvidia has sold every 3000 series GPU they've ever made since October and still it's not enough for the demand.
Down $50 tomorrow is my lock of the century sub $500 then AMD releases their new gaming card next week and BAM down another $100!! Save this brilliance
"BITCOIN REACHED ALL NEW RECORD HIGH OVER $52,000....AND SO NVDA WHICH INVESTED HEAVILY IN BITCOIN MACHINES WILL GREATLY BENEFITS FROM IT....BUY MORE NVDA FOR GREAT E/R AHEAD NEXT WEEK....BY TODAY 'S DIP 'S BEST FOR MORE PROFITS LATER....."
Tremendous buying into the close and after. The infamous head fake earlier in the day to shake out some weak hands and traders and then VRoooom! NVidia always retraces to its previous high so we will get back over $600 and then onto $650. IMHO 
612.70 now
"Let me ask you longs a serious  question: When the NASDAQ rose 500 points the other day and NVDA was up $1, why didn’t you sell and short? It was $557"
"As I said, $500 by the weekend, $103 by the year"
Cathy Wood is looooooosing money. Looks like she bought my shares at $555. Oh No !
See you in the late summer @ 675 / 700
NVDA is going to rise tomorrow. Other hedge fund is going to invest into nvda. NVDA is going to join with Nio and help produce chips for them.
NVDA has some decent support $520 for now
Nvidia to one trillion dollars market cap. Soon.Nvidia is king!
chronics always squeal the loudest at the lowsalways

"When poeple finally realize Nvidia is the ""picks and shovel"" behind all EV.Li auto uses NvidiaNio uses NvidiaXpeng uses NvidiaAlibaba (Saic) uses NvidiaAmazon Zoox uses Nvidia"
"If MSFT and AAPL are going to produce their own chips, they must buy AVGO, AMD, NVDA outright. My money in on NVDA and AVGO."

"The GJJ supercomputer was much better than Alllllllllll the mother supercomputers put together. That’s why GJJ told you that the 600 calls were worthless for as far as the eye could see. I didn’t read that in a book. Because the “book” tells you that options follow stock prices. But that dumb book was written before weekly options and before supercomputers, high frequency traders, and AI algorithms reading your social posts. You can deep fry that book and serve it with sauce."
"I'm buying more if we dip below $500. Not concerned about the sideways action, NVDA is one of my largest and most profitable holdings."
August 2020 NVDA $589+March 2021 NVDA $550
Nvidia price target raised to $700 from $600 at Oppenheimer
Gap @ $463 needs to be filled Zero doubts about it Trade accordingly You likey $519? LOL 
"Sal,The idea is to buy low. I bought 4,000. shares of NVDA several years ago at $15. and could not be happier with the company. You try to get on the bus 25 minutes after it left the station"
Every conversation in every script in yahoo messenger post as if that stock is going to hit roof without put any basis. It is better if we discuss the plus and minus honestly without depending on what the sponsored advertisements say ..please discus only any real happening and avoid sponsored posts
"6 months of gains gone, love the Byedon market"
596 to 586 in mere seconds Not for the feint of heart

No split = sell?
"I buy and sell this one regularly, would’ve made more if I were to hold though, clearly a superior company when it comes to kids and graphics cards, no end in sight either"
"Someone asked today why I spend my entire life trolling and abusing garbage  stocks/companies like NVDA? Well, I am like the lead guy in the show Billions. I just use different methods within my firm to get stonks to “react”. I spot trash  like NVDA with real weak broke amateur Reddit Robinhood margined shareholders and short away. I never have lost ever"
NASDAQ up 50NVDA down $10Any questions?
Imagine betting against nvidia while the crypto market is exploding
Anyone who is selling bc NVIDIA isn’t hitching their wagon to Bitcoin doesn’t understand NVIDIA and deserves to lose money.
"OMG  Did you all see this? NVDA is up a penny .01 in after hours. The crash has stopped. No worries longs, everything is great. Only has to rise $42 to break even from almost this morning! $606 this am, remember? My god"
When is this OINKER  going to begin dropping like a rock like it’s done every day since July
"Have the shareholders voted on the ARM deal? If so, what was the outcome, and how was the stock price affected?"
"$504 today easily Good luck to all who listened to me from 615FreeDUMB 6500 shares down $100Is $650,000 lost "
a whacked out care-facility schizophrenic delusionally believes he controls the market and high-volume large cap tech stockomglols
"I wanted to stay quiet and since it worked well for me to invest in the chip sector but then I realized I need to share my secret with others namely that the chip sector is booming. The Chinese are experiencing a severe shortage, the United States government is experiencing a severe shortage and so are the companies such as GM and Ford etc. An appeal has been sent out to the United States government to help establish more manufacturing facilities. I feel absolutely fantastic about this sector. My advise buy individual companies or by FSELX from Fidelity. I am sure there are other family of funds which provide semiconductor funds . I am very happy to share this with you"
But I know it will be well past 600 in twelve months!
I did say red
Once again longs have been “Huanged”
615—-466 effincrooks
"“Bashers only go after stocks that are going upwards or have excellent potential to go up. Bashers get left behind, so they want to bring the price down to be able to get in at a great price.”.So True!"
Did I say $20? This chingarbage will start a new norm. $30 drops
Anyone know what happened? My watchlist went from 90% green to 90% red in 30 minutes or so? Nasdaq now going back up again.
50% of all recent military discharges now instantly file multiple claims for lifetime govt disability up from less than 2% in 2000 to 50% last year
"Indices rising and this sliding PM......ok, time for everyone’s favorite game....... “what time red?”"
Buy?or not buy? This is a question!
$600 is so close I can taste it 
"Hint to longs: When you own a growth technology stock like NVDA and they suddenly offer a dividend, it’s time to sell & short"
Jerome is going to make it all OK today with help from Janet....no worries mates
NASDAQ DOWN 500 POINTS!BUY STOCKS.GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITYSTART DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN!
"Darth Trader nearing his 15,000th post! Wow!!!You must work weekends too."

NVDA wiped out all the bloated weekly call options again LOL  like clockwork for 7 months now every week same story
NVDA down $7 is it’s best day in a month lol 
way way overdone
Tomorrow the reddit crowd could jump in. Be prepared for lift off.
I truly hope that someone listened to me and sold half and kept half to let it ride greed is one of the 7 deadly sins do not get caught up in all these calls for 600 be smart
Will be interesting to see what this thing does with 500. Could be a massive short squeeze there.
"Nvidia is set to release its latest quarterly report at a tricky moment in the semiconductor industry. There aren't enough chips for products ranging from cars to the graphics cards made by Nvidia, and far too many buyers.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for Nvidia's (ticker: NVDA) videogame chips has far outpaced the number of consumers seeking the cards that include them. Prices remain high in secondary markets, reportedly double what the company recommends, well over a quarter after the Ampere-based chips became available.As irked as gamers -- or cryptocurrency miners, another group of buyers -- might be by the lack of supply, the surging demand has driven up forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter sales in Nvidia's videogame segment to $2.39 billion. That is nearly half of the overall revenue of $4.82 billion Wall Street expects. It would be the greatest dollar amount the videogame segment has generated in Nvidia's historyThe consensus estimate for adjusted per-share earnings is $2.81 a share."
Well it was a good couple days. Does NVDA usually trade up to down before earnings?
S0S short Sellers dont say I didn't warn you.
"NVDA “dip buyers” R.I.P. ROTFLMFAO at all longs who don’t realize the power of my firm.FREE-DUMB 6000 shares long NVDA x $50 loss = $300,000. Umm, no more trips, no more skiing  no more nothing but Mom’s basement with wood  panels"
So down $20 yesterday on huge volume up $5 today on zero volume
Is this Kevin the old Larry? this forum is dominated by bears now...where's Kal?
The best bet is to short every stock before earnings. It seems to work.
"NIO YF board is rather excited for the partnership with NVDA announced today. Welcome, partners (smile). We can expect this to be long-term, as NIO production ramps up and up, including globally.Do take a look at NIO's new (first) ET7 sedan, showcased as well today, on YouTube. Gawd, the thing is a beauty. All seats even come with massage (smile). But the tech (including AI and voice recognition) in this car is multiples of Tesla's (at this juncture). Apparently, NIO felt they needed NVDA to help with that. The TSLA Model 3 instantly looked its age today."
Looks like we have rested long enough. Time to march on.
"I say down $20 tomorrow NVDA Not even down $10 today, which I predicted. Will be $460 after earnings. Feel bad for anyone who bought over $460!"
Why is a $700. stock selling so CHEAP?
CONGRATULATIONS NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY TO BUY!WELCOME TO THE NVIDIA FAMILY YOU WILL BE RICH SOON!!!
"nvidia chipset going to be the foundation of skynet, goodluck when the ai take over"
I still can’t believe NVDA was up 2 days in a row before this deep BLOOD  RED DAY TODAY! Anyone here old enough to remember +$15?
NVDA will fall $100 by the close on the missed earnings
Needless to say that their consumer cards (gaming and mining combined) could almost double in sales then. Great news. (and something that I thought was in the pipeline for some time)
600 wall coming up my friends... Best.
"it's just like other big tech, huge beat but still cannot be up :Dsell the news @@"
It feels really good being short a stock like NVDA that’s so top heavy it can never go higher ever
"sorry guys, fully cashed out today on NVDA, made small money, but too crazy these days, need more cash aside...good luck everyone"
I recall almost buying here to add a few months back.
"To bashers, spammers, suicide-paper-shorts; zip it and die. Thanks in advance."
NVDA $470.54 or undervalued AMD or Inferior Intel?
"Anytime Kevin starts saying NVDA will never be a certain price ever again, I start buying. It’s proven every single time to make me money. Thank you Kevin"
back to 200s?
why doesn't btc put all the number crunching and energy consumption towards solving the supernova explosion in govt disability rolls and the explosion in the professional homeless with severe drug/alcohol addictionswe know what the end calculation would be:cut off the chronics and ship them and the professional homeless to fema camps in remote deserts with no internet access that's the only calculation that makes sense
"Just wondering if much of yesterday's rally were buys by those thinking the earnings call was on Feb 11? Over the weekend, I watched 2 new videos about NVIDIA, both said earnings were on the 11th (rather than the correct Feb 24th date)."
Will close today down $10 then down $10 tomorrow and Friday
Anyone here old enough to remember $500+??????
NASDAQ TECH FIRE SALE! TEMPORARY SECTOR ROTATION.BUYING OPPORTUNITY GIFT.BUY BUY AND BUY MORE!
This is total b.s.
"Huang and Nvda board, I hope is smart people to run the company..there is a lot of momentum in the stock market in general due to various factors...If nvda board takes a page out of Apple and Tesla, industry leaders in their respective field than splitting the stock makes sense. Let’s say pre earnings stock price is $650 and if the earnings reported on 24th feb is way better than expected then if they announce 4 to 1 split.. stock could run up to $800 or more.Post split price of $200..Two or three quarters of solid returns after split on strong chip demand should bring price of nvda back to close to $400 andif ARM deal goes through or not as per nvda board thinks it may take 18 months.. this stock has room to grow just like appl and tsla and back to $600, if no deal than it may lose 20-25% at most and back to $300 still a much better price ($1200)JMOGOOD LUCK ALL"
Been selling calls shorting stock and buying puts all say since 555 NVDA while I buy calls sell puts long AMD
"Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $610 at Susquehanna, BUYSusquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $625 from $610 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst met with management who communicated the demand backdrop is very, very healthy. He believes any supply shortage is because demand is so strong not the impact of industrywide shortages. Rolland is encouraged by the demand but believes industrywide shortages could limit the most optimistic of bull scenarios."
TRXC is up 25% today. Just got FDA approval for robotic surgery.Intuitive Surgical has some competition now.
"Finally, a respectable correction in the technology sector. There are some sweet opportunities today in $NVDA, $LRCX, $AMAT and $KLAC to name just a few. I just started buying mid day and you should too."
Relax longs. weak hands are out...tome for 650-750 in a few weeks is my guess. do your own diligence.
"OK NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS, LET'S LAUNCH A NVIDIA ROCKET TODAY. HERE WE GO....BLAST OFF!"
Would be positive to end above the 200 day moving average of 489.65. Bounced off this morning and now above it as I write this.
"one month ago, 17th Feb this stock was at circa $590, today apparently there's a world semi conductor chip shortage and it's sitting at $531....pull the other one, it's got bells on"
more pain tomorrow. 20 billion in sales for the year 390 billion market cap. gl.
"Nvidia will close green, and the shorties will be pouting as they wait in line for dinner at the soup kitchen."
"If Jensen Huang can pump stock as Musk does on Twitter, NVDA should be $10,000 a share now."
need to chill and have patience whole matket is down.. it will recover soon
Anyone here like $615 to $470 without an uptick. Kathie Woods ARK is down 30% this year and we are only in March
Anyone knows when is earning date
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME! COUNT DOWN TO EARNINGS FEBRUARY 11TH!GET IN NOW!
I feel like a long since I bought in at like $398 or something like that.
"1 year or year chart people. we are waiting on earnings for a real move up or down! It is however, following a bullish wedge pattern the past months. Patience."
$NIO $WIMI $NVDA Pre-market is telling us that investors are buying the dip. Just like what will happen tomorrow.
Nicely done NVDA. Upwards and Onwards! 
Just another normal NVDA type day....-$20!!!!
In the wise words of Nelson Muntz; Hah..! Hah..!!
Honestly doesn’t anyone in here know anything about how to trade? The stock is $540 the 50 day is $540. The open interest is HUGE weekly 540 calls. You all knew it would crash and did nothing. Lazy perma bull buy & hold longs
quarterly sales top 5 billion for first time. 390billion market cap. ok..
"When Cramer the rookie and Cathie Woods of ARKK get involved with any stock, run for zee hills"
This could drop to $500 or below next week
Kevin? Thoughts?
"Zero chance Nvidia will get approval to acquire ARM.QCOM, MSFT, GOOGLE, AMZN, UK, EU , China are all against it."
"Another upgrade:""Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar maintains NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $575 to $625."""
"For newcomers to semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stock investing initially you'll experience something similar to shaken baby syndrome but after a year you won't feel anything and you'll just keep adding shares during opportunities in the violent action. You'll get up in the morning grab some snacks sit at your trade station, read this board, have a few laughs and make good money."
"10 year is ready to go below 1.55, NVDA goes to $500, watch and learn."
Some big holder is divesting its position. once done in day or two it will fly
Kevin placed on ignore
