"Split it, more shorts coming will drive the price lower. Good opportunity to get in much cheaper."
"This is much to about nothing. A tempest in a teacup. Perhaps a ploy to get some concessions from NVDA as per guarantee employment numbers and buildout of facilities. The Brits want this deal to go through too. Although a fabulous company, AH would grow nowhere close to where they will be without NVDA’s expertise and involvement. Ie. A Buying opportunity. "
Technology is turning positive. I am sure Nasdaq will soon turn positive and Nvidia is not that far behind. Honestly buy more into technology as the tail end of this week and the next week will show explosive results for the quarter ending March 2021. But the foolish shorts listening to CNBC and Cramer and Suzy etc.
next station rest $666
"AS predicted by me, the first upgrade is in. Overweight from key Bank analyst John"
Ended lower but mounted a counter attack. Tomorrow will be an up day
Looks like the NVDA-ARM deal is R.I.P.  HUGE problems in China  now where they can’t oust one of the heads of China ARM and he won’t allow the deal to get done. They are saying about two years from last September which will put this brutal acquisition to 2023. Have fun with that anchor
"Buy the foundry tech stocks. look at ASML and LRCX after hours. Intel building 2 fabs, $20 billion spend."
GREEN GREEN! LETS GOOO!! Got my NVIDIA T-shirt in mail today too! Sharing site in case anyone else is interested  https://stockjunkies.ca/collections/nvidia-nvda

All you TARDS not take it off the chin enough this week? $649 to $560? NVDA R.I.P.
"New highs are coming in next week, I think it will cross $650 before may 15"
"Barrons: Automotive is a $8b revenue pipeline in future - linkIn a note Tuesday, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said his team is now viewing the company’s auto revenue as its “newest pillar for growth.” Though the segment fell 23% last year, the declines were mainly because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Schafer wrote. He pointed out that executives highlighted an “$8 billion revenue pipeline by 2027” with a sharp rise in by 2024. The company’s deal with Mercedes will likely lead to similar arrangements with other auto makers."
Just sell all NVDA buy put options leaps and weekly and sell every call  you can get your hands on! R.I.P.

"Reminder, overhyped Nvidia was overvalued at $648, still overvalued at $574.05 vs Undervalued AMD $78.18 with the best modern products in the market at 7nm."
https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-has-only-10-chance-of-closing-uk-deal-citi-analyst-says-5161894892510% chance if closing arm deal seems a little to high.

$580 down $15 pre market on no news down from $650 YET no one in here ever congratulates me on never being wrong. Weird. 
Looks like the rotation from the DOW back into tech may be starting.
Broker said money coming back to Technology in a big way. Thanko
This little PIGGY  still up $10 pre market? I am not near a PC or cellular device NVDA R.I.P. 
Anyone in here ever hear of NVDA before? I am new but I heard it’s cheaper now $560 then it was in July of 2020 when it was $589. Why do I keep hearing how great this stock is when it’s up 0% over a year now? My Bitcoin is up like 700%
"Missy Dot will be back soon, just cleaning up after her Motel 6 rendezvous."
"When it hits $290, I'm in. That is a reasonable p/e at that level."
I don’t own Tesla That stock is so shorted I feel bad for them as
$773 coming soon
LUCKILY THE MARKETS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX INCREASE WILL BE ENACTED OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN 1000 OR 2000 ON THE DOW. SO THE MARKETS SHOULD STABILIZE FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL THE TIME COMES AND THE CAPITAL GAINS ISSUE IS DECIDED. I EXPECT MARKETS WILL CREEP UP SLOWLY. YOU REAP WHAT YOU SO WITH YOUR VOTE. REMEMBER THAT WHEN 2022 ROLLS AROUND.
Another terrific day. Very impressive as this juggernaut moves on. 
Why AMD is jumping high today and $intc $nvda and $mu are red? Does anyone read any news? Upgrades? ... volume is high so this is no coincidence.
LOVE  LOVE  LOVE  That $30 intraday crash  NVDA

"so, umm....who bought 570c at the 543x lows and posted it?hello?while the chronics shriek and squeal"
Be honest long bag  holders did you ever in your wildest dreams think it was even conceivably possible that you could buy NVDA @ $589 last July almost a year ago and you see $598 this morning???
"will open the stock to people just starting to invest, hopefully for the long haul. Great company, bright future"
Yessssss NVDA R.I.P.Down $50 pre market lower than where it was over two months ago cha Ching I am rich beyond words I knew this was coming 
"look to me an increase of $100 for this week is going to happen. I sayeth yo will see $1,000 soon real soon. Thanko"
So where are the $648 buyers?
NEW ARTICLE : The Ratings Game: Nvidia stock hits record high as analysts laud plans for an Arm-based data-center CPU
Cramer really praising NVDA in the open.
Meanwhile back at the $intc and $nvda and $mu camps... red everywhere. .deep red lol nVidia's investors know their bubble is next to burst way worst than Intel's collapsing its PPS down to $100s only. Disaster is eminent. .end of Jansen bubble hype.
"I told my mom to buy this stock at 139usd a couple years ago. She knows nothing about semiconductors or GPU's, but she loves NVIDIA! Own nvidia, don't trade it. Jensen is one of the smartest person in the world"
"Nvidia back to $500 and then $400, $300.... until extinct. Dinosaur chips will soon be extinct."
"TTD was down $200 today to $485. Was $1000 recently! AND get this, they beat earnings and upped guidance AND announced a 10 for 1 split, SO if you don’t think a major NASDAQ stock can fall $200 into tax day in one day on good news THINK  AGAIN"
"Nvidia will close green, and the shorties will be pouting as they wait in line for dinner at the soup kitchen."
HERE YOU GO!!!! BUYING OPPORTUNITY ON A NASDAQ CORRECTION!START DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
Can't wait to hear Little EXTREMELYPoorAFbah tell us how rich he is. Nvda -14 and BROKU -8. Both lost double digits last week. Yup. Super rich guy. LMAO.
Less than two hours until WHAT TIME  RED! So excited  9:30  am EST is my guess! A matter of fact I say NVDA hits ZERO before $564. Anyone want to bet???
You have to know Lisa $AMD and Jensen $NVDA are in Terror awaiting the launch if Intel's Xe GPU later this year or sometime.
Prediction: this rally will continue until after earnings. it will reach ~700 in the next ten days and will pull back to 630s
"Oh hell yeah!!“While our fiscal 2022 first quarter is not yet complete, Q1 total revenue is tracking above the $5.30 billion outlook provided during our fiscal year-end earnings call. We are experiencing broad-based strength, with all our market platforms driving upside to our initial outlook,” said Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer of NVIDIA."
Anyone know what the next letter will be when she drops the T ????
smoking hot stock. leader in my portfolio
What time RED? 9:33am ESTAll the “upgrades” flow in?$800 yet?Going to $463
Think  about this stonk goes down $100 in 2 weeks $20-$30 everyday then the market finally rockets up and it goes up $3
Salamander where are you ? Did you finally go away forever and ever AMEN! Even Levin/Tevin left our abodes! If you are there then let us know . Even not then use telepathy to communicate with us . Thank you. I used to love your message of doom and gloom and hopelessness because you were so wrong. See you then on Monday
"Nicely coming back. Nvidia and the chip sector and the technology sector are all dynamos, dynamic, growth and are not replaceable with no alternative other than become a hermit and live up a mountain among the wild . Fools if you want to do that go ahead"
THAR SHE BLOWS NVDA R.I.P.  DOWN $10 and no chance of a rebound. Investors day LOL 
At $648.57 to the exact penny last Thursday (when I bought puts) I noticed 100 posts in a row here that said “we are going to $1000.” NVDA had just fallen from $615 to $463 in a week and no one was selling $648? HUH 
Told you yesterday about the march to $600did you profit off it or make senseless posts about $1000 etc ???
"Very difficult to estimate what price NVDA could be EOY. I would guess $800 without ARM and $1,000 with ARM. What do other longs think?"
"Awww... DF Messy Dummy grasping at straws yet again and cherry picking dates to try to make her self feel better about her S|-|IT stock picking ""skillz"". 9/2/20 NVDA 573.84. 5/20/21 584.94. That's a +1.9% last time I math'ed. Meanwhile Naz was 12056 back then and 13300 today, a whopping +10.3%. You get an F- in math and a Z- in debating. But I'll give you an A+ in DFing."
"Just out: ""Citi keeps Marvell as top semi equipment pick, Nvidia moves up to two"""
"Has Salamander Johnson (Kevin ) changed has handle yet? He called his $555 short this morning a ""no- brainer"". It is aptly named because only someone without brains would short at $555 and don't forget his many shorts starting at $140 --- all losers."
I'll buy back at 520 next week

"Sold the NVDA weekly calls and bought puts at the close Friday easiest money I will ever make need to profit $150,000 after taxes so like $280,000 this week to pay for my dark tan"
"Why does $nvda have to now disclose they want to design a server ARM chip ""Grace""? To compete with those other companies licensing ARM to design just that? How can regulators approve nVidia's buying ARM with such announcement? The thing is nVidia knows they won't get approval so as with any other ARM customers they try to shoft attention from the coming failure to buy ARM with a new gimmick 2 years away. Won't work. NVidia's PPS to collapse on the news ARM deal won't be approved. AMD will obviously jump to new highs. Don't be fooled the writing is on the wall. Making own chips to compete with the licensing clients is a no no."
"AMD-Xilinx are voting on their merger today, Marvell-Inphi are voting on the 15th this month. Soon it will be Nvidia-ARM. Very soon.Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
"forward pe low 30's, compare it to that of other growth stocks (eg: shop >200), I'm not even mentioning tsla."
Something fishy going on. Why announce a split before earnings ? Why not at the same time ? I think Huang is trying to protect share price before a $100 drop after earnings.
"$NFLX $WIMI $ZM $NVDA Fade out style, adhere to the configuration, play to the advantages of active management and fade out some kind of simple style selection, comprehensive judgment enterprise the present relationship between value and price, the relationship between the future growth and value, choose good enough good long-term investment of enterprise, is to be able to get beyond a certain style of ""single"" returns, and create excess returns in the long run."

WS wants to sell you overhyped NVDA $542.20 and buy all your undervalued AMD for $73. Remember AMD is the new leader in GPUs - CPUs at 7nm.
"whole market down, good opp to get in."
"""Friday's technicals, such as market breadth, volume, etc. (not to mention an important JP Morgan call) confirmed the violent move to the upside, and provides a pretty strong green light for tech stocks to rebound significantly heading into April. The highest quality leaders, the strongest growth players (NVDA, SNOW, DOCU) look poised to resume their prior uptrends"""
Another fantastic day for NVDA. No stopping this Chip King. Royalty 
I’m a long but they said $800?
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!

BUY NVIDIA WE WILL MAKE NEW ALL TIME HIGHS VERY SOON.
"with Fed pumping, this will hit $1000"
What time another new high Ya Baby !!!
How is the NASDAQ green and NVDIA down so much? Does apple drive the entire NAS? Weird NVIDA selling everything they can make and still beaten down - betting the earnings call changes all that.
"if you have been thinking about buying intel, it's down 4% on the news:Nvidia Corp. said it’s offering the company’s first server microprocessors, extending a push into Intel Corp.’s most lucrative market with a chip aimed at handling the most complicated computing work. Intel shares fell more than 2% on the news.https://fortune.com/2021/04/12/nvidia-cpu-intel-chipmaker-graphics-computer-processing/"
This will be 4 digits within the next 3-5 years easily. Hoping it dips in the short term honestly to pick up more shares
A bump in the road to $1000.
Spy can't even break this ....
"Nvidia! The name fairly dances off the tongue! Only $1 away from a new ATH and +300% gain in 2 years. Easy to be long, especially when you pick'em right!I have no expectations in either direction, and my position is very small, but what is the sentiment around a stock split for nvda? The last one was in 2007. Dividends are tiny. Is it time for increase? Does the company need the liquidity?I mostly hang out on the shopify boards, where I am vocal in speaking out against a stock split, but I don't follow this company or industry closely enough to have an opinion.Last year, 3 companies in my portfolio split, one of which was aapl. Share price has been violently sideways since the split, maybe it has finally turned around. I closed the other position about a month later, and trimmed the third one right back immediately (a REIT, now trading at post-covid 2018 prices.I think splits are an arms-length way for a company to exercise their influence over the company ""within the trading market"" (in quotes because I don't know how to properly express it), so I am also asking, Would a split be advantageous for Nvdia?"
"Cloudflare (NET) announced it is partnering with Nvidia (NVDA) to ""bring AI to the edge at scale.""

Yet. Continue to drop after hour. Why bother with the upgrade? I read all the news about this stock. All positive. Number one tech and chips. Upgrade galore. Can’t even stay put at 589 today. Down another 11 points in one hour.
I loved  when NVDA hit $650 or so last week there were 1000 posters in here I’ve never seen before probably Reddit losers saying it was going to $700. Hasn’t had an uptick since

why would anyone even think about selling this stock? Buy it and keep adding on any 5% dip day. Been doing that since it was at 30$ a share and i wont stop until i retire(10 years early )
NVDA $615 in February NVDA $635 in AprilUp 2% Yawn

Made 4.36 per share....base on buying 600 today and will keep it until a up day......know this stock well......600 is bottom. Opinion call make it to 620.....than sell (base on what happening in the market). Than sell for a small dip and make another run
"VIPUL how’s that $510 buy doing? Never lose once, huh? I begged you at $520 to cancel your $510 buy"
Guys NVDA 52 week high is $648.57. NVDA reports earnings next week and with the 4:1 stock split news coming before earnings it could easily skyrocket to $800 or even beyond. Hold and enjoy the ride!!!!
Al HUANG as a teenager before Nvidia & black leather chaps————————->

"To my $nvda and $intc AMD's bashing friends - please note Samsung’s Unpack on April 28th isn't just about the ARM based Windows laptops using AMD's rDNA 2 ARM Exynos chips. These 5nm chips will be sold to others including smartphones and tablets and laptops makers just like Qualcomm business and Mediatek. So this is more than just Laptops to complete with Apple's Macbooks. ..by Samsung only. Do your research ny friends, no hard feelings. ..good luck! Read:""Exynos Chips May Come To More Samsung & Non-Samsung Phones In 2021"" and many articles Samsung has a chips business not just devices Galaxy etc and a 5nn fab business all separate.

"Can someone please explain the net impact of the ""chip shortage"" on NVDA? The phrase ""chip shortage"" is thrown around constantly and people use it as both a bullish and bearish argument. Where is the shortage exactly? Is it an end user shortage of products that NVDA and other such companies make which would mean higher demand and upward pricing power? Or is it a shortage of semi materials that NVDA and similar companies actually use to make their products, which would make it more difficult and expensive to meet their normal demand? Thanks in advance."
Huang reminds me of the eccentric professor from Back to the Future. NVDA is one of my top 3 gainers and net holdings. I'd add if I could.
Big blocks didn’t even start yet. Friday up $40?
"If you didn't listen to the bashers on this mb and bought in the 460's recently then you made 15% on the stock alone, options a whole lot more. How much did these shorts make at the same price point? Exactly."

"Hey  everyone alert  I told you all NVDA $504 @ $614, now I am telling you $463 @ $513. Sell and short, sell calls buy puts"
AMD should say a big thank you to Nvidia for including it as part of its data center solution not that we had a choice considering Intel has basically turned into a second rate CPU company
INTC stumbles around trying to make GPU and NVDA counter punches with its own CPU. I know which horse to be on.
"yo guys (ladies too) down a little wee bit but futures ain't mean nothin more than 1.5% so don't putty strain on yo face (sweet face) buckle up and buyeth more because I sayeth with great confdience we will see $1,000 soon.

@TK12 At last in your buy range post-split. Not holding my breath to see if you put your money where your mouth is...
Nasdaq is red. Nvidia is up 2.5%. I can't wait for Monday when Nvidia will cross $650.
NVDA $300 to $150 last MarchNVDA $615 to $463 this MarchNVDA $649 to $590 and tanking in April Where is the bottom? $490 is my best guess will cover & buy some there
just a 35 forward p/e ratio... Not expensive for the smartest company in the world IMO. Nvidia will be one of the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now.
"All these warnings that have been posted and are still being unleashed made me doubt...So I checked my ""losses"" and the ""demise"" of nvidia over the past years....Oh, what a shock that was. This will be hard to digest, jon, tevin/kevin, jet911c, trapperkeeper,etc....Ouch."
You own a stonk that has 0% chance of ever going up again ever in your lives! How does that make you feel knowing that????
$700 in the near future!!
NVDA lost $40b in market cap this week Most companies take decades to get to $40b in market cap
You were fooled by hedge funds that made you believe that the sky is the limit Nvidia is going to 300$
Dude was up with all this shorts.
I set a limit buy order yesterday at 608.4. Guess my magic number didn't work out for me this time. Good luck to all longs. The hell with Charlie patron/endorser $AMD.
we will test 557. sell in may and go away
Apparently yahoo deletes when you post down $5
"NVDA hasn’t moved a penny in a year while BITCOIN went from $5000 to $65,000, BUT now that BITCOIN is down to $38,000, NVDA is suddenly tanking! I warned you all 100x about Tristan Gerra of Baird fake $800 PT"
NVDA SPLIT at 800 or 200 split adjusted and then go to 400 or 1600 split adjusted by Jan 2022
4 for 1 Ok. nice. Look at what happened to Tesla. Tesla splitted on 750 5/1. now it worth 2800. Same will happen.
"NVDA stonk has never gone up once in over 6 years (24 consecutive quarters) on earnings day. I keep a “spread sheet” in my office with every companies earnings, price, analysts EPS & revenues and actual EPS & revs, along with stonk prices before and after. 0-24!"
I was changing brokers and my account was in limbo when this 'winner' plummeted to $460 or so. Wanted so much to add substantially to this position. Still have a nice position but just wanted a bigger one. Missed that opportunity. This stock will be back above $600 in short fashion and will appreciate even more.
"Looks like could fall $20+ today just this morning. Time for the shorts to make bank. Don’t be greedy, sell & short"
NVDA “only” down $1 in after hours! Guess the $60 fall this past week on no news wasn’t enough
"Fantastic company, but this too high. A retracement to the mid $500s, at least, is inevitable. Get back in lower side of $550."
"I was long on this stock up until last week when I sold my $550 calls at around $615. I still like the company. But if you don't think that the talk of doubling the capital gains tax rate of the largest shareholders in the country doesn't potentially represent a potential sea change in the overall market, I think you're delusional. This is like the Fed going from easing to tightening, if it actually happens. It doesn't matter how much you love a stock, it's like an anchor around the whole market's neck. No one knows for certainty how things will play out or if the tax rate even changes, but to dismiss it in a matter of fact way is pretty foolish."
Anyone nibbling at selling out of money Calls? The way this thing climbing I can’t ! Premiums not bad!
9 of 10 openings look just.....like.....this!!!!!
"Along with the strong buy from outperform at Raymond James with a $750 price target, they also downgraded DarthDummy, dot-boy, and Kevin to serious psychopaths from undesirables."
Hopefully no one got faked out and sold during this mornings little tiny dip. Just keep adding shares.

NVDA was $615 the beginning of February here we are almost May and $615 LOL 
"From Barrons - News flash...Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a research note Monday that he now sees just a 10% chance that the proposed combination will be completed— down from a previous estimate of 25%.“Based on this notice, it appears that the U.K. is pushing forward with a more stringent review of antitrust issues, including potential national security concerns,” he wrote.Malik sees another complication in Nvidia’s recent announcement of plans to build an ARM-based microprocessor for data-center computers for the first time. His view is that the announcement was a positive for Nvidia but complicated the merger approval. For one thing, he wrote in a previous research note, it “shows what Nvidia can deliver with or without” a deal to actually buy Arm. And he said that the arrangement also could underline the perception that Nvidia could get more favorable treatment than other chip companies who license ARM designs.If UK does not kill the deal China will!"

Check this out... NVDA featured in a EXCLUSIVE publishment talking about a possible huge breakout https://lussosnews.com/exclusive-is-nvidia-nvda-nearing-a-massive-breakout/
"Do you guys believe in “predictive analysis “? Right now Nvidia is $364 billion dollar company. Soon you will see Nvidia as a One Thrillion Dollar Company. When I said Apple will be a Two Thrillion Dollar company I was laughed at, mocked and made fun of. Well now Apple is on its way to become a Three Thrillion Dollar Company"

NVDA best day in months only down $5 or so. Congrats 
We could reach close to $700 this week no ifs and buts about it
"looking at analysts' guidance for next year is amusing - the differential between low and high rev estimates is between $7-$8B - the differential for earnings is $3.3B. the analysts are all over the place and still having problems digesting what this company is doing. if nvda executes their plan and the ARM deal is approved, nvda could find itself in an extremely dominant position in 2024. I no longer find the ultra bulls calls for $1500 ridiculous. if the market behaves, it could happen sooner than you think. what happened to my little $15B niche graphics card company and how did the Huanger do this in 6 years? GLTA"

Look at NVDA rally today!!! GO NVDA GO!!!

"Nvidia's Grace CPU 10X more powerful that Intel's fastest x86 CPUs - Tom's Hardware LinkNvidia introduced its Arm-based Grace CPU architecture that the company will use to power two new AI supercomputers. Nvidia says its new chips deliver 10X more performance than today's fastest servers in AI and HPC workloads. The new Grace CPU architecture comes powered by unspecified ""next-generation"" Arm Neoverse CPU cores paired with LPDDR5x memory that pumps out 500 GBps of throughput, along with a 900 GBps NVLink connection to an unspecified GPU for the leading-edge devices. Nvidia also revealed a new roadmap (below) that shows a ""Grace Next"" CPU coming in 2025, along with a new ""Ampere Next Next"" GPU that will arrive in mid-2024."

Just shorted more $606 pre market! So easy yet so simple
Up 500 bucks a share in 2 yrs...
Wonder if we will test $50 after the latest news
"I like Nvidia as a company. I like their marketing, but there is a head and shoulders pattern that is real clear in the 30 min chart. Looking at historical data you can see that everytime there is a big long momentum, almost always there a really big down momentum to the down side. Check for yourself."
"""$NVDA has 608M shares outstanding. $INTC has 4.5B shares outstanding. $AMD has about 1B shares. This is also why $nvda could hit $300 while $intc will struggle to hit $60. This is why when 2H19 AMD takes the performance crown across majority platforms and solutions in the market, $AMD can also claim $100+. Ryzen is already the top 3 Amazon best selling CPUs in USA, Canada and Europe.""How many get this post when they click on conversations? NVDA now has 619M while AMD['s has blooned to 1.2M. Dilution is an ongoing issue with AMD and it has hurt their SP. By the way sands is nowhere to be found on the AMD board just like the many pumpers before and after."
A very up day in the making.

Good day NVDA. More to come with chip recover this summer.
How come Kevin didn't mention we might fall? lol Anyway just added some shares at $512.99/share. Volume is light across most semiconductor stocks including Nvidia. I'm nibbling on delicious offerings as in the price comes in again.

Why does Kevin/Tevin/Salamander keep changing his name?
"Nvidia assumed with Overweight from Sector Weight at KeyBanc KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded Nvidia to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $700 price target after assuming coverage of the name. The analyst believes Nvidia is best positioned to monetize ""one of the fastest and highest value add workloads"" in the data center, artificial intelligence and machine learning. With its scale advantage, Nvidia has the resources to build or acquire all the assets necessary to meaningfully monetize the entire data center stack including both hardware and software, Vinh tells investors in a research note. He believes the company's software is creating a ""dominant position"" in artificial intelligence."

My question is how does Tesla have that valuation verse Nvidia. Every year Nvidia develops a new TAM “total address market”. How many new business did they blow up at GTC. Smartest company in the world. I really mean that. Do u know they have the fastest and smartest super computer in the world focus on AI? Software writing software. Hum...

NVDA $589 July 2020NVDA $590 almost May 2021People don’t like #FACTSNVDA is a Ponzi
$648Fake Investor DayHUANG does it again $589 last July $590 today what’s that “return”?
where do the mature investors here realistically see nvda stock trading by earnings? I'm thinking 650s but wondering if i'm being greedy and should take profits on my 5/21 580c?
NVDA best day since raising fake guidance last Monday “only” down $20
Pay attention to the accelerated selling into the close
NVDA is nothing more than a Ponzi Scheme. Told you all at $649 and telling you again at $610.
Look Intently at these manipulations overhyped NVDA $612.36 vs Undervalued AMD $83.68. The street can play with you manipulating irrationally.
"Don't be fooled .... look at Nasdaq. .. look at $intc $mu and $nvda sinking substentially more than AMD. It's those bloated semis not AMD to sink. We're golden by merit. Technology real merits and results will prevail over transient panic, while the hype of Intel’s and nVidia's CEOs will bust sinking their bubble.This is how to make money while clueless others panic, those who know select the real bargains. It's not nVidia's nor Intel's sgares.. it's AMD!"
Intel has Tiles. Nvidia has bupkiss. Flush Nvidia.
"Remember that $nvda will dive as there's no chance regulators will approve the ARM buy. Not to mention that the UK won't give up a strategic processor ecosystem to be taken over by a US company, nor China will allow such to be under the US threat of banning ARM from Chinese companies ruin them. So nVidia's without ARM is a niche market player outsider to ecosystem owners with x86, such as AMD or even Intel. GPUs alone cannot justify a $500+ PPS.. don't be fooled, sell nVidia's buy AMD!"
All time high! Ya Thur! 
why wasn't i in this stock since march 09 generational wipeout lows that's my biggest issuegeezusi adored their products past 20+ years hello

NVDA express continues. Get on board or get run over. 
"You do realize that the entry of AMD's chips into the ARM market share using Samsung 5nm fabs is a huge event as Samsung will launch the AMD's ARM based Exynos chips next week? Huge huge event killing Apple and ... QUALCOMM! These chips will have a higher performance and lower power than Qualcomm Snapdragon and Apple's M1 ARM chips AND GPUs! Samsung will sell the chips to others. This 5nm optimized APU can have other chiplets as tge AMD's circuits were ported to Samsung’s 5nm fab - it's not easy to do from TSMC to Samsung. Different fabs taking 2 years but they've finished it.So given a huge fab capacity is needed to replace both $nvda and $intc market share. It seems AMD's Samsung fabs will make GPUs and ARM APUs and CPUs while TSMC's fab will focus on CPUs servers and retail, EPYC and Ryzen! Remember chiplets from two DIFFERENT FABS can be mixed and matched, as it's seen Global Foundries IO chiplets in 12nm used in Ryzen and EPYC with TSMC 7nm compute chiplets. So mixing Samsung and TSMC's chiplets is possible. Samsung will be first 5nm AMD's chips!"

I think we kept at this discounted price for long enough today. Let's close at $615 today in an hour.

NVDA $615 in early February NVDA $613 now Any questions

If the price of the stock is six hundred dollars at the time of the split what then is the price of the stock? How is the price determined ?
Where is the $600 crowd? Anyone remember $614 in March? Anyone get a picture

"If you think that people are selling off NVDA, you're delusional. The whole market is dropping, it isn't specific to this stock. I am neither in favor or short or long, I just want the up and down to keep swinging. The more reliable the swinging reversals, the better.I like this stock because the swings are big and the fundamentals are strong enough that I feel safe riding these swings. Between this and Tesla, I think that this has slightly better EPS fundamentals for the same swing percentages, which is awesome."

holding up well in a down market
Overreacting to news. This is a good price for a quick trade. I just bought some AH fir $592.xxWe should get a bounce back to $600 at least for a quick $8/share.
Oh forgot 3 for 1 split announced in post earnings discussion spiking it to post split it trading around and just under $300. Jmho
My beloved AMD up again anyone buy at $70 recently it’s $86 and will be way over $100 come earnings
Looking up on yahoo finance I see at least four articles “buy into the chip sector “ “buy these 5 stocks in the chip sector and Nvidia is one of them . Then “chip sector ready to rebound sharply “. Then “chip sector is so profitable both top line and bottom line”. So our motto should be to buy and hold and hold and buy for the long run . Feel very sorry for the innocent God’s angels who sold listening to nonsense statements from rubbish people.
NVDA R.I.P. going back to $463 
It you watched the presentation Arm Holdings is pretty much NVDA’s de facto partner whether they end up buying AH or not. They’ve teamed up together on mega deals with Amazon and also Marvel. So Jensen isn’t sitting there like a stuffed dog hoping the deal closes. It’s full steam ahead! The man is pure genius

"I think it is fair to say that we longs are the warriors. We have our beliefs and we convey that message namely that Nvidia is a fantastic company and it will rise to reflect that fantastic(ness).

He is even better than the three stooges, Laurel and Hardy combined. Probably Gracho Max? Anyway see you guys at $1,000 soon . Many Thanks"
I am imploring you to SHORT $595 here you all know it’s going DEEP IN DA RED! Anyone here like $649 last week or maybe $549 today?

Wasn’t it just one week ago NVDA made 10 announcements during their fake INVESTORS DAY and the stock rose to nearly $650? How quick times have changed!

Undervalued AMD revenues for 2021 could be greater than overhyped Nvidia. So AMD stock price could reach $300 - $425 with superiority of products at 7nm over competition ?
Thank god for Nvidia's great diversification; no matter what happens with ARM it's doing fantastic right now and throughout 2021.
Intel tabulated 74% faster AI performance with the new chips over the prior generation. The company boasted up to 1.5 times higher performance across 20 well-known AI workloads when compared to AMD EPYC7763 and up to 1.3 times higher performance versus the Nvidia A100 GPU.

such a beast! Nvidia will be one of the biggest companies in the world 10 years from now.
NVDA was $615 in early February then went to $463. So two months later it’s $648 last week going to $400

Just put in my good to cancel order in to cover $457.50 NVDA by May just watch how simple
Hey  FreeDUMB you like NVDA last July @ $589 or 10 months later May 2021 $589? Which one?
No volume. Upgrades will be coming the next 2 weeks. They can't keep this down forever. We went from 460 to 640 in a heartbeat a few weeks ago. That's approx. +40%
"Lol. Up $9 pre market, will close down $5"
Head fake... Expect 640 by 3 PM is my opinion...
NVDA $560 tomorrow after INTC crashing and SWKS getting into the AI automotive business R.I.P. NVDA down $100 this week and counting

This was the catalyst I was looking for. Wasn't expecting it this soon but I'll take it. Buying as much as I can next week. Goal is 1250 shares after the split. Split still needs to be voted on and approved from what I saw in the news? Anyone have the over under on how likely it is to get approved?
NVDA on deck tomorrow after close of regular trading. Will be interesting.
"Market will rise today sharply because (1) month end contribution from 401k/403b/IRA/Pension Funds/Deferred Compensation etc will be you invested in the market (2) over 90% who have declared their quarterly results have met or beat expectations with mostly beating expectations (3) interest rate low (4) no inflation (5) great GDP growth (6) according to Fidelity new accounts opened are up by 19% (7)new taxes will be hard to implement. Even Ds such Mitchin is opposing it and (8)and as has been the norm , the Ds are going to lose the house in 2022. Even right now it is 218 to 212 and 5 vacant or independent. So even if there is a tax increase it will be minimum"
Way overbought..wait for pullback if you’re wise
These market conditions will prevent this from going substantially higher for a while. It's around the same price as a year ago and after 3 blowout earnings it's still trading sideways. A 4th blowout earnings won't matter in these conditions. Until there's some market catalyst for growth we won't see any drastic price bumps. I'm guessing market conditions get a lot worse before they get better which means it will probably be years before this boosts up to meet the new price targets. I'm holding long term and will probably be muted by those who are detached from reality but I'm realistic.

In the short-term, Caso thinks results will be more dependent on supply than demand given widespread shortages, and thinks improvement in enterprise, driven by a return to the office as well as the A10 launch, could drive better Datacenter growth in 2H, the analyst tells investors in a research note. In the long-term, Caso says Nvidia's success in AI has earned them a permanent seat at the table in both hyperscale and enterprise compute."

nvda 5/21 570cfrom 1.00to 18 peak todaynailed that trade to the wall
Hahahahhaha @ KEVIN . Love it
Sold my measley 59 shares today . Makes me sad bc I love NVDA and been holding since $455 last July. Held at $149 to $375 before that. I have no doubt in NVDA but I don’t trust this market stability much less our uhh uh uh president. GLTA
Remember $intc and $nvda sink for a reason unrelated to AMD. But 81m short positions and flood of the Crew aggressively paid bashers posting is a reason. Don't be fooled AMD will rise!
"While the TSMC's 2021 yearly outlook raise suggests chips are doing well, and semis rise, don't be confused by this to think $nvda and $intc will equally benefit this year as AMD. They won't. AMD will rise with huge margins, especially as Intel's guided 2021 outlook to be lower revenues than 2020 citing PCs market decline, which isn't true as we've seen both IDC and other research firms, are seeing big growth. Net is AMD is set to significantly gain in 2021 with high revenues and profits leading to high record breaking SP. Other semis will decline as they are way over bought."
"Broke 600, charge forward."
650 after hrs.
See how $nvda is red and AMD is green in premarket? Don't hold a bubble $400B market cap nVidia. It's a trap for retail investors while institutions selling you an empyy bag.

Continuous improvements to the future shows favorable indication that eventually it will go into green zone . Besides futures are just 1.5% of the entire daily activity. Does not really mean much
So let me see if I have this right: EVERYONE IN HERE “BOUGHT MORE TODAY?” Hmm  know what that means? Going much lower!

"Adding some for the last time today. Nasdaq chart clearly shows a soft landing and 90% of tech was reporting better numbers than expected.

"""If there is any generalization to make about Nvidia as a company, it is that since its humble beginning in gaming graphics it has had an almost supernatural ability to be years ahead with emerging technologies, giving it a leadership edge when it finally hits mainstream."""
"easy $600B company, addressable mkt in autonomous driving, ev, data centers crypto and on and on...."
Remember there were exactly similar concerns back in March. Some risk has already been taken off the table. After that NVDA announced blow out report and stock hit ATH and got PT upgrades. Just a hunch but very unlikely it sees March lows. I am not selling.
a $600B company at a deep discount!
intel 20% decline in key data center revenuei wonder who stole that market share?
I don’t usually care about stock splits but now my basis will be less than $5/sh. I would not mind another 5 for 1 so I can say I bought NVDA for under a buck.
Remember that the huge $intc market share revenues shifting to AMD is tied to not just TSMC benefiting. Global Foundries and Samsung all will be needed to fab chips for AMD to replace Intel's and $nvda chips PLUS ARM based new TAMs to take over Qualcomm! In addition to $xlnx NEW JOINT products way more than their current revenues. Do you understand what is being unfolded in front of us now? Intel is just the beginning.
"NVDA short interest  51% in 15 days right before earnings. Hmm  think someone knows something? NVDA @ $612 is the largest short position (naked short, sold calls, own puts) I have ever had ever in 30+ years of trading every day."

If we look back to 9/15, Nvda is a measly 2622% while Amd is +4182%. Don't you also like how she keeps ignoring the fact that Nvda is almost 0% going back to 9/2? DF Messy Dummy has never been one for telling the truth!"
Part of the $INTC punishment is because Pat Gelsinger thought he can lobby for $INTC to be handed monopoly for $INTC on US Soil ... bet he soiled himself ... when he was reminded that $TSMC and $NVDA and $AMD will not let it be...
stay away from trash stock NVDA==its a wealth destroyer in next 2 years!
"NVDA will be $800+ MINIMUM by the end of the year. Upside is $1,100. Everything else is just noise. Buy and hold and you will be rich!"
"There are literally Twitch and Youtube channels dedicated to bots looking worldwide to getting an Nvidia GPU. Every single thing produced is sold in microseconds. Ethereum has doubled or trippled the value of Nvidia gpus. The only limitation on Nvidia's profits is factory capacity, that's it."
The best part of the recent price action is that AMD has COMPLETELY under performed NVDA in every way.
Does $nvda still drop after earnings even though the split news is out there now? Lately when companies crush earnings the stock drops. Bizarre market these days.
"HBO’s Bill Maher says Portland police departures are ‘a cautionary tale’By Kristi Turnquist | The Oregonian/OregonLiveIn his latest comments on Portland, HBO’s Bill Maher touched on the topic of police, and referred to the departure of Portland police officers as “a cautionary tale,” warning, “We do not want to live in a world without police. Then it’s ‘The Purge’ every night.”During the most recent episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher,” the host said he was heartened to see members of law enforcement testify in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, and be willing to criticize Chauvin for kneeling on the neck of the late George Floyd for more than nine minutes. Maher was encouraged, he said, to see police “finally testifying against their own.”Maher then brought up Portland, where he said there was an “exodus” of police. “I mean, if you’re one of those people who wants antifa to get results, you win....It may not be the one you want. But 115 police officers have left” in Portland, Maher went on to say. “That’s a lot, in a city that size.”As The Oregonian/OregonLive has reported, “Since July 1, 115 officers have left the Police Bureau, including 74 who retired and 41 who resigned. Two more will resign by the end of this month and one more is retiring. They make up one of the biggest waves of departures in recent memory.”In the Oregonian/OregonLive story, some portions of police exit interviews are quoted. Maher was apparently referring to that report when he said that in Portland, “one retired detective said, ‘The community shows zero support. The mayor and the council ignore actual facts on crime.”Maher then said, “Portland, it’s a cautionary tale,” adding, “‘Cause we do not want to live in a world without police. Then it’s ‘The Purge’ every night,” alluding to the horror franchise in which, for a time, crime is legal."
"NVDA is over extended, and going to reality. I see it heading back down to 400s."

Didn't expect that end!
I think Nvidia did well today . It held firmly and pushed back and tried to push up. Tomorrow will be a glorious day .
The new leader undervalued AMD $80.17 or Nvidia $611.49 working on a chip to compete with Intel antique products in 3years?

NVDA was $589 last July 2020 and NVDA is $575 now! ANYONE inner loin $597 on Friday? I am up 1000% on my weekly puts
"Intel beat, raised forecast but data center sales were lower. We all know who's gonna take market share from now on. Well not everyone I guess, lol."
$700. by Friday would be very fair.
It’s turnaround time. It will end higher today.
almost all time high
Looks like the hourly chart is making a nice cup and handle pattern. A breakout through 541 would have an upside projection near the old high.
No news from Salamander Johnson. Probably a sabbatical day hence no communication. Also Tevin etc also  disappeared which tells me they are all one
$606 short cha Ching so easy NVDA R.I.P.
Nvidia management just came out with a new commercial on tv  their slogan is: “DOWN $20 A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY.”
Holding at the markers.
Way overbought...wait for pullback if you’re smart..realistically a 500 stock at most..
Is NVDA still over $592 after the fake $800 PT upgrade that no one fell for????
"Gaming. Space, EV’s, Data Centers, Crypto Mining. AI ..........A literal whose who of the hottest sectors. Hard to find a company more strategically placed in all those sectors ..... because there isn’t. "

Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
Just like AAPL and AMD. When this reports ANOTHER hard cliff dive. Eat it BWAHAHAHA
Is NVDA up over $20 today like you all said? Just curious?
"As expected, another day another gain as NVDA rebounds from the flash correction."
Down $50 today TOLD YA!!!!! ROTFLMFAO  $615 to $463$649 to $569 and falling to where? $300? $200?

could end higher by $72 for the week. Think about how easy that is . Almost like a low hanging fruit. WOW! It is insane to think otherwise via via technology specially the chip sector. There is no other investing opportunity in 100 years or more than the technology and the chip sector. Just think about what I just said and yo will come up with the same answer. Thanko

When NVDA hit $650 the short interest went from 6m shares to more than 9m shares up 51% and NVDA hasn’t had an “uptick” since! Someone somewhere knew something R.I.P.
Do you know that Intel has 70% of the graphics market share. They only have to get another 10% to 80% to put Nvidia out of business.

"JP Morgan is going to start an ETF that is 15% NVDA (I found that 15% figure in another, related article):https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/03/20427251/goldman-sachs-to-offer-full-spectrum-of-investments-in-cryptocurrencies"
"Who on this board wishes if they get only their money back, they will never invest in NVDA ever again ?"
Oh happy day!
Who is buying the deeeeeeeeep ? I think my $519 buy order will be filled by Friday.
"Please remember I was amongst the first to state in a clear, concise, precise fashion that Nvidia is headed to $1,000 Please don’t make a habit of taking away credits from me. Once it reaches $1,000 please don’t applaud each other and ignore me because once we reach $1,000 I will make another prediction which will be much much higher than $1,000. Thank you"
"Told you NVDA shorts and bears that you're committing suicide. First service microprocessors, many more exciting things to come. This company will eventually reach 700. In for the long haul since $63 a share, haven't sold one share."
"Hehehehe check $nvda $intc $mu all deep red, AMD's deep green ... hehehe one semi to rule them all !"
#FACTS NVDA was $615 at the beginning of the quarter $615 now yawn 
"So add Space to Data Centers, crypto mining, gaming, EV’s, AI ...... the story keeps getting better with Arm Holdings the cherry on top "
1000 after earnings
at the day highs on another big volume day...this Train isn't stopping anytime soon...
But they said $800 PT 
Up day today
Earnings Baby  
Anyone heed my advice INNER LOIN $597 short on Friday? Put options weeklys up 1000%
TSLA went up over 400$ with in 5 months after it actually split.
Anyone listen to my INNER LOIN $617 short this morning? Up 1000% so far on my weekly puts.
This needs to be investigated.
Now Dottie is off to Fantasy Island!
Never forget we had a pps boost because of all the GTC announcements and related upgrades (and news between the lines that nvidia will beat). This is just another occasion to make your position stronger.
But guys!!! The analyst said 800 :((
Lot of Nasdaq based stocks rocketing to the sky . FB up 1.45%
Last time NVDA $614 in February RIGHT TO $463.Looksie  at the price now! UH OH 
"Anyone check the July 2020 High? It’s easy, right here on the app two tabs right of conversation. $430/sh $424/sh close.Just a FYI."
Nvda likely to turn green today before closing. Results are coming in 9 days and it will be very promising quarter.
when 80% of homeless now collect ssi/ssdi when they have severe drug/alcohol addictions and their lives have spun completely out of control that's not helping homeless that's enabling the homeless to further destroy their livesask any experienced street level drug counselor what is the most important thing to do when a person's drug/alcohol addictions have spun out of controlcut off the moneywhat do you think street level drug/alcohol addicts will do with monthly checks with no oversight whatsoever? then people wonder why there is an explosion of street homeless in downtowns across america hello?
When will nvidia split the stocksMaking it cheaper to buy
$800 price target is huge....
Exactly what big tech needed!!! A huge miss on April jobs report!
"Would you increase your number of shares at this price? Yes thumbs up, no thumbs fown"
Feeling a 40+ day coming up soon

"I am a former show off arrogant short. I was a real #$%$ and I lost and lost and lost. I almost lost my spouse too on account of my tradings. Now for the lady 15/16 years I buy and hold and hold and buy and I also buy some great mutual funds besides my core individual holdings. And I am happy. I am beginning to look ? younger , I smile more, I laugh more . The brokers and analysts are just for themselves. They are not concerned about you and me."
Went down $10 on Friday $10 end of the day Thursday $10+ now LOL 
NVDA will trade $447 before $500Save this brilliance and trade accordingly
"played out today just about exactly the way i wanted it big opening move higher mid-day mild pullback/consolidation and then, the ramp into closegood stuff"
NVDA $589 last JulyNVDA $589 now #FACTS
Fantastic finish buying right into the close. Investors couldn’t get enough of NVDA buying with both hands. The fact that the UK is doing a perfunctory security risk check as part of it’s due diligence in lieu of gaining approval is not really news. It would be more news and negligent if they didn’t. Savvy Investors realize this and happily bought cheap shares from the weak hands as per usual. On to $700 compadres. 
How many days shorties can afford to short this stonk. It deserves $700
It is hoped that it will cross $600 by the end of the day today.
You never see those badmouthers when it's up...Oh btw still 80% higher today than it was at its 52 week low. Not complaining here and more to come.
WOW! Messy Dummy is being super pissy today... you'd think she'd be happy on this gorgeous day??? Maybe it has to do with the 0% gain in 8 months? While Naz is up 12% in the same time frame? Or maybe she's mad that BA is up 50% in that timeframe? I'd be pissy too if I always picked the wrong stocks.
yo guys I aint worried a wee bit. Kappot the whole market is down but we shall haveit a great May the year of our Lord 2021. Yes siri bob don't strain your cheeks with stress marks. Haveth faith fellas. Best country in the world. Best and largest economy in the world. Best and largest market in the world. and look at how we recovered and GDP up 6.7% and the results from companies greatly great for the quarter and folks working and buying things and what not. Don't worry keep yo chin up. Thanko
Anyone want to start the $463 chant with me? Come on stand up stand tall be proud  & loud $463 FOUR SIXTY THREE. Come on now TARDS & PUKES 
"its pretty much evident the arm deal isn't going through at this point. every major country is opposed to it, and even the US, Nvidia's home turf, is opening an investigation. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/korea-to-intervene-in-nvidia-arm-merger-process-10040348?utm_source=reddit.comThe Qualcomm, Broadcom merger never went through, what makes you think arm, the world's future answer to cloud computing is going to be handed over to America. A country that cut off the supply of chips and operating systems to china. Seems pretty bleak to me, given Europe is trying to become a tech hub of their own. funny enough, Nvidia denied the Uk's request to retain 4000 arm employees in the country had the deal gone through. a month later they opened an inquiry. They should of just said yes and chugged along"
"Just another day of ""shorts taking our money"". No seriously: something's up. Best stock on my watchlist."
$666 next rest stop
"serious question, looking for a broad range of opinions...i bought this back at 125 sold it at 350 for a solid profit...now seeing this company dominate every aspect of the industry, is this still a buy all the way up here or are most waiting for a pullback?"
NVDA will be “down $20” by the close Please trade accordingly
NVDA will be down $20+ tomorrow. Anyone want to wager? Come on big shots. Any amount
$615 come monday after the presentation. $650 by quarter end.
ARM BABY!!! 
Slowly slowly everything is turning towards positivity and we will see green soon too. Just hold and buy more
"The whole future market is down. But futures are only 1.5% of the market, I have seen this happen before and the market almost always certainly rebounded (rebounds) sharply and by God this time it will too"
NVDA will be down $50 today to $520 or below or I never post again save this brilliance
I said down $30 today or I won’t ever post again there is $10 another $20 coming
Think they would have gotten more mileage on this if they let the stock rise into earnings and then announce the split post earnings. We were already getting the pre earnings run.
"Sell ? Go short? Are you out of your banana republic mind? Or are you just rotten to the core selfish, treacherous and conceded and whatever you can add to highlight yourself and your great (so called great) achievement. Now bend down and give me 50. If you take a break and or complain I will make you start all over again and this time it will be 100 push-ups"
I feel sorry for those shorties....NOT. They have been warned for months. Like kids that won't listen.
Looking like the ARM acquisition is going the JEDI route and may be held up for years.
And. ..AMD deep green $nvda and $intc deep red.Do you understand? Markets red....
Turnaround about to commence. The first hour impact has been absorbed successfully and now the pushback and push-up (upwards) begins p.s. if I did not believe in what I say honestly I would not be saying it.
"5+ YEARS OUTLOOK! I see $intc restructure its business to focus on fab manufacturing only, in the USA and Western countries like EU, Israel etc with significant Gov funding for independence of chips manufacturing national security goals vs relying on Taiwan and South Korea. Intel will sell its x86 franchise to probably nVidia as so $nvda won't buy ARM nor will it be approved as it's a UK national security and China too especially with China ARM CEO lawsuit going on. But in the next few years, AMD will rise especially as tge Xilinx merger get AMD to become the dominant chips supplier of the world. AMD's ARM architecture license allows them to make own designs compatible with ARM and Samsung has the financial muscles and fabs to fabricate such chips. AMD will grow significantly, render ARM licensing business mostly obsolete as their chips will have an intermix ECOSYSTEM of x86 pin compatible sockets, servers, mobile, laptops, PCs and added GPUs, FPGAs and other heterogeneous accelerators. Won't make sense for any company to do their own, even Amazon and Apple! So in the next 5 years, AMD is the stocks to hold all the way to $1000 SP. After many turbulences for Intel and nVidia, with significant SP decline, they could be a buy 5 years from now. If th above happens...Intel will be a pure fab manufacturing company at bigger size than TSMC after 5 years without own chips designs. While nVidia's only chance is to buy Intel's chips designs businesses, Mobileye, Altera FPGAs, x86 desigs to survive vs AMD. Intel's Flash storage will be sold to other company, it's different business than computing. Hence Bob Swan ex Intel's CEO, to stop Intel's dependency on x86, is the begining of the above long transformation, new CEO is executing with $20B fab investment, collaboration with IBM on fab technology, and starting an open fab business."
Who would like NVDA at $600 ? You could have switched NVDA to LRCX and boom...$600. Equipment makers will outperform chip companies.
Lot of call options sold for $580 strike seem to have been bought today. We should expect 580-590 tomorrow?
$615 February 1$589 July of 2020$611 May 2021LOL 
A true shorters paradise
So...up from $540 to almost $600 on no news...hmmm...me thinks someone got a hold of the earnings report lol. Glad I bought the dips! Good luck longs.

Did any of you vote? I did but can anyone please tell me what this means. 4. Approval of an amendment to our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 2 billion shares to 4 billion shares.
Just bought lot more. You can also buy FSELX (Fidelity semiconductors) if you need the total sector benefits. FSELX has Nvidia as a major holding holding. Other family of funds may also have a semiconductor mutual funds for your consideration
Will be “down $50” tomorrow again on no news  PLEASE TRADE ACCORDINGLY
It's obvious that we'll recover when the nasdaq does. Everytime the nasdaq tanks nvidia goes down simultaneously. Same goes for all chips today. Which is odd given the fact that demand hasn't been as high in a decade.

"“The takeaway is that Nvidia is serious about CPUs and will not be constrained by X86 owned by Intel and AMD,” Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in a research note. “The level of platform innovation is mind boggling and something that silicon competitors will be tasked to match for many, many years to come.”"

"A hefty price is justifiedIf we had to choose one chip designer without looking at the price, it would be this company without a doubt. Both the operational qualities and the positioning are so strong that a hefty price can be paid for this.We therefore maintain the Buy advisory as well as the $ 600 price target, noting that market sentiment in the chip sector is equally bad right now. Smart investors let the price rage for a while before taking a position. The chip sector is the spearhead of the economy. The fact that prices are now coming down hard there is therefore somewhat worrying, but it has also gone very fast and there is not enough reason to believe that the party on the stock markets is over."

"$nvda has just announced a new GAMING ARM for Nintendo Switch to replace the aging Tegra.

"Nvidia split its stock four times between 2000 and 2007, but never as large as the 4-to-1 split proposed Friday; the other splits were 2-to-1 in 2000, 2001 and 2006, and 3-to-2 in 2007. Since that last split, Nvidia shares have increased 1,640.7%; in the same period, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.07% has increased 183% on a price-return basis, according to Dow Jones Market Data group."
$amd red $nvda greenas it should be
Fantastic finish for NVDA. Still with the wind at our sails and a straight shot to $600. Lot of momentum on our side. 
NVDA is done $589 to $610 here since last July it’s going much lower sell now short it buy put options and sell calls RETIRE RICH
"Tax hike news hit yet? Doesn't seem like it. Even if the taxes on the wealthy and LLCs were at 100% year-over-year it would only pay for a small fraction of the first stimulus package, let alone the second or third. I'm guessing everyone else is getting their taxes jacked up next once they realize tax revenues aren't cutting it. I don't mind paying a bit more in taxes if it means good (well thought out) social programs but I have a feeling it's just going to end up looking like California where the taxes are through the roof but everything is still out of control."

I have a good track record doing so, but I don?t see a big pop coming this week. We?re probably in for another drop tomorrow, with a slight rise on Friday. Earnings will be stellar, but history shows this stock doesn?t react well to earnings - initially. However, I think we going to see a rise into June continuing into July. $600 will be back, but not as soon as I would wish. But it is coming. Keep your powder dry, add during drops, and be patient. That?s what I?m doing. Bitcoin drop is keeping markets edgy. Once that stabilizes, the tide will rise for all stocks."

Anyone here feel HUANG’ED again at $650? Last Monday LOL was the fake hype machine in order for insiders to sell
NVDA has nowhere to go but down. NVDA is like the Yankees. Lose everyday no matter how much people think  they will win! R.I.P. NVDA
Anyone INNER LOIN $559 today? Me too made 1000% on put options $563 to $538 like clockwork LOL almost 7% intraday so simple yet so easy
NVDA 1000 by January regardless of the market
And the opening bell short
"Almost every tech company is beating expectations, no worries. Just imagine what will happen when everything will go back to normal while the economy picks up steam. Well duh."
I can see Intel buying Nvidia now wouldn't that be a good problem
BK says it is a buy!

Looks like Missy LITTLE DOTTIE is getting PISSY! Guess She didn’t enjoy Her Tube Steak and BOXED Mac & Cheese Dinner!
was a good day to short $NVDA I wonder who did?$AMD $INTC
“She” looks so good  “IN DA RED ” DOESN’T “SHE”?
Watch 60 minutes right now. Talks about the chip industry. Big rebound tomorrow
"Short term, I'm waiting like everyone else to get in cheaper. I'm not (nor do I ever) fight the market trend. To be clear, I think its silly the usual sell off especially after earnings but I have been taking advantage of it for years. Good Luck longs!"
"congrats to those who bought sub 500 a few weeks back. After selling at 610 several weeks back, I'm just happy to be back above my 590 rebuy."
Fantastic Day in all respects. This is a stock that’s on the launching pad about to soar. $700 should be breached in conjunction with ER this coming week. Great to be a NVDA shareholder. 
"Having escaped the very lowest depths of a crazed episode of depression and now rising to the mania, I can tell all of you (with all clarity) that this split is NOT a positive for the stock. Look at what has happened to AAPL and TSLA since theirs this past year. BOTH stocks have done little to nothing. You'll get a short term pop from retail FOMO and then the weasels will close in and start selling, there will be unrelenting shorting. Retail will have sideways, at best, action but most likely downward pressure given logistical problems in the supply chain and the continued rotation into value as well as the perpetual fear mongering around inflation and rates. Make no mistake, I love NVDA and have it as my third largest tech holding but buying into the split is a mistake. The play is ""sell"" and trade options around it."
Red taking over $intc and $nvda - no hope after today's ER as AMD is green even under the 10AM shorts dumping attack and markets red !
What chip shortage? everyone that needs a chip has one.
Report from Charles Schwab. They did a sampling of 500 accounts found out 15% had recently opened accounts with Charles Schwab. The momentum has not slowed down . It opened 3.2 million new accounts during the first quarter of 2021.Fidelity has also reported a 19% increase in new accounts openings .All that money coming into the market. Something to think about
NVDA sold today from 494. Charts are not good for now.
Isn’t it too expensive now?
"Nvidia releases new wave of GeForce RTX laptops 07:28 NVDA NVIDIA announced a new wave of GeForce RTX laptops, delivering real-time ray tracing and AI-based DLSS, starting at just $799. ""The platforms bring NVIDIA's Ampere architecture with dedicated RT and Tensor Cores to the most mainstream audience yet, and expand the number of RTX 30 Series laptops to more than 140. Providing exceptional performance in thin, sleek designs, the new RTX laptops are twice as fast as previous-generation systems, delivering smooth, 60 frames per second gameplay at 1080p in popular titles such as Minecraft RTX and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,"" the company said."
They say Nvidias CEO is like a modern Einstein
It seems like Yesterday that We were in the $150’s and it’s been A Beautiful Run since 2019........ Chips will Continue to be needed and CONGRATULATIONS LONG$!!!
"Bloomberg report says Bitcoin will hit $400K in 2021 - Any thoughts ? One analyst at Bloomberg believes Bitcoin is on its way to become a “global digital reserve asset” for investors escaping from inflation. As shown in the chart, Bitcoin could reach a price of over $400,000 by 2021 considering price behavior in the past. BTC is transitioning from a mere speculative asset into a store of value, as investors are considering adding it to their portfolios. This institutional interest in Bitcoin could mean a “maturation leap” for the cryptocurrency, according to McGlone."

"Anyone in here like this stock by the name of Nvidia, I never heard of it before today when I bought a new PC today with a Nvidia graphics card. I see it was $648.xx last week and fell $90 practically overnight, much like the $160 fall last month from $615 to $463. Anyone think it’s a buy after the fake upgrade PT $800 in after hours or just short the open again?"

Hey  longs NVDA only down $20 still from yesterday at noon

"Definitely headed to $1,000 . I think it may split soon or it is setting up new facilities to increase production. Whichever way  WOW!"
"Tech will continue to create new markets and opportunities through innovation that you're not going to get from commodities or cyclicals. With economic growth comes consumer confidence, which means strong earnings. Dips are buying opportunities."
"Forward, march! This is THE time, people. Get on board if you are not already. NVDA has the chance of dominating 21st-century tech."
Once again you can’t think of the Future without Nvidia! Those who Short looking at nickels vs those who are invested patiently waiting for dollars! 
"Nvidia says its next-generation BlueField SmartNIC device, launched today, will deliver the most powerful software-defined networking, storage and cybersecurity acceleration capabilities for data centres. https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/04/12/nvidia-bluefield-3-smartnic/"
At $648+ I knew the end was real near when I read 1000 straight posts from new names that NVDA was “going to $700.” How did that work out?
"In the meantime, $intc deep red going deeper markets red, $nvda and $mu going red... AMD resuming deep green."
NVDA $615 in February 2021NVDA $615 end of April 2021Any questions?
GTC next week!!!!! That is always a good time for the stock.

liking this finally hoping for a standard 3 day expansion move
Now the question is will it go below $560 - and how much below. Had a nice short ride today and looking for the-entry. Still holding long in one account at $600
Next bubble burst after $imtc is the bloated $nvda ... pain there will be worst next month as their ER warns including no ARM deal approval PLUS AMD's first 5nm ARM laptop APU is unpack next week by Samsung in their Exynos! NVidia's longs should see $intc collapse and save themselves. AMD is set to move way higher.Remember this warning. ..
Has anyone seen Tevin aka Kevin aka Jon aka John aka etc today ? I needed a good laugh  and Tevin provides at least a chuckle to my life and now he is gone! Rest in Piece chuckles . Rest in Piece.

Thumbs up if you think we'll have pt upgrades tomorrow.
If the ARM deal gets approved....I become a long
"I googled and it says ""only congress can make changes to the law to increase taxes"". Second one says ""proposal to increase taxes originates in the House of Representatives "", which also implies it has to be approved by both the Houses and then signed into law. As of now it is very hard that that will happen because the Senate is Split and the House is just slightly above for the Democrats vs. the Republicians . Very hard to achieve."
$666 on the call. booyaaa
$589 tomorrow is a lock  Trade accordingly NVDA is such a mess Insiders ATM
"I love Shopify but I've been saying for ever and a day that we need a stock split. Apple, Tesla and now $NVDA announced a 4:1 split today. Their current price is $600 with a marketcap twice of Shopify's. I'll say it again for the record. Shopify needs a split."

you can always tell with comments when people lost money on a stock
Nvidia mounted a counter strike. It is already in an upward momentum and the thrust is so good  and the motions are out of this world and the screaming from Tevin is deafening. My take it will rise up big and hard tomorrow. All of us should enjoy  the ride upwards

"Not that it matters to me but Cramer says he likes quite a few semis (nvda,mrvl,amd,amat...). He said sell tech a week ago. Told you so."
NVDA from $576+ yesterday at noon to $538 pre market down $40 and all the loser longs are so happy  it’s “only” down a few bucks 
Hey NVDA longs: Remember $589 last July 2020? Only 3 months from July again. Nice “investment”.

I said yesterday NVDA would be down $50 today on no news. We are only down $30 now! Short away
I see 700 in the next 30 days... everything else is a buying opportunity...
NVDA 555 is my #1 short ever in 30 years of trading every day
$567 ......huanged again . Don’t worry board. The dbag twins jeffyG and mario the toolbag will tell you they added again
Definitely up by $+100 this week.Quarterly results will be outstanding
"https://youtu.be/hzfN-E5k5W0. Wow this is a great video on arm v9 architecture that just launched. One of the interesting facts is it took 27 years to have arm architecture in a 100 billion chips. They are estimating that in 5 years they will be in another 100 billion chips. WOW That is incredible and semi’s are the new oil. Everything runs on them. Personally, I’m way over exposed in semi’s with Nvidia, fidelity semiconductor funds and other tech funds. I’m not all in but darn close to betting the house on this trend for the next decade. Cheers"
The most PERFECT  DTF (DOUBLE TOP  FORMATION) I have ever seen in my 30 years of trading NVDA  $614! Act accordingly a gift  from God
"Back to $500, and then to $400, then to $300, then to $200....Nvidia chips are dinosaurs soon to be extinct."
NVDA stock split will happen 52 years to the day when man first stepped on the moon. NVDA is and will be the technology and AI of the future. This is really something special and this company is going to generously reward all those that purchase its stock!!

Just $6 more and NVDA will be where it was early February and $589 was where it was last July almost a year ago ZERO GAIN #FACTS

Relax longs - Jensen and ER will get us into the high 600s - My opinions.
"Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $700 from $620 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst notes that in conjunction with GTC 2021 and Keynote from CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia hosted an Investor Day. While Pitzer expects the current Semi Cycle to last well into 2022, peak year-over-year Unit growth in June will likely favor secular over cyclical in the second half of the year and views Nvidia as the best structural play in Semis."
"1000$ next week, 2000 next year."
very up day today
What's happened to the 10AM MMs manipulation? LOL not today? Why? What is special today? Why AMD gaining much more than $nvda $intc and $mu ? What happened? ??
Solid earnings plus a split. Should be good.
"The Competition and Markets Authority has been instructed to compile a report for Dowden on the competition and national security aspects of the deal before July 30. Dowden could then approve the deal, permit it on certain conditions, or ask for a more detailed inquiry. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/nvidia-takeover-of-arm-faces-uk-government-intervention.html"
Feel sorry for the faint hearted people who sold this morning. Just go back and rebuy again
"Here’s a little info for you folks that think the vote for AUTHORIZATION of common share increase means a split is imminent. In 2002, the authorized shares were increased from 500M to 1B. The next split occurred in 2006. In 2008, the authorized shares were increased from 1B to 2B. The next split occurred … NEVER. Now, could a split occur? Certainly. I have vehemently denied that one would occur all the way up through the increase in share price to $500. I could see one in the future, even though I don’t want it and don’t feel it’s needed at this point. The authorization gives NVDA the freedom to do several things with the shares down the road, but to think it means an immediate change is coming is simply unfounded. Those concerned about dilution are even dumber than those infatuated with a split. What has NVIDIA ever done that would give one concern about share dilution? The correct answer is NOTHING."
longs great days ahead
Market was up but nvidia was down but I am very confident great days ahead. I ain't worried none what soever kappot.
Anyone think NVDA will invest in boosting production capacity like TSM did?
Ya all know it’s coming and there is absolutely nothing in the world  that you can do about it WHAT TIME DEEP RED 
This stock is grossly undervalued. This will be a $750 stock by labor day. Get in and stay in.
Why are so many people so obsessed over stock splits?
Awww.... poor Messy Tummy -100 drop... gloats PM on a +12 and instantly sends the stock nose diving to a +6. Classic Messy Tummy... Ooops... there goes +6... +5 now.... AWESOME. Guess DF Messy Tummy is going back into hiding? THAT WAS QUICK.
"Reminder overhyped NVDA $619.04 vs Undervalued AMD $80.58, The merger AMD + XLNX Will have more sales than NVDA $.619.04"

You saps will never learn
Buy at peak! Sure
Don't be fooled. .. $nvda has NOTHING TO DO WITH TSMC'S GUIDANCE as I've posted in details. They are to use Samsung and TSMC's fab investment isn't for smartphones nor nVidia's chips it's HPC for AMD! I'm expecting nVidia's SP to collapse big!

OK  here we go $640 short now sell away to your hearts  content a gift from god
100% eps gain compared to last year's same period won't be too far fetched imo.
Anyone here old enough to remember when NVDA had a $400b market cap? LOL  bubble pops

"@VIPUL has the audacity to talk about NVDAs earnings, but he himself touts about how good LRCX is when it comes to earnings. How's LRCX looking AH Vipul?"
NVDA will definitely 100% hit $457 after earnings act accordingly
It will definitely cross plus $615 by this Friday. Only God knows where we will go the following week but it will be high very very high. I think the results are out next week Thursday not this week. If they were this week we will see close to $800
$615 to $619 since February. What is that gain? .0001%????

If you can get any price over $500 short away & buy put options

How about having $72 millions now had you and I invested $1000 with Warren Buffett in 1959. That is what is called the power of reinvesting dividends and capital distributions and staying invested for the long run . There is no luck involved just persistence and consistency and patience and warrior like tendencies “no matter what I will hold on to my position “.

"Did you read it?“NVDA’s 24Billion advantage over AMD.”Yahoo won’t let me post the link but here are some comments I like and make the point, R&D investment is better than a share buyback program.“ The GPU giant has continued to maintain its lead in graphics processing by spending far more on research and development (R&D) than AMD. NVIDIA has spent more than $24 billion on R&D over its history.”Scroll down the summary page, it’s a short read.GL"
NVDA is 100% going to around $450 within a week or two! Save this post
i hope its down 20 again so i can buy more
See what happens when u put something in the White House instead of voting one in!!!!
Another nice daily chart. The all day slide into the close and finishing deep red
the time to buy is when a stock is hatednvda is hated and a screaming buy so buy buy buy
Market Kibbles just may want to check into One Flew Over The Cukoo’s Nest. What a weirdo.
Anyone want to bet me? NVDA goes to $399 before $620. Any takers?
"when bad news starts coming out, they will feed it with even more bad news, better get out now"
"NVDA was $589 last July 2020, NOW it’s $592. LOL  I am literally on the floor crying laughing. The entire time insiders have dumped hundreds of billions in stock"
If this breaks $640 we are going to see a lot of people take an early retirement

Market is peaked for now. I see big downturn and correction. NVDA to 400s.
If NVDA stock price is worth $626.31 the undervalued AMD stock price should be worth $300.
"July 20th, 4-1 split. Confirmed by Charles Schwab this morning."
Nvidia is great company BUT horrible stock to buy & hold. $300 to $150 last year! $615 to $463 this year. $649 to $590 and falling like a stone again
Anyone go back Pre market +$5 to $528 and play my “loin” short with every penny to their name? My outs are up 200% not bad
NVDA is a bottomless pit Ponzi Scheme stonk that Madoff wouldn’t even sniff 
"The blatant manipulation should stop, the market is demanding parity on stock prices of ; Undervalued AMD 79.18 vs Overhyped NVDA $591.21............. by end of 2021 undervalued AMD revenues will be greater than overhyped Nvidia."
"SO last month NVDA tanked $160 in 2 weeks from $615 to $463, AND now this month NVDA has already crashed $90 from $650 to $560 in a week. Hmm  CAN YOU SAY PONZI?"
Nvidia PE 89 and AMD PE 35. Both have almost same growth rate. Nvidia is clearly overvalued. It will go down below 500 on the earnings report.
NVDA $615 to $463 in February NVDA $648 to I guess $300 in April
poor people will make this volatile after split. bearish
NICE - $20 gap down at open! Maybe more!!!!!

"Haha now i have 100 than i will have 400Will buy more now so can get more with split,Remember split makes stock into bullish position"
a us senator bought and sold at its peak!!!! April 16th and has gone down ever since that day we all know the scam
Cramer says after Tuesday’s brutal sell off it is a buying buying opportunity. He said something like “the best second chance opportunity in his lifetime “. For once I agree with him
Has anybody see ohchee ohchee Salamander this afternoon.
beneficial week coming up. We could achieve close to $700
"I have made in excess of $10m shorting bloated growth stonks in 2021 by buying weekly put options, selling calls and naked shorting NVDA FSLY FROG & SPLK. Do you people realize how much money there is to be made shorting while all the insiders get fired and lose their jobs? There is just something so much more satisfying than being long!"
Old news. Nvidia is buying ARM for a reason. Duh! Intel an AMD have been preparing for it for quite some time.
Hi Jagoff Mario... what time 700? You've been promising us 700+ for like 39 straight weeks now.
A very very up day
NVIDIA Corp After Market Close (05/26) eps (est) 3.27 ...and they already said they'd beat on investors day. I'm not selling at all.
I saw a man without ARM and thought of NVDA.

"In five to ten years from now (its true even now), the chip sector will be the giant among giants. The use of chips present and future is mind boggling that is if you have the brains. The shorts and the day traders have no strategic depth (very sorry to say that) and I am thoroughly bewildered by their behavior and honest to my God (Jesus) I wonder if they are in their right mind. As for me I will buy more today and or buy FSELX (Fidelity semiconductors) Mutual Fund . I am looking at this sector to grow to $200 to $300 thrillions in the future."
"Cathy Wood just bought 33,000 shares of NVDA. She knows it’s undervalued with big momentum on its side "

Nvidia futures up too
OMG YESSSSS
Awesome finish as Big Mo still driving this stock. $600 right around the corner. No stopping this train

the big bummer is the brazilian and south african covid variants are able to greatly reduce the effictiveness of current vax's that's a big bummer instead of hoped for herd immunity by end of summer this yearwe're gonna be wearing masks and socially distancing and reduced capacity for at least the next year that's a depressing thought
"Ladies and gentleman, please put your seatbelts on because we are experiencing some turbulence as we lift off to the skies."
My take: NAS Futures will be up 300 by 9 am eastern we open up $15 or so and head up to that PLUS $25 or so on TRIPlE average volume
"WOW! Reuters reports ""Tech giants join together for an appeal to increase production of chips"". If that is not great/wonderful news then what is ? Thanko"
Unbelievably high volume today on this continuation of the crash from $650 NVDA R.I.P.
Cant this EVER hold a gain?
just bought back in at retest of prior all time highs620c with two and half days to go hope for the best
NVDA outperforming the NASDAQ today nicely.
$615 to $463$548+ to $590 now and no bottomAny guesses? I say $490 next week
Up $25 Thursday on at Least TRIPLE normal volumne
NVDA ROCKS!!
The chart about Nvidia says “bullish pattern detected “.
"Boooom All aboard the rocket ship.Best stock potential on the market, any market If your not in yet, still time to treble your hard earned cash"
A very very up day in the pipeline today. Definitely up by around $89 by Friday. Futures are down slightly but with my 44 years of investing experience let me assure you (1) that futures are only 1.5% of the market (2) futures almost always mostly turn positive at the opening. So don’t worry too much about it
"glad I bought in early January, nice"
Bye bye $600Need $589 for derby  day Will be $1m profit from my weekly 600 put options bought around $630
Shorting $611.59Inner loin short I could feel it Thank me later
"So for UK, Softbank owning ARM was not a concern, but NVDA owning it is. How??"
Most chips are down more . Might have something to do with those new price targets of up to 800.
To those that told me I should diversify (I sold 50 of my 500 shares of NVDA) late last year. The 50 shares that I spent on various other stocks has declined and I'm under water. My 450 shares of NVDA have increased. NVDA is clearly a powerhouse company and the future of AI. I'M NEVER DIVERSIFYING AGAIN! ONLY NVDA FROM HERE ON OUT!!
Anyone believe NVDA was $589 in July 2020?
NVDA “down 50” in April And tax day comethLosers who traded via RobinHood last year now have to ante up to Uncle Sam and liquidate high flyers tanking on margin to pay upr
"To all the TARDS who supposedly bought the exact low $560 down from $650, you will be selling at a loss I 100% inner loin guarantee if"
Mounted a counter strike but simply ran out of time. A great day tomorrow
I only got 35 shares. I need more more more!
RED RED RED yesssssss down $50 this week going back to $463 gap
NVDA 1yr performance $358 to $585 = 63.4%
Profit taking today. I think will be green tomorrow.
"Last Thursday I read 100  consecutive posts “going to $700”—-was down $10 from highs that day, $10 Friday, $25 yesterday and will be down $50 today NVDA  R.I.P."
"IMPORTANT - TSMC's talks about HPC HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING - NOT ""DATACENTERS"". Remember $nvda hasn't won any exascale supercomputers! $intc has won one, but they DONT HAVE 7nm TSMC's fab chips. SO MOST OF TSMC's recent ER talk about HOC is ... AMD! $nvda has a tiny part with Ampere! We know this because AMPER NEEDS EPYC ROME TO RUN! So we know exactly how many Amper system which are 7nm were installed based on EPYC Rome use in such!

At $648 there were at least 100 posts in a row claiming NVDA was going to 700 how’s that working out for you I am up 1000% on my weekly put options BTW
Intel has tiles.. whereas Nvidia has bumpkin. Extinct dinosaur Nvidia GPU's.
"So I have not been able to find or get a feel on how the UK will ultimately rule on the Arm deal. This snippet from the referenced article is all a google search would bring up on Nvdia's Grace/Arm processor.""Nvidia also said that the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre will make a new supercomputer dubbed ""Alps"" using the new ""Grace"" processors and built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co . The computing system, which Huang said will be 10 times faster than the world's current best supercomputer, will be used for tasks such as weather forecasting and physics research.""https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/nvidia-to-directly-challenge-intel-with-arm-based-grace-server-chip/82043858Sorry if this is old news.

"Only $175 until Kevin's guaranteed gap fill at $463 or he never posts again, again, again."
Buying more today. Best tech stock on the planet. Price targets of 800 and they'll reiterate before and after earnings.
Down $8 from the highs. If things are so great why would you sell after a split announcement?
Oh my God Dow is up 227 points. Msft about to go positive. Then the rest of the market will turn positive soon and then there will be a boom but Salamander will be in a gloom
Up $20 a share on buying tesla dip this morning already...same applies here buy buy buy
ARM deal canceled “I heard through the grapevine” at $576! Trade accordingly! Anyone read the brutal bearish Seeking Alpha NVDA article @ $576 ORNO???
Price to earnings only 89? LOLOLOL. Can you say BUBBLE!?!
Shorting 100 more shares once it breaks 591
Time to short..NVDA overran in a month.
How many longs are going to make posts about buying more with imaginary money?
"Kibble now you know why I am a legend and never lose: sold a ton of the 5/14 570s from 0.42 to $3.00+ non stop every 5 minutes for hours. Going to Pimlico so needed around $50,000 for the day. BAM, hit the 10 moving average and since there was zero volume, rocketed downward below $570 ALL expired at $0 so made 100% LOL so easy on every option sold all day long non stop"
NVDA rules:Market goes up NVDA tanksMarket stays flat NVDA tanksMarket tanks NVDA crashes Any questions?
"My 580 weekly puts up 10,000% in a week! Oh my god why did I only buy $20,000 worth?"
"This split was effectively announced last month when it was listed in the 2021 shareholder meeting agenda that we all received: ""Approval of an amendment to our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 2 billion shares to 4 billion shares."" Yesterday's announcement was not surprising at all."
up 200$ a share in a month is madness ....
if you didn't buy it this price don't buy it because it's the elevators going up
Just your typical $10+ intraday drop!!!
"Salamander, Kevin. Tevin looked between his loins and couldn't find his Johnson."

NVDA down $50 today would be a nice  start to eventually filling her $463 “gap”
"NVDA: NASDAQ down 100 NVDA down $20NASDAQ up 200, NVDA up 15ANY QUESTIONS"
"NVDA is on the verge of turning its sector on fire. NVDA already is a different company and now with the implementation of the server chips and the pending Arm Holding acquisition, Both of these events in near unison could vertically increment the share price to well over $1k+ at a rapid pace before the end of 2021. Once they breach $1k+ NVDA ought to begin the process of discussing a 4to 1 or 5 to 1 stock split. for further upside going forward."
"What $nvda has announced is a FUTURE plan to START do what AMD and Xilinx have been doing, including with Samsung. It's all in the air. So nVidia's ""exploring"" to work with Mediatek to SPECIFY an ARM based laptop. Why need of Mediatek? For ARM? LOL isn't nVidia's announced doing datacenters Grace ARM? Except that Grace isn't a general purpose ARM server, it's a GPU with a few ARM cores integrated to do some local to the GPU operations. Is Mediatek which provides LOW CHEAP smartphones and TVs ARM based chips, a fit with high end supposedly nVidia's raytracing GPUs? Nope. They are no match with Samsung. But nVidia's copycat trying to do what AMD HAS DONE long ago. Read the bottom of this blog. Jansen copies Lisa Su's ""the best is yet to come"" too! Pathetic. Is nVidia's $400B market cap justified especially vs AMD's just $100B? If AMD's market cap gets to nVidia's, tgat means 4X the current PPS or $250 just like that! But AMD is much more than nVidia's and $intc combined! See the 5 years outlook? ... I see a $1000 SP.Read the bottom of this wishful thinking blog:https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/12/arm-ecosystem-acceleration/"
"So it's ok for the japanese to be delinquent owners of the most important cpu but it's not ok for a company like Nvidia to purchase iT, nurture it and turn it into something that will push the server industry and humankind into a more efficient, faster better future?"
I know this is going to sound pretty insane BUT you hold a stock in NVDA that will never trade higher ever again
4:1 split usually means earnings call in 5 days will exceed expectations! Mgt is optimistic of a bullish future for NVDA!
"What CFO Kress said that ignited the NVDA stock ...Excerpt from The Information Nvidia reported that its April quarter revenue was tracking above the $5.3 billion outlook it had given a couple of months ago. That outlook implied growth of 72% versus a year ago, so you can just imagine what Nvidia will actually report.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in a statement: “We are experiencing broad-based strength, with all our market platforms driving upside to our initial outlook.” Translated into English, that means Nvidia’s business is doing great everywhere."
More RobinHood investors will now pile on. Go NVDA !
"Nice Volume 16,602,66010 day avg 6,576,760"
The daily short traders baling...earnings in less than 2 weeks...added more on this pullback...weak hand will regret selling
"All the split does is make the stock more affordable for investors that can't afford a $600 stock. That being said, that means the stock attracts more buyers and more demand which is a good thing."
Nvidia chip is a dinosaur soon to be extinct replaced with Intel's sleek new chiplet based Xe at 42 TFLOPS.

"Nvidia is a dinosaur chip company, soon to be extinct replaced with Intel Xe."
Where are all the shorts?
"Remember, Nvidia can't handle CPUs the Denver project, QCMM and many others exited ARM server projects."
"Definitely $616 end of the day. I think it will easily be close to $800 by split day. That’s $200 post split but then it will move swiftly up to at least $250 a share which again equals to $1,000 pre split which I have been saying all along"
Anyone see that? +$1.35 to -$3 in one click. NVDA = PONZI
Anyone like NVDA pattern of lower lows and lower highs or no???
let's all say 'Grace's before super tonight and gather grace profits all week. yahoooo!!
Tomorrow will be a greatly up day. This was a great buying opportunity today
NOW is when you should be buying...just saying!
-$21 and still dropping. Longs “huanged”again
Stock split! Cool! It’s going to be a little higher than the price I originally bought in at.
Shorts covering taking advantage of traders selling after buying for the past few days. That's going to help as after this transient real buying will happen. Results and prospective are superb more than any other semi. Why hold $intc $nvda or $mu when AMD's prospects are so high for the next years? Makes no sense so all other semis will sell to buy AMD.
will noynsurprise to see this at 469 again they will do everything to drive the retail investors out with loss before those earning on May wich will be an obvious BOOM
Finally after a week some real volume on this crash! $564 + NVDA = Superman + Kryptonite

Awww... looks like Messy Tummy has retreated to the safety on her underground bunker for Nvda bag holders.
so the hype about $NVDA is making it sound like $AMD will go to sleep with nothing to launch in the 3 years to hypothetical Grace. Amazing?
Making the easy call NVDA down $50 tomorrow minimum
Nvidia is going to need more marketing hype.
If it drops below 400 I'll buy more.
AMAT earning tonight. Blowout and chip makers 52 week high. LRCX $675 tomorrow. Buy.
Typical morning head fake ! MM boys trying to get your shares on the cheap!

-$20 again tomorrow

"After the bell: Nvidia initiated with an Outperform and $800 price target at BairdBaird analyst Tristan Gerra initiated coverage of Nvidia with an Outperform rating and $800 price target. The price target is a Street-high according to Bloomberg. As Nvidia ""increasingly moves to platform solutions"" targeting and enabling all artificial intelligence markets markets, while diversifying its architecture offering, the company is ""poised to over time dominate data center,"" Gerra tells investors in a research note. The analyst also expects Nvidia to ""dominate"" the market for chips used in data centers."

"Nvidia announces four-for-one stock splitNVIDIA announced that its board of directors declared a four-for-one split of NVIDIA's common stock in the form of a stock dividend to make stock ownership more accessible to investors and employees. The stock dividend is conditioned on obtaining stockholder approval at the company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held virtually on Thursday, June 3, at 11 a.m. PT to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 4 billion shares. If approval is obtained, each NVIDIA stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021, will receive a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, 2021. Trading is expected to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on July 20."
If you observe carefully the prices of overhyped Nvidia $553.62 and undervalued AMD $74.88 you will know what stock to buy.

NVDA is turning green against this bad market...watch out to the upside if the Naz turns around too!
Remember watch the VOLUME at $intc $nvda and AMD...

50pts possible upside this week alone on all the news that will be revealed. It really is that simple.

I wanted to add a chunk of shares to my position weeks back when the stock corrected to $460+ a share. I was changing brokers and couldn't trade. Meanwhile, the stock recovered somewhat and once my new account was activated I couldn't buy at my low and did nothing. Have my current position but with the stock up over 140 points the timing could have not been worse. Way it goes. But content I have a great position in this stock."

they can cry all they wantit is not in dispute nvda is in an uptrendread the chart and dispute that
Almost all the tech stocks on my watch list are up huge today except NVDA- UGH.
Sell Overvalued overhyped NVDA $619.55 and buy brutally undervalued AMD $79.38 with the best products at 7nm in the world market. Do your own DD and win big.
Volume is low but even more strange jump especially much higher than $intc $nvda and $mu today. You would think that shorts can get the PPS down because the volume is low AND they have 80m+ shorts to cover AHEAD of the ER next week. But... they cannot someone is buying strongly so no dumping a little to get the shares of loss sell limits ... hummm very strange especially ahead of the ER.
"Back in the green for the day. Was this morning the bottom? I can't imagine the tech sector, specifically this stock not running up prior to earnings given it's potential. But the Whales have been playing hard ball. Tough call"

i'm far from perfect but as a trader i tend to know what i am talking about and i back it up
Tevin is Kevin.
"We are in 4% from bottom 5%, recovered 1.5% in 10 mins. Get ready for $600 by tomorrow"
"The drawdown in price is NVDA's own recompense for not getting its products to it's customers. I should have sold my shares on the last spike but no biggie cause they are all gratis. Meanwhile we cant buy a vid card unless we run scalper bots on our computers. NVDA used to have direct sales on its website, but no more. I suspect its own employees and Best Buys of being or colluding with the scalpers. At this point 8 months after release I couldnt care less if NVDA gets ARM or not and wont shed a tear if they auger straight into the dirt."
"This stock shouldn’t trade over 550 at most, but realistically 500.."
NVDA will be $450 BEFORE earnings and god only knows after earnings/be prepared because I am never wrong/save this brilliance
Low volumes today. Good discounts entry points for longs.

NVDA investors are over reacting to buy this good news as stock price is quite ahead to its P/E and book value. Top of only few of hedge fund managers are holding more than 30% floating shares. Any time they can book some profits at elevated stock price. Upside is very limited at this point until dramatic new profits on incsreased revenue.
We are splitting 4-1 and announcement came when Nvidia was at $586. So Huang wants Nvidia to open at $200 open in July? Is that the hint for upcoming results and new record price?

"For those of you not familiar with the chip industry. I’ve seen some posts suggesting Nvidia profits are going to drop with Ethereum 2.0 and EIP 1559 in July. Although both of these will have a large effect on GPU mining it’s true. You’ll see the mining industry start to lose pace this summer as miners sell off their cards before the jacked up prices begin to fall. Nvidia are not the ones making the money on these jacked up prices to begin with.. it’s aftermarket and scalpers. When mining goes away Nvidia GPUs will continue to fly off shelves. Gamers are demanding these cards since they came out. Gaming is also the biggest and fastest growing entertainment industry. Nvidia will have some ups and downs due to being linked with mining but this company will go nowhere but up long term. AMD is still playing catch up in the graphics department. I may not suggest when you should buy this stock but it is a great long term play. I’m a gamer and a miner so take from that what you will. Even with a silicon shortage effecting all businesses this is temporary.. the pandemic has caused a large increase to the gaming community and trust me it isn’t going to fade as things go back to “normal.” If you’re interested in this stock timing could be difficult but there is a ton of upside with their data centres, gaming and the huge possibility of the arm deal closing."
"USA and UK are close Allies. UK is in NATO & member 5-eyes. NVDA buying ARM benefits UK givingthem access to NVDIA Technology. Killing deal is like UK shooting themselves in the foot. Well, maybeI just killed my argument, it is the Brits after all."
LOOK  at this little piggy  OINK OINK  OMG  LOL  new freshly baked lows of the day LOL  I want to know who is in @ $578? Mark my words you won’t ever see that again in your lives! #FACTS: July 2020 NVDA $589 April 2021 NVDA $569

the chart giving a middle finger to the longs today
my 20k shares of nvda purchased at the march 2020 lows will now be 100k of nvda sharesall called out right at the march 2020 185 lows
"Heading up big time today. Definitely a $1,000 per share company"
"WOW shortage of chips world wide. China complaining. U.S. complaining. Ford complaining. GM complaining. U.S. government to help set up new production facilities. Tell you nvidia is going to $1,000 or higher soon. real soon. And yes other companies in the semi conductor sector are hot too. very hot. sizzling hot."
"This stock will be $700 by the time it splits, time to buy people. I killed it when apple and tesla split:)"
"eps revisions keep going up, up, up. next year low estimate eps - $12.55. next year high estimate eps - $20. personally, i am interested in the year after that, when they introduce grace server chips and possibly other integrated datacenter goodies. if market gets a whiff of success in this area -----> moonshot."
At least AMD is red again.
"Go back & check my post at $609+. I said, and I quote, “if NVDA doesn’t hit $589 today I will never post again.”"
could end higher today. a greatly great day tomorrow and the rest of the week. money coming back to nasdaq and the tech sector. Everyone singing song about the chip sector and nvidia. Just look at the yahoo. WOW. Thanko
I said at $592 down $30 today I admit I was wrong “only” down $20+
ok since you are in NVDA you obviously know what you are doing here so anyone got some hot tips that i can start doing DD on...I'm kinda tapped out in the self research arena and need some experienced direction herethanks in advance
The sound ya hear 99% of the time at the open
Everything is turning positive. By day’s end Nvidia could be up $12. That’s why stay invested and buy more from time to time or on a regular basis. Buy core companies such as Nvidia and buy some great mutual funds such as FSELX etc and then sit back and relax and watch your investments grow
Call options...CRUSHED!
ARM server in 2023? ROTFLOL.

"""Mother of all recoveries"" ignites stocks across Europe - V Shaped Recovery Stocks in the region have vaulted back to records, and the euro capped its best week against the dollar so far this year. A big turnaround in projected profits for corporate Europe shows a brewing recovery in the investment and consumption cycle.Analysts are ratcheting up estimates for European miners, banks, auto makers and oil producers -- all industries set to boom as the global economy roars back to health. Upgrades now outnumber downgrades by most in over a decade, according to data from Citigroup Inc.Whether all that enthusiasm is justified will become clearer this month, when earnings season kicks off. Behind the bullish shift in markets is a belief that Europe will be successful in immunizing the bulk of its population within a few months, and evidence that the U.S. and Asia are on a solid path of recovery."
What time RED and what time under $600 ? please advise.
How do longs here make any money if this stock is the same price as it was 3 months ago?
I would like to hook my brain up to mine bitcoin when I sleep at night. Can NVDA help with that?
Not near a real time quote ticker. Anyone tell me if NVDA  is still above $578? Out at lunch with prospective clients and don’t have access to real time. Thanks  in advance.
Man am I rich wow cha Ching
Nvidia chip is a dinosaur going extinct soon. To be replaced by Intel Xe at 42 TFLOPS.
1000$ tomorrow
"How many months until $1,000. It is going to happen!"
that's unreal
Slowly slowly everything is turning positive and Nvidia will too.
Ladies & Gentlemen boys & germs  new freshly baked monthly lows going into real bad earnings
"Time to load up undervalued AMD, the new leader in the industry with modern superior secure 7nm vs overhyped overpriced NVDA $566.30, do your own HOMEWORK and win big when you exit 2021."
I now change my price target for NVDA from $463 to $299. Short term! Please trade accordingly
Inner loin $610.14! Anyone listen? Hello? NVDA is going back to $400s
At least 12 upgrades coming soon. No doubt it will shoot to the sky . Actually the whole chip sector and the technology sector will be upgraded. Also schools end in two weeks and the fall buying spree will begin in all earnest. Electronics is always the favorite
What a great company. It is down slightly but because it is so good it is clawing back to positivity. Such resolute and determination rarely seen in the annals of great  companies
Market already beginning to turn positive. By God stay on course and you will be happy. Sit down drink some coffee and think think. Do you think Cramer or Suzy etc are in the market to make you money? The answer is a definite no. They merely advise you so they can make money or their clients can make money. For example they will buy a company in big numbers then ask you to do so after they have bought sufficiently and when we do the price goes up and they stand to benefit because they bought it cheaper than your. I can make up tens of other examples too. In summary buy and hold and hold and buy
LOL - large portion of the gains gone. May even close RED!!!!!!
I have to admit I almost covered and went long around $600 until I saw  Mr. Depends Pants  Pooper  get elected in the White House  so I quadrupled down short

NVDA was $589 last July 4 incredible earnings reports $548LOL 
The world’s smartest and most successful investor said yesterday “the smartest thing is to buy into a S&P 500 index fund”. We all know Nvidia is a big holding in all index funds.
"Investors rotating out of big tech to the cyclicals and transportation stocks. Short term hurting the high quality techs. This will not last. NVDA, AMZN, AVGO and other great techs will rebound. Short term pain for long term gain. Seen this too many times."
"Not another opening cliff dive?. Yup, those analysts put it to you with their outrageous $800 PT’s This just might retrace to the high 4’s"
I don't want to imagine how many people are shorting this one today lol ....
Too easy 
NVDA UP 3.89%AMD UP 2.4%even with the buybacks AMD can’t touch NVDA!
up on good volume...sweet...the NVDA train has left the station
Oh no! Now CNBC is taking notice of $nvda which means they will report on everything negative (hard to say anything negative about nvda) and try to bring the stock down!
You didn’t think this would hold $573 did you? Great short opening bell Monday. Learning yet you stumps?
"Final half hour, NASDAQ going kick it into high gear! Hedge funds laughing at those who sold! Mind you if you made a profit, congrats!"
to all the num- nut shorts. Your doing nothing to the stock price. GET A LIFE
$700 before split
I pray & hope that NVDA falls $100 like NFLX soon they seem to go lock step
"ALYI is starting it's incremental move up. Check out the yahoo message board for the details of why, and how much it's expected to run to."
"Holding up well, but markets are now my concern as to how all stocks (High Flyers) will do in the near future (next 6 months)!"
As the Secretary of State said we just want to explore any National Security concerns in regards to the NVDA/ARMs deal. That's why I said this is just an overview. This deal will go through.
"If you look at the performance outlook for short term, medium term and long term they are all green which is equal to a bullish indicator both for short term and medium and long term ."
Imagine convincing yourself all is well when this gets lower and lower everyday
Down $15! OK now. Just $15 more! I guaranteed down $30 today
"$615 over two months ago right to $463. Was $648 last week, can we hit $450 in May?"
Let’s see how much the MM boys cover in the last half hour!
"With the marketing hype NVDA goes to $623.25 with the promise to have a processor in 2023, then undervalued AMD should be at $300 with real superior products in the market at 7nm. AMD has more experience building modern CPU."

Laddies and Gentlemen boys & germs WHAT TIME RED? What time $463?
"Waiting for it to get cheaper includes the risk of missing out. Good to have some cash on the sidelines, just in case. But this goes 25% higher this year imo."
If NVDA doesn’t go under $600 today I will NEVER post ever again in my life! SAVE THIS BRILLIANCE & trade accordingly
ALWAYS BUY STOCKS WHEN THE MARKETS SELL OFF. BUY TECHNOLOGY AND BUY NVIDIA!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!THE POOR LOSER BASHER SPECTATOR TROLLS ARE READING THIS AND LOSING THEIR MINDS!!!!CHOO CHOO!
What falls faster? And be honest: Panties on prom night after taking ecstasy or NVDA stonk?
NVIDIA is up 5.44% to 607.31
I was able to buy shares at $614.78. It was a gift from the gods !!
"Boooom it’s still climbing...Kevin, please add more negative comments, you’ve got a good feel for the market....Hahahahah"
"It is time to hit $700, There is nothing that can stop it! After the ARM deal $1,000. per share will be as low as we go."
"Another day where nothing much happens. Well, better a loss of $0.45 than anything else. Still holding over 600!"
"Skyworks beat also and is getting hammered. Just like what happened to aapl, amd and msft. NVDA will get hammered as well"

"TSMC has guided way higher for Q2 and raised 2021 outlook. This is AMD ... expect AMD's guiding higher!""The firm forecast second-quarter revenue would be in a range of $12.9 billion to $13.2 billion, compared with $10.38 billion in the same period a year earlier. It also lifted its revenue growth forecast for 2021 to about 20%, versus an earlier forecast of a mid-teens percentage.""PPS will get to new highs after the ER, higher PT upgrades from analysts. Yes this means $100+ within weeks! Read everything about TSMC just announced ER. Smartphones actually declined! HPC not just compensated for that but got higher that a year ago and tge usually highest revenues of the year Q4. Add that TSMC has given AMD 80% additional 7nm fab allocation, it's clear. No it's not $nvda which makes most of its GPUs at ""8nm"" actually 10nm Samsung fab. It's AMD. $intc has guided decline of revenues for the 2021 year while AMD guided 37% revenues increase this year. In addition we've seen PCs demand rising in addition to the laptops and we know massive datacenters expansion for cloud going on.Connect the dots, you get $100+ new high in couple of weeks!"
Buying more at the open today
Buy more first thing Monday Morning. Nvidia is going up and up it will go my sweetie pie. Thanko
And again no volume. It may stick around for a few days between 550 and 575 but then I'm expecting a traditional run up into earnings. Which will be outstanding.

"If you don't believe NVDA is worth at least 1.5T in cap watch Jensen's GTC keynote. So much happening, so many announcements, I can't even wrap my head around it. The company is blasting into the outer space. Share are dirt cheap at these levels. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAn_oiZwUXA"

yo will reverse and end higher today. Babba thinks it is jitters from yesterday and then futures aint much weight carrying anyways. Thanko
AGAIN WHAT TIME RED? 
NVDA will become the fundamental backbone of everything AI. Still early and the train has not left the station. Still buying monthly.
Cathie Wood or ARKK sold all her NVDA non stop selling 24/7 YES She knows something
Just bought 225 more of Nvidia. I expect a split soon too. Total numbers held pretty decent size . Grand kids will be happy  they call me one day to thank me. I may not be around. Perhaps they will drop in a few flowers for me.
people liquidated tons of crypto yesterday . guess where all the cash is flowing into now
Why would anyone buy NVDA @ $601 when there are 1000 other better stonks that actually go up

Weak hands all gone. All clear now on continuing an upward trend. 
Just buy. Will be back at 600 in a blink of an eye. Buy low sell high. Duh.
Chip demand is through the roof. Chinese EV manufacturers lusting for NVDA chips. The gamers and the miners pounding the table for more (expensive) NVDA chips. And there sits NVDA in the catbird seat. 
Futures showing remarkable improvements. Anyways with years and years of investing experience let me assure you that futures hardly mean much. It compromises of about 1.5% of the market. Nothing much to write to mama about
Great company and future but I think the stock is over-priced.
up up and away
where is Tevin? I heard below $600 was guaranteed today
"I see all the PUMPERS are using their MONOPOLY money to “buy the dip” today. Hmm  Funny how they all lied at $650 saying it was going to $700 and at $560 they just happen to have money in cash  waiting for $100 fall in a week, to buy more"
"I just now out in a GOOD TIL CANCEL order covering my NVDA short & going long, I SWEAR, @ $457"

One of these days soon  NVDA will be “down $100”.
"Remember, the arm deal bad news many weeks ago is already baked in. Longs know this."
Our NVDA short here at my firm is the largest position we’ve ever held in 30 years. Yawn . Anyone like the -$10 on Friday when the news was leaked? Or the -$100 today?
$609.87 is maybe  the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life ever. Are you serious? What time RED ???
Makes one wonder if you need to put money in other stocks to begin with. They all did worse the last year. Glad that nearly 70% of my portfolio is about nvidia.
"Just a thought. I'll agree that the company has been working to diversify their sales portfolio but the stock is still being massively fueled by crypto miners. It wouldn't surprise me if 50% of their sales come from miners. This is eerily reminiscent of the 2018 run up and subsequent crash of the stock. Despite NVIDIA's (let's call them mediocre at best) efforts to ""control"" cryptomining, miners have found fairly easy workarounds allowing them to use the cards for mining anyways. I'm an avid gamer and have been trying to purchase one of these cards since launch but you can't pre-order them and they're being snatched up by bots everywhere. The US constitution states that only the government can coin and regulate currency. With cryptocurrency getting more negative attention from global governments as a worthless/speculative stock/currency, all it's going to take is someone to bring up this portion of the constitution and bitcoin and the like will lose their value overnight, dragging Nvidia along with it. I think a reckoning is coming and Nvidia is going to pay the price for not doing more to prevent miners from snatching up all the card stock. South Korea and India are already looking at banning cryptocurrencies. I think the U.S. will soon follow."
Anyone else think  it will fall $50 today when HUANG warns & also calls off ARM deal????
"Good company good product but bad investment, NVDA is a pump and dump stock"

Earnings run baby!!! $700
"My mind is clear and analytical. It is dynamic and it is focused. It is flexible and receptive to new ideas and prospects but the conclusion is Nvidia is headed to $1,000 and perhaps even more. Now if you have a corrupt mind and nefarious motive not conducive to fair reporting and fair practices then I cannot help you and neither will I perpetually try to sway your comments. It’s just very bothersome when you post the same dead beat messages day in day out largely to impress the crowd with your so call prowess which carries no meaning to most of us in general and to me in particular."
$100 off from its high. Stock very volatile this year. But worth holding and possible adding shares.Great company led by an brilliant CEO. Earnings up next week. Core position for me and just about anyone.
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA. GETTING THE BERTRAM READY FOR SOME CHANNEL ISLANDS FISHING AND DIVING. LIFE IS GOOD MY FRIENDS, LIFE IS GOOD!EARNINGS COMING SOON MAY 26TH THEY SHOULD BE OUTSTANDING!NVIDIA $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!"
nice!!! destroying options...teaching peeps not to gamble. Looking to add very soon here.
Stop it with the political bs and grieving. This mb is about the biggest name in chips and not about a fundraiser for billionaires. I doubt any of those visit this board to begin with. Let's talk nvidia.
This is a message to anyone long NVDA @ $648+
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
There’s our roughly up $15 open on its way to plus $25 or more on triple volume
"So after the stock split, when NVDA goes down $1, you lose $4. Nice."
$642 at the close
Did you hug your family today ? Did you pat your puppy  today? Did you have your breakfast today? Have you seen Tevin today? Have you seen Kevin today? Have you seen Jon today? Please answer all these solemnly. I would like to know even if you consider me a nosy person! Thanks
Down $50 today would get us within $457 range after earnings
Ladies & Germs  boys & girls WHAT TIME  RED? 9:35 EST is my brilliance lock. NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
I recall the first week of February when NVDA was $615. It’s like the movie  GROUNDHOG DAY
$650 to $700 coming to a store near you
"Relax longs - Just plain manipulation by MMs to grab shares before ER, my opinions.. Wondering if I can buy short term calls, but knowing MMs they will damp any movement after ER... LOL"
Only $130 to go to hit Kevin's guaranteed gap fill at $463.
Hated stockso this will rocket up
A friend is starting a Cathie Wood SHORT fund. His goal is to get NVDA to $350 and TSLA to $100.
Fellow Longs I think we close plus $30 today! Wow glad did not sell those Calls the other day!
"If true regarding the split , then remember I have been saying that for a while although I said 2:1 split. Frankly 4:1 is even better because besides institutional buying you will now see lot more individuals buying. Second, share price always rises substantially before and after the split when the split is announced. I have multiple examples of what I just said"
yo lower start but will end sharply higher. When yo put too much pressure it is bound to explode and yes siri bob it will rise shrply to the sky it goes. I and the rest of the babbas ain't panicking.

Nvidia stock prediction next week ?will it go 600?
"Despite the pumpers claim that the UK/ARM news is nothing, the market disagrees with them.NVDA will start testing support levels. $580 test is nextDon't be surprised if it eventually tests the recent bottoms at $475"
This is typical of $nvda before earnings 5/26. I’m buying buying buying cause it will certainly climb back up to/past $700. So please sell; so there is more for the savvy investors.
Nice volume buying into the close.
"Market crash has started , look for 500 levels for NVDA in a few weeks"
NASDAQ rallied 100 points NVDA at daily lows NVDA R.I.P. 
Best stock on my watchlist. Maybe somebody knows what's up.
"My NVDA weekly put options I bought all above $610 the past week or two, are up 1000%, 3500%, 8000% and 12,000%, respectively. This is the second time I have made over $3m in less than 3 weeks short NVDA. Just this year! Last time it fell $160 in 3 weeks, this time $100 so far, hoping it drops $300"
$649 to $560 on zero news  EXACTLY back to the penny before INVESTORS DAY when they announced 10 new fake products & upped fake earnings guidance
A trap for shorts today because it will rise sharply today.
NVDA will be down $50 again tomorrow! Anyone care to make a friendly wager???
The greatest feeling is being short 100% on margin NVDA SPLK 225 to 113 FSLY 122 to 40 FROG 90 to 30 while everyone else involved is losing their life savings

"ARM introduces ARM9 architecture- wow - LinkArm has unveiled its first new architecture in a decade to raise performance and security in the “next 300 billion Arm-based chips” to be delivered to the market over the coming decade. The firm said the new Armv9 architecture, replacing Armv8, is geared towards the move from general-purpose to “ubiquitous specialized” compute processing, notably as AI, IoT, and 5G gain momentum.Simon Segars, the company’s chief executive, stated: “The Armv9 architecture signals a new era for our company; a globally-pervasive platform driving secure AI-driven computing that will enable our ecosystem of more than 1,000 partners well into the 2030s. Armv9 will be at the forefront of the next 300 billion Arm-based chips; driven by the demand for increasingly specialized, secure and high performance processing built on the economics, design freedom, and accessibility of general-purpose compute.”"
"Smart investors and Institutions are moving to undervalued AMD, the new leader in the world with the best products in the market at 7nm."
next week earnings run up starts this afternoon
"Honestly I said “down $30” today as a joke considering the NASDAQ & NVDA were flat at the open WALLA hit $592, blinked $468! LOL! No news & huge volume"
nvda weekly 550p were 1.50 two weeks agonow at 9.00a multi-id schizo is making all sorts of wild claimscompletely detached from reality
$6 TOAST 
$640 was hilarious now is the time to finally sell and get short no catalyst on the horizon and volume drying up 
"1000 by end of year for sure, they are leagues ahead of the field."
Has to rally $6 tomorrow for shareholders at the highs today in NVDA to break even LOLLLLLL
"I knew eventually it would get above $600, but I didn't expect it to be this dramatic."
600 here we come

So for the sake of easy calculation for my part, let's say the share price remain $600 then. So my shares will change from 500 shares of $600 per share to 2000 shares of $150 per share. So how much shares will i receive from the announced dividend?"

"Throw percents out the window unless the stocks you are comparing with started with equal prices. It takes more to make a percent the higher the SP. A 10% gain on a $70 stock is $7 while a 10% gain on a $500 stock is $50. Which would you rather be holding? a $70 stock that goes up 10% or a $500 stock that goes up 5%? Use dollar and percent amounts together, not just percent amounts thrown around on stock message boards. I have oil/gas pipeline stocks I bought last year that are up 500% plus, but that equals to only $20 per share on one. Use dollar amount and percent amounts when comparing a stocks performance, not one or the other."

And I bought more. Upgrades on the way and they alteady said sales were better than expected on investor's day. Duh. The countdown has begun.
Hello ..I am a newbie to NVDA stock splits and dividends..Does that mean we all get 3 extra freebie shares on top of own shares from NVDA after splitting ? Thx ..and Any Thoughts ?
Why wouldn’t they wait til earnings to announce this split??? @@hmm?
New all time highs finally $616 sell and short cover $463
"How to make life easy: Buy Nvidia and just relax, Jensen will reward you handsomely."
"Don't be fooled. .. $intc and $nvda collapsing, AMD should soon get to a new all times high."
Literally this stonk had one good day in a year the usual HUANG hype machine in his leather chaps and right back down the toilet  zero interest zero volume ARK spelled the end
And $16 up going to cross $600 swiftly today. $630 is next target
Let’s play a game for real here: WHERE DOES NVDA CLOSE THIS WEEK? It was $648.57 on Thursday I say it closes $540
AMD is a buying opportunity.Should NVDA merge with AMD?
"loving this...this same thing happens every couple years, look back to 2018...in a few months, silly sellers cut the price in half! Only to see it triple. I'm looking to take advantage of this drop...Massive chip shortage, world is getting more digital, blah, blah. If you think NVDA will not be higher 2 years out...well...your mistake my advantage."
how many bears got trapped?
Market watch just stated that Joe Machin will knock down the Capital Gain Tax in the senate and will prevent it from passing and even if there is a capital tax increase it will be slight
closed out 4/16 620c at test of 640what a nice way to start the day after a wonderful week i adore this company
"I made the following post last Friday. Obviously, we are going to get that taken care of here shortly.——Only 3 weekly closes higher than today’s. Another 4% would take care of all of those. Happy Friday for the Green Team!"
"Chart master says S & P to 3850, NVDA sub $400, are you ready ?"
NVDA best in breed! Don’t forget the future is NVDA! Btw Apple going lead the NASDAQ higher today!
people buy this becuase they think so many people bought graphics card for bitcoin mining.. In reality.. market cap way over that.. This ridin on momentum.. I can no qualms with gambling. I do so myself but you guys are at the peak right now. tsla had elon musk train. bitcoin kinda dropping right now.. This has nothing to bolster it up. stock split? maybe.. but traditionally drops on stock splits but this year different. you guys can try gambling.. maybe it will do what apple and tesla did and go up. this market is just dumb. this is 350 billion market cap... GEEZ.. I don't think so.
greedily held on a bit too long on 590c exit early today after the retest of yesterday's closing highs failed and got back in on 620c a bit too early on today's pullback but it's all good

"If the NASDAQ went to 100,000 NVDA would still go to $299"
Made 5000%+ on my put options bought last week lol 
Little down in the first hour. Take it as a buying opportunity because it won’t stay down for too long a time.
$648 to $635 NVDA R.I.P.   
Basically all tech following same pattern this morning.
ot SQM beat earnings estimates and declared a dividend. SQM will TRIPLE lithium for electric vehicles by '25! As old contracts roll off SQM will be able to double or triple what it charges if electric vehicle sales stay strong.
Intel already has 70% of the graphics market. Just 10% more and Nvidia is done. Sleek Tile based Xe just around the corner.
Puts are going to print today
547 added to my short
anyone with a functioning brain knew this moment was coming nvda taking on the giants and the moment has arrived
Looking good. Should be good for $700 in the next 3 months.
400s is reality----peaked. I warned you
Why are bulls always so gullible?
"You can tell how scared and how much money the shorts have on the line based on how volatile and aggressive they are being on all the tech stocks. I feel bad fpr NVDA, great company, great tech, great leadership yet it's been pretty much sideways for months. The stock will easily reach 700 in due time."
A very up day in the pipelines today
"Looks tired at this level. I sold the other day and missed the last 10 points, but I think the market is really behind this inflation rhetoric. I am expecting an increase in sellers and shorts, repeatedly driving this lower. I don’t want to get caught in the downdraft. Good luck longs. U have a stronger stomach than I. Bullish turned bearish."

The lawmakers have been negotiating a compromise measure to address the issue in the face of mounting Chinese chip production and shortages affecting car makers and other U.S. industries, the authors says. The funding is expected to be included in a bill the Senate intends to take up next week on funding basic U.S. and advanced technology research, the authors note.

"Oppenheimer's 700 price target doesn't at all impress me. (18 months from now, I expect Nvidia to be significantly higher than 700. That's only a 16% increase in current share price.)From IBD, yesterday: ""Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson on Friday reiterated his outperform rating on Nvidia stock with a 12-month price target of 640.On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer maintained his outperform rating on Nvidia stock with a 12- to 18-month price target of 700.He sees upside in the first quarter from video games and cryptocurrency. But a tight supply will limit that sales upside potential, Schafer said in his note to clients. He expects supply constraints to persist to the end of the year.""I think what is said on the conf call concerning chip availability for this current qtr and this current year will go a long way in determining immediate stock price. I think chip availability will to some extent limit their growth. ...Sure am looking forward to this: ""NVIDIA is deploying a shared revenue model for its autonomous driving platform. For instance, its partnership with Mercedes-Benz -- which will be deploying NVIDIA's systems across its entire fleet beginning in 2024 -- is based on a 50-50 revenue share model that will help both companies generate recurring revenue by way of software upgrades and additional feature upgrades that customers buy or subscribe to."""

Check my brilliance this morning: I said @ $609.87 “if NVDA doesn’t trade $589 today I will never post again.”
The $intc PPS collapsing now on fake hyped $nvda news on ARM servers is nothing. Next week it's going back to under $30s. But it shows how the markets were pumping Intel with this kind of trigger to be enough to bust the balloon!
"China doesn't want ARM to be sold to the U.S. U.k doesn't want ARM to be sold, QCOM, Apple and others don't want ARM to be sold. IT WON'T BE SOLD. The $2 Billion upfront was a kickback to Softbank nothing more."
Just scrolling here and realizing the amd fanbois are more comitted to nvidia's new releases than to amd's thingies.I consider this as a good sign. Maybe that's because the most exciting things amd does is new pc chipsets and cpu's. I will liquidate my amd position just before or after its er.
Under $500 in 3 trading days at this rate

"Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.John Stuart Mill(Welcome to the liberal, Orwellian Ministry of Truth)."

How’s your $299 short position looking Kevin?
The quarterly results for technology will come pouring in and you will notice the whole tech sector rise sharply and NVIDIA is headed to new heights. If you can’t get that through your thick skull  then may the Almighty JESUS (GOD) help you.
Quaretely results out soon and what will happen? Yo don't need a degree in physics to answer that? It will go up. the whole technology sector will rise sharply and don't tell me I did not tell yo.

And we crossed $565 like it never went down.....go long 
You only pay capital gains tax if you sell. For the long term buy and hold person like me it does not make any difference and actually it brings stability to the market
"last night I dreamt that Nvidia reached $1,200 and split 6:1 It was a great dream . Thanko"

I am new to this fine forum with such fine upstanding people. Does anyone think  this stonk called Nvidia ticker symbol NVDA could possibly one day hit $575? I see it was $614+ recently. Did they warn? Why did it crash  $160 in a week?
"Well, if we're going to sink, it's nice to know that the rest of the market went with us."
WS trying hard to sell you all the overhyped NVDA at $539.67 and buy all your undervalued AMD for $73........
Why is the short spam on this stock so crazy? Multiple accounts screaming about it tanking every hour. Yet it doesn't. Some big institution paying spam farms to drive this down?I was able to buy in during the dip. These waves are pretty awesome.

"Nvidia assumed with Overweight from Sector Weight with a $700 price target at KeyBancKeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded Nvidia to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $700 price target after assuming coverage of the name. The analyst believes Nvidia is best positioned to monetize ""one of the fastest and highest value add workloads"" in the data center, artificial intelligence and machine learning. With its scale advantage, Nvidia has the resources to build or acquire all the assets necessary to meaningfully monetize the entire data center stack including both hardware and software, Vinh tells investors in a research note. He believes the company's software is creating a ""dominant position"" in artificial intelligence."

"serious question guys, why would NVIDIA try and limit the amount of etheruem that can be mined with their graphic cards, do they not realize that the reason the stock went from $200 to $600 is because of mining? are they putting gamers ahead of the companys profit? anyone have an insite on this? it feels like a terrible business move"

We’re headed north from here folks!
I told everyone here “inner loin” NVDA $610.14 everyone jumped on it around the world ASAP immediately
I will bet anyone in here NVDA makes a new 52 week low in the spring time
"STOCK IS WAY OVERVALUED ,SHOULD BE AROUND $70-80, ALREADY 8 TIMES OVERVALUED."
Looks like a positive day closing for the markets in general and nvidia in particular
First we take 650 and then we take 700. Where's Jon btw?
"The power of return on your investments =had you invested $1,000 with Warren Buffett in 1959 you would be worth over $70 millions today because his average return has been 23.9% year after year. So invest and stay long and fully invested"
this is holding in GREEN today... all the others are in RED including $TSLA
Dow up 400 total bubble market wait until the crash  NVDA will be under $300 and soon 
Inner Loin II $560 short I am 107 for 107 for calling INNER LOINS (falls on average $30 immediately after INNER LOIN(
It is reasonable to say with utmost confidence that the market will turn positive soon. Don’t forget a positive Friday always manifest itself to a following week positive. Also money both foreign and local pouring into the market . Also chip shortages and $56 billions to be invested to expand manufacturing in the United States and finally expect great results from NVIDIA which are due to be released very soon
Even LRCX is up $30 today! Hey  longs remember when NVDA partnered with NIO? NIO was $66 that day! Look  now: $29 LOL nice partnership
"Back to $500 and then to $400, $300 and so on and so forth."
How is this “only” down $22 today and “3” in after hours/what do you guess tomorrow down $100????
Make it to 700 tomorrow and announce 1 to 7. Split

The ship has been righted as expected. Hopefully no one here jumped ship during the two weeks of rough seas. The vessel is sturdy and captain Jensen is seasoned and steady at the helm.
Just think!! Why would someone buy at all time highs right now? . SELL take your profits then enter again on a Dip 
9 days before the call all aboard
Could be a huge gainer Wednesday after hours. Brilliant CEO. Don't bet against him!

They always ignore whats going on in the market in general and just want to spread FUD .I guess time will tell but I say to stay strong Longs we will be rewarded in the coming days/ months and beyond."

550 550 550 maybe today??
Kevin loves filling gaps so we filled the one at 520. Now it's time to fill the huge one at 615.
Look at NVDA's chart. It looks primed for a run at the upper end of the Bollinger Bands. We could be near or past ATH by end of week depending how tech earnings go.
$643? HUH? Just sell and short here and buy it back at $400 like last month so easy
@Darth Trader where are you???
NVDA will 100% be red at some point today anyone want to bet me???
"On Jan 2020 4Q ER, AMD has stated getting double digits servers market share, i.e. 10% goal set a couple years earlier. Since then, no new number was cited.The last ER showed more than double revenues on EPYC servers.This means AMD has now 20% servers market share! This matches $intc 20% decline in servers revenues! But it's going higher! Kisa Su said Rome still the majority of revenues, only in Q3 Milan will cross to have most servers revenues though Rome still selling all the year!Given 50% single number guidance of yearly revenues gain, the servers market share could reach 30% in 4Q...! WOWNeedles to say, 4Q is strongest Q that could see $5B+ revenues! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? It was all said at yesterday's ER just connect the dots!$intc will further decline by 4Q expect losing HALF their servers market share! AMD said new cDNA 2 coming in 2H , that will take away $nvda datacenters business! Do your deep due diligence, read carefully AMD's transcript and analysts Q&A.. fundamental changes have happened. Inflection point."
"Definitely breaking out. Check 1 year chart, (wannabe) shorties."
I heard about NVDA the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
How did the 5 for 1 split workout for TSLA? Asking for a friend NVDA R.I.P.
"Let’s play the new GAME: HOW MUCH DOWN AT THE OPEN? I say down $15 to $555, at the highest! BTW, anyone remember last time it was here Baird fake upgrade $800 PT to get clients out"
You all own a stonk down $20 at least twice a week on huge volume and no news before earnings yet you continue to hold & say it’s going higher. All TARDS
"LOL @ $nvda - ARM bubble bursted, that's why hype ARM server Grace in 2-3 years was announced! ExpectnVidia's balloon deflation very fast while AMD rises especially after the ER!

"yo did not end positive today but don't worry be happy. positive for the week be happy. soon the tech sector will declare quarter and WOW! we will never see $635 again till we split at sayeth $1,000 . Ladies and Gentlemen chips running the whole world. Name a product, instrument, weapon system , vehicle, food production, technology, water management, hospitals, and etc. and etc. all run and monitored by ""the chip"". One day man will be inserted with chip to foretell diseases and diagnostics and prescriptions and what not. In summarization look at the far and above horizon and yo see unlimited vastness."
"Today after reading the regulation involved in the intervention I don't believe it will be stopped. Right now big tech is being attacked by governments all over. Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and others though just keep making new highs and trending higher. So I look at this as a buying opportunity and in fact NVDA even received an several upgrades recently as a result of there guidance and quarterly earnings."
NVDA rumor of the day and why it crashed is the ARM deal is officially terminated! Hope you all read the Seeking Alpha article I sent earlier real negative when the stock was $576
Its flashing a buy signs. Actually the whole market is flashing a buying signal. You cannot see it because you are blind
Won’t rebound today BOYS closing down $50 just watch any bets????

"Raymond James recently Upgrades NVIDIA (NVDA) to Strong-Buy; Conviction in Both Short and Long Term.I agree $1k percent without any resistance, what will get the share there at a flicker of a light switch is a complete confirmation of NVIDIA's acquisition of Arm Holdings.

"Nvidia is such a beast. We are entering the age of AI and the digital age. every city will become a 'smart' city and the implementation of AI will be HUGE.

Wow! what a start to recovery. Get as many as you can. Won't stay at this price for long.
Gonna beat next earnings and raise... and have upgrades. All you need to know.
"New to this forum and investing in general. Been holding onto NVIDIA since last September and loving it. What's the best outlet for most recent news regarding NVIDIA? I see some people posting about how the ARM acquisition has been cleared in the US, but can't find any articles on it."
NVDA is a distrupctive company and not for a weak heart and weak mind people. Buy in bip!! Longs will be rewarded tremendously!!
Ladies & Gentlemen boys & germs the answer was 11:26am EST in the game of WHAT TIME RED? From up $13+ to RED! Anyone INNER LOIN 559? Be honest
I bought more just because Tevin says not to 
"Hi Messy Tummy... just wanted to update the ""ticket"". BA +47%, NVDA -2%. You are such a genius!"
I would not be surprised if Nvidia goes up by $100 next week . Not surprised at all
"If NVDA beats their already known raised great earnings the stonk could hit $600, BUT if there are any slight hints of slowdowns it’s going back to $299"
Hey  it’s dropping like something soaking sopping wet  what can it be? Any guesses? 
Market to support and celebrate Joe’s 100 days in WH
Every last penny of the 10 announcements on INVESTORS DAY plus upping guidance and 20 upgrades is GONE POOF GOODBYE 
Anyone buying the Deeeeeeeeeeeeeep ?
surely dearly definitely merrily Kevin must have covered by now! He ain't telling nobody none kapput because we thinkit he was wrong. Kevin we miss yo bro must cometh back we need a jolly ol fellow like yo to make us laugh. Thanko dearly.
"Imagine if Bitcoin weren’t $50,000 plus their gaming cards didn’t sell out every second they didn’t blow out every earnings report where would this be? $1$"
How can we get some of dat infrastructure spend?
"pullbacks are normal, atleast you don't get to see NASDAQ run up everyday like it was a few months ago."
There's more posts here today from spammers than actual people watching this stock.
Is Kevin still holding that $463 short position? I hope he covered long time ago!
I tell everyone if you liked NVDA at $650 three days ago you will love sub $600 today
1000 in 2025!!
just think this time in 2023 we will be testing $1700 plus
Patience and faith are great virtues. They also will make one rich.
$AMD gives $NVDA love  by helping them up.. what does $NVDA give AMD... ñada..
Thumbs up if you think nvda's pps will be in the 670's before earnings.
NVDA is splitting because they know its headed to 800 + after earnings release next week.
ICE lake is 15x faster in AI than Nvidia GPU's. WOW.
"Marvel/Inphi approval took 6 months. So let's take a look at the Nvidia/ARM process....september,october,november,december, january,februari,march...I bet the first news on this topic will be out next month. If it's coming from the UK then the shorts better run for cover."
U.S cutting off chinese Super Computer companies. Nvidia supplies chips for these companies.
Nvda 460 to 570 in 2 weeksand the shorts are bragging well I second them so now on to 800 just to make them happier
The end ! $nvda without ARM is a very niche play not even close to $400B market cap! Sell nVidia's quickly and buy AMD.
Does NVDA make a chip that will make me a great singer?
Bidens economy.
I thinkit they got a huge upgrade yesterday. And yes siri bob they deserve it. Yes sir Yes sir. Could pass $600 or more before the endo of this week. Thanko kindly
INTC only down $2 in after hours which means NVDA will be down around $20
"I sold the weekly 600 calls last week around $50 and bought the 600 put options for pennies. How was that multi multi million dollar trade? Why would anyone tie money up in a stock when you can make 10,000% in a week in options??? I honestly don’t get it"
"First day in a while EVERY stock on my “screener” all 100+ of them, are IN DA GREEN...........EXCEPT NVDA down $5+ and dropping like a rock "
"yo guys stay invested and buy more as Nvidia goes to $1,000 soon. Thanko"
INNER LOIN $597 wow  102 for 102. Setting up a newsletter $1000 a month
"There is NO DOUBT that this is a $1,000 stock!! And a lot sooner than people thought!"
Oh man... I just noticed that DF Messy Dummy needs this to have another 3 4:1 splits before it gets back to 650.
Will definitely cross plus $600 today
Buckle up we are flying into $600's from here.
AARK was a better short @ $160 then $110 BUT I agree Cathie Woods I have been making fun of her for 6 months
Undervalued AMD $80.25 with the best products in the market vs Overhyped overvalued NVDA $596.18 with ARM desire. Nice cover for MANIPULATION.
NVDA up 1% WOWOWOW  was $615 about two months ago now $616. #FACTS
NVDA is the king in the Graphics and Compute & Networking space. Buy it and hold it for the next 10 years. Makes a lot of money. End of story.
Huang bashers must leave this board immediately. THE MAN deserves a Nobel Prize.
"10 year going to 2% by May, sell high PE stocks. Take profit."
OMG  lollllooolll $614 OMG  LOL $614 early February $614 now ponzi at its finest
"GRABBING THESE DIP DISCOUNT PRICES IN...NVDA and AABB crypto stocks.."" newschain asia broadband ""@@"
TAIPEI (Reuters) -TSMC said on Thursday it plans to invest $100 billion over the next three to increase capacity at its chipmaking plants
Anyone here recall the ARM hoax by management to get the share price higher so they could sell $600+ and buy more yachts 
118k and another 128k in buying in the last hour.......we know what will happen on Thursday........yes
"I'm not completely certain, but I think there is a definite possibility that Jensen is a Soong-type android.....NVDA to $1,000!!"
having the cfo come out today and issue statement about exceeding current estimates across the board for current qtr and the year in every single sector that's huge that will put
holding on to 4/16 calls and greedily wanting morehope for the best
"The Lohr Charitable Fund continues to add to NVDAposition. Matt Lohr, has a target of $755 by Christmas for NVDA."
At $599.99 I said NVDA would hit $299 before $600. Hasn’t had an uptick since! Where are all the $700 PT from last week LOL 
Futures are down but are beginning to show remarkable improvement and at that rate I am sanguine we will end higher today and I keep thrusting this in the short’s faces namely that future is only 1.5% of the daily activity which is nothing compared to the overall picture.
Definitely $875 on a it’s way. More upgrades coming . Upgrades will specific to Nvidia and will also relate to the technology sector.
NVDA is a PONZI SCHEME if you bought last July you are exactly even today
I noticed all the major hedge funds mutual funds & traders reacted to my “inner loin” short @ $610.14 R.I.P. NVDA
I do not understand what the big deal is about this two for one split guys talking about. Net value of the the stocks you own is same. Dividends will likely be halved. Only new investors will think it’s cheaper. But is it really?
610c been tagging .50 base repeatedly today3x gain on 610csweet payback
Upgrades coming soon and lots of them
I guess this is going to 700 BEFORE summer. Not eoy.
Anyone listen to me at $513 INNER LOIN the $600 weekly expiring today pennies now dollars WOW Private jet 
Not near Kevin's trading account page. Can anyone tell me if he got a margin call?
"Longs - don't be fooled! Samsung has scheduled a launching event for Apr 28th officially! This is AMD's designed ARM based rDNA 2 APUs in a laptop! Showing AMD's playing for both ARM and x86 ecosystems with unique cross platform ability, i.e. chiplets design can mix and match within same IO chiplet different CPUs chiplets too, connecting with Infinity Fabric! If you're not technology savvy, take the time to research this deeply as it's a very significant technical advantage to cripling both $nvda and $intc future market shares. Plus adding $xlnx to this is a mind blowing trillion dollars market cap beast with $1000 PPS and $100B revenues in 5 years, as EPS easily gets to $10+ and growth justifies 100X PE!Don't be fooled!"
It seems like it took a whopping 20 minutes or so to to fall to these level from $648
"If NVDA captures 10% of the server market, it will double its earnings. $1000+ in 2022 easily."
weak hands that sold in the $460's last month are crying this evening...now you all know how Trapperkepper feels
What happened to 587.35?
Fake red? we gonna see green tomorrow ?
the twins are turning into tripletspanty boy has alot of emailsif you are new quit while you are ahead
"You were Huanged again, hes playing you like a violin...This is Huang when he was a young fellow"
NVDA only down $50 in April Down $160 in February How about May? Down $200? $300? $400? Take your pick
Thanks Jensen. Congrats on your focus and genius in delivering product after revolutionary product !
Like I said this morning ......bad day to be short. Hehe 
close over $558 i buy a little... close over 575.00 and i buy a little more. would indicate a run at the all time highs.
$558 LOL  literally crying laughing  remember $650?
Wait till the post lunch push to close. Last hour of trading day fully expect 5 million shares traded
"Well it would be nice to be in the 570's/580's just before the first upgrades come in. We can all agree on that, long or short. Not? :p"
"And still, $intc $nvda $mu and Nasdaq red in premarket while AMD is deep green... that should break $84+ today, after a few months of such zigzag moves, towards a new all times high after the ER. .."
Poor option holders...this is why I invest in NVDA and not trade it.
Under $500 right now pre market congratulations  to all of you who bought up $25 on Monday at $535 gap filler
"You wonder why $nvda is announcing a PLAN to develop a server chip basef on ARM NOW? Guess what? Because they KNIW their buying of ARM WON'T HAPPEN WON'T BE APPROVED! So to mitigate the disaster that's coming they shift the target again. Otherwise this is very bad timing before regulators are to approve the ARM deal, to compete with own chips with everyone else. Won't happen! So nVidia knows ARM buying isn't approved! Expect nVidia's PPS to collapse!"
"Sell before earnings. All stocks go down after earnings. look at LRCX, NFLX...Intel will crash tomorrow."
See the little jumpy now with AMD in contrast with the timbbbbberrrr for $nvda and $intc ? LOL
4 for 1 split
closing in on a new 52 week high
I would be ecstatic for it to reach near $600 tomorrow.
Early February NVDA was $615Where is it today nearly May?Ponzi scheme
"@ $599.99 I posted go back and read NVDA would hit $490 before $600, ONE PENNY AWAY and couldn’t make it LOLLLLLL lol "
I can live with today's price action but I bet the shorts won't.
$666 next base and we start moving today!
Someone do a safety check on Kyle.
"So Nvidia got upgraded and Intel downgraded, huh!? Finally, someone gets it. Not bad Chris Caso. Not bad at all. You nailed it.""Raymond James analyst Chris Caso downgraded Intel to Underperform from Market Perform, reflecting the risk that Intel won't reach its goals under new leadership, and also the pain they will likely endure in pursuit of that goal in terms of capex, lost market share, and a shifting landscape in datacenter that will make the industry less dependent on Intel. Caso is concerned that demand in the PC market, on which Intel remains highly dependent, has been significantly pulled forward due to the pandemic, and expects an eventual mean reversion, which may occur just as Intel needs to ramp investment, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The analyst is also ""skeptical"" about the foundry business.""""Raymond James analyst Chris Caso upgraded Nvidia to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $750, up from $700, reflecting conviction in both the short- and long-term. In the short-term, Caso thinks results will be more dependent on supply than demand given widespread shortages, and thinks improvement in enterprise, driven by a return to the office as well as the A10 launch, could drive better Datacenter growth in 2H, the analyst tells investors in a research note. In the long-term, Caso says Nvidia's success in AI has earned them a permanent seat at the table in both hyperscale and enterprise compute."""
With a 50% increase in short interest in the past 15 days NVDA has fallen from $650 to $590 with no bottom in sight right before earnings. You think  someone knows something?
Everyone ready for the opening bell .......

@ SalamanderDaLoser Lucky you up after hours. You love Green. It’s going to rain Green on NVDA for you. Get ready.
"MMs bringing the price down to let big players buy back the calls they sold, before Jensen's talks at the ER?"
"Up over 150 points in a good month or so, unchanged today, shorts gloating.... Seriously? Ha!"
Soaring again pre-market. Wish I added even more shares.
OMG  NVDA up a penny in after hours! WHAT TIME  RED tomorrow????
"Buy and hold and you will not have to pay capital gains tax. This is actually good for the market. Granted some funds have to rebalance their portfolio during the course of the year but that probably happens only at the end of each quarter. Also 401k and 403b plans could be exempt from this. Also he needs congress approval from both houses which would be hard to get. Finally don’t forget had you and I invested just $1,000 with Warren Buffett in 1959 we would be worth over $70 millions based upon his average return of over 23% yearly. So buy and hold and hold and buy and reinvest dividends and other distributions and you will do great."
Just imagine the TARDS who bought $598 on Friday when I INNER LOIN $597! Don’t you guys watch my Inner Loin shorts? I have given out 102 of them and all 102 have crashed
Could see $688 this week. Thanko
NVDA $615 to $463 in MarchNVDA $650 to $560 and no bottom in April/MaySell in May and go away
Maybe get some upgrades tomorrow.
Everything has reversed but this crime scene....$800?? 
NVDA will be down $20 minimum today it’s over longs R.I.P.
"NVDA has a temporary supplier problem. Their chips are in such high demand and they can't get some of their products finished and out fast enough, especially in the newest AI and Geospatial segments. Their management has been clear on this and the data backs them. When their suppliers get back up to full speed, they will make another huge growth spurt. Sales and demand are up. Analysts and investors see this. $800 is conservative when you look 6 to 12 months out. Unless you are a professional daytrader, just relax on NVDA's day to day action and ignore the noise. If you want or need immediate gratifucation, place your bets elsewhere."
"One of those days when rats try to spread panic. To not pay a higher tax rate, wont ppl like to hold long term, hence moving monies to solid big techs, Nvda being one of them?? Think beyond the headlines!!!"
Longs: Just reach into your fake bank  accounts sitting in all cash and buy more NVDA for the 100th time in the past year! LOL  losers
nice buy in low 540's sweet
Sell overhyped Nvidia $626.54 and run run run to buy undervalued AMD. Do your own DD and win.
I am raising my price target from $4 to $5 per share. I am not too late am I?
freedom got all aboard the looney bin
"I’ve made 16 INNER LOIN short calls in NVDA this year, all 16 would have made you 1000% plus if you bought weekly put options"

"Yep, not complaining here and more to come...https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-performance-president-biden-100-days-best-75-years-2021-4-1030346645?utm_campaign=browser_notification&utm_source=desktop"
ALWAYS the late day selloff. But no manipulation 
I predict a series of Upgrades coming within one to two weeks. The price target will be raised to $985 by some of the rating agencies
"I have to laugh at these pedantic shorts. If the stock goes down on low volume they act like it is indicative of the future. Meanwhile the stock is up like 100% over the course of the year. Longs here have made 1000x the return of shorts. When I see losers like Darth Trader, it just smells of desperation. The longs here have made enough $$$ to buy your father."
Only 3 weekly closes higher than today’s. Another 4% would take care of all of those. Happy Friday for the Green Team!
My reinvested shares are now worth more than my original total investment! Think of that and then go switch all of your holdings to automatically reinvest the dividends!
$615 February 2021$589 July 2020$600 today for sure May 2021Any questions?
"Just finished a Babba Conference. Jumbo Babba wants to buy more. He thinkit tomorrow we cross $610 and then $700 by next Friday and he sayeth $1,000 cometh soon and then may be may a split."
African American to be the expected nomination under the Republican Ticket in 2024.
NVDA has been relentless in its upward climb as well it should be. Onwards to 600———> and then we really take off! 
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56906145
My prediction for today : drop at open followed by a mid morning reversal to the point it turns green. Then shorts will drive it down during the afternoon and it will reverse again in last hour of trading to finish slightly down to the low of yesterday
Great way to close the week. Nice recovery on Friday set the momentum for Monday. Happy Friday!! Have a good weekend to all bulls
My last INNER LOIN short position advice newsletter was back in early February when NVDA  was $615. Went to $463. In two weeks. This INNER LOIN was $610.14 should go to $299 by May. Save this brilliance.
"What time RED? Wow, imagine if the stock wasn’t down $100 in a week and they didn’t get a $800 PT today?"
Closed green while both $intc and $nvda deep red with a very low volume of 28M only! Very clear ....AMD tomorrow approval of the Xilinx merger. ..expect new all times high soon.
"Retails buy, insiders sell. let's see what happened"
so proud of nvidia. Came back fast and furious and yes siri bob tomorrow will be a mightly up day. Thanko.
"$589 or BUST tomorrow need to make a “milly” for the Derby  Saturday which I will be there live on Millionaires Row look  for me on NBC, I am usually on tv  every year. Need this  NVDA  to hit $589 by tomorrow, Friday at the latest."
So much for Barf Trader and the moron brigade that guaranteed a drop of $100 today ! I am not seeing them around today for some reason !! Wonder why ?
While close to 90% have beat expectations so far companies such as Boeing are still kind of struggling as evidenced by their quarterly report this morning. On the other hand Technology is booming such as the chip sector and Nvidia and they will continue to boom as the 7.5 billion people are connected more and more to the internet and even intranet and as we explore outer space while making our living more comfortable on this great planet of ours thanks to Technology. Now if somebody does not understand what I just said then GOD(JESUS) help him/her.
It seems like it was just yesterday..I bought my first 100 shares of NVDA.Jensen Huang was selling graphic cards out of the trunk of his Datsun back in those days. I didn't know what the fff a graphic card was back then....but I sure am glad I held those shares.
Jensen is starting to look like Einstein with his longer hair...
"Ladies & Gentlemen, boys & germs  let’s give a big heart  felt welcome  to our little friend called WHAT TIME RED!"
"think salamander works for GS.Please research which company made over $230 millions betting on ""the fear index"" an"
nice little dip
How do I mute Tevin? These postings of his don’t belong on a message board for actual investors.
Thoughts on Intel's 20 billion foundry investment1. Intel's foundry strategy was already pointed out by Jensen Huang nearly 8 years ago： https://www.forbes.com/sites/briancaulfield/2012/03/22/nvidia-intel-should-let-us-build-chips-in-its-factories/?sh=46a0258e539c2. Intel's plan to license x86 is preparing for the post-Nvidia/ARM world. It strengthens Nvidia's argument for acquiring ARM by providing customers more choices.
"First upgrade in and activision crushed earnings, up 6% ah. Nice cocktail, shorts. Enjoy."
Is there any curiosity why they announced this today vs announcing a split during the post earnings conference call??
I demand an answer right now! NOW! WHAT TIME RED ?
AMD ER was a precursor to NVDA’s pending ER blockbuster next month. AMD is nothing more than a noisy neighbor. NVDA is King 
"AMD’s answer to the competition, a fake 4B share buyback… weak!!! Imagine if Jen bought back shares instead of mellanox."
No offense to anyone BUT why wouldn’t UK  allow NVDA to buy ARM for a huge bloated sum $40b when they were so quick to sell it off to SoftBank a few years ago for much less? Why is it suddenly now such a concern?
anyone see a split this year at 800?
Looks like Little Dottie ‘.’ has finished cleaning the trailer park dog run.
NVDA will be $555 by Friday at the high end; then what will Cramer say??????
Amd down on nvidia news yet nvidia will continue to use amd chips for their data center and products until 2023 Time to load up on both before earnings $nvda
Do you think it will continue to slide or get a pop tomorrow
"""AMD’s CEO gives us hope that GPU and CPU shortages will soon improveBy Darren Allan about 2 hours ago""The $nvda and $intc free lunch is soon over. The AMD's GPUs and CPUs supply considerably to increase. No longer need to buy inferior Intel's and nVidia's products. AMD will supply all the great demand! Expect nVidia's ER outlook to be bad as well as Intel's sales. Search for above article."
Same NVDA longs here bought $615 in February sold $463 and bought back $648+ last week LOL 
Is NVDA going to split??
"Best in class products, best ceo on earth, best growth chip stock, best road map for AI in the entire world. long and strong "
Bye Bye Bernie! No tears here.
Just shorted $580.14INNER LOINS Watch & learn how it’s done
The bus is leaving the station
"ARM's ARM9 upgrade to take on Intel by 40% performance advantage - Electronic Times article - LinkThe ""Total Compute"" PackageFor the last half decade, Arm has improved the performance of its Cortex-A CPUs annually at a rate that has outpaced the industry, giving it a foothold in areas dominated by Intel.Last year, Apple replaced Intel CPUs in its Mac lineup in favor of its internally-designed Arm-based M1 system-on-a-chip (SoC). The move came after more than a decade of using its A-series chips in its iPhone and iPad. Amazon is also deploying its Arm-based Graviton CPUs in data centers, which it said offers a 40% performance uplift for cloud services over Intel CPUs."
"Really like the company but paying 357 billion for 5 billion in profits seems a bit steep. That's about 1.5% return in profits. How many people if they had 357 billion to buy this company would do that. Most are just going along for the ride. You could buy Intel for 277 billion, that's 100 billion less and pocket 25 billion in profits, that's five times more profits. Makes you wonder what people are thinking."
Kevin's predictions have been so bad lately that he made a call last Friday when the market was closed and he couldn't even get that right.
Still $649? Still $575? LOL  R.I.P.  Maybe the easiest short ever in stock market history
My guess is they do the same thing they did to apple when it split. Run it up big time until the split happens then it will do nothing for months after that
Kevin who ? :)
There $570 gap down filled now on her way to $457 after earnings save this brilliance
"I just read AMD's CC script, and Lisa Su stated: ""And we’ve been working very closely with our supply chain partners. And so, we also have good visibility to additional supply as we go throughout the year...We have seen improvements that have led to the improved full year guide."" <-- Her announcing this was huge, I think.They increased their full year revenue guidance from 39 to 50% growth, as they see enough supply to do so. I think investors loved hearing that.So far, NVIDIA (CFO Colette) has gone on record stating, ""We believe we will have sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond Q1..."" I am concerned as to whether NVIDIA will have sufficient supply to meet their ever expanding revenue goals in Q's 2 and 3. During NVIDIA's CC, that topic will most certainly need to be addressed. Critical information.Also, I did read that AMD is able to charge more for their chips since there is a shortage."
I honestly change my mind NVDA won’t be down $10 to $20 for the 6th time since last Thursday I bet only down $10 at the most tomorrow nearly down $100 since INVESTOR DAY
"I think these price targets are all too low ILOW,,"
"Had a discussion with a friend who holds AMD and I hold NVDA. Here was my points (EPS last 4 qs): AMD NVDAQ3 .41 2.18Q4 .52 (+27%) 2.91 (+33%) Q1 .52 (0%) 3.10 (+6.70%)Q2 EST .55 (+5.7%) 3.56 (+14.84%)Forward PE-30 Forward PE 39Going into next year, which do you think is ""cheaper"". On a 5 year basis, I'm all in NVDA. Their contract with Daimler doesn't start until 2024. It obvious that NVDA's chips are the most desired and their new GRACE chips are getting them into computing. ARM transaction aside, I really think NVDA in 5 years, based on their current growth is a CHEAP stock even at $600."
Cathie Woods of ARKK dumped all her NVDA around $645. Think she knew something?
I says buy into the semi conductor sector whether yo buy greats such as Nvidia or a Mutual Fund with Nvidia as a major holding. WOW!

Taking over the world.

Anyone like the fake $800 price target  by the worst chip analyst who ever lived?
Who is this “Kevin” that everyone speaks so highly of? He the one calling for the $463 “gap” inner loin?
Nvidia going after Intel markets going up up up up up
The earnings of Nvidia are highly constrained by the chip shortage (the products are practically impossible to buy). This is unlike companies like MU or TSM that also have higher operating costs when they build new factories. I think Nvidia is primed to earn from investments into increasing chip production bandwidth like few other companies.
Today’s math lesson:$650 - $580 = WHAT IS YOUR LOSS in a week? Please respond bag  holders
"Simple explanation on chip “supply constraints.” If you can’t get your chips made, you can’t sell them. No different than no demand. You can’t sell what you can’t produce. And, the gaming chips selling on the secondary market are not making NVDA one penny extra, they are making the “broker” a fortune!"

This suggests we're just at the beginning. Let the weekend help things sink in. Monday and Tuesday trend will continue with a bigger jump on Wen for both stocks. $nvda could sink Wen too depending whar is said at the ER. I still have not see the $xlnx ER datem strange .. joint ER with AMD to declare mergerbwas approved by the regulators? This is the only event I can think of that requires joint event at the same time for the obvious reasons. Samsung unpack Wednesday will poir oil on the fire.Sorts don't know what's soon going to happen they are boiling frogs. Cooked it will be too late to jump then.Have a great weekend all, enjoy!"
NVDA now IN DA RED for 2021Congrats all who gave up their 20% gains
"While Rosneblatt’s Hans Mosesmann counts CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote as “impressive in a multitude of AI, HPC, Cloud, Edge, 5G, Industrial, and Automotive areas,” the 5-star analyst thinks Wall Street might still be reeling from Nvidia’s progress and its intention to move into Intel and AMD territory.“It may take time for the Street to fully grasp what is going on, but make no mistake that Nvidia is again disrupting the AI/ acceleration markets in a way to keep pace with AI model complexity doubling every 2.5 months,” Mosesmann said. “The takeaway is that Nvidia is serious about CPUs and will not be constrained by x86 owned by Intel and AMD. The level of platform innovation is mind boggling and something that silicon competitors will be tasked to match for many, many years to come... Mosesmann rates NVDA shares a Buy along with a $700 price target."
"Good luck to everyone still holding. The sell order on my 550 calls got filled around 610. I wanted to wait longer but my time values are tanking so I locked in profits. Maybe if it pulls back I get in again. If it takes out the high, I think it could have an initial target around 675."
Longs we're about to get very rich it seems. Let us be nice to the bashers including from $nvda and $intc MBs and the shorts and paid posters. They are people too and we can afford to be nice to them now... but it's up to them we cannot force the horse to drink just present the due diligence for otgers to start doing their own... big news in a week my friends!
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA! GOT ALL THE MAINTENANCE WORK FINISHED ON MY 61' BERTRAM AND SHE'S READY TO HEAD TO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. GOING TO SAN MIGUEL TO DO SOME FISHING FOR BARN DOOR HALIBUT AND SHALLOW WATER ROCKFISHING THIS WEEKEND FOR A FEW DAYS WITH A BUDDY FROM LA. LIFE IS GOOD MY FRIENDS!

"Bitcoins at $39000... the bubble is collapsing. All those nonsense ""investments"" promoted by social media or shills like Musk will cause major losses to investors. That includes hyped CEOs of $intc and $nvda bloated shares... don't be the last one holding an empty bag, where real growth company like AMD's shares will emerge supreme. Money will get out of hyped valueless holdings into true growth AMD."
NVDA up 3% whole percent again and the longs act like it’s flying what a joke
Cloudfare and nvidia partnering!
LAUNCH HAAAAADouble Top Breakout
1000 tomorrow.
Huge up day today and for the rest of the week
Reuter’s is reporting that top technology companies are getting together and also making a commitment to increase chip production. I would assume mostly in the Good OL USA . News cannot get better than that.
NVDA was a gift yesterday Do Not miss this buying opportunity.Maybe I'll take some cash of the table at 700. Maybe.
Looks like AMD kicked Nvidia But. ARM server? ROTFLOL.
Chip shortage on par with what’s going on with lumber prices! A perfect storm in the making! NVDA will soar with the Eagles!
NVDA $576.00 or Undervalued AMD $82.73
Little Dottie just found Bigfoot… it’s in Her BigMouth!
What’s up with this Tom dude jerking off AMD? You’re on the wrong thread buddy. Ps- not saying amd is bad stock
"Up about $78 next week. No problem no sweat we have earned it largely by our patience, loyalty, being consistent and determined unlike some vying for attention and making a laughing stock of themselves . The attention seekers provide comic relief but after a while it gets monotonous and boring as sand in the  desert"
nvda shot up 125pts in 12 trading daysspiffy
Graphics cards will continue to be in high demand. Great potential in this stock
Could the split be more related to .. possibility only .. NVDA be added to the DOW 30? a price weighted index. Apple’s last split prepped it for DOW inclusion. Just thinking on the message board.
Another reason to BUY MORE SHARES!NVDA is WELL POSITIONED in ALL Business Segments to Excel with or without ARM!ARM is just more icing on the cake!!
The street either need to bring up undervalued AMD to a $250 - $300 or bring down overhyped Nvidia to $350 - $400.......... stock prices has to reflex reality in the market.
"Should you buy Nvidia stock? Here are the key numbers to look at nowMentioned:AMD AVGO INTC NVDA QCOMBy Philip van Doorn Nvidia topped $5 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in the last quarter. Nvidia Corp. is a well-known company to technology enthusiasts and investors alike. If you are considering buying the stock -- or already own it -- this quarterly review of the key metrics can help you with your own research and decisions about the company as an investment. These updates will also include comparisons of results to other major players in the semiconductor space. Keep in mind that no two companies are alike -- even rivals don't compete in every segment. Any investor needs to do their own research to make informed long-term decisions. Where Nvidia fits in Nvidia (NVDA) is the predominant designer of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the critical components of graphics cards used for high-end PC gaming and other graphically intense applications. Its main competitor for GPUs is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), although Intel Corp. (INTC) is working on new products to compete in the space. The actual manufacturing of Nvidia's GPUs is handled by Taiwan Semiconductor Co. Ltd. (2330.TW). Nvidia has also been rapidly increasing its sales of CPUs for data-center processing and making moves to become more competitive in artificial intelligence-related (AI) areas as it waits for regulatory approval of its acquisition of Arm Holdings PLC. Jeremy Owens explains this complicated competition scenario"
"I have been invested in Nvidia for a lot of years now. I was fortunate to get in for $20 a share back in the day. This company is and will remain the Gold Standard to which all others will be measured. The CEO is a legend that has that rare ability to make everyone around him striving to do their best. He created an exciting work environment where every single employee is given a few paid hours to work on anything they want to. This culture is teeming with excitement and innovation. A rare combination rarely defeated, AMD gave it a solid go at the head to head competition route but quickly realized their lead is insurmountable and comfortably found its lane in taking Intel to the land of “obsoletes” I have only sold a few shares since my original purchase. This company never takes a day off or basks in their wins. No, they go right back to work. The ARM deal is done already, they are attached at the hip and their collaboration only makes it more obvious. These two companies together can solve many of the world’s most important problems but it can also predict the next crisis how best to prepare and have a gamelan the same day! I love this company not because of the money I made but because it is a company that will help to cure cancer and every other bad result we or our workplace receive. Prior to Nvidia’s technological advancements bad news was a likely death sentence for the person or the business. Nvidia offers hope!"
Nasdaq is down almost 2% since April 5th. Nvidia is up 2% since April 5th.
Luckily we have the best ceo out there. Just imagine to be long tsla. Lol. Musk= unstable and unpredictable. I bet Jen is not happy with nidia's current price appreciation and he will act accordingly.
Netflix definitely not going to help the Nasdaq tomorrow.
U.S. Government now going to help NVDA buy ARM
NVDA will be $463 easily by June! I will bet anyone any amount of money 
"If WS wants to sell you NVDA at $559.24, they must bring up undervalued AMD from $75.88 to $250s???????????????????????"
Sold some calls in the 620’s and then sold some puts in the 610’s. Should be going much higher as the last run to 615 was before the revised upward guidance and new area to dominate in CPU’s.
"Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $575 from $560 and keeps a Hold rating on the shares. The analyst left the company's investor day ""once again impressed by the pipeline of opportunities."" However, the ""already-hearty valuation metrics"" for the shares ""fully contemplate the richness"" of Nvidia's fundamental outlook."
$463 is now 100%Good trading & good luck to all
"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day!

Thanks shorties. Have a nice day.
NASDAQ up 150 from the open NVDA down $5 during this time; any questions to my firms power? NVDA will never trade higher again with the ARM terrible news  constantly hanging over it R.I.P.
"People are already talking about a split at $1,000 but let’s wait for that till December 2021 and I am sure management will decide then."
It’s ridiculous that NVDA is still cheaper than TSLA. Time to change. :)
$592+ R.I.P. gap filled to the penny and dropped $5 in like one second. $586 ain’t quite $800 now is it gullible bag  holders?
No more shorts but disgruntled amd and intc shareholders. Well if it's some consolation: I have some AMD too and I'm underwhelmed too about its pps action the last month. lol
ARM deal has 0% chance of going through BTW. After I posted the Seeking Alpha terrible article NVDA dropped $20
New ATH in the works on 3 times usual volume. Thank you shorts for adding fuel to our fire.
I said down $30 or I will never post again ! There is $17. $13 more snore 
Thanko common sense all the Babbas held their positions and also bought more. Yes siri bob bought more yesterday. Thanko
very weak drop was expecting much more ...
View anything below $600 as a gift from the Godz.
Still overbought..wait for $550
imagine when arm deal gets finally finished!
Green!!!! Don’t know why they enjoy a down day. They have to rub it in. Pretty sad.
"Now we get to hear Pravda tonight talk about how the rich need to pay their fair share and it's only a tax on the top 1%. Meanwhile, the top 1% will be dragging your entire retirement fund down unless the tax get rejected."
"This time last year I remember selling some of my NVDA shares at $350 thinking it was overvalued? Ha ha, what was I thinking?Still holding many shares long and strong."
WRONG  NVDA average trading volume is 8.10m shares daily today was about 5.5m WAY under normal
at the 470 i started issuing buy calls said it was a no-brainer long entry recall at the 460x pullback lows i gave an immediate target of a 50% retrace that took nvda to 540nvda shot back up and tagged the 50% retrace level at 540and instantly folded back downi stated any sub 500 buy was a buy n hold oppnvda retested 490 and thenBOOM +110pts in 12 trading days
Amazing! AMD + INTEL mkt cap < NVIDIA mkt cap
"NVIDIA needs to stop selling chips and instead become a cloud services company. They would use its idle capacity for cryptocurrency mining. Then its valuation will be much much higher, ultimately exceeding Google, AWS and Microsoft COMBINED. They have the IP and engineering talent to make that happen."
Nvidia's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 35.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.2% over the past 60 days. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2.
Everything is going down especially on good earnings like AMD.I don't know what the hell is wrong with the market and the hatred for tech is huge.AMD 89-78Nvidia 650-593Unacceptable.
"Will congratulate Freedom 6500+ shares from 614 to 463 back to 627 and hung in like a champ and bought more. I give him credit! I am the total opposite, I love to short stocks that have run up too far......I trade, he buys and holds......different strategies BUT time it right make a fortune"
This will be the third earnings report in a row where the company blows earnings out of the water with zero traction on stock price due to market conditions. So frustrating.

Holy Batman that 56-inch (3 OLED’s) MBUX Hypresceen from Nvidia looks cool in the new Mercedes EQS (electric S-Class).
Good buy point!
Way to go joe!
"SOXX DOWN 1.43%, NVIDIA DOWN 1.24%. NVIDIA DOWN LESS THAN THE AVERAGE AVERAGE SEMICONDUCTOR STOCK SAME AS YESTERDAY. NVIDIA WILL REBOUND HUGE $35+ ON A 200 POINT UP NASDAQ DAY WHEN THE NASDAQ REBOUNDS."
Earnings mean NADA
So nice  so much improvement. Probably higher by $10 today
I say NVDA falls $50 today! Just watch this. Anyone want to bet? Anyone here holding from $589 last July when the NASDAQ was under 9000?
"I swear on my life we rented a yacht  for $250,000+ for one week excursion PLUS have to pay for fuel, 9 person crew tips, food & drinks.

You guys have no idea how much we have made short NVDA"
AMD is designing infinity connect onto GPUs. Modular construction follows. Visualize a graphics module with eight chips adding up to 1000 square mm of silicon.
"is going to finish green, mark it."
530 monthly is the target with descending pattern.
Where are the analyst upgrades???
Huanged again!
Once again NO volume! Don’t sell!
$666 then $700+ after call
"I knew this was going to pause and take a breather at 650 after the week and a half runup. A number of analysts had a PT of 650 for the past six months (since raised to 700-750), so it's logical it would pause here."
Dow futures up 200+ NVDA RED!!! LOL!  R.I.P. NVDA was $589 last July $589 this morning up 0% in a year! #FACTS
Only $85 to go until Kevin's guaranteed gap fill at $463 by end of week.
I said it last week and down 50 straight dollars NVDA won’t ever trade GREEN ever again. Went down $160 in March I say down $500 by May
"Why is everyone picking on Salamander? He provides entertainment! He is obnoxious!

His friends at his place of worship are angry at him for incorrect advise and I am angry at him because he ceased posting which was a great source of entertainment and glee and chuckle for me. Even my puppy smiled when he saw me laugh. Granted he is not very useful but I rather he make me laugh rather than watching the reruns of Gracho Max, Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges"
Remember at $649 I guaranteed gap at $463 would be filled? Who’s laughing now????
earnings pop round trip. scale buy starts at $550.00 to $525.00 for me.
Anyone see the drop from $611 to $602 in less than 20 seconds? Wait until bad earnings
LOL  CRYING LAUGHING $614! Anyone recall what happened in February when it hit $614? Care to guess? Try $463 in a week!!!!!
"If analysts are right that deal is unlikely, it shouldn't be priced into the stock, and nothing to worry about. If it is, guess the market disagrees with them, huh? Great company regardless."

"People trimming profits after a mega run in both the market and NVDA on a Friday. I took profit on a portion of my position. It's what disciplined investors do after a big run-up like this week. This thing is going to 700 in the run-up to earnings. If ARM closes, $1,000 by year end. This stock is an absolute animal."
Nvidia is a dinosaur chip company that works well with brute force AI algorithms. Soon to be extinct.

NVDA 650 to 550 this week Not bad longs Futures crashing Rioting everywhere by the animals
"nvda is on the precipice of greatness. for those of you not aware, their first RISC ARM CPU is coming in January 2023. it does not matter if ARM deal is killed. it is still coming. if successful, which i have no reason to believe it won't be, nvda will be in a position to start hammering away at the CPU datacenter, taking market share away from INTC and AMD. not only will they be in a position to take market share, but be the first company to offer plug and play AI datacenter products, from CPU to GPU and all software stacks between based on low-power reduced instruction set. the possibilites in this market is quite mind-boggling. story will start unfolding in 2023, but investors with a little vision know that this might be the numero uno tech company in the world come 2024, in market cap and TAM. this is not even mentioning GEForce Now, standalone GPU's, laptops, and PC's. buy, relax, and get wealthy. dollar cost average in. in 5-10 years time, they very well could afford to sling a 3% divy as a cherry on top. that is why it's pricey."

NVDA still very cheap here. As per Zach’s it’s trading at a P/E of 40. The lowest level in a year. The high point was a 77 P/E. So a lot of room. Tomorrow Taiwan Semi comes out with March sales. If as predicted it’s a blowout number NVDA should fly (along with Apple). News just keeps getting better 
MU beat on ER...looks like the NVDA train keeps moving on Thursday...sweet
Everyone in NASDAQ buying COIN?
$680 tomorrow for sure
"Recently Bitcoin made a new all-time high, Dodge also has picked up some points and media coverage and Coin is now officially a public company. There are new crypto entries coming to market and Facebook is closing in on Diem now that it is bringing removing its main obstacle and coming to the USA. SpaceX crew dragon has been a massive success and the tech sector has had a well-anticipated pullback and the market has broadened out to some sort of normalcy now that the USA is phasing in the reopening stage. More EOM are talking up EVs and that would entail the necessary infrastructure need for a buildup of charging stations. And AI, 5G, and cloud are ramping up at a much faster pace on the other side of the pandemic. These events and other positive I may have missed bring me to NVDA potentially getting the approval for Arm Holdings very soon and the entire set up since their previous earnings resulting in, a major quarter ahead of it inclusive of the negative semi shortage become a plus for NVDA over the long term when they spell out the forward-looking guidance.I view NVDA as having their biggest pop in the companies history when they report 05/26/21, with a target price of approx. $650+ on the opening of 05/24/21 possibly closing up the same week well above $700+. In order for my comments to play out, all prior events will have become the catalyst for will be all positive at every stake for NVDA. NVDA's CEO and management somewhat assure me that it is possible without any resistance in my view.In the event, $700 before the end of May may well become the minimum and the confirmation of the Arm Holdings acquisition will be the added catalyst for the shares to go right past $1k+. Soon after Jensen and the board may be left to announce alternatives to increase the dividend or buyback shares or a split. The bottom line will be to continue to raise its valuation while at the same time continue to reward the shareholders."

Watching Cramer wax lyrical all over NVDA. Calling it the G.O.A.T. We’ve only just begun amigos. 
"The Street manipulators with all the propaganda to sell you overhyped NVDA at $648s - $580s. Same situation with overvalued Intel, the crooks wants to unload on you retail investors overvalued stocks."
I don't see any comments from shorts as future and nvda both are green.

"Reymond James wrote such a nice article on AMD and Nvidia. Makes you happy and proud. Don’t forget lot of mutual funds have Nvidia as a top/major holding and these mutual funds have a whole team of analysts analyzing companies all the time . And if you look at their educational and experience backgrounds it blows away your mind.

"A group of U.S. senators are on the verge of unleashing a $52-billion proposal to drive the U.S. semiconductor chip production and research over five years to tackle the growing Chinese semiconductor production and crisis impacting the automakers and other U.S. industries Reuters reports.The proposal includes $49.5 billion in emergency added appropriations to fund the chip provisions included in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.The proposal includes $39 billion in production, R&D incentives, and $10.5 billion to implement programs including the National Semiconductor Technology Center, National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program, and other R&D programs, based on the draft summary.U.S. share of semiconductors and microelectronics production plummeted from 37% in 1990 to just 12% at present.The Chinese Communist Party had invested over $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing."

"Remember that TSMC's ER news aren't related to $nvda as mostly they don't use its 7nm fab, they use Samsung 8nm and $intc isn't making yet any 7nm TSMC's fab chips ! It's AMD !"
"Oh boy... so many NEWS over the weekend! Exciting news I don't see anyone posting here common AMD_France lol! Let's start! First we had a leak of a new 6nm Zen3+ Rembrandt coming! This is after rumors of Warhol 6nm Zen3+ being cancelled as a stand alone Ryzen pure CPU. Now let's connect this news to Sony upgraded 6nm Playstation rumors AND a new upgraded X570S motherboard! All leaked recently. What do we get? A powerful new mobile Ryzen coming very soon... to be used as desktop and consoles APUs too, just like the rumored Ryzen 5700G which is a Ryzen mobile chip with higher power and AM4 socket desktop use.So now let's understand that TSMC's 6nm is a more sharply definitely Extreme UV lithograph that is compatible with 7nm designs. 5nm requires complete new masks and designs and of course provides substentially higher improvements. Advantage of the 6nm is ability to CONVERT 7nm fab lines quickly to 6nm by ADDING EUV etching machines. EUV results in sharper lines features, hence can get devices dencer closer to each other with less capacity of the metal lines for example. So higher clock speeds and lower power use are possible. The net is all above links are connected and could result in new laptops launching at Computex Taipei June 1st! Lisa Su Computex opening keynote is a big event to show new products related to Computex. Obviously 6nm Rembrandt is...! Connect the dots... you'll see what is coming. . $100+ EASY! $intc doesn't have an answer, their Tiger kitten cannot even compete with past 7nm chips. ADDITIONAL TSMC fab capacity will prevent Intel selling low end chips at a big discount. Just because AMD's are sold out.$nvda will suffer a blow in the mainstream GPUs line as 12 SPs vs previous 8 with faster clock speeds and Zen3+ integration is all it needs for most people. So something outstanding is cooking and soon to be shown! There's much more - check next post... DON'T BE FOOLED !"
NVDA $615 in February NVDA $463 MarchNVDA $608 now Nice bag holders

Classic break out.. It’s Friday.. expect more upward Monday
Tanking in after hours. Will be down minimum $100-$200 this week. Guaranteed!
Incredible turnaround and finish. Turning around an $18 loss yo $2 gain. Let’s have a great run up into ER in a week 
"Good Morning: Nvidia is set to rise big time. Actually the while chip sector/semi conductor sector is sizzling hot and there are severe shortages. Even Neal Kapputo on Fox Business Report (whom I don’t like because he interrupts guests etc etc ) talked about it at length yesterday on his program. My suggestion buy Nvidia etc etc for the long term because it is headed to $1,000 or buy some great mutual funds such as FSELX=Fidelity Semiconductors and hold them forever. I am sure there are other Family of Funds which offer similar funds too."
Shorting more here $569! Large. And buying more put options. Expire Friday! Cha Ching 
Nvidia uses Brute force algorithms for its chips. Dinosaur company indeed.
Here is to Apple setting us up for Big tech upturn tomorrow!
"Nice, 700 coming up by ER - Given the twice raised ER guidance, big buyers will feel comfortable..."
90% of the returns on stocks are dependent on market direction. NAZ will need to be 16000 for NVDA to hit $1000. As simple as that.
Imagine not getting out when you had the chance
Pattern is in any company that reports no matter how good will tank NFLX TSLA already and wait for NVDA that has never once traded higher no matter how good the earnings SAVE THIS BRILLIANCE
Overbought...earnings are baked in people...dump while you can
"All week, Bloomberg TV was really talking about the semiconductor shortage. NVDA is a favorite of Cramer. He says buy. His net worth has skyrocketed over the past 10 years. NVDA will be going up for a long time."
Show of hands that bought at $615
I still need an extra $972.82 a share before I can sell half :-)One trillion dollars market cap. Approx. $1600 a share. Soon.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
NVDA now lower than before INVESTOR’s DAY when they lied  about increasing earnings & the 10 new products
Will NVDA surpass TSLA today or tomorrow 
Kevin was right all along
Would love to see money rotate out of the DOW back into tech.
Another delicious day for the chipking! 
Will Tesla and Apple split experience happening here! I think 700 is OTW!
Should be a very positive day for Nvidia today . The futures are just a knee jerk reaction to yesterday. See you soon at +$600
bye bye call options...
You guys realize that my INNER LOIN short call trades are now 100% and have returned an average of 500%?
My friends did you sell overhyped NVDA $617.61 and buy undervalued AMD $79.58?
NVDA down $80 in a week since my INNER LOIN short! Anyone listen?
"Dropping like a rock... ya, shocker, I know..."
NVDA “down $50” this week LOL up 1000% on my put options You?
Anyone here know what NVDA is dropping like ? Hint: It was $578+ now $571 and dropping fast
$591 is a pretty critical level to hold here.
"China presents its first competitive 7 nm data center GPU. Bad news for NVIDIA and AMD.However, the Big Island GPU might see global availability if the claims regarding its floating point performance prove to be true. Tianshu Zhixin revealed that the FP16 performance of the Big Island chips can reach 147 TFLOPS, which is comparable to AMD’s Instinct MI100 with 184.6 TFLOPS, but clearly cannot match Nvidia's A100 with 312 TFLOPS. If China keeps up like this on the performance side and also offers aggressive price schemes, we could be seeing some decent alternatives to the U.S. models in just a few years from now."
Let’s play the BAG  holder remembrance game: Who is old enough to remember $649? $615 in February? $589 last July 2020? $610 this morning?

Is Kalpesh Dancing?
Is a pattern of lower lows and lower highs good? Asking for a friend
$616 end of the day today
green means silent time for the triplets in lingerie
I told you’s when NVDA was $620 that the short interest rose 51% in the past 15 days into earnings season so someone knows something is really bad
Going under $600 today 100%My 600 weekly puts up 1000%

made over 100k in nvda back in 2018. sold a little tsla and pltr this morning to start another position at 597.00x125. semiconductors aren't going anywhere and nvda is #1
It is a shame that Nvidia does little to no business with Apple. Apple is on fire;• $89.58 billion versus $77.3 billion expected• Earnings per share: $1.40 versus $0.99 expected• iPhone revenue: $47.9 billion versus $41.5 billion expected• iPad revenue: $7.8 billion versus $5.6 billion expected• Mac revenue: $9.1 billion versus $6.8 billion expectedOh wait a minute!? Apple uses Arm. Who owns Arm? Very very soon Nvidia ;-)
NVDA 589 July 2020NVDA 615 February 2021NVDA R.I.P.
9 days to GTC21 and many tech earnings coming up. Perfect setup.
"I was a Debbie Downer a few days back. Finally a split. The psychological effect of the lower price will push it up; both prior to the split, and after. Maybe it reaches 680 prior to split, and an initial 20% surge after the split from 170 (if pre split is 680), to 205."
Close Flat. Up at least $25 Thursday and again on Friday. Wont stop until near $700. After earning my take it tops around $850 all within a month. 50% gain from here within 6 weeks
"Nvidia may cross $625 next week, $650 before earnings...no going back from here"
Ladies & Gentlemen boys & germs  what time  red? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. Largest short position we ever had at my firm in 30 years going into earnings INNER LOIN
NVDA $557+ to $550 in less than 1 minute! Imagine when they warn for Q2 next earnings in a week? You had all better be hedged
we will be $600 next week
Bye bye  $600 forever! NVDA won’t ever see $600+ ever again! Gap @ $463
STOCK SPLITTING: Did everyone notice in the voting proxy materials that NVDA is increasing the number of authorized shares from 2 billion to 4 billion? Isn't this effectively a 2 for 1 stock split coming soon?
I still say the ARM deal is rejected and NVDA falls $100 one morning watch and learn and always carry put options
toms hardware has Intel's response to Nvidia Arm server. ICE lake 15 times faster than Nvidia GPU's.
"At $648 when NVDA raised fake guidance so insiders could sell stock and buy 10 more mansions, you were all touting $700. WHAT HAPPENED?"
"Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $650 from $600 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The biggest news of yesterday's event was the launch of the Grace ARM CPU, ""adding a third chip platform to the story,"" Curtis tells investors in a research note. Nvidia also now expects to exceed its April guidance, adds the analyst. He believes the company is ""impressively pushing ahead with a scale that is unmatched within the semi universe."""
NVDA will be a 5G powerhouse a $13 Trillion dollar market. KeyBank put a $700 price target around our neck. We’re going higher amigos 
Not one person in here congrats  me on my INTC call around $40 now $70 funny how that works NVDA R.I.P. WHAT TIME  RED????
@Salamander. Good day for you!! Start covering LOL.
NVDA down $20 today at some point just has gone too far too fast. $614 in February to $640 in April. HUGE move!
RIP MARIO THE CLUELESS BAGHOLDER LMFAO

its either up 20 or down 20 again
Look for a Stock Split at the June 2nd Meeting?LONG!HOLD!
"Hey  longs: Time to reach into your endless supply of money  to “buy the dip” LOL  Today is the end, NVDA is now under its 200 day moving average, which means down 50% from $550 by June"
AMD red LOL.
"C'mon guys, I know I scrawled up. No need to go into further details. It's gone , finito. I see a great chance in graphcore. Who buys the first shares with me? Another game another chance."
I predict big upgrades starting Monday morning
Still benefit to Tsmc to make chip for nvda
Watch the futures turn tonight from red to green. Might be biggest up day in history on Thursday. NAS plus 500 maybe? Going to break one way or other and my take is UP BIG!
Up she goes sweetie pie. Could be up $10 today. Thanko
Still cheap.. wake me up when $750+ 
Market acting like the 25% corporate tax already took effect
"Sure, skip Nvidia. Just like you skipped Google, Apple and Amazon."
$610+ Monday
"Dont be an emotional investor, this is a winner long term."
Business as usual. Carry on 
"On an earnings call with investors, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company’s capital expenditures, which include things like logistics expansion and the costs of data centers, increased a whopping 80% over the trailing 12 months...Guaranteed NVDA got a big slice of that pie..."
"Should have done this years ago when I bought 500 shares of NVDA at $200, but am now adding 100 shares to my 401k. When I retire in 10 years it should be worth a couple hundred thousand dollars! I'm estimating $5,000 per share."
What a gift today
Futures are higher. Tomorrow will be a greatly fantastic day.

Congrats to the longs who held through all this. I had to punch because my call options are rapidly approaching expiration. I should have bought further out on expiration.
"If you have your proxy yet take note of Item 4, ""Approval of an amendment to our charter to increase the number of shares of common stock from 2 billion shares to 4 billion shares."" Given the shares outstanding is less than 650 million now and that should the ARM deal close it would require only an additional 44.3 million or so shares it suggests NVDA is opening the door to stock split in the near future. I would define near future as next two to four quarters. The amendment doesn't necessarily mean a split would occur only that the path is being cleared for such a possible action."
Just shorted another 1000 @ 557.75. This game is easy! Cover $457 after earnings. Good luck to all. Save this brilliance!
Wow ! Coup De Grace to Intel ? The Grace Server ! Hear Hear.
"breakout out on high volume, after several months consolidating."
so you think he pays off losing bets why is he still here So the twins are now gone here is their quote from yesterday $463 by Friday or I never post again in this forum. Save this BRILLIANCE
Would be nice to see $457 after earnings where I have a GOOD TIL CANCEL cover
ARM server? LOL.
"Honestly TARDS, NVDA has dropped $160 in 3 weeks and now $90 in a week, and you hold no put options? Even if you are long, and bought the weekly 600 puts for pennies you could have sold at $50 today up like 100,000% in a week! Beats  working for a living"
"I finally came to the conclusion that brother Kevin alias Tevin alias Levin but could also be Melvin is a former employee of Nvidia who could not perform hence was let go hence and therefore the bitterness, jealousy, envy, disorientation and cracking jokes which he only understands but thinks he is sooooo funny a gift  to mankind and somebody who makes your day when he is around you. I bet Melvin will be real sad to read this and perhaps you will not see him on this board till next week Monday"
Ladies and Gentlemen boys & germs  RED  IS NOW HERE! Congrats  to all who played! Anyone like $576 or $566 now better? Be honest
"Short will be burn tomorrow after afternoon sessions, it's a pattern. Market will open lower and go higher Nvidia up 2% tomorrow"

You all like this TARD in the White House  I hope anyone who voted for him has 50% less money in their accounts this year.

"I’m been saying for years NVDA = Stock Royalty. On par with my three other Titans.......Apple, MSFT and Amazon. No longer the big three It’s the fabulous four. Hehe "
Longs looks like NVDA going knock the cover off the ball when it comes to earnings! Stock going to take the APPL or FB reaction? Sell Calls or Buy Puts?
Price increase on Nvidia products are increases to the bottom line. Load the boat folks
800 by end of June.Yeah that’s right. All you naked shorties gotta burn and produce shares for the split. Is gonna suck for you.
"Down just $3.10 and the arrow was pointing in an upward direction. In other words the directional tendency was upward bound. Had we another hour we would have definitely ended higher between $6 to $14. So let’s analyze tomorrow and the rest of the week. Let’s look at alpha, beta and the mix. My conclusion it will be up tomorrow and each of the days during this week. And we all know next week (before and after the earnings) will be great. If the earnings are at the tail end of next week then the momentum will continue in the week following the next week. Upgrades coming too . A whole bunch of them. You will upgrade valuation as high as $850"
NVDA will be under $600 this morning! Anyone want to bet me?
"I'm thinking peak, retest $275, then drift up into the low 300's and sit there for a few years.Word."

"""Only China is likely to have a significant issue with this merger. Chinese companies have a significant interest in Arm technology. It weaves through much of what the country is doing in everything from smartphones to automobiles.China would undoubtedly prefer that a Chinese company make the acquisition. But this would be problematic for the rest of the world on many different levels. It's important to note, though, that China will likely be appeased by the fact that Arm China, a subsidiary of Arm, guarantees them access to the technology. U.S. export controls won't extend to Arm because most of their IP was created in the UK (Arm is a UK technology powerhouse).Finally, architectural licensees in China don't need to worry because an ISA and an architectural license's benefits, unlike chips, can't be cut-off."""

"The only reason NVDA remained stationary for so long was due to the pending ARM acquisition. Yahoo Bears and shorts interpreted the pause as NVDA topping out permanently. Clearly the latest upward movement shows NVDA still has plenty of fuel to roar higher. To wit, their decision to make their own server microprocessors is a major blow to the shorts’ thesis. If they land ARM on top of that shorts are sitting ducks for the slaughterhouse. Betting against a name like this over the long haul is like lighting a match during a gas leak. It’s not a question of if you will get burned but how badly. As long as Jensen Huang remains the CEO this sky is the limit. I of course am expecting thumbs down from ignorant shorts but if they really want to hurt me they have to cause NVDA to fall all the way back to my cost basis of $63. Chances of that happening are even less likely than winning the lottery. This company has given pocket change to shorts."

A gorgeous day for NVDA longs! Not so much for the AMD fan girls.

Those who think nVidia's Grace is a datacenter server CPU - wrong! As usual $nvda is full of hype. Grace is just a GPU with few ARM cores integrated to do light tasks locally. No general purpose datacenters CPUs here. GPUs cannot be used for all workloads. They are accelerators only for specific narrow applications.

"This is the first time Nvidia is turning to a rental model for DGX Stations. The idea is to broaden AI adoption for enterprise IT departments that need to support the work of teams in multiple locations or to help academic and research institutions, which often have to grant outside organizations access to their computers. DGX Stations start at $149,000, while the DGX SuperPod starts at $7 million and scales to $60 million. https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/12/nvidia-unveils-rental-model-for-dgx-superpod-mini-supercomputers/"
After the next earnings report the PE Ratio is going to drop big time which will bring even more investors!
remember what the triplets wrote yesterdayIf NVDA doesn’t go under $600 today I will NEVER post ever again in my life! SAVE THIS BRILLIANCE & trade accordinglyand this liar wants you to bet him LMAO
great concern no word from the tripletsare they hospitalized in intensive care
"i bought at 525 and sold at 575 :( highly regret this.now, funds from my savings to my investor account has been lingering in a transfer for over 5 days. nvidia is climbing without me. oh, I feel sad :("
We reached and crossed the resistance level at $600. The next level of resistance will be at $800 and till then NVIDIA is non stoppable
"BTW I bought $30,000 worth of the weekly $550 put options when NVDA was over $575 yesterday morning, for pennies, will be $50 by Friday easily, I will pocket over $2m cash  it’s not a hard game people"

get ready for a big day
"Removed my sell order of 633. decided that this morning's news did not come from out of the blue, and that it was no surprise to the big players."
"the drive by bashers are getting ready to be wiped out...I mean: gtc was 2 weeks ago and they still know nothing, lol."
Remember $nvda has a lot of its GPUs revenues tied to crypto. Collapsing crypto means nVidia's ER outlook will show revenues decline. ..
"Tomorrow, it looks like we are going to gain 3-4%. It was a great opportunity to get few stocks at this price. Wishing you all longs goodnight"
this is weak and will close red before day ends.
Kevin opens his Deluded Mouth once again to take a Left ....Right...Left...COVER KO!!!
It's gonna finish the week at 525 because I have an option straddle and that's the only place I make no money.

"I'm long and see Nvidia surpassing 700 by New Year's. In spite of Nasdaq's volatility, which appears to affect everything. Hang in there and ride."
NVDA R.I.P. LOOOOOOLLL $607Omg  down 10% in 4 days Is it $700 yet? LOOOLLLLWas $615 months ago $589 a year ago #FACTS
"$NVDA seem to always come out with some ""unicorn news"" during $AMD and $INTC quiet periods. Shame on them."
"Jensen Huang is definitely pushing the envelope of AI, super computing, and robotics. His focus is all about computing SPEED. Re-establishing the definition for accelerated computing."
I noticed NVDA is in the new ARKX ETF. That makes me happy.
Very nice resistance yesterday. Some great write ups. An excellent day building up today . Anybody who can live without an I-phone etc please raise your hand. I counted “zero raised hands”. And chips run the I-phones etc. We also call them semiconductors. In olden days cells or tubes and they were as tall as your ceiling and you needed four of them to do just your basic calculations. Today we can carry a chip in the palm of our hand and it does thousands if not millions of functions. I will just say WOW  to end this
Just shorted 1000 shares $614 what an absolute mortal lock ! Going back to $463 like last month
"Great price to load up, end of year will double up as it always does"
new all time high just minutes away
I think some of us are jealous of Salamander with his raw talents and an ability to be wrong 100% of the time. He may be short and chubby but he has held us at bay. Other short people I know of or read were Napoleon and Tod the son of one of our greatest presidents Mr. Lincoln.
nvda will not be down 50 today
Any update on server chip? I see potato chips served on paper plates.
Market up big time next week! Why? Because of chip shortages and NVDA and the whole sector is well positioned. Two month end contribution to 401k and 403b plans and pension funds and IRA and Koech plans etc billions upon billions of dollars will be invested into the market and third Mr. B plans to raise capital gains tax is being opposed tooth and bail even by powerful Ds such as Joe Michini and finally the Ds will lose the House in the midterms or at least it will become more of a 50:50 ratio which will become harder to pass any bills so I predict no new taxes or just a nominal amount
4 for 1 split few days before earning release signals the blow out earning coming soon. It would be foolish to cash out and lock in the profit now.
Ladies & Germs  boys & girls NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite WHAT TIME RED ????
"Let’s play a new version of WHAT TIME RED  let’s call it WHAT TIME $589? I say by NOON . What do you say? $589 is where this pig was last July 2020! When she does, the “weekly’s” are up 1000% for me. Cha Ching  for Louisville via private jet  tomorrow am"
"What a GORGEOUS DAY --- oops... sorry, meant to post that on the BA board. Mr. Calhoun! Now THERE'S a guy that knows how to run a company! Not like this JERKSEN fella..."
Nvidia mounted counter attack and ended higher close to $2.00 nice performance. I am expecting it to be much much higher by the close of business tomorrow
"$605 on zero volume AND was $615 in early February AND, get this, was $589 last July."
Did anyone believe me at $648 when I told them there was a gap at $463 that had to be filled?
$1000 in near term
Good day. Sending the shorts back to wendy's!
tennis court got power washed early this week and got all spruced up for springblooms that ring the court going bonks beautiful weather outside going to 80+ later this week
Testing last week's low and holding above. Just added another 100 shares at $598.
"Could be be down $50 today under $500? I see a new 52 week low after earnings. NVDA under all her 10, 20, 50 & 200 day moving averages"
Huanged once again
"Watch that gap closely @ $463. It should hit there by Friday. I am never wrong, ever."
So we may get to 700 or 800 pre split then split somewhere in the 150-200 range
"If you are a long term investor for God’s sake relax and stay invested. In my 44 years of investing I shorted, I bought puts, I traded on margins, I bought MMs I bought gold I traded derivatives and ALWAYS LOST. It has always been hearsay “a friend of a friend his grandfather made money”. Well I did not but actually lost and my spouse threatened to leave me . Now I buy great companies such as Nvidia etc and also invest with Fidelity Mutual Funds such as FSELX (semi conductors) etc etc and I have never been happier. You can also try other family of funds. They research for you and invest for you and you merely select the sector you like . Folks that is my story. Stay long and stay fully invested. Thank you respectfully"
$655 tomorrow
Gap up tomorrow. going to break 52 week high
July 2020 NVDA was $589May 2021 NVDA is $593What’s that gain? My checking account paid more!
550 soon
When I shorted Friday at $573 didn’t think it would hit $557 so quickly
A great period is in front of us . Have patience
"time to face the music. This will not breach 630 before earnings; will be fortunate to hot 600. After earnings, another drawback. Better luck next quarter."
NVDA May 7 650 call options I sold two weeks ago for $30 are worth 0.15 and I won’t cover yet LOL  zero or nothing
"Listen to Jereme Siegel a great smart man with a PhD from MIT and a professor at a top notch school. Also listen to Warren Buffett ( how I wish I could turn back the block )the best investor in the whole wide world. If you invested $1,000 with him in 1959 you would be worth over 72 millions now. Don’t listen to the brokerage houses and analysts. One famous brokerage house declared bankruptcy during Obama time and Obama bailed them out. That same brokerage house made 230 millions in one day betting on the fear index . And when you bet on the fear index what do you do? Dummy what kind of question is that. Dummy you increase the fear index by causing more fear dummy . Next time ask harder questions dummy."
"SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 12, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced at its annual Investor Day that first quarter revenue for fiscal 2022 is tracking above its previously provided outlook, with outperformance in each of its market platforms.“While our fiscal 2022 first quarter is not yet complete, Q1 total revenue is tracking above the $5.30 billion outlook provided during our fiscal year-end earnings call. We are experiencing broad-based strength, with all our market platforms driving upside to our initial outlook,” said Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer of NVIDIA.“Within Data Center we have good visibility, and we expect another strong year. Industries are increasingly using AI to improve their products and services. We expect this will lead to increased consumption of our platform through cloud service providers, resulting in more purchases as we go through the year. Our EGX platform has strong momentum, and we expect this will drive increased revenue from enterprise and edge computing deployments in the second half of the year.“Overall demand remains very strong and continues to exceed supply while our channel inventories remain quite lean. We expect demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year. We believe we will have sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond Q1,” she continued.NVIDIA’s market platforms include Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. The company also raised its first-quarter revenue estimate for its new CMP product for industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining to $150 million, up from $50 million previously expected.In its Feb. 24 earnings release, NVIDIA had provided a revenue outlook for its first fiscal quarter, ending May 2, of $5.30 billion, plus or minus 2 percent."

"HPC Server market is about $40+B strong and growing at 7.5% per annumThe global high performance computing market size was valued at USD 39.1 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% from 2020 to 2027. The growing need for high-efficiency computing, continued diversification, and expansion of the IT industry, advances in virtualization, and rising preference for hybrid High Performance Computing (HPC) solutions are some of the factors expected to fuel the growth of the market. The ability of HPC systems to process large volumes of data at higher speeds is prompting government agencies, defense agencies, academic institutions, energy companies, and utilities to adopt HPC systems, which also bodes well for the growth of the HPC market."
$578 at the close. green day!

will nicely come back by this afternoon. Thanko
"Don't be fooled. ..Remember AMD's PPS will go up, while $nvda and $intc are way over valued. They have no 50%+ growth this year as AMD's guided just flat or negative growth! Why pay bloated PPS for nVidia at 100X PE when its future given crypto bubble busting is iffy at best and AMD is unleashing a Zen3+ with 12 GPUs CUs Ryzen APU for desktop and mobile?! This will capture most of nVidia's market leaving them the high end crypto mining $2500+ GPUs that won't provide revenues growth! Don't be fooled! Intel's Paper Target cannot match AMD's... end of story. Yes, Intel's PPS to drop to $40 and lower based on the analysts downgrades Hans Mosesmann including!"

the ark funds hold 247 million bucks of nvda... i just checked..

"HPC Server market for Grace is huge - $49B in 2025""Global Forecast to 2025"", published by MarketsandMarkets, the HPC market size is expected to grow from USD 37.8 billion in 2020 to USD 49.4 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period.The demand for HPC is driven by the increasing need for efficient computing, enhanced scalability, and reliable storage, emerging need for the high-speed data processing with accuracy, adoption of HPC in the cloud."
"Nvidia $598.04, news desire to built ARM server are used to manipulate the herd to sell undervalued AMD at $78.99?"
"rammer,, it will look cheap next year? looks cheap now after that presentation to me"
"Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $675 from $665 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said tis positive preannouncement provided a bullish outlook on gaming and datacenter, an expanding revenue pipeline to $8B, and upside to margins and free cash flow."
"Imagine buying a stonk $615 it crashes to $463 in 2 weeks somehow they have fake Investors Day earnings and news stonk rallies above that $615 a gift from god, and you don’t sell!!!!!!! LOLLLLLL"
So after a year of begging for a stock split a 580 stock announces a surprise 4 for 1 split and it goes up 13 LOOOOOOOLLLLLOOOOOOOOLLL
INTC all time highs almost $70 was $42 recently when I begged pleaded for you all to buy
"Bought another 10 shares yesterday at $550 for my 401k. This is fun!! Do I care what the price is today, or tomorrow or next Friday?!? NO! I'm thinking long term and NVDA will make me rich. So stop stressing out. Go get some take-out Chinese food and think about how wealthy NVDA will make you down the road!"
Anyone heed my INNER LOIN advice? $615 to $463 last time I guaranteed it
we're my bears at? I was told this is going to 140 on Monday?
350 350 350 maybe today
16.8 billion stockholders equity.. current market cap... 373 billion.. what the f are you guys buying....
Nvidia pe is sky high. Only speculation and dreams. It's so high because people worship this Huang guy
This PE is way to high..wait for this dog to come down before buying..it will
NVDA will never ever see $600 again after this week so act accordingly ONLY down $50 since Monday (so far) fell $160 in March
$568 or better today
are you guys gonna buy MICROVISION?
NVDA love
This PIG  falls $20 a day from its highs like clockwork and ends everyday exactly at the lows the same pattern from 615 to 463. We are 650 to $590 so it has another $100 to fall to drop $160 again
"Will be very interesting how the conference call after earnings goes in respect to bitcoin. If it is something that ultimately collapses, the guess will be how long before it does, and its effect on Nvidia."
"quick reminder, I still believe it's possible...happy with 645 before er too btw...""Mario aka dos7 days ago$NVDA conversationThumbs up if you think nvda's pps will be in the 670's before earnings."""
great news indeed...https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade
I am literally addicted to shorting NVDA 4 new short positions initiated today on the stock from $592 to $581 and I have bought the weekly 580 put options 7x already today!!!
NVDA = the Intel and AMD slayer. 
High PE stocks like this will be extra vulnerable throughout the summer.
"Volume was 3x when buyers were pushing this up to $640 but NOW that it is wayyyy cheap...no volume? See, peeps like to waste their money! I bought another lot today."
"You own a STONK in NVDA that will never ever go up ever in your lives literally EVER & the sooner you all realize that and SHORT $553, the better and more relaxed  you will ultimately be."
Good time to buy or nah?
$570 at the close.
I say NVDA -$100 today! Anyone want to bet me??? I will bet any amount
Thanks Jensen! Finally the split!! Should now run to $700 by split date!
"usa has the highest percentage of working-age, able-bodied adults claiming govt disability for life than any other country in the history of the worldfar higher than even the most liberal european countries in the '70's when they had all-encompassing social safety nets. at the time, everyone claimed a disability, was free money for doing nothing. drug and alcohol abuse shot thru the roof, crime increased. people sat around all day getting wasted all day. european countries had their reckoning with their swollen disability rolls, they could no longer pay for iteuropean countries severely curtailed their disability rolls, the free ride was over. social commentators at the time gravely predicted riots and huge spikes in crime as a resultthe exact opposite occurred. people had to go back to work, drug and alcohol abuse declined. productivity shot thru the roof. same thing is now happening in usaat some point, america must have its dead reckoning moment with the total explosion in govt disability programsssi/ssdi and military disability rolls have absolutely shot thru the roof most of them are working-age, able-bodied adults looking for the golden ticket to be declared 'unfit for work' pulling a check for life is the goalthis absolutely enda total abomination that has totally haywirewhen even liberal media do searing exposes of the total explosion of disability rolls in america, that's a sign the trolls on this and other boards are ssi/ssdi chronics pssing their empty days away the internet has become the default babysitter for 10's of millions of bored, lazy, shiftless lazy phkups"

"NVDA gets the best of the best in their recruiting of talent. No wonder they're doing so well, on top of all their technicals.Surveying the latest hires (latest 12 months) of NVDA, INTC, and AMD:1. Question: Did you interview at least two of these companies? Yes2. INTC/AMD hires: Did you also get offer from NVDA? No.3. If you had received an NVDA offer, would you have taken it? Yes, in a heart beat.4. NVDA hires: Did you also get offer(s) from one of the other two? Yes. Decision to go NVDA was a no-brainer.Conclusion: NVDA is the preferred go-to for the best of the best candidates."
We're going to get a rally next month. Bank on it. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-taiwan-february-export-orders-084132482.html
The valuation of NVDA is insane now
NVDA still $592? LOL  downward gap filled beautifully to the penny and down $10 R.I.P.
Is there any doubt that mankind is on a path to merge with machines with NVDA chips?
"No Tom since the opening bell. Because we're up more than amd, folks."
"Forbes Merger Bullet... (and I agree).“Any potential bidder will be seen as a threat because Arm must be a strategic acquisition. The problem lies with the fact Arm, a tech company, is attempting to be neutral. Being neutral does not work in a competitive industry.The governments reviewing the acquisition will likely consider Nvidia an excellent candidate to push forward their agendas for AI and edge computing. Nvidia has proven itself as a GPU-leader in the data center with 98% of cloud infrastructure-as-a-service using Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPU). There needs to a similar, ubiquitous approach for trillions of edge devices, where more AI-decisions will be made.Therefore, I predict there is a stronger chance that the Nvidia-Arm deal goes through than what the critics believe.This is because the governments reviewing the acquisition will need AI to power their economies. Competition is healthy for the tech market, yet moving forward as an ecosystem owner is also paramount. You cannot block innovation at its most crucial point and I believe Nvidia is best equipped to deliver AI to devices for future development.”"
"As you can see, AMD's PPS climbing back but $intc and $nvda deep into the red."
"I said ""Longs should relax and trust Jensen"". I think I made the right call?"
I am invested in #amd and #nvda. Nvda growth 600% while amd got 1000%.. dunno while amd stockholders complain
Friday late day tank gonna happen!!!!! Never fails
This stock is simply gold for shorting. Everyday another chance to short and you longs still hold it for dear life LMFAO

Jenhsun Huang is genius :)Musk is a con man :(
That’s what I’m talking about! C’mon $600
I can feel 100% NVDA will be RED by the close and $578 will be more of a distant memory than $614
Intel ICElake 15x faster than Nvidia GPU's. Nvidia will soon be extinct.
"Not surprisingly, Nvidia Corp. used its GPU Technology Conference last week to announce updates to what it’s doing in the areas of artificial intelligence, supercomputing and autonomous vehicles. But the 2021 version of GTC had a new twist: a much stronger enterprise focus than ever before...The opportunity for Nvidia has been created by the evolution of the data center. The fundamental tenet of my research has always been that opportunities are created from markets transition and the data center is on the precipice of major change. During his keynote, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang (pictured) called the data center the “new unit of computing,” which is a topic I’ve written about for several years now...https://siliconangle.com/2021/04/20/nvidia-flexes-enterprise-muscle-gtc-2021-conference/"
since march 2020 covid panic lowsi pounded the table to buy nvda as a true long-term buy n hold for true long-term buy n hold investors was my top pickand top holding
This stonk NVDA is SO over priced here at $559. Sell short and buy back under $400
Imagine the earnings if NVDA sold their cards on their own platform without the scalpers like they used to. I'm not buying mine till I can buy from an actual retailer. 6 months and no cards because of scalpers has to be affecting corporate decisions at this point.
will not be hearing much from the tripletsthey soiled their lingerie diapers and the home has locked them down as punishment
Remember the open $592 I guaranteed down $30 and you ALL laughed? Remember?
NVDA still $592 after the Baird $800 price target ???
"Huang: ARM and Nvidia are independently and separately excellent businesses, as you know well. We will continue to have excellent separate businesses as we go through this process. However, together we can do many things, and I’ll come back to that. To the beginning of your question, I’m very confident that the regulators will see the wisdom of the transaction. It will provide a surge of innovation. It will create new options for the marketplace. It will allow ARM to be expanded into markets that otherwise are difficult for them to reach themselves. Like many of the partnerships I announced, those are all things bringing AI to the ARM ecosystem, bringing Nvidia’s accelerated computing platform to the ARM ecosystem — it’s something only we and a bunch of computing companies working together can do. The regulators will see the wisdom of it, and our discussions with them are as expected and constructive. I’m confident that we’ll still get the deal done in 2022, which is when we expected it in the first place, about 18 months. https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/17/jensen-huang-interview-from-the-grace-cpu-to-engineers-metaverse-of-the-omniverse/"

"Jensen already said the quarter will be great and also lifted guidance. Can’t overthink these things. Put your feet up on your desk, light up a stogie, pour yourself a lovely spiced Rum and enjoy the scenery. "
This is your 55 min. warning.
could end the day higher. Definitely an upward momentum. If you have the money listen to me for JESUS sake and buy.
Anyone old enough in here to remember NVDA over $600? Me neither

"""Relax longs"" - I told you so last month.... Best."
Slowly slowly the market is turning positive. Also don’t forget more and more people are employed and going back to work as evidenced by huge demand for houses. With that goes more electronic equipments and with that a huge demand for semiconductors. It’s all connected Dr.  Spock

"Why do overseas and foreigners invest in the Great United States  market? A very simple question? For security, stability and a reliable and consistent return.

And our own investments such as 401k/403b, IRA, Koch plans, pension funds , tuition plans etc etc . No wonder Charles Schwab and Fidelity see an uptick in new accounts and investments.

I 100% guarantee NVDA never trades over $500 again ever after this week Any takers?
Crossing 600 and now on to 700 in a short time.
Ha ha ha... this will be over $770 in three months
Picked up another 5 shares at $552 for my 401k! Buy on dips and hold for a long time and NVDA will make you rich!!!

kevin/devin are genius no doubt about it but capital gain tax does not apply to me and all the Babbas because we only buy for the long term. Moreover the whole market is down. Thanko
Look at the split like thisNvidia wasn’t doing much lately The split will be a new adventure
"They want 5 Billion more, the right people will be paid and the deal goes thru.lol"
Drops $20 as easy as other companies drop $2
"Had to go away on Thursday didn’t have access to stock quotes, is NVDA over $648 yet? How about $700?"
retested yesterday's closing highs and instantly came back downbummer
Red AH!!!?
Would not be at all surprised to see this hit $1000 this summer.
"We're gonna need a bigger boat, boys..."
FreeDUMB this look  familiar ————————>
Now we just need the stock to split!
This winner is up over 35% from its recent lows. What a buying opportunity back then.
"Huge, bearish, engulfing candlestick on heavy volume for AMD today- no bueno for them."
Raise your hand if you are in at $650? LOL 
What happened to 573?
be a very very up day today
NVDA was $460 when the ARM deal was announced so it should drop about $200 from recent highs
"If everything is so good for the SEMI industry, why was AMD selling for $2 and NVDA for $30 in 2015-2016 ?"
Will NVDA ever see 600 again?
Nvda just ate intels and amd’s LUNCH.
Buy now and you'll be in when we cross $600...and then $700!
who said the current up move projected to 640 -650?you're welcomebeen doing this for far too many yearsa somewhat graceful exit yesterday on front week call optionsbut i didn't whole heartedly back up with a hurried exit at test of 640
Buying & holding an incredibly overpriced stock like NVDA @ $650 is NOT investing and won’t ever make you rich  buying put options every week for a year has made me over $10m
"Pure Beast Mode! Breathtaking moves last few days. Next comes the mouthwatering climb to $700. Apart from the Cryptos, the hottest name in the market. Jensen = Pure Genius "
it's looking like Nvidia is going to close this arms deal by July
AMD and Intel getting crushed. The savvy ones have jumped shipped and come aboard a winner. Smart move and Bienvenidos!
$600 buyers all bought $614 last time and panic sold $463
"Go back and read my INNER LOIN short @ $587.50 the 580 weekly put options were near $0 now $10. My INNER LOIN shorts in NVDA are now 101 for 101, average return 1000%"
Greed never leads to anything positive
6.77 Million NVDA shares shorted as of March 15. Painful day for Shorts!!!
So stock split somehow makes the company more valuable? Can we say 1999! What a farce.
look at apple and Amazon. it's been 9 months sideways!!!!!!
"$600 tomorrow, oversold+ big upgrade."
"50-day MA broke pre-market, if it holds it's all the way back to 600, then 700 and 800 end of april, to the moon, let's gooooooo!!!(oh and shorties i have one word for you: BURN)"
"Nice recovery of 2.5% in second session, it will go higher and cross $610 end of this week."
I just 4X bb!
You may want to take some of your profits and buy some SAVA. Only Alzheimer's Drug to reverse memory lose and improve Aggression in patients and the improvement keeps improving. You could have 13 shares for 1 here. It's up 500% this year alone and has climbed from 36.50 to 52 this week alone. The returns are huge.
Anybody else have a feeling that the “bell at the top” is ringing.
"Hey Kevin, what time today will NVDA turn red? What happened to Darth Dummy, and Dot Boy? Perhaps their out stealing hub caps off moving cars to pay for their crack habit?"
I would be completely un-surprised if Nvidia ends April 2021 at plus $750. Not surprised at all. If mom was alive (RIP my dear beautiful gorgeous kind sacrificing unselfish mom) I would recommend Nvidia to her.
I will be like a kid on Christmas  Eve trying to sleep  tonight for I see NVDA down $100 one day this week. SAVE THIS BRILLIANCE
going RED
RED AF by 6:45am according to my ML model.
had a nice 1pm hour-long rally back to retest hodneed a 2pm to close ramp to bust thru be nice i think this can continue higher on it's expansion move on immediate term but that's far from a given hope for the best
"Anybody still buyng here ? I shorted at $605, cover at $575. Hopefully today."
Not ANOTHER opening bell dive? What’s that make? 6-7 THOUSAND now? 
"Last time NVDA fell under its 10 & 20 day moving averages, it crashed another $130 over the next few weeks"
"prices reaching higher and higher, hope this is sustainable"
"Lesson 1: Remember, BASHERS NEVER BASH A BAD STOCK."
"I sayeth with utmost confidence in 12 months from now nvidia will be at $1,236. What sayeth yo guys. The babbas namely my friend all agree."
oh ya another green day
"yo bro Kevin bud it went up and soon will go to $1,000. This morning yo not soundy soundy very happy. Now listeen to Babba (that's me) this babe going to $1,000 so please be goody good and cover yo short positions or go away disappear kapput because ain't nobody listeening to yo. Thanko"
its either up 20 or down 20
"Private school called, Kevin's check bounced."
Anyone here want to bet me? I say NVDA hits $399 before $600! Any takers? A matter of fact I 100% guarantee it!
Is NVDA still +$9? Had to take a leak and walked away from the screen @ $609+
To borrow a phrase “ my inner loins feeling good” 
Sun comes up and this drops $15 BWAHAHAHA . Tomorrow is Tuesday. Good enough reason for it to drop another $20 
Did NVDA just warn? wow will be down $20 by the close minimum maybe $50 here comes $463 gap by May
Money is coming back into Nasdaq and S&P in a big big way
"Advanced Micro, Microsoft and Google come out with results today after market close. Market will rocket to the sky tomorrow. Yo might as well buy more today into the tech sector including NVIDIA."
Microsoft and Google will declare their quarter today . Watch the market rocket to the sky tomorrow
I think it’ll go to at least 630 EOTW. What do you guys think ?
This stock has enormous interest because of its unlimited growth prospects.
Told ya $614 NVDA = death  sentence down $2 in after hours R.I.P.

"The horizon new landscape for digitization, AI, DC has undervalued AMD writings all over........ New modern secure products at 7nm. You know AMD CEO is the keynote for Computex 2021."

We'll see $725/share by labor day. Get in and enjoy the ride.
Omg  LOL $563 to $555 in literally one second! This stonk is going to $299 soon 
Big m and a deals being squashed like $nvda today w arm thats why growing small and mid caps are always the way to go especially when on panic sale like this $nndm $ostk $bngo $ride $ gevo
My order to buy at $519 never got filled. This stock is so manipulated. Huang should resign.
"Jensen takes it to the next level. Would like to see $600 today, but I sense the short people will consider cutting their losses."
"Economist: America's boom time has begun - LinkThe latest monthly employment report, published on April 2nd, painted an impressive picture: over the previous month America created more than 900,000 jobs. That figure, the strongest since August, reflects the state of the economy in the first half of March, when the surveys took place. But a look at “high-frequency” economic data for more recent weeks, on everything from daily restaurant diners to Google-search behaviour, suggests that, since then, the recovery has if anything accelerated further. America’s post-lockdown boom has begun."
Wave  a long heartfelt goodbye to $600 forever! Amazing anyone is long from $649! R.I.P.

If you say this is getting ahead of itself it really isn’t. This was close to 600 last august and had been consolidating for awhile and just had a great earnings report and dropped over 100 points with the tech sell off so this is due
Desperation is posting every few minutes about the same thing with nothing new to offer=Tevin

"$250,000 yacht  1 weekJuly 5 bedrooms Crew of 9Can’t wait  On NVDA longs dime Swear"
Its over for Nvidia. They had their 15 mins of fame. Xe-HPG is just around the corner.
Longs have set the momentum today. As mentioned before. It looks like a nice recovery and all time high week for $nvda
@ $599.99 I guaranteed my life on it NVDA would trade $299 before $600; How was that call ?
Well it was a good way to end the week! See all of you on Monday for more action
When Tesla announced 5 to 1 splits. The stock went almost straight up by 80%. It would be interesting how NVDA does next couple weeks after the 4 to 1 splits announcement.

"Come on mvda should be around 700 right now , all world  needs your chips"
"For security reasons? Who is the UK's closest ally? Oh yeah, the US."
Overbought big time...this stock should pull back under 550..
"NVDA only has to rise $100 to break even from last week LOL  what is $650 to $560, try 15% loss in a week"
OUch! the capital gains news not being taken well. I wish those taxes were tiered for how much money you make in total - leaving room for the retail retired folks on the bottom.
"Anyone want to bet me? I will bet any amount up to $5,000,000. NVDA hits $463 before $620."

May be his $250k yacht got grounded or may be he got a margin call . Poor fella if you left this world then RIP! I have tears in my eyes when I say that.
I told you 550 was coming..stop listening to some of these clueless bingos on here that want you to buy high..wait for the sell off like this
4 for 1 stock split. A recent upgrade. Wait until this chip shortage gets resolved. This will go from 100 to 150 fast
I would reference Salamisandwich Johnson as a Carnival Barker His strongest suit is that he doesn't let truth or integrity get in the way of a good story.
glad I never sold at all
"sell in may and go away, better sell now at elevated prices and buy back under 500 in june after heavy market correction"
Down $20 from pre market closed at the exact lows of the day......LOOK  no stonk trades down $100 into earnings if they are going to be good
shorts running to get back under the rocks from which they came. lol
Where is Larry the #$%$
people dont get nvidia is #1 semi and splitting.............back the truck up
NVDA and Volvo have a new partnership. NVDA to develop AI for self driving trucks.
Just bought more Nvidia. Intel popped big and the entire semiconductor sector will follow . So simple to understand (1) we cannot live without the semiconductor aka the chip sector (2) more and more universal applications and usage such as expanded usage in the auto sector and satellite and military software etc etc etc (4) a severe shortage of chip so that even the president got involved in setting up new facilities (5) chip shortages in China and other developing countries and we are well ahead in terms of technology and development. WOW
Sold NVDA on Friday for $639 and bought back 500+ sh today at $616. Yeah!
Overhyped overvalued NVDA $625.10 with a promised of chip in 3 years to compete with antique Intel products vs undervalued AMD $ 82.83 the leader with modern superior secure 7nm products you can buy today.
Hello Had it 5 year and just stay in there and it make you some money Oliver
what is with this insane stock value moves? Why buy today at $30 higher then 2 days ago? I'm a happy long but clearly this market is being manipulated by traders. Great trading ranges for options!
"Anyone here old enough to remember when NVDA got upgraded by the worst chip analyst who ever lived, Tristan Gerra of Baird, with the usual bologna $800 price target, and $592+????"
"Million shares in first 10 minutes up $15.50. At pace we could have 40,000,000 share day and up $35 plus but I’ll stick with earlier much more conservative estimate of 24 million shares and plus $25 or so for day..."

I see this little piggy  is down from $614 and fell to $463 and everyone was calling for $800 the whole way down the drain. I will short with 100% margin

The street are desperate ready to sell you overhyped NVDA at $545.20 and BUY all of your undervalued AMD?
What happened to 609?
Could anyone in here even comprehend the total & complete TARD who paid $617 for NVDA this morning? Doesn’t he read my posts?
LMAO nvda will go to 250but you will have 4 times the shares johnson with no johnson
"The $nvda announcement of far future ARM based datacenters server CPU Grace, supposedly, is just to soften the blow from ARM deal not happening. As now we see the UK national security concerns raised. There is no way to announce a CPU made by nVidia's own to compete with all those licensing ARM to make their own CPUs to sell. It's a cartel monopoly case obviously saying such before approval of the ARM deal is bad. But nVidia's gotten word it won't be approved so they announced far into the future Grace.Today trying to soften the UK news nVidia's saying that they still ""expect"" the deal closing ""in 2022"" LOL yes until they get final word they can appeal etc but the chance? ZERO! With Grace it's subzero lol. So nVidia's bubble without ARM has no sustainable business. Others can license ARM too and do datacenters CPUs. Trying to wave the dog through the tail with their GPUs is pathetic. No one is buying it especially as in contrast AMD can do that plus have a same socket and IO chiplet as the x86 EPYC! Here's Jansen typical arrogance hype:https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/72112/nvidia-ceo-huang-very-confident-arm-deal-will-be-approved/"
It is beginning to surge forward similar to Nasdaq and could reach the break even point or may have a gist and tendency to end in the green light area. Brewing well for next month
"Data Center Market Segment Highlights for 2020The data center market is expected to post a year-over-year growth rate of 18.30%.The data center IT infrastructure segment includes server infrastructure, storage infrastructure, SDDC, network infrastructure, converged infrastructure, backup and recovery software, automation software, and data center infrastructure management (DCIM) solutions. The use of such IT infrastructure is increasing owing to the increase in demand for computing power and storage to support the growth in global data traffic.The data center market share growth by the IT infrastructure segment will be faster than the power management system, mechanical construction, general construction, and security solutions segments. The post COVID-19 impact has fast-tracked the demand for IT infrastructure due to the increase in the adoption of cloud services and digitization.Regional Analysis35% of the growth will originate from the North America region.The US is a key market for data centers in North America. Market growth in this region will be faster than the growth of the market in MEA.The increasing adoption of cloud services by enterprises across industries in the US and Canada will facilitate the data center market growth in North America over the forecast period. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-center-market-size-to-cross-over--519-billion-by-2025---technavio-301253991.html"
"LOL - Relax longs, trust Jensen to keep everything and everybody on track..."
Everything up.....NVDA down. Earnings will tank the stock.
"My up $25 for day prediction might prove to be too conservative. Think we get more than a few 25,000 share buys this pm. Everyone will want to be in for earnings. Shake out over big boys be piling in this pm"
Like I said this is pump and dump. It doesnt make sense to be valued 300+ billion when your sales is not even 25b per year #$%$..overvalued the pe is at ath
"if the deal falls apart, it will take at least 50 points off share price"
"ARKX portfolio now has 33,876 shares of Nvda. It’s 11th largest position."
"NVDA now down $5 pre market LOL . Not to sound mean, BUT does anyone know anything in here about options gaps moving averages etc? The stonk gapped down $580 after earnings went to $463. So there was a gap at $580 we all knew would be filled, it did yesterday $579 or so, NOW it’s going to $463 gap after earnings"
"my trading strategy on NVDA, each time it went down 10-12% from the peak, buy it! then wait it goes up 12-15%, sell!. You can do this 3-5 times a year, it always worked nicely for few years and makes me at least 35% of trading profit each year. Much better than holding the bag of stocks."
NVDA still up $10 pre market? I can’t get a quote. ROTFLMFAO  Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to deep dark red lows of the day!
"Let me put it this way... North Carolina has the best BBQ in the United States.NVIDIA is the N.C. BBQ of graphics, AI, datacenters, etc.Everybody else is, I guess you could say, second rate....like Texas style BBQ."

Normal profit taking. no worries
"normal pullback, don't be fooled"
"New ath possible in a good 24h, AMD's er will probably take us higher, nvidia's gpu's are in high demand and the market will make the link imo."
Slowly turning positive. Microsoft just turned positive and the whole market is moving in the positive direction

NVDA down $5 in after hours down $100 more to $490 and I will begin to cover
The new chip production won't start until 2023. The SP is getting ahead a bit fast.

NVDA + $620 = Superman + Kryptonite
so goodi adore this companythey are the real deal
Overvalued!!
"The answer is simple buy, buy, buy undervalued AMD, sell Nvidia. Do your own homework and win big."
Is the PM move news related or just a run-up before earnings?
"TTD beat earnings raised guidance and announced a 10-1 stock split, stock down $200! LOL!"
Will be 1K.. anytime Cathy woods sells a stock it goes up lol

"unlocked: Citi keeps Marvell as top semi equipment pick, Nvidia moves up to two 07:21 MRVL, NVDA, LRCX Citi analyst Atif Malik updated his Semiconductor Equipment and Semiconductors stock rankings and prefers stocks with high exposure to the data center/enterprise demand recovery in the second half of 2021 and low exposure to handsets. He maintains Marvell (MRVL) as his top pick and expects storage demand for new crypto currencies like Chia and enterprise tailwinds to offset China 5G infrastructure delays. The analyst moved Nvidia (NVDA) up to two from four on expectations for an enterprise demand recovery in the second half. Malik moved Lam Research (LRCX) down to four from two saying handsets contribute outsized 30%-40% of the memory bits for semi caps."

"Salamander you are good. You claim you made $10m manipulating us the longs . We the longs toil for our money and put something aside each pay period or monthly like clock work .

Going to fill the gap at $463 before May
"Moving towards positivity Nvidia futures have began to move right aka up depending upon how you look at it. Reymond James wrote highly about it. We are on the move but the  gloomy, doomy and depressed (in the market sense) will always be negative even if God came down with mana and other foods to feed them .

Are you seriously going to invest into such speculations to be left with a bag empty without your hard earned money? Ignore such valueless Wallstreet traps!

My friends brutally undervalued AMD $82.95 with the best products in the market vs NVDA $572.46 or you can buy Intel with antique products and wait 3 years for 7nm.
"Overhyped NVDA $647.14 always goes up before earnings, with a promised might have a chip in 3 years to compete with Intels antique products; competition between antiques products lets see who will win in 3 years."
Like I saidfinishes over 580 today

"Relax longs - Trust Jensen, I say"
Going under $600 today for sure be patient shorts  still going wild over $648 LOL 
"Great news: Associated Press is reporting that Fidelity is now open to younger people (age bracket 13-17) opening an account with them and buy stocks, bonds and mutual funds etc. A great move on the part of such a great institution such as Fidelity. Every night I pinch myself to death  “why didn’t I start investing earlier “. And when I did start being a jackass I was losing money shorting and day trading until I got a kick  on my center of gravity and learnt a lesson and now I buy and hold."
Down $20 down $30 Down $25 down $30 the past 4 days THEN up $20 now IN THE RED! $463 coming soon 
NVDA at one month lows into 2020 cap gains tax selling combined with horrible earnings means R.I.P.

yo guys lower open higher closing. don't worry beit happy. Futures just 1.5% of the market ain't worth too much. Yes siri bob all indicators are down too. That swine Powell should not be on TV so many times during the course of the year. Today we have month end inflows 403b/401k/pension plans/IRA/deferred plans. We had great news from technology so far. GDP grew well. Unemployment down. No inflation. New taxes will not pass that easily. D will lose the House in 2022. On and on it goes. Great news! Fantisto news. All Babba agree. Thanko
"$615 to $490 and all I read is how all the unemployed broke NVDA bag  holders are “buying more”. Sorry, doesn’t work that way"
NVDA now $10 lower than before the $800 PT upgrade lol 
above 600 by end of the week andthe triplets will never post again
Congrats longs!
A coming chip glut will devastate NVDA down to sub $300.
This time will break 400 !! Watch out
You longs do understand if you shorted every open since last July you would have made $2000 x # of shares you shorted
Funny! Missy “LITTLE DOTTIE” was all worked up yesterday when we went a little red but went back hiding after seeing her shadow on the Gorgeous Day!
Up 300% on my weekly 580 put options; this game isn’t hard WILL BE RED BY THE CLOSE we are going to $463
NVDA $615 February 1st to $615 April 27th. What is that return this quarter?
"The bloated $nvda is plumped to bust big time... in a week its ER will have to guide lower. Compare with 50% revenues growth this year AMD has guided to flat or negative growth guided by $intc, including 20%+ decline in its datacenters servers, you will understand why nVidia's is as hyped as crypto. ARM deal will be rejected leaving nVidia's future in a void."
Longs: Question: Did you like $649 last week or $550 today down a HUNDY
"Perhaps Darth Dummy, Dot Boy, and Kevin can tell everybody why they haven't bought any Nvidia yet? Perhaps if they did they wouldn't need to sponge 3 free meals a day from the Salvation Army soup kitchen, dumpster-dive, steal merchandise from donation boxes, and shoplift at Family Dollar, and steal shopping carts from Wal Mart and Target? Please send me the name of your trailer park you reprobates live in and I will send a case of Spam."
NVDA a short trap this morning and right now. Will hit 699 or more on Wednesday on blow out earnings report guidance raise.
Buying a couple shares tomorrow regardless of the price. Just keep adding. One share. Three shares. The key is to just keep adding! NVDA is the stock of the future!
Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said the lines between Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) continue to blur as Nvidia plans to invest heavily to accelerate ARM's proliferation into data center space. The analyst expects a different data center landscape in 2025 as the company announced its DC roadmap at its virtual analyst day this past Monday. Rolland reiterated his Positive rating and $700 price target on Nvidia shares.
Nice Strong Close!
See you at $700 folks
Green.
Just bought more lot more. You can also buy a mutual fund with Nvidia as a major holding such as FSELX from Fidelity. You can never go wrong . Never . Then sit back and relax and let the experts take good care of you
After fake earnings NVDA will $457 anyone want to bet? Shorted FSLY $122. Everyone laughed. $39 now in 2 months! Shorted SPLK $225. Everyone laughed. $113 now. Shorted FROG $90+. Everyone laughed. $30 now
$666 next base all aboard last chance before earnings run up and beyond. nvidia growth is compared to juggernaut running through Styrofoam walls. up up up $3000 2024
I honestly don’t think I have ever shorted a stock like this with all good news that goes down $20 everyday no matter what and if it gaps up it ALWAYS loses it all
"The mentioned CPU [?] will be apparently available in small qty in 2023 to some customers. Give it a year to iron out some problems and start mass production @TSMC [?]. We're taking min 3y before anything happens. Meantime, Intel and AMD could close the ""performance difference"" gap and 10x faster won't apply any longer. 3x to 4x would be more realistic. Still, not bad but, who knows what competitors have up their sleeves. Don't get overexcited yet. Be careful and watch out for pumpers."
"Easy comparation overhyped Nvidia $553.30 vs Undervalued AMD $75.77, the new leader with the best modern secure 7nm products in the market . Today is a great opportunity to load up undervalued stocks for a tremendous discount, do your own HOMEWORK and buy the new leader like there's no tomorrow."
NVDA new lows of the day Congrats to those inner loin 597
"AMD up 10x NVDA, but hey, who's counting?"
$1200 in a few years. don't sell.

"Hey Kevin, I heard the Salvation Army wants all the stuff you stole out of the donation box near your trailer park. They also said no more free meals until everything is returned."

Last time NVDA hit $615 it went to $463 so this time it hit $648 so I figure maybe $300
Nvidia should take advantage of their cheap currency (stock) and buy QCOM here.
$463 gap filled 100%Can’t wait until it crashes there and no one in here says I was right like $504 from $615 easy call
1000 tomorrow. Bank it. 
thanks for the 543. long and strong. run shortie run

Just INNER LOIN $560 flatFeel so good about “covering” $299

Every stock I rip 24/7/365 has gone down 70% in the past 6-7 months except NVDA but she’s down $100 so far
Decided to sell breaking above even today at 581. May buy it again at a lower price.

$598 will be the forever high just wait until after earnings like AMZN huge upside surprise traded up $110 fell $300
"Lot of mutual funds have Nvidia as a top holding such as FSELX from Fidelity.

Nvidia may cross $575 before lunch and $580 before closing. Buy it before you miss this last chance at this price.
Keep driving it down. I need to add shares.
How those $800 PT’s feeling ? 
NVDA pig  hits $589 today or I never post again. Good options support @ $580. What an absolute dog down almost $100 in April
NVDA $589 July 2020NVDA $605 in almost  May 2021LOL Was $615 in early February

NVDA is going to fill her gap $457Just wait until after earnings LOL R.I.P. all longsYou will all be gone
Last time NVDA started going down like this it fell $160 in a couple of weeks so that takes us around $485 or so by May
Know when you know NVDA is going A LOT lower? When people begin muting me because I am short from $648+
Up by $32 between tomorrow and Friday of this week. Today end of the up up by $20.88Next week up by $72 for the entire week. From now till the end of next week therefore up by another $121 added to the price as of now
"Gee, did I say mid 500’s days ago? Hmmmmm think I did"
I'm just stockpiling cash. Every time I buy NVDA it drops like an anchor. Every time I look and see positive news the Company does the exact opposite of what it should be doing. Meanwhile ridiculously speculative stocks like Bitcoin and Tesla would have made me a millionaire about 10 times over. This market is totally backwards. Someone needs to get NVDA on the reddit boards. I want to retire early.

"NVDA is on the verge of massive market-moving growth. Due to the current price being less than Tesla, Amazon, or Google buy now because it may soon become equivalent to Tesla in the near term and then Google over a not so long period of time. NVDA can also be correlated to the price of Bitcoin in some way shape or form."
Moving more money into my Fidelity Brokerage account. Plan on having 200 shares of NVDA in my 401k account. If I was younger I would have 25% in my 401k. At 50 years old I'm happy with 10% in my 401k. Whatever age you are you NEED to be putting NVDA in your 401k!!!
Buying more at the open
"NVDA will be down $15-$20 at the open again tomorrow like today EXCEPT will fall under $500 by the close, down $72"

"Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $715 from $625 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes Nvidia's GTC announcements positively highlight the company's platform depth and expanding portfolio addressing a broadening range of end markets - from a deepening datacenter strategy to 5G edge compute/base stations via Aerial + EGX, autonomous vehicle, and much more. While NVIDIA is ""certainly not cheap,"" the announcements reinforce his view that the company is positioned as the best secular growth story in the semis."

Just invested more into Nvidia and additionally other techs too. Time to buy. Over 44 years of investing experience and lot of grey hair comes with experience though
Very bullish on NVDA. Hope they are allowed to buy ARM. Found part of the interview between both CEO's here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOfEkoOf5M
Heading to $600 without a doubt. Glad I loaded up at $500.

Called a few friends they are all buying more

"$700 target price reiterated by Merrill analyst:Q1 beat, expect sequential growth throughout 2021We reit. Buy ahead of FQ1 (AprQ) earnings on May 26 after market close. At analyst daylast month, NVDA positively pre’d Q1 above guide of $5.3bn. We now expect Q1 sales of $5.45bn ($50mn/1% above cons.) incl. $150mn of CMP (crypto SKU) vs. $50mn guide and modest upside to gaming, pro viz, data center. Importantly, while supply still tight, NVDA said they have sufficient supply for QoQ growth post Q1. For JulQ we see 1% QoQ growth driven by seasonal mid-single digit data center growth, though sub-seasonal -5% gaming (seasonal +20%) after strong Q1E (+14% QoQ vs. seasonal -25%). We expect stronger growth in OctQ (+5% QoQ) on return to seasonal (Oct seasonally strongest qtr) with improvements in supply (6+ mos after TSMC capex ramp). Thus, we raise CY21/22E sales by 3%/1% and EPS by 5%/2% to $13.40/$15.57 and keep our PO at $700, on 44x vs. 45x prior given contraction in sector multiples, still inline with EPS growth."
Someone correct me if I am wrong. I always see people on this board calling NVDA a chipmaker. But it is my understanding that NVDA does not make any chips. They buy the chips to produce their graphics cards
$nio is being a real competitor now if you looking to the new features.#The new battery range #The new model with the new features.#7x better then Tesla’s computer#Better cameras + lidar(Camera’s tesla 3mp while nio is going for 8mp)#partnership with $NVDA#Cheaper priced sedan then Tesla #new battery swap stations are x3 effecient#500+ more swapping stations in 2021Did i forget something ?
Nvidia reported quarterly earnings of $3.10 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $2.81 by 10.32 percent. This is a 64.02 percent increase over earnings of $1.89 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $5.00 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $4.82 billion by 3.80 percent. This is a 61.13 percent increase over sales of $3.10 billion the same period last year
I predict NVDA will be unchanged on Monday but.......a 10% market correction is inevitable. I am 100% in cash as of tonight in my trading account.
"willtori1 you haven't answer my question, the new leader undervalued AMD is worth $300?"
going up there with the Mars rover.
The weekly 540 put options are up 95% today! NVDA still $615????
After Hours games makes you sick. Buy @ 460 and incremental down every 50$ to 300. Rinse and repeat. 1000 dollar is years away. Buy at lower and take the opportunity to go to 600 later.
WHAT is going on? Now up 30..... what news is creating this? Or is a hedge fund running things up just to cash out.
"Hey  longs, maybe if the NASDAQ goes to 100,000 you can break even $589 buy"
Simmer down shorts this will open green...short more if you think it red on Thursday
if this was such a terrible ER why is AMD and INTC only down pennies? Not like AMD had better ER then NVDA...no doubt this moves back over $600 this week...big boys shaking the trees to get the weak hands shares
Just keep buying the dip with your fake Monopoly money 
Every other stock is up in pre-market except meme stocks. 600calls: Worthless. How long out does YOUR calendar go?
"I sold my last NVDA at $555 almost 2 weeks ago and it shot up to $615. I never felt bad about the trade. I have a buy order at $480, hope it fills tomorrow."
"Oh Kevin Sir, where are your famous what time Red queries?Must have found your answer in all Your Red Shorts!!! "
"@LarryTheLegend you have predicted NVDA being down $50 nearly everyday it has gone down. at the rate you keep saying it, NVDA should be $300 right now. just stop"
$504!!! Yessssss yessssss finally yesssss how many times did I tell you
To the MOON!!!
"I have a friend who runs a lot of money for MS he got clients into NVDA middle of last year, almost all of those clients fired him because of it"
Nvidia is where shorts go to die. Green.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
Any institution buys TSLA will accumulate NVDA... why worry...Lol
"Good thing everyone will stop gaming, using computers, cell phones and the internet, while also losing all interest in self driving electric vehicles and crypto post pandemic."
Also for those of you who are not able to understand german language - this video declares a lot of #Nvda success and future expectations. Watch it from minute 13:00. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3Ja9T5O4Wg
Do you think the price now is good for long term entry ?
"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a dominant player in the gaming GPU market, and its competitive position is only going to get better, according to an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.The Nvidia Analyst: Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy rating and $650 price target for Nvidia.The Nvidia Thesis: Mosesmann is positive on the opportunities that lie ahead for Nvidia, including a recurring revenue stream from Auto, data center inferencing and gaming, following the company's ""Virtual Fireside Chat"" with Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress. Automotive is likely to be the strongest catalyst, and the company could announce more partnerships with Automotive OEMs over the course of the year, the analyst said.n the strategically important data center compute part of the business, Nvidia is likely to continue to gain share, as this market turns away from CPUs and toward GPUs.""With the recent release of the low-end GeForce RTX GPU, Nvidia has a hand in all parts of the gaming market, and we believe will continue to see strong demand,"" the analyst wrote in the note.Nividia is the best managed and strategically positioned semiconductor company, said the analyst, with secular growth prospects driven by AI, gaming, and Automotive in the long run.HOLD that information all those who want to short NVDA"
Just how bad did NVDA Miss earnings by to fall $110
NVDA = FSLY down 40% in a week
$517 to $511 in less than a minute. This stock is less stable than GME
"As predicted by me it ended higher today and it will go to $1,000 so stay strong and stay invested"
NASDAQ IS BLOWING UP. INVEST/TRADE ACCORDINGLY.I AM A BUYER AT THESE LEVELS AND BELOW AS MUCH AS I CAN ACCUMULATE.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
Everything turning green. Warned TSLA Nvda Aapl
Anyone forget to sell $582 quadruple top formation when I begged them
"Time to add NVDA and Nio (before NIO starts moving to $100) and watch both grow. Autonomous driving requires advanced chippers. NIO developing the high end tech to push TSLA and NVDA developing the AI for autonomous EVs. Amazing that real AI is one year a way.NIO doing ""Autonomous Driving as a Service"". Another monthly revenue stream that can make getting high car cheaper. In a few years, I imagine Nio owners will be able to recover that cost by deploying their car as a Robitaxi while the owner works at their desk. Then the car can return to pick up the owner at the end of workday. NIO and NVDA are making the future tech that others will have to chase. Eventually, Uber and Lyft might be done while Nio and Tesla replace them and a portion of other public transportation in a few short years... yielding more revenue for NVDA and Nio."
Where is Needhams Rajvinder Gill. Has he been fired or something. We need him to come on CNBC and raise his price target from $800 to $900.
Arm deal not looking good so far. Will price drop if ARM deal definitely doesn't go through? Just asking.
senator passed stimulus..but Nasdaq doesn't look good....ndva continues moving downwardly.
When I read 100  consecutive posts in here how NVDA is going to $1000 I knew the end was near
Long but don't expect much from the ER....too much negativity about big tech. Anyone got the whisper numbers?
"you know it....huang came out on Cramer and said "" a buying opportunity""....of course that was $70 north of here. I watched Cramer do that with the ""race to twelve"" with DYN years ago. Popped and went bankrupt. He hides in some good calls while he scams the world with his banking buddies. Is he'll to hot for folks like that?"
Almost back to Fridays lows $467 should hit $299 by next week
"NVDA $615 to $545 in two weeks!NVDA was $545 two earnings reports ago and they blew out both earnings! “If a stock doesn’t go up on great news, it’s going down.”"
Well it all went better until Powell went on air. Patience is a virtue.
I honestly don’t understand how NVDA is still this high $477???
How’s choochoo train Boy doin today? Has he left the station? 
NVDA will be under $500 tomorrow Anyone want to bet???
Benzinga poll: only 22% thinks nvidia will grow faster than intel/amd. Seriously? Nvidia is positioned in more fields and these are booming. AMD/INTc's bread and butter remains x86 territory and we all know how that is evolving (apple eg).
NVIDIA reached an all time high at 602.37
Will close down $50 today. Stocks never do well down $80 into earnings ever! Ask FSLY shareholders. I abused that stock at $122 now $69 in a week!
NVDA just announced new non gaming chip specific for crypto mining
Looks like back to 600+ today
to the 
Going to 550 tomorrow and 600 on coming Monday. It's an expensive stock. Will never go under 500 in our livetime
OK  let’s ask for Monday: WHAT TIME RED ? 9:30  am EST
Talking about a coiled spring!
CRAMER JUST SAID NVDA COULD DOUBLE IF ARM IS ACQUIRED
Now she’s firmly under her 200 day MA so feel free to ride to 299. Anyone not short $487 is beyond insane
"The 13,000 call options bought today @ $600 are all R.I.P. trust me"
great buying opp. on the dip
"Do you longs feel violated yet? If not, you will soon enough. ""Value"" is in favor now. Value stocks are stocks with no earnings, high debt that grow at 3% per year. Why do you want to own growth now? Don't fight the tape. Sell semiconductors because as you know semiconductors are no longer needed and there is a huge glut of chips so many in fact they are filling football stadiums with unsold chips. Get out and save whatever dignity and money you have remaining!!!!!"
Remember when Kevin told you to short 467 
What drops quicker?(1) Prom dresses after prom night(2) NVDA stock daily
"I am not gonna lie, bought @ 578 now I am apparently stuck for a couple of years here."
The bottom line is huang doesn’t have a clue
$519+ still not near a PC $463 this week 100%
Nothing goes straight down 615 to 460 is a start next leg is 299
Hey all...just out of curiosity why buy this stock? Or even short it? Why put money in this when ur can buy cheaper stocks that soar 50 to 100 percent?? I just dont get it? 11million shares traded on this security ...alit of money
"all i know is, i had a chance to turn 5k into 10ml on two trades in 4 days i got one leg but missed the whopper down leg with nvda repeatedly getting capped at 555x area nvda 500p shot up 8,000% in 3 days as nvda divebombed from 555x to sub 470but i did pull the trigger on calls at the sub 470 washout lows and paid off big time 500c shot up 2,500% in 3.5hrs"
"If NVDA is going to $700, $1000....you better load up at $595. Who is buying today and who is praying today ?"
An immediate V back to $600...
"While many of the industry's partnerships are not publicly known, Navigant Research claims that ""virtually every company” involved in self-driving technology utilizes NVIDIA in some way. This includes Toyota, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, VW, ZF, Continental, Kenworth, and Peterbilt… NVIDIA claims over 370 partners with some involvement."
"Free-DUMB 615 to 495 = 120 x 6500 shares = WOW  $800,000 loss in just NVDA in a week"
"NVDA could be over $700 after its E/R next week as BITCOIN hit all time new record high today $52,000....Like TESLA bought 1.5 billion in bitcoins....which give NVDA a high boost ahead nvda 's e/r....TSLA 'S BEEN OVER $4500 / SHARE and so NVDA COULD BE at least soon $1500 this year.....BUY MORE....ON DIP TODAY AS A GREAT BARGAIN...GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITIES TODAY...."
Total market manipulation using the 10 year yield as an excuse! Powell said rates staying here! Oh well
Nvidia chip is a HUGE dinosaur. Intel Xe is a new sleek design with chiplets. The future in graphics is Intel.
"Kevin Sir, what time is Vipul serving us drinks? "
"Shares are rising, they must be talking about this at reddit."
NVDA $615 to $540 in a week and earnings have passed (-$50 earnings day) R.I.P.  DOA 
Congratulations  to all longs. Sell half here $588 and let the rest “ride”.
"HUANG ceo just sold 24,000,000 550"
"@benjo where are you? hiding cause your $580 prediction for today failed? haha hiding just like Darth, no wonder people don't listen to you"
bought few more shares at 488 ....Still company wich growing fast and great balance sheets!!!
Go long at these levels for sure.
"February 1st NVDA closed at $527. Earnings were really good, guidance wasn’t bad considering chip shortages will continue another quarter or two and the Entire market is down BIG today. Nothing has changed. Congrats to the shorts that finally caught a temporary break. NVDA will continue to lead the future in technology."
"I don't know why everyone thinks stocks always go up.Infact look at amazon.... is it a bad company? No its not.... stocks don't always go up. It's healthy for the stock to consolidate and make a new low. Everything great is worth waiting for. Nothing easy in life lasts a long time. Sleep great , have a great life NVDA Longs you are invested in the best future growth company."
"So here we are again, another Friday, another day those 600 calls are expiring worthless. I shorted these calls for as far as the calendar goes. The Mayans calendar ran out, and so will the Gregorian and Julian calendars, before my shorts on the 600 calls. Some of those calls are decaying from $96 per contract. They down to 6. I’m not to worried or do you think nvda will have a 25% day today (can someone explain that to the options book kid? His memer thing breaks right about “in the money”)"
Did the CEO die during the conference call??
"AHs today, Apple close to contract with Hyundai Kia for Apple car in 24/25. Nvidia and Hyundai already in agreement for AI in Hyundai cars. If Nvidia gets into Apple car, more long term upside as Auto continues to build for Nvidia."
Last March NVDA fell 60%That takes it to $250 I will cover and go long there With tight stops
NVIDIA is up 5.48% to 489.15
dont worry it will end higher today. Thanko
Hahahahahaha! ....Kyle9 days agoNVIDIA CorporationOut. Be back at 515
"Great day for NVDA! Up until 2021 I had 100% of my 'cash' in NVDA (500 shares), but everyone kept telling me to diversify, so I sold 10% of my NVDA shares at $555 and bought some NIO and GEVO (both breaking even after a month and bought some BNGO today. For some reason I feel like I'm cheating on my girlfriend (NVDA) which continues to run up. What am I to do?? I probably should have just put that 10% in Apple or Microsoft or a long term stable company....I've lost thousands and thousands in speculative stocks over the years. Maybe I'll just sell the 10% and buy back NVDA...."
QQQs just lost $300.
NVDA Price Target $700
"this stock ALWAYS goes down the next day. if you people haven't figured that out yet I don't know what to tell ya. BUY more.. 1,000 by end of the year."

Has the bankruptcy been announced yet or what?
GME up 150%$40 to $150How’s NVDA doing? Will be $504!!!
Why would anyone be long stonks here? Just short every $5 and retire rich  when it crashes $200 in a week again soon 
"BNY Mellon, USA's oldest bank, warms upto Bitcoin - it blasts past $48k today.

$504 was obvious. Now $488 in about an hour

BUY THE MARKET DIPS! GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!
575 to 570 in literally one second. Not a stable stock. Nice cheap run  will be 460 in two weeks
10 year under 1.50 next week and NVDA over $525. As simple as that.
"Slashing GDP growth by the day is peak “woke”, I wonder which children’s author gets sent to the gulag next?"

What's up with this stock? Doing sideways lately!! Do something Jen!! Jen is very genius CEO!!
Now if ARM deal goes through....
have people learned not to sell this stock? 800 by july. bet me.
Looking at $480 after earnings tonight. Oh No !
Cheap shares ahead.... won't last.
Kevin gets is arxx handed over on Monday bottom is in. I hope it drops further but changes are minor.
My INTC up again NVDA was twice INTC market capNow even
AMD INTC QCOM all chip companies are R.I.P. they can’t produce them fast enough demand is too high BUT what you can’t produce you can’t sell which is just as bad a no demand. That’s why AMD and NVDA haven’t moved a penny in almost 7 months. Supply constrained you will hear it 1000x when NVDA falls 12% like QCOM
me waiting on earnings
Wish had more cash !!This gem is definitely undervalued
"I told you all 1000x it’s February/March like last year, NVDA could easily fall 50% in a week"
Picture this You are in the lobby of an exclusive hotel and a young porter come through with an announcement for Kevin.DIAPERS FOR KEVIN DIAPERS FOR KEVIN MR KEVIN YOUR DIAPERS ARE HERE
"Weeeeeee! Just remember, the only people that get hurt on roller coasters are the ones who jump off at the bottom. Sit back and enjoy the steady ride back up to the top "
I think Kevin will have to return his Bugatti
analysts were expecting next quarter guidance to be 4.5 Billion but NVDA guidance was 5.3 Billionwhich means they will do 5.5 Billion
Don't forget NVDA bagdolders conference is scheduled for tomorrow. Pls bring u r won coffee n chair. Thanks again !!I wish u good luck.
"2/26 nvda 550p have cratered all day long-77% todayyet larry the liar claims he's up 300%even on this last hour sell off, 550p have barely doubled from 1.80 lows to 3.30 last trade"
AVGO will help the entire chip sector tomorrow. What a steal at $445.

BUY NVIDIA NOW!BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS THE STOCK WILL BE $750+
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Will hit $504 by tomorrow

Most absurd forever high? AMZN $1600 NFLX $600 NVDA $615 $TSLA $902 $PYPL $309 CRWD $250???? I say NVDA $615 easily
"a week before earnings with nvda at 615 i was speculating if nvda would tag 650 on earnings beat and raiseand then, nvda got the whack a mole treatment no worriesnvda is a must own"
Awesome 5 year chart. So much of what we do requires their chips. They are way ahead of other chip makers with no chance of slowing down.
Lower price for a freedom to average in! 
Nvidia's chip is a HUGE monolith dinosaur. The future is Intel's Xe at 42 TFLOPS and a sleek brand new chiplet design.
Big players still shaking weak hands by keeping price low. my opinion.
NASDAQ could fall 1000 tomorrow morning at this rate would be down 20% this week

Shorting more 536 A gift  Will gap down $50 tomorrow again AMD introducing their new gamer card

This Kevin guy has never seen green his entire life
I actually finally feel really sorry for the longs in here. They have to honestly be on the verge of jumping
Gee what’s that? Oh just ANOTHER opening selloff -$6!!! Lock up huang
No longer does great earning mean anything......day traders would rather pay their 35% in taxes
"I love when shorts troll a great company to drive the price down. I accumulate more and more shares at a discount. Dominating chips in the most explosive market segments: Gaming, AI, 5G, Data Centers, Crypto. One day, BA-BOOM!!!!! 900+!!!!!"
Super Deal day at the NVDA Grocery Market!! =)
Let’s get this down $50 before earnings. Come on now let’s band together. How are those once again bloated 600 call options looking
"Mention bidon in a post, 100% guarantee of beeing delete. So much for free speech!!!?!"
That’s it 25th short in NVDA (have not covered one share) $541 here! What a gift 
Poor shorts. GOOG should take us higher tomorrow.
Imagine shorts if NVDA goes up over 16% after releasing better than expected ER like ITRI did this morning
I would love 2 see a stock split like apple !!!!! I do see good chance this year $$$$$$$$$
When NASDAQ fell 300 NVDA fell $40 now NASDAQ is up 300 and NVDA is up $16. 
Bullish on NVDA. But I think this may pull back to $454 short term.
Hope Kalpesh shows up to cheerlead!!!!
NVDA will be down $50 again one day this week guaranteed
Actually today is NVDA best day in a month only down $15
What in hell has caused the run-up to 571? ARE WE ON REDDIT?!!
I hope it's a $40 to $50 move to the upside to cover the unnecessary decline after the earnings report and $10 or so more above that. It is possible because NVDA has a red hot future.
Fantastic week to be a Nvidia long. Woo-Hoo..!!!

NVDA only stock I ever saw  that drops  $50 a day regularly BUT only goes up maybe  $5 on a huge market up day!
If 515 holds then Nvidia will be fine. Otherwise we are headed lower...
"Nvidia hardly lasts more than a day of increase. No offense to any longs, but it's a fact. The only way to play this is to sell when high and buy back when low. Unlike KevinTheLoser who only shorts and loses every short."

Alibaba has an electric vehicle NVDA supply’s the chips￼
This is going up. Just a matter of time. Excellent quarter. Great products. World class management. Ignore today’s market action. Will be higher by next week.
This stock is going to $1000. Even the Federal Government want to buy more chips as per the article I read a few days back . A car needs two big things to run an engine and a transmission. An artificial intelligence etc needs chips or semiconductors to run. Everything else is build around this to come up with a great product. These products almost always 100% makes our lives better in millions of different ways. I can list at least 500 of them. I am very confident about the growth of the entire semiconductor sector and NVIDIA will play a great part in this great expansion

"My “firm” does a lot of research and a lot of “digging” when we began shorting NVDA last year over $580, we saw an opportunity and took it. Intel will eventually blow NVDA out of the water again like usual. NVDA will be under $300 and INTC will be $100+"
BUY BEFORE $600
"Bye  bye  $550, it’s been nice  knowing you. Does anyone in here have any clue on how to read an options chart?"
NVDA was recently twice the market cap of INTC. They will be even in a month. Anyone see INTC MU WDC three chip makers at 52 week highs
Tomorrow another $40 down
was it something related to the forecast with gaming being the big chunk of the first quarter?
I HOPE SOME OF YOU BOUGHT SHARES YESTERDAY LIKE I ADVISED DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN. ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO REGULARLY ADD SHARES ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN AND TO ADD MORE DURING MARKET DROPS. ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!

You have to be beyond insane to hold NVDA into earnings! Has any stock gone higher after earnings other than NFLX? Just buy the 600 weekly puts for the next 10 weeks
David Tepper says 10 year has topped out and ranged bound 1.3-1.6. Very bullish on stocks
Tomorrow $488. GUARANTEED! $504 gap will be filled! Anyone listen @ $615 ?? Just curious

Afterall its a 6% quarterly revenue growth only...? Also another 6% expected for next quarter. Would it be too greedy to expect double digit growth for an overvakued stock?
NVDA is broken. Pls be safe before 336. It's going to break 472 again. No reason to invest in this. NVDA leads the semis down. Watch it out. $336.
Bought this winner and sold with nice profit. Then bought a full position AGAIN when fell to $175 a share.Haven't sold a share since $175....
"That’s it, shorting $495 here cover $299. Save this post"

i was hoping for little pullback for healthy sustained rise over long period of time.
Seems there is a little softness in the stock today. Is Nvidia still a viable company? Maybe dividend cut and reverse split are next?

Decent support @ $550. Was $589 over 7 months ago. HORRIBLE manipulated stock BUT great company.
NVDA earning is around the corner and it is very good. NVDA has taken up business with Amazon and partnered with NIO. NVDA has also taken most business with China's electric cars. NVDA stock will sky rocket to over 590$. Its a must buy.

NIO partners with Nvidia on next-gen vehicle tech. NIO says it will use Nvidia's Drive Orin system-on-a-chip for it's new generation for it's electric and autonomous vehicles. This on top of ARM acquisition sets up Nvidia quite nicely for the future. As I said weeks ago this stock will reach a 1000.00 and definitely a favorite in the chip industry going forward in 2021.

"Nvidia will be at $1,000 in 1 to 2 years if it doesn't split! take it to the bank!"
"I started thinking how does Nvidia come out with new products so fast that give like 50X jump in performance. I have been in sales and marketing for 25 years and have never seen a company like this. How do they do that???Here is how, if u spent $25 billion in AI development (software writing software) over 10 years and u are the leader in building super computers. this leads to a new product machine. That is the reason why I think Nvidia is the smartest company in the world . Some people think of Nvidia as a semiconductor company but this really is a new product machine with the fastest and smartest supporting cast around."
Would you rather own a SPAC or NVDA? I would say the latter. Money will gravitate towards quality and not towards pure speculation.
"NVDA and autonomous driving is going to be huge....From this article: ""NVIDIA's latest Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs) -- provides the computing horsepower needed to rapidly process data from lidar, radar, and cameras and run the deep neural networks that allow the car to move autonomously.""When it comes to AI, NVIDIA's best-in-class GPUs significantly outperform Intel's chips. And NVIDIA's industry-leading solution has helped the company attract dozens of partners, from start-ups to established enterprises. These include automakers Toyota, Audi, Volvo, and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz; mobility service providers like Airbus, Aurora Mobile, and Zoox."""

"As per yahoo sponsored news everyday NVDA is in a buy zone for last 6 months, but then next day price falls mostly. They never mention when to sell or when it is in sell zone. To buy at the peak and hold for long , it seems risky for me. I will see when stock price come down near $450"
No one in the world  is holding NVDA over the weekend
"A little discouraging; most every stock i follow has easily recovered the past weeks drops. Will take some patience with NVDA; but fully expect to recover before what many ""experts"" predict a huge market wide down by June. A little concerned it (market crash/correction) happens in ""Sell in May and go away ""."
My favorite  thing to do is post something of brilliance than “like” my own post
"I hope Shorty covered, or Longs may have to think of a Go Fund Me for the likes of Kevin!"
NVDA keeps the streak alive of companies collapsing after great earnings now 1000 in a row
Every stock ARK Kathie Woods buys is down 30-40% in 2021. Market wanted to teach that 60 year old novice a lesson. She’s probably a Democrat
expensive above 500
NVDA down $50 into the weekend. 463 gap to be filled today. Anyone want to bet????
"It's all good news with NVDA e/r today.... no doubt it could UP HUGE by tomorrow....Chip giant NVIDIA (NVDA Quick QuoteNVDA - Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines after regular trading this afternoon, with earnings of $3.10 per share surpassing the $2.80 anticipated in what is yet another record quarter for the company. Revenues of $5.00 billion improved 61% year over year, outpacing the $4.83 billion analysts were looking for. Guidance for Q1 2021 on the top line improved to $5.3 billion from the $4.5 billion in the Zacks consensus.Its Gaming business brought in $2.5 billion in the quarter, Data Center $1.9 billion — neither of which was unexpected, but brought very solid performance in Q4. The company lauded Gaming now being the world’s most popular form of entertainment, in which NVIDIA plays an integral part."
The NASDAQ would have to rise a billion points for NVDA  to get back to $615 or 3 weeks ago
Price prediction for tomorrow
"So you think that a company with the nickname ""Ngreedia"" will not milk each a every penny out of this massive chip shortage? Huh? Huh..!?? Average Selling Prices are going to skyrocket. Nvidia will be making money buy the truck.. eh!? ..boatloads!!Nvidia is king! All hail the king."
longs today
NVDA bag holder's conference be held soon...Pls bring your own coffee and chair.
"Omg lol  omg  lol @ $491.99 I guaranteed NVDA would trade $299 before $482, dropped $10 without an uptick. Dow will be 50,000 and NVDA will be $299. Have to be brain dead not to see this shift back to real world  companies!!!"
shorts thinking they are right is funny to watch. NVDA still up $50 for the week
"This stock is so manipulated, $610 to $600...Huang should be locked up....just kidding....oh no !"
Time for buy and hold tight for long run good valu you get back very soon
What in the world are we down when we did better than better?

"NVidia has only one use for their GPUs, mining. Pc gameing is dead. People play on console. Inform yourself"
I'm getting drunk on a plane.
Anyone like $615 or $475? Anyone remember $502 this morning
Anyone in here ever listen to the greatest mathematical equation since e=mc2? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
rotation into cyclicals and industrials and financials continueseasily beating all other sectors
Stock with good earnings fall but within week stocks break there all time high..Twitter is a example so just hold
Gap at $504 to be filled. Also $532. Please be careful out there and trade accordingly.
Any STONK Cathie Woods owns is R.I.P. All of her funds will be R.I.P. this year
Bitcoin hits $50k.... wow
A welcomed and needed blowoff from the top leading to more massive gains heading into a Stellar ER and beyond. On to $700

"One chipmaker stock could have a nearly 70% rally amid the semis shortage, trader says. That is right, people. Nvidia! Gordon said Nvidia, in particular, shows a promising trend. “I love the technical setup, looks like if we can get above $600, we actually don’t have … resistance until about $1,000,” said Gordon, who holds shares in the company.Hah! Hah!!"
I’ve been waiting for a good entry point. Today is the day!￼
Downturn is not going to last. NVDA is down with the whole chip sector today. Shorts will not get a better chance to cover again. Severe chip shortage will push NVDA back up to original pricing of $580 by end of March. Good luck to you all.
$615 to $504 today!!! Ladies Germs  here comes 504
Cramer is ready to pump NVDA on CNBS shortly. kiss of death.
"unbelievable, shame on Dow Jones for nearly ruining a good day. thankfully it went sicko mode in the last few minutes"
THERE GOES THE NASDAQ. LOWERING TIDE DROPS ALL SHIPS!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.
Oh yeah...this is just effin great! Keep dropping the quarters on this ride. Reality wins in the end...
This is a $300 stock tops
"everyone needs to calm down. stocks have price movements and there has been profit taking today due to them going up so much from the nio day news. in the long term, this company is going to do amazing. if you need to calm your nerves, watch the ces 2021 event nvidia had today, it’ll show you nvidias importance in the industry they dominate in"
CHOO CHOO! ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
Can not get on TDA Again and now putting restrictions onto what I can buy? Any other platforms doing the same?
Beat & Drop are norm these days. i expect a 5-10% drop tomorrow...
today's movement confirmed 530-540 was the new support..we might see a slow and steady upward movement all the way to 700 as last year..
"The ""Key Statistics"" section in Yahoo shows earnings on the 24th; I think it's in error and is actually the 11th."
NVDA (TURD ) will never ever ever trade $500 again after tomorrow. Great article on Seeking Alpha today about how this should trade $300 soon!
The buy power is strong on this one. ...
Kathie Wood  ARKK ETF 160 to 110 down 33%
Took the week off haven’t followed NVDA is it still $614?????
Just keep shorting here $483 you can’t lose ever
My newest short very large position from 525 will make me $1m by Friday
I knew it was too good to last....
should care-facility chronics be relocated to fema camps in remote deserts?with no internet
It's not reversal at all. The rise of DOW means something away from tech. I see NVDA drifting lower n PE be like QCOM. I won't buy. It's going to be sold off.
I LOVE NVIDIA!
Hah! Hah!!
"Dumb algorithm trades - yield higher, sell... yield lower, buy... LOL"
"I wanted to sell at $615, and I didn’t pull the trigger. So regret it."
NVDA’s favorite phrase is.....”New lows for the day”
NVDA up this month from $516. We are glad to take those dollars and let the shorts take a couple of nickles.
I bet NVDA trades $0 before $500. Any takers?????
I think NVDA misses earnings and warns soon
im starting to think under $500 is no longer cheap and possibly a risk
NVDA down 20% in a week today on 14m shares 2x normal which means it’s going MUCH lower probably down 50% like last March
"Its all about ""Streaming videos"" in the Server market. Intel's Xe-SG1 is the BEST card for video streaming."
"I know nvda ""very well"" and I say it's time for some retracement."
"We will have Needhams Rajvinder Gill raise his price target AH or tomorrow. Dude hasn't been on CNBC for a while. Hans NosesMan is getting all the limelight, with his frequent upgrades.Stock should ZOOM up. Get ready for lift off."
It's always good to profit take and not to be greedy. No one says you have to hold it. Buy low sell high. But don't follow like KevinTheLoser who only shorts and never longs.
"Something to read and digest....""The company is set to release the January quarter results today after the bell, and Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann expects Nvidia to post a “beat and raise.”“We see the January quarter being driven by strength in Gaming, Professional Visualization, and a continued recovery in Automotive offset by a sequential decline in Data Center,” the 5-star analyst said. “While the outlook will likely see continued adoption of Ampere and the recently announced Ampere featured laptops, strength in AI and cloud computing verticals, better than expected Gaming, and Automotive growth.”Mosesmann expects sales in the longer 14-week quarter to be above his and the Street’s forecast for low single-digit sequential growth, with EPS also coming in higher than his $2.80 forecast and the consensus estimate of $2.81.Nvidia’s main breadwinner, Gaming, should rise mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter, driven by “continued ramp of the RTX 30 series, products, work-from-home demand dynamics, and game console SoCs.”Of the company’s fast-growing division, Data Center, the analyst anticipates a cooling off period with a pause to its rally and a sequential low single-digits decline. The outlook for the segment is a key area to watch on the earnings call, where Mosesmann will be keen to learn about the likely duration of supply chain shortages, which the analyst believes will continue beyond F2Q21, and “controls on cryptocurrency mining using GPUs.”Additionally, over the next several quarters, the data processing unit will continue to be a focal point and is noted as another tailwind. All in all, Mosesmann makes no bones about his long-term prospects for the GPU heavyweight.“We see NVDA as the best managed and strategically positioned semiconductor company,” the analyst summed up."""
Looks like it will be under $430 tomorrow and under $400 Wednesday
May I know what happened to NVIDIA?
I see the perma bulls are once again out in full force! Short $515 and never work again by 2022!
"wowLooks like this is worse than NVDA fall of 2018 November.Nice opportunity to add more if you have cash, else simply stay put and be patient."
KEEP YOUR POWDER DRY KIDS!YOU'LL NEVER PICK THE BOTTOM. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.WATCH AND LEARN. ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO
Where are the yahoo sponsored analysts who have strong recommendations to by NVDA and AMD?
NAS just suxchs right now. Tech not even remotely in favor. Time to add and check back in summer
nvda is notorious for making new all time highs then instantly getting the whack a mole treatment
Sell off #5
I think  people are finally beginning to realize that the stock market is no joke it’s not some game to be taken lightly and stocks fall 10x faster than they rise
"Comes right down to Shorty being greedy, should have Covered Monday! But Nooooooooo"
"Will never ever forget the buyer $593 who I begged to sell $592, they didn’t, right to $460 in 3 days lol"
Anyone buy $615 last week? How about $602 last night? ROTFLMFAO
The weekly 600 calls still $25? Not near a PC options chart. Thank you in advance. Asking for a friend. I made more in two days than all the longs combined since August!
"Great products, waiting for my rtx 3080. But the point is waiting, not so much only b/c of demand but there is a slow down in the entire chain, meaning they can’t possibly be making the revenue that they should and it will never be made up."
NVDA is a sure winner.Trust NVDA and you will be rewarded.
Gotta love those $800 upgrades huh? Still think these analysts arent corrupt?
I guess I shouldn't have waited for the 504 gap fill.
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE! LIFE IS GOOD MY FRIENDS! LIFE IS GOOD!CONGRATULATIONS ALL NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS! YOU BOUGHT INTO A GREAT COMPANY AND GREAT STOCK! ENJOY THE RIDE! REMEMBER....DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON A REGULAR BASIS WEEKLY/MONTHLY!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
The chips shortage is real. NVDA can basically name it’s price and have 10 Takers. This isn’t ending overnight. NVDA has a backlog of orders well into the mystic.These type of stock spurts like we saw today will be common place. GET YUR CHiPS HEYA. hehe 
I predict that in March NVDA is testing her 200 day MA at $450/$460. SAVE THIS BRILLIANCE! I would prefer AIDS to owning NVDA
Knew it would tank post earnings but this is a slaughter 
"Fed's Powell calms markets down - no rate increases - WSJWSJ - Tech stocks rebounded from an early-morning rout Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that a central-bank interest rate increase remains far off in the future, easing some concern over rising rates.The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, lower for a sixth consecutive session as investors recalibrate their expectations for stocks as bond yields climb. The broad stock market index earlier was down as much as 1.8%."
"anyone here who can't see AI, EV, cloud computing and dynamic video processing is the next 30 years and that NVDA is top in all of these...just keep waiting to buy and always miss the boat. I won't."
ARM will happen!! Hah! Hah!! One trillion dollars market cap. Soon.
several articles out stating US big tech against the ARM deal. Of course they are they want it lol
CONGRATULATIONS NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!! WE RECENTLY MADE NEW ALL TIME HIGHS! THE BEST IS YET TO COME!!! $700 AFTER EARNINGS!
$595 looks to be a nice  short. I am new to this forum BUT when I see everyone cheering  it never ends well
$NVDA $WIMI $FB The whole world is throwing money in and scared money don’t make money. Close your shorts and go long. This is a BULL market!
NVDA needs to split to attract new retail buyers.
"Two words, market manipulation. It’s so obvious it’s almost comical. NVDA crushes it with best quarter to date w/excellent forward looking guidance & then takes a 20%+ haircut, NOT SELLING a single share. Will be adding to my position very soon."
I think the reality of extraordinary supply crunch for the foreseeable future is weighing this thing down.
this feeling when you being robbed and you can't do anything lol correction they say ... hahahah basically just to load up more and next year they will start something different I whould not be surprised if they say inflation and tech stocks drop for another 20% just so they buy cheap companies with a sting balance sheets and great growth redicolous
Fantastic Day! Well done NVDA! 
Hey  longs $544 isn’t $615 BUT it’s better than $460
"Nvidia (NVDA)Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia today and set a price target of $650.00. The company’s shares closed last Wednesday at $579.96, close to its 52-week high of $614.90."
"@VIPUL keep dreaming. just cause it's down, doesn't mean it will go $25 down"
Dow up 600NVDA lows of the past 8 months Wow 
"This CEO HUANG I give him credit he is trying BUT he can’t compete with INTC & AMD long term. Also, he’s worth $12b and sells $100m a month in stock, so you really think he cares if NVDA is $500 or $600? It’s like the difference between $5 and $6 to most people, it’s meaningless"
Before feb 19 will be back easily fom 550 to 575....... earnings are coming with very good numbers....
Why is down ah . It doesn’t make any sense

"Vinfast said all three vehicles will meet the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 5-star safety rating, thanks in part to suite of electronic driver-assist features. The most advanced of these feature in the VF32 and VF33 and include adaptive cruise control, collision warning, and park assist. All three models can also be fitted with the hardware required for full self-driving, including lidar sensors, 15 cameras, Nvidia's Drive Orin computer, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Vinfast hasn't said when its vehicles will be ready for full self-driving, though....Vinfast's main plant is located in Hai Phong, Vietnam.

Any Truth to the rumor that Kevin The Lemon is delivering for Grub Hub to pay off his INSANE Short Bets on NVDA???
No one in the world is buying NVDA into a weekend
It's already down !!! What is going on. Come on pumpers buy more.
Screaming Buy !!

"Amazing, much better than expecting, impressive!"
Sell off is not going to stop. Buy puts on pump. Next week 540.
"I feel sorry for those who sold out. There is something wrong when people can not accept a reasonable risk for a reasonable return. What we have seen has turned some portions of the market into gambling, not investing. For the old timers, this may be acceptable, so I ask, is the market just for the strong and experienced like most on this board? I just can not see this as a healthy thing for anybody. Scaring away investors because some greedy turkeys want it all is not the answer."

No wonder no one here likes Kevin. Kevin loves the negative attention and that’s okay. Some people dig that sort of thing. I’m long NVDA and am looking to pick up a few more shares to add. Great day for bargain hunters who avoid these chat rooms. ￼
Is Larry the Legend also Kevin? Comical
"(nothing against amd, I picked some up, but I predicted this when the 3xxx series were announced and even before that) tweaktown: ""AMD Radeon GPU market share dies down, NVIDIA domination continuesAMD Radeon GPU market share drops 33% year-over-year, NVIDIA dominating, crypto mining and next-gen consoles are hurting it all."
Wow! GM beat expectations but is worried about the shortage of chips (please read their statement on yahoo) . What a great sector semiconductors is! Time to increase production by all companies and all kinds of chips. I feel so good about this sector hence I am buying more such as FSELX with Nvidia as a major holding. WOW
This is going to be a moon shot day! Shorts will be eviscerated!
this is easy a $600B company!
shorts win ; longs wounded :-) come on longs.....we can do it

Look at the daily chart...NVDA in 200dma area and bottom of the trading channel. was just 614. Good Luck
Gap @ 463 & 498 Both will definitely be filled 100%Trade accordingly Probably be down $100 one of these days when the ARM deal fails or someone outbids them

Is everyone having fun today?
NVDA is going to drop $50 today! Please anyone long sell and get short! There is bad news out there
After we have a blowout earnings report the upgrades will pour in. $700 is just around the corner!
Market oversold today due for a BIG REBOUNCE tomorrow....
I'm not selling
$573 rotflmfao  Did it really trade there or was that fake? Tell me please it was fake. This stock is SO HEAVY
Overall market conditions are going to stunt any positive movement of this thing for a while. I was not expecting down $60+ into stellar earnings but I'll admit that I wasn't sure there would be stellar earnings. Going to load up more once we find the bottom but I'm getting pretty annoyed at this thing constantly trading sideways while speculative stocks like TSLA have split and blown up multiple times.

Praying for terrible  employment numbers tomorrow so NVDA drops $100
"Blowout quarter coming, TSMC ,ASML...now intel PC chips sales were outstanding while AMD is giving them a hard time, AMD will beat too. But nvidia has more expansion in various fields (like EV). We're going to see upgrades before earnings for sure."
Could we see NVDA down $40+ for the 7th time since August ?
I am done trading today but can't resist putting a limit order to buy 200 at $515. Let's go.
Nvidia has gone back to its roots. Its just a gaming company.
Nvidia green again. You can't keep a good thing down.
"When will JenHsun Huang abandon his deal to acquire ARM?All U.S. big techs are against the acquisition QCOM, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT.UK , EU and China too.JenHsun has sold over $15 Bil of his Nvidia's shares, including over $10 Bil in his trust in the past 8 months"
NVDA $520 is the highest this stock will ever be again ever! Save this brilliance
Sell $520 here NVDA will never ever be in the 500’s ever again after today
Be nice if CEO would stop down playing things causing the stock price to drop after a quarter. Same thing happened with AMD.
I don't care whether you're long or short. This board is just great entertainment.
Still think huang cares about the little investor?
This stock should be up 50 points in one day but it won’t
Putting my money where my mouth is: Short $585.75 here! Thank you i dear Jesus lord
Up on above average volume NVDA is headed to $600...
$593.00 After Hours so there are some remotely clever shorts. Who knew? I guess not all of them want to cover at $600+ tomorrow. Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
"I heard Social Service's is initiating a wellness check on KrapperKeeper, Darth Dummy, Tanya, Kevin etc..."
My 435 puts I bought Friday at the close up 350% LOL  . Know why I bought them? VIPUL said it was going to $520. LOL!
Sorry for my absence this afternoon. I was too busy counting my money. I bet the shorts didn't have that problem (and were all over this board). Lol.
"BWAHAHAHA no worries, mario aka jagoff is buying 5000 more"
MLNX kept Nvidia data center growth up. Otherwise its just a gaming company.
"I sold at $580 right at the close, then felt like a fool when it hit $600, and now I feel like a genius again. The new stock market is not for those who get motion sickness easily."

Trust NVDA and you will be rewarded.Try to buy on every dip.
"Got a cover and buy $504! Should hit Wednesday night! Book it, Dano"

Sure glad the qtrly report kept NVDA from taking a header today.
Remember AAPL FSLY QCOM AMD INTC all fell 20% after incredible earnings
You think 477 is low just wait for 299 this month GUARANTEED! ARK like their buys @ $615 or no?

NVDA will be down $50 tomorrow. Save this post please
Here's to ALL THE SHORTS who'll be servicing Jensen's Huang for the foreseeable future!
That was a bullish close today. 1.2m shares on the last 15 minute bar made up for the awful open. I would hate to be short this stock right now. Could up gap nicely tomorrow.
The winner of WHAT TIME  RED today was 9:31am EST. Congratulations  to all that played today.
Benchmark raises raises NVDA target to 670
Under 100.00 soon.
Need to see $450 first
522 -> 531 today
So much for never ever seeing $500 again.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
Great company but this stock been dead money for the last 6 months.
NVDA + $500 = Superman + Kryptonite Equation redone from $564
"NVDA up almost $20 AND up AH! Now that is BULLISH! This stock is going to get to $1,000 faster then I thought!"
I can’t wait until it fills the $463 gap and not one person in here acknowledges I was right at $519+
up on high vol = good
"Good news is bad, bad news is even worse.Never fails after any earnings report, does it?"
"Could be my most dramatic comeback ever. Down almost 6 figures, I am getting close to even for the day.It's been a wild ride this week. Very wild but have seen a lot in my 60 years of investing."
Great day to be adding to your positions on some of these beaten down tech stocks. Microsoft holding up exceptionally well.
Back to 600
"NVDA, share price is three steps forward, two steps back?"
"Yep, not just Nasdaq futures that are down. Russel 2000, DJIA and S&P500 all pushing solid red tonight at 11:30 ET. More blood letting when markets open in the morning."
"If this past week didn’t prove to everyone that all stonks in America are bloated Ponzi schemes, I don’t know what it will take to convince you all"
"WHAT, is seriously holding this down today ?I don't understand￼ !"
Can we please go below $500 finally in March R.I.P. NVDA
love how people think any positive news could move this stock. very cute. GL out there today. WHAT TIME RED?!
Just wait till $400 everything falling in place
GME will be higher than NVDA tomorrow at the close. Just watch how simple this “game” is!
GM QCUM AMD INTC all warned of chip shortages. NVDA will be next. All stocks crashed
"NVDA will be down $25 tomorrow to around $550, it’s 50 day MA. Trade accordingly. Earnings are going to be an absolute disaster for longs! Save this post!!!!"
If the stock was split so many people would jump on board. It’s a mental thing. Buying now or later has no difference in # of shares but from a psychological standpoint(if a 4/1 split was announced at $555) people will jump in at $138.75 with both feet.
Buying some more.
"Hey Kevin (just asking for a friend), did the repo man come get your Bugatti this morning?"
"NO STOCK, I repeat  NO STOCK  falls $80 right before earnings if they have good  numbers! Numbers were leaked at $614!"
"I immediately mute the Ponzi, Bubble, Burn etc. Spammers!Bye Bye"
"DC growth is not going to slow down as more applications centered at the cloud grows and more companies move towards the cloud. DC and video is only going to grow. This false narrative that DC growth might slow is ridiculous, we are in the early innings of an extra inning game, NVDA position is going to strengthen on all fronts."
Will NVIDIA break out to new ALL TIME high next week? YES!
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE! LIFE IS GOD MY FRIENDS! LIFE IS GOOD! DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON A REGULAR WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASISALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
Nothing above but euphoric speculations. Below? Much technical correction.
Bingo time at the Home
"HEY  EVERYONE: Just wanted to let you all know that Free-DUMB has 6500 shares of NVDA, most bought around these levels, so he’s lost $455,000 in two weeks. You all listening to him?"
"LOL  Don’t any of you rookies know how to read options charts? I was an AMEX trader for 15+ years, if you couldn’t see this stock had 0% chance of rising after earnings, then you should invest in a CD "
I feel bad for the weak hands who sold today. Nothing has changed in the company nothing for the negative that is.if you ever sell on market pull backs its because you haven't done your DD.
Ask the owners of Qualcomm how they felt holding long into all time highs into supply constrained earnings
He told you so last Friday
$519 buy order filled. Selling at $525. Let's go !
What happened to Needhams Rajvinder Gill. He left it to cramer to pump the stock or what.
"$510 close today, Kevin shorts are shot."
There’s a $10 drop in 10!MINUTES!!! BWAHAHAHA
Hey people you don't understand. Nvidia chip is a huge dinosaur. Intel Xe with its sleek chiplet design is the future.
Still laughing  thinking about $615 last week and $602 last night in after hours ROTFLMAO  Bwaaaa 
"It’s funny that the shorts get mad that longs post analyst price upgrades and good news on here. Shorts call long pumpers even though they are putting real info out. While they spread rumors, lies , and make claims that it’s gonna tank on no basis or thesis to why. You guys are the worst and I’m glad the shorts get beat down so often."
Nvidia surging...again. Load up longs.
Sorry to say that today will most likely be a big sell off day for most stocks.
Is it too late to buy a share into nvidia?
Apple went up 7 bucks today. Buy both!
Bought Boeing and Disney. Cramer was spot on on both of those picks. He will be right about NVDA also.
"Want to be rich like me, Lanny? Just go in every message board on Yahoo that you are about to buy or short, and so the exact opposite of everyone else"
Kevin why you claim Nvidia missed earnings? I at least try to keep some sort of decency..
"I called the $504 gap 1000x, probably more, @ $615, and you all laughed. Right to $463! How about this gem: NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite"
$542....Give me $545 today. I am still not selling. KevintheLooooooser is buying dinner. $504 never came and I may sue him. I heard Rudy Guiliani is available.
"I was just a grape preserve, the last time nvda romped 10%. But I do remember that day because I walked in here the afternoon before and told y’all to buy calls. I’m not saying this thing will do that today. This is worthless. But I remember those days."
$800 PT? Cant even hold $600 
"Trying to catch falling knife hurts, make it stop please."
"Cathy Wood from ARK like her 250,000 shares of TSLA she bought the past few days? Her fund will lose 50% this month and she will have so many redemptions that she will have to close the fund down"
picked up some at the time of capital hill riot 508 was a great price
After 5 months here I have the feeling that a gypsy sold me a lame horse.
@LarryTheLegend said it was closing at $504 today 
"Other than Google, all FAANNG stonks have been R.I.P. for over 1/2 a year. Checking accounts pay 20% better. The quicker you finally come to terms that NVDA is done going up, and you find another stonk to invest, then you will feel much better. I own MU & WDC, bought them both 50% ago only because they never moved during the huge run up from March until August."
I don’t think there’s a sell off happening. Usually starts by now after earnings. Yesterday was the sell off.
weekly chart still looks south
Buy @ 400 and then hold for 5 years
SHORTED 557 and 535 today 
Look at the collapsing price of this dog stock but don't look at the ten years before that time. I need you to sell so that I can cover my initial short at $140 per share then I can move out of my mom's basement.
MU is trying to catch up. Did @Legend short MU...that would explain the action.
Where are all the guys saying it was going to 700 or 1000 lol. Glad I sold before earnings
"we can deny the fact that NVDA is a great company, but techs are very on verge right now, I'd love to get in at another safer point"
Ladies & germs  what time red 9:30:01am EST is my lock of the century
"Pls get ready for 472 support, and don't miss the buys at 336."
Next stop the 50 dma at 542.
WOW  WOW  WOW  NVDA “only” down $40 now! Congrats to all longs
"Just think  longs, NVDA only has to rally 22% from here to break even from two weeks ago LOL "
GME will go to $500 easy NVDA $299Save this post
"What NVidia really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for NVidia (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"NVDA will be down $40-$50 today by the close. I call this an “air pocket” stock. Once bitcoin tanks, and it will, NVDA will be $299 again!"
just ride the wave..
Shorted more $557.75 Easy money. Also buying put options here. Anyone sell the 600 weekly calls for $25 like I did?
You have to be in it to win it. Glad I bought NVDA a year ago.
@Darth Trader sewer boy. any idea what post report fluctuation is? you arent winning anything
"I have some NVDA. However, it is looking poised to run, so buying more. The chip shortage and the dominant GPU position is ready to gel."
I think I am done with this sector. AMD and NVDA are both underperforming my other investments. I’m getting out of chips
NASDAQ up 70NVDA down $6Asking for a good friend named Uncle Miltie
Best thing to do is to sell
NASDAQ NOW AT LOWS OF THE YEAR AND WE ARE IN MARCH LOL  Welcome  to Blow Jiden
too many daytraders I guess (for now) ...https://finance.yahoo.com/m/d46c3758-9269-334c-a120-52a828a8b2c0/this-is-the-hottest-growth.html?.tsrc=fin-srch
Conclusion: index funds like ARK buy hundreds of thousands of lowly stocks daily. The common investor is watching and jumps on the bandwagon. Index funds then pull their money making big dollars.
$530 will be the new forever high in NVDA save this post
"OMG  When NASDAQ was up 50 this am NVDA was $557, now NASDAQ is up 60 and NVDA is $543"
"Nvidia's chip is a huge monolith chip. Intel Xe is a sleek new design chiplet. Xe is the future, Nvidia is the past."
"I can't wait for the results tonight. There may be a lot of crow going around. If I'm wrong, I made the decision, it's all on me and I'll take the loss, and congratulate the shorties; well played. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not sure if you can say the same for some of these shorties."
Legend shorted this and lost again rofl
We’ll see if Kevin still posts every second after institutions pump this stock up to 800 this year
"Nvidia price target raised to $660 from $605 at JPMorgan JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $660 from $605 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The company reported ""strong"" Q4 results, says the analyst, who continues to see an upward bias in earnings estimates as we move through 2021."
can nvda bounce back to 500 by options expiration tomorrow?that would be nice and helpful500+ be even better
"Anyone own my GME? Remember at $39 I said GME would go back to $500 to $1000, and NVDA was $614 and I begged you to short? GME is going to $1000 minimum btw"
There is a better chance of hitting Powerball 100 weeks in a row than NVDA $564
"If this thing can somehow get above that 526 intraday high, I think it'll go green by the close."
What happened just now? Any news ?
The do not call Nvidia Ngreedia for nothing. Jensen Huang and Co. are milking each and every cent out of the chips shortage. Earnings will be amazing.
NVDA drops  faster than a prom dress  & panties  on a warm summer eve
beat on both top and bottom line and guided higher for current quarter...no reason this should be down...light volume in pre-market...lots of price targets raised NVDA will be back in the $600's
You hold a stonk in NVDA that has fallen from 615 to 495 in a week since terrible  god awful  earnings and could hardly bounce a penny
Looked it up : the completion of the acquisition of mellanox took 1 year. So if the knowitalls who claim the arm deal will fail get it right we should see a block long before that. If one of the regulators releases their decision the stock will spike no matter what the outcome is and that's when TA becomes usless.
"2cd upgrade of the Day:""Cowen & Co. analyst Matthew Ramsay maintains NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a Outperform and raises the price target from $600 to $665."" Treasury rate increase has big guys in a dither."
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS
my long-term view on nvda is a decade and morethru good times and badis what it isthis shtstorm will soon pass
I have NEVER EVER seen a stock down $50 after blowout earnings and upping guidance HUGE in over 30 years of trading. Congratulations to all the weak margined novices that made me a small fortune today
"Hoping to not wake up to NVDAs favorite number $519 ever again. I swear I woke up and checked my stocks, and 9/10 times in the last month NVDA said 519. I hate that number. 619 sounds way better..."
"It's going to break 500, and then 472 support. Mark my words. Don't mess with my charts."
The stock will be just fine without arm and if the deal goes through then the stocks doubles in a quarter
If you sell $514 here you will never regret it ever trust me you will be thanking me forever
Buybuybuy Buybuybuy then buy more

"This is the value narrative wall street is trying to use to con you out of your high tech mega growth stocks. The 10 yr. yield will not stay above 1.60 for any sustained period of time as the world is starved for yield and will buy our treasuries before that happens. Wall street is shorting the 10yr. They are trying to make you into ""VALUE"" bag holders and fleece you of your mega tech stocks!!! Do not sell technology and put sell orders in 100 points above the current price of NVDA so they cannot borrow shares against your stock to short.Look at Japan we are far more at risk for deflation. Bad environmental policy and taxes are what's making things like oil / gas, groceries and lumber look elevated.

"The reason 9 of 10 stocks sell off 20% after earnings no matter how good they are is like when someone tells you a movie is great, and your expectations are so high, it’s never as good as you think it’s going to be. NVDA is in the same ballpark into earnings! Look for disappointment like last earnings no matter how good things look!"
How many times did I tell you amateur traders that NVDA had a $504 gap to fill?
This is going to get scooped around the rest of the world overnight on all major markets would be a good guess. Only going to take one upgrade to launch it.
Watch  this theory: NVDA misses and warns to bring down the stock price SO they don’t look  too dominate in their quest for ARM
What a gift!

"I believe it’s pure manipulation. Five days ago NVDA was at $580. They reported a blow out quarter. Probably the best quarter ever, and it’s sitting at $513???"
We need some massive downgrades in NVDA and huge price target  cuts from $800 to $200
Down $105 this week isn’t enough need down $200!!!!
Anyone buy $523 @ 8pm EST in after hours last night or $463 before noon 
"oops: Shares in Intel fell as much as 9% on Friday, after the company said its corporate website was hacked, pushing the chipmaker to release its fourth-quarter earnings earlier than planned. George Davis, Intel's chief financial offer, told the Financial Times a hacker gained unauthorized access to sensitive data tied to its earnings report that was set to be published after the market close on Thursday. But upon finding out about the attack, the chipmaker released its results six minutes before the market close.""An infographic was hacked off of our PR newsroom site,"" Davis told the newspaper. ""We put our earnings out as soon as we were aware."" Without providing further details, he said the breach was caused by an unlawful action that didn't involve any unintentional disclosure by Intel."
"banjo sees a ""bearish chart""...I pull up the one year chart and it is less than 5% off its ath ah....Really? Too many mushrooms I guess."
"CNBS just pumped NVDA, I can take $400 profit now or wait till $1000. I will wait for $545 sell."
I sold off all my shares this morning at $552.01 three weeks shy of holding for four years with a 5x return . I still believe shares have $125 in upside over the next 12 months but my personal situation( I'm 58 on a medical pension that runs out at age 65) so yesterday's 8% drop had me rethink the risk of holding
Nothing can bring the big digital corporations to fall since they profit massive from the plandemic
$400 fair price over next two weeks
My Boeing will be higher than NVDA by 2022

#FACTS NVDA $589 in AugustNVDA $591 mid February NASDAQ +5000 in that time frame 
NVDA fell $100 without an uptick rose from 519 to 520 and I read posts that said it might be green by the close. It’s going to $300 this month
I can’t take this life anymore Breakers in Palm Beach  for a month $2500 a night pool/ocean/food/golf/abuse NVDA everyday non stop  ALL ON YOUR DIME
But hey Gamestop is up 45% now so the world still makes sense LOL.
Weird how no one ever listened to the facts that I presented them with 1000x. The proverbial cat  have all your tongues? After earnings NVDA will fall $200. Save this brilliance
"OK now everyone let’s see down $50 today, where she belongs. So down $10 right now, to around $600, it was $589 last August. A bank  pays better"
Bought 500 QCOM at $147. Valuation matters.
$552 - $537 Told you rookies at $552 the gap $532 has to be filled No way around it
Nvidia chip is a HUGE dinosaur soon to be extinct. Intel's Sleek new chiplet design Xe is the future. Just so you all know.
NASDAQ GETTING PUMMELED AGAIN.BUY TECHNOLOGY STOCKS!NVIDIA SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN......YOU'LL NEVER PICK MARKET BOTTOMS.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAINCHOO CHOO
It's been a couple of months since I checked the conversations being posted on the NVDA site. I can't believe the amount of garbage being posted here. Very disappointed.
you make me want to roll my windows down and cruise.
Hey  bagholders how’s that $547 looking????
Who is this Larry everyone keeps talking about?
I'd love to see 530 close today
"Bitcoin's energy use, and hence its CO2 production, are spiraling upwards.""It's very bad that all this energy is being literally wasted in a lottery."" DUH"
I think Freedom and Hellraiser should go see a counselor. Then they can kiss and make up and be buddies again.
sort of disturbing when NVDA has a 5x greater loss in AH than TSLA.
Options control the price of stonks but I am sure all you bag  holders realize that 550 pin  is their goal  Was blindly obvious even @ 615 just learn how to read volume & open interest. WHY do you think  NVDA fell $50 after earnings? Because 95% of all options bought before earnings were call options
weak hands are being shaken off and the train moving fast up at opening..
Nvidia is back to being a gaming stock. No reason for such high valuations.
I'm confused... isn't Xmax in december? HAHA thanks for the nice discount
I guess you need those Diamond hands for the nvda.
"HUGE article out today on NVDA in IBD, very well written, says NVDA is not a buy right now. Read the article, back out of here and go to NVDA Yahoo news  it’s the first article. It’s long but VERY well constructed. Sell NVDA now!"
Will close $550 That’s where all the options are Watch & learn
No one in the world  would dare hold stocks over a weekend
Kevin down another $20 million.
Post this 40X/week
Nvidia has reached the bottom
It's not going red atleast today!! Go green! $550 next week!!
"I guess I'm one of those ""buy and hold"" old timers. All of you guys are fretting over what the stock does in a day or a few hours. ""Short now"", ""buy now"" and ""to the moon"" statements are causing me much nausea. I was fortunate enough to buy part of my holdings in 2017 at roughly $90 per share. Continued to add through the following few years with last purchase being right before the Covid drop last year. I'm more than happy with where my investment currently sits and what the future holds moving forward."
Buy on the dips its very easy!!!
Where you at Legend? hahahahah
Unexplained drop in technology illogical drop in technologySome say it’s interest rates some say it’s yields or bonds.Insiders taking your 2020 gains in technology away from you. Even fang Tesla can’t defeat the carnage.Bleeding out
Hold and buy NVDA for the next decade and grow rich with all the long investors. Don't be like Larry and miss out on all the wealth.
anything Kathie woods touches of Ark is 100% going down
Want to know my theory? I think NVDA insiders sell like crazy to keep the stock down so the stock/company doesn’t get so big it looks like a monopoly and they can get the ARM deal done
We are very close to next support level of $500 in coming sessions. Most investors won't believe me.
That $502 was a fake trade today for sure
Shorting $491 here I think she hits $299 in March. 200 day moving average is now breached for good
"NVDA got very bearish charts. Check it out. Funds selling, but retail filling the bag like no tomorrow."
"Just wait until they break into the healthcare industry powering ai driven medical instruments, this stock is future proof, their chips will drive innovation across many future industries they haven’t even tapped yet"
kevin da klown has far bigger issues to deal with than the stock market
roughly half way off the impulse lows and highs
"seems to me that the treasury bond interest rates rising a few days ago spooked the market. apparently, when rates rise, people are more prone to leave stocks and seek the safety of bonds. the FED unspooked the market by saying the rises were likely just temporary. or perhaps they used the word fleeting. anyway the market has been on edge anyways, and this morning treasury rates went up again, which i think is the spark that led to today's market downturn. just my hunch."
reiterate my prediction at the open $625 and close at.$675
NVIDIA reached an all time high at 594.99
Price to sales ratio 25....bubble territory. Love the company but the valuation compared to say AVGO is absurd.
If you didn’t sell NVDA $540 exactly at huge resistance with the 50 day MA then you fell victim to one of the 7 deadly sins: GREED
"600's before we have the usual upgrades from at least 6 analysts into earnings, we may have price targets as high as 750 soon imo"
"Nvidia (NVDA) – Price target raised to $700 from $600 at Oppenheimer Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer raised the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $700 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of the company’s Q4 results on February 24. The analyst sees upside to consensus estimates for Q4 and Q1, led by GeForce gaming GPU as demand for Ampere continues to outstrip supply. He sees supply tightness lingering at least into Q2."
EXPLOSIVE! Broke out technically. Onward to higher HIGHS! All time high now!
NVDA 615 to 510 in a week -105 and still tankingBottomless pit 2 more weeks like this and $300
Kathie Woods ARK down 40% in 2021 top hold she’s been puking  out is NVDA redemptions tax selling margin calls etc all at once
KEVIN
Huangthecon
3 good days on the nasdaq and it's 600's again. Kevin and co burnt their fingers once...it will happen again.
$615 to $535 is what percentage loss? Hold please. Every $61 is 10% so down around 15% this month ROTFLMFAO 
This could very well break its recent ath and touch 600 before earnings. Shorts are heading for the exit and upgrades are coming.

"Even I'm surprised by the number of stocks getting hammered in this selloffs. It appears so savage, ruthless and nasty. Around and around the correction goes and where it stops no one knows."
"NVDA was $545 before last blowout earnings now $550. It was $589 last August. It was $615 last week. Great company, bad stock."
let's all buy 50 shares each right now
Long and Strong baby!!!
Buying at 504
"Dear Navidiadicts,Cramer is dangerous. People have lost billions under his so-called guidance. Avoid his so-called market intel as you would a house afire. Motley Fools are always right until they're wrong, which is the case 90% of the time. List to the advice of someone who is right 90% of the time and went wrong, admits it promptly. NVDA has peaked, pure and simple. Stockholders and interested investors should select one of Following options:✓place protective stop 2 to 3% below the opening price on Monday✓Sell the stock sometime within the first hour on Monday and replace it with a stock that has much better prospects for growth. There are many to choose from.✓ option your stock If you are concerned about capital gains or have chosen to hang on long-term.✓buy the March 29 $50 Puts and close that position at 25% gain before next Friday (control your greed and take your profits even though it will probably double this coming week) You will see a minimum of 25% appreciation in those puts by Tuesday at 10: 45 at latest.This is not a pitch to improve my personal position It is out of concern for those who are too attached to this particular stock and face steep losses. It's because I care. Thank you for listening.I am a private investor with 45 years experience. I do not offer advice as a professional and highly suggest you do your own homework. Study the chart, look at the recent price action, sector rotation, etc.Ok?"
"OH NO....I sold ALL my NVDA at $460!!! Oh wait, nevermind, I actually have a spine and won't sell for many years! I did pick up a couple more shares at $472 though so all is good. We'll be back to $600 in no time flat! Good luck longs!"
The NASDAQ would have to rise a billion points from here for longs in NVDA to break even from 2 weeks ago
Infrastructure will be next and that will pop the economy big time with the 5 trillion will be putting into that. Not a 10 year plan but a 4 year deal so 1.25 trillion more per year next 4 years. 100% American materials (ie steel lumber etc) and all union work with even subs very strictly set to union standards Trumpka very happy there with afl-cio. Lot of revenue for this come from a Wall Street transaction tax and with a nice 3 year additional gas tax with its side benefit of forcing people to more fuel efficient vehicles which will be subsidized. Watch GM get huge subsidies to re open plants like Lordstown and Janesville to build new electric and fuel cell vehicles. New sherif in town and elections have consequences. Oil not worth $10 barrel in 3 years
NVDA is down more than my other shorts TSLA CRWD PYPLI made more money today than any day in 30 years LOTTO DAY
"NVDA ER (Earnings) expected on Feb 11, 2021. Relax longs and best wishes."
"YOU DON'T SHORT THIS STOCK, how hard is that to understand. It's a 1K stock, sometime soon too.."
Anyone ever in their wildest dreams at $557+ up $15+ think we would be WHAT TIME RED with the market at highs of the day?????
cover Larry
Is there a possibilty to buy call options on LarryTheLegend's time on NVDA MB? That would def be a life-changing investment.
Did Mr Jen Huang just sell 24m worth of shares?
"ok, let's move to $600+ ......."

"Bottom is in, Not"
Was DOWN 47 the earnings you have all been waiting months for? Be honest! NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
Short more $487 and bought 470 puts expiring today
"Just remember one thing people, which is ""this stock has NO TOP !!!"" !"
only bad earning go up and good earning tanks - the new way of trading...
"Here’s reality rookies: NVDA was $545 two earnings ago 6 months ago both total blowouts both upped guidance and $467 Friday. NVDA was $589 with the NASDAQ at 9000, went to 14,175 and NVDA was $550. Asking for a friend loserTARDS"
NVDA is the only stonk I ever shorted in 30+ years that fell $150 after getting 100 upgrades
$6 TOAST lol
gme is cratering so fast they put a halt to itbut kevin already sold and went short
"Remember $615? Oh yeah, that was a few days ago"
"I want to request everyone to use your own brain not paid sheep analysts. Will they give u money when stock goes down ?All Analysts are paid by funds, banks n companies. No one is immune from corruption."

At this pace NVDA will be 504 by Friday I hope Remember 589 last August?Well $589 now
this company makes 5 billion this qt and stock is down apple makes record profit qt stock is down gme goes bankrupt stock is up 100 percent everyday smh please tell the investor like me how thats economically possible lol goes to show its all a gamble after 25 years trading thats what really sucks
"Let me the first one to say this is going to $1,000. Yes laugh at me today and regret it later. Your call"
"Nvidia price target raised to $672 from $643 at TruistTruist analyst William Stein raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $672 from $643 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares as part of a broader research note on semis. The analyst also selects the stock as one of his best growth ideas for 2021, highlighting the company for its opportunity in parallel compute applications like server acceleration / AI, gaming, and eventually autonomous driving. Stein adds that he sees Nvidia as being ""driven less by the raw performance of its chips, and more by its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and software investment""."
"From wccftech:""Some retailers in Europe have even hiked prices of the RTX 3060 up to a massive $835 USD (or $689 EUR) which is absolutely insane considering it is almost three times the original MSRP at this point."" Yow!"
See you in the 300s.
If rates rise NVDA falls. Just the way it works. If rates fall back NVDA GOES UP 50%
Cathie Wood's ARK bought another 9951 shares last week
Anyone see $519 this am? $488 now going under $300 this month
Fed is pumping liquidity into the market. It goes up now
Sluggish. Might not embark on its next run above 550 until a few weeks prior to ER in May.
Wait until 350 to get IN. It was 180 last year
NVDA back to same prices in June of 2020 almost a year ago
"@TK12.. Great day, huh? ;-)Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
Can you believe they’re still trying to sell 600calls? Seriously. Those were worth 100++ about a week ago? I see .40 for next Friday. Imagine that feeling of watching that swirl
I don’t understand who could still be selling at this point
"Keep shorting shorts, another target just hit! Up market tomorrow in tech will be head fake. Cover near $400"

"Stock is way oversold...you're telling me Nvidia isn't worth more after the 3000 series released? During a global pandemic where most people stayed home and were more interested in building a PC or gaming than in the past? Of course if I buy, the stock will go down, as is tradition."
"Undoubtedly one of the worst stocks in the market. Has been one for the last 6 months or so. Moves up in sporadic, haphazard way, never building any kind of momentum, all compounded by the fact that, unlike Roku, Msft amd and Tsla , one hardly ever hears any news from the company that might lift the stock. Wouldn’t touch it again."

"Evercore ISI says Nvidia remains top growth idea in semis after earnings Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said Nvidia's results and guidance came ""in in-line if not better than buyside expectations,"" but its outlook for the ""all-important Data Center business disappointed on the margin."" However, "" taking a step back - it's really not that bad,"" said Muse, who thinks a hyperscale recovery in the Data Center starting in the calendar second quarter should provide a nice tailwind on top of the strength being seen across key verticals. Muse reiterates his Outperform rating and $675 price target on Nvidia, which he said remains his top growth idea in semiconductors."
Selloff #2
Where have all the shorts gone?
"RIP Kevin, it was a good run... ""NVDA will be down $10+ at one point tomorrow or I never post again"""
Tomorrow will pass 600
Nobody is complaining today about Huang and how NVDA is manipulated....all nonsense. Enjoy the ride. Semi mergers and takeovers are real.
Ascending pattern still intact Kevin. Learn to read a chart
Told these perma bulls 1000x NVDA would be down $50. Well $42 so far and not even close to a bottom. I may have to adjust that to down $100! Even TWLO the only stock to trade up $50 after earnings gave it all back in two days! 9 of 10 stocks reporting TANK after earnings! The reality of earnings always kills momentum stocks
$519 huh? That is the all time high forever save this post
Other big chip competitors are afraid of Nvidia's ARM moves - Congrat Jensen... Nice move.
Let me be the first to congratulate all NVDA bag  holders from last August. You just broke even 589
Why is this a surprise? You want Democrats this is exactly what you get and there is no bottom
I don’t think  I’ve ever been short a stock that falls $50 intra day with no gap almost everyday for 2 weeks
Really rallying nicely from the lows. Money managers knew they could get a nice return at these levels.
"We've jettisoned stage one paper hands. Stage two engines ready to deploy for diamond hands. Prepare for stratosphere exit in five, four, three, two, one. All systems go for "
What’s with all the semi conductor chip shortage with many auto companies? Is this business NVDA supplies?
"Will see $1,000 soon"
"10 year is now 1.47, I am calling a bottom for now. Buy."
"Squidly, are you in here?"
nvda will test $1000 this year!
HP had a blowout Q as well and it's up 1% while the nasdaq tanks by 4%. Today's nvda action is clearly a planned raid and I bet big money is accumulating at these levels. It'll get better.
"Wipe em (Shorts) out ! Instead of “LarryTheLegend” (better known as: LarryTheClown) getting his 10 perfect 10 Call Girls, “LarryTheLegend” (better known as: LarryTheClown) will BE THE “CALL GIRL” !Albeit no 10 but that’s what some of The BoyZ like !"
"We're at the same level as before the ARM news, the blowout Q3, various contracts, design wins and upgrades Historically we get a run up a few weeks before earnings."
Kevin go short intel
"$510 order filled, order to sell at $525, hopefully tomorrow with option shenanigans."
WATCH NVIDIA CLIMB TO $750+ BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS.
it is going to be a nice start to the week
so happy to be above $500 that was a brutal two week long ride
But it wasn’t overpriced at 615 according to the pumpers!!!
"NVDA now under, for anyone who charts, “her” 10, 20, 50 & now 100 day moving averages, and 200 day moving up as this drops around $450, once that gets taken out after earnings, look  out below, possibly $299!"
WHAT TIME IS IT? IT’S NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!!!!NVIDIA BLASTING OFF!!!
The range in NVDA is $130 priced in after earnings so around $430 to the downside
WHO BOUGHT SHARES TODAY? WHAT A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY WITH THE NASDAQ SELLING!CONGRATULATIONS NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!
"Im holding,the narrative and growth story has not changed,in fact its even better"
it's about time to adding more shares of NVDA. the future is so bright for long long term investment. The demand in crypto and EV are huge for next 10 years.
this volatility have to stop !!! nvda to stay above 600 where it suppose to be !!!
Earning are late...accounting problems?
"I guess Cathie Wood is not buying NVDA today. Chop, chop !"
BUY NVIDIA NOW
Always wonder how many calls were sold by the market makers that they now want to lower the price to zero them out. Doesn’t seem like a lot of shares traded in the AH that took it down. We’ll see who blinks first tomorrow and Friday. Hopefully many here bought some short term downside protection.
Not to worry about the drop. Needhams Rajvinder Gill will raise his price target tomorrow and we'll fly.
Double bottom goes right to 1 trillion market cap!!
buy today cuz this is going to be 675 by the 25th
Back over $500! We’re back in the saddle again!

NVDA is now $4 from where it traded last August. Checking accounts pay better. But keep trying to tell everyone how great it is! #FACTS
Just bought my first share can not wait to see what the next 12 months bring!
CRAMER SAID NVDA WILL BE DOWN NEXT TWO DAYS THEN ITS TIME TO BUY
hold that 200 ma.
NVDA was up 20 percent in one month and shorts are like it’s down 5 percent the last few days. Like come on y’all.
Hint to longs: look at the put/call volume and open interest on a stock before buying into earnings. Do the opposite of the “Joe Public”.
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!NVIDIA READY TO BLAST OFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS! NEXT STOP $700$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN
30 point swing! Awesome. The bottom has been reached. Time to soar. Weak hands waved the white flag. Time for serious Investors to make money. Vamos! 
Blow Away earnings coming down the tube
Short HUGE 557 & 535 now shorting 539 here. NVDA will be under 500 tomorrow on their terrible earnings
$620 close next week. the pullback is temporary.
Gamestop is up 300% in 4 days btw. And it's not a profitable company. Modern times.
Thoughts pn earning guys?
NVDA has almost tripled in price in the past 12 months. $400 seems more appropriate for now.$600 by the end of 2021.$800 by the end of 2022.
No wonder new price targets are $700. Good job longs that got in early.
"Definitely a frustrating stock at the moment, especially for new share holders. Hopefully earnings will make a difference and the stock isn't just waiting for ARM news which is probably a year away."
"Possibly tax related selling by Robinhood investors of NVDA and TSLA shares to pay taxes in April ? Relax longs - Jensen beat and raised estimates. After this tax selling, it should rocket right back up. Best to all. My opinions only. Relax."
tomorrow closes above $578
Pull up the 6 month chart NVDA on Yahoo exactly 532 six months ago then pull up the NASDAQ chart up 40%
$517 is the all time forever high in NVDA for the rest of our lives! Please buy INTC and short NVDA
How is NVDA only down $2 in after hours? HOW? Will be down $50 tomorrow minimum

2 upgrades and down 11 points ? Keeping my shares thanks.
"Think about this: How soon will there be enough GPU's for everyone? Even if Nvidia never releases a new product again and just keeps making the current, how long will it last? My point is, I plan to be long for at least that much time, which is a lot."
Nvidia is king. All hail the king!

"And this isn’t even priced in.“We are making good progress toward acquiring Arm, which will create enormous new opportunities for the entire ecosystem,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement."
They’ll do whatever it takes to make sure Friday closes below 600 so calls/put can expire... but they can’t stop the earnings rally that’ll definitely blow NVDA past 700

A few days ago there was a silver shortage... Now there is plenty of silver. Its all a game to get the Reddit traders to squeeze the shorts in the chip stocks.
Looks like the PPT is in full control they needed to stop another tech wreck . LOL

"You all own a stock that beat earnings by a mile upped guidance huge got 20 substantial upgrades by very influential firms, and NVDA hasn’t had an uptick since, SO why would the stock ever trade higher again?"
I repeat NVDA is peaked and signal for market run is over too. I have seen this for many times. Be careful

"more fear from interest rates rising, competing with stocks. it's like they think all investors are going to sell their stocks and jump on the bargain for a 1.5% yield of a 10-year treasury. silliness, and this too, will pass. just bad luck and bad timing. an excellent quarter from nvda. hold onto your shares. nvda shares are an asset that will only get more valuable. i will go out on a limb and predict nvda will give investors more than 1.5%/year. good luck out there."

"Was originally planning on building a PC, but NVDA 30's graphics cards were literally no where to be seen. Which then led me down an insane rabbit hole of silicon issues, cryptocurrency miners, scalpers, botters, AI, automation, machine intelligence, video games (so many like me building their first pc build), that I feel even after the insane gains the company saw in its stock price this past year it still has room to run. Either that or I've gone full blown crazy..."
"If NVDA warned on next quarter's earnings, it would go to $700 by week's end."
"the more you buy the more you save, that triggered the largest buying rush in NVIDIA history. now out CEO says he's getting the arm deal done. hold on bros $1000 this time next year."
Buy this stock after the bankruptcy in a month or two. This stock is going to $15.
Please short sellers consider taking into your home some Nvidia longs that get totally wiped out. It is hard to see NVDA longs down on their luck and homeless.

"I just need a good laugh  here, who bought NVDA @ $615 last week?"
a very up day today. but ain't nothing to worry about folks because there is a severe shortage of chips around the world and nvidia is so important manufacturer. I say with utmost confidence buy more. Yo want more than nvidia then buy a mutual fund such as FSELX from Fidelity . There are other great family of funds too offering a semi conductor mutual fund I believe.
strange day for sure....America has become the place where truth has been replaced with delusion

As soon as the 10-YR T-Note yield reverses and heads back toward 1.60% NVDA will head lower. Enjoy this bump while it lasts.

"OMG  Day after day week after week month after month hundreds of millions in call options bought in NVDA non stop (no put options) and obviously options run contrarian, SO NVDA (TURD ) drops like a rock daily and all the options holders get wiped out......"

"Nvidia after-hours weakness a buying opportunity, says Jefferies Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis noted that Nvidia shares traded lower in after-market trading following the company's earnings report despite its January quarter EPS and its April quarter EPS outlook being consensus, which he thinks is because data center revenue was flattish quarter-over-quarter and concerns that Crypto is driving gaming upside. However, he believes that data center is in a ""digestion period,"" and notes that the last digestion period was a good buying opportunity, adding that he views after-hours weakness in the shares ""as a particularly buying opportunity."" Lipacis has a Buy rating and $680 price target on Nvidia shares. (the fly)"
UNBELIEVEABLE bounce back

mind boggling earnings and outlook....don't miss it
"Ark Invest believes that Bitcoin will skyrocket. Tesla just bought $1.5 billion Bitcoin.When the price of Bitcoin goes up, more people will want to mine it, which increases demand for Nvidia graphics cards, and makes it more difficult for regular customers to buy them. Go look around on YouTube, and you'll find gamers complaining about not being able to buy the 3000 series graphics cards because they're going to Bitcoin miners. The insane demand is also driving the prices up. It's gotten to the point that Nvidia is now re-releasing the old Pascal series because they cannot meet the demand for the new cards."
"Engage Beast Mode, over. "
Next resistance is $150. We got this!
the very day nvda hit it's 463 impulse lows i repeatedly stated a 50% retrace to 540 is the first target
615 to 482 ROTFLMFAO Please tell me that no one believed $502 this morning

Screen  shot  $492. For it will never ever be this high ever again

Somebody knows whats coming AH. Assume your positions.
BUY NVIDIA!GREAT DAY TO BE A BUYER!NASDAQ DRAGGING DOWN GREAT STOCKS!
"Discipline. Sell at alltime highs, upgrades and pre earnings!!!!!"
Back in the day a huge earnings beat with upgrades would send an equity into orbit. Wow look how things have changed. Two words: criminal manipulation
"Let's talk about investing in the semiconductor sector. Ask yourself if you have the stones for it. Nvidia and other semi and semi equipment stocks are volatile. Nvidia once peaked at 290 or so only to plummet back to 140 then surged up to the recent high over $600/share. The historical price graph isn't smooth and linear but rather more of imperfect sawtooth. Our resident short caller isn't wrong, let's call him Kevin for the sake of discussion, in this respect Nvidia will surge and retrench in cycles. I've ridden this stock and other similar stocks that will make you want to wear an extra pair of undershorts from the open of premarket to the close of the afterhour session. I'm used it and have been nicely rewarded. Buy when the price offers an opportunity as an investor. Trade the volatility if you prefer because the vol is there if that is how you want to roll. There is something here for everyone."
"What we need is that EU inquiry on the ARM acquisition to go away. Once that happens, you'll see some nice upward movement, big!"
All hail Jensen he hit it out of the park...

"OK, entire market is down. But it's a little backwards when the 20 stocks on my primary watch board, only X has has a greater pct drop; and NVDA is 3x pct loss greater than NASDAQ. I did shift to greater than 50% cash a few weeks back due to a lot of fear mongering of an imminent market crash. No plans to add to anything; but will keep cash handy."
"Waaaay overvalued. Gaming losing to RADEON, no datacenter gains, no major supercomputer wins, AI/ML losing to RADEON and intc. FPGA will take over as well. No arm deal. Nvda will be 150b market cap in two years. Mark my word."
Got a great fill on my short 557 plus weekly 550 puts NVDA R.I.P.
615 to 450 in two weeks. Congrats  to all of those who voted  for Weekend At Bernies
Sell and short. It's just BLIP

"Oh dear, looks like the shorts are losing their religion going into the close. Makes you wonder why eh?"
VIPUL NVDA $515 or AVGO $495 or LRCX $603?????
This is the new support level. I firmly believe $660 gets hit tomorrow or possibly even today.
It’s good seeing a stock crash  on HUGE volume and no news right before earnings. 
hope this brake 500 so ylmy hair will grow back again lol

Remember I was telling you guys to go long GME and short NVDA/and almost everyone in here made fun of me/GME $200 NVDA $450
NVDA $615 to $460 down $155 LOL in literally less than two weeks without an uptick
Anyone remember $519? VIPUL all your profits from your last 100 trades wiped out
Trending on yahoo yesterday was an article that the United States government was buying more and more chips for its usage and experiencing a shortage. What does that mean? It means that the chip sector has to increase production and hence increase sales and profitability.
Longs!!
Don't be fooled by the shorties on this board!
"yo it will turnaround and go to $1,000 and all them nay sayer folks will eat crow. I sayeth it because I believeth in what I sayeth. yes siri bob we went down today but Babba knows a great buyin opportunity avail it and take the opportunity and yo will be happy. Thanko"
"Breakfast is over, sure hope they don't cancel arts and crafts.One of the twins, but they are actually the same person, yesterday said he would never post again unless Nvda was down 10 during the day. So much for promises."
Is Benjo just Kevin again?
"China claims “severe shortage “, the United States Government claims shortage and GM and Ford etc etc claim shortage of chips. But Nvidia which I do and continue to do or Buy FSELX Fidelity Semiconductors. This fund includes all the companies. It is a mutual fund. I did not want to keep it a secret. I want to share the information with all of you . I am sure there are other family of funds who offer semiconductors Mutual Funds as well ."
I just can’t even comprehend or fathom that with $0 commissions that anyone would ever buy and hold a stock in 2021. So you guys know how much I have made shorting NVDA
"Another day, another NVDA decline."
"Had 10 units at 525,Added 5 again at 465 todayWill add again on big drops"
some old school green lantern action - may the green ring of power destroy the $600 price point and keep going.
"I thought a crash was supposed to happen to the market as a whole, not just one."
"Down again! Does it hit that 510 level & bounce? Seems like that's the support level. Kinda frustrating to have such a great earnings report and sell off, but that's the way its going."

When NVDA was $557 this morning I read 100 posts “it’s going to $600” VIPUL was smart enough to see it too and sell. You TARDS better learn how to read options charts and volume before spouting off

"Want to know the best thing about this????? EV and autonomy is just beginning guess who has the foot in the door with the chips that are in the EV and autonomy industry.... let me not mention gaming, Ai, VR, AR, datacenter, cloud ........ mmmmmmmmm like I said yesterday NVDA is the future that will help the future become a better future."
"Leg End , how is CRWD? DDOG? FSLY?"
NVDA is going MUCH lower than $400! You will be wishing your mommas never met your pappas at $250
share price 2024 around $2000. this $2000 price tag is the point @ which NVDA's CFO said in 2019 that they would split the stock.
"Breaking news: Kevin just got arrested at a Breakers hotel for trying to pay his bill with a stolen credit card, and for having a suitcase full of toilet paper, mini soap bars, and towels. The maids said he was a slob, and kept repeating things as he does here."
"If they can dictate price of their products, I would say PT should be $1000 by year end."
Going to gap down $50 tomorrow morning to $450. Will be $298 by Friday. Trust me
One lesson never listen to Kevin.
NVDA is controlled by options players and there are a lot of weak shareholders that are always the first to panic
WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!! CONGRATULATIONS ON BUYING TODAY!!! YOU WILL BE RICH SOON!!! HAVING A MARGARITA AND FISH TACOS HERE IN VEGAS! ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND!!!
Looking for some analyst to slap an $800 target tomorrow.
No one in the world  would ever dare buy NVDA into a weekend with the 10 year squeezing higher than GME
Its nice to see NVDA breaking out before earnings. I just wonder out loud what will happen post earnings. If NVDA runs to 610 area then where does it go after EA? Announces split & sells off?
Be nice to recoup yesterday’s pullback and Onwards and Upwards to new all time high 
nvda promptly got the whack a mole treatment on earnings
"Record quarter. Record growth. Beat estimates in every way. Plus strong bullish guidance going forward. Incredible company, outstanding stock! Super bullish here. Holding NVDA long term never disappoints."
Its making room to go up on arm deal confirmation.just hold
Ladies germs  what time red 9:30  am ET
Shake out shares to reap endless profits at expense of small investors who don't have comfort to know manipulations or honest enough to try investing?
NVDA 200 day MA badly broken Going a lot lowerI think they warn Chip glut is the rumor
NVIDIA is set for blowout earnings and a solid guidanceWall Street analysts expect NVIDIA to deliver $2.80 per share in earnings on revenue of $4.82 billion. The numbers are almost in line with the midpoint of the company's revenue guidance (issued in November) of $4.80 billion and an earnings estimate of $2.79 per share.Investors should remember that analysts were originally expecting NVIDIA to earn $2.54 per share in adjusted earnings on $4.42 billion in revenue. The chipmaker set the bar much higher when it released its fiscal third-quarter report in mid-November.
614+ to 513 in a week What’s that % loss longs?
That's all folks this will be back to 135
NVDA bag holders conference is still on time. @Raj @ Kaplesh are special invitees. Pls check your email. Bring your own coffee and chair.
The 52 week Covid low is $180 it’s going back there
"OK now, don’t get mad  at me, for I am ONLY the messenger asking for a friend: Did you all like NVDA at $557+ or here at $542 and falling, as the market hits all time highs????"
"I am repeating my 472 target with buy 336. Don't challenge my timing n charts. BTW, don't miss bag holders conference scheduled for Thursday !!"
Anyone not believing in NVIDIA future take a look at GTC 2021 content: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/topics/Deep Learning and AI touches pretty much every industry now. And it is just the beginning. And NVIDIA is in the center of it. This will be a 3T company one day.
615 to 578 LOL Down $40 so far with earnings out Wednesday LOLLLLLL
Hey Darth! $600
"nvda 3/5 490p +9,200% in three daysomg"
Jensen when the arm deal gets approved.
I want to buy NVDA at $535 for a quick $5 profit. let's go.

BUY AS MUCH NVIDIA YOU CAN EACH MONTH. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN! ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
Who owns both nio and nvdia? Yes me...  And I also own tesla for back up plan
NVDA is going to $299 this month. Buy every put option you can get your hands on. Wait until the broke RobinHood traders have to pay cap gains from 2020 and they have to liquidate
Imagine where NVDA would be if Bitcoin didn’t go from $20k to $60k when NVDA was above $600
Posted my biggest short position in years at $525 before I made the trade. Now $519. Going to $299 short term
Thumbs up if you think I should mute Kevin.

No way this finishes green going into the weekend. Everyday there's new financial news coming from the Biden administration that sends the market into a spiral and a lot of nervousness about news this weekend. I'll think about picking up more Monday but expect down into the $530s prior to close then we'll see what else happens. Also expect any ground breaking news from NVIDIA to come today after hours.
at this price... it seems a good buy
We have a winner 9:31 AM
Where’s Sir Kevin?Covering!!! 
Oh my gosh!! Look at that drop.
$600 baby let's go
I found TK12 ...

"️   ONE MORE TIME FOR ALL THE CLUELESS BROKE MARGINED ROBINHOOD NVIDIA-TARDS ARK REDDIT ROOKIES: NVDA was $589 in July of 2020, $467 in March of 2021. Your checking account has outperformed NVDA by 21%."
Bye bye 480 forever 480 will be it’s all time high Kalpesh you likey Buying a Lamborghini SUV this week
Soon it will split 1:10 and once again go back to 500 as fundamentals are so strong
There it is another call for $800! ROTFLMFAO!!! This stock will collapse after earnings. Never saw so many TARDS ever in my life
I will cover my final shares and go long next week at $297
"What time red? I say before 10am EST. I am 100% sure of it. Trade accordingly and buy the weekly 530 put options on the open like me, & don’t dare forget to sell the 600 calls for the 30th week in a row"
Out. Be back at 515
"""Full-year revenue was a record $6.70 billion, up 124 percent."""
"From Motley Fool:NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress recently pointed out that the demand for its gaming GPUs (graphics processing units) is ""off the charts."" Supply levels are likely to remain lean through the company's fiscal first quarter that ends in April, according to Kress. A shortage of components is also hurting supply, but NVIDIA is reportedly in a better position on that front as compared to rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)."
"I've been investing for decades and have NEVER seen anything like today. I was DEEPLY in the red for my portfolio and NOW I am very much in the GREEN. The volatility and panic was extreme. It pays to just sit back and let the dust settle. Investing is the hardest thing anyone can do. It requires so much patience. Lastly, it gives me EXTREME pleasure to see SHORTS lose their rear-ends. They are negative people who are GREEDY and want everyone to fail. They always end up in the grave-yard where they BELONG!"
NVDA chart since August 2020 is hilarious 
"Down $20 at some point today for sure; sorry  if you TARDS don’t heed my brilliant mathematical equation of NVDA + $564 = Superman +,Kryptonite"
12% up after opening ...or $650.00...for sure !
Nvda is setting up for a rally to the 1000 level... perfect set up with no movement the last few months. Earnings will be monstrous
"Here its is, shorts. Your big drop you all have been wishing for. LMAO."
$615 to $515 and yet all the same perm bull longs who seem to all have an endless supply of cash  screaming buy while I have been shorting like crazy 
Should I buy? Or is it too late?
Got in at 516.5 expecting a bounce at the 6mo support. This co isn’t going anywhere but up based on current market demands
Under valued share in the world be ready for big move may be $650 soon hold tight and go little longer
If we can get NVDA down $50 tomorrow at the open I will cover 1/4 of my short positions
JH coming on mad money tonight after the Bell. You think he would come on with lousy numbers? Hehe. Vamos! 
BUY NVIDIA !!!$1200-2000 IN 12-28 MONTHS.
update:Legend and his army are pulling ahead...come on longs.....you can do better.
Signed up to (http://Rightpicker.com) last month and instantly saw why my trading buddy has been banking so many winners. She tried to fly under the radar but the secret is out. Join them today.
"Since Kevin has a million shorted shares, I assume he's down $7 million today. May have to sell one of the yachts."
no panics! tomorrow's labor report may trigger a 700 points rally.
ARK Investment Cathie Woods loaded up around $520... $600 plus here we come !!! 
"Nvidia today announced at the GTC China Conference that its CloudXR platform will support the Tencent Cloud platform, allowing cloud users to stream XR content to remote VR and AR devices. $Tencent, $WIMI"
579 R.I.P. Bag  holders galore Greed is what kills Ask FSLY SQ QCOM AMD
The double talk Cathie Woods just spewed was incredible.
"Only good news for longs in ARK Cathie Woods probably the worst trader who ever lived unloaded NVDA today, BUT so did Jensen HUANG sold 24,000,000 dollars worth"
$524 is the highest NVDA will ever be ever again! Mark and save this post
Why is nvidia people not switching to tsmc now that they know who controls the chips
"BTW, as if anyone didn’t notice, it’s “LannyDaLegend” using my real name Lanny now, so I can receive the much deserved adulation from my fans."
YES $499 yesssss finally
NVDA # 1Buying every 3 monthswill be good for the year!!!
This is the new USA ?? where companies like GME about to go bankrupt rise 500% and stonks with huge earnings fall 30% in a week. Cancel culture anyone who isn?t a #$%$ This is what you all wanted. The second Mr Alzheimer?s was sworn in I sold and shorted everything
"Autonomous driving, AI, Gaming, Crypto Mining, cloud data centersNVDA has them all and is the best at them all."
"Gaming gpu's , all sold out and EV/AI sales are probably going through the roof with all the new contracts. MLNX adding to revenue and gains. Coiled spring because all of this is not priced in. And neither is the ARM take over. When that happens it will be ""nvidia inside"" for 75% of everything I guess."
So the 600 calls won’t be worthless on Friday? I’m thinking the options book kid needs to turn it upside down or something.
"Hi 610, next step is 700 after earnings report! ALSO Kevintheloser cant be found!! Hes missing!!"
"Potential for 1000, 2000 SP one day?"
I think scalpers have made more off this company in the last 2 earnings cycles than the shareholders. I still cant buy a card since Septembers release. I'd buy any 30 series if I could. If that doesn't boost earnings I don't know what would.
"NASDAQ up 500 from the lows, and NVDA still down $10; this may honestly be the worst stock I have ever seen in my life, hands down"
u would think that this company didnt beat bottom and top and issue strong guidance in a chip short industry smh is this a joke really how does gamestop go up 40 percent and nvda makes 5 billion a qt let me say that again 5 billion
"I am in at 261 per share, great long term core holding, will be a lot higher going forward."
NVDA is the future that will help the future become a better future :DYou understand?
Going 450! Will buy 4 more there.
"This could be 100pts higher in 2 months, companies like intel/amd start reporting in a good month, time flies."
"KevinTheLoser, today must be a very sad day for you. Losing both Nvidia and Fastly shorts. More to come. Bet your broker is looking for you now."
"NVDA came back and tested (breakout) resistance, now support, should continue its journey higher now."
Lookin' good on a very bad market day.
You all now realize what you own. Right? A house  of cards in a wind storm! I can’t believe anyone is long this stock here into earnings!
How low will Nvidia go. Anyone know.
Longs who think NVDA is going higher after great earnings: Check out TTD tonight absolutely crushed earnings by a “mile” upped guidance and down $30
"Hey folks, back from my IKON Colorado Tour. Heard I was missed."
I like it - up 8% & ~ 15% above Average Daily Volume ALREADY! Bullish signs for sure !
Anyone ever wonder who the people are that sell in ah after a quarter like that.
Rejected at her 200 day MA $485Shorting large
"NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) had its price target increased by Needham & Company LLC from $700.00 to $800.00 in a report published on Wednesday, Benzinga reports. Needham & Company LLC currently has a buy rating on the computer hardware maker’s stock."
Making so much money trading NVDA should be illegal. Just kidding. $6k so far this week.
Didn't put in my buy order last Monday morning. Glad I didn't. But I DEFINITELY will at some point. Stock has fallen much more than I would have expected after that BLOW OUT earnings report AND company expectations for great future growth. Will take the plunge soon for long term holding.
Lots of Robinhoodlums and Reddit traders moved in NVDA. They will sell at the first sign of downturn. Watch out.
Watch for 550-570 by Friday. I see 524 before earnings.
Only has to rise 12% for longs to break even from yesterday lol 
What a ride!
NVDA fell $20 from it’s pre market highs $575 to $555. Good  luck to all longs. This is the end of NVDA forever.
"Shorts we have $400 in bag, stay short"
Will buy if it dips below 500 $
"it's not just nvda. it's the market. high valuation companies, mostly, i think, are dropppppppppin."
Congrats patient longs! Our time finally comes :)
Buying 5 more at 460 another 5 at 400 and at 300 I'll buy 15 !
does NVDA make chips too?if so they will benefit with the shortage of chips right?GO NVDA # 1
Is this breakfast time at the HOME ?
Feel so bad for longs :( Closed out my puts today at a nice profit and covered my short position.

"Everyone expects this to raise after the report. It might also fall 50$ or do nothing. The other tech giants also did, nothing or fell ...."
Is this Nvidia or AMD??
I'm waiting for my electric toothbrush to have AI. It should know what to do without my help.
Will hit $504 gap tomorrow night in after hours. $550 right here is the best short ever in the history of the stock market. Trust me and sell and short here. NVDA is R.I.P. DOA.
Going lower. I did it. Single handed destroyed NVidia.

NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Write  it down and don’t ever forget it
"Et voilà. Added some at 513. Gaming, mining,AI,AD/EV,data centers, ...it's still booming."
Hint to longs: When you see 10x the amount of call options bought over the put options into earnings the stock is going A LOT lower
"i am buying more. and i already have ""way too much""."
Where are all the NVDA perma bulls in here today to tell me I have been right almost everyday since I appeared in here August 2020 (was long until then).
NVDA not even down 20 yet and longs are complaining; will be down $50 by the close minimum
What stocks would you buy to diversify without selling NVidia which is now 26% of my portfolio
LOL $497. So simple yet so easy once her 200 day MA breaks $450 by tomorrow and NO ONE is holding over a weekend
green!!!!
No one is buying NVDA into a crash  and a weekend with bad job numbers
550 by Friday.!!!
@Freedom Seems your missed! Perhaps stuck on the l-80 trying to get over Donner Summit. I’m sure you’ll make it to Squaw for some Afternoon Freashies.

Anyone here bullish on TSMC? NVDA is my only semiconductor position but TSMC seems to have the global supply all to themselves.
@ $615 I read minimum 100+ posts in here (I refer to them as Joe Public) that NVDA will be $650 before earnings and $700 after earnings! I have a question: Do you like $550 tomorrow?
"$575 finally, not sure why but I'll take it."
I said down $50 today yesterday Not a bad little call by me
"Valuations matter. Most over valued semi stock on the planet is NVDA. If you want exposure to Chips, buy AVGO, LRCX. You will sleep better and great dividends."
"nvidia, only green stock on my watchlist, ...impressive."
My perfect scenario: people are tired of the beating the nasdaq has taken in the last few days and everyone buys nvda tomorrow because of good ER :) that would be a dream come true
"nvda is one of the few chip stocks today that is greensmh underperforming market againas money broadens out into other sectorsfor the overall market, that is a very good thing a very healthy sign for the overall overmarket means the market has much more to go"

How’s that $700 price target looking by Susquehanna ahead of earnings? LOL 
This stock is great at disappointing following earnings.Management has no concern for shareholders. BUYBACK SHARES.

No question... $QCOM and $NVDA shareholders will take a close look at $NIO now... And realise it's a great opportunity to invest in too...
We were higher mid august and forward pe is just 33 while there was about 50% yoy growth. Madness. People aren't interested in future wealth anymore. Ponzi scheme like investments like GME with instant gratification on the other hand....
Just buy Boeing BA & Chevron CVX here no matter the price and short NVDA $516
From 610 to 463. What a drop! Maybe tie to add to my long position
"nvda up $14 today and $7 in AH. 100% solid gains. doesnt matter how much up it goes, it's up in the long term"

markets going to have immaculate recovery again today......fed ready to crush debt with more obscene debt
My question is why don’t people like Kevin learn from shorting NVDA and just go long? Why continue to lose constantly? He’s been on this board bashing since NVDA was $400. That was $214 ago.
genius genius genius !! believed in u since 64 this is only the beginning go nvda
"yeah, ok, i was startled for a millisecond: Qualcomm buying Bay Area chip startup Nuvia for $1.4 billion"

What happened here today?
diamond hands get rewarded
The only outstanding question is the exact date we hit $1000. I am open to all suggestions. For those of you that can’t see the fantástico drivers in front of this gem of a company. May I suggest taking up another pastime. Perhaps Birdwatching or Butterfly collecting. Certainly stamp collecting could be an outlet for your lack of stock investing prowess as would bowling. Hehe. 
The regular Hyena's here will be silenced as Nvidia goes green just around the time they all get in line at the Salvation Army soup kitchen for lunch. They are still mad that the SA doesn't deliver meals to their trailer park.
The confession of an imbecile: I should have bought more Nvidia stock. I bought my first 300 shares at $26.90/share. I added another 345 shares over time with an total average cost of about $145. I could have bought more but I didn't. Don't be an idiot like me. Today I placed my hand on hot stove burner for failing to add even more to my Nvidia position at much lower prices. I'm so ashamed I can even leave the house. Just keep adding shares.
NVDA is not more than 336 at all. Funds will get out like BABA.
You all realize we’re going to $700 eh? Ok just checking 
"NVDA only down $10 off it’s highs, going back below $520. By Friday. Trade accordingly."
Bought more shares.

"What a week. Finally unloaded the calls that were threatening my whole position for 5 months at just above breakeven. Was able to keep the gains since 17 and keep my shares. Great stock but scary options, for me anyway. Could have done better if Id have waited but was sick of the 1 day spikes."
Let's be honest with ourselves here. Nvidia stock has NO TOP !!!

My source at Morgan Stanley says 10 year will be under 1.50 later today and 1.45 by Friday. NVDA will be over $525.
I guess China (geezer) Joey is adding to the fuel upward for this great company.
"NVDA going x div tomorrow, make sure to buy at close to capture the dividend."
Cant wait for the commie CEO to mislead investors AGAIN at earnings.
"SOXX, which is the semiconductor index in which NVDA is a big part of, was up 33% since July, NVDA down 15%. Seriously longs, AAPL earned $112b in a quarter and fell from $145 to $129. You think NVDA which has a serious  supply constraint issue, is going to rally after earnings?"
This market runs to the next shiny object.

"For the bears and short sellers here in this page - you can keep shorting this stock, and in fact its is very healthy for this stock to down trend for a while after the amazing run they had in the past years!

They continuously innovate and bring state-of-the-art AI models and practices!! take a look at their recent model which generates HIGH RESOLUTION human images - https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ - This is truly MIND BLOWING !!!!And if you don't get the true connection between AI and NVIDIA you can go and check my latest videohttps://youtu.be/7ZiZE7GmJ7w promise you that after you get the business model of this company and its real future - you will pull your short positions!"

ONLY down $11! That’s the best reaction NVDA has ever had after earnings
"Was considering buying more as soon as it broke below 500. I'll wait until next week to see if these head fakes stop, and begin showing a a true up trend. Won't even mind buying at 500, just need some evidence it's done downtrending."
"NVDA to $550 in March, $600 + in April. Watch and learn!"
Arriba NVDA!

"btw: eps in may expected 2020: 1.69 (they beat), share price was 355 eps in may expected 2021: 3.20 (that's almost +90%) share price converted +90%=680 and we're not even talking ARM here, can you say undervalued?"
"The NASDAQ could rise to 100,000 and NVDA is never ever going up ever again. Sell $509 here"
"Best $20 stock I have ever picked! I believe that this will reach &1,000 by this time next year!"
OK fess up  rookies who bought $557+? NVDA great  trading stock way beyond the top of her range. R.I.P. 
"INTC posts record revenue and is down 5% and they had no shortages of products, just imagine the drop in NVDA upon earnings due to supply constraints. I will say down $200."
YUP. earnings will be great
NVDA up a penny pre market I would short it here 0% chance it ever goes up ever
$515 today? I think not! I think  NEVER! Path of least resistance is much lower
Intel Xe is a brand new chiplet design. Nvidia's graphics is a monolithic dinosaur. Game over.
"Loved  when NVDA earnings came out at $580 traded to $602 in after hours, because no one really read just how bad their earnings were"
Next support level for NVDA is around $450 in coming sessions. No new upgrade is coming from the analysts except yahoo sponsored articles which incite the retail investors to buy every day.
"I am going to call NVDA earnings “the Qualcomm effect”. Was trading all time highs $167+, supply constraints, BAM $140! And CEO said, “we sold everything we made, but we just weren’t able to make enough due to supply constraints.”"
COME ON AND RIDE IT THE NVIDIA CHOO CHOO TRAIN!!!
"When you see the average shareholder of a stock, in this case NVDA, has an IQ below 50, you know the stock will crash"
Will be a good er. The question is will Nvidia fall like so many other semi stocks on a good er? Perhaps that era is now behind us and stocis go up on a good er...again.
NVDA will fall to $460 after earnings guaranteed supply constrained once again like every awful quarter
4 more market days before ER....I say 625 to 630 BEFORE wednesday night. That's only +6% or so.
Short from 468 to 614 I come in here for 7 months at 589 1000x a day begging you to sell and short NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite

"As disability awards grow, so do concerns over the veracity of veterans’ PTSD claimsBy Alan ZaremboOctober 16, 2014The 49-year-old veteran explained that he suffered from paranoia in crowds, nightmares and unrelenting flashbacks from the Iraq war. He said he needed his handgun to feel secure and was worried that he would shoot somebody.The symptoms were textbook post-traumatic stress disorder.But Robert Moering, the psychologist conducting the disability examination at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Tampa, Fla., suspected the veteran was exaggerating. Hardly anybody had so many symptoms of PTSD so much of the time.As disability awards for PTSD have grown nearly fivefold over the past 13 years, so have concerns that many veterans might be exaggerating or lying to win benefits. Moering, a former Marine, estimates that roughly half of the veterans he evaluates for the disorder exaggerate or fabricate symptoms.Depending on severity, veterans with PTSD can receive up to $3,000 a month tax-free, making the disorder the biggest contributor to the growth of a disability system in which payments have more than doubled to $49 billion since 2002.“It’s an open secret that a large chunk of patients are flat-out malingering,” said Christopher Frueh, a University of Hawaii psychologist who spent 15 years treating PTSD in the VA system.Diagnosing PTSD can be difficult in the best of circumstances. Experts have long debated how to define the condition. One person can suffer crippling anxiety from an experience that would not faze someone else.Assessing PTSD becomes even more difficult in a VA system that gives veterans a financial incentive to appear as sick as possible, former and current VA mental health clinicians said. The number of veterans on the disability rolls for the disorder has climbed from 133,745 to more than 656,000 over the last 13 years."
"Not to worry if in for long as short moment those weak hands could do wildly things causing market turmoil...but overall it should be up and up...no doubt about that since tons of upgrades before and even today higher $800 target, that's amazing and good point for NVDA stock long holders...."

The analyst notes that the fundamental backdrop for the company is ""particularly strong"", and while his estimates for Q4 are in line with consensus, he sees Q1 estimates by the Street as being ""low"". Srivastava adds that Nvidia's gaming business is particularly strong, with crypto mining adding to the demand, and the company is being ""more proactive"" than the last time in addressing the crypto surge."

"ensen HuangThanks for joining us today. Q4 have the truly breakout year for Nvidia. The two biggest engines of our business gaming and data center posted powerful growth. Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry, and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve with the countless metaverses.So I'm for placed on for work. Gaming at simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Crowd computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips on servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now.With our expertise in AI computing full stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud to edge platforms, Nvidia is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy efficient CPU company will help position and video to lead in the age of AI. This year was extraordinary.The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics. This underlies the accelerated adoption of Nvidia’s technology. The urgency to digitize, automate and accelerate innovation has never been higher. We are ready. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks a lot."
"As predicted, this stock DID NOT close above 600 share price and the 600 Calls are worthless. So I predicted weeks ago. And let’s be honest, options control the share price."
Right now the 10 year is all about the big banks and protecting their huge exposure to very interest rate sensitive derivatives. We are talking about trillions and trillions of exposure. The most agregious is of course our friend JP Morgan and ruler of the universe Jamie Diamond

Look  @ the NVDA chart rookies it’s right back to where it was last July and we all know it went to 468

NVDA will be $299 before $500Anyone want to bet?
Will have the “Apple effect” at earnings. Have outstanding numbers then get crushed AH and the next day.
Simple: BUY PUT options expiring Friday $50 under the near close at 3:50pm EST today and retire for life.
This is the beginning of the fall to $504 by Wednesday. Good luck to all traders. Buy XOM
Is Nvidia's run over. Its back to being a gaming company. So it should be $100 stock.
"Saw Dan Niles on fast money, a must watch, a former SEMI analyst, there are only pockets where there is shortage but overall world is flooded with chips. Not sure what will happen with all added capacity."
"Cramer today...""So, let me go over my impressions of Twitter (TWTR) , Salesforce (CRM) , Fisker (FSR) , Nvidia (NVDA) , and Airbnb (ABNB) , surely the biggest guest list if only because we have never has more than three guests at once.First, let's go over the two the market got wrong. Let's start with Jensen Huang and Nvidia. The quarter just reported was superb, as usual, but the conference call brought out lingering fears of 2018, where Nvidia ended up with some slowing end markets, crypto and data center. The latter soon accelerated, but because of an oddity of not knowing whether its cards were being used in gaming or mining, the company saw an inventory glut when bitcoin crashed.This time around the data center spend is accelerating, because of the move to the cloud, and the company has a real hand on crypto, which could be a good business and Nvidia will have its own Ethereum mining chips that can be monitored. The market was wrong on both counts. Can Nvidia close on the Arm Holdings deal giving it the best full suite of chips for every fast growing market? After doubting Jensen on the ability to close on Mellanox, I am not going to make the same mistake this time around. This stock is way too cheap versus next year's numbers-not this year's-and it's a buy."""
No one in this room is selling. Am I rite!?!?

$492 is the forever high ever in NVDASave this brilliance
Should have bought more SQ too at $191.
this is going to turn green by close
NVDA could easily fall $100 today. Already down $75 from last week!
$515 to $557 and you are shocked it’s going back to $515? Doesn’t anyone know how to read a chart? Shorting isn’t hard folks. Just hit short instead of buy.
Anyone know Darth Trader & Kevin one and the same ?
Dow all time highs up 500NVDA down $120
I Repeat strong sell on this. No kidding..it's going to fall badly.
"Once REDDIT Wall Street Bets/RobinHood takes over your stock like I knew they did in NVDA last week, it’s automatically going to crash"

"Saturday afternoon thoughts on NVDA: (1) QCUM AMD INTC all down 15% after earnings due to supply constraints (2) NVDA down 589 to 540 while the NASDAQ has risen 5000 points (3) NVDA 589 to 540 while the semiconductor index SOXX has risen 27%(4) Please listen to me, sell NVDA short, buy puts and sell 540 stock, for down 15-20% is $100+ downside"
375 by next Monday
Anyone buy $602 last night after earnings or $550 now!
Down $25 and closed at the low.
Why are so much sell off in the market?
what a breakout. patience pays
Zacks expects $13.27 earnings per share - wow The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 14.2% in the past 30 days to $13.27 per share. The figure indicates growth of 32.7% on a year-over-year basis.
I'm in favor of a split. Reduce the SP and bring in additional investors. NVDA has plenty of room to run as the economy recovers.
I called 800 by July a year ago. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN!
"I can't understand the concerns by some on this board. NVDA is historically volatile, and often going the wrong direction soon after earnings. But no doubt it will shortly break out of the 600 threshold again, to quickly annihilate the recent 614.90 high. Also, a PE of 90 something is nothing for a company with enormous growth potential. If the news of ARM acquisition completion drops, then seatbelt needed from there on. It will be rollercoaster but to higher heights at each break out."
"@Kalpesh....we need a victory dance, please."
The great Nasdaq crash of 2021 thru 2023 has just begun. Nvidia is in fact being tossed out with the Nasdaq bath water. Nostradamus predicted the end of Nasdaq and semiconductor sector in 2021. Do what is right and sell your shares so we can make the prophesy self fulfilling.
"Don't fight the tape. Nasdaq Composite down below 13,000, first time since January! A whole month up, all gone away. l expect some bounce Friday, but still a negative day IMO."
$513 inner loin short going to $463 I won’t cover a penny before
NVDA $460 tomorrow night after bad leaked earnings
NVDA down $20 and falling; will be $460 tomorrow! 615 to 550 I am begging you sell now buy it back 100 lower

"$SOXX +3.5% today. Yep, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. $AMD $NVDA"
Anyone see GME $172 today LOL  so simple yet so easy now going to $500 for sure this week save this brilliance NVDA $463 by Friday
NVDA 615 last weekNVDA 602 after earnings NVDA 557 two days agoNVDA 541 yesterday am NVDA 512 now going to 489
I've told you under $500 by the weekend
Shorts enjoy your success. Not gonna last long.
The mighty NVIDIA up again today.
Wait until the Kia Hyundai/apple news gets absorbed. That alone takes us over 650. The routine of Europe/UK investigating rhe arm takeover was programmed to begin with.
"TK12, how many times a day do you calculate what your shares would have been worth if you weren’t such a pansy?"
Just shorted $580.17My 23rd position Cha Ching
Selloff #3. Hold that commie responsible!!!! Everyday this gets CRUSHED
This thing doesn’t move. Having any stake here is literally losing money. Good look anyone that’s holding. I’ll love this to into chip makers. Looking at you $NVDA
"with rising rates, sector rotation is underway and semi's got the back of the hand treatmentnvda will survive and thrive"
The amd fanbois never learn. They'd better be worried about amd's valuation in a shrinking x86 market and intel getting ready to strike back . And losing market share to nvidia as well. Nvidia has said it could take 18 months for the arm deal to be accomplished so another 12 months I guess. In the meanwhile nvidia's mgmt see it as a done deal as they're praising the collaboration on their website (AI possibilities etc).
How is NVDA still $539? Not even down $100 since last week. Makes no sense. A lot of “meat” left on this bone!!!
volume is picking up too
"MU is acting strong today too, if you are long"
I will go live at 02:00 PM Pacific Standard Time
I am begging  you to short NVDA $517 here. It’s not even close to the bottom. Trust me!!!
Definitely worth dollar cost averaging in at these levels if you are thinking long term.
"I am long NVDA, but I want to point out one thing that people seem to not understand about this company: they are not a ""Chipmaker"". They are a fabless semiconductor design house. This matters because they are held hostage to the same chip crunch that everyone is fighting right now. A chip shortage means NVDA cannot get enough chips to build their final products, and it also means paying higher prices to Samsung and TSMC who are the fabs that actually produce their chips. It also means they will have to commit to larger order sizes, and build more inventory in the future. These are certainly headwinds to this stock. I don't think this is concerning enough to sell, but certainly not good news."
"back up we go, up $10. Kylie and his boyfriend Darth tried to come and act like NVDA is going to red "
Thanks to both Kevin Sir and Freedom Sir! They each know who they are more than they let on !!! :-)
Perma bulls are weird 615 to 480 and every dollar they scream buy here/are you all using Monopoly money or are you all trust fund kids?
Get ready for LIFT OFF After hours. This stock will have BLOW OUT earnings.
I warned you guys. I am in and my inverse Midas touch takes place. When I held Intel it went down every day. I hold 5 share's so not to much to lose. Guess what? I'll not sell till we reach 10$ roflol. I have warned you because I play fair!
10 year treasuries varied between 4% to 14% from 1964 and 2007. The economy and the stock market for most part did fine. Then the FED went nuts and now 1.5% is horrible? Eliminate the FED!
Lol. These markets are a total joke.
Anyone else here been selling the NVDA 600 call options every week for the past 7 months and banking 100% per month? Or no?

"This stock will double by first quarter 2022. I love this stock. It is recommended by Monthly Fool and many other brokers that know what they are talking about. Chip sector will be super hot with record earnings this year. And, next year even better. What are you going to buy GME???? lol"
NVDA Sideways CHART for 5 months has got me worried
"Analyst out saying, “NVDA looks pricey into earnings.” Gee, really? Where was he at $615 when I was shorting?"
"$NVDA $GOOG $WIMI check out the bid and ask. Nobody really wants to sell, shorts getting forced to cover. Nowhere to go but up "
So many pumpers dreams shattered last night - how may bought AH at $600?????
Buy buy buy buy
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH MY BUDDY THAT WORKS AT NVIDIA. HE SAYS THE COMPANY IS FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS. BUY NVIDIA!
$480!!!!!!! YES!!!!!! Anyone remember $502?????
The NASDAQ was down 450 points and people are concerned lol
Maybe I need to forget the market and just buy a bakery that makes weddings cakes for transgender couples? Obviously the rules have changed.
AH and the following day after earnings you can expect 4-7% decline due to a shortage of materials and the unsure status of the completion of the ARM'S deal.This is still a good company
Today doesn’t count zero volume R.I.P.  DOA  NVDA
I can see nvidia up 5% today. gonna be funds who weren't in buying now
We all know this will give back what it gave yesterday 
"NVDA slid with the market, nothing more to read here. Earnings were great, not spectacular, but still great. The stock will continue on the upward trajectory in the coming months."
Guess Kevin just hang himself. He claimed 350$....
when i see chronics falling all over themselves squealing the market and the world is coming to endbuy with both fistsFUD spewing chronics AWAYS crown the lows
rock on
Let’s get loud fellow Longs! This is a major breakout this week with ambitions to once again double this year 
"You're buying best of breed here, the penultimate chip maker on the planet...you're not investing for tomorrow or next month....you're investing for the future, a year, 3, 5 yrs out......folks are reminding us NVDA dropped 50% last yr, but that was in the midst of a demand collapse of everything but food....NVDA will make new highs again.....margin money is coming out of the mkt today....real investors are here to stay...."
NVDA was $481.99 and I said it would trade $299 before $482. So simple yet so easy
Please remember today near the close to panic out of Nvidia in an orderly manner. Thank you.
"You amateurs like NVDA $589 last July or $499 now in March of 2020, 8 months later? ROTFLMFAO "
"This is just incredible, this company is just growing exponentially:“Moving to Data Center. Revenue was $1.9 billion which exceeded our expectations, was comparable to last quarter, and up 97% from the year ago period, which did not include Mellanox. Data Center compute revenue was up 45% year-on-year. Full-year Data Center revenue rose 125% to a record $6.7 billion, including almost 70% growth from data center computer. From a sequential perspective, the Data Center compute's stronger than expected double-digit growth more than offset the anticipated decline in Mellanox revenue, which included a large non-recurring network sale to a single OEM in Q3.”"
NVDA the # 1 !!!!don't be afraid just invest!
only reason I am not buying NVDIA is because I Got in at 160. if you are not long at this prices you don't like free money.
Patience and let your winners run. The road to success.
The pattrn on NVDA per Cramer is it goes down for a couple of days on great earnings because most people cannot understand what is being told them. You gotta be an advanced technical engineer.
Should be in the 300s by Friday and 200s by the end of next week.
Stonks are going A LOT lower. We are in inning one. Thank the democrats who are worried about men playing women’s sports and using the woman’s room
"And then, gonna try and use NVDA/tech to prop it up. Thus the staggered approach. Then the bottom drops to 250."
"615 to 460 since last week 6,500 shares $155 x 6,500 shares Skiing  or fishing ?1,010,000 loss just in NVDA this week Free-DUMB it’s going to $299"
Holding 22 units of NVDA Has been stagnant for a whileBut it’s gem and will touch $600 in 2 months
"I bet we will be up regardless of what the nasdaq does, tomorrow. Keep the faith, longs. Nvidia is the future of many things."
Major buy orders coming at 2.30 pm. My sell order of $525 will be filled. watch and learn. Kevin's pantiiiies are going up to his/her shoulders.
"@LarryTheLegend no wonder no one listen to you. according to you, NVDA will fall like it did last March. do you have any idea what happened in last March or do you need a lesson for that?"
RED WOW
Just like clockwork!!!!
"@Kyle if I were you, I wouldn't be talking, how's your prediction for today going? exactly"
"yeah. not new news: When NVIDIA launched the GTX 1050 Ti in October of 2016, Obama was still president and Samsung’s fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 was the biggest tech news. Now it seems that this relatively ancient GPU is coming back due to an acute shortage of GPUs, PC World has reported.NVIDIA confirmed that it was “meeting market demand which remains extremely high,” by re-releasing older GPUs including the RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti to its board partners. ..The GTX 1050 Ti launched at just $139 but is currently selling for well above that (i just checked. cheapest price on amazon is 261). Meanwhile, the RTX 2060 launched on the market in early 2019 for $350, but can be found on NewEgg from $800 to $1,644, not exactly an affordable price point for most gamers.New NVIDIA 3000-series GPUs are all but impossible to find, simply because NVIDIA can’t get enough GPUs to keep up with demand."
It’s a beat!!!!!!
"Darth Trader at post #15,450! Still the record holder and employee of the year!"
Anyone remember $615 two weeks ago along with 16 upgrades to over $800 LOL 
What are the chances that the ARM deal will go through? I am optimistic and think it will go through. The only reason I feel that way is the Mellanox deal was approved and that wasn’t too long ago. With the process being fresh and the players are basically the same after a lot of noise from the competition it will be approved but only with enormous promises to England that it will still be a major part of their economy with a new facility and the retention of a majority of the people already in place. How are the other longs feeling about this EPIC deal that will make us a boatload of $$$$?
Sell the weekly 600 calls all day long and make 100% once again
I love  when the CEO says how great things are BUT sells $1b in stock $100 higher than where the stock is now
Recent history says great ER leads to selloff - just look at Aapl - msft - pton - etc ...
"Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley, I admire him, is expecting a 10% correction in February-March time frame. Be careful trading."
Nvidia's data center sales probably slowed down because of Intel's much better Xe SG1 for dedicated Server streaming. Costs much less.
"did you know that 80% of the homeless nowadays collect govt disability checks every month?ssi/ssdi did you know 80% of the homeless have severe drug/alcohol addictions?we and the govt policies are now enabling severe drug/alcohol addicts to further their downward spiralwhen you talk to veteran street and drug counselors, the number one recommendation for any addict is to cut the money off govt disability rolls have created far more harm than good"
NVDA is $582 right now Just read 50 more posts that it’s going to 700-1000Just watch her drop now
Darth Trader and Legend trying to make people short the stock. Do something more productive. We re holding long. You can go on with your day.
This is a great short today. It looks like 540 is in the cards for today. Massively overvalued here.
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL NEW SHAREHOLDERS! I BOUGHT THE OTHER DAY AT $539. I AM GOING TO PUT IN A LOW BALL LIMIT OFFER TOMORROW. I LOVE DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN IT IS THE BEST INVESTING STRATEGY THERE IS. BUY GREAT STOCKS DURING MARKET SELL OFFS.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
ARK Funds bought in a lot of shares recently... I would trust Jensen to lead us to $700 soon. My opinions only. Best.
"Kalpesh (rookie novice) 615 to 583 since mall call, and you are asking me about down $50 in one day? It’s down $32 in two days! Did you sell the 600 weekly calls for $20 on Monday? $0 now"
"If NVDA plows through Kevin's hard ceiling at 540, his kids may need to go back to public school and eat in the cafeteria."
Why own big tech anymore? They all smash earnings and sell off. And people wonder why people are buying gme.
"bitcoin is an abominationto produce one btc takes the equivalent energy of an months usage from an average householdbtc doesn't add anything to global economyall it does is consume great gobs of energy to further its calculations that aren't applied to anything other to make more btc and i hope a movement takes hold that asks nvda to stop supplying crypto miners, especially btc"
"Just a temporary dip, no big deal. This is a strong growth stock."
"Very good buying opportunity for the long-term.Trust NVDA and you will be rewarded. Long since 2017, seen the very worst (crash of Nov 2018). The best is yet to come.."
We should hit $504 today. Please trade accordingly.
Intriguing... As long as they hold an edge on competition.
Nvidia is holding up with good support at $501. It will not go down that fast shorties
Buy and hold!
anyone see under $400 tomorrow? I do too! Good luck to all who listened to me for the last 7 months 1000 posts per day begging you to short
NVDA newest quote: “Down 40 dollars a day keeps the doctor away.”
"NVDA is like Cramer's Bear Stearns and Lehman, buy, buy, buy calls."
The beauty of this $200 fall is there was only one downward gap with earnings and it really wasn’t big @ $580 got to $574 and traded $602 in after hours so I am not sure if that was even a gap
NVDA went from $300+ last March to $180 or so this March $615 to $299 without an uptick
I was able to feast on discounted Nvidia and $AMD shares this morning. This is what gets me up in the morning which is opportunities to buy undervalued semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies at favorable prices.
Buy any weakness. Nvidia going to double. They literally cannot keep up with demand. Nvidia chips are in everything.
It must be because data center has slowed a lot. Intel is probably doing it to Nvidia with its Streaming Xe-SG1 server cards.
Bye bye $600’s foreverAll 600 call options since August $0#FACTS NVDA was $589+ in AugustIt’s $598 now NASDAQ up 5000 points during this time
$600+ stock $10 from NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!ROCKET TIME
"KevintheLoooooooooser is SalamanderJohnson now. $590 looks good to me, called it 3 hours ago."
Up 1.6 %......BIG DEAL
The ARM deal is issue. NVDA going down. Not a buy at all.
earnings come out at 5pm EST. that’s another 40 minutes away. be patient..
"My youngest daughter asked me what i do for a living since we are @ The Breakers for nearly a month $2500 a night, I told her, “short Nvidia.”"
either we see $560 tomorrow or $590. that's whats going to happen. market is unpredictable at this point
I cashed out 20% of NVDA and rolled it into CCIV / lucid. They are using the Nvidia drive chips.
Nvda still a buy at all time high
Google and Microsoft joining QCOM in blocking ARM deal. Oh no !
GREAT DAY TO BE ADDING SHARES WITH THE OVERALL MARKETS DOWN.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE INALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN.
The double top ( monthly) was obvious. Good company but even at 250$ it would be valued very rich. So 3 times tripple top with different ascending patterns at 596 and now 550. This will go lower
Did you all really think  NVDA was going to trade higher two days in a row? Hasn’t done that feat in well over a year #FACTS
Creepy Joe says buy NVDA if you want a stimulus check...
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Longs: the stock has to rally $50 after earnings LOL to break even from yesterday think about that
This stock since July has been nothing but an ATM for insiders. How do you get rich in the stock market? By selling
$615 to $548 in a week Told you bad earnings were leaked So simple yet so easy
200 day moving averages is breached going to $299 next week
This lead brick  balloon is going under $300. Chip shortage is now a glut. Heard it here first. When that news hits NVDA will fall $200 overnightv
I plan on selling one third of my NVDA at 648 in after hours because I bought so many during the sell offearly yesterday.
"As a long-time NVDA holder, I am shocked that it is red today. Nasdaq is flying and pretty much everything is green but NVDA is red? As far as I know, everything in the last qtr earnings looked great. So, what is holding this stock down? All I can think of is that there is some institution that is either unloading a ton of their NVDA holdings or they are shorting the heck out of this stock right now. Either way, I'm assuming it's just a short-term thing and hope it starts moving higher soon."
no way this opens down $20 after this recent quarter...big boys trying to pick up cheap shares after hours
Sheesh down $100 in 11 days.
Zero volume rally totally meaningless Will give it all back tomorrow on double the volume Volume never lies ever
Can't wait for the non believers to cash out.
$567 is the most beautiful  double top formation I ever saw
TIME FOR THE NVIDIA ROCKET TO TAKE OFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!!!!$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!
I sold my shares 2 weeks ago to Cathie Wood at $555. Who is smart now ?
$615 - $550 = longs R.I.P.  DOA 
NVIDIA is up 4.91% to 570.35
$605 to $573 is “only” a $32 intraday crash  which is only in the 1st inning of the sell off!
540 end of week
LOL I AN HAVING A GREAT TIME HERE AT LAKE TAHOE!!!! JUST GOT DONE CROSS COUNTRY SKIING! GREAT EXERCISE! I SPEND AT LEAST 190 DAYS HERE FOR TAX PURPOSES TO ESTABLISH RESIDENCE SO I DON’T GET TAXED IN SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA. SO GREAT TO BE TAX SMART AND INVESTMENT SMART. BUY NVIDIA AND HOLD AS LONG AS YOU CAN!
NVDA down 5% is it’s best day in a month
"Also from Motley Fool:Not surprisingly, the demand for the A100 GPUs was reportedly exceeding supply last year. A ramp-up in production bodes well for NVIDIA's data center revenue, which accounted for 40% of its revenue in the fiscal third quarter and recorded a massive year-over-year jump of 162%.-----Bears call the stock trash and wonder why it goes up so much. 162% increase is not trash. Demand in data centers will only increase in the coming years, and that's just one area they are involved in. Do some research."
graceful exit yesterday at 521 on expiring calls
Blow out earnings from Nvidia. They are selling all they can make. Assume your positions.
"I’ve been abusing the stock FSLY just like I do in here, began shorting at $80 all the way to $120, the whole time they all laughed at me, take a little looksie now, they are calling me a genius. Same exact thing will happen here. I don’t randomly short, I pick stocks where everyone is bullish."
Less than 1% away from the all-time closing high of $582.48. Half an hour remaining ... hmmm.
"I have been saying it for weeks now, if you own any stock ARK does you are R.I.P.  She will soon lose 50% and fast plus redemptions and outflows her fund will be Chapter 11 by April"
selling here makes little sense to me...i shall hold
NVDA weekly 550 call options are down 85% today and there were HUGE amounts bought
Anyone remember $519 here? LOL Now the round 2 of pain begins FreeDUMB bragging ???
"If you didn't get in at $600 when all the analysts were calling for $700 and $800, now is the time."
"Urging patience here. Lack of clarity on the outcome of the ARM deal and supply chain issues will drive this stock slightly down or at least keep it sideways for the foreseeable future. Even though the last earnings beat EPS forecast by 25% the stock has been trading sideways, up only $9 from the last ER. We saw a run up to $582 then mass sell off down to $510 before stabilizing after ER around $535. That was with expected and delivered GOOD news. This time we're expecting bad news, like the continued supply chain woes, or any failure to blow EPS out of the water will drive this much lower than $510. Plan to purchase more around the $480-$500. Just consider it a late Christmas present."
Just announced. NVDA will be on CNBC tonight. They'll be talking about their Blowout quarter. Good Luck
NVIDIA TO $750+ BY NEXT EARNINGS.
"It goes up because new short positions been sold, you have to buy before sell!!"
"So I’m 23. I went all in on call options. $36,000 in total contracts. Not sure how much I just made but I know it’s a lot"
"Watch my AVGO next week after earnings. Cheap valuation compared to NVDA, will make 52 week high. Buy now."
all gain of the week wiped out during 1 night  ..... redicolous
Unbelievable

"The Chinese EV’s are going with NVDA chips. That is a humongous market. We are just scratching the surface of how high we can go. Add to that Gaming, Data Centers, Crypto Mining, AND the #1 Artificial Intelligence Company and yes a $1000+ stock....... eezy peezy. "

One hair out of place in earning We tank for the third time in a row
"Makes sense, now time to short, we are going back to normal, demand for PC will drop, since people will start travelling again.That's why the drop in NVDA post reporting."
"Normal reaction to beating by 10% and raising Guidance by over 10% would be a nice run up. Not this time. I can't tell if NVDA is getting caught up in the tech sell off, or if its just overbought, or if its sell on the news. The overall reaction was to raise guidance. Seems like the average is about 625-650 A few 500's & A few 700's but to drop 25+ after this Q seems odd."
"  PLEASE READ THESE #FACTS: Guys like FreeDUMB constantly point out NVDA was $180 or so last March, well it was $300+ before it fell during the fake Covid scare, so basically it went from $300 to $532 as of this morning. Not even up 100%. I own a stock named Penn National Gaming, it was $3 in March, not one of these BS Reddit stocks, it went to $130. That is an increase of 4000% since the Covid lows. NVDA is a massive underperformer no matter how you slice it. I can name 5000 stocks that are up twice as much as NVDA"
Long and strong. Forecast now even higher....
$700 by next ER.
NVDA weekly 550 calls down 70% today. Did anyone see the volume on those the past two days? Tens of millions worth all used toilet paper 
Kids were betting with me. It's heading to 472 support and then 336.
"I don't understand the concerns regarding the chip shortage as this will be gone in no time. Of course, this affects the SP temporarily, but it is limited to some weeks or at maximum for 3-6 months. But what happens when that shortage is over; in the meanwhile price per unit go up as well due to higher demand, therefore revenue should stay almost the same. This means NVDA should not face a huge loss or cut its forecast for the long term. It's like people think the factories burned down."
Breakout at 520 and we're off to the races.
Yesssss WHAT TIME RED? Lol felt it at 535 in my inner loins going back to 463
way overdone!
Another Fantastic Day amigos 
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!ROFLOL!!!YOU CAN'T BLAME ME IF YOU DIDN'T GET IN. I HAVE BEEN SAYING DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN SINCE 2016 WHEN IT WAS $25.CHOO CHOO!
"Welcome  all from the gorgeous Breakers Hotel  my tan is unreal while all of you longs sit in your parents brown paneled wall basements from the 1970’s, as i vacation on your “dime”. Thank you "
Now the profit takers cash out....
How is that upgrade with a $700 price target  treating you all???
NVDA shareholders are the worst: They are actually “bragging” & “cheering” that the stock is now “only” down $12. Do you all reside in a trailer park in Florida?
NVIDIA is down 5.46% to 471.26
too bad im running out of cash to buy more nvda
"LOL  I wanted to “test” out Yahoo cancel culture leftist weak algorithms so I posted a fun blog about our new chief in charge, POOF, erased, cancelled"
NVDA short $536 is my #1 short ever in 30 years
"So I'm a gazillionaire, and I'm thinking hey I buy 10K shares of Nvidia for 5.5M. And if I got today's low, at 545, maybe I was sitting on 50K profit. And then I'm thinking how much do I think this will really go up even with earnings, it's all priced in. Maybe it goes to 650? It's not worth 1K for a gamer card stock. Even making $100 on my shares is small compared to other higher gain and I have to risk it's going the other way. I'd Sell."
I repeat 472 is around the corner. It's going to fall big time.
Nvidia has gone back to its roots as a gaming company. Doesn't deserve this high valuations as a gaming company. Maybe $100 stock.
been saying that for a while now: tsla is a bubble that will weigh severely on the nasdaq during bad market days. Hopefully we see some recovery end of day or tomorrow. Nvidia is still on its way to report their best quarter ever imo tomorrow after the bell.
Saying anything against the new us administration gets censored
here we goooooo...
Just might see $550 at the open
Rare opportunity to buy THE chipmaker of the future at a discount. ..with both hands today.
"pull back completely normal, off the races next week"
stock is being priced like the ARM deal is going to get squashed.
NVDA $615 will be written about in history books  when the stock is at $0.
You regulars are still here!? Interesting.
gonna be below $500 this weekend
"Selling today at $573, that's gonna hurt...."
WOW ITS UNDER $500 NOW ISNT THIS A BUY NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION? I HAD THIS PRICE POINT OF ANYTHING AROUND $500 AND IT WAS A BUY LAST YEAR SHOULDNT THIS BE A BUY EVEN NOW???
"Well; account back to end of Nov value.....actually, still up +50K considering that's what I took out to buy a 4 Runner TRD Pro. But the way gas is going up in price (thanks Sleepy Joe); I'll need to find a good camping site in the back country to hide from the wife until NVDA rights itself. 650 in 5 months; hopefully they get smart and split it when it's back to 600 to at least make it ""appear"" a more appealing buy."
"Look intently at this picture NVDA $614.24 vs Undervalued AMD $92.03, do your own homework and win."
Anyone here going to give me any credit here at $504? How long have I guaranteed it? Now $488
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!DON'T BE LEFT BEHIND.NVIDIA $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!
"Have $1,300,000 in buying power freed up, shorting 1500 more NVDA here $525, and buying $20,000 per week in put options for the next 2 months"
buy recommendations are flooding in
All I ever care about and dream about since July is $504 gap
500 next stop folks
"I'd just like to thank EVERY Quick Draw McShortWIT(Kevin) out there for putting the most Dynamic, Future Tech Integral Company ""ON SALE"" tomorrow... following a spectacular quarter....Seeing them cut their P/E in HALF A Sincere THANKS!!!!"
"Great results, muted response. Long term up though"
Hey jagoffs. Bet those $800 upgrades feel real good in your backsides BWAHAHAHA
I think tomorrow will open 560 and goes to 570
"$NVDA supplied ... this .. ""memory chip in the media control unit (MCU)"" that has a recall ... time for $TSLA to switch to $AMD.But drivers of affected cars, Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 and Model X SUVs from 2016 to 2018, have now started receiving emails about what to do next.The problem involved the memory chip in the media control unit (MCU), which could affect a range of safety issues including:-the loss of rear-view camera images and controls for heating, air conditioning and defrosting-the potential loss of audible chimes and alerts associated with indicators and the drive-assistance Autopilot feature"
Any one know why JenSen Huang doesn’t do CES 2021 video?
"Quadruple witch is staring at NVDA, on to $525 in the next 2 hours."
NVDA owns the following chipsAIGamesCryptoelectric carsTV chipsdeveloping cloud storagefingers in the correct pies....for continued growth
WHERE ARE ALL MY HATERS AT $615? Anyone “should have listened to Kevin”?
"Free-DUM how are those 6000 shares doing, most bought at higher prices I keep track"
Hey longs it’s like a nightmare you can’t wake up from. On its next double digit run up I’ll short AGAIN. Letting you know now. Listen and you’ll make money. Don’t and sit there and eat it.
"Will be back at $600 very soon.GPK, ready to breakout."
No one needs NVDA chips except almost everyone. I have never lost a penny short selling this junk stock that I will admit. Listen to me when I say this stock will close below $380 today because I wouldn't lie to you.
AH don't mean much. No volume . Still their best quarter ever. And they raised . 6 upgrades at least before the weekend.
From 615 to 463 and not one uptick. 463 to 519 and already a 20 downtick lol  gap 463 needs to be filled trade accordingly
Like I said 1000x NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite! This is now 1000 stocks blowing out earnings and tanking! We are in a tech bear  market! Buy AMC BA oils etc
Gap at $504 and $532 need to be filled
This will go back up. stop complaining
@TrapperKeeper12 > I'm still waiting for your clear explanation on why NVDA is a $35 stock. Give us some of your wisdom
"Good news is for me I work shorting NVDA basically for a living, that’s all I have done everyday since August 2020 and R.I.P. the stock in here 24/7; think  HUANG is happy he sold $1b in stock above $550?"
One trillion dollars. Soon.Nvidia is king.
GME up 100% today due to short cover
great earnings
Looks like the pending 4-1 split I predicted has traction(cough). Hehe 
"""Kevin"" go show your postings to your parents and caregivers see what they think"
NVIDIA..what a fantastic ER and good job. I added more more when dip after last ER. It was a wise decision. Surely I will do the same thing this time. this stock is a long term buy and hold for sure.
They should rename this company YoYo.
"""investors""that followed CRAMER this week got killed...nvda, crm, etcHe is a scam"
"futures ripping, especially nasdaq futures. Looks like we’re gonna continue with this momentum upward. $NVDA $WIMI $BA"
Nice rebound on heavy volume. You can't keep a good thing down.
We haven't heard from Needhams Rajvinder Gill yet. He is the authority on AMD.
At this time next year nobody would have heard of Cathie Wood. Mark this post.
Pain beyond imagination  begins in 2 minutes! I feel so sorry for anyone stuck long!
another great day! thank you!
LOADING UP MORE EVERYONE.....GREAT CHEAP PRICE NOW....BUYING ON DIP....
up when market down. Larry not satisfied 
"I told you, weeks ago to dumped Nvidia when it was $620- 610, 500, 590, 550. Undervalued AMD is 100x better investment than NVDA."
Buying short term calls... what a joke this last week has turned out to be. Stock trading bots are out of control... My opinions.
Commie CEO should have split this but that isn’t part of the game plan. He LOVES these $20 daily drops so his corporate buddies make bank
I may close the short 585calls today. I’ve drained 17 contracts at $15 per. Thanks.
6 Analyst so far adjusted price targets today with average low projected of $616 and an average high of $680 for those 6 adjustments.
NVDA has to rise 25% to get back to where it was last week LOOOOOOLLLOOOOOLLL
Go dowwwwnnn damit
"If this corrects again tomorrow like the past 2 trading days I am going to begin adding aggressively.In increments.......but aggressively. The stock is now in bear territory having corrected over 20% in just weeks and after supper earnings quarter. Will, also, include Broadcom."
So great to be short NVDA the second the market closes it gaps down then gaps down on the open by $10 like clockwork
"Buyers rush in for shares @ 525! They rush for NVidia. The plandemic is here to stay 4 ever, so work@ home and games instead of long flights ( evil evil co2 ) will be there to take over the analogue world we leaf behind. Prepare for a new HAPPY live in a virtual reality ."
is it bingo time at the home when they all scream bingo at once especially the twins
$615 to $467 this week and I haven’t covered a single share. Will hang on until next March long term short. Already owe millions on my cap gains for my put options
"Just joining YF Message Boards. Mkt pulling back big time these last few days. This gives us an opportunity, if you have the dry powder available to add to names you like. $SNAP at $60 is nice, as is $PINS in the low $70s. $SQ, $NVDA, $TWLO and others have meaningful upside as the market looks past temporary 10yr bond yield rise. Also like $TSLA. This is just a pullback, stick to your guns and add to names you like long-term (if you have the cash available obviously)."
"If the QQQs go fill that post election gap at $276 it'll be another 8% down. If NVDA went down another 8%, we're looking at 440ish. At this rate, that doesn't look unrealistic at all."
Pain hasn’t even begun yet. Wait until $299 this week. Buy every put option you can get your hands on
To the MOON !!!! 
Will close below $500 a share today. You should sell now and wait for sub $140 share price.
This stonk NVDA is R.I.P.  Anyone in at $602 last night in after hours?
Just too easy
Still think huang doesn’t orchestrate manipulation? This is why it hasn’t split. All the big holders benefit from this huge volatility
The 15th time NVDA has been down $20+ since July 
"Kevin, are you going to be 0-4 this week to date? I know you are losing big on GME and with your calls this week for NVDA, getting close to the time for you to go to bed Sir! :-)"
The institutional buyers are going to use every trick in the book to get these shares cheap before the ARM acquisition is approved.
This is an echo chamber of day traders #$%$ off to every 0.01% price change lmao
Heading to Sandpearl resort for lunch. Thank you NVDA for all the profits.
Short life savings CRWD PYPL NVDA TSLA This is the most money I have ever made in a day in 30 years of trading
QCOM CEO “If not for supply constraints we could have sold everything we made.” You will be hearing the exact same story from NVDA since TSM is also their chip producer. QCOM down 10% so NVDA will fall minimum $50+
When ARK Cathie Woods and Cramer are both long a stock sell it hands over fist
7 trading days ago this was $615. Nothing criminal to see here. Keep it moving

Nvidia will close in green. The upgrades today are massive. We even got a new street high of $800 from Needham. Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
NVDA down $15Will be down $50 tomorrow on AMD newsPlease trade accordingly
Everyone here listen to my inner loin short 513 cover 463? See my GME 182 to 220
"Did you think Qualcomm would smile at the Nvidia-ARM deal, huh? Or Intel? Of course they are angry. Nvidia is stealing their lunch. Nothing they can do about it though. The deal will go through. Nvidia is king. Soon to trade in the trillions."
Wow. $611 to $600 in literally one second. Not the type of stock you want to own into bloated earnings.
Just remember this everyone: last earnings NVDA blew out earnings upped forward guidance huge said “running on all cylinder” AND the stock fell from $540+ to $510 the next day!!!!!!!!
"Why in the world  honestly explain to me why anyone would ever own a stock like NVDA at $545 here? It’s already had its run. It’s never going higher. You are never getting rich from it anymore. I understand buying at $10 to $100, BUT why would anyone not sell here and buy something else?"
If they investigate Nvidia and arm for anti-competitive problems they should investigate the x86 Monopoly that's been dominating the industry for decades.
Still remember KevinTheLoser who once said that his shorts vary from $468 to $589? Although he still has his shorts from the 180s not covered yet. His shorts are officially 80% losses. More to come.
I am thinking about picking up 50 shares of NVDA today while hoping; a) the share price will not go much lower than the current $550; and b) that the earnings announcement tomorrow will be good. Good entry point or am I catching a falling knife?
Has NVDA ever been down $15 and gone green? Never! I can name 10 instances since just July that it’s been up $15-$20 and gone red 
"Option expiration, no one is going to hold over the long weekend. $590 here we go !"
"All institutional and retail investors dumping shares will squirm in agony when the ARM deal goes through and Nvidia obliterates it's ATH. I've been in many companies that drop 50% or more, only to double or triple in the following years. It doesn't take a high IQ to do well in investing. All that is needed is a strong stomach, lack of emotion and common sense. Sometimes it is wise to go against popular opinion and make your own path instead."
Never seen it's so cheap to buy after its e/r...it's time to buy more on low and sell high as long term.
Keep thinking there is no manipulation. Never buy/trade with your heart . RULE #1
be ready to hear from shorts again :-) LOL
Weren't we supposed to go fill the gap at 463 today? Bwahahahahaha.
Made 1000% so far in 7 of my put option positions expiring Friday and haven’t sold one share of one of them @ 517 
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite So simple yet so easy
"Look at an intraday chart of the S&P 500, an intraday chart of the Nasdaq and an intraday chart of NVIDIA. A rising tide lifts all ships and vice versa. 2 steps forward one step back. All aboard the NVIDIA TRAIN!"
20% up move for NVDA after ER like ITRI has done this morning WOULD BE OVER 110$ up move for NVDA
Its a beat $3.1 at $5B
I LOVE INVESTING IN THE FUTURE!!!!#BA #AAPL #Wimi #BFT #PLTR #NVDA #CRM #TTWO #REGI
all tech stocks are sinking like a year ago
"Thesis intact. The 600calls will take a drubbing tomorrow with this action. All 600 calls - worthless, as far as your calendars go."
$20 daily drops are the new norm. Thanks huang
$600+ very soon!!
Looks like Kevin is wrong again. How is it humanly possible for someone to be wrong 100% of the time?
$5 GONE!!!!!! BWAHAHAHA
I have seen a lot of things BUT I have never seen a stock fall $50 on blowout numbers NVDA had......
"I see Qualcomm is rejecting the ARM deal now, not good  at all for the future of NVDA R.I.P.  I see we are all back to the usually NASDAQ up 20+ and NVDA red. So simple yet so easy. Will be $504 after earnings, down 20% bear "
Just drove my Bugatti to my Gulfstream on my way to the Maldives  (all paid for by my NVDA short).
Up 10% today
I think $543 here is the forever high in NVDA. Trade accordingly
Zero interest at all in NVDA going MUCH lower
"While Merrill Lynch raised the price target on NVDA to $625, they also downgraded dot-boy, Legend, CrapperKepper, Darth, and NG to reprobates."
UPGRADES comming along tomorrow the way it should....
"Already going back up. Record earnings, possibly some upgrades today or Friday. And definitely hedge funds jumping in"
even if US10Y rose to 3% it would have no effect on cash cow like NVDA. TSLA investors should be worried though
"WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!! CONGRATULATIONS TO ANYONE THAT BOUGHT AT OR BELOW THE 200 DMA. SCREAMING BUY ZONE RIGHT THERE. THAT DOESN'T COME ALONG OFTEN SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF. AS I SAY ALWAYS KEEP YOUR PODWER DRY. ACCUMULATE CASH, DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON A WEEKLY/MONTHLY BASIS....THAT'S HOW YOU WILL GET RICH LIKE ME!!!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!"
"In the near future I will increase my position in this 'complete winner' by 40+%. This will be my 4th largest position. I believe in the future of this great company led by one of the best CEO'S in the country, if not the world."
Are we cruising past 580 today? I think so.
"NVDA is acting exactly like FSLY & QCOM before earnings. Down 40% and 15% after earnings. You see rookies, earnings are the great equalizer"
"Tanking next week....no way stocks survive a bond maiming, BTC crashing etc. More pain to come...."
Down $40 tomorrow.
Last August NVDA was $589+Now in mid February it’s $598Bank  checking account pays more
There really should be an IQ test before you can buy NVDA stock.
"This sell-off after a strong quarterly report is unfortunately in line with what other companies are seeing. While a few have seen price surges, many companies have not been rewarded by earnings beats. It's baffling, to say the least."
What are the odds that the NVDA and ARM merger will be allowed ?I am having trouble wrapping my head around this. Any opinions would be appreciated.
Big funds are exiting market. Check the sudden drop on the opening. Everything is included in the earnings. Be safe. I am buyer after correction. The correction hasn't started yet. I will not touch over 336.
I would short 514 here with every penny to my name if anyone is long here. Trust me
"Any chance we can drop $50 to $100 today? Anyone here remember $615? My god, honestly, what were you all thinking?"
"Benjo bashed it in the low 500's too btw, check posts ...Benjo:"" I know nvda very well"". Yeah right. Bad track record."
"from nvidia's website. 2 days old: Ericsson recently published their 2020 mobility report, noting, “5G population coverage is estimated to reach 15 percent, equivalent to over 1 billion people.” Meanwhile, DFC Intelligence reports, “there are now over 3 billion video game consumers around the world.”Cloud gaming is at the intersection of these two trends. And GeForce NOW is the world’s leading cloud-gaming platform for PC gamers, offering hundreds of games from NVIDIA’s own data centers in North America and Europe."
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE! LIFE IS GOOD MY FRIENDS! LIFE IS GOOD! DID YOU DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN DURING THE NASDAQ CORRECTION?

I HAVE ADDED 2500 SHARES SINCE THE CORONA SELLOFF WHEN I WAS BUYING BIG CHUNKS.REMEMBER MY LESSON FOR YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN PREACHING ON HERE SINCE 2016 NVIDIA BREAKOUT.....DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN ON A WEEKLY/MONTHLY BASIS AND TO ADD AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING MARKET CREATED DROPS!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!"
"It is dropping because of the decline in Mellanox. It seems investors only care about data center, cloud, or subscriptions."
Nice to see ARK buying shares today

Finish strong! Who’s buying Long Calls on NVIDIA to reach 1k by year end? I don’t even know what that means but I’d do it. To the moon!!!!
mission control all systems green for takeoff
So much for never seeing $500 again. It is $501+ AH now.Nvidia is king. All hail the king. To one trillion dollars and beyond!
Analysts are going boost the target to 700 to 750
"Be honest, anyone in here able to recall when NVDA was $500+? ROTFLMFAO "

Welcome to the 600 club!
Have great weekend neutrals and longs! Nvidia is king!
"$580 is a “lock” today, which would be $9 lower than where it was last August! Nice  “investment”."
"Great days ahead. Love the gyrations, need down movements to buy more shares and make more money. Looking good for a nice $10+ move tomorrow."
Who is going to ever buy a stock again that fell $150 in a week on great earnings?
100% chance NVDA tests $470 after earnings (please save this post)
I don't think we are done here yet. Congrats fellow longs.
Great opportunity to buy at the open before it goes up sharply

Did I just see 52 week high ? Yes ! Better than cannabis stocks.
Friday night is pizza night at the care facility for chronicsKevin pretty excited about it
this is better this is progress
"By the end of March I think  NVDA, in looking at the options, could possibly, with some luck, hit $550"
"Could we possibly see $504 FINALLY today? When it fills that gap down from $615, what will you all say to me?"
it is heading my forecast $103
Motley Fool army is going to push this thing higher and higher...just like LMND and OPEN.

Let me repeat the question NVDA $474.61 or Inferior Intel or undervalued AMD?
#FACTS: NVDA is now lower than where it was last August 2020
@ Kevin... how many barfing posts are you going for today? Don’t you have a job? Or maybe this is your job...
"A quick napkin calculation for Salamander shows:100’s of borrow days on 18 short lots. With close to $1 million shorted (minimum 1800shrs x avg $531 at 1.8% avg borrow rate), Slammymander has gushed $5000 in borrow fees alone. Those are spent. In addition the position is $135,000 in the red. If on margin as Slammymander Kev says, the margin call is this week."
Almost reached $498 but no cigar yet. Daddy needs $499. Let's go !
One year low after solid earnings ALLLLLLRIGHTTTYYY THEN
"Better chance of hitting Powerball MegaMillions 100 weeks in a row than NVDA ever trading higher again! Save this brilliance please! If NVDA found a cure for diabetes cancer AIDS SARS Bird Flu Covid-19 heart attacks strokes, the stock would still go down"
Retest $467 by noon ?????
LRCX...can't make chips without it.
7 months of gains wiped out in 2 weeks... good lord
is nvda good to buy now for long term? newbie here. thanks
look all im going to say is NVDA is the future that will help the future be a better future!BANK ON IT!
Longs: is anyone adding more heading into earnings?
Everyone on here is holding. I queried last summer.
200 day is now broken  and it’s a Friday sell now or you will get margined out $299 or bust next week
so gaming sector is booming and autonomous ev sector as well .... 200$ down in no matter time is way to much smells really fishy  GME soon will be worth more than nvda .... this stock market is trash and fake manipulation they will value my old shoes more than nvda and amazon combined soon .... redicolous.....absolutely redicolous..... 0 sense 
"Be honest, anyone here old enough to remember $614? I don’t either to be honest!"
NVDA shareholders @ $615->
NVDA has literally zero support. $490 was her last hope. Could easily go back to $100
Time for act two. Let’s see how that useless PM indicator holds up. That being said....”What time RED”? Huangs buddies need some more of your money
growth stocks getting whipped like rented mules
Anyone remember the NIO collaboration? LOL  $66 to like $35 on NIO and NVDA $615 to $460 since the big hook up! I remember thinking  they will both eventually drop 75%
"Keep an eye on the QQQs. If it breaks 300, it'll probably go fill the post election gap at 276 and set the tone for the whole tech market. That would be another 8% down if thing dropped by a similar percentage."
Getting pretty sick of the DOW going up every day. That and hearing about Kevin's loins.
amc poppin
I just saw Ford is cutting back their F-150 due to supply constraints with the chips in their trucks. NVDA is going to get beat like a red headed stepchild on earnings day due to not being able to make/sell enough chips
buy the dip! $TSLA $APPL $NVDA $AMZN $ETSY

Almost 60% upside according to Needham. It's not a matter of if but when. Needham thinks it's this time next year. Cause that's how price targets are set. Forward pe is now 35 while growth is yoy over 50%.
Wait how can anyone say anything about this awesome company? If your long which everyone should be always in amy stock they invest in whats the worry? Semiconductors are on fire massive demand little supply=massive sales. End of story
Nasdaq down over 400 points and NVDA at lows of the day is a BUY on the dips in this area. Good Luck
you think our twins keep moving the end zone....time for art class
shorters will get burned. This is why you dont only graph trade.

NVDA is going to $504Just watch$589 to $595 since last August
$618 was hours ago. BWAHAHAHA
Easy $400 target breaking support

"As a rule, I do not believe in conspiracies. That being said, it seems like a lot of negative news that impacts the stock market often happens at the end of the week. Yesterday, the big story was the rising bond yields. And now the bombing strike in Syria.Two negative stories at the end of the week. Many people may panic and sell today because they do not want to""hold over the weekend"".Sometimes it seems like these events are orchestrated to cause a selloff. Just saying."
Will see $1000 quicker than you think
"Consolidation is over, this is going to be 800 by earnings."
"Institutional manipulation. They waited for the good earnings, the stock goes up and then they sell the heck out of it. How else could the price drop so hard and fast?"
I am shorting $492 here and buying 480 puts expiring tomorrow
cover yet shorts
Why the massive rally today ? thanks
$567 LOL  Now that is hilarious  Doesn’t anyone know the golden rule? What is it? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
"Anyone not short with the NVDA 600 puts into earnings is so far beyond a TARD that they can’t possibly be helped. Load up  da truck . Not one stock has rallied after earnings, especially fabless chip stocks like AMD QCUM & INTC all dropped 15% after earnings, which would be $100 for NVDA! Load up on the 600 puts into earnings, you will make a small fortune "
"pretty sure NVDA has gone down nearly every time it has reported earnings, and look at where we are. in the current stage of time with economic uncertainty and corona,it's a norm"
This run up is awesome right mario? 
At $481.99 I told a loser in here NVDA would trade $299 before $482. It fell $10 without an uptick. Also at $557 I told someone it would trade $504 before $560.
You all laughing  now at my inner loin 535 & 513 shorts? Does anyone in here have any clue of how powerful I am
"ok profit takes subsided and ready to roll!nvda jus got an additional $500B in addressable mkt - EV, autonomous driving, smart grid tesla autobidder, expansion of crypto, cyber security AI chips, new generation switching fabric, 5G and 6G wireless, solar and on and on"
All of 2020's winners have become a source of funds to buy Chevron. It's really quite remarkable.
Kids were betting and laughing at me ? I trade with conviction. I see 472 to 336.
It will be 700 in a week.
VIPUL is 100% correct. Why would you ever hold a stock that literally falls $15 almost everyday?
"I never thought I'd be saying ""Hope it gets past 500!"" again."
25% in a few weeks! wow. not sure what to think. good grief
"both amd nvidia asml & tsmc shareholders.Nvidia (Nintendo Switch, Benz) is the King of GPU period yet AMD (PS5, Xbox, Tesla) is catching up really fast."
"With an ER like this and forecast and completing the ARM deal, they could be a $1000 per share company by the end of the year, if there isn't a split before. This is a good win for people who own it."
"I would be very interested to get a midday report from the Bash-Boys on today's performance of Nvidia, and when it will turn red?"
Certainly looking forward to another blow out earnings report!
Great exit stage right here
Anyone heard from Sal/Kevin/Legend?
"Dealer informed me my new gas guzzling 4Runner arrives maybe Friday. Thankfully I don't need $$ from NVDA, but those Covid relief Biden Bucks will help pay for his soon to be $5 gas."
BMO Capital just raised NVDA target to 680 and keeps strong buy rating.
"Ignore all the ups and downs you sissies, that is how a stock market works, all that matters is where you buy and sell in the end, if you can't stand Volatility between trades go invest in a CD"
Helicopter money has arrived. Futures up. To 700 we go.
I am getting tempted to buy at $515 for a quick bounce tomorrow. All I need is $520 open.
NVDA is only down $105 this week and people are complaining what rookies just wait until 275

"Qualcomm, Microsoft and Google are being just a LITTLE bit hypocritical. Qualcomm has paid their share of anti-trust fines, and both Microsoft and Google have their history of buying up other companies and trying to crush competition. Aside from pushing AI forward - Nvidia is already a leader in AI without Arm - they'll be competing with Intel. As for Intel, they're getting into graphics cards. Nvidia and Intel are also competing in cloud data. The real battle shaping up here seems to be between Nvidia and Intel.Jensen has said that he would maintain Arm's neutral licensing model. Moreover, not only has he said he would maintain Arm's current operations in the UK, but expand it. The Nvidia website states:""Opening the AI research facility for collaboration with UK industry leaders addressing the world’s most pressing challenges.""""Expanding research partners within the UK through research fellowships and partnerships via the AI research centre.""""Helping UK start-ups grow through access to the Arm supercomputer, NVIDIA experts, technical training and marketing promotion.""Seems pretty clear that he would agree to stipulations that would address most concerns. As for export control, which would be China's concern, Arm CEO Simon Seegar stated that it is ""...governed by where the technology is created in the first place. That doesn't change with the change of ownership of Arm.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8HTfQi548The US would not be able to restrict China's access to Arm because it is British. In other words, this is a non-issue. The US could ask the UK to restrict Chinese access, but that's politics and could happen with or without the deal. The US and UK are close allies. That is something China will just have to accept."
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY TODAY. NASDAQ SELLING OFF DRAGGING DOWN GOOD STOCKS. BUY NVIDIA. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.
the Giant is awaking. I guess every long is happy today to see it finally reach a new high after so many months of hibernation.

NASDAQ up 322 and NVDA at the lows of the day. There is a chance it falls $50 again today
Anyone pay $515 this morning? LOL  or $615 two weeks ago? $463 today
Now we see if Kevin the liar posts again after the 463 gap fill promise goes limp.

I still can’t stop  laughing that someone paid $611 today and said they were impressed by how well the stock was doing after the big run up
Like a bad dream huh 
wow I think it's a great price for buy back !!!
The American Rescue Act is law now so expect $$$ from direct payments to find a home in growth stocks as soon as the treasury starts sending out the $1400 per head direct stimulus payments. Hold on to something we will be heading higher.

"I am sure ""Legend"" is getting very nervous at this point as now is back up to $554.70 at today's close. Hope that he has covered some of his shorts on the way up. Never have understood the stress of short sellers and surveys have consistently shown that short sellers lose over the long term. Me, a few years back after downsizing ,and being retired looked around for some good growth stocks to enhance my remaining years found NVDA and a few others. By remaining long with NVDA and its 1,500 shares my profits to date exceed over $700,000. Could I have increased that gain by playing 'shorts'over those few years? I doubt it and the stress and risk of wrong short term decisions over that time would no doubt have destroyed the joy of retirement......better to head to the casino as at least it would have been fun playing. Anyway, longs stay firm as NVDA is a great company with the best products. AMD, had some of their stock but quickly realized that their products, mainly CPU's have become almost obsolete and they have hung on and gained market share only because lousy management by Intel allowed it. NVDA has no real competition and won't have any for a number of years, maybe never so hang long!! Every market they deal in is the future of technology, medicine, entertainment, eCommerce, problem solving etc. If you are into stocks it doesn't get any better than that!"

Path of least resistance is up. I see a rally to $560 today. Boy would I hate to be short this stock right now.
Anyone who is long NVDA over $480 needs a lobotomy
Wonder what would have happened if they didn't blow by expectations. NVDA now trading at early 2020 levels
really wanted this puppy at 500+ by eod bummertook the money and ran on 490a near double wanted more should get a better entry on expiring calls early tomorrow

I repeat 472 to 336.
Anyone notice INTC is at all time highs? Was $40 when NVDA was $600+ now INTC is $65 and NVDA is $499
Ignore the premarket. Look at GME judging by its momentum Nvidia has a good chance to be red again. Last time GME took off it hit the broad market.
@Legend continues to be so wrong on everything. Consistency is his/her strength.
EXACTLY $100 lower LOL  from where NVDA was two weeks ago #FACTS
Looks like market movers are repositioning after pumping so much. They know what move will be profitable. Sentiment with a stock does not help
"Clearly people have learned nothing from the GME fiasco. Far too many stocks are priced beyond fundamentals, like NVDA for one, and people keep buying it. LOL!"

"Why SENS NOW? I really like this Biomedical scientist explanation. “ I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years.

Over 600..... I can breathe again.

I see it at 336 support.

Nvidia is a great company. I am sorry you are down big on it but i think that Jensen Huang is doing everything right but the stock has fallen out of favor right now along with many semi stocks. I have to urge patience; this is a terrific long-term investment
"All Shorties, game over soon."
"NVDA has gone from 615 to 515 without an uptick and the NASDAQ is still 13,100. I would say longs are R.I.P."

NOT!SHANGHAI and SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NIO, a pioneer in China’s premium smart electric vehicle market, and NVIDIA announced today that the automaker has selected the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022.“Autonomy and electrification are the key forces transforming the automotive industry,” said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. “We are delighted to partner with NIO, a leader in the new energy vehicle revolution—leveraging the power of AI to create the software-defined EV fleets of the future.”“The cooperation of NIO and NVIDIA will accelerate the development of autonomous driving on smart vehicles.

"NASDAQ 14,175 to 12,500 a nice 12% correction 8% more and another March bear "
Would you look at that RED AH!!!!
Good Report; Good Earningsand down we go????
"NVDA announcing the NVIDIA CMP, or, Cryptocurrency Mining Processor, product line for professional mining."
Oh my God Applied Materials beat by a pretty wide margin and gave a very upbeat report. Applied Materials makes equipment which makes chips. They also mentioned chip shortages. Applied Materials up over 5.0 % in pre market. WOW. Love the chip sector. Buy individual shares plus FSELX a semi conductor mutual fund offered by Fidelity. I am sure other families of funds offer a semiconductor mutual fund too.
"NVDA better start producing some chipsets soon, or this stock is going to tank to $100"
"Chip Shortage + Cannot keep graphics cards in stock = no profits for NVDA... great company but this is going down, ill rebuy at 400 lvl"
LarryTheLegends time on this message board
Anyone here see my GME @ $300? Love  how you all ignore my calls & I am never wrong. The info I give in here for free I have people paying millions for on the Street
"Mario, can you UN-Mute Trapperkepper12, He needs you today."
Are we aiming $525-$530 tomorrow?? What do you think Guys??
"$MSTR is just smart! Buying Bitcoin woke up the miners. I own $BFARF, $DMGGF, $HUTMF, $HVBTF, AND $BLOK. $HUTMF already owns over 3000 Bitcoins, but $BFARF and $DMGGF have just started banking coins themselves, following $MSTR's lead. $MSTR is a little high priced for me, right now. I am still looking for that 1000 percent gain. Hopefully, these miners will get me there, and quickly. Then, I will have to add $MSTR to my portfolio. I did own it back in the day, along with $QCOM, $NVDA, and $AMD; however, I had to get out. Good to see $MSTR going back up! Any company holding bitcoin is going higher and higher without doing anything. How cool is that?Good luck!"
You ok bears?
"NVDA down $27, GameStop up $55, #$%$ type of market."
Update: Nvidia’s Defensive Coordinator “FREEDOM” has not checked in for three days now. Authorities worried he may have fallen in a tree well while skiing off piste at Squaw Valley. Ski Patrol is conducting a search.Thoughts and Prayers.
Let's be thankful ER wasn't yesterday with the terrible sentiment the had hit bottom. Today is the first day in 2 weeks all Big Techs are OK.
THE CEO TONIGHT AT CNBC
550 tomorrow fomo will come in and buyer will rush in to buy NVidia best in breed
Amazing  how many calls for $1000 and to the exact second will drop $20 today like clockwork
3.10 vs est 2.81
yikes
COULD BE ABOVE $600 TODAY ANYTIME SOON....WAIT AND SEE....BE PATIENT AS HEDGE FUNDS LOADING UP MORE MILLIONS....
Congrats y’all
I could “feel” RED  inside my “loins” today by 10am at the absolute latest. TRADE ACCORDINGLY
So INTC is down 10% on record earnings that will take NVDA down $50+. Save this brilliance
NVIDIA partnering with $NIO is HUGE news. Welcome to the NIO family guys!
NVDA was $512 in July 2020.NVDA is $512 March 2021.My checking account paid more.
Okay longs consider the following scenario. You are trapped in a world of collapsing growth stock values when suddenly a worm hole opens up offering you a fleeting chance to escape the misery. Do you go through the worm hole not knowing what awaits you on the other side of the worm hole or do you stay inside the shrinking technology stock collapsing universe>? The worm hole being any day the stock is up. The other side of the worm hole being any other NON high growth technology investment. Choose wisely grasshoppers.

Legend is losing money and likes to come here and cry.
"I put in an order to buy 200 at $470, went out to walk my dog, came back and it filled. Yes I can ! Looking to take profit at $495 and will ride out my $513 buy. Too easy."
"Day traders fix this stock each day buying into it and then cashing out. It's tiring to watch since it makes up the highest volume of my main fund. Oh well, its doing well right now but it used to be at 584 at its high. It's been struggling to get to 550."
My name is rider
very bullish day. let see if we can do a back to back tomorrow with some follow thru
"Cramer tweeted ""nvidia is a good buy at -5%"". Well it certainly is even better when it's down 8% then. Gonna watch Jen's interview in a few hours at ""mad money""."
"KEVIN TODAY, ROFLOL"
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. NVDA will be $460 tomorrow night. Supply constraints. Everyone knows that though earnings leaked 3 days ago @ $615
Either new tripple top #$%$ or new double top at 540 range. There are NO Buyers for this overpriced stock!
"Cov 19 is ending....it's time for money to rotate from one sector to another...nvda benefited a lot from cov 19...people abandoned work and stay at home playing Nvidia powered games...now they need to get their a...back to work...airlines, restaurants, amc will do better next..."
If the car industry is booming then why isn't there a shortage of other parts. Wall St wants the Reddit traders to squeeze the shorts in the chip stocks.
Still crying laughing  just thinking about $540 yesterday morning. What were you all thinking?
The easy money gravy train is now officially over. Time to reapply at McDonald’s
$504 again I still can’t even remotely comprehend how this was ever $519. That’s the forever high
"This is painful, my portfolio has been wiped 25% in a matter of a couple weeks with great stocks. Hoping for a better day on Monday, Longs. We will recover , buy when the market is fearful ! $APPL $TSLA $AVGO $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA $PYPL $SQ $BABA"
"While I firmly believe the market is very over valued and on the verge of a huge correction; perhaps when it comes to a tech stock, Nvidia might be a safe haven."
Bashers were wrong by 100pts...576 coming...
Blowout Earnings
"Facts ""NVDA saw options trading volume of 183,533 contracts, representing approximately 18.4 million underlying shares or approximately 185.7% of NVDA's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 9.9 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $500 strike call option expiring March 12, 2021, with 9,821 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 982,100 underlying shares of NVDA. """
NVDA down $85 this week and falling no bottom in sight!!! R.I.P.
You want to hold NVDA into earnings? Look at QCOM wow  NVDA will be under $400 soon!
"Believing and catching this great opportunity low price, buy more and holding, this should be the right way of smart investors...not to get panick unless not knowing how to invest in stock."
"Target up from 600 to 700 by earning, chip shortage led to more demand then supply n crypto hype increase demand of nvda chips to mine crypto"
"Nvidia Up 128% up in a year, since market crash in last March. It will be another 50-70% up with arm deal and new gpu's. Great stock. Great company. "
Anyone see KevinTheLegend? That guy is amazing! He was never wrong once for like 6 months. I sure miss him.
Few hundred shares traded around 568 giving impression it went down. Going up to 700 by end of next week.
@SalamanderJohnson worry about your bank account instead of NVDA. Still up $50 for the week. Rest in peace
NVDA shareholders tomorrow night will be all trying to squeeze out one small door at once all at the exact same time @ $460!
"As is always the case, its going down faster than it went up."
Anyone think a stock split is on the horizon? Asking for a friend!
Hope these earnings are through the roof. Anyone taking a chance of selling now and seeing what happens? This could go to 650-700 in a blink.
Oppenheimer raised it's price target on NVDA to $700 
AH means nothing. Only regular hours matter...
This will never dip under 500 again unless the sky falls down. And I doubt that. There are always individuals who think 500's is not a bargain. While I think we'll see 700 somewhere in august. That's 3 earning reports btw. Sorry is always late.
All shareholders of NVDA holding since July $589 NASDAQ up 5000 points are LAHOOOzERS
Making the call NVDA falls under $500 today easily just watch this blood  bath 
"AMD, MICRON, TAIWAN SEMI, TESLA ALL DOWN MORE THAN NVIDIA.BUY THIS MARKET CORRECTION.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.IF THE MARKETS SELL OFF MORE BUY MORE."
"over the long haul, nvda is a must own hands down the best in semi sector"
Don't be greedy. You can never go broke taking profits. There are plenty of other fish in the ocean.
https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/09/qualcomm-and-nio-bring-immersive-driving-experiences-intelligent-cockpit$QCOM $NIO $NVDA
$614+ still???? NVDA is now lower than august of 2020 #FACTS
added more...this is a gift with blowout earings in 48 hrs...
"I am surprised by the Nasdaq bloodbath but I guess it was to be expected. Good play by all you shorts that had the timing right. Like any other phase, we get past this interest rate uncertainty, get the stimulus passed, get the vaccines out there and things should go back to an uptrend. Why? The fundamentals are there for growth. This company is still solid. The one nice thing about being long, I can hold and wait it out. Shorties, enjoy the day. Hopefully you made a good chunk of your money back with this one."
"Hey kevin, rumour has it, the repo man is on his way to take your Bugatti away. Do you have any comment?"
LADIES & Gentlemen boys TARD LONGS AND GERMS  what time blood  red today?
Nvidia's HUGE dinosaur chips days are numbered. Intel Xe will arrive soon to make the dinosaur extinct.
will nvda hit 640-650 on earnings/outlook? oh boy
Nvidia lost marketshares to Intel in graphics. wccftech has the report.
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Any questions from any new bagholders?
look out shorts and scare mongers the NASDAQ went GREEN
AMD is red now. Be careful. Greed is not good.
"shook out ALL the weak hands, LOL"
Closed 28 points under the 200dma.
"shorts, I'm guessin' easy 535 today, higher also possible. Should have bought more short term calls when it was at 470's but my leaps are doing great as well."
$615 was what...... 45 minutes ago? BWAHAHAHA
How those “futures” looking? Who would ever hold any stock over the weekend? Amateurs
wake me up when its $700 .... 02/24 :)
There is a better chance of winning Powerball 2 weeks in a row than NVDA ever hitting even close to $600. Save this post.
LOLOLOLOLOL @ all the people on these boards that think every decrease in share price is because of shorts.
Tech stocks are like market heroin. People can't resist buying them.
"added some, we're down because of some other stocks being overvalued and dragging the nasdaq down on a blood red day, look at tesla eg."
Stock expected to Blast Off following earnings release on24th of this month. One of the best Growth Stocks anywhere.
80% (32) of all analysts have a strong buy/buy on nvidia. 20% (8) say hold (7) and only one sell. They're increasing price targets by the day.
NVDA 800 by july. CALLED IT 8 MONTHS AGO!!!!
On useless days like this an options expiration Fridays I go play golf and do not check the market. It has served me quite well for the past 11 months to accrue a nice bag of cash.Add in a dovish Fed and I will patiently hold.Staring at a ticker all day is what these manipulating miscreants want you to do.Have a great weekend AMC bulls.Also a quick shout out to my other favs after AMC.Long and strong $AMC $NIO $BRCX $PYPL and $NVDAGo out and enjoy life and patiently hold onto your shares.
"Honestly, NVDA is the only stock I have ever seen where the bag holders are cheering “down only $15”."
We’re up 17% YTD. We will be up 100% +. like last year. Clearly the Class of the Chips in What 2021 has been deemed The Year Of The Semi’s. As good as it gets compadres. 
"I am now officially down to ONE NAME, “Legend”. Like Cher, Elvis, Bono, Whitney, Prince, etc. I may even expand on my name one day soon to SIR LEGEND, after getting knighted"
Nvidia can't make enough GPUs to keep up with demand.
ARM deal update coming with earnings. 11th is earnings date and I see $600 on the 12th.
Did you all forget NVDA fell 60% last March! Guess what month is almost here? Lol 
Great opportunity to buy more!
Why is it only 1% not 10%? any explanation
"I don’t think  NVDA will go back to $180 Covid March low BUT I do think it will go back to around 400 or so; then again $467 yesterday is already basically $400.........Like AMZN NFLX NVDA etc all FAANNG stocks that “stalled” last July, this is a real problem, they never rose when the market went up, BUT are the first to crash  when the market goes down"
give me 510 today
This STONK NVDA never goes down ever! Kathie Wood  ARK like $615
Anyone doubt now that MMs are manipulating the price pre-market and AH ?
GREAT CEO....will be positive CC. Will be listening.
$600 tomorrow guarantee
"10 yr is about to come down anytime now, according to its rsi"
"$615 to $570 right before earnings is NO BUENO! The “overhead” pressure on the stock is R.I.P. to all longs, no matter how good the earnings are. Know how many RobinHood rookies are margined NVDA into earnings? OMG "
What time red????? Any good  guesses? 9:30 AM EST
NVDA producing all it can 24 hours a day and still can not keep up with demand means NVDA earnings and revenue will go above all expectations.
Everyone listen  to me please: Short NVDA here & buy the weekly 500 puts expiring tomorrow
Celibration Drink
This is where you need to question why did you invest in this company to begin with.Did anything fundamentally change? Did anything happen from last year to today.... if the answer is no. The dips deserve to be bought.
Pretty impressive price action for a friday. Monday will be very interesting.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
i want that 30x gain on 490p past two days
NVDA will be down $50 today by the close. Save this brilliance
"Wow. Just dropped $20, the NASDAQ just fell 200. In less than 5 minutes."
There's a lot of daytrading shorts leveraging with options putting the pressure on but that won't too much longer at the 200dma level. Good Luck

$563....waiting for Kevintheloooser $504 to load up again.
"Do NOT initiate a position in NVDA because “it looks cheap” down $85 in a week. The “trend is your your friend.” Going under $500, and fast!"
ARM holding founder coming up on CNBC soon...
MM's trying to keep price low AH so that they can cover their calls at open ?
I am shorting more here @ $521. I honestly think it’s a gift from god
I’m out. Started a position in Roku instead......

$400 is fair price
Absolutely destroyed on a good ER. Still think these markets are on the up and up?
If the ARM deal goes through do you know what the price will be on the stock? Maybe 900/1000
Just shorted more NVDA $547. Thank you  god.
"breaking: alibaba just announced a new EV sedan, using Nvidia chips"
Can we get 550 already
Numbers will be good. Guidance will be poor and huang will misspeak again. This will result in a bloodbath AH
Better chance of finding a cure for cancer than NVDA ever trading over $550 again ever
Bid movers after hours.$IRBT $UBER $TLRY $SNDL
"folks this is babba. don't waste them dough shorting Nvidia or any technology or any chip sector folks. if yo liveth on a mountain even then yo need technology and so on and so forth. very naive to short at this time or ever. dont do it. dont sell either folks. yo never get better or rich or very rich by puttin that dough under your bed, in the mattress or in a bank saving account or even what they call what they call CD. ain't paying nothin to write home about. no bonds either. open yo horizon and invest in the stock market. Folks. Thanko"
Kevin gets thought a lesson today! NVidia will never be under 500 again in our lives
Where are the cheerleaders with their Pom-Poms?
NVDA is peaked for now.
I am out. Thank you NVDA. Going green soon.
Merrill Lynch raised it's price target on NVDA to $625
Will Nvidia be around 5 years from now? Tech moves very fast and everyone has GPU's now including some chinese companies.
Crazy market! Like the up days
Good lord these markets tanking in literally a few seconds is so rigged and criminal it’s absurd. It’s getting worse. SEC really needs to start clamping down on this. Only big banks reaped any benefit to this massive drop that quickly. The manipulation is NOT a free market.
"NVDA easy a $600B company! cripto, cloud, gaming global explosion and it offers the best chips in the mkt, order pipeline never ending"
"CNBC:...Ultimately, Nvidia sales were up 61% year-over-year.Investors had been expecting revenue growth over 55% from last year and Nvidia beat those expectations, even during a worldwide semiconductor shortage.Nvidia also suggested that its hot streak would continue by forecasting $5.3 billion in revenue for the current quarter, ahead of investor expectations of $4.51 billion.(5.3 billion is 17.5% higher than the previously expected 4.51 billion. And, NVIDIA will beat 5.3 billion)"
About those 600calls. Where is that ^IMOTHY kid. Is he with the option kid splitting pudding today?
Thank your new president for that.
we go up tomorrow boys
Oversold. It is plunging because they make a ton of free cash flow in growing business segments? It is trading below enterprise value because there is no future for a company like NVDA? I’m going contrarian.
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE!HEADING OUT TO ALPINE MEADOWS FOR A POWDER DAY. WE JUST GOT SOME FRESH SNOW IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC.LIFE IS GOOD MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS! LIFE IS GOOD!BUY MORE NVIDIA ON DOWN DAYS, DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN."
"Arm deal is happening, Nvidia never said they won't continue to provide licences for the arm technology to other tech companies. It's just Matter of the time. Future is really bright for Nvidia."
$521.85? REALLY? It has to be fake news. Anyone remember $589 last August THREE BLOWOUT EARNINGS AGO
I honestly don’t think NVDA will ever trade higher ever again this $540 area is the forever high
Hock Tan of AVGO and Lisa Su of AMD are much better and less flashy CEOs than Huang of NVDA.
650 within a week after earnings report.
"If AAPL went from $145 to $129 after earnings $112,000,000,000 in 3 months, with no supply constraints, tell me how NVDA stock is going to do?"
All part of investing all part of investing. Baron’s had a lead article today on how phenomenal NVdia’s ER was. I subscribed also to JC and he just released his two Best Buy’s as Amazon and Nvidia. My personal belief is this price action is all contrived to shake out weak hands and then the big money buyers will pile in. Seen this movie many many times. NVDA is still the same great company it was yesterday. Actually based on that ER even better. Market manipulations notwithstanding 
P/E 70 for a hardware manufacturersure buddy
"Well last earnings the stock was $545, so almost even Steven"
Anyone like NVDA here at $480 in after hours down $13 OR $615 last week bwaaaaa 
So I am long GME huge and short NVDA huge......pretty bad day for me LOL  NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite NVDA was $589 last August will be $504 tomorrow
just imagine to be short here and then you have additional news after the bell...thrillseekers.
"GameStop fell $100, down $35 more in after hours and a 1yr price target of $13.44..now I know why Kevin Legend likes it and is long the stock."
again for the cheap seats. 5 billion is sales in a quarter. so 20 billion in sales for a year give or take. 390 billion market cap. which direction is this heading? haha um...
NASDAQ +400NVDA up a pennyCongrats  to all long and call options buyers R.I.P.
Was there any doubt NVDA was going to crush their numbers? No doubt here. $$$ stock will be over $600 tomorrow. $700 in March.
Congrats to those who bought the dip at $591!
I am pleading & begging everyone in here to sell 521 and get short it’s going to $300 down 50% without an uptick like last March
Nice manipulation by hedge fund longs.
"I was in another forum with another junk garbage  poop  stock like NVDA down like $100+ this week, and a kid said he’s $300,000 on margin praying the market goes higher or he will lose everything! That’s who is investing! Sell NVDA tomorrow open and short to $300. Fell 50% fake Covid last March and going to fall 50% again to $290"
"I just freed up another $1,304,000 in shorting power on margin so here I go $486"
Where would NVDA be if they missed earnings and guided lower? $300?
Alert  warning  THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE OF HITTING POWERBALL & MEGAMILLIONS THAN NVIDIA EVER TRADING HIGHER EVER AGAIN
nvdia will be in apple cars & phones
Once 200 day breaks it should go to 299 in a week or two
"How can the bashers on this board say this is a garbage stock when earnings were through the roof?Scratching my head, though, on why this is down so much?Hmmmm"
more cowbell....FREEDOM where is more cowbell? :-)
Wheres my Pepto Bismol. I'll need double dose today.
Sal after the 20% run up....
NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite...........You all been studying  this AMAZING equation since July/August of 2020. My team of advanced Ivy League educated mathematicians came up with it. No charge to you!
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
Look at big tech earnings. Data Center results set to explode for $NVDA. And gaming revenues to hit new high due to the holiday season.
NVDA still down $30 from right before earnings and still down $50 from last August and $65 from last week. ANY QUESTIONS? Asking for a friend.
Nvidia earning great. Head fake after hours. Get in early for 5% surge Thursday
You all like 615 last week or 460 now?
"in my mailbox from Cramer: ""buy broadcom on earnings disconnect"". I think there are better options when it comes to companies who were disconnected with their earnings."
"So 99% of the “people” in here, and I use the term “people” very loosely, think  NVDA is “going to $700”. Reminds me of the QCOM forum at $170, right to $140 like clockwork!"
Do you all remember the day recently when the NASDAQ was up 500 and NVDA was up like a penny the stonk was $554 that day. Dropped $60 straight dollars since
Gonna close my group down soon. If you like Cramer see my FB group Action Traders. Must be a US Resident is a minimum requirement. I am trying to help the average guy. I might ask you a question.
I'm swearing lol honestly
"I think NVDA goes from $606 this morning to $460 this week. I have been saying that for months. Buy $50,000 worth of the 500 weekly puts for pennies, sell them Friday for $40!"
market pullback = opportunity to buy. pullbacks are normal. don't miss the boat!
Larry is over at GME board perhaps
"HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAS VEGAS,NV! HAD TO FLY DOWN FROM TAHOE TO TAKE CARE OF SOME ISSUES WITH A PROPERTY I HAVE IN DEVELOPMENT. WORK WORK WORK. THAT'S ALL I DO WHEN I'M NOT SURFING, SKIING, FISHING THE PLANET, SCUBA DIVING AND LIVE LARGE. LOLHEY!!! ARE YOU GUYS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS NASDAQ CORRECTION? THIS IS A FANTASTIC BUYING OPPORTUNITY. I HOPE YOU HAVE BEEN RAISING CAPITAL. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN! I JUST PICKED UP ANOTHER 500 SUB $470, AMAZING! ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MARKET FORCES TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. BUY WHEN THERE IS BLOOD IN THE STREETS. ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!"
"Expect to see a lot of shorts on the message board today with fear mongering.Facts:NVDA posted blowout earnings but being pulled back with over all market from 614 to current price.It dropped 3 straight days with yesterday down 5% alone with extended hours . These fast drops are usually met with big bounce backs especially after 3 days in a roll and now Friday with options expiring. And with Nasdaq down around 10% level as of yesterday, its due for a sharp bounce. Good Luck.Blowout earnings on all metrics: Adjusted EPS was $2.18 vs. the $1.24 analysts expected. Record revenue exceeded analyst expectations. Adjusted gross margin was much higher than analysts expected. Recently acquired Mellanox Technologies Ltd. helped drive revenue growth."
NVDA will never even come close ever again to $600 A LOT of bagholders from $611 wow 
China Joey needs crutches/assistant to help him. He can hardly walk.
Keep it going!
These shorters will get burned soon enough lol. This stock will grow a lot over the next year.
"Nvidia price targets as high as $800, with average $638. Google ""WSJ Nvidia Research Ratings"""
I hope Jensen has some bright ideas to implement to stop this.... maybe a stock split?
OMG NVDA up 0.01 in after hours. Sell and short it 
Accumulate and buy in every dip
gave a buy call at test of pc yesterday gave a close out call at 521 todaywanted more kibble but 200% in less than a day is fine and nailed the 465 to 518 upmove
Never selling.
DOWN $100 in 11 trading days. Effuhuang
"Fasten your seatbelts this stock has bottomed out, now back to $600 ++"
$590-$595 close coming. Oh No !
"1,000% on nvda 3/12 500c in two dayssweetupside down a smidge on 500c reentry at retest of pc and didn't close out we'll see"
"NVDA expectations are way to low, they will blow past 5 Billion in revenue"
0% chance of closing over $500. Please trade accordingly. No one is holding over a weekend. Gap 463. Sell now so my weekly 510 puts I bought for pennies could make me $500k
"I keep trying to find a reason to sell but, have failed miserably."
Narrow trading range until earnings then great numbers and then the......... huge FLUSH over $20 AGAIN
GME is dropping faster than snow in Boston.
Does $NVDA own bitcoin or they produce and develop mining rigs? I just bought shares yesterday because the price bottomed and did not have time to do enough DD but also cannot find an answer anywhere. Asking for a friend
615 to 483 going to 450 tomorrow and won’t cover one share or sell one put unless they expire tomorrow. Waiting for $299 in March which is down 50% like last year
"$525 sell filled and I am still in my pajamas. $1200 profit, Sure beats digging ditches."
NVDA disappointed in crypto mining auto sales & data centers. Doesn’t anyone read the earnings report?
Watch this death  spiral close then wake up to lock limit down futures on employment numbers March crash  2
This stock is manipulated by the market makers. On Monday it jumps up 10 to 12 . They sell call options and on Friday no action. All the call options expire. This has been a trend for last 3 months.
sellers are loosers later as it 's leaving the train and moving up fast higher in just a moment...with tons of new upgrades today....to $700
$504 is coming and there is absolutely nothing that anyone in the entire world  could possibly do about it sorry to say please trade accordingly
Ouch! Good day to buy!
Will be “down $100” by the close! Good luck to all longs
The market did not reward NVDA for it's last earnings beat. Perhaps this time will be different.
market reverse .... back to real prices!!! BTW when the p/e ratio changed on NVDA ? just realised it today!!!
She’s going under $511 by the close. VIPUL you like $525 rookie or no? Inner loin 513 short cover 458!
Comes down to the guidance now. Nice beat up and down 
$610 and moving up
congrats longs.
Buy on the rumor AND sell on the news. Pre-market is just crazy. Great buying opportunity here. NVDA had a FANTASTIC quarterly report.
earnings will be a huge W. watch and wait
"Earnings report going to turn this train around? I wager the biggest problem NVDA reports is the same one they reported last call - ""unable to keep up with demand"". A real quality problem as Cramer said then."
A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL SHIPS. I'M HEADED TO KONA BIG ISLAND TO FISH FOR MARLIN AND YELLOWFIN TUNA. I HAVE PRIVATE CHARTER COMPANY THAT I PAY 6 FIGURES FOR MY YEARLY FLIGHTS (LOOKS LIKE I AM SCHEDULED FOR A CESSNA CITATION OF SOME SORT) TO AND FROM SANTA BARBARA/TAHOE/VEGAS/ CABO/NYC/KONA-KAUIA. DON'T BE JEALOUS. BUY NVIDIA AND GET RICH LIKE ME!!!!
"This market is so manipulated, this is a $1000 stock and on sale today. Buy, buy, buy this overvalued stawk. price to sales is still 25...should be 10 like AVGO."
"1 year ago the stock prices was 261, I think in one year from now the price will be 1000+"
The shorts are so afraid coming into earnings that they have to post every 2 minutes with something negative. Good sign for longs!
I don’t see any stocks ever going up again under this President
Last time it did this it dropped 200$.....qcom anybody?
"OK, IT'S TIME TO PARTY ON THE NVIDIA TRAIN!ALL ABOARD!CHOO CHOO! ROFLOL!"
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!NASDAQ DOWN OVER 300 POINTS!!!!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN GREAT STOCKS LIKE NVIDIA!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
just don't sell
$620 tomorrow. Nvidia simply manufactures demand.

Easy 610$! Crypto and earnings play
The typical NVDA long
Are ‘.’ and DT on a 5150 Hold?
I have more money in my back pocket than Boeing will make over the next 5 years and the stock makes a 52 week high. Upside down market. Earning season starts next month and tech will take leadership again.
Just like J said ...see ya $600
Watch the cliff dive the last 30 minutes
Nice pull down action. There will be take off soon.
"Hey shorts, one single little bullish word from Cathie at ARK and Nvidia instantly goes to $800+. Just saying. Hah! Hah!"
Gonna break out this year.
all of a sudden NVIDIA multiple matters
"625 by earnings and 700 after earnings, 1000 after arm deal. Good game kevin!"
NVDA is the greatest stock ever to short I have been short huge for 6/7 months now and I never have to ever worry about anything it never ever gaps up ever only gaps down
I short NVDA on every uptick since August and haven’t lose money even once
NVDA 3/19 $700 call @ 0.60
Will be $504 sometime before earnings. How is anyone still long if they have any clue about charts moving averages & options?
just like that 600 is in the rearview mirror
Sell the pop open big tech is over
"Shorts our out in full force today. Drive it down so I can buy more. This is one of the best companies in the world, firing on all cylinders."
Is Everybody cashing out? can't believe it....
Is February 16th the same as September 2nd 2020 ? Semis made 52 week high and then collapsed.
Boards pretty quiet. Looking for a pre earnings push to the 540-550 range. Tomorrow with options may see 5 teens again before moving up. Good luck to longs. Selling calls in the 540 range selling puts in the 520range.
This thing better hold that channel lower boundary around $492 or it may go to $400 in short order.
Nvidia is imploding. Longs need to run for their life. Just admit to your family and friends you made a horrible mistake investing in NVDA. If they care about you they will forgive you.
"What NVidia really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for NVidia (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if NVidia just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Just came here to laugh at larry
Why would anyone buy & hold NVDA ever when you can trade it and make millions
Kevin will never reach his only short position at 299. He has never shorted from anything above that.
Rotation into Pharma and dividend stocks such as PFE and LLY now the play
"Up in a down day, what say you shorties. Reporting all of you to my Reddit pals."
NVDA stock is a ponzi which will come to fruition on February 24
I will add on any dip below $525/share.
"I quadrupled my money at $587.08 but waiting for at least a decuple (yes, 10x) of my money. Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
Closing under $500 today GUARANTEED feel it in my inner most loins 
"as the long-standing market axiom states---where financials go, the market soon followsand financials have had a big time run up past month to new all time highs on xlfthat's a good sign for market"
nvda 2/26 550c just shot from .75 to 4.00 boom
"My analysis as to this selloff - One or more of the following reasons1. Retail investors/reddit selling before april 15 tax deadline so that they can pay taxes2. Investors rotating out of tech into oil and other #$%$ stocks3. Big players shaking loose hands so that they can buy in at low prices4. MMs causing weak hands to sell because they want to close out options cheap before ER5. MMs shaking prices to rinse and repeat what happened in March 2020. 6. Program bots selling based on treasury yield misfunctions and related #$%$7. Some investors worried about the crypto issues flashbacks from 20188. Some talk about the chip supply chain having limited supply9. Some talk about the chip supply chain having a ""glut"". See (8) - LOLFurther - It wasn't because that ER or guidance were anything less than stellar. It wasn't because the analysts are raising targets through the roofIt wasn't because Cramer wasn't talking up this stalk.It wasn't because Jensen was not hopeful on the ARM deal. It wasn't because ARK and other funds are buying Nvidia like crazy.It wasn't because there is a short supply and extreme demand for Nvidia's productsIt wasn't because the automotive, data center, AI and cloud markets are going through the roofIt wasnt' because the Pandemic is getting over."
It 'll be UP HUGE tomorrow as soon more upgrades comming along...due to great e/r....
Smart shorts will be covering today. Bull market back on
If NVDA doesn’t hit $460 within a month I will never post again
See ya $600
Two biggest rookies I have ever known: FreeDumb and Kelpesh. Two novice broke West Virginia Mommies basement rookies
RED RED RED I TOLD YOU ALL INNER LOIN 513 to 458 next week 100% guaranteed I will make another $1m plus in put options
NVDA tests its 200 day MA $460 next week at the latest
$504 here yet? Wake me up when it gets there today for sure. I promised you that gap would be filled easily even at $614
As predicted one hair was out of place RIGGED
"This next leg down is taking NVDA to $504 gap. Then $490 200 day MA, then $299 by April tax day"
why ever sell NVDA unless you were into retirement already..?
Sorry about the AH price action guys... happens with these overvalued overbought overhyped on CNBC stocks Check out PSTG (Pure Storage) while it's still under the radar. ARK is in heavy just waiting for it go mainstream. Get in before the talking heads on CNBC get a hold of it. Peace !
kevin and freedom are prime examples why chronics should be relocated to fema camps in remote deserts with no internet access
NVDA is really just back to where the stock price was 4 weeks ago. Not a crash. Be a buyer at $480
market manipulation.... ir worked back year ago it will work now again ..... simple way the rich making money....
Want to know why I make millions? I short stocks everyone is bullish and long stocks everyone is bearish on. These forums help me so much.
Bought 5 at 534 in November. Holding for 600 by year end!
I feel bad for the guys that sell at this point 
"Let's see $25 down day today. Yes NVDA can ! It was great trading this stock from $515 to $553, I am not touching it at this price."
I'm going to hold NVDA 20+ years.
Too afraid to look  saw the huge blowout quarter and raised earnings and trading $600 early in after hours is it $650 yet?
"So 100% of the people posting before earnings for AMD QCOM INTC all chip stocks were all saying the exact same thing they are saying in here. Take my advice, you had all better either sell or load up on put options into earnings this stock will drop $150 on supply constraints"
time to buy
PE still 90 and sales to market cap 30. Way overvalued. Most expensive chip stock.
NVIDIA WILL BE $750+ BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS
"you can expect a post from larry that says,""i just shorted at $597 after hours' LOL"
"Relax longs - ER coming up, I trust Jensen to give us good news... Best."
"there's been no correlation between nvda's pps and bitcoin the last 6 months, just sayin'."
"I PREDICT IN 3 WEEKS TIME, POST EARNINGS, NVDA WILL HIT $600 ! COULD EVEN TRADE HIGHER DUE TO SHORT COVERING."
TO THE MOON !!!!!!!!!! N️
NO stock falls $42 without an uptick right before earnings suddenly if they weren’t leaked.........
So $480 pre market what time honestly do you think  the $463 gap will be filled because there is no way in the world  it’s not eventually filled
i see 700$ coming!!!
"Anyone laughing at my inner loin 535 & 513 plays now? I didn’t think so. I hear rumblings that NVDA is going to warn next week or a major downgrade, plus the ARM deal falling through"
I will buy this dogsht company on its way down. Will add another 4-5 stonks at 400 and will buy 50 @300!!! EFF Huang!!
"I agree with Larry; the ARM deal will not go through and the stock will tank $100, BUT you know what, it might be a good thing, I am hearing there is a huge chip glut forming, too many chips no buyers"
https://screenrant.com/nvidia-rtx-30-gtx-rtx-20-graphics-cards-why/
NVIDIA IS BREAKING OUT!NEW ALL TIME HIGHS RUN TO $600+
"Continue to add shares, these dips will not last long... interest rate news will be short term noise...mm will be back here in days"
"Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is hitting new all-time highs (finally). Technically it did so on Wednesday too, but barely.The stock made a powerful move in 2020, but topped out in the summer and has traded sideways for months now. Earlier this week, it gave bulls a monthly-up rotation over $560.After a slight stall, shares finally powered up to and through $590. Now over $600, bulls are clearly in control.What we want to see now is for the stock to maintain over the $590 area, which is the prior all-time high and former resistance. If it can do so, it keeps the 161.8% extension as a possible upside target, up near $660."
100  upgrades and NVDA is collapsing. The stock is down $40 since July. This is a good company BUT time to sell
Do NOT SELL ...This got positive future growth Potential as will be needed in all coming EVs technologies as will hit 800+ with TSLA...
Can we get a wellness check on Larry? Watch for raised guidance on the earnings call 
Where you at Kevin/Sal/Legend???
we're off the lows on the nasdaq. Might crawl up even more. Fingers crossed.
"Coming out with a new book  if anyone is interested, called: NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite"
https://discord.gg/UzkWteuAgx
Wow this Larry dude should be nominated for the Darwin Award! 
I hope this continues to tank. I've been trying to purchase GPUs to mine and it's so hard to get supply
Inching up slowly towards Kevin's daily gap fill at $520.
"We'll see how options play in on this Friday; last trading day of the month. Initially hoped to see close to 590 today, but I have a feeling it stays pegged 545-555 and starts moving up next week."
If you bought on 1/27 for $513 your Happy!If you sold on 1/27 for $513 your sad!and that’s all I have to say about that.
Can’t wait to see up $5 pre market then down $40 by noon  CRYING LAUGHING 
I really just can't fathom anyone betting AGAINST this company? pick something else. NVDA has it's tentacles in almost every industry..
"nvidia is the next trillion dollar market cap stock, every quarter is a beat, every guidance is a raise!!!"
NVDA now down $65 from highs into earnings. Thank you Mario I shorted $563 on your “green” post! Doesn’t anyone in here have a clue about options? They control this stock
"All I can say is let the day traders play their games, may the best man win. In the mean time, I will hold tight and watch as I ride up and hold."
Holy cow. yeah I'm buying Nvda at 510. not many opportunities like this.
can this close at 510 on a 2pm to close mega buy in?
The only thing that makes me happy is that Disney sunk to 192.
"Nintendo has increased its forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31st to 26.5 million Switch units, also boosting its net profit estimate 33 percent to 400 billion yen, or about $3.82 billion. ... It was also a massive quarter for Nintendo in terms of software sales, with nearly 76 million units sold."
$611.50 inAH
Nvidia and AMD should switch color because Nvidia is red every day rofl.
"The re-opening stocks are already priced higher than pre-pandemic and some may never fully recover. Gains moving forward will be slow, like watching paint dry. Those that are accustomed to the rapid gains of growth stocks will become discouraged and return to growth. But the smart money never left, or added. Another move higher is inevitable. The recent drop was an excuse to shake out the weak."
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!LIFTOFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!EARNINGS WILL BE MASSIVE.BUY NOW!
"I can only imagine that options book kid. Leafing through pages madly trying to figure out what’s wrong. Oh well, those 585 were just an added bonus to the 600c pile on the short heap."
Still $615? Not near a PC. Anyone like my GME?
one of the great bargains in 21st century history
news about ARM deal and earnings are slowing leaking out......
BUY THE DIP!!!GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY TODAY! BUY THE MARKET GENERATED DROPS!!!!
New all time high after ER
To one trillion dollars and beyond.Nvidia is king. All hail the king.

"Just sold $10,000 worth of the weekly 520 calls for $1.40 So simps"
"I'm so disappointed with this stock. My stock portfolio looks pathetic and who knows how low this will go. I'm not selling cause it's too late for that but in the future, I'll be sure to be more diversified the next time around. I was too heavy in NVDA, bad mistake."
"What's behind the drop, according to this news article:Nvidia (NVDA) shares are lower following earnings that at first were cheered by investors who then turned cold on the stock.""The outlook for the all-important Data Center business disappointed on the margin,"" Evercore ISI says.Credit Suisse says the ""lack of DCG upside, Crypto uncertainty and ARM overhang will continue to be headwinds on the stock,"" referencing uncertainty about its planned acquisition of chip-design company Arm that is under regulatory review. NVDA is still a strong company with a coveted product line."

every 3% is good for almost 20 points right now. It's good to be long nvda. Just lean back and let the money come to you in your sofa while the shorts are getting buried and lose their sleep and appetite for food.
Will Kevin’s Magic Formula hold up today?Or will he continue to amass losses on All of his Shorts???

"I love  the “perma bulls” they said “$700 after earnings” for a month, now the stock is down $20 after earnings they are saying “$650 by the close tomorrow.” The path of least resistance is LOWER"
Sure am glad I got out with a small profit at $550.

"Not wishing any bad luck on anyone but I wish this thing would continue to sell off , I sure would like back in , not sure what price I would buy at though"
"Nice momentum divergence in place on the intraday chart and held the lower boundary of the channel at $492. Hopefully, that was the bottom for now."
"Hope you guys bought under $500 when you had the chance. Won’t be seeing that again for awhile, if ever."
Only down $25Shocked how well it’s doing today actually Congratulations new RobinHood bag  holders
This was the final proverbial nail in the coffin  for NVDA will bottom $299 this year and everyone in here will claim they bought more every $10 down and originally bought at $1
"Some hedge funds must be closing shop , they are selling everything fast and furious, the price doesn’t matter they want out"
"Kevin has retired the name Kevin due to financial calamity and has re-named himself ""Sal"" in order to begin a new financial identity."
Went across to Florida west coast now for another 10 days from The Breakers 100% paid for by NVDA longs I sell calls non stop every month and buy outs never lose ever $1200 a night here getting away cheap off to $1000 dinner 
My GME up $50NVDA short down $50LOL 
"I made one of my few mistakes by selling this a few years back at about 140 after buying at 180. No worries this time, even if it means waiting 10 weeks for the next ER."
Down $100 today???? NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
I'll predict we open tomorrow at $625 and hit $675 by closing
I have a feeling that this will be close to $700 by Friday.
Which analyst will be paid to raise price 666 on Friday 355 pm
I think it is more than options expiration. Maybe the ARM acquisition.The ER will be very bullish.
"10 year at 1.30, Powell-Yellen are clueless. Order to buy 500 shares at $450, I will get it next week."
"Before last earnings in November HUGE numbers upped guidance NVDA was $545. Blew out twice, was $589 last July/August, now $530. LOL. You do realize FANNG stocks have been R.I.P.  for 7 months now."
 Nvidia just announced they are changing their ticker symbol from NVDA to TURD 
"Patience will be rewarded. Short term actions will not. Hold Nvidia long and find out. Not a pump, sell to your hearts content. What Nvidia is trying to do will take time and won't happen over night."
Watch the inevitable beatdown later in the day. The pattern of past ER’s will remain
@kevin > Looks to me like you will be wrong on both counts:Legend18 hours agoMy GME and NVDA hit $500 tomorrow or I never come in here again. GME will rise $300+ and NVDA will fall $30
even after amazing results stock is down. it is so disappointing
Pe should settle around 25-30. Still waaaayyy to expensive
"NVIDIA Unveils AI Enterprise Software Suite to Help Every Industry Unlock the Power of AITuesday, March 9, 2021Runs on VMware vSphere; Optimized, Certified and Supported by NVIDIA; Hundreds of Thousands of Customers in World’s Largest Industries Can Now Adopt NVIDIA AI Enterprise at ScaleSANTA CLARA, Calif., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite of enterprise-grade AI tools and frameworks optimized, certified and supported by NVIDIA, exclusively with VMware vSphere 7 Update 2, separately announced today.Through a first-of-its-kind industry collaboration to develop an AI-Ready Enterprise platform, NVIDIA teamed with VMware to virtualize AI workloads on VMware vSphere with NVIDIA AI Enterprise. The offering gives enterprises the software required to develop a broad range of AI solutions, such as advanced diagnostics in healthcare, smart factories for manufacturing, and fraud detection in financial services.With the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, IT professionals at the hundreds of thousands of enterprises that use vSphere for compute virtualization can now support AI with the same tools they use to manage large-scale data centers and hybrid cloud environments. The NVIDIA software suite provides scale-out, multi-node, AI application performance on vSphere that is indistinguishable from bare-metal servers.“Until now, the world has run AI on bare-metal servers,” said Justin Boitano, vice president and general manager of Enterprise and Edge Computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA AI Enterprise enables customers to reduce AI model development time from 80 weeks to just eight weeks, and allows them to deploy and manage advanced AI applications on VMware vSphere with the same scale-out, record-breaking NVIDIA accelerated computing performance that’s possible on bare metal.”“Every enterprise is exploring how to modernize their infrastructure to meet the demands of AI applications,” said Lee Caswell, vice president of marketing for the Cloud Platform Business Unit at VMware. “With NVIDIA AI Enterprise and vSphere 7 Update 2, VMware customers are now able to fast-track AI in their virtualized data centers and easily deploy certified, AI-ready infrastructure for their modern apps.”Powering Advanced AI at Enterprise ScaleAmong the first to use NVIDIA AI Enterprise for vSphere is Optum Technology, part of UnitedHealth Group.“AI plays an increasingly important role in the data-driven services Optum provides for United Healthcare,” said Justin Potuznik, senior principal engineer at Optum Technology. “With NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software and infrastructure running on our VMware vSphere environment, we’ll be able to power our modern application workloads and efficiently deploy AI at enterprise scale.”Flexible AI Infrastructure for the Hybrid CloudNVIDIA AI Enterprise provides compatibility for a broad set of accelerated CUDA applications, AI frameworks, pre-trained models and software development kits running in the hybrid cloud. Optimizations enable workloads to scale across multiple nodes to support large deep learning training models with full GPU virtualization.To power the applications in NVIDIA AI Enterprise, VMware vSphere 7 Update 2 is now certified for NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs on NVIDIA-Certified Systems, which include high-volume servers from Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro.

On average NVDA drops $10 at some point from high to low almost everyday
WOW--WOW--WOW--BAG Holders dream come true !!!
Nvidia price target raised to $665 from $600 at Cowen 07:27 NVDA Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $665 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst believes gaming is a secular growth market the company dominates and which is still in the early innings. He noted demand remains well above supply for both gaming products and datacenter chips.
Remember 2020 February/March meltdown ? Coming soon.
Anyone see this little you-know-what touch $564 to the penny and drop like a rock  off the Empire State Building? Where are all the analysts calling for $700? You had to know you were all R.I.P. when “they” put out a $700 PT and the stock fell $80!
"They’re afraid Nvidia will limit access to ARM’s technology, but why in the world would they do that when they could make so much revenue licensing it. MSFT with a BS complaint like usual."
at day highs NVDA train is back on the tracks...BOOM!!!
"Anyone playing MARGIN in this absolutely crazy market, God help ya!"

"If for whatever reason the ARM deal does not go thru, Nvidia will offer full CUDA support, all software stacks, full AI capabilities, advanced data center support, and full accelerated computing for ARM to offer all customers who request it. Nvidia would rather own ARM, but the overriding objective is for developers to rely on Nvidia for the most advanced AI supported software, hardware, and support in the world regardless of what CPU they choose. ARM will enter in a strategic relationship with Nvidia not needing approval. ARM knows that they are unable to offer anything near Nvidia's complete solution. Nvidia will be ready with full-implementation in about a year it takes for the projected deal to get approved, or not."
Shorting $480 stock here will cover $299 next week
zzzzZzzzzZzz. Seeeeellllll
"Just a few selections from the legendary loser's comments of the last week.

NVDA will gap up 10-15% post earnings. Shorts may drive it up even higher by end of the week.
"Thanks nvda your now in my 100,000 club with 190 shares"
Nvda releases it’s CES report 1/12/21 at 12pm. Has consolidated nicely last couple months and could possibly break out on news. As increasing buying volume might indicate.

Folks you READ it Right Here (so it must be true) I can change on the Market Cap of NVDA. longs will thank me later.
"Invest in tech, invest in tech. How about xom and cvx? Unbelievable. Keep going up with oil."

"I know this is a crazy question, but do any of my fellow Nvidia longs also own INTC? That stock is so cheap right now, but does Intel have a future once Nvidia & Arm merge? Given the favorable outlook for the broader semiconductor industry, you’d think Intel could still be a decent grower over the next 10+ years. Am I nuts? I’m still an Nvidia diehard, don’t worry. Just looking at some other names..."
$400’s!!! Yessssssss!!!!! LOL I doubled down $510 expiring tomorrow up 300% in 10 minutes omg lol
"AI, autonomous cars, Bitcoin, games - all run on NVDA. Even military and SpaceX are using NVDA hardware. Demand in 2021 will be astronomical"
"Stock is priced to move higher significantly.First City Bankers, adding to their position."
Good thing we had those upgrades and earnings beat BWAHAHAHA
"NVDA is R.I.P. I don’t think  “she” ever even comes close to $600 ever again, what a “head fake” at $615, I didn’t panic a bit, shorted more. I made more today than every long in this room has made in their lives."
"Hyundai and Kia confirm they are no longer in talks with Apple regarding Apple Car productionhttps://9to5mac.com/2021/02/07/apple-car-hyundai-kia-production/This means that the partnership between Hyundai/Kia/Nvidia is secure, with Nvidia providing hardware/software for self-driving cars."
NVDA will gap down at least 20 tomorrow am so don’t buy it here going down 50% from 614
Great don't complain if it goes to 450. I'll buy more I like it down much more because it's sure it will go up after it hit 300 some time
Kevin owns this stock.
Imagine if NVDA didn’t blow out earnings and raise guidance?
"Without Nvidia the chinese EV-companies will have uncompetitive products. SAIC, NIO, Li Auto, Xpeng. For that reason alone the Nvidia-ARM deal will go through. China needs Nvidia. China wants to take the worlds EV-market. Nvidia is one of the chinese tickets to do that."
Shorting $512 here! My “lock of the week”! Trade accordingly! Any weak shorts cover $614 when I “doubled down”?
If the ARM's acquisition goes through even those at Google and Apple agree would make Nvidia a potential trillion dollar market cap company. The debate though is that rather than creating further market opportunities for Nvidia they say they would corner the market. I disagree and believe that an agreement could be worked out in the form of a settlement stating that they wouldn't cut Apple and Google off. Will see how this plays out but now even though I posted weeks ago that the market cap would go to a trillion you have analyst's now saying it would increase Nvidia's market cap by at least 18%. That's an understatement to say the least.
My expiring today 550 puts I just bought are up 300% LOL  Man this game is easy
Don't miss the bag holders Conference. Pls bring in Coffee n chair. Rest we can handle.
This set back is only minor. I am a rock!!

You guys have no idea how much money I made today. Tomorrow will be 100x worse for longs. I’ve seen this pattern before! NVDA is going to $299
I think today it's different. I am from Europe and I have seen the trade here today - there was nothing above 500 USD
GME up $103 now in ah! lol

"""Again, it’s demand, not just supply constraints, that are keeping graphics cards out of our hands.

"""nvidia's gonna be huge"" (Jensen Huang-2/25, mad money). Not that the longs didn't know that already."
I think  tomorrow NVDA trades $460 and never goes above 200 day MA again ever
Demand demand demand. Shorts will get burned. You old timers are playing by the old rules. Keep thinking we going back to pre COVID times. Times are changing and tech and ev will dominate the market for years to come.
I just hope Kevin gets back from the Maldives in time to post his nonsense in the morning....
This is bs
Ladies and Gentlemen boys & germs  $504 was inevitable now $488
HOW ABOUT A NVIDIA TRAIN? YEAH HERE’S ONE!!!ALL ABOARD THE NVDIA TRAIN!
$600 after earnings. IMHO
I’m so glad I added to my position when it dropped below $500.
Will be $460 or so after earnings for sure. Trade accordingly. I honestly can’t even imagine being long
"Another fire sale, once the bond markets figure out the next steps these leaders will skyrocket, be in it to win."
"processor shortage, Time to buy some"
I can’t help but buy this stock. NVDA is such a high conviction stock for me. Been adding since 140 and trading for nice profits while maintaining a solid position. One of the best companies in America
"analyst on cnbc said nvidia ""no resistance to 1000""yahoo, won't let me copy link to the news story."
Trust NVDA and you will be rewarded.
ONE MORE TIME FOR ANY NEWBIES: NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite
HAPPY WEEKEND MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAS VEGAS NEVADA! I AM TOASTING A TEQUILA SHOT RIGHT NOW TO ALL NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!! ENJOY YOUR NEW INVESTMENT!
Is NVDA still over $543 in after hours? LOL! Will be under $500 tomorrow. Anyone want to bet me?
Nintendo had another record quarter for Switch sales and raised it's forcast again for next quarter.
Every stock collapsing after earnings AMD margin softness is no bueno for NVDA
"The arm deal needs further clarity. Arm deal news was already baked in, when Google etc started to challenge the deal, the stock has been dropping since."
"Could somebody else explain to the options book kid how ""in-the-money"" works? When I say, the 600calls will expire worthless, for as far as the calendar can see, he is unable to comprehend. The glitch in his programming is at the point where that means, NVDA can never, ever, close above $600 on a friday. He doesn't get that. Glitch. Memebot can't get that. Wonder if the kalpesh version does?"
NVDA down $50 there lol I told ya so!! Not a difficult market at all
"Honestly longs, at $615 after finally breaking out of a 7 month trading range (head fake false breakout) did anyone think they would see the $400’s in a week?"
NASDAQ just rose 150 NVDA new lows and under her 200 day moving average since 180 last March
"GME $102, down $121. Never seen a stock down more than current price. $10 is my target."
Just shorted 537 in after hours And won’t stop until 460
Told y'all the party was over.
Larry's short covering gonna drive this up even more. Thanks Larry!
NVDA “only” has to go up $115 from here or 23% to break even from 10 trading days ago
No reason for this to be sold.
"the entire market looking like it is setting up for another correction, load up on NVDA when correction exhausts itself, this is going to $800 by this time next year"
Market realized that Nvidia has a dinosaur chip and has gone back to its roots as a gaming company.
This algorithms really know what they are doing!!!
"today:(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc.’s incoming Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said U.S. sanctions against China’s Huawei Technologies Co. may help alleviate a global shortfall in semiconductor supply.If Huawei’s in-house chip unit HiSilicon can’t get its designs manufactured, the company may order more chips from other providers. These limitations will also free up capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Amon said in a webcast with Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall...."
Let’s roll!
"KevintheLoooooser is color blind. He sees RED, I see GREEN. Hope he is not driving today."
I do really enjoy seeing the well-educated bears  in NVDA “schooling” the novice RobinHood rookie margined broke amateurs “caught” long from $615!!!!!
Wow down $60 Anyone long still??This is the forever high Will never be $500 again ever
"my name is @kevin and I made $8,296,643.00 on Nvidia today"
Disclosure: HUGE $510 short will never be over $500 again ever after today cut your losses now and get short $510
30 day rsi and price ratio is very solid for a bull trend. Steady drop in rsi but price staying afloat above 500

Cancelled my $515 buy order. I have a bad feeling about NVDA and overall market especially Semis and NAZ. Repeat of last March 18th ?
How are Square earnings? Just like NVDA tomorrow! Book it Dano! No matter what NVDA will collapse
NVDA $589 last July 2020$467 March 2021WHAT TIME RED MONDAY?
Should be down $10 at the open tomorrow like  everyday
$615 or $508? LOL 
Here's my 2 cents for NVidia longs!
NVDA $589 August 2020NVDA $550 almost March 2021#Facts
If this keeps up (down) I'm backing the truck up.
Everyone check out Digi.CN. New app that uses A.I to predict Crypto prices. Offers 7 day free traile.
if we break 460 its going back down to 430. Lot of buyers in at those levels will sell.
I honestly admit I am actually totally 100% addicted to shorting NVDA for I have never lost once
Nvidia is a monolithic chip. HUGE. Intel's Xe is a brand new design using small chiplets.
"shorts their hands are gettin' shaky...a 35 pts swing in one day , phew. That shows how fast it could retrace."
I think  ARK is down 75% this month and about to go under
NVDA is like the movie GROUNDHOG DAY........615 to 483 and everyone Is buying the whole way down
If NVDA trading for $605.65 then the new leader Undervalued AMD should be $300s........?
Anything lower than $590 is a bargain or screaming BUY...
Please unmute kevin. We are missing him

When will be the final word on arm deal?
beat & raise quarter after quarter. valuation is getting appealing again for those with a 3 year hold period. buy order set at $450.

"I'm in. I've waited for months for a buying opportunity for NVDA, one of the most dominant, compelling tech names in the market. I wanted to wait until after earnings and guidance for this past quarter. You can't ask for better numbers."
"Let me repeat you my target 472, and then 336. Learn from ZM. I declared yesterday, when that was 450. Check my messages."

"Hedge funds will not short stocks popular with Reddit and Robinhood traders ? The GME/Reddit incident is hilarious and a good lesson to big talkers and big funds.... If all retail traders decide to move into NVDA, this should hit 750, me thinks. However, many traders will also sell in March to pay their taxes."
Down $20 to $50 every day for week LOL 
There is going to be a surprise coming today on the share price close. The 2% drop will begins to go green though out the day. Watch and learn
Loved  the upgrade to $700 today when it fell to $583 zzzz 
Cathie WOOD's portfolio is getting chopped. Pun intended.

"NNVDA CMP lacks display outputs, enabling improved airflow while mining so they can be more densely packed. CMPs also have a lower peak core voltage and frequency, which improves mining power efficiency."
"This is so short term. Strong fundamentals on chip stocks will power this stock along with others like MU, AMAT and TSMC to new highs before the end of the year. Longs will be just fine while the market tries to capitalize for the very short term on bank and other down stocks. The sky is not falling due to the treasury yield rising either. Very short term."
Same old thing.. Sells for two days after earnings and then skyrockets
"News  Alert  Nvidia changes ticker symbol from NVDA to TURD . BTW, TURD  like their business relationship with NIO? Missed earnings last night stonk down from nearly 70 to 40’s since the TURD  “hook up”. "

"ARM deal was announced on sept 13 last year , so almost 6 months ago now. PPS hasn't moved since then (2 blowout quarters were included). We'd be higher without ARM so the market makes a mistake by betting against the deal being done. It's a classic case of the uncertainty over the outcome weighing on a stock. Whatever happens there will be relief."
From $615 to $483 in a week and somehow the perma bulls have been buying every $10
"Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upped his price target on shares of Nvidia Corp. to $700 from $625 Monday, matching the highest price target among analysts surveyed by FactSet."

@Kalpesh....please dance and cheer.
"Time to short. I am ready on pump. Never shorted this n any company from Bay Area, but it's tempting. Still charts r bearish.I want everyone be safe. My value is 336. Go NVDA.."
This year's theme is absolutely no forward PE ratios over 30X. Please plan accordingly. Sell now buy back later for pennies on the dollar.
NO SEC? One might as well gamble on the computers in China keeping track of Bitcoins because the manipulation of prices here by shorts or insiders or computers rules out fair investing either in growth or value. Anyone heard of SEC stepping up for small investors lately?
$20 + drops the new norm. Thank the concommie
Do not cover hot-short-stuff. Wait for Nvidia to turn green. Thanks in advance.
Happy days ahead !!!
Last March down 60%This March only down 20% so far How obvious was this crash 
There will be crying and nashing of teeth in this stock and all this before lunch. Just wait for close today when stock hits $499.
Last earnings the stock was $545. Beat and raised. $510. This time $550 into earnings. $504 after! Save this brilliance!!!

That was a pretty large drop from the highs of the day week year wow nearing 20 dollars be careful if it closes at the lows of the day it is called a reversal day and will be bad
The only guarantee is that the stock will go up or go down when earnings are released
"I was filling out a form for my youngest daughters private school  today for next year, $45,000 a year, and it asked occupation and I put: NVDA short"

Please tell me $502 was a scam fake price again no way it ever traded $500
In NVDA you own a stock that has no chance of ever going up again in your entire lives
Buy on the dips and you will be rewarded...
Surprised we didn’t get +10 today. Given the market should have been +20. Still looks good for another good move up tomorrow. GL.
How is Kevin doing on that 525 NVDA short position he boasted about on Reddit a couple weeks ago?
The whole world will digest today 's big upgrades and invest more on NVDA....up and uptrend the way it will be....
"Tesla Cathie Wood, where are you, buy high so it goes higher does not work."
"Split, split, split, split... say it with me."
Anyone see that final minute in TURD  the 550 puts from .01 to $2
Maybe some smart Wall Street chump finally figured out that chip shortage means that Nvidia can sell everything they can make and that ASP’s are rising? Nvidia is king! To one trillion dollars and beyond!
Moving along my nicely. $600 is coming soon. Whatever that gap talk of 463 ain’t going to happen. The real gap is from $600 plus. Need to fill that.
I think nvidia is the company of the 21st century. Wish I had bought sooner and it’s so expensive at the levels. Buying a little on every dip tho
$615 to $483 in a week! LOL  The “overhead” pressure on this stock is now gargantuan

Congratulations NVDA investors for the strong earnings report given by this company yesterday. I can not believe that something like these days can happen when people are rewarding companies that are not fundamentally sound and punish stocks that are fundamentally sound. I remember when some analysts did that because some did not do their research or wants to promote a stock or were late in getting in but those things did not last because people can see what is wrong and they can tell when things go fishy. I think this thing that is happening now is worse because it involves a lot of people who gang up on few stocks with some using margin to get in and selling stocks like NVDA LRCX KLAC APPL AMD ADBE and most tech stocks like semis cloud and others who have been reporting strong earnings for years and have very little debt and some with no debt. These companies are the backbone of our economy and are transforming our ways of life and yet these stocks are being hammered. This thing is not right and I hope good people will see that and reward people that do good work. Stay safe everyone and be kind to others.
Now is the time to buy. Was too cheap before
this is a good company at a decent price for true long-term investors
MSFT backed Graphcore calls on UK regulators too block NVDA’s Arm Acquisition.

Last March of 2020 was a rough month for the stock market. Coronavirus was the impetus that caused a big selloff. Here we are 12 months later and the month of March is looking a little rocky.A good opportunity to buy more shares of NVDA if it drops into the mid-$400 range over the next few days.

"OK, WHAT PRICE WILL NVIDIA BE BEFORE NEXT EARNINGS CALL? I SAY $750+!!!"
Will add more shares to this winner. The CEO is such a good one. He is the reason I will add to my already 'healthy' position. This is easily a $800 stock this year and will build on that once reached.
U bought the top

"Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $610 at Susquehanna 07:02 NVDA Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $625 from $610 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst met with management who communicated the demand backdrop is very, very healthy. He believes any supply shortage is because demand is so strong not the impact of industrywide shortages. Rolland is encouraged by the demand but believes industrywide shortages could limit the most optimistic of bull scenarios."
Where would NVDA be if the NASDAQ weren’t up 100??? Asking for a dear friend

Does anyone in here know a thing about trading? 615 to 460 is around 160 drop retrace 50% is 540 exactly NVDA 50 day moving average; how are you allowed to breathe the same air as me?
Kevin is certainly going to be even more bearish once nvidia hits $1000+
Last year NVDA fell 50% which will take it to around $300 this March
This rotation into the failing stocks of 2020 is ridiculous. Just because vaccines are going to allow people back in restaurants and travel doesn't mean everyone will be doing it. There's still those who will work remotely or were negatively affected by the pandemic and lost their savings. It doesn't make sense that people would sell the great innovative companies whose technology will stay relevant for years to come.
If red at the open I will add more!!!!
As we say here on team green.. SMASH SMASH SMASH .. those freacking shorts!
Remember NVDA fall 60% last February/March

"This is absolutely the last chance to buy Nvidia etc at this price. I believe amount of between $350 to $600 billions are about to be invested in the market via the stimulus package. The funds which go to States and state agencies will immediately go into the market specially and including the state pension plans. The individuals receiving $1,400 per person of which at least 50% will go into the market as per the study I read a few days back .

463 to 519 is $46 so NVDA should fall to around her 200 day MA 490 tomorrow 50% retracement of the move from 463 to 519
"nvda 490p shot up 8,000% in 3.5 days nvda 490c shot up 2,500% in 3.5 hrs"
Darth Dummy what happened to that $500 close?
Are we $600 yet :)?
"I'm thinking the May ER will be fantastic; but unfortunately it will be at the same time as the average American will be contending with having their wallet siphoned off by +4 dollar gas putting a drag on the recovery. I still recall 40 years searching under the sofa cushions for 50 cents change to gas the motorcycle for work, and worry about the return later that day. NVDA nice report a few weeks ago was timed a few weeks late; hopefully events don't line up against it again in May."
Scale in to Buy the best of breed starting at these level when they blowout earnings and its an overall market pull back. Good Luck
heading back up and will double by year end folks
"I sayeth NVIDIA is going to $1,000 soon.World wide shortage of Chips/Semi Conductors according to Chinese Sources . They sayeth ""severe shortage""."
NVDA $460 tomorrow night is 100% guaranteed get out now. You all wanted the most clueless human who ever lived as President. Good luck.
Kevin the stonk trader.
"From Guru3D: Two interviews have been conducted with key personalities from each company. Market analyst Harlan Sur had a chat with NVIDIAs CFO Colette Kress. According to her, the shortages are essentially caused by persistently high demand."
keep this in mind people. Without Intel CPU's there is no Nvidia GPU's. Get it. Kapish.
"Nvidia RTX 3060 Pricing Skyrockets Before LaunchAccording to a report, what was supposed to be Nvidia's most ""value-oriented"" RTX 30-series GPU to date has succumbed to severe price gouging before launch. Like all new Ampere and RDNA2 products, it appears the RTX 3060 will be nearly impossible to purchase near MSRP. On average, pricing for each RTX 3060 model is inflated by a whopping 50%.NVDA products are still in very high demand"
$552 to $532 in a half hour after dropping $50 yesterday LOL 
$7 from 52 week high. feels good

"Jensen Huang is yet another example of why when the CEO is the founder of the company the company thrives the vast majority of the time. Throughout history it has been proven this is the case most of the time: Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, etc. Bottom line, Huang is brilliant. NVDA has 63 percent gross margins and an enormous free cash flow of $4 billion. This company is in a holding pattern for now along with AMD but eventually it will awaken from its slumber and roar higher."
Most powerful stock on the market
Do not buy. Below 400 in two days
Nvidia price target raised to $700 from $672 at Truist
"i figure previous conf call, nvda said data center would be down 7% qtr 4. it was actually up.... and i figure nvda's revenue forecast for this current qtr is 17.5% higher than analysts had expected, which means nvda will beat next qtr revenue by 20% (they always beat higher than they forecast). .... Colette bored me on the call last night. I thought the call was boring. Maybe it was just me. And the quality of the call for me was poor. I'm holding my nvda..."
"I think  smart traders like me who read the NVDA earnings realized when they are saying they are selling every chip they make yet inventories rose, they are lying and why the stock fell $150 in 3 days"
Fantastic Day! Get used to it. 2021 is the tear of the Semi’s. And NVDA be DA KIng. $600 after earnings $1000 by end of year. 
"NVDA +$20 to WHAT TIME RED. Now a guy like VIPUL is smart. Out at $555, buy in around $519."
"Pe has to go to 30? Wayyy to high has to drop big time to be in correct valuation. And no, don't count on this arxxjole Schwab to get his big reset and digital revolution 4.0 done! The people of the earth don't want this despite and his fellows"
Hah! Hah!Nvidia is king. All hail the king.
When is earnings report for Nvidia.
march passed 600 today now u see the real nvda bulls!! been in since 60 know the game
Looking at the Moron gauge for this board we are near the bottom! Besides that Shorting trade becoming pretty crowded!
I'll buy 50 @300. Then all the way up to 1000! Thank me later 
"After reading all the bullish sentiment, I'm bearish now. Sometimes you just gotta use your noggin."
See how pointless upgrades and good ER’s are? These are different markets these days. The name of the game is manipulation and short selling.
42 TFlops coming.. Enough said.
bought at 533 that was my last available cash to invest ..... hope it will recover like in in September drop
I think NVDA hits $299 next week. Then I cover and buy. I swear
if this continue like this will end up at 440$ today
Waiting for the German Confucius to enlighten us with his wisdom.
Can’t believe I got another 1000 short @ 537 that’s a forever high for NVDA
Nice close
think this was priced in since it went up 150 in the last several months????
Part of me wants to buy but part of me knows AMD beat and kept falling...so I guess I will just watch for now.
This is a great company. Will be a buy at $200-250 price point
a good buy for medium term.
Lol this chart reminds me of a fast forward version of $NVDA in 2017
care-facility chronics with the emotional development of 10 year olds
Be honest: Anyone still in from $615? Don’t be shy  raise those hands and hold them high be proud be strong 
I bet it falls over $50 today. Anyone want to bet me? Downward gap 580 519 upward gap 463 498 GAPS GALORE
"When NVDA/ARM deal gets rejected + AMD comes out with better technology + a chip slowdown, NVDA will be $298"
NVDA has basically gone from $300 to $460 and falling since the biggest chip boom  in world  history (I don’t count the fake month Covid $180 drop). Not a good stock.
"So, all the technical 'folks' say this needs to get to $589.50 for a break out leading to much higher prices."
"So you are too scared to buy Nvidia? Huh? Already too expensive you say? You are weak and you are wrong. Snap out of it! No guts, no glory. When the ARM-deal clears (and it will) Nvidia will be trading at $1,000. Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
"NASDAQ, S&P 500 WENT RED. NVIDIA STILL GREEN! EXCELLENT! NEXT WEEK WE RALLY TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!"
any amount of green today is impressive
Nvidia is only a pray for arm stockGoing no were If arm fails and that is 16 months from now you don’t want to be around. This is worst than owning Tesla
"Stock trading bot algo 101 - Treasury Yields go low - sell, yields go high - sell, yields go nowhere - sell - LOL"

But it took 5 min - super strong bull power
"@Bob, you shorted at $593.65?"
NVDA is going under $300 in March VIPUL you like $519 still?
"When NFLX was twice the size of Disney I remember reading that one day, I bought Disney stock around $100 & shorted NFLX around $600. Well now DIS is twice as big as NFLX. I saw/read the same thing about INTC and NVDA, NVDA was like $600 and INTC was like $40, so I loaded up on INTC and shorted NVDA around $600 7 months ago, now look, almost even INTC is $60+ never goes down ever at all time highs and NVDA hasn’t had an uptick since."
Gap at $504 to be filled after earnings. Ask the bag  holders of AMD INTC & QCOM how the 15% drops felt after earnings never to recover.
"NVIDIA not getting hit as hard as a lot of the big growth stocks. Because it actually has a pretty decent valuation at these levels. 3 quality growth stocks, with good valuations for this rough market:https://youtu.be/SMQcHMZBaU8"
Hows that ER and those bogus upgrades feeling now?
I have to say that 4% loss today hurts in short run...tsla almost lost 9% today and 28% low from it all time high...at this point I have started adding to tsla and nvda....I see green for remaining 4 days
Its the 42 TFLOPS that is taking this stock down. I've been telling you all for a long long time.
"NVDA is the future. Ignore that fact if you like, but if you do you'll be the one explaining to your children why you can't afford to send them to college."
Just took a screen  shot  of NVDA only down 0.67. Won’t ever see it down only that much ever again.
Almost at selling point.
"Better chance of me making love, from behind, to Lynda Carter, Farah Fawcett, Heather Thomas, Heather Locklear, Jaclyn Smith & Pamela Anderson, in their primes, than NVDA ever going green again, ever!"
this board is pretty quiet.....come on we need more noise. more cowbell.
This thing is hot.
$600 is inevitable! So close we long can feel it within arm reach.
Shorting 585 weekly here at $22.65. It’s a must see.
"I like $ATKR, as an electrician for forty years they have all the pipe, fittings, and unistrut I used. Sells at a reasonable PE of 16.76 and seems set for the rotation away from tech. Bought on 12/15/20, up 27% in 2 months"
$600 came earlier than expected. Do we get another $50 rise next week. Earnings 2/24 how high will NVDA go?

Morgan Stanley just said NVDA should report strong results.
ANOTHER GIFT! GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY. ADD SHARES HEREDOLLAR COST AVERAGE INALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN.CHOO CHOO!
NVDA gives up 3 days worth of gains and you people act like its the end of the world. Chill out and enjoy the ride. Once they close the purchase of Arm they will be the only AI company. I have been in NVDA since 19/share. Every stwp of the way people sounded just like today.

Now the stock is really moving....up over 2%....now 2.54%
"Watch TXN, Texas Instruments earnings next week. Very big in the auto market. If they beat and increase estimates, NVDA will fly to 52 week high. Same with LRCX."

New tech will continue to go up no matter what. Nvidia is one of 'm (AD/EV/AI/VR/gaming/mining/data centers/ARM). Diversified but this is still my largest holding. Needham is spot on.

"So Intel is the place to be right now? Huh? What? Forget about that! Intel is still a huge mess - and the new CEO has not even started yet. The turn-around will take years. If it is even do-able. Taiwan Semi said yesterday that’s business is booming. All is great in semi-land. 5G products are booming. Remember to get the 5G top 3; Marvell, Qorvo, Skyworks.Nvidia is still king. Nvidia is doing deals left and right. Automotive wil be huge. We are on our way to one trillion dollars."

How many people sold the weekly 600 calls the other day for $25?
Told you to sell at $590. That's what I did.
Almost 600! That’s awesome! I bought in at 139 as a F it moment and held through all the dips and of course will hold long as hell!
"Growth tech names like $ZM $TSLA $SNAP $PINS $SFIX $TWLO $NVDA $TWTR etc. selling off for a simple reason. Powell saying that when the economy returns to normal so will inflation. This leads to strong fundamentals growth (booming economy) but rising rate environment. Rising rates hit DCF discount rates on growth stocks (all of the aforementioned names have huge multiples). This means the highest multiple stocks start coming back to reality. I've been rolling back into my highest conviction names. As fundamentals show their strength, the market will likely get over the temporary valuation correction and re-rate growth names higher. I'm not going long value tech ($INTC or $FB or $AAPL), I'm going to stick to what works. Long $PINS and $SNAP more specifically."
I see $299 next week at some point where I cover and go long swear
I hope we'll get a red day tomorrow. Dow and Nasdaq need to retest March lows

@SalamanderJohnson don't run away when NVDA doesn't fall $50 today as you predicted. stay right here
Begging  pleading  with you all to sell and short NVDA over 490 it’s your last chance ever after tomorrow employment numbers (But hey men can play women’s sports & Dr Suess is cancelled.)
What a great day. Weak hands shaken out and suicide shorts who are future buyers.Funny how there is a hearing when a few retail-investors play with gamestop but NOTHING will happen when the white colour criminals on Wall Street act like today.

NVDA train. let's go.
"The safe buy zone starts at 587 and extends up 5% must hit with big volume, let’s see what happens"

I'm being a little sarcastic; but I'm starting to think NVDA will increase 100% once the ARM deal is completed; going from 3 to 600.

BUY NVIDIA NOW!BUY AND HOLD LONGTERM!
Jen will have something up his sleeve tonight. We know he cares about those who invest in nvidia. There are quite a few options. You better not be short. Even banjo and kylie aren't fyi.

"Nvidia, should Go green tomorrow￼."
NVDA in one week $615 to $495That’s $120 or 20%No wonder HUANG sold $1b in stock $550
"Great numbers Nvidia, well done!"
mistery solved; kylie sold at 555...and the longs are to blame of course. We should have sold as well. Or: how 12 year olds think. Oh well. He'll grow up eventually. Or not.

NVDA falls below $500 I make half a million on my weekly NVDA put options so no one buy
No one here can handle the truth: NVDA $25 just five years ago.

This will spike 15 to 25% higher in one day once the UK unleashes its statement that it has no problems with the ARM takeover. If you're short you need to know. Anyways I'm putting my cash to work on days like these.
@LarryTheLegend didn't you predict NVDA $570 today?
Now in a low volume 'handle' setup into earnings next week. I consider that a bullish omen.

You can be long and short in a stock and make money doing both. Some rewards are instant and some are down the road. The whole trader vs investor mentality.
VIPUL is a good trader. Sold $555 and hasn’t had an uptick since. You all laughed at him. I applauded him. Only fell $18 intraday and the market is still up!
Where is the bearish  Kevin? He’s always right. I came in here about to buy last August @ $589 but didn’t because he said gap @ $504. He saved me millions. Thank you “bad” Kevin.

A few million years ago there was a company called 3dfx interactive. They ruled everything in 3D visuals. Nvidia took them out.Recently Nvidia wanted to buy a company called Mellanox. Everyone and their mother said the deal would never ever ever pass regulatory approval. Mellanox is Nvidia Networking now.Never ever ever EVER bet against Nvidia. Surely the deal will pass..!!!
"better cover now ,it's going up"
Closed lows of the day down $50 on 300% volume NVDA will never trade $500 again after tomorrow Short away
What's going on?
Currently ranked 4 (sell) on ZachAnother article says Nvda is not a buy right nowGet out now and try to get back in after a big drop of earning folks
No one  I repeat no one in the world  is holding any stocks into a weekend ever
I honestly can say with confidence that I don’t think  NVDA will ever trade higher ever again
Let’s play the newest game sweeping  the nation  called IMAGINE IF. Let’s imagine where NVDA would be if the NASDAQ weren’t up 5000 points since it hit $589 last August 2020
No stock falls $35 right before earnings if they are going to be good! Supply constraints again like last earnings! BTW $545 last blowout earnings $575 tomorrow am nice stock stock collapses after every earnings
I must say @Darth Trader really did predict this. he must be a god
Observation: profits will have doubled this may (12 months) and we're up less than 30% since then. I doubt this will fall much further. On the contrary. Screaming buy.
Decimated! All techs just horrendous. Techs definitely affecting my overall performance today.
$30 off the daily lows which means it will drop below that after earnings Sorry longs it’s reality Fell 615 to 535 right before earnings No way it’s going higher than 580
"hey all, I check in on this forum to check for news and updates on nvda price action and just want to thank everyone for contributing. I've been an nvda long for a while and will keep holding. for those of you who don't know I just found that u can mute people so for those of you that find that #$%$ that goes by the name legend annoying, you can mute him and you don't have to tolerate his #$%$ts."
Buy NVDA before too late & be regret loosing a chance to gain!! you will miss the boat when it take off big!! the
Mr. ‘.’ come enjoy the beautiful day!
Sub 500 before 10am is a lock  feel it in my loins 515 now let’s see
Bye  200 day moving average going to $299 in March
NVDA has to rise +$60 after earnings to break even from yesterday LOLLLLL
I am more confident if 463 from 540 then I was 504 at 614. And we all know how many times I called that. Sell inner loin 513 short 463 then 299
Futures going slowly into green (dow is already there). Looks like we're gonna have a normal trading day.
don't sell
WHAT TIME  $504? 9:30  am EST
The king of technology. Hail to the king
Making the call: NVDA will be down $50 today. Save this brilliance.
"1,000% gain on nvda 3/10 500c from 2 to 20 in a day and a halfboom"
BUY WITH BOTH HANDS THIS IS IN EVERYTHING. COMPUTERS EV CARS TELEVISIONS I PADS ANYTHING ELECTRIC. NVIDIA MOST LIKELY IN. Stay long they cannot even keep up with demand. Buy this and forget about it going to 750
NVDA $584 and crashing NVDA $589+ last AugustAny questions?
I sure would like to know what caused NVDA to jump 6% all of the sudden. It's not like this company doesnt have a positive rankings. We were getting choked @ $520 for over 6 months and now it's gonna move? What gives or is it astrological?
"All I require for my thesis to remain intact is for the 600Calls to continue to expire worthless. Today would make such action “more likely”Whatever the actual price is, it’s < 600."
NVDA has to have minimum +$40 day after earnings for longs to break even from 2 days ago
"600+ in after hours tomorrow on fantastic results, they still can't keep up with all the demand"
GME $350 up $100I don’t hear  anyone congratulating me for long GME $39 and short NVDA $614. Still haven’t covered one share of NVDA btw
"So Big Daddy, how many millions did you short at the close?"
"Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google etc.. Say NO ARM for Nvidia. The whole deal was to give Softbank $2B. Everyone knows the ARM deal won't go through. Too much at stake for many companies and countries."
Nvidia stock price target raised to $660 from $605 at J.P. MorganMentioned:NVDA
"NASDAQ kicking it into high gear, NVDA soon to follow! Shorts the door really closing fast now!!!"
$504 is coming there is a gap there sorry to say been telling you 1000x bag holders galore I feel bad for you novices
NVIDIA is down 5.46% to 484.25
lol look on pre market driving as hell again
where you at Legend????
"Chips shortage ? Buy the suppliers, AMAT, LRCX, ASML....they will benefit the most. I am long LRCX since 1990 and my quarterly dividends are more than my original investment. If ASML drops $20-30, I will buy and put is away."
it is a green day. we are going to recoup what we gave yesterday
Graphcore competition comeing to a town near you Huang! Your little pixel pushers won't stand against real AI hardware that was designed with AI in mind
NVDA could very easily fall $50 again today with some luck
"For all of you that want the ARM deal to go through, at the earliest it won't be until 2022. If you have stock at that time good luck because NVDA will be paying 38 billion in stock for the deal. Your valued stock will be so diluted, it will be significantly lower. After the accountants rebalance the books, NVDA will be force to be wrecken with. The ARM deal makes NVDA a monopoly on 1500 licenses and could charge whatever they want for services on chips. Just saying!"
There it is: 24 weeks straight the 600 call options expired used toilet  paper  with the stock in the 500’s the entire time. Almost  impossible yet #FACT
From 2.5% UP to 2.5% DOWN....Hmmmmm
"Hey shorts, take a gander at the scoreboard. You coulda, shoulda, woulda covered at $530. So tell us again, who are the greedy ones here today?"
"Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $575 at Piper Sandler Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $625 from $575 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. Nvidia reported strong January quarter results and April quarter guidance, Kumar tells investors in a research note. As we move from the January quarter to the April quarter, much of the sequential growth will likely be driven by gaming, with a moderate contribution from data center and other segment, says the analyst. ""Despite the cryptocurrency distraction, we believe the company is set up well for future growth in both gaming and data center,"" concludes Kumar"
Omg  just fell $4 in literally less than one second lol I have never seen that ever before in 30+ years of trading
"Can you believe QUALCOMM protesting NVidia purchase of ARM. It is ok if I do it, just don't want you to."
I THINK WE GOT A NVIDIA TRAIN!!!
red in a row
HOW ABOUT A NVIDIA ROCKET? SWEET BREAK OUT!IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. STOCKS BASE. STOCKS GET DRAGGED DOWN BY MARKET FORCES (CHINESE VIRUS) ALWAYS BUY GOOD COMPANIES ON PULLBACKS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND (REGULARLY) ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN. VERY SIMPLE AND EASY STRATEGY TO GET RICH. JUST TAKE A PORTION OF YOUR INCOME EVERY MONTH AND BUY SHARES.
$557+ to $530 and going A LOT lower! NVDA R.I.P.! VIPUL I would lower your buy from $519 to $460.
NVDA + $550 = Superman + Kryptonite I will be lowering the price now weekly since $564 will never ever ever be seen again
"NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. We’ve all been here 3x before, and guess where she went? Down the drain"
in a few months $520 will be dirty cheap
Not all Chip Shortages are the same.Shortage of passive component's will quickly lead to a glut of memory when end use devices can't be built. Witness $NVDA NIVIDA down $36 a share today.
JUST SAW  A HELP WANTED SIGN  DOWN AT THE LOCAL DUNKIN DONUTS  SAW CATHIE WOOD  APPLYING
"There is a v curve coming... 545 was a frequent bounce point, it won’t go there. Excellent numbers and upward guidance and consistency in beating the street = higher price. I’ll add to my holdings near the open."
LoL! bashers turn into spamming bots on rally days... lOl!
"https://fortune.com/2021/02/04/nvidia-arm-takeover-antitrust-regulators/""The regulatory process is proceeding as we had planned,"" an Nvidia spokesperson said Thursday. ""Every European Commission merger filing has a pre-notification period, which can last several months for a major transaction. We are confident that we will obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.""We fully understand that the relevant governments and regulators will review this transaction in detail, as they should, given the significance of the deal,"" Nvidia said."
Going to fill the gap at $504 by Friday.......
200 day moving average is now 490. Last March after fell under it went down 60%. That takes us to $250
These opening bell dives getting old yet?
Intel blew out their Data Centers growth numbers. That’s NVDA’s sweet spot and bodes well and confirms a coming massive ER 
600 today
"We’re up 17% YTD on the way to another 100%+ gain this year. A professional stock for the sophisticated, Effervescent, discerning modern day Investor. Hehe "
"...the company noted in its last 10-K filing that “as a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints.”...https://seekingalpha.com/article/4405320-nvidia-critical-time-approaches"
"this is easy a $800B company, early next year will be around $600B"
NVDA will fall between $20-$40 tomorrow. Save this post and please keep your hands on the wheel & trade accordingly
Earnlngs coming out on the 24th. Looks like a lot of FOMO amongst the big investors. Many big blocks trading on the ask side of the mkt.
"Going RED, Powell/Yellen bubble bursts. Oh No !"
"With digital currencies demand increasing and EV manufactures are seeing chip demand etc, where will Nvda be?It should head to 1000 soonGl"
"Bottom 's just IN, buy more and loading up more."
"The NASDAQ was down 50 and NVDA was $524, now NASDAQ is up 50 and NVDA is $519. Any questions? Asking for a friend"
China produces 25% of all cars sold worldwide and there are more drivers than gamers. I think we're underestimating the growth of nvidia in this segment. Check new contracts.
NVDA will close down under $450 this week! Short $545 and buy outs now
"I mention this before, the street is desperate to dump overhyped-overpriced NVDA at $480.51 or any price they can get......Last week the street was desperate to dumped on you retail investors $620, $610, $580, $550, $510, $500, $490"
Microsoft blows away Q2 expectations on cloud and personal computing strength....and up big AH....Patience longs...
$700 by ER ? Comments ? It has been flat for 6 months.
"As much volatility as today this winner is only slightly ahead of 10 day ave. volume. This illustrates that there were fewer sellers today when compared to high volatile ones. This should be a core holding in one's portfolio along with AMZN, MSFT, AVGO, and many other HIGH QUALITY tech stocks."
"From Motley Fool: In addition to strong gaming-related sales, higher sales of laptops and other mobile devices during the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to a chip shortage. This imbalance between soaring demand and limited supply is likely to help AMD and NVIDIA fetch relatively high prices for their chips, boosting their profit margins in the process. Today's gains, in turn, might be just the beginning of a larger rally in these semiconductor leaders' share prices."
Me thinks we’re looking at a Blowout Quarter and Stock Split. Jensen Huang is a real visionary and Maestro and thinks 4 moves ahead of anyone. Deservedly to be mentioned in the same breath as the Elite CEO’s. IMHO 
"Sold some in the AH and now have bought them back getting a $35 spread. Wait for the analysts. Should see many revisions upwards and with the government weighing in on technology importance, $615 high will be taken out soon. GL"
Guess someone decided that P/E matters now
I had to leave early this morning with the SNAZZY NAZZY up 200. Did it close up over 300? ROTFLMFAO 
buy today it's going up tomorrow
Just extended my stay by 3 weeks at the Breaker’s in Palm Beach  @ $2500 a night. 
NVDA will be down $50 tomorrow on the AMD news. Please trade accordingly
Entire NASDAQ reversal pretty impressive! This whole thing over the 10 year is crazy!
"Waiting for tomorrow to take a deep ocean dive. Loading up @ 450, 400, 300"
"Tomorrow, it's heading for 580. I see 540 before earnings."
"Cathie Wood is begging for mercy. look at NVDA, TSLA, PLTR....she is done."
Nice rebound.
If NVDA doesn’t hold her 200 @ $490 it will go to $299 next week
This is like a great price to buy at.
"Bull case: Nvidia has partnered with over 370 Tier 1 Automotive suppliers, researchers and automakers including Mercedes-Benz, Nio, Toyota, Hyundai, VW, Volvo and Audi. They have acquired Mellanox and developed the DGX A100 for datacenter that has reduced the costs for major cloud companies by 1/10th while running at 1/20th the power with partners including Microsoft, VMware and Redhat. The Mellanox deal has also allowed Nvidia to offer Cyber Security Solutions and expand their datacenter marketshare. Nvidia has announced over 70 gaming laptops that will use their RTX GPU's in 2021 alone with their RTX 3090 being the most powerful consumer GPU on the planet (the A100 being the most powerful DPU on the planet). Nvidia is attempting to close the deal with ARM that will effectively allow them to ditch AMD and produce their own CPU's for self driving, datacenter, compute and mobile. The deal would bring in some of the most intelligent semiconductor architecture designers on the planet that helped Apple become what it is today back in the Acorn Computers days. Nvidia GPUs are included in 8 of the 10 fastest industrial supercomputers in the world, which speaks to the abilities of Nvidia engineers if the ARM deal falls through. Nvidia is in the Nintendo Switch that sold over 3.3 million units worldwide in the first 11 weeks. Demand due to Covid and the emergence of AI has created the best environment for GPUs on record with the demand to continue for the foreseeable future with supply struggling to keep pace.Bear case: No one in the future is going to drive, use the internet or game because everyone will become Amish. AI doesn't exist and won't transform the way we live. And I wasn't smart enough to buy years ago, so now I go around yahoo message boards to take out my anger on those who were smart enough to buy. Any questions?"
"I hope this thing slivers here just under 500 for a couple hours, resetting the intraday RSI, then breaks out over 500 and has an hour long short squeeze into the close."
$600 and counting!
GREAT DAY TO BUY THE DIP!WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!CONGRATULATIONS!KEEP DOLLAR COST AVERAGING IN!
You all own a stock down $100 in a week on incredible spectacular earnings. Think  about that for a second
"nvda a $1000 stock, gaming, crypto, cloud, on prem data centers, EV industry, 5G wieless...."
NVDA $615 to $483 without one uptick! Do you realize the millions you could have made with put options this week? My $540 puts I bought for pennies are $60+
look on tesla lol from 900 to 600
"TA is useless with a stock like this...we had several ""buy points"" at 550's , multiple times during several weeks/months ago ago and then it fell to 510's various times. I guess it works the other way too."
Not one chip company has traded higher after earnings! 0-100!
https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-gtx-1050-ti-graphics-card-2021/
"Why do IBD article have questions and NOT answers ?? IBD article headline always start with question "" Is Nvidia Stock A Buy After Steep Decline, Tech Sell-Off?"" I thought they are suppose to tell or suggest. Are they thinking RETAIL investors are the experts?"
"Najarian on CNBC sez -On CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" the investment committee gave their final trades.Market Rebellion Co-Founder Jon Najarian likes NVIDIA Corporation"
You all like this stonk NVDA @ $470? So over priced. Not even close to a bottom. I will let you all know when to cover & go long.
"Hey  longs, I mean “wrongs”, the market could go to 100.000 and NVDA still wouldn’t hit $589 again"
I am bullish
Gotta love buying these blue chips. Beginning of the year I bought aapl. That went in the crapper. Then I thought NVDA will be a safe play and now this. Wow!!!!
"Li Bin is smart, he knows that NIO doesn't need to be the master of everything and can utilise partnerships with amazing companies like $NVDA and $SNP. The earnings call tonight should be interesting."
"beating by this much, we should see a 10% pop tomorrow, just like what GOOG did."
WE NEED A NVIDIA ROCKET!
615 to 483 in a week and longs are proverbial “creaming in their pants” because NVDA is up $1
10:27am ET was the correct answer to WHAT TIME BLOOD  RED. Congratulations  to all who played this Monday morning. Imagine if NASDAQ weren’t up 200
what happened to after hour trading?
So who bought at $615?
$504 or bust! Just wait until earnings will make Tesla look like it’s going up
smart $$$ accumulating here
"Not to worry...as usual in past many e/r quarters, short sellers tried to get out of the wood as they know NVDA will be for sure UP HUGE tomorrow morning as it TOP beats estimate today on both REVENUE and EPS with GREAT GUIDANCE for fiscal 2022 quarters....No wonder when it SHOULD BE up at least 10% or higher tomorrow at opening market where millions of traders get in ...."
"Had to mute Kevin, he's what we used to call in the 60s, a Head Jammer!"
"From Tom's Hardware: Jensen Huang's answer came during a Q&A with the press to cover the company's GTC announcements. Still, as expected, the topic of the ongoing shortages of GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 models bubbled up during the session. In response to a question about the shortages, Huang countered that the company hadn't experienced a shortage of supply, but rather an abundance of demand:""The 3080 and 3090 have a demand issue, not a supply issue,"" said Huang. ""The demand issue is that it is much much greater than we expected — and we expected really a lot.""""Retailers will tell you they haven't seen a phenomenon like this in over a decade of computing. It hearkens back to the old days of Windows 95 and Pentium when people were just out of their minds to buy this stuff. So this is a phenomenon like we've not seen in a long time, and we just weren't prepared for it.""""Even if we knew about all the demand, I don't think it's possible to have ramped that fast. We're ramping really, really hard. Yields are great, the product's shipping fantastically, it's just getting sold out instantly,"" said Huang. ""I appreciate it very much, I just don't think there's a real problem to solve. It's a phenomenon to observe. It's just a phenomenon."""
"nvda 3/5 485c +1,800%friday is payday"
Today very low volume. That is a bullish setup.
That wasn't good.
The weekly 550 calls down 60% today LOL  when will you rookies ever learn?
Possibly the largest growth stock in the next decade with the most solid track record in tech and youre shorting when its low
"Don't worry Kevin, that 504 gap will be filled!!!"
"Never would have believed this stock would fall to bear territory (over 20%) from its high just a few weeks ago AND after that fantastic earnings report. Everyone just wants those energy stocks. It's crazy. But it's the market. Not selling this stock nor other great ones like AMZN and AVGO. All clobbered, however. Even some 'non techs'. Not on margin and have no debts so I will just take it on the 'cheek' for now. Things will get rational again. Congrats to those playing energy. Have a winning hand for now."
5B vs expec 4.81. top to bottom beat.
"$540....$555 sale order will be filled soon, I may have to change it to $575."
"Down $100 in 2 weeks. Yep, everyone saw that coming. lol Haven’t sold a share and wish I had more cash to add here."
Anyone make 500% on the weekly 520 puts on my “feel it in my loins” posts to short $535 late yesterday?
"Bought 530 puts as a joke just 10k worth for .50 sold 7.50 lol $150,000 cleared lol "
Bye  Bye  NVDA $500 forever. Now we can get to $299 where I promise I will cover & go long. Will be there by tax day
Here's Huang as a young fellow...
$605 high to $573 low so far. That's $32 . We are not done yet. NAZ may be down 500 points today. I warned you about 10 year yield and NAZ last week.
Good day for chip lovers! Nvidia about to break $600 and AMD approaching $100!! Love em both!
NVDA will be down $10+ at one point tomorrow or I never post again
NVDA just fell $10 in literally one second pre market going to 450 today
GREAT DAY TO BUY SOME STOCKS WHEN THE MARKETS ARE DOWN!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN.!
"Just initiated a position in NVDA! Great quarter and great guidance, way above consensus estimates!"
Freedom - please advise your On Campus update?Kevin is skeptical you have a friend and visited anywhere other than the Bunny slopes. :-)
Dear lord what a heavenly dip
"I told you weeks ago overhyped Nvidia was not worth $610-$620. Today the street is desperate to sell you NVDA at $495.76, I'm sure they want to buy undervalued AMD ................."
Just bought more. Yo guys I am going to be rich! Very rich soon. Thanko
WHAT TIME?
Stop the bleeding already
September Intel announces new design chiplet Xe at 42 TFLOPS. Ever since then Nvidia has stayed flat or has gone down.Not a coincidence. Nvida chip is a HUGE MONOLITH dinasaur no future for it. Intel Xe is the future.
BUY NVIDIA THE STOCK WILL BE $700+ VERY SOON.
"Seriously, does anyone here have some sort of idea of what's causing the run-up?"
"“Autonomy and electrification are the key forces transforming the automotive industry,” said Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO. “We are delighted to partner with NIO, a leader in the new energy vehicle revolution—leveraging the power of AI to create the software-defined EV fleets of the future.”“The cooperation of NIO and NVIDIA will accelerate the development of autonomous driving on smart vehicles. NIO’s in-house developed autonomous driving algorithms will be running on four industry-leading NVIDIA Orin processors, delivering an unprecedented 1000+ TOPS in production cars,” said William Li, Founder, Chairman and CEO of NIO.$NVDA $NIO"
Got my $499. Done for today. See you tomorrow. Taking dog out to Clearwater beach.
"I honestly believe that if NVDA hadn't announced the ARM deal the stock would be in the $600 to $650 range. It was a reach for the stars that has many investors worried. If the deal goes through NVDA then becomes an $800 stock almost overnight, but I worry what will happen if the deal doesn't go through. On another note I feel like the stock is being manipulated as didn't this ""investigation"" story come out several months ago and is just being replayed to keep the stock down."
3 huge selloffs and all before noon. Yup a really great stock
Anyone here also “feel it in their loins” yesterday @ 535+ when I shorted and bought weekly puts up 1000%
Breakout time.Check 1 year chart. Just in time. 700's by august is not too far fetched imo.
It takes a lot of time to count all of that coin...be patient.
To expensive. Will buy graphcore on day one and hd forever. NVidia has no meat left on the bone.
"Shorts in denial. What else is new. ""oh but we're not short, we're just concerned about you longs""....Okaaaaaay. Don't worry, we're doing very fine. Thank you very much."
rumors of fake interest rate hike today. buy the dip.
@TrapperKeeper12 hahaha lost all your life savings shorting NVDA. say hi to Larry for me
Kevin likes gaps so I'm sure he's expecting NVDA to fill the gap at $520 today.
$615 to $483 and can’t tick up a penny R.I.P. NVDA
"If this thing takes out Friday's low, I see nothing stopping it from going to $400 at least."
unbelievable
"Decent ER, but way too expensive. 6-7% growth Q/Q, plus about the same for next Q, ain't much to talk about. If long, maybe would not sell, but I ain't buying at these levels."
On to $700 after next ER 
Imagine if NVDA didn’t blow out earnings and up forward guidance huge?
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A NVIDIA ROCKET LAUNCH!TIME FOR LIFTOFF TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!WE ARE GO FOR LAUNCH!
"ARM, the best of British innovation + NVDA, the crown jewel of semiconductors = global domination."
625 tomorrow 
When NASDAQ fell 350 last week NVDA fell $50Weird it’s up 350 and down $5
"Ladies & Germ  infested TARDS, WHAT TIME RED? Since I began ripping NVDA on a daily basis back into August:NVDA $589 to $527SOXX up 30%NASDAQ up 40%Any questions to my strength?"
Boom!!!!!!
"The OPTIONS predicted this. There was no need to eat a book, or guess, or come in every day for 8 months and say the same thing and hope. I traded this up and down and told you buy long and sell short. 8 weeks ago, I ran the Options through the GJJ supercomputer and it said: All 600 calls will expire worthless, FOREVER. that of course means no Friday close will ever be above 600. You can manipulate all week, but by Friday, it’s going under 600. That prediction has held for every options expiry for 8 weeks and will continue to hold: Forever. I will advise if the prognosis of the GJJ supercomputer changes."
"Nasdaq will turn Green soon,"
I have been in and out of nvda for a few years now. Is my recollection correct that the stock price rises into earnings and then drops or sideways after?..... obviously in a perfect world it will be a nice steady climb
10% market correction is imminent. Trade with caution !
it's a no-brainer buying nvda sub 500 for true long-term investors
Wheres Kevin?!?! hahahaha
"Love how every long down $150 in 4 days somehow has more non stop funds to keep buying every $10 down $150! Liars! Doesn’t work that way. Margin dries up the more you lose and you get margin called! Someone like me, I am short with every penny to my name so my margin has quadrupled in a month so I just keep shorting with freed up cash"
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!NVIDIA LAUNCH!NEXT STOP $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS!
NVIDIA ROCKET TIME!GET IN NOW!NVIDIA WILL ROCKET TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!$1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS
of course i would by puts during a rally.
coddled chronics with the emotional development of 10 year olds
All time high
"Love all the initial headlines on earnings, ""NVDA explodes higher after Blow out Earnings"" , LOL"
If you longs want to invest in this stock you should start buying at $490/share and add a few shares after each $30 decline from there. Growth stocks are out of favor now. The money is piling into #$%$ with #$%$ poor balance sheets and slow growth.
let's go baby let's go
I see $532 soon  gap then $504 gap. Then RIP  for the remainder of 2021 back around $298 where I honestly will cover and go long with real TIGHT stop  losses obviously
"BA grounds all 777’s, engine bursts into flames and their up $10 BWAHAHAHA"
It's all just to screw the people trading options. Will drop down to $550 and then go up to $600 tomorrow. Just watch.
Tame CPI...NVDA train keeps moving today...sweet
We simply cannot catch a break in this market.
You all like the 550 560 570 580 590 600 all HUGE call options bought into earnings ALL near $0 by Friday. See how this game works? BTW NO put options bought.
Will be under $400 by Friday
look at GME LOLOLOL lets say thank you to NVDA!
I see now why they claim nvidia stumbled today. Crypto will not be a large part of the business
NVDA below the 200 day moving average finally. Going to $299 this month
"Record er but Down? Priced for perfection. All is priced in , it went up 300$ on covid allone. The future is digitalisation bit Nvidias run is over. They can't grow into this high price"
Top and bottom lines beat analysts expectations as did projections for the next quarter. Keep buying this dip!
My supercomputer sees 5% in the red today
10 year going back down to 1.50 by next Tuesday. NVDA to $550.
Should exceed above $615 by tomorrow to new RECORD HIGH....as good E/R today....
KEVIN REALLY SOUNDS DESPERATE how negative can he get.
Never bet against Cathy Wood! Hehe 
"funny how the shorts were bashing NVDA on Friday, now they are all hiding. glad to see they are gone!"
"thoughts on ARM acquisition? not liklihood or even how rich we'd get if it happens... im interested to hear if people think it would be good for the broader processor market. are we trading of efficiencies for innovation? will nvidia be a good overlord and continue to license? is it worth the risk? what's gained (not in share price, which would pass all Jupiter's moons)?"
Where's the kid Kevin? who doesn't have enough for 1 share NVIDIA
"I see the bulls are out grazing today. Dang, this bites."
Zzzzzeeeeeelllllll seeeellllll
Dayum. What happend here?
$466.72 next support then on $458.19
"For everyone waiting for a stock market crash, you realize we had one last year right?"

"As long as I keep hearing EVERYONE saying earnings will be INCREDIBLE AMAZING SPECTACULAR like FSLY & QCOM, and 100 price target increases, YET the stock hasn’t moved a penny in 6 months, I know this will be $504!!!!!!!!"
Dow up 600 on Friday and NVDA after falling $150 is up $4 LOL 
Anyone short 519 when I begged you to???
WHO ARE THE LUCKY INVESTORS BESIDES ME THAT BOUGHT NVIDIA TODAY? CONGRATULATIONS!!! FIRE SALE PRICES!I ADDED ANOTHER 500. I WILL CONTINUE MY DOLLAR COST AVERAGE PLAN AND BUY ANOTHER 500 IF THE NASDAQ SELL OFF CONTINUES.
I think  we hit $504 tomorrow. Decent quarter but disappointing to say the least! Remember $600 in after hours? LOL! Reminds me of FSLY @ $102 right to $59
Just fell $5 in one second new freshly baked lows of the day
Disappointed with action today. Wanted to see up over 30. Will have to wait till tomorrow. And so it goes!
Man those 600 calls going for $25 last week LOL  again that’s 27 consecutive weeks the 600s have expired worthless with the stock near 550 the entire time! Unheard of
"nasdaq underwhelming, nvidia still solid as a rock"
the answer is yes until you run out of gold fillings
"Nvidia is my largest holding and highest conviction long term pick. In at an average cost of $165, but I will never sell a share. I plan to hold well into the maturity of its' business and will be happy living off of their dividends 30, 40 or 50 years in the future. Invest long and prosper ."
Is it out yet?
"INTC's decision not to outsource their chip making has put names like AMD and NVDA in extremely fertile soil. Look for these two names to wake up from their slumber soon and take out 100 and 600 respectively. It's not a question of if they will do it but when. Patient longs will be rewarded, while the weak hands will be kicking themselves for selling out before the miracle happens. Bottomline, as long as Jensen Huang and Lisa Su are the captains, the sky is the limit. Shorts will be mutilated long term."
I think I saw $580.
3 months ago Intel market cap was half NVDA now look  even lol 
This stock is definitely undervalued. Big upside to be expected...
"CHOO-CHOO!.....Nvidia price target raised to $600 from $550 at Barclays 06:49 NVDA Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $600 from $550 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst increased price targets across the semiconductor capital equipment sector. While valuations ""definitely feel uncomfortable,"" the companies offer beat and raises across the board and good visibility into Q2 given shortages, Curtis tells investors in a research note."
Global Semiconductor Revenues Rebound in 2020: 5 WinnersOne of them is of course Nvidia
"N. Korea, Iran and China are using Nvidia cards to mine Bitcoin. BIG MONEY to be made with massive mining operations, as Bitcoin keeps going up."
"Where is Needhams Rajvinder Gill. Haven't heard from him for a while.. Common man, get up there and raise the price target from $800 to $900 or something."
NVDA is a stock for the next decade. Invest long and prosper.
For crying out loud. Everything keeps making new highs. NVDA sits here at 500 stuck.
$450 is next support Coming in February at the latest
"""Corsair beats estimates as consumers turn to gaming amid pandemic"".Nvidia will knock it out of the freaking park come earnings day. Nvidia is king. Nvidia to one trillion dollars and beyond!"
Nvidia is a chip dinosaur nearly extinct. Intel Xe with its sleek new chiplet design is the future of graphics and AI.
"Loving the highs and I'm a long but I don't think the blind optimism here about the price in the upcoming weeks is realistic. We know NVIDIA has supply chain issues and can't make their new cards in sufficient quantity, they've had to start releasing older model cards again to keep up with demand, and the ARM deal is far from a done deal. This evidence suggests that they're going to miss on earnings which in conjunction with the ARM deal woes means a substantial correction in the near future is likely."
No stock ever falls from 615 to 590 and lower right before great earnings
300s
"tech such as Nvidia has been a wonderful hedge during the pandemic. However vaccines are becoming more a more available as the pandemic winds down, funds are being shifted back into travel, industrials, utilities, and hospitality since these are beaten to low prices. Investors are looking into buying those low prices as many things including states are now starting to open up to 100%. I love Nvidia but I think if you look at the NASDAQ over the past 30 days it's obvious that these prices aren't coming back for quite awhile. They need to have some corrections before the price starts to grow again. GLTA "
"I have never held a stock in my life down $25 on no news, BUT I have been short plenty of them (NVDA)"
Anyone here old enough to remember $557? Going to $460
Waiting for the mad money video to show up....can't watch it in real time in Europe. But it's probably very interesting since pps went up ah.

"This is the reason you shouldn't day trade NVDA! Just buy, hold and get rich! The AI stock of the world!"
"Stonks that undercut their 200 day MA like NVDA did then rally back above, always go WAY lower. Remember kiddies, at $615 I told you gap $504, now I am warning  you about gap $463."
Anyone buy GME 348 to 172 bought more at 198 yes 
"Clorox wipes and NVDA chips, severe shortages, Clorox stock $239 in August to $179 now. Shortages are bad since sales are made 12 months in advance."
"NVDA was $589 @ NASDAQ 9000NVDA is $530 @ NASDAQ 13,300"
336 is bo parabolic point get long there
NVDA up $5 yesterday NASDAQ up 400 today down $20 NASDAQ down 200
"What a joke, it seems like every company that has a very good future like NVDA is getting slammed but companies with bad futures soar like GME. Hopefully things will return to normality soon, but who knows it seems we are entering bear market territory"
Why would anyone still be long NVDA $482 down from $615?
Market is on fire. Forest rakers are enjoying double triple overtime. But not for nvda. Your 600 calls are a transformer fire.
NVDA gap $463 has to be filled no matter what so don’t even bother being happy 
HAHAHA now the street wants to sell you overvalued NVDA at $497.16.
"Nvidia will close green so all you dysfunctional hacks can get back in your hole, and think of stupid things to say for tomorrow."

Nice closing.
"I think the Reddit traders will take this stock to $700 in a few days. Never stand in front of a mob, you could get stampeded."
nvda breaks out. It could go much high!!!
Nvda is making me a millionaire!
interesting how it pulled back a little bit
Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $575 at Piper Sandler 06:14
OMG  my weekly 540 puts are up 160% today wow 
People are posting wrong data here. Nvidia was never above $500 in last July. It crossed $500 in late August. Do research before you make any decisions
Who’s in at $540? Raise their hands 
"94 PE, Price to sales 35, ARM fiasco...oh no ! $575-580 close today and $500 after earnings. Nobody wants high PE tech stocks. My BIIB, MA, AXP are rocking today."
Everyone in here recall Kevin saying gap needs to be filled $504 when it was $614? And to buy GME after it fell from $500 to $39? Anyone make tens of millions like me?
I can’t even imagine being long NVDA now/impossible to even comprehend for me
"While a good deal of NVIDIA’s success in servers over the last decade has of course come from their proficient GPUs, as a business NVIDIA these days is much more than a fabless GPU designer. With more software engineers than hardware engineers on staff, it’s software and ecosystem plays that have really cemented NVIDIA’s position as the top GPU manufacturer, and created a larger market for their GPUs. At the same time, it’s these ecosystem plays that have allowed NVIDIA to build a profit-printing machine, diversifying beyond just GPU sales and moving into systems, software, support, and other avenues.To that end, NVIDIA this morning is formally rolling out a new ecosystem play aimed at high-end deep learning servers, which the company is branding as NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Soft-launched back in the fall, today the company is giving the program a more proper introduction, detailing the program and announcing some of the partners. Under NVIDIA’s plan, going forward customers can opt to buy NVIDIA-Certified systems if they want an extra guarantee on system performance and reliability, as well as opt in to buying support contracts to get access to direct, full-stack technical support from NVIDIA... https://www.anandtech.com/show/16452/nvidia-launches-server-certification-program-offering-direct-technical-support"
Know what I miss? The $400’s and NVDA. Well you won’t be missing it anymore
I notice no one is making fun of my GME now $39 to $200 in a week or my NVDA short $615 to $450 in two weeks
$545...Give me $555 today or I hold out till $575 next week.
"The “overhead” pressure now on NVDA after falling from 615 to 515 in a week, anyone sell yesterday at 557?"
"Anyone “screen shot”  $500? I did, if anyone wants I can send them a copy. Who would have ever thought  NVDA could be $500? Unless of course you bought $589 last July or $615 two weeks ago "
Let’s try something new today: WHAT TIME  RED? (A) 9:30  am EST(B) 9:31am EST(C) 9:32am EST(D) 9:33am EST

"If you don't own amc you really don't like money, only 2M shortable shares available, gama and short squeeze coming, undelivered shares are still to be bought. Going to be massive."
NVDA is a chip stock. Chip stocks are boom/bust cyclical in nature. QCOM INTC AMD the 3 other fabless chip companies all fell 20% after earnings. That’s $120 in NVDA to the downside testing “her” 200 day MA.
the words are mixed up actually he means he has short loins and everything else that goes with that
spy instant pullback from 1st test of 50% retrace levelwas expectedshallow pullback is fine a collapse is not

Was a great day. I’ll give ya that. History will repeat itself. I’m banking on it. So there it is.
I LOVE NVIDIA!!!! I BOUGHT MY FIRST 1000 SHARE BLOCK IN 2011. IT WENT DOWN AND I BOUGHT 2000 MORE AT $11/12. NOW I OWN 5500 SHARES TOTAL!I HAVE YET TO SELL A SINGLE SHARE!
Am I a genius selling yesterday at $499 ? I am happy to trade $15 swing and at the end of the day 100% cash. I sleep well and don't have to watch futures at mid night.
"This has become the most predictable event in the history of man. I might just quit my job, liquidate all my assets, just so I can short the day after earnings. and then buy 1 day later. One could simply retire doing this strategy for NVDA stock. LMAO"
"This is how the stock market SHOULD be run.1. No shorting -- if you don't believe in a company don't buy their stock.2. No day traders -- if you purchase a stock you must hold it for 5 days before you can sell it.3. No algorithms -- If these giant company's want to sell stock then hire more people to buy and sell.Okay, I feel better now....."
Will be down $50 tomorrow minimum save this brilliance NVDA R.I.P. it’s all about GME
NVDA will never see $500+ ever again after today save this post
How's that 600$ price tag???
S&P hits 4K will be the start of another big correction.asset bubbles abound
CONGRATULATIONS NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS! BUY AND HOLD LONGTERM!
Was that $502 a real or fake trade? $299 by next week
Let’s all get together and embrace hold hands  and tell KEVIN he’s a genius $504
Down $15 from highs we have all seen this pattern before tomorrow is sub $130 and Friday sub $120. Good luck to all
"so, concerning the semiconductor shortage... will NVIDIA be able to have 50% more product to sell a year from now? the demand will be there, but how about the semis?"
NVDA will settle around $299 next week. Save this post
fed got our back with unlimited fake money!!! I shall not be moved
"Sell Nvidia, no one needs their GPUs. Oh wait...hold on let me just finish this game."
The FED did its part yesterday! NVDA’s been clear for launch!
Gaps 532 & 504 upward gaps always fill Downward gaps never do 580
All posts mentioning huang and yahoo deletes. I wonder why?
thanks for the discount. just bought 5 more shares...
May have sold my $390.00 puts to soon
UNFORTUNATELY the high-PE growth stock trade is DEAD... NVDA's going back down to $460./share and staying around there for a while. Sorry bulls.
let's go baby let's go to 700$
"interesting eh? We'll see....""An indicator that has been historically accurate in marking a bottom in the stock market flashed again this week for the fourth time since 2012, according to a Thursday note from Fundstrat's Tom Lee.Volatility in the stock market spiked as a rapid rise in interest rates derailed high growth stocks. The Nasdaq 100 is off 7% from its February 16 high, while the S&P 500 is down 3% over that same time period.The 10-year US Treasury note spiked to a cycle high of more than 1.50% on Thursday, and interest rate volatility saw its biggest spike since March of 2020, as measured by the CBOE Interest Rate Volatility Index.But according to Lee, the volatility in interest rates feels ""capitulatory,"" which could lead to gains ahead for stocks.Lee highlighted that soaring interest rate volatility, coupled with an extended 30-week rate of change, occured on the following dates: June 24, 2013, October 15, 2014, March 19, 2020, and February 24, 2021.What's significant about the first three of these dates is that after each of these instances it marked the bottom in the stock market ""to the day,"" Lee said.

"""freedom liked freedom's comment""how sad "
I bought some today
The mighty Nvidia powers forward while the Nasdaq is weak today. Just another day in the world of Nvidia investor.
This is the week where I finally buy again at 504.
Nvidia chip is a huge dinosaur. Intel's Xe graphics chip is brand new design using chiplets. Enough said.
CNBC is playing this stock down before earnings. Which means they are drawing in the shorts. Get ready for a short squeeze AH. Lift off BABY.
Hold NVDA for the next decade and grow very rich.
Unlike like the massive fall from $292—> 135this next annihilation will dwarf that. $615—-> 380
Super beat... see you at 650s
Disclosure: $525 short was largest in a long time R.I.P. NVDA
"Didn't get NVDA at $505 but added LRCX at $505 this morning, my largest holding since 1990."
I am begging  you all sell $559 here NVDA will never ever be this high again ever!
"Skyworks knocked it out of the park with earnings! Marvell, Qorvo, Skyworks on fire!Nvidia is king. All hail the king."
"Had to walk away for an hour is NVDA still $519? Funny thing is that when it went from $615 to $463, there wasn’t one uptick, now still down $110 it only down ticks"
The open interest is weighted far too heavily on just out of the money calls - we're probably stuck here in the short term until those get flushed out.
I suggest you all watch the show Billions on ShowTime if you want to see what we are all about here at my firm
"NVDA bagdolders conference scheduled For Feb 25, pls bring your own chair and coffee."
I’m guessing people like darth trader and Kevin are loser day traders that beat their meat to 1% daily changes?
"Be honest longs, did you ever in your wildest dream, back in August 2020 at $589 think you would be sitting  with NVDA @ $519 seven months later and the Dow near 33,000"
"in two years, intc has gone from 52 to 58, peaked at 69nvda has gone from 150 to 490, peaked at 615"
Note  to all NVDA longs: There are openings at Dollar  General Wendy’s McDonalds Trader Joe’s WalMart Dunkins & Target 
This stock is ready to pop like an oversized Zit. 
"Hey  longs, so it’s down $70 this week into earnings, which means instead of dropping $200 on Wednesday night, it will only go down $130. It’s actually better."
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE!LIFE IS GOOD MY FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS LIFE IS GOOD!TODAY IS A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE INACCUMULATE SHARES. BUY AND HOLD FOR THE LONGTERM NVIDIA $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS

Wow  NVDA was just +$10 now dropping like a rock  literally fell $10+ in one second! Did they warn?
"""NVIDIA on Tuesday announced more than 70 new laptops will feature GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop GPUs and unveiled the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card for desktops.""70 new laptops with GeForce RTX 30 Series Laptop GPUs! 70! SEVENTY!!"
"Back in for $40,000. Let’s see if the week leading up to earnings will be good :) I always wanted a long term position in nvda. Hopefully this will be it."
Remember there is a great shortage of chips. Even the private sector is asking the government to help set up new facilities to expand production. WOW! Even the Biden administration having mentioned a chip shortage . Great sector to invest. Buy individual companies or buy FSELX Fidelity semiconductor sector. Other family of funds may also offer similar products
What are we looking at pps with this chip shortage? Btw been in NVDA since $85 other than Apple my largest holding!

Ladies & Germs  boys & girls what time red? Gap 504 & 532 need filling. NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite. Asking for a friend. WHAT TIME RED 
Nice to see weak hands shaken out before ER... LOL
this is one of the few stocks I hate cause I can never successfully trade it lol
Anyone buy GME @ $44 today? You all knew this was coming! $150 now going to $500
Relax folks - it can up and down in the short term... But $700 by next ER is my guess. Best.
"Somewhere between 700 and 800 this time next year, whether arm buyout clears or not. So why should I panic? Got more cash to add if necessary."
Wanted to sell partial when hit 300% return but now I’m long term greedy
Stock has been trading sideways for such a long time. When will it start to pop up?
several seasoned traders/investors repeatedly stated the pullback sub 500 was a screaming buy opportunity
"Shorts in here acting like this isn't going to rebound. You forget Nvidia AI is the #1 for EVs, were in a chip shortage, and GPU's are sold out the second they're restocked. Enjoy your shorts while it lasts."

I am looking for 472 or lower.
I read 1000 posts last night: “NVDA will be up $650 tomorrow.” How’s that working for you at $550?
Not impressed; but better than down. The day that NVDA continues to go up while NASDAQ and DOW go down will be a good day for NVDA. Needs to stand on it's own two feet.
Why are we down today? Does the market not like better than expected earnings and bullish outlook?
Dropping like a prom dress  on a warm  summer eve

"Nvidia price target raised to $700 from $600 at Raymond James Raymond James analyst Chris Caso raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $700 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares following January quarter results. Nvidia's report was ""strong,"" guiding revenue 18% ahead of consensus for Q1 mainly led by Gaming, but with all segments ahead of expectations, Caso tells investors in a research note. While crypto will be a concern given the unsustainable crypto revenue back in 2018, Caso says the company appears to be taking steps to minimize that as a percent of revenue, and the gaming market is clearly much stronger than the 2018 cycle."
MU & WDC two memory chip makers have doubled while NVDA hasn’t moved in 6 months 
Last NVDA earnings $540 blowout earnings upped guidance “running on all cylinders” right to $510
"Put a 6 month chart of chip maker MU over NVDA: one was $45 now $100, one was $589 now $548! YOU CHOSE POORLY"
Zero percent chance NVDA closes above $600. Less than zero. Short accordingly
Cathie Wood keeps buying this one every single trading day since Dec 2020. Stay long and strong NVDA!
NVDA should do a 4 to 1 stock split. Targets of 800 bucks and great quarters. Projected of 5 billion profit in a quarter.. this stock should take off soon.
Didn’t anyone see INTC AMD & QCOM after their supply constraint earnings? All down 15-20%. That would be down $110!

For crying out loud.
Here comes Kevin’s next imaginary Short at $593.65!

NVDA will never ever see $500+ after today ever. I honestly think  it goes to $300 by next week!
Give back $15 pleaseeeeeee
"Just buy some GME here with me, I guarantee you won’t lose. It’s exactly $100 right now. Zero risk"
"$463 $463 $463 is a lock. 100%. When NVDA was $614 I called for $504 at least 1000x. Everyone laughed at me. Price targets all $800. Yet when it hit $504 to $463, not one person said I was right. Here at my inner loin $513 it will be $463 soon and no one will say I was right."
Are u joking right now
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!DON'T BE LEFT BEHIND!CHOO CHOO!
"Kevin, Trapper Keeper, and the 2 dozen larry's are all paid hedge fund schills! The short ratio on this stock is huge right now and the broader market is not playing along with their plans to short this to the ground. Tepper ended this rotation out this morning and the 10 year yiled will not go over 1.60. Today is their make or break day. Do not sell your shares to them and buy more if you can. If you are long put in a sale price 100 points higher so they cannot short or borrow your shares. This thing could trade up like GME if you are smart and resist that is why they are on here 24/7."

"This stock traded SO obvious. Didn’t move for 7 months then suddenly goes from 515 to 615 fake breakout all the weak shorts panic and cover, the longs get giddy and think  it’s going to $700, and bam  one week later $450, so all the weak shorts lost and all the bag holding longs are stuck"
The common theme. DAYS LOWS. Better buy more jagoffs
NVDA will open under $500 tomorrow fill the 504 gap then head to 488! It’s going to get really ugly quick
I think Cramer needs to retire before he costs more people their hard earned money.
I love being on a galloping horse 
Anyone in here old enough to remember +$5 yesterday with the NASDAQ up 400? POOF all gone goodbye 
NVDA will never ever see $500 again after this week
"Pathetic performance by this stock at the end of the day. There is a very motivated group of sellers or no buyers. Either way, concerning. Should have been an up $15-20 day."
"the main reason for the chip shortage, per this analyst, is ""the breadth of demand""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lNxjwStoUU"
This is a perfect opportunity to buy on a dip just before another blow out earnings report. These are the types of situations I patiently wait for to add to my positions.
Anything under $600 is a steal. Buy with both hands. $1200 by EOY. 
#FACTSNVDA $589 August 20206 months laterNVDA $588NASDAQ +5000 since August Any questions? Asking for a friend
Split!!!!!
NVDA back to the exact penny it was 7 months ago. Good luck  to all longs!
I STARTED BUYING NVIDIA IN 2011 @ $25. BOUGHT 1000 SHARES. IT WENT DOWN. MORE THAN CUT IN HALF. I BOUGHT 2000 MORE AT $11/12. LAST TIME I BOUGHT WAS MARCH LOWS $185 NOW I OWN 5500 SHARES. SO HAPPY! WE LOVE CEO JENSEN!
"All the CEO does is sell stock and use the stock to buy other overpriced companies like Melllanox & ARM, which keeps growth up, UNTIL it doesn’t"
$518 is the highest NVDA will ever trade again in its existence
With the chip shortage I can see us going to $1000 and if we get Arm Holdings $2000. I owned Arm Holdings for several years before SoftBank bought them. It is an incredible company and has the licensing for 95% of the chips in use today. The “N in FAANG would change to NVDA no joke. 
NVDA 650+ next week on great earnings and revenues.
might close at $600. let's hope so!
Best day to short is Friday!!! 99% RED
fortunately I took profits before ER. just wait a couple of days and buy back in
NVDA starting climb to $699/share
Next week Google and Amazon earnings. We are going to fly.
"Why is this down 2.5% for no reason, all because of opposition for the ARM deal?"
"it's all about entries/exitslike when i pounded the table at march 20 covid lows saying to buy with both fists for long-term buy n hold entries, nvda was top pickand i got large block of nvda at 185posted at at the time too"
"Maybe big players are worried about a chip supply shortage? but this should not hurt Nvidia but instead the end products - smartphones, cars and TVs."
Why is Nvidia dropping so hard?
"If you sold the NVDA 600 calls, like I have, every week of every month since August, you would have made 2400% on your money "
#FACTS: NVDA $589 to $598 since last August
3 mo return: Naz +11% S|-|ITVIDIA -7%. What a great stock.
Anyone like my gap fill calls at $504? Anyone going to say I was right?
"I AM GOING TO BUY ANOTHER 500 SHARES OF NVIDIA. I WANT 10,000 SHARES AND ONCE I GET 10,000 SHARES I WILL GO AFTER 12,000, THEN 15,000, THEN 20,000! I LOVE REAL ESTATE!!!!! THE INCOME STREAM IS INCREDIBLE. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OFFICE BUILDINGS, SHOPPING CENTERS, APARTMENT BUILDINGS, THE RENTAL INCOME IS FANTASTIC. THEN THERE IS THE DEPRCIATION AND TAX WRITE OFFS! LIFE IS GOOD MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!! LIFE IS GOOD!!!!BUY TECHNOLOGY STOCKS!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!"
"Everyone is saying chip shortage, suddenly. Its not as if the car industry is booming or something because of covid. So they want to get the Reddit traders to SQUEEZE the shorts in chip stocks like Nvidia.The next few days is gonna be interesting."

Anyone like $589 last July or $500 now? Anyone like $615 ten days ago or $463 yesterday. You all know the $463 gap will definitely be filled
NVDA is going to $463 by today actually just watch this anyone want to bet me??? Any amount.

Raise your hand if you bought 593+?
Is it time to buy?
New equation for the rookies:NVDA + $500 = Superman + Kryptonite since we won’t ever see $564 ever again in our lifetimes
NVDA may be a decent company BUT an awful  stock
"Go ahead TK12, SAY IT "
SO MANY UPGRADES TODAY....I 'M LONG so HOLDING 's good way to do ...will get pay off as soon as later today and more tomorrow....but I don't care as holding for months / years....

"Given all the good news with EV adoption of NVDA chips, Nvidia probably should consider a 1 to 4 split. This bodes well for Apple and Tesla. Tesla might have to do another split soon."
Interesting on how all the resident reprobate Bash-Boys come out and rejoice at a down opening after moving over $600. They are still pouting that they didn't buy any Nvidia. The fun will soon be over as it turns green.
Nvidia data center biz slowed because of Intel Xe-SG1 streaming graphics chips. Figure it out.
"LRCX, NVDA $600 soon, AVGO $500. Blue horse shoe loves OPEN and LMND today."
If you saw the chart for AMD and QCOM. This drop is not surprised at all. Long term bullish.

NVDA $614 best of breed with blowout earnings...markets throwing out baby with the bath water. Buying the dip. Good Luck.
"Q1 earnings estimates will need to be raised. Colette's high end calculates to $3.37 per share while yahoo's average estimate is $2.55, hell even the high estimate is only $2.85"
$504 & $532 gaps need a filling. Where is guy who bet me at $557 NVDA would hit $560 before $504? What a rookie. Big AMD day tomorrow “Nvidia killer day.”

Nvidia price target raised to $665 from $600 at Cowen Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $665 from $600 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares.

He noted demand remains well above supply for both gaming products and datacenter chips.

Getting huanged AGAIN
Cathy Wood sprinkled fairy dust on NVDA and this monster acting accordingly. This will be a $1000 stock in 2022 IMHO 
Don't worry shorty I will let you buy to cover one third of my shares at 648 in the after hours
"The decline in Nvidia is just starting. ARM deal will get called off soon. China will never approve the deal. Get out and run. Save whatever crumbs you can this stock is house of ""cards"". -_-"

Weak hands being shook.... same old same old.
Yesterday's lost recovered. Now in coming 3 days 10-15% more gain!! Nvidia is the real deal!!! Bull all over nasdaq.
I remember $535 before two blowout earnings reports 6 months ago. What happens when they miss and warn???
Two earnings reports ago NVDA was $545 Two huge blowout quarters Stock is $548 LOL  Know what that means? The chip cycle is coming to an end

LOOKING GOOD
"Hey guys Just my thoughts but this stock will not reach your hopes and dreams until Arm gets out of the way. Company not giving shareholders a dime. Shorts own this stock. AMD longs same goes for you. Mergers and buyouts for longs must wait until the company wants you to move up. This game is rigged, I’ve gambled sports for 50 years and this stock market is the most corrupt event I’ve ever seen."
Another +100 NASDAQ Another NVDA upgradeAnother BLOOD  red day Any questions?
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA!WELCOME NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS WHO BOUGHT SOME SHARES YESTERDAY!IT WAS A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!ACCUMULATE SHARES DOLLAR COST AVERAGE INALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
"Kevin Sir, she is dropping her paaaaantiessss from $540! :-)"
620 by close today or Monday is my guess :-)
Down AH .... only because the hood traders are clueless hot money....GME is for them.
NVDA was twice market cap of INTC now almost even Why The f do I waste my breath in here and no one Listens
TIME TO BUY!NASDAQ SELLOFF A GIFT. GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY! TECHNOLOGY AND NASDAQ WILL REBOUND SOON ENOUGH. DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!!!!
"Too much drama on two companies that I just dropped.NVDA sounds stable, studied the company a lot, very impressive, moved my hard earned money into it.Happy sailing!!"
I will buy at 180
"My charts are for 472, and I am going to buy some at 336. Have seen this for so many years."
"Above 200 moving day average again. Hit yesterday and bounced. Went below today, but now had bounced above. If it closes above that number, that should be a very good sign."
Resusts are very good but current stock price is way ahead of its fundamentals so insiders are reaping profits by selling it now and wait to buy again when price will be around $500
Ascending pattern broken.
"Down ANOTHER $11 for no particular reason. Fear not, mega pumper Mario aka jagoff will add for the 621st time. Anyone else wondering why huangthecon hasn’t split this yet? If he did a slew of new investors would jump in and negate the volatile swings. Cant have that"
Bear market rallies including sector bear markets have sharp bounces during overall declining pattern. Get used to it and trade it.
QQQs up 5 points and this thing can't get above 500.
$552+ will never be seen ever again ever in our lifetimes; good luck and trade accordingly
THE MARGARITAS ARE FLOWING HERE IN LAS VEGAS!!!! PARTY TIME MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS! AND CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THE NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!! WELCOME TO THE NVIDIA FAMILY!

$640 AFTERHOURS!! 
NVDA trivia: Down tomorrow:(1) $50(2) $40(3) $30(4) $20
AMD and MSFT both reported great earnings. This bolds well for NVDA when it reports next month.
Jensen is really long winded. Just keeps talking. Boring CC. Destroying the stock after hours. Incredible plunge....like 40+ points from its high after hours. Never seen anything like it. Takes him 5+ minutes to answer simple question.
"Shorting the exact opening print tomorrow order in market order 9:30am ET no matter how low it is, will be my 22nd different short position into earnings next week! So simple yet so easy."
Chips stocks are underperforming because they're selling all they have.Not because there's no demand .
"They destroyed the families,they destroyed the small businesses, they destroyed the middle class, they destroyed interest rates and lured you into the ""holy grail"" of stocks market, that was never as expensive as nowadays. Face the reality. They will not stop on your beloved stonks. Care about the people you love, your families, friends, and let THEM eat dust. That us the only way to defeat em."

"If you haven't watched NIO Day yet... you can watch it on Youtube here... the partnership between $NIO and $NVDA will be huge. Highly recommend you read up on NIO too, they are not just the 'Tesla of China'.... They are so much more. www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtvit9aBOo Welcome to the family!"
I bought this at 149.... just on the advice of a UCLA economics major who had 3 more years to his BA. wish I could thank him now.
will beat earnings by a mile and raise outlook
NVDA will be -$50 today by the close. Just got the word. 200 day has been permanently breached now the big money is short

"Alphabet, Google, Microsoft and Qualcomm are all scared senseless by little Nvidia. The know Nvidia is becoming a tech-juggernaught who gets to call all the shots. Nvidia will be trading in the trillions.Nvidia is king. All hail the king!Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among the companies raising concerns about Nvidia's pending acquisition of ARM to antitrust officials, David McLaughlin, Ian King and Dina Bass of Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the process. At least one of the companies wants the deal killed, the reporters note. The deal is under review by the Federal Trade Commission, which has opened an in-depth investigation of the merger and has sent information demands to third parties, a source told Bloomberg. An Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement: ""As we proceed through the review process, we're confident that both regulators and customers will see the benefits of our plan to continue Arm's open licensing model and ensure a transparent, collaborative relationship with Arm's licensees. Our vision for Arm will help all Arm licensees grow their businesses and expand into new markets."""
"Massive overreaction after a great ER. Cramer pumped it and Jensen was on his show. This baby is going right back up. Look at Mar 2020 crash as well, this was quickest to recover not only in semis but entire market."
"Few companies come under the absurd microscope that Nvidia does. NVDA can blow earnings out of the water and investors will be ""concerned"" re decelerating revenue. NVDA can kill it on revenue and it's guidance that will have investors spooked. I think everyone should buy 100 shares and go to Tahiti. Upon your return you'll be a lot richer and investors will still have something to complain about."
Wow. Never thought I'd be able to load up again at this price. NICE!
I bought shares on Tuesday and sold on Wednesday before the earnings release as I correctly anticipated that the share price will decline. I may buy again today and hope to sell for a quick pop in a day or two. I am enjoying my hit & run tactics.
So what is nvidia's plan b if they can't make the arm deal happen? Does the stock trade sideways until they close or nix the deal? Thanks for any replies. Long term holder of this stock.

"NVDA poking through upper resistance, a buy signal"
There were many weak hands selling their shares today after prices moved to the top end of the recent trading range.... for short term traders that decision could be right or wrong.... I traded this like that originally in early 2017 the stock got away and regretted the exit at 235... I was fortunate to get another chance when it dipped under 150 and decided I wouldn't ever sell it again.... the run ups are always greater than the pullbacks.... those that hold this monster long term will never regret... gl to all...
a 50% retrace of the 614 to 467 sell down takes nvda back to 540x
Gee ANOTHER bloodbath tomorrow? Why is huang still CEO?
I warned the long term NVDA bag  holders that once the broke margined Robinhood traders got in that was the end of the stock
NEW 52 WEEK HIGH.BUY NVIDIA NOW
severe shortage of chips around the world. The U.S. Industries and the U.S. Government has mentioned that and so have the Chinese etc. The U.S. industries have requested the Federal Government to fund the expansion of the production facilities. Buy NVIDIA and others or you can buy a semi-conductor Mutual Fund such as FSELX etc. I bet you and I are sitting on a boom the like of which we have never heard of seen in our lives.
"Man, when this “thing” falls, it drops like under pants  on prom night"

$60 GONE in 6 days that’s so awesome
"When it eclipsed 400, I thought a split should have occurred. Considering the psychology of a retail trader, many stay away from high priced stocks; especially in the semiconductor business. A case can be made to not split in the attempt to prevent a runaway PE. Regardless, if management has been considering a split, it may be wise to wait until things cool off and we get back over 600."
Where were the Reddit traders today.
"Raise your hands bashers if you're ready to miss the next leg up. The shorts have helped me to retire sooner than expected this year so they deserve some special attention imo. It's like Valentine for shorts, lol."

"So if you would have sold NVDA and bought NFLX like I told you, you would be up $8."
Its a great report. AH price action will not scare me.
ALOHA MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL KONA HAWAII! HEADING OUT OF HONOKOHAU HARBOR GOING FISHING FOR WHATEVER WE CAN GET INTO. LIFE IS GOOD MY FRIENDS! LIFE IS GOOD!BUY MORE NVIDIA!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
"The pullback from the highs in most tech companies, but especially the semis has been rotation and nothing more. When the rotation ends these stocks will hit new highs. Cheers."
"The best part about being short NVDA is you know when it’s down $15 it won’t bounce back a penny, BUT when it’s up $15, it’s always WHAT TIME RED by the end of the day"
Would be a real good idea to sell 600+ stock; anyone see AMD INTC QCOM after earnings? The other 3 biggest fabless chip stocks in the world. Greed
NVDA unstoppable in 2021! Yep check the summary page.
I see NVIDIA’S stock price drifting lower for the next 6-9 months.The ARM’S deal ain’t happening!!!
I have my good til cancel cover in at $460. Been waiting a few months but it’s coming within a week
You own a Ponzi scheme stock NVDA that is an ATM for insiders of the company love  HUANG selling $100m a week every week in 2021. That has to give you ponzi holders some confidence? The CEO selling his stonk paying 43% cap gains just to get it in cash paying 0%

Ark Investment (Cathy Wood) bought NVDA on two separate Buys today. Many Investors follow her every day trades and a very bullish signal. She has a huge following her every stock buy. We been in a trading trade now for a while. Time to break out 
"What the Reddit pundits do not say is thatNVDA, has significant earnings and has for years.Anticipated top and bottom growth is expected tobe awesome. Buying a Groovy company with no earnings and nonein near future to try and beat the hedge funds is just stupid.Check out who owns Reddit!"
NVDA will close at its lows of the day then gap down to $460 on Wednesday night. Trade accordingly
Both NVDA and AVGO hit all time highs today!
Why the 13-point drop from day's high on a very good day for the market?
$532 is a lock then $528 if that breaks $468

So AAPL made $111.9billion in 3 months and the stock is down $5+ in after hours and you all think when NVDA reports the stock is going higher? Smoke  some more crack. What time $504? Been calling $504 from $560. Remember Superman?
Great volume and $30 below her 200 day moving average. Put up the yearly chart on NVDA from $615 to $450 without an uptick! So funny 
HELLO MY FELLOW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS FROM BEAUTIFUL LAKE TAHOE!JUST GOT HOME FROM A MORNING OF SNOW SHOEING. FUN FUN FUN!WITH THE NASDAQ DOWN IT'S A GREAT DAY TO ADD SOME SHARES AND DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!ALWAYS BUY ON MARKET GENERATED PULLBACKS. THEY ARE GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITIES.DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN.
I just ripped the loudest smelliest  gas ️  out by the Breakers Pool  and blamed it on some guy next to me who is long NVDA
"Investors are afraid the shortage may result to poorer sales, but it's just common sense. High demand + low supply = higher prices. Higher prices will make up for low sales quantities which even improves their margins. Time to load up"
and now I'm buying back very heavy
Remember Kevin has made ALL his Fantasy Money imagining NVDA'S price drop...IN HIS DREAMS!
$500 re-test coming up.Don't expect it to hold this time.
PT $800
Anyone smart in this industry knows that the ARM acquisition would never get approved. This is a good thing because the deal was way too expensive anyway. The stock should be soaring as a result of a failed acquisition.
NVDA 200 day MA is $490 We are @ $460 or soR.I.P. NVDA it’s been a nice ride from $300+ pre covid to $460Really a decent gain from low to high of 40%. I don’t count that BS $180 covid panic low
"NVDA is at 200dma and 2nd support level of the pivot , and oversold at bottom od stcochastic. RSI also at bottom. Going Bullish . Good Luck"
Better get on this dip before it’s to late!
hallelujah

"at a turning point imo, there's too much volatility , once the train starts rollin' again you better be on it."

Holding on to Nvidia like
Does anyone sell calls on their positions so they can buy more shares?
AVGO up $16 and going much higher after earnings this Thursday. LRCX up $25. NVDA up 77 cents. Oh no !
anyone see my GME? Going to $1000Was $39 2 weeks ago NVDA btw down $180 and up $12 pre market has to fill the gap sooner or later so short now
Nvidia is the dinosaur of the graphics chips. Intel Xe is the new kid on the block. The future in graphics.
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!!!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
in my over 50 years of investing I ain't felt more confident than I feel today investing in the chip sector. I thought may be I stay quiet and don't advertise to others but then it would have been so selfish on my behalf. When the government sayeth we have a chip shortage and the private companies agree and foreign govermnents agree and are anxious it tell yo something. Folks buy into the chip sector because I am doing that too.
"Stopped in it's tracks at 500. If it can get through there, it may be off to the races."

$600 loading. Cases going down is big news
I still can’t even comprehend how this was actually 519 today or was that a fake/trade print?
Remember when this dropped from $290 to $129? That crime spree will pale in comparison to this next evisceration. $615 ——> $450. Huang will guarantee it
Nice day trader stock today
Nvda should be trading in the $800’s.
near the lows late yesterday i stated nvda was a good company at a decent entry price for true long-term investorsand trade-types toonvda 3/10 500c from 5.5 to 14 last trade
"“We are very excited about how Veritone is leveraging the power of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platforms to streamline the management and optimization of clean energy. We believe that this will help provide more predictable and reliable energy,” said Keith Cockerham, Utilities Industry Lead at NVIDIA. “The combination of Veritone CDI and NVIDIA EGX provides the millisecond-level autonomous decision-making capabilities required for smart grid management and resiliency.”Veritone is focusing their initial NVIDIA migration efforts on energy optimization of complex smart grids, and plan to develop optimized solutions for grid and electric car batteries in the future. For grid batteries, fast and accurate modeling of batteries on NVIDIA EGX are planned to increase battery utilization, reduce the risk of thermal events and extend battery life. For electric car batteries, the two companies plan to integrate Veritone’s dynamic modeling with NVIDIA EGX, which is expected to improve range, battery longevity and reduce the risk of thermal events."
and dats dat bummer rising interest rates created an epic exodus from high beta growth stocks and rotated into financials and industrials and commodities nvda did it's job with a solid beat and raisemarket will come around to its senses and see the screaming value of nvda going forward
NVDA is going back to $299 in 2021. 100%. Please trade accordingly. This game is not hard.
ITRI now up over 20% since posting good ER early this morning
"Aapl, Amzn, Msft, and now Nvda. All had great earnings and all are lower. Big tech is not cutting it. Why do you think people are buying these garbage spacs and Gme."
"NVDA is going to $299 in March. Then I will cover and go long. Will be in here all day a perma bull, BUT not a penny before"
"This sell off has left everyone out of buying power. We all got used to quick rebounds. I’ve been buying on the way down but I’m still waiting on sidelines to buy large position. I know worst case scenario is very strong support level and absolute bottom at 375 but I don’t see it breaking much lower than where we are at. 455 is another strong support, only issue is everyone is out of cash so it could get manipulated lower. Anyways long term is key."
$504 will be here within a few minutes please trade accordingly
Slowly slowly everything is turning positive. I take this opportunity to buy more
"NVDA + $564 = Superman + Kryptonite Why, after a year posting this everyday, does no one listen to me?"
Don’t worry longs this will reverse by end of day
Bottom is in
"joe needs to come out and talk! otherwise, we may see a repeat of last March..."
OK now got my 544 short large now 549 NVDA R.I.P.
"When Kevin is Right, He is Right!Unfortunately, even at $550 he is down $400k on his shorts!!! "
"When will this market will move forward.. incurring huge loses.. #NVIDIA, NIO all sinking...Unbearable.. Sad"
How come NVDA price declined even yahoo analysts strongly advised and recommended to buy at hiked price. But something is brewing by insiders to book profits.
Funny how stocks go down between 10am-11am as traders go on break and then again between 12noon-1pm when they go to lunch.Best buying opportunity when you know when the dip is coming.
You all long and strong $615 to $468 here? Now lower than Friday crash lows with Dow up 700. 
Should hold $550 down $30 tomorrow going by the options chart
Imagine if NVDA didn’t get 5 upgrades to $700 by influential analysts from major brokerage houses ? Bwaaaa lol 
"NVDA goes to $1,000 soon."
This is deliberate price action down. They want to shake out loose hands and get in lower rate. No worries. It will be positive territory before tomorrow open.
NVDA fell 60% last March That takes it to under $300 this March
NASDAQ will be down 1000 tomorrow minimum 10 year is 1.5%
I THINK TODAY CALLS FOR A NVIDIA ROCKET. YESTERDAY WAS THE JUMP ON BOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN. TODAY IS THE NVIDIA ROCKET LAUNCH. THIS ONE'S FOR ALL THE HATERS.
"I’ve been trading 30 years. I have seen this pattern 1000x. No one could explain why a stock under performs the market by 50% for 6 months, the CEO is selling $1b in stock, and bam, “the bad news” is released with earnings, and falls 50%."
"Except for that false breakout up above 600, this stock has been in a clear bullish flag pattern on the longer term daily chart. It is testing the lower boundary of that channel but as long as the 494-500 area holds, the long term technical picture hasn't changed imo."
START BUYING! DON'T MISS GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITIES!DOLLAR COST AVERAGE IN!ACCUMULATE SHARESALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
Needham raises NVDA price target to 800
Shorts: What time red tomorrow? (it's friday)
"Guys I got a serious problem. Every time Nvidia drops, I buy. I think I'm addicted and may need help. I just want more and more."
"Buy, hold, buy more, hold more etc..."
"$610, someone please turn the light off !"
"nvda consolidating for 6months. fang stocks report next week, if we see them pop upwards nvda will also pop up after earnings!!"
"Saw $552 and walked away from the quotes for a while. I know it fell $50 yesterday & $90 this week, is it $575 yet??"
I see NVDA $504 after earnings for sure! I also see down $50 today by the close
"surprised to see Nvida fall today, It is better than most of the Tech stuff out there."
$600 will be denied!!!!!!
"Question for serious longs. Is it too late to get into NVIDIA? The well-known idea that the higher the SP is of an equity, the lower the ROI. Curious what others think. I currently have holdings in 4 other chip stocks: QCOM, AMD, UMC, and TSM."
$504 gap now will be filled. Trade accordingly & good luck  everyone
This was a gift at $250 in March. I’m starting to consider taking some profits off the table at $600
Nvda touches $550 on Thursday with huge rally in NAS once again. 1.9 trillion actually going to real people does count after all. Markets doesn’t crash until rates go up enough where all the very interest rate sensitive derivatives blow up in to not one not two but all 5 of the too big to fail banks. This time the masters of the universe don’t get bailed out. Too bad so sad lol.
Next gap to fill $611.
@kevin > You bragged about GME last week. Down 25% TODAY. Why aren't you discussing that today?
NVDA is the future...that will help the future become a better future!!!! 5-10 YEARS STRONG!!!!! Diamond hands only!!!!! LFG!!!
NVDA is nothing more than an ATM for insiders to buy mansions cars boats strippers etc
Will be down $50 at some point today GUARANTEED
Seems like a great  short here at $510
Did NVDA split ? I bought is at $615 but my account is not showing additional shares. Oh no !
Where were you when NVIDIA got back to its normal range?
"Robin hood's rushed in for the great great NVidia bargain, buybuybuy, you have to buy as long as it's 512, fast fast already 517 buy now buy because it goes Higher"
Uh oh  I am afraid to look  I see Nasdaq is up 100 NVDA has to be like 520
i can almost hear kevin's misfiring synapse from here
what time  red tomorrow? Any good  guesses?
Wonder if the QQQ can go all the way down and fill the post election gap at $276.
Pinning my hopes on NVDA not being part of the 30% overall market drop in the coming months.
"At $481.99 I posted, go back and read it, NVDA would hit $199 before $482. Simple yet so easy"
The smartest lady in Silicon Valley ( no not CW) just sent me an alert that she is bought NVDA. Everything this woman touches goes to gold. Full disclosure I subscribe to her service.
"AAPL's trying to take out Friday's low. If it happens, it'll probably drag the whole index down with it."
Another -$20 today ? All to common now
"So my ZS beats by a penny and basically lowers guidance stock up $10 LOL NVDA beats by .50 and ups guidance next quarter by 1/2 billion, amd drops $50! LOL "
"This is momentum selling now, fear has taken over, three days below the 200 DMA, this will be back over $490 by Wednesday or Thursday. Oversold on the daily, one more day below 200 DMA for weekly"
"LADIES & Germs  boys and freaks, WHAT TIME $450? 9:30  am EST"
Is NVDA still up $15? I am afraid to look 
NVDA great companyHorrible stock Went from 150 to 300 back to 150 to 600 now going back to 300
NVDA all time high 614 won’t ever even come close to that again I pray down $100 today then $100 after earnings
"so the comments are nothing actually helpful, rather shorts and longs battling against who is right lmao, kinda funny to watch. If anyone wants to know what is going to happen, do you research, have your reasons for what you are doing and then follow them. GL all for earnings"
keep shorting this is great. I am loading the boat. Next year at this time NVDA should be over $800.
$625 this week no problem should see $700 before spring.
NVDA last 4 days:Down $50Up $4 (NASDAQ was +400)Down $18Will be down $50 today
"People still gambling buying inflated equities like NVDA. When the crunch comes, can't say there was no warning signs like trading at 26x revenue and PE of 100!"
Sorry shorts
I will see you all on the beach in about 10 years.
"Ok, who bought the dip and who choked? Be honest."
"Nio partners with Nvidia.Nvidia stock is being resupplied and a massive deal with samsung.More gpus are coming , budget and high end for all the players.CES is due tomorrow.Earning are going to be a another blowout.Frankfurt stock @ +2.68%.Solid premarket."
Nice recovery. Should be green tomorrow. This was an excellent report...
I still can’t even fathom or comprehend $519 LOL  literally crying laughing thinking about it ever trading that high in our lifetimes
Totally overpriced
"yes, baby. lift me up"
"Next week, say hello to $550"
just bought more today. just cannot go wrong.
nvda +7.5% today at 498.53 more +7.5% day's takes nvda to 619oh boy
Did I mention it is a beautiful day?
No worries. It's going to pick up more investors at the cheaper price. It's going to hit 800.
"positive news for the company, catalyst for bull trend with 10 year yield on the way down"
Last days to buy at discounted price.
you had your chance
"“Rotation out of sector” is thinly veiled code for: wealthy investors do not care about the future of this country, they will not keep their holdings in badly needed sectors like chip makers if they think they can make more money on a SPAC or Bitcoin. Big money is immoral, it screwed you in ‘08, and as the yields inverse in ‘19 shows, they will screw us again, and are."
Suits are trying to weed out the gutless This is a rigged market and we are just here for donations. Hold on if you can for ARM if the market can stay afloat you will be happy
"In at $513, order to sell at $521 hopefully it fills at open tomorrow."
Since that “Awesome” beat. “
$660 short term .. 700... 800 long term. finally broke upper channel and coming out of consolidation (hiding)
Where are you
iv in nvda options have blown up
"Citi analyst Atif Malik favors semiconductor names over semiconductor capital equipment in the first half of 2021 on peaking wafer fab equipment run rate. He moved Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) to his number one pick and Nvidia (NVDA) to his number two pick. Malik lowered Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA Corp. (KLAC) down by two spots on his ranking list to three and four respectively, On the materials and components group, the analyst maintains Entegris (ENTG) at number one and moves II-VI (IIVI) to his number two pick. He remains Sell rated on Amkor Technology (AMKR) due to long-term margin contraction concerns and CMC Materials (CCMP) due to top line weakness and competitive threats."
Anyone see “Legend” around today? That guy is amazing & makes amazing calls. Probably the most informative poster on any Yahoo Message Board
Impressive. Shouldn't SEC investigate this manipulation ?
NVDA will be $470 after earnings or I will never post again in here
27 short positions from 468 last July to 614 and haven’t covered one share 
"$100,000,000,000 knocked off NVDA market cap in a week LOL while INTC has gone up!!!!"
65% odds Nvda hits 550 by next Thersday.
Kevin is ashamed to post so he is posting under the name Darth Trader
they are shorting 2 shares at a time. what a joke
NVDA 515 is my #1 short ever in 30 years of trading short it buy outs sell calls
target $103 in 52 weeks
"Just like a rocket lifting off, starts slow and then"
"Crypto's going up parabolic for the past 3-6 months wouldn't cause anybody to buy video cards, would it?? How cheap are those latest video cards? Probably very little profit in those....BAWAHAWHAWHAWH!"
"After earnings, on February 24, NVDA will be trading north of 654! Mark my words! All the SHORTS SELLS will get BURNT BIG times."
Where is that bear that wanted 515? Better get in before 615.
NVDA +$564 = Superman + Kryptonite zzzzzzz 
Charts for 336..no support before 472
"Nice pre earnings move. These results being reported bode well for NVDA. Let’s see if we can get 550 tomorrow, 600 after earnings."
It seems like a new economy has emerged. An economy where companies on the verge of bk could triple in a matter of 3 hours and companies with solid eps could crash
"Strong price action, most on my watchlist are red."
"nvda is a $600B Co, take that to the bank"
NVDA down $3 is like an up day for longs
"I repeat, below $500 this weekend"
New ATH today?
"I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT ON THIS EXACT MESSAGE BOARD SINCE 2016, BUY AND HOLD NVIDIA LONGTERM DOLLAR COST IN ON A REGULAR BASIS IRREGARDLESS OF PRICE. BUY EVERY WEEK OR MONTH. KUST BUY AND HOLD.IN 2016 NVIDIA WAS TRADING AT $25 MY ORIGINAL BUY POINT. i SAID THEN IT WOULD BE A 10 BAGGER (ALA PETER LYNCH).I NOW SAY NVIDIA $1200-2000 IN 12-18 MONTHS.ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAINBUY NVIDIA TODAY!"
$700 Near term price target 1-4 weeks.
Nvidia has sold every 3000 series GPU they've ever made since October and still it's not enough for the demand.
Down $50 tomorrow is my lock of the century sub $500 then AMD releases their new gaming card next week and BAM down another $100!! Save this brilliance
"BITCOIN REACHED ALL NEW RECORD HIGH OVER $52,000....AND SO NVDA WHICH INVESTED HEAVILY IN BITCOIN MACHINES WILL GREATLY BENEFITS FROM IT....BUY MORE NVDA FOR GREAT E/R AHEAD NEXT WEEK....BY TODAY 'S DIP 'S BEST FOR MORE PROFITS LATER....."
Tremendous buying into the close and after. The infamous head fake earlier in the day to shake out some weak hands and traders and then VRoooom! NVidia always retraces to its previous high so we will get back over $600 and then onto $650. IMHO 
612.70 now
"Let me ask you longs a serious  question: When the NASDAQ rose 500 points the other day and NVDA was up $1, why didn’t you sell and short? It was $557"
"As I said, $500 by the weekend, $103 by the year"
Cathy Wood is looooooosing money. Looks like she bought my shares at $555. Oh No !
See you in the late summer @ 675 / 700
NVDA is going to rise tomorrow. Other hedge fund is going to invest into nvda. NVDA is going to join with Nio and help produce chips for them.
NVDA has some decent support $520 for now

"The GJJ supercomputer was much better than Alllllllllll the mother supercomputers put together. That’s why GJJ told you that the 600 calls were worthless for as far as the eye could see. I didn’t read that in a book. Because the “book” tells you that options follow stock prices. But that dumb book was written before weekly options and before supercomputers, high frequency traders, and AI algorithms reading your social posts. You can deep fry that book and serve it with sauce."

"Someone asked today why I spend my entire life trolling and abusing garbage  stocks/companies like NVDA? Well, I am like the lead guy in the show Billions.

NASDAQ up 50NVDA down $10Any questions?
Imagine betting against nvidia while the crypto market is exploding
Anyone who is selling bc NVIDIA isn’t hitching their wagon to Bitcoin doesn’t understand NVIDIA and deserves to lose money.
"OMG  Did you all see this? NVDA is up a penny .01 in after hours. The crash has stopped. No worries longs, everything is great. Only has to rise $42 to break even from almost this morning! $606 this am, remember? My god"

The Chinese are experiencing a severe shortage, the United States government is experiencing a severe shortage and so are the companies such as GM and Ford etc. An appeal has been sent out to the United States government to help establish more manufacturing facilities. I feel absolutely fantastic about this sector. My advise buy individual companies or by FSELX from Fidelity. I am sure there are other family of funds which provide semiconductor funds . I am very happy to share this with you"
But I know it will be well past 600 in twelve months!

Right at the 200day sma now.
NVDA wiped out all the bloated weekly call options again LOL  like clockwork for 7 months now every week same story
NVDA down $7 is it’s best day in a month lol 
way way overdone
Tomorrow the reddit crowd could jump in. Be prepared for lift off.
I truly hope that someone listened to me and sold half and kept half to let it ride greed is one of the 7 deadly sins do not get caught up in all these calls for 600 be smart
Will be interesting to see what this thing does with 500. Could be a massive short squeeze there.
"Nvidia is set to release its latest quarterly report at a tricky moment in the semiconductor industry. There aren't enough chips for products ranging from cars to the graphics cards made by Nvidia, and far too many buyers.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for Nvidia's (ticker: NVDA) videogame chips has far outpaced the number of consumers seeking the cards that include them. Prices remain high in secondary markets, reportedly double what the company recommends, well over a quarter after the Ampere-based chips became available.As irked as gamers -- or cryptocurrency miners, another group of buyers -- might be by the lack of supply, the surging demand has driven up forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter sales in Nvidia's videogame segment to $2.39 billion. That is nearly half of the overall revenue of $4.82 billion Wall Street expects. It would be the greatest dollar amount the videogame segment has generated in Nvidia's historyThe consensus estimate for adjusted per-share earnings is $2.81 a share."
Well it was a good couple days. Does NVDA usually trade up to down before earnings?
S0S short Sellers dont say I didn't warn you.
"NVDA “dip buyers” R.I.P. ROTFLMFAO at all longs who don’t realize the power of my firm.FREE-DUMB 6000 shares long NVDA x $50 loss = $300,000. Umm, no more trips, no more skiing  no more nothing but Mom’s basement with wood  panels"
So down $20 yesterday on huge volume up $5 today on zero volume
Is this Kevin the old Larry? this forum is dominated by bears now...where's Kal?
The best bet is to short every stock before earnings. It seems to work.
"NIO YF board is rather excited for the partnership with NVDA announced today. Welcome, partners (smile). We can expect this to be long-term, as NIO production ramps up and up, including globally.Do take a look at NIO's new (first) ET7 sedan, showcased as well today, on YouTube. Gawd, the thing is a beauty. All seats even come with massage (smile). But the tech (including AI and voice recognition) in this car is multiples of Tesla's (at this juncture). Apparently, NIO felt they needed NVDA to help with that. The TSLA Model 3 instantly looked its age today."
Looks like we have rested long enough. Time to march on.
"I say down $20 tomorrow NVDA Not even down $10 today, which I predicted. Will be $460 after earnings. Feel bad for anyone who bought over $460!"
Why is a $700. stock selling so CHEAP?
CONGRATULATIONS NEW NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS!!!TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY TO BUY!WELCOME TO THE NVIDIA FAMILY YOU WILL BE RICH SOON!!!
"nvidia chipset going to be the foundation of skynet, goodluck when the ai take over"
I still can’t believe NVDA was up 2 days in a row before this deep BLOOD  RED DAY TODAY! Anyone here old enough to remember +$15?
NVDA will fall $100 by the close on the missed earnings
Needless to say that their consumer cards (gaming and mining combined) could almost double in sales then. Great news. (and something that I thought was in the pipeline for some time)
600 wall coming up my friends... Best.
"it's just like other big tech, huge beat but still cannot be up :Dsell the news @@"
It feels really good being short a stock like NVDA that’s so top heavy it can never go higher ever
"sorry guys, fully cashed out today on NVDA, made small money, but too crazy these days, need more cash aside...good luck everyone"
I recall almost buying here to add a few months back.
"To bashers, spammers, suicide-paper-shorts; zip it and die. Thanks in advance."

"Anytime Kevin starts saying NVDA will never be a certain price ever again, I start buying. It’s proven every single time to make me money. Thank you Kevin"
back to 200s?
why doesn't btc put all the number crunching and energy consumption towards solving the supernova explosion in govt disability rolls and the explosion in the professional homeless with severe drug/alcohol addictionswe know what the end calculation would be:cut off the chronics and ship them and the professional homeless to fema camps in remote deserts with no internet access that's the only calculation that makes sense
"Just wondering if much of yesterday's rally were buys by those thinking the earnings call was on Feb 11? Over the weekend, I watched 2 new videos about NVIDIA, both said earnings were on the 11th (rather than the correct Feb 24th date)."
Will close today down $10 then down $10 tomorrow and Friday
Anyone here old enough to remember $500+??????
NASDAQ TECH FIRE SALE! TEMPORARY SECTOR ROTATION.BUYING OPPORTUNITY GIFT.BUY BUY AND BUY MORE!
This is total b.s.
"Huang and Nvda board, I hope is smart people to run the company..there is a lot of momentum in the stock market in general due to various factors...If nvda board takes a page out of Apple and Tesla, industry leaders in their respective field than splitting the stock makes sense. Let’s say pre earnings stock price is $650 and if the earnings reported on 24th feb is way better than expected then if they announce 4 to 1 split.. stock could run up to $800 or more.Post split price of $200..Two or three quarters of solid returns after split on strong chip demand should bring price of nvda back to close to $400 andif ARM deal goes through or not as per nvda board thinks it may take 18 months.. this stock has room to grow just like appl and tsla and back to $600, if no deal than it may lose 20-25% at most and back to $300 still a much better price ($1200)JMOGOOD LUCK ALL"
Been selling calls shorting stock and buying puts all say since 555 NVDA while I buy calls sell puts long AMD
"Nvidia price target raised to $625 from $610 at Susquehanna, BUYSusquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $625 from $610 and keeps a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst met with management who communicated the demand backdrop is very, very healthy. He believes any supply shortage is because demand is so strong not the impact of industrywide shortages. Rolland is encouraged by the demand but believes industrywide shortages could limit the most optimistic of bull scenarios."
TRXC is up 25% today. Just got FDA approval for robotic surgery.Intuitive Surgical has some competition now.
"Finally, a respectable correction in the technology sector. There are some sweet opportunities today in $NVDA, $LRCX, $AMAT and $KLAC to name just a few. I just started buying mid day and you should too."
Relax longs. weak hands are out...tome for 650-750 in a few weeks is my guess. do your own diligence.
"OK NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS, LET'S LAUNCH A NVIDIA ROCKET TODAY. HERE WE GO....BLAST OFF!"
Would be positive to end above the 200 day moving average of 489.65. Bounced off this morning and now above it as I write this.
"one month ago, 17th Feb this stock was at circa $590, today apparently there's a world semi conductor chip shortage and it's sitting at $531....pull the other one, it's got bells on"

"1 year or year chart people. we are waiting on earnings for a real move up or down! It is however, following a bullish wedge pattern the past months. Patience."
$NIO $WIMI $NVDA Pre-market is telling us that investors are buying the dip. Just like what will happen tomorrow.

In the wise words of Nelson Muntz; Hah..! Hah..!!

"When Cramer the rookie and Cathie Woods of ARKK get involved with any stock, run for zee hills"
This could drop to $500 or below next week
Kevin? Thoughts?
"Zero chance Nvidia will get approval to acquire ARM.QCOM, MSFT, GOOGLE, AMZN, UK, EU , China are all against it."
"Another upgrade:""Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar maintains NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $575 to $625."""
"For newcomers to semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stock investing initially you'll experience something similar to shaken baby syndrome but after a year you won't feel anything and you'll just keep adding shares during opportunities in the violent action. You'll get up in the morning grab some snacks sit at your trade station, read this board, have a few laughs and make good money."
"10 year is ready to go below 1.55, NVDA goes to $500, watch and learn."
Some big holder is divesting its position. once done in day or two it will fly
Kevin placed on ignore
