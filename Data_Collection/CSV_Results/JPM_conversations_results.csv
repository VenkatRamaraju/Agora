Recent headlines and conversations for JPM
no Tom everybody is not
"Why hasn't JPM split its shares?Had it done a 3 : 1 split, the ""pain"" wouldn't have been nearly as bad.Share price would have only been down ~1.83/share yesterday."
Watch gold over the next few days it will be going straight up And silver will go right with it

"When everyone thinks bank stocks (JPM, BAC, WFC, etc.) are going up, short them."
They Democrats have passed 2 different stimulus packages. It's the Republicans than dont want to pass a bill. There is a 600 billion dollar difference between the 2 bills. So now they want to start worrying about money after they have already spent 27 trillion. Cmon give me a break. All those politicians are self serving and only in DC to enrich themselves. All politicians should wear a ski mask when giving a speech.
"Awsome business man, time for everyone to check thier blood pressure. Stock market in daily chaos. Great investment at this deflated price."

"I strongly believe that a ""second wave"" of the virus this fall will be nothing more than a slight uptick nowhere as bad as feared. People are going to be very careful and business establishments are going to enforce safety measures because the last thing they want to risk is being forced to shut down again. The vaccine is coming, but the economy will continue it's recovery in the meantime. Stay at home stocks have peaked and tech is fully valued with little potential upside. The momentum has shifted to the big banks and those loading up at present values will be rewarded. I grabbed JPM a couple weeks ago @ $89."
"Analysts/traders always question if banks can repeat great earnings and thus sell at the news, but most of the times banks do. What's the problem then? Maybe those analysts and traders are the problems"

"FOMC is injecting $120,000,000,000 per month of bond buying ! The Federal Reserve Bank is a private entity and they must do everything possible keep the markets flowing. Inflate or DIE !! They must keep the steroid injection going until the market is self sufficient and can resolve itself. Powell already said they will continue buying bonds until they see ""substantial inflation"". We have at least one year to get back on track. along the way there maybe 500-1000pt corrections on the DOW, but no matter they cannot let the world economy die. They must keep inflating. Overall Bull market continues !!"
Strong resistance at 100
strong earnings and stock turns red... way too common nowadays
A few days ago I looked at the US debt clock it was around 26 trillion 850 billion as of today The death clock stands at $27 trillion and we have basically zero interest rates can you imagine if rates would ever normalize what the amount paid on the interest would be wrap your head around this but they don’t want you to wrap your head around this they want you to watching football watching baseball all the political pandering that is going on and most of it is complete nonsense the last thing they want you to understand is your standard of living is about to drop through the floor do United States as a reserve currency of the world had special privileges because all oil is bought in US dollars if you look out through history the big dog on the street with Spain then England and now the United States But we’re in the late stages of the fourth quarter so who’s gonna be the next dominant player the only question is will it be China or will it be Russia but our days in the sun are numbered why JP Morgan himself said so many years ago silver and gold or money and everything else is credit

JPM is still very cheap. They have all of the money. There is money in banking.
JPM and American banks should follow Euro to cap CEO pay and bonus. Money belongs to share holders. ING chief was slapped by Govt to cap the pay even ING has excellent results and growth as a branchless bank in a oligopoly market. it projected growth in double digits and money is returning to shareholders. JPM CEO is great but so does ING CEO

"I think this will recover to $125 to $130 pretty soon, so anywhere under or in the low $100’s is a great buy in point and a very unusual chance to get into this so low. Large potential gain with very low risk in my opinion."

JPM is not even buying their own stock. Their own people have set a price point of $125.
Now that the Government is in charge of all big bank dividends and the banks now have no say when or if the Government can and will cut the banks dividend. At the first signs of any major slow down or recession all big banks become NOT investable and any moves higher should now be sold. All big banks should and will be trading at a discount to the market. Why because NO ONE wants to get stuck holding any Big bank stock that can't pay a dividend ever again. No matter What Jamie thinks the Government cut JPM dividend and the Government will do it again.
"stock market will continue going up to history high, because all companies earnings not bad, it's worth to buy, jpm is #1, because there are a lot of companies and people need bank's money to re-build their finance,"

Investing in the Banks are not worth the risk of the FED getting it right or wrong at the level the banks are trading at. Why the banks are run by the Government and if the slow down is to big the government will just have them cut the dividends. JPM at $70 might be worth the risk but at $100 not worth taking that risk
"GE SHAREHOLDERS START CONTACTING REPUTED ATTORNEYS, IS GE HEALTHCARE BOOMING DEMAND BEING UNDERREPORTED, AND JPM/Culp behind it ???

Will the betrayal of the Kurds by Trump be bullish or bearish? Money is the only thing that matters right?
Believe it or not even BBBY is a safer stock now and its dividend is safer than JPM because of all the actions the guys have taken at BBBY they even whacked upper management which is like a signal that the dividend is safe. The DEM wits in the Government will force all big banks to cut their dividends next your and destroy the economy So DEM wit can be president just like they did in 2008
Job market heating up...scares of a talent or growth????
Wait until household unemployment and stimulus runs out. That will take a few thousand mortgages credit cards with it
The volume is insane. And for every seller there’s a buyer. This is a screaming BUY in my opinion
being downgrade. u should sell jpm
"JPM/BAC are great holds in this inflationary environment. Let me tell you how this little sham works.1) When USG issues Bonds, Primary dealers like JPM buy them. They then sell those Bonds to the FED through quantative easing, This increases Bank Reserves. JPM can then lend to Hedge fund XYZ on a fractional basis and that hedge fund then speculates on stocks(generally going up). This is how inflation is kept inside the financial system( for the most part). So it doesn't matter how much the FED prints.2) Now Helicopter money, or stimulus checks they like to call it. That can be inflationary. However household debt is so high right now that people either put the cash in the bank(JPM) Pay off their house/auto/credit card with it(JPM). Rarely does that money chase actual goods.So if you want to hop on the train i strongly suggest you buy JPM, BAC"
"Thumbs up if you think JPM is headed higher, based on its tepid- looking chart, decline in fossil fuel sales, and fact it is the biggest lender to greenhouse has emitters.Thumbs down if you think JPM is headed down, based upon fossil energy sector's poor earnings, and ones' commitment to"

"I wish the democrats just stay away from markets and business....the drop in the last 10 minutes started with Sherman and Bernie Sanders looking to place a bill for a vote that is called ""too big to fail. too big to exist"" which on a hypothetical crisis that may require another bailout we should break up that bank now. IDIOTS! It will never pass (i hope) but just frustrates me when I hear stupidity (he couldn't even explain logically what the benefit would be). I am a long term holder of JPM, and will continue to hold well into the $130's soon. But I could not believe my ears and eyes. Bernie for President...I THINK NOT!"

Anyone catch the Fed minutes? Almost NO PROBABILITY of the FOMC implement negative interest rates! All that garbage being spewed about on CNBC and elsewhere about rates going negative was a sham...just as I said it was several days ago. But be grateful for this ruse pioneered by liars in the media. It allowed SMART MONEY like me to buy the massive dips in banks. Here's were banks were when the deceivers in the media were all espousing the Fed is going to negative rates last week versus where they are today:RF $8.41...a week later printed $10.08 todayUSB $28.36...a week later printed $33.25 todayBAC $20.10...a week later printed $22.99 todayWFC $22.02...a week later printed $24.74 todayJPM $82.40...a week later printed $90.71 today$BAC $WFC $JPM $UBS $C $RF

What’s really wrong with this country is if your a white person who’s not racist but yet you don’t have freedom of speech... at least with yahoo. They seem to let BLM but not ALL LIVES MATTER.

( to add to my position)
This is headed to below $50 per share . Losses will mount each week as businesses remain closed and loan defaults mount. These times are dangerous for ANY bank. GLTA soo you under $50.
Buy the dips

Some going to jail for manipulating the silver markets, the Big whale mess and the crooked deeds overseas.

"Yesterday I cut my holdings in half and bought Aug 21 puts at $90 to achieve a balance if the remaining stock that I have drops further. As of right now today I am very close to a balance between the paper loss on the common stock and the appreciation in the put options. It worked out very well. This balance will continue until the stock rises. I have the next approximately two months for the turnaround. At some point, I may have to reassess and buy more puts should it continue down. Eventually when it turns I'll just stay long term and the loss on the puts will be very small compared to the gain on the stock. You all should look at this possibility for yourself."
will head up after dividend payout
"I'm neutral re splits, for apparently not so obvious, but legitimate reasons.That said, dividend increases, and even more so annual increases, well that is something to get excited about!2/28/17(Reuters) - ""No. 1 U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) may return more money to shareholders than it earns over the next few years, it forecast on Tuesday, an encouraging sign for investors who have been waiting for richer dividends and share repurchases.The prediction came in documents posted on JPMorgan's website for its annual investor day, where top executives offered their vision for the four major business lines and financial targets for the broader institution.Although JPMorgan is sticking to its long-term target of returning 55 percent to 75 percent of net income to shareholders, the bank could pay out as much as 120 percent in the medium term, according to a presentation. That would mean JPMorgan is generating more than enough profit to invest in its businesses and meet regulatory capital requirements, and can even reduce some of that capital.The new prediction is up from a 65 percent medium-term scenario that JPMorgan offered last year.""It does feel like we have reached an inflection point for capital,"" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said at the event."""
"The Fed will sweep the rug from all bulls DJI to 25,000 in January"
"JPM a buy at $50. Looking to start a position but not at these heights. JPM's p/e in 2011 was 5.25. If it had that valuation today, it would be about $50. During the dotcom crash, JPM fell approx 75%. During the great recession, it fell approx 66%. Drops of those magnitudes would imply prices of approx $35 and $50 today, respectively. I do not see the Dow breaking its March lows, but I am certain that the bank stocks will. For now, my war chest is on the sidelines waiting for another capitulative selloff, perhaps on some panic news that commercial real estate is never coming back."

stock up 5 dollars per share. that is helpful
Loosening the Volker rule will only cause more problems... I don't agree with that.
"I think with the letter Jamie sent out to holders, him giving guidance for 3 years. Will mean that JPM is giving guidance this quarter. And that’s what stock holders want to see. That and loan balances have dropped. Investing has increased. They will hit in every category as they normally do. And Jamie will just talk about business lending growing with a reopening economy. He might even razzzle dazzle and hint at crypto."

Their deaths are on the DEM wits hands for not acting months ago.

Reports beginning to circulate that Hunter Biden and his now felon partners were opening 'back door' bank and trading accounts with JPM for their Russian oligarch and other unsavory 'clients' who were on international monetary watchlists so they could get their money out of Russia. That's what the $3.5 million was for.
i think it is time to short JPM and Trump
Citi warns...Hmmmm
"Mhwahahaha!!!!! All time high today!!!! I bought 4,000 in Sept at fleepin $93!!!!! Jpm is paying me 4% yield to PAY ME a 60% gain!!!!!!"
"Repeat again from my previous post: Still, a lot of room to ""buy all good banks and hold - $BAC $JPM $DFS $PNC $TFC $C $WFC $GS plus 30% to 40% time for banks to bounce as they were all financially strong  - Already 20% up on average as of now... $DFS gave 40% already.

JPM passed the test. Great news for banks.
jpm overvalued
There is no rhyme and reason to the markets right now. It’s all about technicals. This stock formed a bear pole that it just broke. Expect another 15-20% drop
"JPM... Supporting the Recovery...Up 1,100 % in 3 months... AABB.. A New Crypto-currency STOCK for AABBG, a GOLD backed Token from Very Profitable GOLD Mining co. Recent announcement to Increase Stock Dividend payout."

"Nice entry, or re-entry point into JPM! I've carried a small, long position over the years, but will be buying tomorrow. JPM by far the strongest of the Financials. The Covid paranoia is subsiding, as folks are realizing that it has NO ill effects for 99% who actually test positive! Despite the medias efforts, folks are starting to wise up! Natural immunity is spreading as covid weakens! It'll be as common as the cold, chicken pox, or any old, irradicated disease which humans are all now immune to! Financials will bounce back quickly, as this downturn is NOTHING compared to the 2008 recession, which originated in the housing/financial sector due to lax regulatory oversight!"
Did Citi give JPM $900 million?
JPM traders sent home today. Outbreak on the trading floor.
"They increased reserves for bad loans otherwise EPS would have been pretty good, given the virus situation we have. Good management team!"

2020 is the better year. Why are people selling. These Shorts are all over on CNBC.
JPM will be back to $140
JPM CEO know more what could happen and that's why he probably went to hospital for his heart.
"(JPM) losing ground only a sign of market manipulation not to pay for options premium that the clowns of wall street sold, and that's how we make our huge profit guys and nothing you can do about it we control the market Bam,Bam,Bam"
Hopefully we get a nice dividend increase this year.
Buy JPM if you are considering bank stock.

Shouldn’t JPM double the Dividend. They sure are making a lot of money. :-)
My guy says it’s a buy at 100

From the way JPM has been trading you'd think they had an earnings miss!
JPM lost another $3.8 Billion in Market cap today... Dead Cat in a free fall. Even a Dead Kitty bounces a little when it hits the ground. I say up 30-40 cents a share on Friday. That's only because some shorts are covering after making a fortune.
value is $70. So under $100 would be a good speculative buy.

Better by BBBY over JPM why easy BBBY can control it's own dividend JPM will have to cut it's when the government tells them to. BBBY is trading Way under value JPM is not and would have to fall a very long ways before it was even near a value BBBY is now trading at. BBBY still makes money and will make even more per share the more stock BBBY retires. BBBY is a much better value and has a lot more upside than JPM.
"I dont hold JPM shares but I find it odd, actually crazy that it went lower. Had very good results. wow market likes companies that make little to no earnings because they can have a good time for years bragging about growth. They hate money makers like JPM and MU. They love SQ, ROKU, TWLO, AMD stocks that make little to no money so even if they doubled earnings over next year they call that 100% growth and stocks you should buy at 100-200 PE's. They dont like JPM or even MU who makes more than JPM per earnings."

"The Orange Clown is muddying the waters. I believe the Chinese could start selling Treasuries-hard. Instead of a solid bid, to they're detriment, they go offered.

Interesting shuffleing of chairs in the executive suites. Is Dimon setting up for his succession? He had a heart attack not too long ago. Might be close to time for him to back off and retire into a comfortable sunset.
If I understood Sheila Bair correctly on CNBC today: the US Banks should not be paying dividends; because the gov't is supporting the economy and dividend thus being subsidized. Any agreement with her view?

"Great entry point. This will move into the low 100’s with any vaccine clarity. A long term stock like this never goes on sale except every 10 years. This has a potential to be back at 140 in a year and they have been writing so called safe loans. If the defaults happen and they will happen, the collateral will make the banks value much stronger. This is my top pick along with UPS right now. Buy and tick them away for 2-3 years and they will be much higher. Don’t forget the sustainable dividend."

The time to buy is now. In fact it was a couple of hours ago.You'll miss the boat if you are waiting for mid 80s which is similar to March lows.This dropped 10% on news that dont even count for 0.5% of the price.Buy now and sell at +100 in 2-3 weeks

where is the message board?
I think this is going to fall quite a bit lower before going up again. Gonna be looking to build up a position in the coming weeks.
we know FDIC likely will allow buybacks & incresed bank dividends in the near future! Any thoughts on whether that will boast the SP of JPM?
Well that escalated quickly

"It is laughable that Biden says he will work hard for hard working Americans. As Vice President under Obama, he watched Jamie and execs from other companies, and Obama walk away from the Jobs Council. It was disbanded after several months. Obama didn't want US jobs, Jamie didn't, and Biden certainly didn't. They all wanted to use their China connections to make money for the small number of companies with special China relationships. No doubt Jamie has to do everything China says, or they will spill the beans on him. And Joe."

"The financial institutions are in trouble. The write downs/write offs are going to be big and ongoing and the counter party failure for derivatives will threaten the very viability of many of them - which is a domino chain just waiting to collapse. We're all in trouble, but the Fed and other central banks are pulling every string they can to keep it all together. Let's hope they succeed. Even if they do, unfortunately for the old guard, the dark pools providing loans and financing continue to grow and function without the burden of regulation. Times are changing and banks and their brethren, like many parts of the oil business will just shrink and many will fade die. Buffett knows this as do bank execs. I might change my mind if Diamond bought like he did in 2016 and 2018 but its just not happening. Guess why."

JPM is the best bank in the world besides Citi group and Wells Fargo.￼
Fraud Street in action.
Jamie Diamond and half the Upper Management at JP Morgan should be in Jail!! This overpriced overhyped bank should get investigated for some of the practices they Do!!

"So, some old coot finally dies from the flu, and the good squad on Fraud Street throws the engine into reverse overnight, before anyone else can react to it. Unreal. All CA is doing is grabbing as much of Numbnuts Nancy's $8.5 Billion as they can before the crisis is wasted."
Looking cheap. Pnc too
With loans defaulting I feel it will hit 75 to 80 at best. People saying it will go to 50 I don’t think so!
Anyone who understands investing knows this stock is way overvalued.

"""Whatever it takes"" and people are wondering why valuations are so high, this is a big reason. You're going to pay for quality even in so much uncertainty. Whatever it takes to me is putting a insurance policy on the American economy. The FED just slapped an FDIC insurance policy on your brokerage acct. Why you should be taking the hints he gives saying it's ok to buy, I sure did and I'm in the green with no real chance of falling off into fear zone. I feel there should be enough takes to catch on when you should chill. They haven't even passed the 2nd stimulus package yet. So this by no shot is time to sit on bench. You will likely never in lifetime after this hear the FED say ""Whatever it takes"". I'm 40 and never heard them say with so little words."
I agree former President Obama gets the Pinocchio award for the biggest liar ever to live in the White House.1- If you like your health insurance and Dr. with Obamacare you can keep both.2- Benghazi death of 4 Brave Americans was caused by Islamic video. 3- The hundreds of $millions$ Obama spent on green energy companies that went bankrupt was no big deal. 4- The plane load of hundred dollar bills Obama sent to Iran was a good deal. 5- America was never a great country the Obama apology tour.

JPM is approaching a bear market level correction. 142.75 down to 135.45 this is down 5.2% since announcing their earnings. Look for it to drop below 120 in the coming week. This stock will be a loser for the next 6 months. Strong recommendation to sell now and get out.
This company can easily pay off all its debt twice. I don't understand how you can say this stock is overvalued.
JPM remains one of the largest lenders to fossil fuel companies. This is bad for the planet and bad for investors. This must change says the heirs to the Rockefeller fortune: https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c07a418d-5104-3ffb-b68e-1e76963cc50d/mega-banks-should-use-their.html

"buy dips, sell highs today ... the mafia is squeezing shorts we gain"
"Wow, just when JPM reported surprisingly great earnings today, it started tanking. Doesn't seem like people are attracted to good results. Now I'm curious how BAC will do tomorrow."
Why did Dimon give one million dollars to smear group SPLC? Take your business to another bank. Anyone who lines up with smear artists at SPLC is evil.

Anyone hearing $5 for earnings
It’s worse than it looks but they are keeping quiet about the banks exposure here. Music stopped mid dance.Literally the timing couldn’t have been worse. Everyone pulled the trigger and took on debt for capex/innovation/expansion etc because of the very beautiful tax and regulation climate trump created. Now music stopped and fed has to bankroll to pacify and buy time for banks to restructure assets to navigate a contraction. Fed injecting huge amounts to unfreeze credit market while banks kicking up credit stipulations theoretically Freezing the credit markets. It will be a cold market for next couple qtrs until corporate debt risk gets recalculated and mitigated to sustainable levels

"I fail to see why people here think this stock deserves a $100B market cap RIGHT NOW. I am long with 1K shares but even with potential growth in the future and *taking into consideration everything else* (total outstanding shares of 2B, etc.), even with a high premium this stock is fully valued at around $30 (and even slightly overpriced IMHO at $30). Obviously this changes if they can make $10B in annual profit for 5 years straight (and not just one year). But, that is unlikely. FYI - $JPM market cap is about $300B. No reason why a cyclical business (RKT) that focuses primarily on mortgage refinancing should have a market cap close to that of JPM, a top tier bank."
Have never heard of JPM holding any Venezuelan bonds. They could but it would not be a significant amount
JPMORGAN Chase (JPM) is a modern ponzi scheme!This bank has zero value they earn money with fraud. What is wrong with the financial system?

JP Morgan allowed a company to move more than $1bn through a London account without knowing who owned it. The bank later discovered the company might be owned by a mobster on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.... FinCEN Files

We feel these are the strongest players in relevant sectors, with Citigroup being strong but JP Morgan Chase the strongest and Nordstrom the strongest by far in the Retail industry followed a distant 2nd to Macy's which is still a very strong Company and severely beat down Company. We only buy the top 3 Companies in the market."
$120 is the fair value for today
Historically every bank with less than 20% capital failed. JPM has 10%. History is being made. JP is up to his eyeballs in derivatives.
look into buying SPCE its a risky way to become rich. but its favorable look into it.
Jamie Dimon's warning should be taken serious. Fed and stimulating bill temporarily covered the economic damage. The financial system is no longer a capitalism which permits poor companies to bankrupt.
"Amazing how sleezy we can be,we faked (JPM) to over $102.00 and than we sold off as usual , now we can keep all the option premium we sold , average investor never stand a slim chance of ever make any $$$ against the criminal rats of wall street."
"The guidance comes after national outrage over banks such as JPMorgan prioritizing loans to large, public companies over small businesses struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic, which the funds were intended for in the first place. After they got caught, JPMorgan announced that they were working with the Treasury department to adjust the distribution qualifications for the next round of funding. That's nice, but it doesn't help small business owners who continue to struggle amid the pandemic - which resulted in a lawsuit filed last week in a Los Angeles federal court over the debacle."

Some pretty good news about whole financial sector or money flowing from tech to finance.
I didn’t sell my JPMorgan 3 days ago because exdividend dates was April 5. Never base ur selling point on ex div dates.
I posted before this drop that there was a GAP below. If you found it you knew we were going to go this low. Now we are rolling into their quarter posting and the drop will make any dead cat bounce at time of posting look like a support. But they went lower before and any covid or china/tech negatives are in play. Plus volume benchmarks. JPM is a bellweather outside of tech five because it is so broad and missed getting decimated totally in 2008. Moving to Germany? to maintain China back door? No one is talking about that.
WOW first the FBI trying to control our elections and now for sure we know why the FED raising rates so fast to try and cause a recession and now we know why they did not cut enough in July. The FED has been doing all they can to cause a recession just so the DEM wits could win in 2020 WOW. Dudley was right. WOW the DEM wits have corrupted our whole system under Obama.
Stay away from this stock. Biggest lender to declining fossil fuel cos. Stock manipulator.Want a breath of fresh air? Look at renewable energy conversation boards.

"Endless Non-QE QE = Daily Skim / Free, Risk-Free $$$$$$$$ for the Fed's TBTF banks.What’s the practical difference between the Fed buying this directly from the US government and buying it same day it issues from a big bank?Virtually nothing — except the big bank probably took home a very hefty paycheck for conducting this “service” as a middleman. Later JP Morgan, et al., can report magnificent “profits” from their ”trading activities”, which amounted to little more than calling the Fed the week before and asking how many $billions of these Treasury bills they wanted.Just a temporary middleman who, if only skimming a single basis point (1/100 of a percent), would have gotten $400,000 in “trading profits” for holding onto a big pile of government paper for less than a single day, with a guaranteed buyer with infinitely deep pockets already lined up. Great work if you can get it, eh?But not very fair. Nor even remotely in line with the spirit of the Federal Reserve Act. Or what capital markets are supposed to be about.

"@ DWM. This is a question not an attack...I was wondering what you were basing your estimate on. I would love to see 200 lol. However, they have not broken 125 yet and I had a sell in for that price to take a profit. There are several Toms posting on these boards. This one is not a big player. Just a regular guy trying to make a dollar out of 99 cents."
And the fed just cut the banks dividends
"Imagine being a democrat and believe Biden is competent, Hillary was innocent and Obama was a good president......."
I got in on JPM at $98 earlier in the week the day before the Q1 earnings and now this flea is $87. I have another hour to sell before the market close today and take my loss. Hate to buy high and sell low but I don't want to take the risk that this stock will go lot lower in the coming weeks/months.
FED to tighten rates. 1/4% (probably) or even a 1/2%? This creates a guaranteed spread to all US banks and FINALLY benefits fixed income retirees. This will calm inflation but squeeze marginal home buyers and slow median home sales.Money center banks will benefit.We do need to watch yield curve inflection from tightening. Good luck to most...
do you guys trust Jimmy??? i won't
Yes all the banks will rise after earnings think about how much money they made off the sba and ppp loans. Along with the amount of money they are making each day off of trading pick up the top four banks by July 10th-14 and you will be rewarded the banks will be the last entities to really rise before a drop

"Elizabeth Warren has about 50 plans to take wealth away from people who have it. This will now include unrealized capital gains. Meaning if you own a stock, and it goes up, you now owe tax, every year, even if you didn't sell it. hmmm. what if the stock goes down before you sell ? Do you get that tax back ? Many shareholders would be affected by this. Many bank customers would be affected by this. And JPM donates to the far left. JPM is using money garnered by paying low interest rates to customers, donates to the left, gets a tax deduction, and taxpayers have to make up for that deduction. JPM is boinking the country. And yet you stay invested, and you have a bank account. Both of which are being used to take away your hard earned money. Can't you grasp that ??????"

I bet you that JPM will rise up more than $.60 by the close because GS is the guarantee for the financial stock at this moment. The market makers accumulate the shares for the big boys.
Wow I thought the stock would climb to $144 - $145 yet it’s only up $2.50 premarket. I guess it’s to high already. You will see profit taking today !!
JPM and Goldman sacks just got slammed on the stress test and are going back to the FED's over something even though all 35 did pass.
"Sure. He's a genius.Jack Whoare37 minutes ago$WFC conversationI literally doubled my stock account's value between March - May in WFC alone. I traded it with several different strategies while it was collapsing and rising in massive volatility back then. It was easy, I over leveraged options to do so, took some major risk obviously but it really isn't that risky when the RSI is at multi decade lows. I got out for good of the market at the end of May securing my massive profits. I now am convinced that I will get another opportunity to buy/trade a massive volatile market between now and Sept. I believe WFC and many other stocks will hit fresh lows soon for the ""final time"" before a meaningful recovery takes hold, Trump wins in November, and off to the races long term.I will lol if I double my account yet again.

JPM is down 6.91% to 106.10
I would still not put one dime in any big bank. Why because they can not control their own fate and are run by the Government. After the last 2 tonight's debate it would scare the blank out of me to invest in any bank run by the Government. They are not safe and will trade at a discount to the market. Because they banks are not in total control whether they can or can not pay their dividend and the Government will cut the dividends of all banks at any sign of a major slow down or recession. Just the way it is now with our banking system. Right I think I am so smart Jamie
Watch out below if this breaks below 90. Support is about to be lost. Back to 85 real quick tomorrow if it does break below 90 today.
the safest tremendously undervalued stock at the moment

Biden/Warren 2020. Banks won’t be able to get away with shenanigans. Sell!
Dimon is the greatest....he'll tell u so too.
Fed just announced to replace 4 WFC board members and restrict growth. Is it good for other banks?
"Jamie Dimon is a scam artist like Bernie Madoff. 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl total BS. JPM paid nearly $44 billion to date in fines for mortgage fraud to avoid prosecution without admitting guilt. The Banksters are responsible for the ""Great Recession"" which has lead to the Great Wealth Gap Fraud. Now we have $ billions paid to the TBTF banks daily keepING this ponzi scheme going because of the world debt crisis and insolvent banking system ie, Deutsche Bank...and their bonuses just keep on rolling!"
As a former JPM employee I hated Jamie Dimon for letting me go back in 2009 but I sure love what my 401k is doing…
"The Fed will be buying JPM stock before the Summer ends. The Fed will use this crisis to seal complete control of the US just as the ECB controls Europe and BoJ controls Japan. While we are playing defense, the Fed and its Central Bank pals are salivating. This pandemic will be known as the event that changed control of the USA from the 3 branches of government to the Federal Reserve. Governments will continue to dissolve into Bread and Circuses shows just as they did in the Roman Empire; within the next 5 years the Federal Reserve will hold all the power in this country."
"I have been waiting for a pullback for a while, I think we are in the early stages of that developing."

"Oops.@@@JPMorgan Chase & Co’s top boss, Jamie Dimon, on Monday said he sees a “bad recession” in 2020, and that the largest U.S. bank could suspend its dividend if the coronavirus crisis deepens. Dimon, widely regarded as the face of the U.S. banking sector, is the most prominent voice on Wall Street so far to project that the economic cost of the coronavirus will not evaporate quickly, and said the bank’s earnings will be down “meaningfully in 2020.”https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/us-business/article-dimon-says-jpmorgan-may-suspend-2020-dividend-over-coronavirus-crisis/"
"They're expecting serious credit defaults. Get ready for a very bumpy road for JPM. Great company, but get ready to buy in around $80 or less. This bear market hasn't reached the bottom yet. People are hoping for a speedy, smooth, recovery, but it won't be. Unemployment has rocketed to uncharted territories and it will take a while to see those jobs returning. People and businesses will be defaulting, absolutely. Be patient and listen to the experienced people saying this isn't over yet."
"Recently, JPM announced it will stop lending money to coal, and to Alaska oil development. Meaning they feel they can discriminate against whomever they please. In the future, due to hateful people, they will stop lending to wealthy people, and later, they will stop lending to males, and later they will stop lending to conservatives. For you see, if you are the perceived cause of the problem, you are not tolerated and must be silenced or eliminated."
Warren Buffett loves the banking stocks.
"Banks will have large increases in net interest margins as long interest rates rise. It's pretty simple. Short-term deposits rates are stuck at about zero fixing their costs at a bottom. Long-term, variable rate loans will rise and increase revenues. Widening spread will result in rising profits for banks. If inflation does pick up this year, net interest margins will increase even more. Next few years will be fantastic for bank profits."
why the bank so down today?
"While not a member of the NRA, I do agree with most of its ideals.

Awesome. JPM has started it's Buybacks. We can expect them to spend about 2.5 Billion a month. Alongside blue wave and janet yellen. Big banks are going to consolidate complete power/dominance over the next few years.

it can't take it that now one is talking about this resent decline as typical mid term election minipulation #$%$. 82% of companies have beat third quarter estimates so far. Banks are sitting boarder line record liquitity as rates are raising providing more of a spread to profit on. Caterpillar reported best quarter ever!!!. All companies are making huge money with a record low unemployment. The data that started this recent decline needs to analyzed better to look into manipulation. It baffles me how it is possible but I beleive it is somehow manipulated with democratic ties

very low volume..no conviction selling just profit taking...
Diamond will make billions off Trump virus programs

"Don't worry, we knew nothing about it. (')US authorities in Philadelphia seized a cargo vessel in June with nearly 20 tons of cocaine on board. The ship, as it turns out, is owned by a fund run by banking giant JPMorgan Chase.A source close to the situation said on Wednesday that the ship, the MSC Gayane, is part of a transportation strategy fund run for the bank's asset management unit.That means JPMorgan Chase (JPM) does not have any operational control of the vessel, a Liberian-flagged ship that is run by the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company. The bank had no comment.Law enforcement agents boarded the MSC Gayane on June 17 and found the cocaine, which is said to have a street value of about $1.3 billion."

"tax cut will help companies save a lot of money, SO companies have enough money to make stronger price war, no inflation maybe forever, the bank stock need update at least one year, the bank need Fed reduce it's debt and rise rate more times to boost mortgages rate rise, but this unclear,"
"It's not a bad idea to add more shares ahead of interest rate hike in about 2 weeks, IMHO"
Can’t touch this right now
JPM reached a 52 Week low at 83.70
Don’t even look at the futures price of silver this is totally fake what it’s all about is physical metal they can put any number on this they want but the bottom line is whatever number they put out there the physical price is going to be a lot more this is their game drive the price of the metal down in a paper market what really matters is if you don’t hold it you don’t on it is that right Jamie.
"Heres what scary! If JPM meets or is close to in line, it will go up, if it misses it will go up because the excuse will be the data is backwards looking......I'm a total contrarian on this market. That said everything will go up until it just collapses. It should now but I don't know when or whats the trigger. I think their is too much money out there ready to buy any dip."
If JPM isn’t down today after that ER. Then the FED completely has taken over and now owns the markets.
we’ll see a 1$ up on opening
Will the dividend be cut ?
How about a 3 for 1 stock split?----now
Deutche Bank new 52 week low 4 th time in 6 days really tanking now they say this is the most important bank in the financial system and has tentacles into all wall st banks (DB) look

Signed up to (http://Rightpicker.com) last month and instantly saw why my trading buddy has been banking so many winners. She tried to fly under the radar but the secret is out. Join them today.
Here is another stock that is way better than JPM that will need to cut its dividend . Start picking up some IP pays 5% and all they need to do is cut some of that top heavy management and IP will be back over $50 in a flash.
Announced pref dividend only no ordinary dividend. That has impacted the afternoon session price move

"With shares heading upwards right now, thought I'd start the question: With JPM being at or over $100 price point since Nov. 2017 (almost 2 years), has anyone heard anything about a stock split?? ""2 years over $100"" seems like it has been the point where splits have happened in the past. Or in today's market, $110/share isn't that big of a deal??Thoughts?"
no split in sight.they will increase dividend and reduce share count
The stock market is green thanks to JPM earnings report
Stress test will make JP cut dividend and they'll make more money while the shareholders continue to lose!
$100 in 2017?
"high salary, economic slowdown and no inflation, most of business are no money make ,so Fed will cut rate to 0, all bank stock are not worth to buy,"
"I saw on varney this morning, that some nat gas is hard to move, due to limited infrastructure. That some natural gas is being Given Away, and some gas, they are paying people to come and pick it up. WHy would JPM fund nat gas fracking, when they aren't getting any money for some of the drilling ? why do they continue drilling ? I use to think US producers were smarter than Saudi producers. Now I know many of them are not. How much money does JPM lend to drillers ? Its billions my friends."
"JPM rep WAS KICKED OUT OF GE BOD IN 2016.. Soon after JPM STARTED MANIPULATING GE PRICE, AND THE REVENGE ATTACK STARTED ON GE, Toosa L1AR DAILY DOWNGRADE.. Look at the chart, down trend since 2016 about the time JPM rep was KICKED OUT OF GE Bd..GE SHOULD FILE $$500 BILLION DAMAGE CLAIM.."
Time for this stock to split.
"My $95s seem to be holding. Fed on hold. Back and fill trading builds a base to work from. Still a core blue chip holding, with a fortress balance sheet. Maybe 10% undervalued short term, imho. IPOs delayed revs..."

"JPM - 52 Week High $142.75 JPM - Premarket Thursday, Jan 21st $135.82 5% correction The share price is now down $6.93 per share JPM has lost a staggering $21.1 Billion in Market Cap in just 3 trading days. The crazy bad part of this is that the DOW has been up every day during JPMs free fall. As an example of just how bad this is, if the DOW was to drop 5% in 3 trading days it would have to lose approximately 530 points a day for three days straight."
How are those call options doing ?
"I have been long since 83 bucks , nice dividend to boot , my sell price is 112 and if I get that my house will be paid for ! That is my exit strategy like anybody cares"
JPM will fly high in 2018 and beyond..and..stay tuned for 3-1 split....
JP Morgan once said before he passed away to Congress silver and gold or money and everything else is credit do you get it?
International loans will default too. It will be worst than financial crisis in Europe and Asia.

Why does everyone hate Trump? He is getting the job done.
"So wait, is Dimon now the national spokesman for the trade war with China? He just told CNBC that they will agree on enough to extend the trade deadline past March 1st. How does he know that? Sources? You gotta love how these guys never say ""in my opinion"" this will happen, and they expect everyone to embrace to their opinion."
How is releasing reserves considered earning anything? Taking money from the piggy bank rainy day fund and stuffing it in ones wallet doesn't equate to generating income. How long can JP keep draining their rainy day fund before it runs out?
How much does share buyback help the stock price? Increase EPS?
LONG term buy will be around 68
POWELL soon to get fired by Trump.
JPM is still cheap imho
"So now the millennials are scared about the virus. They say they are getting tested in record numbers and going to the hospital for treatment. The strange thing is that there is not a significant rise is ICU stays. They are now clogging the hospitals because they never faced adversity. With twitter and facebook I find this generation a ""me"" generation and they do what is good for them. They protest to get that viral video, they break the rules because being rebel is adored and do what they want because it about them. All this coddling has led to a weak generation that has no leadership."

Still too expensive
Monday breakout?
"Out today at $140 with profit, it doesn't seem to be able to get over the previous high of about $142."
Studying this all weekend and listen to JC today on CNBC JP Morgan going down on Friday made no sense. I get the sell off to take profits but it should not continue this week! The numbers were great and I am confident investors this week will realize that. Only trade 13 times earnings when a company like proctor gamble trades at 21. Meanwhile there is less risk and more growth at JP. I personally feel we this this stock go to 130 sooner then Later. But what do I know. Time will tell!
JPM to 120 soon
Msft is normally cheaper than Jpm. not any more
Gold and silver are starting to move in Opposite directions from the stock market this is just the beginning just wait till all the small businesses try to get their loans approved what a nightmare here it is Friday afternoon and my wife is in line at the grocery store everything is just about sold out and the The lines are enormous the reset of this economy has started within a year we will have a new Currency but at a much less value watch and see

"why AMZN could control CPI ???because investors continue buy, Amazon share holders make stock money, they don't need make business money, Amazon on line store lost huge money, but Amazon continue cut price, because investors continue buy AMZN, SO no inflation forever, no inflation the bank stock won't rise, because no inflation mortgages rate won't rise too, SO bank stock will go down if investors continue support AMZN, if AMZN rise to $2000 per share, the bank stock will go down 50percent of now,"

what do you guys think about the fed having to pump 75 billion into the banking system to keep liquidity from freezing
Dimon warns on 'much uncertainty' - ... sure
Banks are smart. They will put a floor interest rate on loans and will make money wherever the fed rate goes. I know as I have loans that have a floor of 5%. No matter what the fed rate is

Bad loans - Not sure what's going on, one side there are articles about consumers carrying low balances on credit cards, business loans and Chapter-11 etc is unknown, but overall I think this is priced in.4. Inflation & interest rate - I think these two will work in favor of JPM.5. Don't buy and keep watching the price fluctuation. Buy and forget it. or Keep accumulate if price falls down.

JPM in danger of a death cross today. 50 day struggling to stay above the 200 day SMA.
"How about the World Bank, once a world leader in corruption and money laundering, now lending billions to China, at very low interest rates. The best thing I guess, is that the World Bank is using US taxpayer money, and that money taken from us, can't be used to repay JPM loans. And JPM can't lend those billions to China, and is missing out on some nice investments there. Attention bankruptcy lawyers. if your client can't pay, perhaps you can use the argument that JPM loves and enables China, and that its partially JPM's fault that your client can't repay their JPM loan. Its worth a try. And your 2nd argument is, ""why should my client have a top priority to repay their JPM loan, when JPM says that honoring their fiduciary agreement they made to their shareholders is only their 6th priority."" Its worth a try. Its true."
JPM IS GOING HIHGER 160 TO 165 IN VEIW
Is there anyway possible that we can actually break $100 before close. It’s would have to be a massive rally before close
People like tech and NASDAQ better than banks. Jimmy Dimon may be bias when calling it undervaluation.
"Go ahead and make the mistake of pushing JPM down lower and lower to yield nearly 4%+ with a dividend cap on it. it’s going to look mighty nice in a few years for long term holders. best bank in the business and I say that as an employee of another universal bank but facts are facts. All financials will struggle short term, no doubt, but if you’re a long term investor, I think you look at this as just a bump in the road. On the flip side, they can build their balance sheets in other areas or add to loan loss provisions to remain safe for the long term."

"The United States government and Obama administration has yet to produce evidence tying the Russian government to a purported hacking operation meant to undermine the 2016 presidential election. This is despite reports from journalists stating the contrary.Bloomberg reported Thursday, “Prodded to produce evidence by Russia, which has denied a role in hacking — and by an openly skeptical President-elect Donald Trump — the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security did so Thursday.” Other outlets such as PC Magazine and the International Business Times also interpreted the Joint Analysis Report (JAR) issued by the DHS and FBI as evidence tying Russia to a hacking operation.The report, however, is devoid of evidence linking Russia to hackings of Democratic Party institutions and individuals. The report broadly describes how “two separate Russian espionage groups” were involved in the “the intrusion into a U.S. political party.” But there’s no specific details explaining the attribution of Russia as being behind the hacking. Eight pages of the report consist of information meant to help network administrators try and identify possible intrusions, prevent them, and what to do if they identify code the U.S. government has identified as Russian.Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/02/the-us-has-yet-to-provide-evidence-russia-directed-a-hacking-operation-to-undermine-election/#ixzz4UbdeIJAF"

"this COVID -19 is not as severe as what people think it is due to media:1) the death rate of COVID-19 has been inflated EXCEPT Russia. As russian doctors say, ""the cause of death is NOT COVID-19 but due to the complication of several health issues (like asthma or heavy smoking)"". In other words, COVID-19 is not going to affect healthy individuals. As long as we take necessary supplements aka vitamins and drinking enough water daily, we are good.2) Shutting down businesses don't stop this virus getting spread and has NOTHING to do with getting spread. Does government think that people who had many health issues were the main traffic of all these local businesses in the past? This is a joke - people who go to gym all the time wont be the target. Banks? where people communicate over the glass window? They must be kidding.Here is what the government should do immediately:- Any shopping mall/movie theater will have a testing spot at the entrance like a metal detector.- Provide necessary vitamins to individuals from grocery stores for free (like flu shots).- Keep providing $1k check to individuals until the private investment activities come up to last 4th Qtr.- Provide N95 mask to individuals with health issues for free.- Bail out travel related such as airlines, oils, banks, mortgages, diners via issuing government-backed trust preferred stocks (remember Y2007-2009 when banks issue preferred stocks?)- increase tariff amounts for Chinese goods for the damage occurs and to offset the tax loss for the government.IF this doesnt work, let employees can work 4 days per week and 3 days as weekends - what I'm trying to say is to let the economy vehicle rolling without a sudden stop for nothing."

any comments on bank earning next week. (JPM)
"While Dimon is correct this country has myriad of problems they are all caused by globalism and democrats. Just look at Georgia as the latest example. Votes democrat and immediately is rewarded with lost revenues and boycotts. The cancer in this country is the democrat party. The further left the country goes the worse of the lower classes go. That is a fact that is indisputable. You simply can not be stupid and listen to corporate media if you want to solve any of these problems. You need to TOSS these loser politicians, of all races, and start focusing on work, values and the truth, something the democrat party reviles."
"According to Yahoo chart there was a buy order trade for 415,000 shares at 3:59 pm. Must be some good news maybe to be released after hours maybe about the stress test results."

DEM witted Tax and green policies only cause the poor and middle class to have more and more rationing on them. Soon everything in California will be rationed to the poor the rich will always have the money to buy what the need and the poor and middle class always pays the highest price. Water is rationed , electricity is rationed, Gas is rationed , Soon food will be rationed and fee are put on things they don't want you to buy. Pizza Hut now has a FEE, Paint nas a FEE., Lumber has a FEE, Soon the higher priced pet food will have a FEE, Donuts will have a FEE, Burgers will have a FEE.. For sure California is not the land of the free unless you have been in slaved to the freeloader system and given your live up to be poor.. it's the land of the FEE until the DEM wits in slave you to.."
China may go up 50% next year imho ... huge!

JPM just made a few hundred million on IBM/RHT deal.
How will the SLV short squeeze effect the current price if JP Morgan has to cover its short positions? Looks like a short squeeze is happening on Monday. You have been warned....
"Going to park this at $95 options expiration today, haha don't short!"
JPM is still a better bet rather than putting money under a mattress. I like it because I have 750 shares and it has pretty good dividens that help make this a good choice.
"JPM has 16,000 employees in Great Britain. It is a fact, that JPM will have to help Great Britain with its swelling immigration numbers, estimated to drive their population to over 70 million by 2028. A prudent investor will have to allow for any company having operations in great Britain being taxed for desalinization plants, sewer plants, hospitals, housing, doctors. schools. Since many large companies want and lobby for, and contribute for lots of people coming in a country, to keep wage costs low, it is prudent to expect companies that benefit from low wages to pay for some on the civil problems they are helping to create."
Rumor on the street one large leveraged bank is in trouble! Could it be JPM?

JPM = huge buying opportunity!!!!!
Buy banks
Mary q so much for resistance at $125
JPM IS ON FIRE GREAT TIME TO BUY BEFOR IT HIT 160
Remember this is no longer a free market!
Lower yield curve means lower profits for banks. Banks are in trouble Sell while you can
1/5/2021---Seaport Global Advisors raises the price target for JPM from $125 to $140.
DON'T THINK BANK EARNINGS WILL BE GOOD.

This crooked company always big beat and stock doesn’t really move
"So a Bitcoin position has been made, the passcode eventually becomes lost, the Bitcoin position becomes inaccessible and goes to never-never land. If 90% of that Bitcoin becomes lost forever like this, who would buy into the remaining 10%? Does that lost 90% form a bottom base? Do it's creators expect lost passcodes and simply wait? Interesting way the Treasury could pay off the national debt with a coin of their own, withthe forfeited account values based on people's eventual bad luck and bad passcode memories. Same as destroyed money, whatever accounting ledger holds never-never be cash again. Musical chairs with tulip greed, when does a coin stop trading & move into oblivion? JPM coin anyone?"
I would think the candidate that would have the balls to take on credit card companies charging consumers extremely high interest rates would get my vote. Does not matter what party your affiliated with its criminal behavior to try and hurt people or prey on there financial situation.
"Banks like JPM and Citi will do well going forward given the excellent housing numbers that came out today and huge sale increases at Home Depot, Lowes, Lumber Liquidator, Bast Buy (see their stock prices today), et al. The chains are making huge money and those credit cards are getting used like never before. Time to buy the cheap money center banks!"
Maxine Waters and her AOC team will be at their typical nastiest best today. Don't know why these banker CEO's subject themselves to voluntary abuse. I would say No thanks.
Long on banking...
"they just raised their credit requirements to 700 to buy a house and 20% down. If you want to buy a 300,000 dollar house they want to make sure you have a good amount of money in the bank and that you pay.They obviously know the economic environment will be horrible in the near future.You simply cant expect them to give good news tomorrow."
"ER next week..........do we run up to $108 going into ER and if good numbers do we get above $112-$114 resistance. I do not see a path to $120 in this current market, that is stressing banks. Thumbs Up if we get to $108-$110 or Thumbs down if we fall back into the mid-low $90's."
....see you over 115$ before earnings.....easy
"JP Morgan now holds 133.1 million ounces of physical silver and the world record for most silver held under one name. Today, it also owns 50% of the world's COMEX silver bullion."

Pelosi continues to tease us. Time's up.
It’s all good. Fed raises on Wednesday and JPM does the slow roll to $120. :-)
The democratic party in the bank stole the election but we will make silver or monetary metal that it was meant to be all patriots your job is to buy physical silver whatever you can afford within your means do so at all costs and never sell it hang onto it forever pass it on to your kids your grandkids and your great great grandkids this is 300 years of generational wealth that you should be worried about
"JPM in for a crash landing Why because the board needs to fire I think I am so smart Jamie for voicing his opinion and bashing the President , Why because it has no place in or banking system. Our banks need to be for all Americans and not for only ones that the CEO views spread and it spreads like a cancer in the bank far and wide."
Comments on today's move? imo fears of lost revenue on credit card now reversed because of huge opportunity with government backed small business loans. With of course surprise catching shortg holders. Suddenly banks look much better.
see you at 120....marching 125 -earnings.....easy
I have two friends that are airline pilots and both of them shifted half their 401(k)s over in the self-directed IRA‘s they all bought physical metals this is happening more and more people were several million dollars in retirement accounts are buying physical metals that are stored allocated to just them. Everyone wants out of the dollar they don’t know all the answers but what they do know is something stinks and they’re going to protect themselves the best they know how.
"I have been making back a fair amount of my losses every day by shorting JPM around 3:15 pm EST. then covering at 3:58 pm est just before the close, Its worked like a charm for the past 7 trading sessions and I crushed it today"

JPM just had their credit losses exploded from a quarterly average of about 1.5B to 8.2B which basically cut their net earnings by 67%. And that's after only 1 month out of the quarter being really bad. Fed will never let them fail and Jamie Dimon said he's committed to the dividend unless GDP contracts by 35%. If buying in be sure to do a Risk Analysis first. https://invest.smartstops.net/how-it-works/analyze-investment-risk/

looks like banks are going down the drain this quarter

So many facilities, hospitals and nursing homes need improvement work. Summer time is the best season in a year for massive home improvement activities!"
JPM...should easily top $170 this year..and a nice divy increase coming...along with buy backs....stay long..in the most growth potential bank of them all!!!!
Trump all touigh talk - but he is affraid of the Russians - you can sence it/ The show this weekend will be just that symbolic - Russians saying the war with US is possible - you don't hear Trump addressing it - Tough talk o twitter - sad story here
Liberals a a funny bunch they will destroy their own wealth to try and hurt the President.
"governments debt going up will need lower rate to pay it's debt in future, if governments budget deficit decline, the government cut bond sales, the bank make money will decline, how ever anything hurt bank, so bank stock will decline, only inflation can save bank, but inflation need population growth, but population no growth now, so bank stock have 75% DOWN."
This is embarrassing! The Dow is up 2.13% while JPM a dismal 0.57% increase for the day after reporting significantly higher-than-expected profits for Q2 2020. The CEO should be fired! No Leadership what so ever.
This company can't make money without manipulation like Goldman
"I bought JPM shares when it hit 80 and BAC when they hit 19.JPM will be 175 by the end of 2022 and BAC will be about 39.Add 11 dividend payments and the gains will be around 125% in 31 or 32 months.Other bets give you more true, but it's always smart to have a good portion of the money in safer places."

"Government surge in borrowing is pushing up long rates. Now they want an infrastructure bill so more borrowing. Businesses are opening up from virus and borrowing. As long rates drift higher, banks make higher interest rate margins. Pretty easy to figure this out."
"I’m not all that familiar with JPM but at 15 times P/E, 3.10% yield and it’s the top holding (Ahead of Microsoft and Apple) in the DGRO ETF (US Dividend Growth). I think its interesting that JPM is getting into bitcoin (Based only on the title of some articles I have seen) also some of the big banks are getting into IPO & Robinhood and I’m sure their teams will school whatever solo traders can accomplish."

US back to work in May. Covid-19 goes away. JPM up from here.
idk what you guys are on about. i think it is a fine sign... market is up JPM is conditioning itself to be able to up trend post earnings
JPM STOCK EXPLODING BECAUSE OF ALL THE MERRILL LYNCH CUSTOMERS VOWING TO LEAVE ML BECAUSE THEIR SERVICES STINK: WEBSITE ALWAYS GOING DOWN.......... I AM MOVING ALL MY CASH TO JPM AS WELL.
To bad no banks are now investable. Why because they are run by the Government and can have their dividends cut at anytime. Not one bank . Not even JPM controls their own dividend. The Government will tell them every year weather them have to cut or can raise their dividend. Any signs of slow down don't be surprised is the banks have to cut their dividends. Just the system we have now after 2008.
"Pay attention all the stocks that are having a great Q1 are being driven down buy the big investors they are trying to shake everyone out so they hit bottom. Then the buybacks from the tax cuts will kick in and they will all be buying back in. This will begin after Q2. If you are a believer in the stock you own, don’t get upset people this is the time to stay long. The big investors want to get in on the bottom as well. The Dow will begin to surge again and with the new money added to the market it will hit 27,000 and surpass by this time next year. Good luck for now, telling it like it is Happy hunting, JD."
Forecast were already dropped big time and they cant even reach it bhahahaha

Did you know the information from your transactions on 3rd party broker sites like e-Trade is sold to the same direct brokers on the other side of your options positions? I guess I understand why JPM bought E-Trade now, data being the new oil and all. Anyway, in a Trump administration and a retail investing boom, I am starting to become highly suspicious of the role of 3rd party brokerage sites in the broader manipulation going on in the US Stock Exchange."

"does this mean higher interest rates on treasuries in the future ?Executives point out that the pain from coronavirus is far from over, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. has cautioned that it might have to shun customer deposits if tougher rules are reinstated. Analysts have also said recent bouts of wild trading in the $21 trillion Treasury market could be tied to concerns that banks will be forced to hold less government debt, even selling some of their holdings.“We estimate the potential for about $200 billion in Treasury selling, with the potential for it to be even larger,” said BMO Capital Markets strategist Dan Krieter. He added that the outlook remains “extremely uncertain” because it’s not clear what banks’ capital demands will be going forward.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/business/economy/federal-reserve-bank-leverage.html"

Financials fell out of favor for numbers of months. They are in better shape, more capitalized than ever before since 2009 crash. Health of most 5 big banks is safe and sound. Wall Street is continuously mocking banks for 1 reason or the other to no avail.Any reasonable explanation as to what it will take for banks to appreciate in share priceThank You in advance."
Time to get out of this stock and buy it back after a week when things cool down
Why is JPM down so much? Any news? So confused as just saw Zacks giving JPM a strong buy rating.

JPM beats and the stock goes down. What gives
In case you haven't figured out Pelosi's plan yet. She has no intention of agreeing to any stimulus deal before the election. She wants the stock market to crash and the economy to crash so she can get her man in the Oval Office.
The crash like 2008-09 be started with Bank sell off.

JPM now is in the value investor views. Major buys will push this much higher into the 120 range in 30-60 days. Transfer from tech and consumer to value and JPM is the top value pick for hedge funds and institutions.
Gimme all your money bulls

Strongest bank out there. Quarterly financials exceeded expectations. Over $100 and beyond soon in my opinion!

"For those shorts lamenting that a big earnings miss should mean a big share drop, you may not be reading beyond the main headline number. Earnings ""missed"" because of a large chunk of money moved to provisions for future losses. If JPM goes red today, it is because of future projections not current earnings. From Zacks: ""Results included provision builds owing to deterioration in the macro-economic backdrop, losses related to funding spread widening on derivatives and bridge book markdowns. After excluding these, earnings per share were $2.89."""

JPM = $120 before earnings..and $125+ afterwards...and split coming...2-1...
The banks are too hot not to get in on. They're going to continue to outperform this year and will ride the recovery/reopening wave with the rates increasing. Better to just buy the banks instead of try and time them because they are on fire. JPM and BAC are going to be the winners here and in the future.
Buy back of Shares combined with the increased dividend plus passing the stress test is a big catalyst for JPM. $120 buy the end of the year.
I am so disappointed in my investment choice. Sorry guys. Just expect more in pre market. Like Pepsi. Those who think buy backs and dividend increase mean anything are in for a awaking. There are many companies doing that.hope I am wrong.

"Interesting article about the Aramco IPO. You know, the one where JPM promised them to deliver maximum value, while lending money to shale oil companies that help keep oil prices down. Anyway, JPM has another problem on their hands. When they assist the IPO, and help push people to buy the stock, it should be known, per Fortune Magazine, that no one knows their current oil reserves. Allegedly its 260.8 billion recoverable. They are telling people when its listed, they will divulge the real numbers. Shouldn't JPM be demanding the numbers be released before hand ? This is going to be a fiasco. And I am LMAO watching it unfold as both sides sock it to the other. Sadly, thousands of shareholders will be the real victims."

Great to see JPM up nearly $4 today… but still way undervalued It should be trading at $100 or above.
So protests started 3 weeks ago and every city has a spike in cases. So I guess protesting over safety is acceptable. So why is anyone fretting closing the economies. Also average median age is.lowered as all these protestors get the virus.
"Just happened I spent my day watching CNBC all day today. What got me thinking was all the repetitive market analyses from all the money managers and traders that appeared there all day. I certainly get it, the pressures clients can place on them are vast. For it is the typical investment ideas one knows and recognizes as his/her own that dictates the norms that are to be followed. Ideas of how they are meant to be, act, and react, are almost always established by the roles they are expected to play, set and communicated to their clients from their very early years, 20, 30, 40 years ago…Under such light, the question of how these money managers fit in a market place which has changed so much and is still changing every year is an unavoidable question to have. For how can one be part of this brand-new investment world and we see nothing new about them? Thankfully, there was one analysis I watched which I liked. It was $JPM ‘s Kolanovic-head of derivatives and quantitative strategies. He was great at conveying a number of ideas and themes, but perhaps the most prominent was his use of such realism devices as his knowledge of all aspects that move markets today. Whether it’s fundamental, behavioral, technical or CTA’s (momentum plays). Marko was the antidote to the managers that are stuck in past generations. In this environment, one needs to realize, having the knowledge of all players that move markets is in fact a very powerful “weapon” to have. Marko is certainly not the only one but a minority in today’s investment world. By all accounts, to me, Marko, is considered an expert in this investment world and that is accentuated further when juxtaposed with the old-fashioned managers who are not."

"When Trump holds his press conference, wouldn't be surprised if he provided huge support for US oil. His voter base is huge there, can't look weak in front of the russians, and needs to prop market back up. Once he announces any oil stimulus, JMP will go roaring past 105"
"Don't feel lured to banks. There are many issues that you do not see in today's earnings. First and foremost the banking business is about giving loans. Loans to airlines, loans to cruise, entertainment, consumer, auto's offices, real estate, massive loans to fast foods and restaurants, etc. Non of these businesses are doing well and as the quarter progress we will hear warnings after May 25th. So bewary in the coming days we could see JPM at 70 or lower, but actual FAIR VALUE for now is $55 or lower. This is a global issue and I heard that they could have huge lending and investments in foreign countries that is going to do worst for more than 5 years as global recession proceeds. Some of those loans might have to be let go."

Why does a bank that's been around for some 220 years still have a P/E in the double digits? It shouldn't take some 12-13 years for me to make back my investment. Especially when just one guy pulls down $31 million in comp.
"JPM is one of largest companies in the world. More thant 2.5 trillion in total assets. Ford Motor weighs in at $250 billion. So JPM is 10 times bigger than Ford! JPM is global and leader in industry. No US or global economic recovery happens without them. If you believe the economy will someday recover, JPM stock price will too. Current price is so short term. Are investors really this short sighted? Amazing lack of fundamentals. Should price on expected future cash flows over an extended period of time. Not a few months. Just saying."

We should be looking for an increase in the dividend to 75 a quarter cents minimum. Other wise the money will be squandered on useless Fin tech investments and hundreds of new branches. like there is a shortage of bank branches across this country?
Why this sudden push?
This stock headed to 200 a share.
JPM is definitely a buy right now. start to add it
As long as the stock stays between 114.00 and 115.00. Just sit back and collect the dividend

Let me guess JPM is still FIXING the precious metals market.
earning is probably not good
But not a mention of a forward split (a non economic event).Are those who have been hoping for a split doing okay?Enjoy the heat and the weekend!
Bank stocks are the hit buy. They are all rising high today. With oil going higher banks make more money. It’s a win. Money is flowing into banks watch for new 52 week highs in a week
Investors worried about banks. Will JPM go down to $80 or $50?
Sell JPM shares. It is significantly over valued with a 6 - 8 month price target of $65.
Warren Buffett has just bought Barrick Gold I guess his father that wrote that article about the importance of gold and what it means to the people he’s finally getting it and so will the people in this country like JP Morgan shed so many years ago gold is money and everything else is credit There is only one better investment and that is silver and you are a know that very well JP Morgan

We also started a small position in AB yield under $25, yield over 11%, enough said. We took profits on this one also.We added a little RCBC and a bunch of AMRB under $11.50 when someone dumped some this week.LBC we also added a little more.The easy money this week is over now this past week in the larger names, all bounced very nice.

GE AVIATION is CROWN-JEWEL of USA and the world, it's nearly MONOPOLY, by far the highest quality, most reliable, India Russia China switching from RR and PW engines that have constant technical issues grounding..As if that was not enough, GE PAID off $50+ BILLION debt/pension, still sitting on MOUNTAIN of CASH $47 BILLION+ $30 BILLION abroad China, India, Asia, EU, M.East, S.America, Africa,+ $30 BILLION line of credit UNTOUCHED..Only because of JPM Convoluted MANIPULATION of GE price, Toosa & Markapolos misinformation GE is being kept dirt low by JPM Market Makers.. GOOGLE it, JPM removed replaced their stock Market maker because JPM stock CRASHED temporarily back in 2016 along with market..

This kind of bad actions by JPM Toosa & Markapolos hurts USA influence, financial superpower role around the world, and aids China and others to catch up to USA Businesses..By the way, no disrespect to JPM, I love JPM just as I love and respect GE, because what is good for GE is good for USA, is good for all of us.. This is more important than ever with conflicts rising with China.. I seems like JPM brains are lacking to understand the whole picture, someone needs to sit-down with JPM, and clean the house, get in long-term brains in, and get rid of Toosa & Markapolos type LYING C0NTS, Convoluted short visioned little CR00KS.."

#JPM Volume is good. Undervalued based on the P/E at stoxline. Looking for breakout at 115.15 with a short term target of 134.50.
Looks like $110 tomorrow
Silver is your Achilles’ heel and people know it the federal reserve and it’s federal reserve note are useless paper like the name that your company that you represent JP Morgan said so many years ago to Congress silver and gold or money and everything else is credit when this credit bubble blows up you’re going to see trillions of dollars vanish and thin air The run to gold and silver has just started and especially silver.
Jpm bank is only gonna go up from here trade wars don’t seem like they’re a big concern especially since the likelihood of it affecting us in a negative way is very small if they do.
Looking exactly like 2008 Did!!
Break out to 110

Sector rotation from bubble tech to financials will keep JPM moving higher. Noticed they are underwriting lots of offerings now. $130?
Silver now stands at $18.61 we are getting closer to that magic number of $21 that’s when the door is kept wide open and run to $50 happens very quickly

Jamie's heart attack was no coincedence!
"Sorry folks, dead cat falling just continued right through cement, it's now headed to the subways... Down another $1.75 premarket for yet another market cap loss of approximately $5.42 Billion dollars. This brings the total market cap loss in just the past 5 trading days to a MIND BENDING -BREATHTAKING $30.1 Billion Dollars. To give you an idea of how much this is, Ford Motor Co. current market cap is $45 Billion,"
Hoping this tanks big today. I sold when it went over $100. Would like to get in under $100.
-51% profit loss q2 from year befoure and is going to be much wors! WOW-5% today
When JPM hit high 90s it looked right to grab some cheap 101 and 102 calls. Blew them forward today into the 4s and 5s. Look for resistance around 108 for a nice 10 point run. Plenty of buying left here and looking for 106-7 tomorrow.
"Nice job President Trump.

Public relations nightmare. Do you think the soccer fans (short for fanatics) will ever forget?
"JPM continues with its tail wind with increased deposit and loan growth. The latest retail sales numbers are very positive for increased sales. This is why Warren Buffett are buying into bank stocks along with credit card companies like his favorite AXP , and start acquiring Synchrony Financials that is at a deep discount compared to AXP and generating very impressive free cash flow at forward 7.x P/E..His eyes are still sharp to spot the bargains.."
I wouldn't dare be holding this stock knowing how short JPM is on silver...and WSB going after them to destroy their short position...I hope JPM gets crippled
"NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE is going up parabolically without a single break, despite tanking corporate revenues!The Valuations are beyond insanity! Unbelievable! NASDAQ Composite is trading as PONZI SCHEME...$AAPL $AMZN $BLK $JPM"
Why the stock went down today given the good news on earning
Mortgage banking has to work with Feds to allow lower standard of credit. Foreclosure is running into an exceptional low end that spell some trouble for equity return.
WoW
"How did Hunter Biden and his felonious partners manage to open JPM bank accounts for oligarchs that were on International monetary watchlists?That's rather nefarious, no?"
"Love this company. Bad news coming up this week though, feds and economic data"
Goldilock period as James said. It will continues and let banks continue to return money to shareholders
JPM $200 target .. i don't see why it dropped ... DB? Who cares about DB?
"the company's debt and personal debt Will strong growth after covid-19 end, so buy jpm now will make a lot of money,"
"Lets party as JPM crashes and burns , Why? because they are losing business to BAC. How come? because JPM Obama bank is now not for all Americans as the cancer and views of I think I am so smart Jamie spreads far and wide inside the bank. We will never know how many Trump supporter are not getting loans now no matter what party they are with just because of the views of the CEO and bashing the president. We need banks for all Americans not just some . BAC is banking on AMERICA for ALL AMERICANS we need to invest and only do business with Banks that are for ALL Americans"
Super league deal is OFF
I feel like this is a trap today. watching only
"The banks need liquidity and the printing machine is making strange noises. This bank rally is a head-fake.Unfortunately the second wave is coming, the sentiment of the consumer is already shifting to saving and the aftershocks won't help. The market has to be comfortable trading down 25% without panic. The key is Powell and he can't create demand when there are no jobs... Sell."

Shorties are trying to take it down before the close. As Wallce said in Braveheart when the English were attacking William Wallace and his fellow Scots - HOLD-HOLD-HOLD. 4-6 dollar upward move coming. Do you honestly think Jamie Dimon wouldn't deliver monster earnings. I wouldn't take that bet even with 10 to 1 odds.
JPM needs to jack up their payout.....for the orphans and widows to buy bread and milk.....and maybe some Mexican Lucky. :-)

Okay. Sohttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/09/24/jp-morgans-dimon-id-rather-grow-our-business-than-buy-back-stock.html
"Told you JPM was losing business to BAC , Why because BAC was banking on America for ALL Americans. Why because JPM CEO voices his opinion on TRUMP and bashing the president.

"JPM can now double the Dividend to $4.00 per share.....and raise it 10% per year going forward. That’s an idea. 10,000 Baby Boomers are retiring Every Day in the US......Looking for income and income growth. :-)"
I've concerns as a shareholder after the Project Vertias revelations.If JPMorgan Chase discrimates based on political positons I will not stay as a shareholder and cardholder.Waiting for corporate response.
Banks will go down even deeper tmr!
"Diamond is still in darkness, (not his fault there is pressure from Goldman and FED and the environment) and what ever he promises today is going to be surprisingly incorrect. He is right about one thing, the recessions."

don't quite get it
"this is a great company and the dividend is reasonable, but the recent price movement is an over reaction and take the price above its growth potential. I’ll wait for 100 again. Should be sometime in next 3 weeks"
We had the shock news and hedge funds shorted. Now hedges have buy back and the price goes up since no real investors sold.

Jaime Dimon must be in the office today.
When is the earnings in the morning or after hours?
Does JPM hit $165 this year?
Bankers wear expensive suits because they are not good for your money in their bank.
What time are the earnings released?
"Notice that profits before chargeoff reserve were extremely good. Imagine you are in the presidents office, and thinking about the possibility of having outstanding profits for the quarter when the country is going down the drain. Thats bad p.r. Now you are reviewing the chargeoff reserve. You note that as of march 31, writeoffs havent increased, indicating that the usual quarterly writeoff reserve of a little over one billion should do the job. Is there a risk that writeoffs will skyrocket? Yes, there is a risk, but not a very big one, given all the stimulus money slopping around. I think it is most likely the reserve will be substantially reduced, 3 or 4 quarters from now, and profits will skyrocket. By then with the country doing well, no bad pr for chase for doing well. Invest accordingly."
does anyone know about the JPMorgan Chase Bitcoin

Beautiful company. Too bad everyone is busy posting on tremendously overvalued stocks like Netflix and amazon. Permalong JPM. Dimon 4 president. Down with R.

$JPM reports 3Q18 net income of $8.4B and $2.34 EPS on revenue of $27.8B; ROTCE of 17%
Expect another rate cut just like previous and then Powell will hold. The US needs the higher relative rates to help strengthen and stabilize its dollar as foreign investors hold in USD. Think jpm earnings will take a hit next qtr. narrower interest margins and weaker capital markets along with a tick up in bad loans... they might hold off on the bad loans write down who knows lol
Let’s make it a little bit gold is now well over $1700 an ounce and JP Morgan had a real nice date also but I’ll bet you by the end of the year goal will be much higher and JP Morgan will be much lower first off $2 trillion That’s going to be pumped in to the economy will fall way short most likely by June they’ll have another $2 trillion package and that’ll just keep on going as the unemployment rate will continue to soar like JP Morgan one said gold is money and everything else is credit and soon the credit markets are going to start to implode.
"Love this stock, way up after hours. Read the news article which implies a nice dividend increase in 2021. Not permitted to this year. Great investment. Will pay 90 cents/per share Jan. 31st. $1.00 next year seems likely."

tomorrow will be a good day
JPM at a buy point
what do you think? are they going to be the big winner of the bank earnings?
Why JPM is weak today and prior to earnings? What gives?
split long overdue for JPM???
"Warning bank stocks are risky af atm, shady things arr happening behind closed doors, this applies to pretty much all banks! You’ve been warned!"
very strong upward move with high volume. This is a great day

Almost every night on CNBC's Fast Money show somebody picks JPM as a Buy. Tonight it was Tim Seymour.Hope it breaks out like you've been touting for the last two weeks..
How much dividends I can get quarterly if I buy JPM at current (122$)price ?
FED need to raise rates to ease the complacency and then leave it there for the rest of the year. The rates are too low in the face of glowing global inflation. JPM should trade in a range of 122 to 142 for the next few months mainly due to a nice dividend.
Joke. Sell
"This is thief bank, going to retest 83 support."
short it ... along with Buffett ...!!!!!!!!!!! The junk is holding strong so far

if you like to short stocks you missed your opportunity for this 1. It's undervalued..If spotify is at 142.00 with no profits. Chase should be 280.00....
Follow JP Morgan’s lead they have silver for a reason and so should you most banks don’t have silver at all the banking Has tons of gold but silver is the soft underbelly.
"I just hold JPM , great dividend and we are making higher lows , what’s not to like about that , my core holdings all lower but they are all building higher lows and all have great dividends"
LOL no more IPO's this year after JPM screwed up the IPO market. No one will touch a IPO again . JPM made sure they LYFTed all the money out of your pockets. LOL
"The market makers can not let JPM moves up too fast, even though it deserves it. I think some one tries to accumulate JPM for next week. I think it will go even higher at the close."
Got in today @ $97.63 very happy about that
"We all know the IMF is working to stop using the dollar as the worlds currency.What we don't know is how much US banks are influencing what is done. Certainly the IMF gets input from JPM.Hey Jamie, are you telling the IMF to stop using the dollar ? is that why you bought tons of silver ?Isn't it a conflict of interest, for someone with insider knowledge, to use that information to enrich your bank ?When the world abandons the dollar, which many countries now want, we here in the US will be floundering around, like beached fish. And Jamie is helping it happen, and not warning us about it.https://medium.com/concoda/when-the-u-s-dollar-collapses-the-elites-will-try-to-steal-your-money-8e41a42f684c"
Have JPM in IRA for a little over five years with dividend reinvestment. about 122 gain
who cares if it goes to 85 80 etc etc etc. its long term....buy more
The 5 year will go to 3.3% this year
Got in 127 ... so baffled by it ... Why was it so low?
JPM topping out. Nominal new highs will continue. Reduce at 98-99. It may take a few stabs to break par. Higher rates should benefit bank stocks. Higher dividend rates to follow. Nervous Long
Fed news gonna stay the same so expecting drops back to near $108

So, basically the tax payers continue to print money to fund Jamie and friends. Too big to fail means these corporations are backstopped by the government. This is not capitalism. The wealthy control the government in a way that allows them to continue to manipulate the masses."
"Added JPM/BAC today. Great buys at these evualtions. JPM under a 100 and BAC under $24 are no questions buys.These banks are collecting all the deposit growth and all their branchs are located in the big cities and growth hubs over the next few decades. Small banks and wells/usb are scattered accross the nations. JPM/BAC focus on where the real money is, and the top 10% bank with these institutions.Big City Individual +Big Ego+Big Paycheck+Banks at BAC/JPM=Big mortgage/Car=Dividends for BAC/JPM investors."
"ipnff up 72% yesterday... great company, awesome ceo... AR IS THE NEXT sector in investing... buy before it is too late"
"Jamie wants to keep the mushrooms in the dark for 6 months at a time, vs 3. Transparency is what keeps the market healthy pal.forget 6 months, forget you Jamie."
Yesterday looks like a blowoff top after monumental run. Market cap was almost $500 billion. Shooting star candle after a huge rally is usually a reliable indicator of a trend reversal
"If Biden shuts down the country for a month, there is a way to fight back.While we are in lockdown, we must all avoid buying goods from China. We must also stop borrowing money.The worlds elites are pushing manufacturing around the world. Banks are enabling them. We can punish them, and help ourselves.During the lockdown, avoid doing all business with any business round table company. During the lockdown, consider divesting your business roundtable holdings.Or do you like sitting in the basement, while China is once again taking our jobs away."
$106 is key support.

"Wells Fargo (WFC) analyst Mike Mayo wrote that the stress tests highlighted banks' resiliency, but that the Fed was now keeping them ""on a tight leash."" He estimates that the ""largest banks we cover will still pay their dividends"" even with the requirement that they must earn it in the prior four quarters."""
"Stess test results? LMAO, might as well starting buying because you know it's going to be all roses."
"Who's buying today?? I swore I had enough, but at these prices what woman could ignore a ""sale""? And I don't ever have to worry about a color being wrong, or the size not fitting! Love going shopping when the product is so good!! Good Luck to all of you!! :-)"

"good luck to everyone tomorrow morning, hope banks go up huge!!!"
"If banks are weak, investors are considering recession. But analysts are very positive. Something not making sense."

Can't vote of any DEM wits and now that includes Trump after a no grand deal. No Wall and No grand deal for sure Trump now loses in 2020. Problem is you just can not vote for either party anymore. They both let the American people down and have destroyed America.

He is saying over 2-3 years ... but from when? No idea about it. Just talk and create panic in the market and equally irresponsible is the media; the way it was published.
"Futures up on Powells’s bullish statements on 60 minutes.“The economy will recover and will start in the second half of year. Most notably, the Fed is far from being out of ammunition.. Again, don’t bet against America, and definitely don’t bet against the Fed. GLTALongs!"
Stock market is green because JPM today

Bought @$96.50. Not selling ever. Going to $100+ very soon!
"Funny how everyone was bullish. It's a lesson in how to read psychology of the markets and trade to win like a contrarian. This is a ""sell the news"" event, price won't push over 100 like so many of you think. God Bless You."
I think Jamie Dimond going to make a run at President which I think would be great . Drawback would be JPM shares probably take a hit .
"Stock is capitulating and forming a awesome base, get ready for a nice gap higher from here in. Nice to be able to get in at lows of the day."
why is on the green ? why ?
JPMorgan Profit Sinks to Lowest Since 2013Stock will reach the level in year 2013
If you look at the numbers Citi did the best this quarter due to their very conservative investing which has made them very slow in growing but ready for this type of problem.

Strong Buy! https://www.cweb.com/the-rise-of-jamie-diamond-of-jp-morgan-and-making-chase-the-most-successful-bank-in-the-world/
"With the rise of interest rates, I'm trying to find out what JPM's CD'S pay. They are hard to find. Probably embarrassed to tell us. Remember 15 years ago, when you could get a 5 year rate of 5%.. Every retiree in the US is glad to see rates rise, so that they get some income off their savings."
"Fed reduce debt can offset tax cut affect, SO buy bank stock, bank stock price still too low, tax cut affect bank's mortgage rates rise just temporary. the economic strong growth could boost bank's earning growth."

JPM will lose 20 percent over the next 4 months. Sold 500 shares last week.
"Up 2.3% since yesterday's post. Try to stay long and for next leg up. AP named the players who will gain from higher rates. Bonds clipped today. Even ""Fake Account"" Wells Fargo will gain from rate increases, and Berkshire profits implicitly."
"JPM defies gravity on Wall Street. Good earnings report means Sell, Sell, Sell. Go figure."
"This is BAC at fault today, nothing to do with JPM. Shouldn't matter, but seems to have bled into finances in general."

"how ever bank stock earnings have peaked, no room to growth, so bank stock will go down 20%after strong up today, unemployment rate touch 3.8%, retail sales slowdown, that means people spend money have peaked,"
Based on the numbers JPM is worth about $50 to $60 per share at best. They made less than Citi did.
if you'd like to make money buying a great stock just buy ZYNGA. Many hedge funds have upgraded it and the outlook is really positive tho
This was 24 T years in 1.
Any split in the near future?
"why would any analyst downgrade a stock a few days before ER, it makes no sense not to wait to hear the data and the outlook as reported by the company. Then actually do what you are suppose to, which is ""ANALYZE"" then decide to downgrade or upgrade."

"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out http://tradenow.xyz. They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."

Because, JPM Market Makers supplied sold GE Buy back shares at $30, now MANIPULATING to get those shares back at $10. Thus trying to pocket $40 BILLION GE Buy back money.."

Let’s see how many trillions of dollars they’re going to pump into the economy before the election all of this money will be tacked on the federal deficit which is owed to the Fed banks which are no part of the federal government they are independent banks that the country owes money to you just cannot print trillions of dollars out of thin air and expected to have the same purchasing power that it had before they were printed inflation has started in every day things we need and this is just a start Our government has a solution it’s called dilution and that is the petrodollar
Grab this now are do we wait for more drop?
Should consider giving a free subscription to Movie Pass to those who open accounts over a certain minimum dollars as a promotion.Cheaper and more fun than a toaster.
"So the testing is the cause of the spikes, but death rate and hospitalizations are down. Californina and New York tested the same number of people. California has 1/3 of the total cases and the death rate is 3% versus NY which has a death rate of 8%. The media and the health officials are just hyping for ratings and importance. These number flow through all the ""spiking"" states. Florida has tested 2 times Michigan and again the death rate is 1/2 to 1/3 of Michigan so Florida is doing the correct thing by testing more of the people and punished for the numbers."
no position but hopefully a beat or it should drag market s down
What is this stock?
10 percent upside tomorrow; melt up!!!&
JPM going under?
just bought 100 shares
It is skyrocketing today.
"The trouble is that there is no fear in the Millennial and the ""me-my"" generation people have never tasted stock markets losses. My son bought JPM today in his retirement account at very high price even when I am advising people that it will drop to below 70 at some point or go to $55. They have no senses as they feel they will be left out. So they are a bigger part of the herd mentality where the good news is good, but bad news is even better. No matter what you tell them they say we will hold them for ever if they go down. But, they do not realized that they can be hurt badly. Now he is in a loss for the day."
Ha ha!!! Bought in sept at $91. Jamie diamond is paying me $15k a year in dividends while my gains go up $200k!!!
Jamie... Thank you!!!! We should see 115.50/116.75 before end of coming week.
"if it hits 115 i'll short with everything i have, and then take an home equity load to double up"
A 2 for 1 Split would be great! Just wishful thinking :-)
"The fall in JPM is not due to coronavirus, but to the fall in oil. Does any of the good posters/researchers here have, offhand, the size of JPMs loans to oil? Just gauging from the fall today, some larger investors seem to think it's pretty huge. With the Saudis about to wreck the Russian economy (taking at least Venezuela with it), the hurt will surely flood here and to Canada/Mexico. I'm not even sure where to look to see how invested JPM is in oil."
Don’t vote for Shaun Donovan NYC. He is more of the same old same old.
I bought at today’s high and am not worried in the least.
Stock went down post earnings because loan growth was down 2% yr/yr and they lowered guidance on net interest income by 0.5 billion for the fiscal year of 2019
"NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE is perfectly correlated with Coronavirus Cases and Deaths! The more People dies, higher NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE goes...$AAPL $JPM $AMZN"
"Since the left is committed to socialism, the destruction of private companies, then any company that donates to the left is violating its fiduciary duty to its lenders, the shareholders. Look at the list of corporate donors to the left, JPM, Chase, Chemical Bank, Bear Stearns, and complain to management, that they are apparently helping to elect people bent on destroying the open market, and their price share. 7 out of 8 want to tax stock trades. Why do you stay invested in a company which wants to hurt you. https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000000103"
Dont have a good feeling about today across the board.
"JPMorgan’s Metals Desk Was a Criminal Enterprise, U.S. Says"
"I believe with those positive vaccine news, JPM is a very strong buy today."
"I would take 108 for my shares , that would pay my house off and I will be debt free !"
Chase will cross 100 once stimulus is passed. Easily 110 dollars a share this year and 130 next year. No risk of downside
"All the banks have already peaked, it’s downhill from now!!"

BUFFETT LOVES THE BANKS!
$150 target ...

Anything new w the dividend?
I did a few more than that in 2004 but who's counting all that money. jk
Goldman is red again and getting ever closer to a 52 week low.Since 90% of trumps cabinet from Goldman what do they know that you don’t ?
"JPM CEO Dem0n KARNA gave him HEART-ATTACK for MANIPULATING GE Stock proce to STE@L FROM MILLIONS OF Old senior HATDEST WORKING Retired Investors in GE STOCK.. JPM supposed to be HE Bank, but JPM BACKSTABBING GE TO STEAL GE AND GE SHAREHOLDERS ASSETS VALUES.."
"Guys, it is 7 down days straight to the tune of 7% nonstop."
Why is GoldMan Sachs hitting new 52 week lows ever day ?Anyone know ?Could this start a financial contagion ?
"Great quarter, the dividend increase will come in handy!"
"Lets go over it again. The round table says profits, the reason that investors buy stock, and lending the company money, and allowing it to grow, is only their 6h priority. This is in clear violation of their articles of incorporation and SEC fiduciary duties.Borrowers of round table banks, should, after telling the bank they will repay the loan, and getting their money, should tell the bank, that paying the money back is only the 6th priority. If round table companies can break their promises to shareholders, then borrowers should be allowed to break their promise to lenders. JPM isn't interested in shareholders, its interested in marching to the one government agenda. And under a one government world, there will be no JPM. And your investment will be gone, like your freedom. JPM already stole your money when you bought their stock. Its just the beginning. wake up."
The lameness of this session cannot be overstated.
"GE shareholders have $500 BILLION Lawsuit against JPM Toosa and Markapolos, for Market Price Manipulation for so long, and Misinformation 24/7, for years, Conflict of interest. JPM is GE Market Maker, Advisers, Deal Maker, Analyst, that is huge Market Manipulation Conflict of Interest.."
"Earnings 37% higher than 1Q last year and 28% higher than 4Q. People are taking profits, but I'm happy to wait for much higher down the road."
"Financials will go down about another 25%. Even though dividends are not cut as slow down looms. A large part of the markets have gone up rather than down. I am not expecting a dramatic progress. This might take about 3 or more years as structural changes are coming and also I would fear away from technology except in medical sciences. We have built enough on technology for the next 25 to 30 years. It has hurt human capital. Moreover, the defense spending s will dramatically slow down for the next decade. Most countries are sitting on unnecessary war planes, tanks, ships, submarines and other excessive ammunitions. As of October 2019, I feel tech and defence party is over done.Time has come for large corporations to rule for a few years. But, forget tech spending, it's going to be wasteful investing in it for the next decade. Without proper/ higher interest rates I do not see progress for small caps or private Independent businesses."
JPMorgan Chase is it a short opportunity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g74PbVyn6c

"jpm earnings very good,but stock price too low,it's reasonable price should $150,because it's earnings continues growing,covid19 disaster didn't stop it's growing,after covid19 end it's will be going up to$250."
According to Tom cloud and Andy Shackman these guys have been in business for 40 years and they have never seen the amount of buying that they have seen this past summer you’re going to see that a country that thinks it can print its way to prosperity regional history books currency to valuations are 100% guaranteed we all know that healthcare the cost of food and just about everything you buy has gone up and so have your taxes but this is just a start the middle class is on borrowed time when his stock market crashes everything goes with it along with all generational wealth that is tied to paper the transfer of wealth has already started and it is not in the paper it is in hard assets which are gonna be harder to get day after day as they are being taken off the market and put away just think of all the huge manufacturers that rely on silver for the electronics and just about anything you buy today when the rubber meets the road we’re going to see a massive up move in silver it is not only a monetary metal it is also a strategic metal that The world needs to sell their end products this past year 80% of all mine silver has been taken off the market by investors which leaves 20% for manufacturing to use we will see in very short order these manufacturers will be working deals to secure their future if you don’t wanna hold it you don’t own it when all these contracts that are coming up decide that they want their physical silver and it is not there look out do United States over the last month how to import silver from all over the world to meet its demand and of all places the most came from Germany I was quite surprised because from what I hear it’s very hard for the German people to even get silver plus there’s a big tax on it to buy maybe that is going to come this way too because once the middle working class figures out all that they hold is paper with dead Presidents on it or digital numbers that have no value at all that is precisely the point gold and silver are gods money it takes hard work and energy to obtain these metals and they’re getting scarce or by the day the big fines have a ready been mined in grams per ton or decreasing yearly silver and gold will get you to the other side of the reset that is coming that’s why central bank China Russia and India and for that matter the world has been hoarding gold and silver very quietly as a US on its debt based Ponzi scheme will go up in flames
banks are hated no matter what earnings they post
"I do not bother looking at JPM anymore.....I know the price will be around $104. LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY, GRASS GROW, or simply put BORING! When will JPM start to move up.....not expecting a huge increase, how about $108, not much to ask for, just to let us know the stock is alive."
"If anyone is claiming that there is no bubble, he/she has no brain or wants more quick capital gains without working, or have no idea about valuations, fundamentals and multiples.$AAPL $JPM $TSLA"
All Banking stocks are green except JPM..
JPM-PD is up 5.36% to 24.42
JPM CEO will get Face cancer for STEALING from GE SHAREHOLDERS Baby-boomers in millions.. MANIPULATING GE PRICE
Buffet Deputy buys $1.5 Million JPM Stock !!!
"We have now no need for Big banks or the FED and their manipulation , Time to disband the FED that wants to control the out come of our elections. Just make Apple , Facebook, Google and Amazon full on Banks and we don't need any of the big banks anymore that have been praying on the people for ever."
Tomorrow selloff on Ex-DD seen this before got burned before institutions unload.
the choice is made BANKS WILL RETURN TO LEAD THIS MARKET THE MARKET HAS DROPED OVER 800 POINTS ROTATION FROM TEC NOWS THE TIME TO BUY
This is a joke banks are more than likely banking on this pandemic this will be their best years yet down from $140? this should be at $180 by now can't wait till everyone betting against it loses their life savings.
Can chase reach 105?
if so why don't the Fed ask Mr. Diamond to roll back his over $120 million dollars bonus before his exit from JPM last Quarter. That money was the bail out grant which he used on buy back and his huge bonus on top of his severance before he left.
11 x earnings for the beast of finance and beyond is a bargain. Buy.
Bye Dividends!
CFO said interest rate drop would not significantly impact earnings
Literally every bank that had positive earnings today is up but no not JPM...smh total ##
Giant Kroger tanking huge Mammoth Kroger tanking huge as consumers cut spending...KR 24.75-3.69 (-12.96%)<—-Jpm on deck
Sgmd is up and moving fast 10k is out
With the FED cutting interest rates interest margins change hurting banks. This is why banks are dropping after earnings
"JPM div. increased to 80 cents/quarter, thank you Jamie !!!!"
Just pencil in $130 for JPM.
you guys sell berkshire and buffett are slowly building a massive JPM position. thanks!
"My biggest concern is the national deficit. If we can't reduce it in booming times, where will we be when the economy turns down. Secondly, I don't believe the inflation numbers. The president wants interest rates to go down and by reporting low inflation that supports his wants. Inflation is much higher folks."
JPM is the best bank in the world. Guys booked much higher LLP than needed as Fed + Gov saved economy from a depression.
I read on Stocktwits that of it keeps dropping $1 a day it will be zero in just 97 days lol
During large pandemics like COVID19 (it happen first time by the way) large financial services were always collapsing a lot. So expect a huge collapse here this time again.
"Are people buying this stock at the current stock price or are you guys waiting for ""the drop"" (seems like most people will be buying at the $80 value) correct me if im wrongCheers"
Financial value rotations has not started yet.. stay tight guys.. Can $BAC $JPM $TFC $C has more long shot soon.. transportation and energy started these upside once banks joins - S&P and RUT to year high..
"fake news CNBC on JPM earnings ""not worse than feared"" They missed badly and all indications per Jamie Diamond it is going to get worst. He thinks this is going to continue to June or July.Why can't CNBC just report the news not spin it."
JP Morgan giving out a Bad Rating on a UNIT !! Which makes Money and Beat earnings!! 3/4 of 5G runs Through UNIT !! No matter where in The U.S.A. and in North America!! I bet next quarter We find out JP Morgan was Buying UNIT cheap!! JP Morgan has done this Before. Gave a Company a Bad Rating then bought shares of the Company Cheap. Then next quarter after JP Morgan Bought a ton of shares of that company. Changed their Ratings on that Company to Positive.
Trump going to Walter Reid is precautionary. Does the MSM really have to overhype everything?
They had some interesting insights about JPM on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Where's the action? Would have thought it would be up much more by now. A little concerning.
nervousness in closing...could it be a spring in the morning????
"Chase manipulated the PPP loans and gave the money to their biggest customers & many comapnies that did not deserve it. We're a small business and did not receive the PPP loan - filed right away & ALL paper work. SCAM. We are leaving Chase for a small local bank now - I know MANY other small businesses that are doing the same - no more brokerage, checking(business and home), savings, mortgage, business laon, credit cards. BYE Chase....no one picks upp the phone."
"Here we go, Traditional, Magical NO VOLUME EOD HYPE! All US indexes are getting PUMPED into EOD again! Nobody knows how or why!$AAPL $AMZN $JPM $BAC"
JPM will be at 140 to 150 by years end.
"True pps is 45$. They missed earnings estimate by 55% and don’t have any forward guidance. Also, only the last month in q1 should have an impact. But share price is just 30% off its lows. This makes no sense!!!"
All 3 indexes green but many stocks are in red today
"Is it my impression or the earnings were stellar on all metrics? Anything out of the ordinary here or in term of growth potential for Q2 2021, or even the rest of 2021?"
hold it longer ... 10 yrs and put limit order like $400 to prevent mafia from shorting it
The huge move and gold and silver are just starting silver is the most undervalued asset in the world the banks are losing control people will soon be taking out their money and purchase real money God’s money silver and gold.
Everything is going up.. regardless of earning. This is how corrupted Wall Street is
why does everything Buffett invest in drop in price?
This is criminal....rich stealing tax payer money again to prop up their asset prices
Congress went home: zero stimulus progress $jpm $gs
PYPL is a 330B cap now...a run away train ready to be biggest financial firm
"Need to pay your workers, they are the actual economic drivers. The rich hold their money."
Last split for JPM was 17 years ago in 2000...3-1 split due?
"Hold to sell at $122, don’t sell lower, it would go up to $130 end of the year."
10 yr bond = 1.049
"trading volume very low today, why trading volume SO low???because analysts upgrade Amazon, Facebook and Google too many times, others stock nobody buy, especially retailers stock, SO bank stock will go down 15% [including GS, MS, ] if they continue upgrade AMZN, Google and FB."
Time to hedge JPM?
"Crooked Wells Fargo, Apple, Oracle, Sleepy Coke, Rails, now 3Gs Slice and dice Kraft Heinz. Cut your way to growth? Still No dividend. Buy and hold works, but nimble isn't a Berkshire trait. Lately, BK seems the kiss of death to companies it owned. Great, now he's going to pollute my $jpm...Th"
"People who are buying into this are dangerous to others. Just look at the price actions. If you buy right now you are paying probably 16 to 20 dollars more than Friday and in the last week we had major bad new and it was not even taken into consideration. Hence, there is a pied piper and many are following that into the sea. So be careful.Every company is going to put positive spin on its story and try to take it higher as the same monkey tactics will continue thanks to the coming elections eveything the companies do with the books will be considered OK. Best is not to follow and stay out. Let the fake liquidity dry out. Just look at PE's they are a lofty 20+ on the indexes meaning all individual stocks are way expensive. Republicans are probably worried and masterminding the rallies along with their international supporters."
"NOTHING will happen to JPM . Do you think FED will allow JPM to go under ? I don't think so. FED would print trillions and bail them out. Head JPM wins and tail, JPM does not lose."
The banks are buying gold and silver the crash is coming do what they do not what they say
"You just never know , I had a decent amount of shares purchased around 91 then for some reason I broke one of my rules and added another chunk at 117 , good lord has blessed my decision and I am very Thankful"
Don't worry. It's roo big to fail.
With the fed speaking today do you think it’ll cause a positive effect on the bank stocks?
Up above $137 a share. Huge gain wish I could figure out why Any ideas
American savers lost an estimated $500 billion due to low interest rates since the financial crisis
Check my history I called jpm to 120. I still think we can hit 130 even with bad news rate cut for banks
113 is next
"oh boy. i love that the market is dropping again. Not in a rush and looking VERY long term. I will be buying JPM when dist settles in about 30 days or so. Adding to my JPM, DIS, AAPL, AMZN and a few other positions....WHEN the time is right."
Sell and short to JPM. It's going to retest 83. Sell off hasn't started yet.
The apes are coming May 1 is another silver raid making commitments to buy anywhere from 1 ounce 2000 ounces of silver we will take our country back one ounce at a time when the collapse of the stock market comes Silver Will have unbelievable value 1 ounce of silver will be able to purchase 1 acre of land that’s how valuable this commodity is.
Estimated EPS is $2.62. Any guesses out there? I'll guess $2.88
Tech ERs next week. Deflation for next 6 months. This will drop below $60. Be patient and buy at low.
"up 1.65 in pre-market. When market opens add 2-3 more dollars. As I stated, 110-112 today"
"JPM has been a great investment for over 25 years. Some hard down periods. Shares I bought in 1991 have a basis of $5.89 after the 2/1 and 3/2 splits. With a current $2.24 annual dividend, it sports a 38% yield on those shares. Owned through the Chemical Bank takeover of old Chase and JP Morgan take over by Chase. My only investment still held from 20th Century Purchases."
cck multiple squeezes this along with jpm c wfc should see a sudden flurry of buying
This will move up a few $ a day until earnings. Then we might shoot back up to $110 or more...banks are going to start rallying as tech is overbought.
I'm sure this is one tall Turkey !!
Too bad now the bank looses the fee on stock. buyback better sell the Hampton house. Haha. You all deserve it. Diamond has no heart
"The CEO on CNBC doesn't realize criticizing the POTUS is not in the best interest of the shareholders. It doesn't matter if he is right or not he should stick to banking, interest rates, accounts etc. To open up about the Presidents team is not worth the grief or maybe even backlash that may come with it. Why risk a good run JPM is on. When you are at the table having a great turkey dinner, there is nothing wrong with saying you don't like peas, but don't say it was a mistake to serve them."
Unexpected rally
The bottom should be in for JPM (short term)
price prediction for tomorrow?
No stimulus will be like
C and WFC had more convincing earnings it seems
Buffet is too old to adjust. He has been upside down alot. And he cant use inside info from dinners at restaurants. He invests based on interest rates and that is no longer logical and parallel to the markets. So he sold banks early. Big deal.
Dividend increase?
"Will buy more with my $1,200 check!"
"These lines right here folks. The provision for credit losses was $10.5 billion, up $9.3 billion from the prior year driven by reserve builds which reflect further deterioration and increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook as a result of the impact of COVID-19. The Wholesale reserve build was $4.6 billion across multiple sectors, and the Consumer reserve build was $4.4 billion, largely in Card."
"Banks make money with other people’s money, so if the people are not making money banks aren’t make money either."
Analyst predictions aren’t worth the paper they are written on. They are very good at predicting what happened yesterday.
"Great entry point. This will bounce back to $95-$98 next week. Amazing value with little down side risk. For long term investors this is and excellent day to add more, best in breed."
Near all time high and still a bargain with 15 PE. 1.33 trillion in cash. Wow.
"sold some shares this morning, but the chase bank app gas my money in cash sweeps and I can't use it to buy other positions. any reason for this?"
If you bought this stock after September 2017 you have now lost money
Would sure like to see div go to .88 next month
"$55 will be coming soon. So keep safe. Stock is over priced. Fair value before the drop was $70 on JPM. So this valuations are expensive. Moreover, the Corona Pandemic has not even to begun to hurt their clients. Also loss of interest rates or lower rates will substantially hurt the business."
Dead cat today.
They deserve a 20 billion dollar plus fine.Committing fraud to manipulate markets should never be seen as a risk reward scenario for ANY company!
This will be 110 by next Friday
This is where the Money is ! 
JPM is best of breed and will pass stress test and maintain dividend
"Bye, see you at S&P 2200"
stocks ran last year for this years earnings = simple as that
Deutche bank is buckling today pre market back to 10’s and dangerously close to new 52 week lows...Hmmmm
$65 to $90 in 3 months...what an incredible run... Trust things are just perfect!
"Clear Out Performer in the banking world even in ZIRP they can make money trading, investments, and with fee's. Jamie Dimon and James Crown have $100s of Millions of JPM Tied up in their portfolios/Trusts. This thing ain't going nowhere but up and once all this chaos is over. Buyback and Dividends Increases will be back. Let's not forget 900 billion in CASH."
"Goldman is tanking again..Goldman Sachs stock is down a staggering 40% from its 52 week high and just broke into 169 level from 275 I told my wife when Goldman hits a 50% loss or about 137 per share the Dow will be under 20,000.. also see record 46 Billion in stock outflows reported by lipper on Friday a record as smart money moves their fed induced bubble market gains to the safety of money  markets where they gain interest and don’t lose money..Do you disagree we are in a bear  market now With fed raising rates again on Wednesday ?"
still very cheap stock though but not for weak hands ...
A guru on CNBC said ealry am Jpm fair value s 120 to 125.
$120 in 3 weeks
"Great earnings and dividend increase is coming. The ""sell on the news"" traders are fools."
big corporates are positive
stop loss take out maybe?
"120 this week, the economy is very strong and banks are undervalued."
First you PUMP IT than you ...........
"p/e of 12 would make this a $128 stock, nice QTR"
"Just got in, 12 month outlook is very good"
Time to trade JPM for C which is 20% cheaper about same yield with only an 18% payout ratio vs 25% for JPM
So why would anyone bid this up to 131.75 at 4:03 PM when they could have bought it for 126.32 three minutes earlier. BS games IMO
pre market open down $2.53. could be a brutal day.

"YOu may have noticed that almost every time JPM is recommended or up-talked on TV, JPM goes down, fearing manipulations by talking heads."
"Today, was a technical bounce or better yet, a dead car bounce. It is an uncertain and mad market, but anyone who thinks that everything bad is good and everything good is Best may enjoy short and cry long term. This paradigm we see in the markets is FED induced side effect that keep investors high at all cost. But, no matter who and how the accommodating world is, the structural changes will impact all businesses unless FED starts raising rates harder and faster. They will never do that out of fear. But, if fears have grown upon wrongful basis or sins then they are real and they will hurt the fearful."
JPM T01LER P1GS TH1EVES ONLY REASON GE PRICE MANIPULATION FOREVER.. JPM Rep was KICKED OUT BY GE Mgmt from GE BOD.. Since then the MANIPULATION

CNBC reported Jamie bought $17 million worth of JPM stock as of the close on Friday March 27 along with his direct reports who purchased shares in varying amounts. Is this fake news or real?
"Hmm... Hopefully the FED did allow buybacks so JPM/BAC management can escape and let this thing tank to $60s. I just bought 10k worth, but I am a bit worried."

"Heard Buffet just bought JPM. Everyone here, enjoy your green tomorrow!"
JPM had great earnings report. It really shows.
Interesting to hear all the doom and gloom predictions (mostly without any substantiating evidence). As charming as Cramer's track record. As a 40+ year holder of this bank stock....it doesn't owe me a thing and could go to zero and I'd still be in the black. Some stocks are worthy of holding for a lifetime.
Volume up 28%stock extreme dumping of this and other banks. Free fall would be a good description. This is the best bank and will survive but the pain may take years to recover and the dividend may go away!
"JPM CR00KS RIGHING, MANIPULATING GE PRICE NOW FOR 4 YEARS.. L00TING, TRIED SMASH & GRAB BABY-BOOMERS INVESTMENTS, PENSIONS, DIVIDENDS..."
"Who did short yesterday ? Should be buy to cover to day ,"
The Republicans offered a stimulus deal the Democrats rejected it. I think you have no choice but to vote Republican.
The battle cry of the bears is “Mark Esperanto”!
JPM can SMD for spoofing. Hope they lose all their money.
today dropped more than 56 cents so dividend players lost money today.
OMG! Are you taking advantage of these free trade alerts? If not there literally has to be something wrong with you. go to (http://Pick-stocks.com) now.
"geez talk about taking a beating. I was long, but this is a bit much. Changing my position to short"
Stock split coming?
"Well done JPM, now time for WFC and C to beat earnings. So we can finally get out of this 2670 resistance."
Buy JPMorgan this year and in 5 years you will be sailing your new yacht in the Bahamas. Big banks always win
Jp Morgan bought array yesturday ? this is correct information? how can i check?
"If you stack $1.9 trillion $1 dollar bills the stack would be 128,945 miles highWhy do we need to spend this much money now? Oh wait... museums and a new bridge... give me a break"
"If you owe JPM money on a loan, its going to be fun times ahead.For you see, when you can't pay it back, tell the judge that banks, including JPM got billions, and that congress gave you 600 dollars. Tell the judge its what the government wants. tell the judge that since jpm was in on the virus planning, and shut down planning, that they should bear the brunt of loan losses. Not innocent taxpayers."
hedge funds taking a few dollars off the table before Friday earnings just in case. look for earnings to knock the ball out of the park. Jpm is king of the hill
Down to 103 - please....
dollar averaging on JPM ...
insane bull market. everything now owned by the US FED. all bubbles man.
"here we go everyone, bank stocks about to drop big....thank you Maxine Waters!! She says she will fight any loosening of bank regulations when she takes over the Finance Committee. The dems will kill this market, they need to take away the economy as a win for Repubs to run on in 2020."
JPM heading to $118 by EOY. By next ER will be $128. I am holding long and strong....Any thoughts on where JPM lands in short term.
guys check out BABA good time to get in.
"Fed funds point to a 1/4 point rise this month.Probability went from 40-80-to nearly 100% to tighten. I'm guessing JPM goes down a little and then shots for parity? I'm working a GTC sell order for another 20% of a long term position at $99.88. When you look at 20 year chart it seems wise to ring the register. More share buybacks and higher divs backup price, but if this overall frothy market gives back you can believe JPM follows. I'll buy that dip. GLTA"
Split overdue for jpm...and divvy increase coming too...
A quick tip for you people WFC's 1 Y forward earning yield is 9% while Tesla's 0.74%. Do you know what that means? WFC will make $9 dollars for every 100 dollars you spend on their stock while Tesla will make $0.74 for every $100 you spend on their stock. So think again how much growth you expect from Tesla I am not talking about right now I am talking about 1 Y later's expectation. Tesla needs to grow x13-15 just to break even with WFC. So do you think a company that produces EV will be able to make that kind of money? I don't think so they have never been a profitable business nor they will be. $WFC $TSLA $BAC $JPM
JPM split coming soon...
"sell 105 put next week. Small number for now but may increase if it drop and become in money.Result were solid and market sell off is reason it down. While I expect market sell off continue, Solid result help prevent this to go below 100 for sure."
could have scripted this response. Always the same.
"You really want to find out how fake this market is ?, CNBC been preaching all morning, that the market is less than 3% of it's all time high, but when you look at companies like ,(JPM),(C), (GS),(WFC ), (TECK) (X) (SU) just to name a few ,they are all between 25 % to 45% from their high's, welcome to the fake world that most of you live in ,Bam,Bam,Bam."

U guys think jpm will go down to 89 to 85 area???
START OF NEW QUARTER MONDAY.....MUTUAL FUNDS WILL BE BUYING BILLIONS IN BANK STOCKS....JPM UP AT LEAST A DOLLAR.......DIG?
The blue wave will collapse the economy
"Is there anything that we did not know about before? Buyback postponement was already there. Fed did not ask banks to cut dividend, isn't that a good thing? Dividend cap was already baked in and fed is saying that only for 3rd quarter. so, what is new guys? dumping afterhours for no reason. Any reason why C is up afterhours?"
"My guess is the credit cards may start higher default rates. If the dems get in, you can be assured that they will look to make personal bankruptcies easier and less harmful to your credit. Chase does a huge CC business."
No one wants the banking problems of the past but it seems inevitably possible.
"$1 billion fine for illegal trading practices, money laundering, tons of drugs found on a freighter owned by JPM...boy they must truly believe they're above the law! Maybe they are...."
MARKET UP AND #$%$ DOWN HAHAHHA
"JPM has 37,000 thousand employees in New York. Because DiBlasio would not give JPM a tax break, Jamie is going to move thousands of them out. The irony here is JPM and other banks are large liberal campaign donors. So when they donate left, they are hurting themselves. But in this case, I agree 100% with DiBlasio, the part time mayor. He, and no other government official should give any tax breaks. Tax breaks are corporate welfare. If states and cities all stopped handing out inducements, personal income taxes would drop, and businesses would pay their fair share. I applaud Di Blasio for standing up to the roundtable. But its the only good thing he's done. O, and AOC cost New York thousands of jobs. If we could just get the rest of the country to fight big business, then we'd have something. For you see, when big business pillages tax payers, I'd rather have socialism."
So you downgraded silver in the mining stocks why is that ropes and poles or what you should be investing in for all your executives.
Bank carnage seems played out. good buying opportunity for JPM imo.
you realy dont need to learn any type of math... for profit just swing it back and forth... follow trump and the market.. she will go high.. but I won't be long here.. Nov is just around the corner folks.. US = BAD = THIS STILL WILL DROP !https://soundcloud.com/angkorian/jaya-ali-wanted-you
Even without the stimulus JPM is undervalued.
JPM....will soar...the greatest profit making bank on the planet....!!!!..stay long!!!!….divvy and growth potential....exponential...with tremendous growth coming..!!!!!
Bull tomorrow!!!
"the bank stock down 15percent after tax cut, because investors continue support Amazon make price war, the bank's analysts continue upgrade Amazon, no inflation forever. the mortgages rate will go down."
JPM will touch the 80s next week. Maybe even 70s if it gets really wild.
DONT LET IT GO ABOVE 100.50 DONT

Sold all my tech last week and put it all in BAC JPM. I knew this would happen. Making $$$$$!!!!!

"Sorry shorts, we call that a buying opportunity. Blue chip investors like me bought $95s, I wanted to buy $100s but already trading $103+. Goldman rocking. No manipulation here it's called funds buying dividend paying value stocks..."
"I've been a past shareholder some time ago. Sold my holdings twice around the $100 and $120 mark. Just took a position in JPM in hopes of repeating a similar trade. I don't recommend this unless you are a long term investor. Could be a few years before we see $120 again. In the meantime, I'll just collect the dividend."
Most of the bank stocks are still still getting scorned from the debacle they pulled a decade ago . FITB PE is 10. Still time to buy and hold take the dividend in the mean time.
Hey look. JPM used creative accounting to make it look good. NICE GOING.
This will be easily 105 to 110 tomorrow ...low expectation is set up
"If the p/e drops further this company is going to be a sale. Buy, buy, buy."
this is a cheap stock with a nice dividend. back to 100. snapped some up in the high 70s yesterday
certainly hoping jpm is using this time to buy back some stock

"Wonder if JPM is still holding onto their vast silver hoards ?I hope ATTY Gen Barr does something to stop the big banks from taking over our oil industry.As makers of money, oil is probably better at it than the banks.But why should a bank get bailout money ?

JPM downgrades itself-
if JPM were confident they would have announced an increase in the common dividend by now. Many companies increased the dividend in January as soon as the tax cut was finalized. By rights dividend should increase between 20 and 40% to reflect cut in Corporate tax rate. JPM would still have $2 billion to make so called technology investments!
hmmmm why the stock went up today? there no institutional buyers?
If the markets had been down today. The stock would have dropped $6 a share....

$COTY is in sweet spot to go up no matter what other market does.. covid is almost done with election and $CCL $NCLH $CUK $PLAY $BAC $JPM $AMEX $C $MS will be up.
my guess would be if earnings hit the $2.28 estimate stock could increase a little. think price moving today is in anticipation of of that est being met or slightly over. if beat is .10 or 12 cents probably one to two dollar increase after announcement

"US Big Bank have become uninvest able, why they are all run by the Government just like China banks were the dividends can and will be cut at any major signs of slow down or recession. Does not matter what the bank thinks just like back in 2009 the dividends will be cut and it will be one for all and all for one , because the government won't want a run on the banks so they will all have to cut. Not smart investing for your hard earned money , Dividend cuts the stocks get slaughtered and you take a double hit , because you don't get paid to wait for them to come back. US big banks are now just very bad investments"
Silver to the moon
Banks are run by the Government they will be told every year if they can raise or have to cut the dividend any slow down Guess what the government will tell them to cut the dividend Don't invest in the banks for a dividend because they are only good for 1 year.

"“Everything predicted by the enemies of banks, in the beginning, is now coming to pass. We are to be ruined now by the deluge of bank paper. It is cruel that such revolutions in private fortunes should be at the mercy of avaricious adventurers, who, instead of employing their capital, if any they have, in manufactures, commerce, and other useful pursuits, make it an instrument to burden all the interchanges of property with their swindling profits, profits which are the price of no useful industry of theirs.” –Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814."

"Another easy 200% short-squeeze gain candidate - ""VXRT""VXRT charts - IMPORTANT - Do you see how VXRT suddenly improved about 9:56AM EST? That is because the SSR (Short Sale Rule) kicked in at that time. If a stock suddenly (magically) improves after the SSR kicks in as VXRT just did, what does this say? It means the selling was NOT panicking longs but primarily short sale-driven. INO just had the SAME thing. With any intraday 10% drop, shorts can no longer short on the downtick for rest of day or tomorrow per SEC rules. Yes, shorts can continue to short but it must be on an uptick (for this SSR period).

This stock is going to have a $30 haircut after Tuesday’s earnings call/
Solid slow strength today; will it hold???
"Load up $GILD guys-- This is the best cure available as per trusted Dr. Fauchi... This will be $100 soon. $BA, $LUV $JPM all will see much upside from here. GLA"
Someone smarter than I might be able to explain why JPM plunged when the Fed announced a rate hike and indicated three more in 2018. I certainly can't figure out why guaranteed higher margins result in the stock getting punished.
Is today a good entry or wait for 87? Support is at 87..
Charlie Scharf is the next Jamie Dimon. Wells Fargo will be the new $JPM of the next decade.

"Historically every bank with less than 20% capital has failed. JPM has 10% capital. I can quote this line and page from my economics textbook. Big names are defaulting on bank loans. Nieman Marcus, JCPenny, airlines, restaurant chains, movie theater chains, shopping malls, oil companies, universities, banks, sports arenas, shipping companies, cruise ship companies, hotels, commercial real estate...."

"Fed says no more cuts until the next cut. Meanwhile the Fed plows endless QE4eva into its TBTF bank coffers to cover up ""Mark to Fantasy"". It just doesn't get any better than this!"
I've been cash since February. Still waiting for the medical side to stabilize....the key part.
"So warren Buffet got out of JPM in the Q4 timeframe given that the 13F filing is as of 12/31/2020. So he got out in the $115-$125 range. Now interest rates have moved up, JPM reported stellar earnings, The FED said they could lower their bad loan reserves, they have announced a $30B stock buyback AND the stock has moved up $20/share (15%) since 12/31/2020. Nice timing Warren. Look, don't get me wrong , I respect the man and his long term record is quite good. But his most recent 5 year record doesn't even come close to the return on the S&P 500. So i certainly won't be selling my JPM stock based on what WB is doing."
Loan losses will baLOON. Buy this under $80 and hold.
So many haters of this stock on here...it goes up and they are still angry because they think it will go down in the future.

Making dubious 7 years forward predictions while the company has no business yet. I would NOT count on $JPM to be a credible source of stock tipps. If the market pulls back as a whole from world events you should have a chance to get back in attractively.I feel it will go below 35 and would be better fit to go in then if still an attractive company at that time.
My friend told me about #EPD yield better than #AAPL #JPM #NVDA and with energy sector moving up this is the best choice. I got more today on the pull back....$pread the words.
"Warren Buffet has made so many mistakes over the past 6 months and yet the media continues to say he is the best when he has lost billions in airlines and now banks if you look at his filing. He sold airlines and from his sell lint the airlines are up 12-15% from where he sold his shares in Delta and the like. Now he sold JPM in particular amongst other banks in Q2 for 92-95 a share. With all his selling and the stock is at 103-106 last week so he lost another 400 million by exiting and the stock went up over 10%. The airlines killed him because he sold at the low again and lost billions. If he stayed in the position he would have several billions more cut from his losses in the airlines. Lastly. Look at Goldman Sachs yet another sell on his list and this time he exited the financial stake u like JPM where he kept a substantial amount of shares. But the Goldman sell was another bad move because he sold and the stock is flying where at one point it was 227 after earnings. Talk about a bad move, he has made several bad moves with selling and he always preaches buy instead of sell when things are low. Imagine if he added instead of sold his shares in these companies. He would have made billions instead of losing billions. Not sure who is making these decisions on board but these are huge mistakes going against his principals of being greedy when others are fearful. Everything he sold is up. George Soros looks like a genius and he has been buying up JPM at these levels along with all of the major institutions and hedge funds that is why it went up when Buffett was selling and continues to go up."
target $75 by the end of 2018 .
JPM stock price is down negative 2.30 % in pre market ? People just dont trust this broker giving biased and inaccurate stock analysis .
"Jamie Dimon CEO of JPM said a while back to prepape to see horrible earnings for 2020. Then on the other hand analysts are saying it will be good because of the fed printing money.

My children were encouraged to 1) Live below their income. 2) Save money for rainy days. 3) Do NOT borrow money you cannot pay back. 4) Invest in stock mutual funds starting with the Total Stock Market Fund and build a portfolio from there including IRA's, 401K's, etc .

"You should not buy any big bank until the dividend has been cut , The FED has said they are hoping the BANKSTER's would do the right thing and cut their dividends on their own. But we all know BANKSTER's never do the right thing. So the FED will be forced to cut all the BIG BANKS dividends , because we know the Government is really in charge of the BIG BANKS after the 2008 disaster. So get ready Jamie to cut that dividend because the Government does not care what you think ."

"Something very dodgy is going on with JPM, retail investors do not buy this stock at these ridiculous, inflated prices. Do your research and you will see JPM is overvalued their revenues are flat y/y, it is similar to paying 5 dollars for an apple when it is really worth 1 dollar. There is definitely some insider trading going on here to prop up the price, just like when Kelloggs recently flew to 87 now it is 75 approx. based on a untrue rumor Buffett was buying Kelloggs. Honor and respect your hard earned dollars and don't let yourself get swindled."

"Conspiracy theory here.....looks like JPM traders and machines might be propping up the market to protect their share price from a tanking before stress test results and possible announcements regarding cuts to the dividends. Preventing a tank now might make space or reduce the impact of a further tank upon the announcement. If not JPM, then another finance company, maybe all working together. GS, BAC, C, JPM, who knows. But the way the price action is, fishy (banks and tech are some of the few up today, despite worse than expected jobless claims). Might be a sign of things to come."

"JPM issues A LOT of callable CDs and it has and is a big participant in the institutional CD market. Given the ""decline"" in rates, JPM will be calling most/if not all of its callable CDs. For example, last November I bought a Callable 15 month step up JPM CD; initial coupon 1.75; step 8/20 to 2.00. This CD is being called next week. Presently, a similarly structured 15M CD from JPM has an initial coupon: 0.50!Meanwhile online savings accounts offer 1.50 - 1.55. Most of the mega banks offering outrageous online savings rates are not currently participating in the institutional CD market. I imagine the high retail rate is offered with the hope of cross selling; something not available to these banks via the institutional money market arena. Long JPM for decades."

"How do the people who forecast earnings get it so wrong four quarters in a row, increasingly wrong, quarter after quarter? And because these totally incompetant forecasters hugely underestimate quarterly earnings, time after time, we celebrate what a great company this is. Earnings are GREAT because they beat the forecast? Instead of celebrating because the forecasters don't know what they're doing, why don't we get better forecasters? Don't know about you, but I would have been fired if I did my job so badly."

As an income stock, the yield has fallen to 2.35%, not bad, but certainly not top shelf in that category, you can do much better. I'm long, have been for many years. But can't see any reason for positive pressure on the buyer side."

"Why Bank of America stock price is so low today?BAC stock price manipulation crime warning, BAC actual price should be over $50/share I encourage all Bank of America shareholders NOT to sell Bank of America stocks now. The actual price should be at least over $50/share. I hope SEC will correct BAC price ASAP after the investigation.One super hacker has been secretly manipulating Bank of America (BAC) stock price, controlling its price, dragging its price down for the past five years from approximately middle of 2013 till present 09/2019. After 12/12/2016, his manipulation activity became more frequent. He has been obsessed with one lady and hates her to own BAC stock price and several other stocks. He made her other stocks either bankruptcy or became penny stock or became a few dollars stock. He can’t make Bank Of America bankruptcy due to the bank is too large and billionaire Warren Buffet is the largest shareholder.This hacker has been sharing the lady’s computer IP and all browsers at his computer and monitoring all her online activities. If you watch carefully, you will discover when all bank stocks price went up a lot in the past several years, Bank of America stock price only went up a little or even dropped down mysteriously for many times in the past. BAC shows very weak to go up while other bank stocks went up a lot. On a good earning date with good news, BAC stock price dropped down mysteriously while other bank stocks’ price went up a lot. I noticed such suspicious activity twice on earning report date.This hacker/stalker made BAC lost many chance to go up in the past while other bank stocks’ price went up a lot. I think SEC should correct BAC stock price to $50We have filed report on FBI ic3.gov and SEC.gov, but this hacker hacked into those government sites to delete all our reports. She mailed letters to FBI, SEC, stock company Chairman and attorneys, but this stalker/hacker hacked into USPS post office computers and transferred away her mails. He knows all her writings and her online searching activities through hacking her computer secretly. Trying to cover his BAC stock price manipulation crime, this hacker/stalker has been secretly manipulating several other bank stocks’ price as well. I hope someone will notice Bank of America all shareholders, investors including billionaire Warren Buffet and Bank of America headquarter CEO, JPM CEO, media , FBI and SEC for investigation this crime. Warren Buffet is the largest shareholder of Bank of America stock with 927,248,600 shares . It made him lose at least over $10B. But Mr. Buffet doesn’t know BAC stock price manipulation conspiracy. This hacker has destroyed millions shareholder’s finance and made millions people suffer financial loss and life misery."
meaningless test! ms gs are investment banks
Thank you all for responding to my question. 2.2 percent is pitiful but I needed other opinions than my own. I dislike annuities and this will help me help my buddy.
"Looking at the charts, there's really no solid support for this stock until 48 to 50."
I notice since last week that there are fake accounts spaming yahoo's forum.
I can only buy at open Monday. Good idea?
Finally some logic in this market
whenever fed does anything or says anything banks sell off. it raised rates all last year and banks were crushed. now all banks are benefitting. what gives?
"For Michelle Vogel, her condition improved rapidly after participating in the clinical trial. She had read that lenzilumab could help normalize her C-reactive protein and that is what she experienced. Just days later, she was weaned off supplemental oxygen and discharged from the hospital.“If I hadn’t pushed to see what other options were out there, I don’t know if the lenzilumab trial would’ve been offered,” she said. “Because of my professional experience as a patient advocate, I knew to keep on pushing to see what my options were. But there are many patients who don’t even know that they can ask what their treatment options are.”Sadly, however, Michelle’s mom passed away from COVID-19 while Michelle was in her own COVID-19 battle. “I tried hard to advocate for the best treatments for my mom but there were no clinical trial options at her hospital and it’s difficult to even think about whether she would have survived if she had access to a clinical trial.”"

Hilarious pre market up 2%. This market is really a joke now.
Next week bank earning reports worries me. They inflate market regardless numbers.
"Did I miss something, why did the banks hand over all their gains in AH?"
Crazy cheap at this level. It’s going back to $110 in short term.
Hope every body enjoying the dividend ! Certainly 3.41 better then 3.20 but only if sold. Hard to sell gem.Next side way then repeat.
Time to buy into JPM..
"Do we need Fed rates to rise significantly to see meaningful dividend increases with the Banks? I think, on a relative value basis, Banks are very much undervalued... but they seem to be so dramatically tethered to Fed Policy since days of the bailout it’s a little more challenging to value. Perhaps, the assumption that “rising rates in a bull market is good for Banks” no longer is the case? The market levels and prices may sound High / Over-Valued, but make no mistake the dovish liquidity over 10 years would without a doubt be expected to increase value of long securities. Minus a credit crisis, which does not appear imminent, this market has the steam to go higher 15 - 20%, this year, in my view. Folks, I’m not talking about 50% annual returns, I’m talking about a bull market that is at the reins of the Fed and has room to go."
They are always late. add up earnings ttm and you will find they are late in reporting that also.
Tech added 3.7T while banks lost billions...talk about sleeping sector

Dimon’s letter summarizes why I WILL NOT hold JPM. The view from NYC is crazy. It’s myopic. He should take care of banking.
I own 1500 shares of JP Morgan Chase. Average share price is 42.43 cost. Love my investment. Great dividend too!

"CNBC pounding the table again tonight to buy JPM.. Best in class. Too cheap at 1.45x tangible book..

Guy Adami and Karen Finerman pocked JPM tonight, and it was Tim Seymour last night.. good luck fellow Longs!!"
earnings are gonna beat they tryna advertise on cnbc to sell which means buy!
"why is JPM not rising, I believe in this company but what is happening? doesn't seem like a normal profit taking scenario"
Why are the first 14 articles and 3 videos on the JPM page all about gamestop? How is gamestop related to JPM?
Stock has dropped $10 so it may go up to $137 area. Good to buy here till $139 or so.
this one seems quite undervalued
it also keep interest paid on bonds low
Bought shares. Going to swing trade this when it hits $100 again. Seems range bound to me...

Heading to the $134s at the close.

this guy will crash the market tomorrow. believe it
"Tony has it right. JPMORGAN less than 2% off 52 week high. I guess $120 is in the can, it seems as new highs are hit, it runs for 4-5 days before profit taking hits stock price.A $125 print will stick option players. So maybe $124.88-98 as objective. If $125 prints, look for another leg up.Selling into new highs is as American as Tariffs and Lying presidents. Use the capitalist engine. Sell if ya gotta.Im holding for divvy and my retirement years."

It looks like somebody made a major option trade this afternoon. Bought 5600 June 95 Calls for $4.91 and sold 5600 June 95 puts for $6.91...…...This looks like a pretty bullish trade.
"Tight trading range, JPM cannot break out of this $104-$106. Looks to be dead money here, as JPM and most banks are not participating in this significant rally since December low. Maybe take whatever profit I have and buy something else with the potential to make money. Any thoughts?"

"People want to make change in any company in America , It's easy, The change does not come with unions, or with laws . The only and fastest way to make change is to vote with your money and not buy their products of services. Take AAPL people love them , but they are and have been part of the problem , How sells all kinds of products that the new generation loves to buy. but no one sees that they are one of the biggest causes of the down fall of the middle class. How massive new products that AAPL exported all the jobs to make them to China. Same with any company that has been awarded with more sales to export their jobs also. Maybe voting with your dollars will cause massive changes in how a company behaves and for sure how much they make. Yes if AAPL made their product in America it would cost more and AAPL would make less Billions and Billions . but just maybe that's not a bad thing. Just maybe that's a really good thing for America and not so much for Wall Street and the most loved company in America that has been taking advantage of the American people for years."

All my checks are showing people are starting to hoard money the first signs of a real recession. Time to get your 401ks IRA's and TSP's safe and out of the market. Worse case if I am wrong is you have to move back in , Best case If I am right on what I am seeing you save that great hit and maybe years trying to get back to even. We will know soon as it starts showing up in the data.

How long will the Fed allow these banks to continue parking hundreds of billions of dollars with the central bank and get paid interest on such deposits while paying absolutely no interest on consumer savings accounts. The Fed is allowing banks like JP Morgan a free lunch and what JPM and others are doing with their free lunch is rewarding shareholders and employees while completely screwing the American families who keep their money in bank accounts with these obnoxious banks. The FED needs to mandate that the interest rates it pays the banks flow through to the depositors at the banks who are the ones providing the free lunch to banks like JPM. Enough is enough

"I urge the shale oil bankruptcy Judges to consider how JPM helped finance the Aramco IPO. I urge the bankruptcy Judges to penalize JPM for helping bring down a large portion of American business, by enabling a company to compete directly against companies that JPM loaned money to before. The Judges should not blame shale oil alone for this disaster. Certainly any money JPM was paid by Aramco could be considered debt repayment by bankrupt oil companies. When you help destroy something, You, management and shareholders should pay, not innocent taxpayers and customers. And any Aramco bonus given to Jamie, and any other exec, should be clawed back. They get rich, while 5% of the country goes belly up ? That's not going to work."

JPM DIDN'T EARN $4.50 A SHARE. THEY EARNED $3.22. $1.28 WAS RELEASED FROM THEIR RESERVES. SO NOT A BIG BLOWOUT.
Banks ALWAYS sell off after earnings. Why anyone would think this earnings report would be different has his/her'head in the sand'. Wait a couple of days and add to position.

"Reuters said trump had a conference call during some recent market turmoil.So what. Is there supposed to be no communication when stocks rise and fall ? Was he supposed to go to the White House bunker and in case civil war broke out tIs reuters suggesting the system is rigged ?Well the truth is, the system is rigged. And its been rigged a long time before Mr. Trump was duly elected.Sadly, many corporations take investor money, and are now using it to further the agenda, instead of for their fiduciary duty to shareholders. O, you say the largest shareholders march with the agenda. Some do. Millions do not. It will be easy to start suing major corporations to start forcing them to act in the interest of most shareholders. If we can find any with any guts, and is sick of having his investment squandered."

Do you know how much I pay to know these things.
"With Dems back in WH, and potentially control of the Senate with the hundreds of millions being poured into Georgia races by liberal extremists living outside of the state of Georgia to try and buy the elections, the landscape for the largest banks is going to be much more riskier. Democrats believe that the big banks are evil and greedy, and that their sole purpose should be ""social justice."" There will be a lot more fines imposed on the big banks, and the federal government will extort huge payouts to the poor and minority business owners will result in much higher than normal bad debt expense over time. Regional banks in states not controlled by Democrat governors and Democrat attorney generals are the place to invest if you need banks in your portfolio. Insurance companies are also a place to look, such as PRU which trade at very attractive PE's, price to book, and have excellent dividends and history of significant annual dividend increases."

Why are bank stocks down today?
price action today seems to indicate a eps much higher than what is expected
Dividend
always sell before earnings and buy the dip after earnings
oh oh red again
The longer Mr Dimon talked the higher we went ! Don’t ya just luv JPM
Nice move!!When is /was the divi payout?
"Bank earnings are not rising sharply, even with rising interest rates, that create a good environment for them. There are many reason, but one has to do with salaries. I have friends recently retired from three different big banks. They get deferred compensation, in the 6 digits, for 4 more years, after they retired. So, huge salary costs, minimal oversight by boards of directors, are a primary reason for lack of bank earnings."
When do we get the dividend in our accounts.
Undervalued swan. Long JPM!
Buy this dip in JPM and get rewarded in the next 2 to 3 months. Bank is undervalued at $105.80
Kind of thankful for this virus it really shows what companies prepare for things like this and what companies don’t. $BA $WMT $MA $JPM $GM $TSLA.

(OPY)Summaryearnings up 68% in the latest quarter.stock buybacks are continuing.P/E going forward of just 6 !trading at only 85% of book value.Oppenheimer Holdings ($26.40 OPY) Tangible book value grows by 15% each year, due to strong earnings and low dividend payout ratio.Again virtually no one covers this name on the buy or sell- side since 2014; this is still why this is miss-priced massively.Record earnings out today of $0.86 for the first quarter up 68% from the same period prior.75% of their earning or $2.60 a share of their earnings today is stable interest swap income. If short-term interest rates stay between 2.30% and 2.50%. If they go above 2.50, they make even more money. So basically their core earnings today are like a regular bank.If earnings were going at a bank by 68% it would trade at 2.5 times tangible book, OPY trades under tangible book.Many significant funds like Blackrock own about 5% of the shares, so the float is about half of the 13 million shares that can trade each day.Many people think OPY is an investment bank when it is a right-sized asset management firm with a small investment bank on the side.With the current market so strong and IPO pipeline so strong they could earn as much as $5.00 a share this year and next. Next quarters earnings will be over $1.00 a share, that lowers the P/E to six, that does not make sense, it should trade at a P/E of 10 or more.They just moved their main office last year, and the rent savings will go to the bottom line now, also helping with earnings power going forward.Results the last several quarters have beaten any estimates, but no one seems to care.Even without incentive fee income, they are in much better shape from just two years ago, as short-term interest rates are way up and are staying up for the foreseeable future.Costs for technology upgrades also are now behind them which was a vast number, $65 million.Costs for 98% of regulatory and legal issues are now behind them.With the great first quarter market move, the biggest in over a decade, this will favorably impact their asset management fees for the second quarter of 2019.The main reason they are superior to their peers, even if the market sells-off again big in 2019, they now have a more stable earnings platform, as an everyday vanilla bank, generating about $2.60 plus in earning per share alone just on interest swap income, that’s there for many years to come. Most people don’t understand this is a considerable advantage to their peers.The risks they have to take to make numbers are much less than any of their peers.The CEO controls the voting so only he can sell the firm and owns over 22% of the stock.Downside risks as with any investment bank can vary and do, but OPY runs a tight ship for over 40 years.If short -term interest rates were to turn down sharply go under 1.50%, now about 2.40%, then this would hit their earnings by about 25%, but this is most likely this is not going to happen anytime soon. The most critical factor is going forward, stable earnings, that have a chance to expand actively if the market stays strong and deals keep coming.We would go long now today, under $26.50 and hold till it hits full value at around $50 in a sale or just fair amount of at least $45 a share.Valuations do matter even while they don’t seem to in today's world on many stocks, OPY has a cheap valuation, strong earnings growth, stable earnings underneath the growing part, proven management with a significant stake in the firm and they always add to their holdings and never sell.Since it is just a $337 million market cap company today no one is following this firm anymore in many years, but us. That is where the opportunity lies.Compared to any of its competitors it is about 50% cheaper right now. It has better earnings growth than any that I can find, and they are growing faster and have more stable earnings power.The company still has over 200,000 shares left in there stock buyback, and they have paid higher prices already this year than it is trading at now.I am sure they will buy shares substantial soon and add a new buyback, as it will grow book and earnings handsomely from these levels. The downside is limited from these levels as well due to these factors.They are adding about $1.00 to book value every quarter going forward from here, that alone is all you need to"

"JPM cannot hold $115 for more than a day or two, LETS GO investors where is my $118 and then my $123 price point! I have 1500 shares waiting for some real profits.

"I have no investment in ANY banks, but these prices are pretty compelling. However, I keep telling myself this, and maybe someone explain the fault in my logic.....When all these brick and mortar stores can't make their mortgage payments, that hurts the banks. When these brick and mortar companies like Sears, Macys, JCPenney, etc. go under, there will be foreclosures. The days of brick and mortar shops will NEVER come back from this. Everything will be online. When people lose their jobs and businesses go under so they have no job to come back to, they can't pay their mortgage....banks will foreclose. That can't be good for banks. Even at these prices, I can't pull the trigger and buy, because I still think it's going to get a lot worse for the banks."

"JAMIE DIMON'S LONG MARCH INTO CHINA (1404 EST/1904 GMT) Trade disputes and political regimes come and go but that is not deterring Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co, from sticking to his ambition to expand in China. Dimon said on Friday that the $1.5 billion JPMorgan plans to spend on business investments in 2021 ""includes a little bit inChina,"" despite the current tension between governments. Speaking to reporters after posting quarterly results, Dimon said, the conflict between the U.S. and China ""hasn't changed our goals."" He allowed that ""maybe the time table has stretched out a little bit. Obviously, it is going to be a lot more complicatedfor international financial companies going forward."" Dimon has been talking for years about how China is becoming a bigger market on its own and is increasingly powerful, both in the world economy and as a banking competitor to JPMorgan. He wants to make sure JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is involved. And, as with other multi-year expansions by JPMorgan, whether spreading commercial banking offices throughout the U.S.and in Europe or opening retail branches in new cities, Dimon does not want the bank to be a fair weather entrant who retreats after signing on new clients. Expansion in China, Dimon said, ""is a long-term investment.We're not making it based on a year or two. We're making it based upon decades."" COMMENT: China wants to eat our lunch and Jamie Dimon will serve it!"
"FWIW...""JPMorgan Drops Cautious Stance, Urging Buy the Dip in Stocks""""Investors should buy the dip in equities because government and central bank policies will counter the economic blow of the spreading coronavirus, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists who had previously been telling clients to trim risky bets.""From a Bloomberg."

"Things have changed in the last 10 years greatly. There have been programs put in place that should make some stock bullet proof even in a recession.

But Food stock with the changes in the Food stamp program and the credit card way they do it now just about any food stock that has been beaten up already and paying great dividends in a great buy at the prices they are trading. You have companies that will have customers weather people are working or not now. Another group that is now set is the Cell phone companies why the Obama cell phone plan you do not need to work anymore to have or get cell phones. Makes cell companies bullet proof in any slow down or recession they will have customers either way. People will be using their cell phones 10 time more once 5G is completely rolled out. Invest for long term and bullet proof with Government backed programs to support no matter what happens. Get your food stocks and Cell phone companies that have take taken advantages of the changes the Government has made for them. Ones that planed to grow , because they have programs from the Government that cover their backs on any slow down or recession."

"It is easy to say it's a fools game to ""time the market""; however, it doesn't take a genius to look at a a bit of history over the last one hundred years of the stock market to realize that ""all time highs"" is not the right time to start adding positions in stocks; any stocks. There is going to be a 15-40% correction within the next few years. It ""always"" happens after one of these 2 year ""super""run up periods. Don't take my word for it - just check the history of the stock market. My advice: Sell your big winners, no long term bonds, build short term CD ladders to get a little something on your cash, and be patient. The next good buy opportunity for blue chip stocks will come much sooner than most people realize. When you get a 15% correction, put 1/3 of your cash to work. When you get a 20% correction, put another 1/3 of your cash to work. Save the last third of cash in case that 20% turns into a 2000 or 2008 type of rout (40% routs happen rarely, but do happen). Also, when these 15-20% corrections hit; don't buy right away. Allow the corrections to take a foot hold and stabilize (usually 6-9 months into the correction will work); then put your first 1/3 cash position to work. Waiting will minimize the ""falling knife syndrome"". Concentrate on blue chips. Nasdaq high fliers rapidly become low fliers so stay away from new company tech stocks and small caps during this period (opportunities to add positions in these will come a bit later). Always keep in mind two of the most useful words ever coined for investing in stocks: ""Buy Low""!!!!!!! Don't let any CEO make you sit on your stock positions when all instincts tell you that the stock prices are too high. Let history be your teacher, not some CEO. Pearls Gen Z'ers - I'm giving your pearls. The philosophy above has worked for me since 1978 when I bought my first position in GE. Lastly, it is Just fine to sit on cash for a while and wait for the next big inevitable downturn. It will happen."

It is somewhat funny that JPM stock went down around 5-7% on spoofing charges and around 900 Mill in fines while Citigroup stock lost almost 20% on 900 Mill error and so far unknown regulator charges. Of course it is nice to be an industry leader but it is a clear sign that the market is separating strong hand vs weak according to its quantitative logic. Along with Wells Fargo Citigroup is a weak industry participant. All this thanks to somewhat passive and uncompetitive strategy from the management team. Honestly I do not know why shareholders should expect something different from a veteran insider. My question on Janes's participation in coming earnings call to shareholder relationship was left unanswered.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the U.S. Department of Justice charged a handful of JP Morgan Chase & Co traders in 2018 and 2019 with alleged commodities futures manipulation, it wasn't the first time the government had probed the bank's metals trading activities.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigated the same business as part of a similar probe of the silver market years earlier, but it was not able to build a case with the data it had at the time, according to U.S. court filings and a person with knowledge of the aborted probe.Since then, leaps in the agencies' data analysis capabilities have enabled them to detect and prosecute increasingly sophisticated forms of manipulation in the commodities futures markets which for decades have gone under-surveilled, according to ten officials and industry experts.The Justice Department fraud division is beefing up with the creation of a sub-unit specializing in combating commodities fraud overseen by Avi Perry, a trial attorney who has prosecuted high-profile cases involving trading powerhouse Tower Research Capital, Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc, and the ongoing JPMorgan probe, according to two sourcesThe unit is also hiring a handful of additional trial attorneys, according to the sources and online job postings. A Justice Department spokesman said the agency intends to fill the positions ""promptly"".The unit is part of a broader Justice Department initiative to dramatically expand the scope of market manipulation the agency targets for criminal prosecutions, beyond traditional insider trading and futures manipulation into a range of asset classes, sources told Reuters.The effort, if successful, raises the stakes for traders with potential jail-time, while"

"Third quarter earnings are expected to grow 21% with revenue up 7%. Estimates for the following quarter tend to come down during earnings season as companies set the bar to an appropriate level, leaving room for upside three months down the road. The last two quarters broke that trend from recent years as economic growth has accelerated and lower taxes boosted profit expectations.Despite stellar first quarter results, only 47% of stocks traded higher following their earnings reports, indicating that the good news may have already been priced in to equities. Bears refer to the current situation as peak earnings based on the idea that this is as good as it gets and these growth rates aren't sustainable. Another concern heading into earning season is the impact of tariffs across industries and uncertainty regarding a trade war. This morning, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jaime Dimon said the US consumer is healthy and business sentiment is high; trade war fears are affecting psyche but not activity.Looking at 2018 as a whole, earnings are expected to grow an impressive 20% with sales up 7.5%. That comes on top of 11% earnings growth with revenue up 6.5% in 2017. Earnings and sales are expected to grow across every sector.According to S&P Capital IQ, the S&P 500 trades at 18.3x adjusted earnings estimates for the year or 17.7x on a GAAP basis."

You get no special treatment unless you are a veteran, and earned it. But we can't have people taking advantage of companies either. Fair for both employee and employer."
"LMAO I called it. JPMorgan and all the big banks are the real fraud, none of whom went to jail for all the massive BILLIONS of dollars of fraud and money laundering that's happened, or for the housing bubble. ""JPMorgan (JPM) is changing its tune on bitcoin. Despite CEO Jamie Dimon calling the cryptocurrency a fraud, the bank is looking to allow clients to trade bitcoin futures. This comes about a month after the CME announced plans to launch bitcoin futures."""
135s today! Looks like going to get some downgrades coming fast.
Anyone stating they are smarter than another has pride issues and that in itself should not qualify anyone for president. Lack of humility is a big problem in the US and especially with white collar level. This divided country is starting to feel pain that is intensifying. Need to get back to we the people not me and only me.
Sell why someone still wants to buy soon there will be no buyers the up cycle is now ending and a new down cycle is starting. Time to sell the rips and don't buy the dips or you will get stuck holding all the way over price stocks.
$105 by Friday watch
JPM is lending money to companies for share buybacks. The loaned money has no collateral from the companies. This will be the reason for the collapse of the USA economy FAR greater than 2008/09 or even 1987 etc. or the NASDAQ crash of 2000. This is my opinion. This is far worse than mortgage crisis.
30% ish beat?? I’ll take it!!
I think we see a big up day in financials tomorrow
"I'm somewhat surprised that BRK ""exited its positions in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and PNC Financial.""I remain long."
JP and GS I believe will be the leaders of the future banking- exclusively digital and AR+AI running most of the business in the background
Sold half of my Jpm shrs. Great day at111.15 will sell more at 117.00
"Well Coco I hit the dividend, as did you but missed the buy back by almost 50%. not real good"
A few other banks trading at low P/B will benefit a lot more from buybacks. I'd rather see JPM use it to create a price floor than to inflate the stock.
"Guys and Gals...lot's of talk about the PPP running out but, don't you think Trump wants to get reselected? He has kept on talking about is how he has been in charge when the stock market has increased. He wants the markets to go up and they will be announcing a new PPP shortly. No way is Trump going to ease up during an election...I'm surprised the banks are not doing much better as they have proven to the doubters that they are much better organised than back in the CC."
I give this half a trading day to reverse back up..
"High possibility JPM cuts dividend, if that happens, maybe all banks will follow. Share your thoughts."
This needs to go down like 1-5% to keep pushing up. Its over bought.
Sell the end of the world is near
Last split 2 for 3 in 2000...….Long overdue for a 2-1 split....
Why aren’t bank stocks getting crushed ? The bond yield curve is way inverted this morning. Look at the 3 month verses the 10 year ? Who’s propping up the bank stocks ? Run people run !
"JPM dropping midday. It appears nothing will push this stock higher. When it announces record earnings in July, I wouldn't be surprised if it fell another four percent, as it did when it posted record earnings in April. I have lost all hope."
Shorts upset
"Does JP Morgan and other banks constantly take cocaine money? We never heard about what happened last July to the JP Morgan ship that was busted. These banks get bail outs, break the law and no one gets in trouble."
Banker mob bosses Lloyd Blankfiend and Don J. Dimon are scheduled to have a meeting this week to offer deals to each other that can't be refused. Please trade accordingly.
Aren't there multiple gaps belowin JPM which usually fills its gaps?Why is Dimon's mouth in gear on rates? Not just to tell JPMers to prep...Prices in general... is this the usual early Sept. pump? for the later dump?Are we revisiting any highs made when big guys were on vaca? can't tell.How many bankruptcies did Trump preside over? Do they color his views on rates???among other financial calls.
boooommmm...4-1 split coming...big divy increase..and $200++++ in sight!!!!
why are all the banks selling off while market goes up after the sector delivered great earnings???
May be time for a split 3:2

Bullish on banks
"A gift. Best bank. Period. Own it, don’t trade it at these valuations and sleep well at night."
strong buying at the day's highs is a good set up for another positive day tomorrow.
"Jpm has had good performance and good news , such a big bank worldwide even through a possible recession banks always win"
Red is more like it
"JPM ready to generate a positive MACD buy signal. A play on higher interest rates, I believe. Every 1/4 point of FED tightening positively hits the bottom line EPS. JPM has a strong downside bid from institutional holders. Retirees, I've moved more to JPM within my Empower account. JPM could also bode well for Dow30. Given the jump in volatility please do your own research. Just one man's opinion..."

This drop makes no sense. Looks like we are oversold here so I see this as a buying point. I'll be adding... Good luck
"JPM donates to the left. They do it out of fear, so that if the left wins, they won't get gutted.Yesterday, Biden said he wants to end the era of shareholder capitalism. Why in the world does JPM donate to the party that will take us socialist, and make your stock worthless."
"JPMorgan Chase cash on hand for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 was $1,327.019B, a 50.37% increase year-over-year..... What are they going to do with that - Launder it for the Cartels?"

 The great Trump stock market keeps hitting new highs Guess Why? Give this great Trump stock market another six months under President Trumps leadership.

"I am a retired JPM Chase employee and well schooled in finance. Today's Yahoo Finance hit piece entitled ""How the Trump economy went south"" by Rick NewmanSenior Columnist,Yahoo Finance•October 19, 2020illustrates fake news. It criticizes President Trump's performance without attribution to the pandemic. Were this about President Obama under similar circumstances, the title would have been ""How President Obama'sEconomy is making a miraculous comeback"". Yahoo Finance together with most of the media cannot acknowledge that President Trump has dome some remarkable things such as putting the American people, workers and our economy 1st in enacting his policies. He has rebuilt our military and created and effective foreign policy that has begun to put the middle east on an early path to peace. He has forced our allies to meaningfully start paying their fair share for their own defense and along the way reduced the uncontrolledentry of illegal immigrants into our country. President Trump is NOT A POLITICIAN and the United States, save the pandemic, is better-off today than we were four years ago. It is about time that business people in this country acknowledge that we need business trained people running our country, states, counties, cities and school districts rather than politicians and academics. Business people know the meaning of performance, politicians do not!"

With Trump he is starting to bring jobs back to America for ALL Americans and it shows in the jobs numbers today for sure it's good to be a steel worker again. With the DEM's I am sure it's not going to be good to be a banker or a hard working American Why because they are only out to that your money and give it to all the illegal aliens pouring across the border. WOW has the DEM party fallen. Get the Banks WACKO Warren, CRAZY Cortez and MAD Maxine ."

"Jamie is right about the rest of 2020. I do, however, believe our politicians and the FED will do everything they can to sustain the false economy until November 3rd. If they don't they stand a good chance of being voted out. At the same time the US will continue to do a poor job in getting the virus under control. So, the false economy will be sustained and the core problems not solved. So, what happens after November 3rd?I also believe that if DT isn't re-elected on November 3rd by the voters he will challenge the results just as it happened in Florida in 2000 resulting in the Gore/Bush decision by the Supreme Court. This is going to happen again on a much larger scale with DT claiming fraud and interference. This country is headed toward becoming another banana republic faster than most could believe."

"Three cheers for the President Trump economic miracle. The U.S. economy is the strongest in the world and it shows no signs of slowing down. On Friday, another incredible economic report was released as the September unemployment rate dropped to 3.7%, the lowest since 1969. Among Hispanics and Latinos, the unemployment rate was only 4.5%, the all-time lowest level in history, while among African Americans, the unemployment rate was 6.0%, near the record low. Why as former conservative Democrat and now a Republican I voted for President Trump and will again in 2020. Excellence is never an accident."

buy worth 115-119 in my opinion
Amazing how market focus on if CEO ready to hide bad stuff and focus on good stuff or give reality.We all know JPM has best CEO out there but he does not believe in inflating stuff even when it benefit him personally. So market will hate that.For example JPM has $34B reserve for bad loans. Not sure if it enough but that should lower risk signficantly.I really hoping that financial go down so I can convert my entire portfolio to Finance only. Reason:- Simple regardless what happen to economy financial going to first in and first out. Without them economy can't recover.
all the bank rallys are being sold. They have too many bad loans on the books and more to come
tomorrow is going to crash big
what is wrong with this bank?

"Gonna get into a couple bank stocks. I have shunned them for years and years because I have preferred businesses whose business is straightforward- they make something and sell it. Banking seems to me an artificial business largely built around the economic policies that the government happens to operate under.But it seems like the policy environment is pretty stable and the banks seem to be pretty reliably able to make money, and I don't get the impression that interest rate shifts pose much risk of major impairment of bank profits.So I'm getting in. But which ones? Barrons had an article about them, and I kind of gravitated toward two. JPM and C. I know Citibank was a big mess in the past but it sounds like they are pretty much back on solid ground.One thing I liked about these two is negative enterprise value. But I'm not familiar enough with this industry to know whether that is indeed a virtue of these (like it would be in most businesses), or if it is just an artifact of different ways in which the banks show their financials. In terms of ""different ways of accounting"", I see one bank showing most of its liabilities as accounts payable, and another as ""other liabilities"". I would guess that since they are similar businesses that is simply a case where there's more than one way to document those liabilities. I would guess what those liabilities are the balances accountholders have in their checking or savings accounts with the bank. Anyway, you will be able to tell I am a greenhorn as far as bank investing. Curious what JPM shareholders feel about the other banks, if you own other bank stock(s) than JPM, which ones and why?"
Buffet sold this for a reason. Dimon hasn't bought for a reason. JPM is a STRONG SELL!!!

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of Republican former U.S. national security officials are forming a group that will back Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, people familiar with the effort said, in a further sign that President Donald Trump has alienated some members of his own party.The group will publicly endorse Biden in the coming weeks and its members plan to campaign for the former vice president who is challenging Trump in the Nov. 3 election, the sources said. It includes at least two dozen officials who served under Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, with dozens more in talks to join, the sources added.They will argue that another four years of a Trump presidency would endanger U.S. national security and that Republican voters should view Biden as the better choice despite policy differences, the sources said."

You folks say this share should be priced around $200?
"Here is my analysis and why such unexpected happen after market simple 5% flash crash (Normally it go up 3% in one day and so 5% is not that serious).So We all know info go quick. Everyone know Volatility going to raise and so everyone try to exit similar time. That increase no of contract $XIV and other need to cover.Now here is where problem is. Normally they find big enough player to buy for 5-10% premium and so loss is very small. This time they haven't found anyone (I will put why in my contradiction theory). So they found buyer that wipeout 90% value overnight only and VIX jump because of this. Worst case scenario played out.Now My contradiction theory.Reason:-1.> Trade happen right at close. Which mean someone knew and ready with buy order of that size to match sell order so it quickly execute. 2.> It all most wipeout entire value but not gone negative of $SVXY & $XIV (Both endup with $4 NAV)3.> Bond market already reverse bigway main reason for market drop & so Market going to recover as well.4.> VIX unlikely remain that high, You need few billions and almost gureenteed profit. There are lot of big fishes out there and it consider peanut in today's market term.5.> Biggest holders said they have hedge and not suffer any losses.So What is my contradiction TheorySimple:- Trading revenue keep going down because volatility remain lower. This make harder for big firm like $GS, $JPM, $MS, $BAC,$C and other to make profit. So They plan entire event. First starting with Sell off and then determine exact price where inverse VIX wipe out. Knowing there is billion to make and yet finding buyer who only ready to buy at price that remove all most all equity on such fund everything is well planned and executed.Benefit:- 1.> Bring volatility back (Volatility Index double in seconds, Never happen before) This mean big player will make billions in trading.2.> Long term reason for low volatility gone. Since this index fund always gone up, lot of retail using as profit instrument and holding very long term. Now such fund not going to become big enough that it impact and run market volatility low.In other word Big player win big time. They all make billions from these index fund, able to reverse their trading profit and remove long term volatility killer.All retail investor suffer big big time.( If you short or long put then overnight lottery but they know how to take that money back)"
Hold it for 10 yrs ...
"Thank you Jamie diamond! I picked up 4000 in sept at $92! Best part is jpm is paying me $1200 a month, in divs to make this 40% profit. Lol! This is the best! So rich!"
Another excellent day to add the best bank in the world to your portfolio..
This casino gamble bank will get a hit when the stock market is crashing.
Not that it matters what I think but I think we hit 98 tomorrow. Logic. This was up before stress tests. Now that we know it won’t affect Jpm really officially I think it runs back up. Seems like market is looking for any reason to buy a stock right now.
"JPM up on the back of GS & MS earnings. Dollar weakness today though. Momentum indicators not pointing to new highs, yet..."
$102 open dropping down to $94 up to $95.5 then down again to $92.30 mark my words
JPM! C'mon!!! rise!
"How about Marko Kolanovic warning people that the lockdown may kill more people than the virus.Its really nice to see the truth coming from a company that marches to the agenda.Hey Marko, how about including suicide statistics over the last 5 years, until right now.How about some statistics showing the number of calls to suicide call centers for people looking for help.How about the number of people being treated for depression. You're the man Marko, maybe the only one at JPM. Please continue telling it like it is."
Jpm due to split 2-1?...last split was 3-2 in 2000...
I thought the earning was good. Why it stay flat?

Hey JP Morgan gold and silver prices are decoupling silver the most valuable asset class in the world is finally starting to move demand is unbelievable it is outstripping supply as mine shut down because of the virus or because they know the true value of what they produce and it’s not nearly enough at $14 an ounce paper price When you try to buy it on the open market it’s at least $20 an ounce physical market this is just the beginning by the end of this year $100 an ounce silver in hand is a real possibility.

"My Mother Is Smarter Than WarrenMay 5, 2020 7:14 PM ET|About: Arrow Financial Corporation (AROW), Includes: OPYSummaryShe says ""without your health you got nothing""She says "" All Things In Moderation.""She buys stocks and almost never sells them.My mother always said health is the most important thing over and over ""without your health you have nothing"" she said this over and over growing up. Today at 89 she still swims walks 3 miles a day. She eats almost anything she wants like a Warren. But always drank lots of cold water my cousin was a doctor and he always said drink 8 cold glasses a day, not sure why cold, but common sense says it cleaner then and tastes better cold for sure.He died in this eighties but was always in great health and in great shape as a surgeon you had to be.anyway, she always said do things in moderation, anything you want and you will be fine. She always read books like Warren, always investing in stocks like warren and usually never sold like Warren. She always bought value and held for the long - term out running in the woods today I saw the most people I have in 25 years, people of all ages no one running like me but at all hiking, it has been building the past month but today was crazy, so I think this virus will in the long run probably save 1,000,000 lives or more, people are so out of shape in the USA it is not funny you see kids in high school walking the track for their mile run day with sandals on if that was my kid I would have a heart attack, some schools no gym now, just crazy people get out there get in shape today period, no more excuses. Get out there today, stay healthy, and stay alive.But what really strikes me is people this weekend most driving in their cars by themselves all wearing masks today. But at the parks by me at least almost nobody has them on. So we really as a country we have lost our way.Airlines want you to wear a mask know, as things open up, how was this not mandatory or not being done the past 45 days. Everything is done backward, sideways, everybody has a different opinion. I have never seen something that seems simple, use common sense wear masks period if you go out. Yet our leaders don't wear them in hospitals, I really not sure what all this means yet other than massive USA debt for all. Even Warren Buffet said last night he has no idea how this will end but it probably won't be good he said. So, in fact, he sold stocks last quarter and bought none. Even his stock was much higher last quarter when he bought but he did nothing with this time, which means he likes cash more today. That is a statement itself.But there are always good values he said, so if you stay in your lane, don't buy on margin and buy when things are 30%-50% below tangible book, and the business is doing good, you should do more than fine.Remember what you pay is almost always the most important factor for your risk-reward and returns, but also so you don't get shaken out if you buy too high and it gets hit, usually, you get shaken out. You must stick to what you know and buy heavily when the time is right which is usually once every 5 or ten years.Right now the values are in the Smaller bank stocks and there are plenty, even Warren owns mostly banks, even thou they are the bigger ones, if he could he would be buying the smaller ones hand over fist today. Not all but just the select few names with the strong asset quality that have around been around 150 years like, AROW under $22 if it gets back there and OPY under $18.50 it is $18 today. OPY is 33% under tangible book value earning 10% return a year on its capital and they bought 409,000 shares back at $20.60 in march so in May they will buy many more. AROW, is just over the tangible book but earning like a 12% return on capital on a consistent basis for 100 years plus. These two are as safe as it gets at today's levels in an over-all high priced stock market.Douglas Hughes5/7/2020.Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. 854 people get AROW breaking news and analysis by email alertGet email alerts Comments 0 • Sort by Newest Bhughes7918 Add Your Comment: (NEW!

Looks like many are taking my advice today and dumping. Down again for the 4th straight day. Down $2.25 per share and another 1.62%. Both Thursday and Friday will be even worse than today. I think we are going to go at least 7 trading days in a row of down days then a baby up day and then down another 5 days in a row.

"The published case describes a 77-year-old Caucasian male patient with a past medical history of type II diabetes, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft, systolic heart failure, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with emphysema and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was admitted to the ICU in March 2020 for COVID-19 and put on respiratory isolation. The patient was treated with steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and bronchodilators for possible COPD exacerbation and hydroxychloroquine with zinc. The patient continued to deteriorate for the next 12 weeks with an increase in oxygen demand from continuous low-flow oxygen to high-flow and eventually intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during that time.At week 13 of hospitalization and multiple unsuccessful attempts at oxygen weaning, an emergency single use IND for lenzilumab, Humanigen’s Humaneered anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody drug candidate, was approved by the FDA and administered to the patient. Seven days following the administration of lenzilumab, the patient’s oxygen decreased from high-flow to low-flow nasal cannula and the patient was able to walk outside of his hospital room with physical therapy. Sixteen days post-treatment with lenzilumab, the patient was discharged from the hospital on home oxygen."

JP Morgan being accumulated with monster buys by institutional and hedge funds. Read recent article where this stock is a bargain at these prices. This is best in class with financials and has profitable ratings through this downturn that is when you buy. They will make money through this COVID era and emerge with high earnings and profits when this is clear. Josh Brown from Rithholtz said if there is a vaccine announced JP Morgan can jump 20% in an instant. Don’t mis out and keep accumulating. You will be rewarded handsomely. This will be back in the 130-140 range in less than a year if a vaccine is announced and there will be a huge pop on any good news. This is the gold standard.

US banks have long since become Soviet style banks. There are merely an extension of the deep state. And when they fail they are bailed out by their deep state masters. Privatize the profits and socialize the losses.

"If you're going to own a financial stock this is the one. It has the best CEO in the business and a portfolionext to none. And its employees are the best, also."

JPM ptions trading has been very heavy last few days. Options traded represented almost half of average daily volume of the underlying stock.
"Should start running up, now that earnings scare is behind! Where else will you park money other than safe JPM!"

"As I skimmed an article regarding regional banks and the amount of tech investment they must make, I came across the following nugget:JPM's assets grew by $699B in 2020. The seventh largest bank/bank holding company's asset size? Approx. $699B. YIKES!"
The hills are alive with the sound
hey pops. do you think all of those names might just be the same person

"Sold at $124. Plan to buy again at $81. Banks are going to take HUGE write downs, margins are down, as are capital market activities. Earnings tomorrow. Don’t expect anything positive."
JPM reached a 52 Week low at $97.14
"JPM...what can one say, it has a p/e of 11.7, it made tons of $ (even if you reverse the loan provisioning) and yet it is $3-5 shy of pre-announcement levels. Its balance sheet is rock solid. Is this ""soccer gate""? Mercy me. Not feeling too good about JPM."
"covid-19 new death decline,that means covid-19 began to weak,it will be end soon, so it's time to buy bank stock now,"
Big money moving into Apple and JPM today.
"JPM has large exposure to oil. According to an environmental group, $196 billion in loans from 2015-2018. Banker of choice for fossil fuel industry. That was close, I was about to open a position."
This could be the best stock in a horrible sector. Doesn't mean it's a good buy. Banks are like the oil sector. Neg rates seem to be coming. Yesterday seems like a dead cat bounce.
I hope tomorrow is much better

Dow up over 200 and bank loan losses mounting. How paradoxical! HAHAHAH! SHORT IT TO ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Fed is not being fair. Each Bank should be judged on its own strength. If it is strong it should be allot to pay its dividend
106 easy today
Negative interest rates sure are bullish for banks... LOL take a look at Europe!
Banks make more profits when interest rates increase and also when loan losses go down. These are main industry trends right now to end of 2021 at least and perhaps into 2022 too.
A trillion dollars per second fed pump won't even slow this crash down. They will just have to pull the plug on the whole thing. It will be much better after that.
Dow up 200 we're up .10¢ just don't get it.

JPM stock historically always tries to match the performance of S&P and has even done better for certain periods but then it falls right back.Currently S&P performance at 96% vs JPM at 53% since 2000 vs in December when S&p gave 114% and JPM gave 142 percent!!What does it mean? It means JPM may shoot up upto 40% in the short term.

I suggest buying PDD instead. They open down every morning and rise every afternoon. Plus, earnings are going to be awesome this month."
Seems banks bull run slow down. cant go up every day. break a bit. then it will move again.
JPM is finally ... up

JPM is helium.
our great bankers are spoofing the silver and gold markets

"It's ok guys let the bulls have their bear Market rallies. This virus will persist through summer. No where out of the woods. Q2 and,q3 numbers will be atrocious. Q4 will be weak too"

Dividends will be paid. Must own tomorrow 07/02/20 and can sell at your pleasure tomorrow. I own 800 shares and like the 90 cent dividend. Record date is 7/6/20 and will pay 07/31/20. Just bought 500 @ $93.36 so I did not get hit for the drop today. I like getting dividends like last quarter. Just hope the market does not crash and negate my $720 dividend payment on 07/31/20. JPM is best of breed in banks but been not trading higher lately. Going down a few cents as of now so I may buy more??LOL
"Thankful for this down day, bought my limit for the day ; calmly saving dry powder for any unexpected moves. Going with the market flow. cheer"
Who would short JPM going into an FOMC meeting? 2 PM EST today.

JPM 1 year target estimate should be raised to $140+!!!!!!!!!!!
If you sell your JPM stock and buy Citi you will have almost double the amount of shares and double the dividend which JPM is .91 cents to Citi 51 cent witch equals out to $1.02 per share for Citi Vs JPM 91 cents.
Watch for Warren to sell some JPM and buy more KHC. Why because KHC is a better and safer investment than JPM
Yield curve inversion just a few days away. This will tank banking stocks hard. They are selling off on the news
Jpm should downgrade itself
"Perhaps I reading this wrong, but I took the cash on hand and subtracted the debt and then I divided this by the number of outstanding shares of stock and arrived at a value of $132.40 cash for all outstanding shares. The stock is only selling for $109.24 which means the stock is 17.5% less than its cash value. This doesn't even include tangible assets. Now how could Warren Buffet pass on this one, well obviously he seen the light. The book value here is really off a lot and the price per book is les than one."
"billery and obummer will be bad history shortly and put out to pasture,so get on your knees and thank GOD for small and large favors.Oh yea...."
Does anyone know how much exposure to GE Capital JPM has?
"I pray to God that there will be a hard short squeeze in the physical silver market possibly making JPM insolvent which would be righteous. Big crooked redshield banks along with Jamie Demon will no longer manipulate markets for their own advantage. Btw, Trading Places comes to mind whenever Jamie Dimon’s name is mentioned. He deserves the same fate as Beeks or the Duke brothers. Similar crimes deserve similar punishment."
"Big bank stocks popped out the top of their Bollinger bands today. Big reverse hammer on the SPY. Hammer on SKF. Weakness ahead for the bank stocks now. When the realization hits that fin tech and blockchain are going to eat into their businesses and crush margins in the prime brokerage and wire transfer business, banks will fall hard."
recession started its not correction cash is king mark my words
Why would anyone ever want to buy JPM Obama bank when we know that the bank is not for all Americans because the CEO's views and bashing of the president. Why would any one ever want to own JPM Obama bank when it is run by the Government and will be told to cut the dividend in a down turn or recession. JPM does not control it's dividend the Government does.
this stock is killing me.
JPM is down 4.91% to 115.41

China owns Joe Biden. Better get ready to sell everything if he wins.
Buying JPM to hedge against rates!
Banks gonna take a little hit here. Look out below. 112 just around the corner. Look for resistance there.
Why still down 15% YTD?
Went all in today. Thought it was a good idea. Margin call only @$79. So feeling confident.
If our supreme leader raises the capital gains tax to the levels he wants will they just start trading from off shore or other countries where they already hide their money? They have to already be thinking of ways around it.
JPm = the best value in bank stocks..wayyyyyyyyyy undervalued..and large divy increases coming...
"No matter what the price or news is the US Market Makers start to PUMP Stock and Oil prices artificially every single day, starting from 9:30. Enjoy free capital gains without working!$XOM $JPM $TSLA"
$JPM will make more money and more securely off interest rate hikes.
1Q20 earnings will be fine. 2Q20 will be big. JPM will make big bucks processing all the Covid-19 loans. The money will get deposited in JPM bank accounts. The Fed buys 95% of the loans and thereby assumes 95% of the risk. Economy get back on in May. The economy fills in the dip in March-April by early 2021. My prediction
JPM is up 8.43% to 102.25

I think stock will come down after ER..
JP Morgan will be involved in underwriting the Saudis' Aramco ipo. Huge deal. Should be a shot in the arm I'd think.
Good luck with JPM you're going to need it ! Brilliant move by Buffett !

Fast Money Crowd = JPM 125 dollar stock and best in group......today we are leading the financials!!
I like banks at price / book below 1 but for JPM I won't bet on it and I may load at 100$
"JPM is Oversold and undervalued.We have manage to survive tariffs,higher interest and will survive and thrive through this market. You can't have a strong economy without banks. So don't listen to these dismal and pessimistic analyst who are bashing good companies only to low ball the stock price."
warren Buffoon is the cheese in the traphe sell JPM and GS to buy GOLD everyone knows JPM owns the silver and GS owns the gold
My prediction @ market close is $110.
JPM is preparing a 2 for 1 stock split.
Market could fall 20% from here.... i didn’t see it but at this point I think it’s a function of technicals.
So we're down because we won 23 extra cents from tax audits? I say more to us and less to them is a good thing. Buy.

Yet ANOTHER DOWN DAY FOR JPM... I think it's been almost 12 calendar days since the last time JPM had an up-day. I say we shoot for 20 straight days... There has got to be some really big money out there losing a freaking fortune. At some point this stock is going to make the headlines on CNBC as a stock that getting crushed....
Chino I told you I don't bother with bank stocks.
"Q1 earnings going to be 1/2 of forecast, but in this fake market shares will be up on the news."
"Most investors on this board are saying - terrible E and numbers, all banking will go down. NOT REALLY, what is wrong in your assumption it is bad for now and caused by rapid changes in economy. Since pandemic is slowing down, that drop in economic news may live a short time. Don't forget markets are still 20% down. Buying more soon."
Watch this stock run if the dividend is not cut.

Funny thing is, just two weeks ago everyone was talking about how strong banks were and what a good investment banks are and that everyone should add them to their portfolios. Amazing how quickly sentiment changes.I don't care about what some dolt from Harvard says. I don't care what Trump says. I don't care what any of you say. I don't follow crowds.

"JPM is hosting a healthcare conference in June. Perhaps they should be warning drug companies, that they will not be lending money to companies that push elective immunesuppressant drugs on people, during the virus pandemic. Just saw a coysntex ad from Novartis today on TV. Not very smart. We need a strong immune system to fight the virus. Why does the FDA allow these ads, and what doctor in their right mind would be prescribing them now. JPM shareholder should be worried about the future class action lawsuits, and how JPM is an enabler of bad actions, and perhaps complicit."

JPM AND WFC TWO BUYS IMO.
Ge is imploding !How much of ge debt is owned by Jim ?
US government debt payments are due in a few weeks. They are out of credit and money. Bond yields are dropping as countries we #$%$ off keep selling those bonds. The 10yr and 2yr bonds are about to invert and only .20 cents spread between the two. This will cause banking stocks to drop 20% more.
Buy or add BAC and WFC here are phi beta kappa moves. Good luck!
I am guessing everyone is running to the tech section still. lol

"The prison psychiatrist agreed with his defense lawyer that Epstein could be taken off suicide watch.When a psychiatrist makes a bed decision like this, or tells a judge, that with medication, a horrible person can be put on the street, and tells the judge he will take the medicine, and the guy doesn't, seems to me the psychiatrist should share a lot of the blame when things go wrong. Like manslaughter if a released prisoner kills someone, or being culpable in the case of Epstein. We were going to learn a lot of bad things about people who loved younger women on his island. And most people who love younger women are from the party of Universal Love, which is code, for lowering or even eliminating the age of consent."

Soon people will stop putting money in banks and negative interest rates means banks will have to pay the lenders from their share of profits as well as keep the rates lower for lending as demand will slow down.They will use dividends to give out interest rates to the depositors or they could all go cooperative by giving shares to depositors.
WFC and JPM will go to 6 % today.
Good time to buy $JPM? I want it to drop to the 70's
"...the financials under preformed 2018 for a reason, why would 2019 be any different especially given the market pricing in what looks to be a return to normal prices (without the benefits of tax cuts, and low lending rates, and slap on slowing global growth)there are better options out there for dividends and growth, and US banks are not any of them IMHO"

Has anyone else ever noticed that JPM always drops the last 30 seconds of the trading day. I'm going to preprogram a trade for Monday to see if I can buy and sell fast enough to take advantage of it.
"Markets have become a casino style gambling pits because the FED kept rates lower than where they should be. Lowe interest rates created a crisis of financial helplessness and uncertainity since the last 3 decades and it has been very high in the last decade. As we can see once Dow PE 15 was considered tops of the market and time to take profits, but now DOW PE of 21 to 23 was considered a bottom for the markets. So earnings that is 20 years out / away is good to pay for today. Best thing to do is to raise rates. Investors should stay out of stock...Republicans are getting desperate to restart the economy fearing the loss in elections, but they should rather show love and sympathy and win the election rather then push people to face dangers."

How safe is the dividend?
Wouldn't a stock split be nice?
"Just go to show how screwed up the CROOKED DEM's are and how much they don't know about business. WOW what a line up Nancy P staring WACKO Warren, Crazy Cortez and MAD Maxine. Not to mention Clueless Bernie and Chuck. If you really want companies to pay workers more It's easy just incent them to by giving them more writes off for wages. Give them double the write offs for wages and you will see wages go a lot higher and fast. But it just goes to tell you the CROOKED DEM's only want to get their hands on more money Why because the more money they touch the more they can steal."
anyone get the divi yet or are they putting in accounts tomorrow?
It’s all about the outlook and guidance and they both don’t look too good.
"When can we expect an update on capital plans, ie dividends and share buy back intentions for 2019?"
Great earnings stock is down. All earning already priced in

JPM will be severely challenged by a deteriorating credit quality and standing by their clients. NIMs remained depressed. We won’t see $150 for years. Hoping that don’t succumb to political pressure to reduce or eliminate their dividend which retirees depend on. Get ready for the onslaught of problem loans.
I’m not an owner of the stock but doesn’t it suck when your earnings beat and then they go down off of it... and also weren’t banks supposed to be bad this quarter?
Why are bank stocks tanking after JPM and Citi reported better than expected top and bottom lines?
"Lots of bears across all banking stocks, bearish sentiment through the roof. This is mostly likely a good time to buy based on sentiment. Let’s not forget the banks have reported very conservative guidance and loan default reserves. These banks are paying excellent dividends to wait for things to slowly get better. With the recent run in tech stocks, banks and real estate are most likely the best 6-12 month investments right here. Once the economy starts coming back, your looking at 50% returns on big banks and in regional banks 100% returns."
can someone explain the balance sheet between JPM and Apple. who has more cash ? i know appl has a higher market cap but who has more cash and less debt? thank you.
"JPM Balance Sheet is INFESTED with FAILING Loans, BAD TOXIC DEBT.. And they talk about others debt. Housing market is about to crash, taking down JPM's Balance Sheet along with it down the T01LET.."
bank earning peaked ... that is why
Can markets be saved? How? Money is in puts based on psyche!
negative dayyyyy
"JPM to $100 this week. Might take a dip after earnings on April 14 -- depends on guidance and covid-19. Seems to me, hydroxychloroquine with zinc (or antibiotic) is a covid-19 cure that is available now. I am very surprised that this treatment is not getting implemented faster. Persons with severe covid-19 will get this cure and be well within a few days."
This stock has no momentum!
"JPMorgan Pays $920 Million, Admits Misconduct Over SpoofingWhen are CEOs going to prison for this CRIMINAL ""misconduct""?CFTC said its order will recognize and offset restitution and disgorgement payments made to the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission.That keeps DOJ & SEC Fat - where WERE DOJ & FTC while the crime was happening?Wrist-slap ring around the Coronavirus... ."
Buy square or PayPal. Banks are dinosaurs.
If Jamie Dimon only had a heart...
Money rotating out of tech and into finance.
"Shareholders vote down JPM climate change disclosures. JPM biggest fossil fuels lender...Divest from this company, if you care about our future.People over profits."
"Shorting a company as powerful as JPM is asking to get hosed. Not a question of it will happen, it's a question of your pain tolerance. $1 trillion in cash and you honestly want to bet on this company going to 0?"

"Mark this, UP from here, Good luck"
"JPM P1GS MANIPULATING WITH GE PRICE, AMERICAN CROWN-JEWEL..."
Europe is the problem. Their economy is so bad that all their money is going into short term USA T Bills. They are terrified of putting their money where they live. Thus an inverted yield curve. Not serious we just need lower interest rates from the Fed to stop this Flow of Money from the rest of the world.
With current market conditions - $AAPL may be heading to 330 or 320 and $TSLA to 750 - 700 and $JPM to 88.
Does anyone here know at what price Buffett bought JP Morgan shares? Fact please.
John Travolta was hospitalized yesterday but released today. Turns out it wasn't coronavirus just Saturday night fever. He will be staying alive.
"I had been wanting to change my payment date on my Chase Visa to match other cards to make payments easier, slow at work so today I called and JPM was so worried about losses they offered to cut my amount owed by 50 % if I paid today. So I did and they wrote off 50% and I went short JPM stock 5 minutes later. Word to the wise 1. Don’t pay your credit card- you don’t have to anymore 2 don’t pay your mortgage- it’s free now too and short JPM"
"'The fault line is inequality': JPMorgan's Dimon calls on fixing America's 'self-inflicted' problems......In life there are people who work hard and make great decisions and those who do not get educated and make bad decisions. I think if Jamie Dimon feels so passionate about inequality he should donate $100 million of his own money. Personally I am so sick of CEO's and liberals talking the talk, but not walking the walk."
"What Dimon knows, and is afraid to say, is that as jobs are created, then many new loans will be originated. MILLIONS. For crying out loud, many new jobs have only been created in the last year. They can't borrow, until they have several good months of pay, and credit score increases. Dah. Since he is afraid of Pelosi and socialism, he has to walk a tight rope, on who he gives credit to."
good day
"JP Morgan looks like the Canary in the Coal Mine that just ate the Cat. Recession is probably 18 months away.......with complete Gridlock in Washington, this Bull Market chugs along. :-)"
Don't buy Citigroup their CEO is screwing the shareholder by running the stock prices down on their buyback.

"nothing, just keep adding more shares.."
VOLATILITY.
"I know it's not fashionable to do a stock split anymore due to being a big influencer on the indexes, but this is traditional 2:1, 3:1 split territory for JPM... Any rumours on doing this, or is it just ""old ways of doing business"" now?"
zero interest rates or trumpie calling for negative rates is not good for banks. No spread to make money
"JPM gave 157,000 to the top 10 2020 democratic presidential candidates. Wouldn't it be great, if their donation, your money, will help Sanders make the US a socialistic state ? Many of Sanders mentors and allies loved Chavez. Apparently they love poverty for all, in a country where you cant even buy toilet paper and diapers, much less find them. In Venezuela, Generals run banks and businesses. Wouldn't it be great if a General ran JPM, and Dimon, who used your money to help Bernie, was out on the street, bumming coins. By the way, when a general is running JPM, your stock will be worthless. Maybe you want to ask Dimon why he apparently likes socialism."
Hey longs: It's time for you to grease up and bend over. This is going to hurt bad lol. See you under $50 by August. Thanks.

Profit falls 69%!!!!!!!!!
"bank stock earnings peaked, it's p/e should return to under 9, bank stock from Fed policy, but trump doesn't like Fed's policy, so bank stock p/e should 7,"
"JPM has confirmed that earnings will be announced 04/14/2021. The consensus earnings are $3.06, with a high and low of $3.55 and $2.75, respectively. The mean has trended upward from the last estimate of $2.93."
Hedge fund pumping the stock up after 69% decrease in earnings. I hope they get smoked and loose a ton of money. Lol

By my calculations the intrinsic value of the complay is about $90 a share so warren payed 11% higher so i think he made a good call with interest rates Rising and dividend yield at 2.88% witch is lower than us Treasury bonds at 3% but JPM is growing book value at aunnal rate a 5% so i say it was a good investment for him

so why the abrupt Hight this morning .. and then now it's dropping?
this stock is way oversold
Is JPM down on the likelihood of a Biden victory? I owned in the past and am considering buying again since interest rates are likely to increase during a Biden Administration. Is my logic flawed? TIA
I started buying JPM last year on a whim that banks will outperform the market. I will put a hold on buying JPM for now and move back into mining stocks given current conditions.
Think we ll see a pull back next week.. More pain for banks.. still too early w many loan defaults that can’t be properly analyzed.. Nice run up Friday but it will hit 85-87 range again.
I am now overweight PLTR and looking forward to tomorrow. I think markets will finish strong this week. Get out of cash. My $MS $GS $JPM $BAC looking good too. Buying banks at the bottom of the curve is prudent. Five year holds on all mentioned.
You know a feller could live on a 3.5% div.

TRUMP made RECESSION
"Normally, I'd be confident trading JPM and have made a decent $. This time I have to stay on the sideline. It seems like the trading range will change. It was $85-$95 range before. Let's see how it shifts. I don't really care about 1-2 year projections."
My next door neighbor Bill Clinton has a Daughter that hates Trump like her dad and mother do.... So I asked: How are your investments doing the past 2 years ? .... Daughter replied better than ever I can't believe how well - my mutual fund is up 44% in past 2 years. Nice I said and then asked: When did Trump take office - she had a blank look on her face - didn't know what to say! I said looks like Trump is doing what he said making America Great and you Richer.
a whole bunch of Form4 docs filed @ 127.07 !!

"After watching Blankfein’s interview today it is apparent that we live in a world where this antithesis between the bulls and the bears, between $MS and $GS, between $JPM and $BAC is heating up. It will be interesting to see which predictions prevail over markets. This established duality, between the two worlds, between the protagonist’s two identities, between the bulls and the bears. This idea of duality, or better yet, dichotomy, is an important one throughout the past few weeks, as it is precisely this dichotomy that has allowed for intense speculation in the markets and behavioral pondering between market participants, what is real and what isn’t? Who will capitulate first?"

"Donald Trump did a interview on CNBC when he was running for President the 1st time in 2015. He was asked about the stock market in that interview. He said it was a big fat bubble waiting to burst. Fast forward to 2020 and now he wants us to thank him for the 40% gain in the markets. It's no longer a big fat bubble? The Feds have flooded the markets with liquidity and inflated the markets. In the near term, expect a deep market correction, a rapid increase in stagflation followed by the collapse of the dollar. I guess all that wont be Trump's fault."

I strongly urge the SEC to look at the Roundtable companies, and delist any company that violates SEC fiduciary regulations. The big problem is, why in the world are you investing in companies that don't give a rats behind about your investment, or you."
I wonder what is brewing under the surface with JPM risk exposure. Watching.

"Jamie Dimon scam artist 60 Minutes continued. Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase with an estimated worth of $1.4 billion, is the poster child for corporate greed and criminality. He directed JPMorgan Chase to underwrite fraudulent securities in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crash. He overcharged members of the military on mortgages and mortgage refinancing transactions. He overcharged customers for overdraft fees. He manipulated bidding on California and Midwest electricity markets. He overcharged homeowners for flood insurance. He billed customers for nonexistent credit card monitoring services. He charged minorities higher rates and fees on mortgages than those paid by white borrowers. He failed to pay overtime to company workers. Yes, JPMorgan Chase had to pay more fines than any other financial institution in the country, but the profits more than offset its fraudulent and criminal activity.It is Dimon, along with fellow oligarchs Gates and the billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, who has recently led the attack on Warren. Dimon chastised her for her “wealth tax” plan and for allegedly vilifying “successful people.” Cooperman accused Warren of seeking to wreck the American dream. Gates also denounced her wealth tax plan, although if he did have to pay the tax, he would still be worth $6 billion. When questioned, Gates refused to say whether, if Warren becomes the Democratic nominee, he would support Trump."

I love to short JPM: biggest fossil fuels lender.
"Feds propping up corporate debt with more debt. When this thing finally explodes bigly, Feds are goin to resort to negative interest rates. Watch bank runs take out the banks then.

see a triple bottom breakdown on the charts ~~ heading to 97??
BAC earning will move us on Monday
UK futures down 790 points.
The 1 year target estimate for JPM should be raised...to say 115..at least?
Buy big banks. Democrats+ Yellen you =INFLATE. They're gonna paper over the big banks debts and send money to people directly so they can pay their debets/intrest to the banks.

Banks have many ways to make money. JPM running on all cylinders. I am expecting an earnings surprise and an outlook surprise. Looking for 115 by next week.
Heavy profit taking will happen today lock your profit as JPM has one of the best winnin streaks straight 7days

"Wells Fargo WFC bet holographic AR technology stocks track, WIMI Hologram attracted the attention of well-known banks and brokerage institutions."
I don't believe the current valuation reflects JPM's large loan loss reserve. If the vaccine campaign is successful in bringing back the economy those reserves will be released adding to EPS/buybacks/dividends.
