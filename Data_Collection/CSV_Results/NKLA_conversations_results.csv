Trevor Milton on Drugs :)
Almost people something big is going to happen
wow $NKLA is trading closer and closer to below $10 milestone. following other spac's already below $10

Institutions have abandoned the co. Insiders selling like crazy and cash decreasing rapidly is the reason the co won’t make it. I plan to cover when it reaches 5.
Anyone see it spike to $15.77? Or was that a glitch
"bashers don't need to bash this stock any more. this is the lowest we can expect this stock to go. the company will start delivering tangible results, which is what it was blamed not to do till now. it has to use the cash at hand to deliver."
Last chance to buy and hold
how much interest can short keep paying?
"Two chances, slim and none, that NKLA hasan operating profit in next 3 years.Trevor Milton, is the modern day Angelo Mozillo."
"Overreaction - Sleepy Joe created a dip, jump in, this offer would not last long. $NKLA, $HYLN"
Look ma...no cables!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpQ0Cm5tBRU

If this can’t make it now earnings will be tough
"Never sell under $20, ur welcome."
"Stock road 5$ ,then 1$.Im sorry because im fan of Nikola ."
The bubble finally burst
$4.8B market-cap; easy takeover now......Hydrogen is the future........Added more shares..........
they already running out of cash before production and spending more on lawyer's fees for both the comoany and trevor meltdown. they promised too much without even the capabilities. perfect recipe for more lawsuits and bankruptcy.
"All the new players in the EV market are risky this is a fact, and a few might not be successful as others.. now all the below didn’t really start selling and make real revenue. From all the below XL from a market cap point of view is the most lucrative option$XL market cap is 1$ billion $RIDE Market cap is 2$ billion $WKHS market cap is $1.78 billion $NKLA market cap is $5.5 billion $FSR market cap is $4.69 billion $HYLN market cap is $1.87 billion $CCIV market cap is $6 billion $GOEV market cap is $2.12 billion"
Going parabolic soon... Shorts are toasted..
So awesome I just started to buy into this
This one trick pony only knows how to sit.
"Without massive subsidies, the economics of hydrogen most likely would not work within the next 5 years. However, where are those massive subsidies going to come from, with federal and state governments all in massive budget deficit. Further, most of the current hydrogen is coming from dirty power sources, not from surplus clean energy, very costly and inefficient. I don't see companies such as $PLUG, $FCEL, $BLDP, $BM, $NKLA, etc, would do awesome financially going forward within the next 5 years.Any real experts out there have very valid and well thought out opposing perspective ? I would love to read how green hydrogen can save the world and profit hydrogen companies at the same time."
In for more at 12.12. Buying calls if it dips below 12. Tsla dragging us.
When you see the stock price is the same as day 1 of trading
I am surprised IBD is pumping this stock
"more juicy returns... thanks, nkla! and thank you shorts who still haven't covered! :)"
New CNBC mention didn’t phelp
"NKLA is too low to sell. Hopefully, WSB comes to help us to squeeze those shorts to moon."
"As I mentioned yesterday, the pattern is almost identical to April/May of 2020, rising and doubling by June..and yet some brain surgeons still sitting on their corpulent hiney and predict doom!"
Shorts will have to cover! We may hit $15 soon
This is good for hexagon. Means nothing for nkla
$ride is better than $nkla. Soon it is going to cross $15. Hold on.

Tomorrow 9.50 and next week 3.25
Nikola hopes to have Nikola Tre in production in about 3 months. Here is the rub. Nobody has placed an order for the Nikola Tre. Not a single order. Not one. Let that sink in.
Welcome to cover town....
"Remember all that we know about this company. Do not get emotional, do not get married to an equity. This is business. NKLA is trash. And if you were an early investor before all the information on fraud came out join one of the class action lawsuits (which there are many) and write the SEC and DOJ to speed up the investigations they have going, and write to your local and state representative so you can get something back at least. You worked hard for that money, do not let NKLA steal it from you. They have a responsibility to you as investors which is called ""fiduciary trust"" and they did not honor it."
I looked at the stock history from the beginning of covid. Seems like a big scam happened. There has to be many bag holders. Sad!
He gave us hope and we bought! Now he sold his shares and gave up his hope! I wondered who bought!

Bought more puts $5 strike price for June 18
"April 30th is the last day of the share lockup. After this date, millions of Nikola shares get unlocked for selling. Nikola stock will continue its downward trajectory as people who can sell, will want to get out before that fateful date arrives."
I have a start of a buy in at 12 . It may go to 8 and who knows may just loose it all ? Oh boy what to due
SO many people here are trying to be funny... I BET none of them has shorted the stock since they know that any big contract will cause the share price to double or triple. I also don't recommend they quit their minimum wage job and become comedians as they are not funny
"In general don't allow the money you worked very hard for, really stressed out over, and are hoping to use some day for yourself (Which you deserve) to be used up by some people coasting off your life. Trevor and his family/friends (NKLA) have already got the cars, the dream homes, the boats off of your hard work. Don't allow them to take more from you."
What a Ponzi scheme
"SEC has appointed George Potter, to bring criminal chargesagainst certain founders of NKLA. As posted by Matthew Lohr."
"$NKLA The 7 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Nikola Corporation have a median target of 20.00, with a high estimate of 30.00 and a low estimate of 13.00. The median estimate represents a +99.60% increase from the last price of 10.02."
I have 900 shares at $16. Bleeding  red
"Help is on the way. I heard a rumor that Nikola was hiring a firm for some more photoshopped images. These are brand new, never before seen. That's gotta be worth $5 a share?"

Tomorrow going to $10.15
"Hello Yahoo Community!We have all learned in the last few months how difficult it is to trade successfully in the current market conditions. Especially for people who are just at the beginning of their trading career, it is difficult to find their way around the stock market and still be profitable. A few months ago I almost had to give up my trading career because of heavy losses. But then, luckily, I became aware of PREMARKET GAPPERS (https://premarketgappers.com/). This is a highly professional tool that analyzes stock market events and draws attention to current runners. This enables entry before the crowd, which makes good profits possible. The tool is constantly adapted to market developments and is supported and improved by a very committed team. In addition, at Premarketgappers there are some long-standing traders and hedge fund managers available to help you with advice and action. If you are interested, just contact me and I will see that you get a very good offer."
"a wise man once said ""buy when others are fearful"". Granted NKLA have had their share of problems. Milton being one. The factory is underway. they are still looking in relatively good shape to have production underway by year end.you have to bear in mind initially this was a ""speculative"" play. No wonder it was shorted to oblivion.hydrogen vehicles will be the future especially in haulage circles since the environmental impact and also cost is far more favourable to lithium.in the UK we are slowly switching to LNG for our heavy goods vehicles. Hydrogen will follow.The market corrected and this is now what I deem to be a fair price, but, it is definitely a long term hold. Year end will tell. There will always be shorts on boards like this. there will always be haters.The longevity and potential of what could be achieved far outweighs the short term fluctuations in price imo."
only 50 to go lol
with such a blood red market today NKLA is green this is quite impressive so probably people don't want to sell this stock.
"The story of how hydrogen fuel cell technology is powering the nation, ""Powering the Nation - Hydrogen Fuel Cells - the Clean Transportation Alternative,"" will have its first airing simulcast Friday, March 26, at 7 p.m. EDT on Science Channel and MotorTrend TV.

"Question. I believe hydrogen fuel-cell technology has its market. Especially commercial vehicles where energy/weight is very important. But there are mature hydrogen fuel-cell companies that deliver the fuel-cells like Ballard power, and commercial hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles like Hyundai Xcient Truck. What makes Nikola unique or better than others? I only read negative news about Nikola."

Breaking news: Nikola testing heavy load carriers. Spy footage leaked from Trevor testing in the Bahamas:
NKLA second model Badger more green
Just some things of NKLA: The company is packed with people with no experience or expertise in the field they are supposedly developing. Founders brother was put in a high position in the hydrogen development area despite laying concrete and doing basic home repairs his whole life. Don't fund someone elses vacations and dream homes while your money gets literally burnt. You are worth more then that.
"I love share buy backs, dividend, capital gains and huge profits in earnings releases. Therefore I love many stocks, but NKLA is not one of them."

I can't understand why this is holding @10 during this market draw down... I am almost ready to buy this because it should be less than a dollar. something going on here

lol @ fake crash.
Stock goes up over 4% for a 100 vehicle order RUMOR. Lol you poor people invested in this company (who’s been failing for since before Trevor left) must love losing money. So many other EV options and yet you are sticking it out with this one
Hey Trevor man up pay a fine and comeback and lead this company to greatness.don’t be scared
"20dma will turn up tomorrow as 20 days ago drop out. Systems programmed for this will buy - how many, who knows. Just a technical fact.Company fundamentals have taken very positive turn."
"Still overvalued, <5 and I’m in."

"Even though nearly 40 percent of American adults have received the COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 cases across the country have been skyrocketing in the past month. The surge in cases has cast a dark pallor over the positive news on vaccinations, suggesting that a great number of Americans have prematurely cast caution to the wind. Yet it seems that the vaccinations may finally be catching up to the virus. Newly updated data from this week shows that coronavirus cases are not increasing linearly or exponentially, as they have in previous surges. Experts believe the COVID-19 case load in the country is following the downward curvature that signifies we've hit an inflection point — giving public health officials and experts alike hope that the worst of the pandemic is truly over.In a Tuesday briefing, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Rochelle Walenski noted that over the past seven days, new cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths all went down. Specifically, new infections fell by 21 percent over the past week, prompting Walensky to call the trend ""a really hopeful decline."" Even cases in states like Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota— which were leading the surge in the U.S. last week — are down.""I hope this message is encouraging for you,"" Walensky said. ""It shows just how powerful these vaccines are in our efforts to end this pandemic and why we are asking everyone to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated.""Walensky's tone was starkly different from a separate press briefing a few weeks ago, in which she warned of ""impending doom.""The sudden downward trend has many wondering if the U.S. has reached a turning point where enough of the population is vaccinated to slow down the rate of transmission. If that's the case, that means that as more people get vaccinated, the decline may be slow and steady.""I keep on thinking of this picture on getting to herd immunity,"" Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California–San Francisco, told Salon. ""These sheep turn pink every time they're vaccinated, and there are fewer and fewer white sheep that are unvaccinated next to each other, and then the virus can't spread because it can't spread among the pink sheep.""Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist.Gandhi said she suspects this is what happened in Israel, which she looks to as an example of how mass vaccination can end the pandemic. Indeed, last week, Israel recorded zero new daily COVID-19 deaths for the first time in 10 months. About 54% of the Israeli population is now fully vaccinated, and the rate of positive virus tests has dropped to 0.2%, according to the Times of Israel; meanwhile, the virus regeneration number, which indicates how many more people are infected for each infected person, has dropped to 0.75 — meaning the virus will eventually go extinct if trends continue. Yet it wasn't easy to reach this point. In January, COVID-19 cases in Israel surged, despite one-fifth of the country's population being vaccinated. That prompted a renewed lockdown. Amid the surge, the country opened vaccination eligibility to everyone over 16 at the beginning of February. Over the next month, cases fell low enough for the country to reopen on March 7. To date, people in Israel continue to gather freely, and for the first time cases aren't rising despite an ease in restrictions. Israel's example reveals that vaccinating the majority of the population is key to ending the pandemic.Gandhi hopes that Israel's experience foreshadows what will come in the United States. She noted that cases in Israel started to fall when 40 percent of the population received at least the first dose of the vaccine, and says that the same trend is occurring in the United States. However, she cautioned there are some caveats — like a population's herd immunity — that could affect at what percentage of vaccinations does a country reach its inflection point.""The nuance is that every place has a different level of natural immunity based on their surges,"" Gandhi said. ""And so if you have natural immunity in your population, then you likely reach that inflection point sooner.""According to the CDC vaccine tracker, at least 42.7% of the U.S. population has now received the first dose of a vaccine; 29.1 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.""And then what's the next number that makes it so you almost get rid of it?"" Gandhi asked. ""I don't know what that is, but my estimation is somewhere between 65 and 70 percent.""Over the last year, cases have risen and fallen; the United States has struggled to reach a point of steady decline. Gandhi said this time is different because the fall in COVID-19 cases runs parallel to the increase in vaccinations; credit is also owed to the effectiveness of the vaccines.""Tbio is confirmed next Moderna, 35 point pop"

"— Saying “Wait, but the “Analysts“ are *saying it’s worth more” is inherently flawed in this case -as it requires of you to make the following ￼assumption￼: ￼“I can trust that this “company“ will do (with me) differently now than they allegedly did in the past.” There’s your “flaw“. ￼And said flaw could be made manifest by way of “Secondary offering“."

I got banned for supporting NKLA on Reddit yesterday. Seems Reddit is run by shorts.
NKLA exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
nkla at $10 and hyln at $8. what a time to invest 
Can anyone why you’d choose this over Hyliion?

"The moment I was made aware that this was a company willing to roll a truck down a hill and pretend it was working, I dumped everything and moved on.Seems like a wise decision. Company with 0 morals."

Whoever bought NKLA at 50 now understands bubbles. Congrats! Hope it didn't cost too much for the lesson.
"Hi, Burger brothers. I am an investor living in Korea. I have 2,000 shares for 15.9 dollars. If you hang in there, it'll be a good day for us. Tesla was only five dollars in 2010. But after 10 years, they achieved 900 dollars. At that time, there was high uncertainty and risk about electric cars, so investors didn't buy much. I think the current hydrogen infrastructure and hydrogen car are the same as the electric car of that time. Nicola will make us rich in 5 to 10 years."
"After all.. Listening to all these bashers,we are not in a bad position, I Just feel bad for the ones that got in at 90 SP... But we will definitely triple from this point on"

"The hydrogen dilemmaHydrogen trucks will offer zero emissions and expected to provide a range nearer to the Hypertruck’s, though practically that entire infrastructure network is currently nonexistent. A functional hydrogen truck fueling network needs about 500 to 700 stations"
"People who held that stock after Trevor and his brother got caught fleecing the company are just plain old ignorant. This was a scam company from the start and analyst played the bad news down so that they could exit the stock. This was mentioned in this group numerous times and those who listened probably walked away with a small loss; like myself. You want sold EV stocks, then look at Tesla, Nio and Xpev."
keep knockin down the share price. Ready to buy another 1400 shares. I just laugh and laugh and laugh at the shorts
"Hey, Mr. Shorts Boo Boo Boo hahahahaha"
NO NO .. please dont drop !! I love you CEO !!

"If you think Nikola is a worthwhile company to invest in, you should immediately get out of the market and let someone else manage your money. You are a danger to yourself."
"Don't panic. Stay cool, just sell."

Can’t believe there are still people out there not knowing this company is a scam. That’s when you know the market is full of newbies trying to make a quick buck after 2min of research.
5.00 next week in toute
hows everyone feeling here today?
"Wedbush made a great call by upgrading Nikola. If Nikola got credit for all the good things they're accomplishing, shares would be $100/sh. Nikola cancelled some really awful money-losing deals with GM & Republic Svcs. Nikola also cancelled the Badger pickup. Nikola has replaced Trevor Milton w/ more competent officers and Board Members. Nikola successfully signed a deal with the water company to supply its plant in Coolidge, AZ with water. Nikola entered a hugely successful partnership to buy electric from Arizona Public Service Company. NIkola has partnered with RIG360 for Class 8 sales and service. Nikola is partnering with TravelCenters for hydrogen stations. Per JP Morgan, Nikola will soon have a vehicle that can be road-tested. And now Wedbush upgrading the stock. These accomplishments easily justify a $100/sh price for Nikola."
I'm buying more

Red market not a big problem but the big problem even market go green companies still down
Milton sold all his shares. Do you think this stock is heading for BK?I don't see it as a positive news.
"Like I said last week, NKLA will trend downward below $10 soon and it is still going down because the assumption about it’s business and revenue at time of SPAC no longer exists."
Imagine if this hits 17
"After two days, some news that find a cat die inside the factory of NKLA and short sellers drop the price. hahaha"
Why has it been rising all these days without any specific news?
"IM NOT SELLING TOO ! 10 folds return or nothing, all in. LONG AND STRONG !"
Most heavily shorted EV stock but still can not get it under SPAC price === conclusion maybe allegations are not correct?
"So, I read a while back that NKLA had fudged the video of their prototype 18 wheeler (Citron), and that it was actually going DOWNHILL for the entirety.So, I go to profile to access the company website, and I see videos of Nikola trucks going UP inclines at their test rack doing around 70 mph? Who should I believe here: the shorts (at over 60 million shares), or the company that shows their prototype quietly displacing the EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE DESTROYING effects of diesel as the only means of overland trade transportation other than trains? Billions in market cap evaluation pales when near trillion $$ in market cap has already been breached in this sector. FACT: once breathable air is gone, it's OVER for us - dead stop, as a species, so if NKLA really has the goods on an 18 wheeler that will send diesels to the junkyard, its valuation/market cap is an UNDER valuation, IMHO. On the other hand. If the videos of their prototype truck performing flawlessly are all bulls**t, well. that's just downright fraud."
"I am in it now for sure, not selling until $50s anyone with me?"
i love this company
"Why does a company that (according to their 10K) has 1B USD in cash need to dilute their shares at a very low price to only raise $100M ?Does anyone has a flag, red please and BIG."
Can you say short squeeze to 18
Shorts margin called ?
tomorrow will be good
NKLA stock is rising on all of the amazing product news coming out.
"Ooh look at $ALYI go, it's on its way back up to ??? that news is awesome. If their investment goes boom with Zoomcar, ALYI could see $1.00 sooner than June. They are basically pulling a $TSLA. Good for them. $NKLA and $XPEV investors as well as $NIO and $TSLA investors are scrambling to get in now."
"NKLA climbing last few days on no news. Lock up ends Friday. No pumping here, move along"
#$%$ company goes up .20c today then back down $1.00 the next
Short Squeeeeeze!
Don’t forget what happens in the last hour.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, and fellow investors in Nikola, you are looking at a stock that is truly a piece of chitte."
bought 2 k today
What is the 200 dma ? I can’t find
"Nkla lost 0.16 vs lost 0.26? Questions to all investors are,What has it produce?What has it sold?Everyone assumed that Nkla has made profit, but that is no the case here Nkla is just had less head count that is why it spend less than last quarter."
"Wow, so strong on a day like this when a lot of stocks are in minus. If you had believed the people who wrote in the forum yesterday we would be at $ 5 today. Shortis, go home .."

"When you start having people pretend the reason NKLA is going down is because of shorts you start to realize that these guys are in a cult like thinking mode. This isn't ""investing"" anymore. It's not even business for them. They are so new that they have emotions and pride and identity all caught up in this. It is sad too because they could just move on and make some great money with some actual great companies in one of the best markets we have ever seen and instead they are shakling themselves to a dumpster fire that is a literal meme in business and across the world for fraud and deception.. It's just sad at this point."
Go Nikola Go............Hydrogen is the future..........
"This stock should be halted. Trevor Milton and his associates should be in jail, and everything they own sold to repay investors some portion of their losses. Sue the board members and GM too."

People are still in this stock??
Don’t open a position in NKLA until you hear what (http://newlife-stockalerts.tech) has to say about it. These guys give amazing insights like no other service.
"If Nikola was such a fraud, why wouldn't the SEC or DOJ have stepped in by now? As proven by Nikola's investigation, allegations against NKLA are largely fictitous and exaggerated. Short sellers trying to get us to sell. Trevor Milton is selling shares b/c he has so many and has mounting legal bills. People can can reform themselves. I don't care about Nikola's CEO's checkered past. The past is the past. I do care that NKLA has all the cutting edge tech to beat Tesla. GM is still partnering with NKLA for Nikola's cutting edge tech. I see Nikola's share price going up. My advice is to average down and buy more shares."
"You mean to tell me only .10 pop on the massive infrastructure bill that will impact the whole EV market , that includes semi trucks"

Once this implosion stops, should start to reverse. Reminds me of Tesla not too long ago."
Get on-board immediately before you get crushed to $30 by NKLA in a couple of days!!!!
Anyone still wants NKLA to be like TSLA?
"Remember: Hindenburg's conclusion: Nikola doesn't have the technology, some pre-orders are made and the company is a fraud in general. Nikola still owes investors proof to the contrary. This is also the case with Lordstown ..."

I can see this board has been infested with maggot shorts who can’t post anything of substance to back up their slander to push down the stock.Question for anyone serious about investing (regardless if you are bullish or bearish)....Two days ago NKLA release a press release regarding their upcoming quarterly conference call with a Friday after the bell time. Then today changes the time to 9:30am. Interested in hearing people’s thoughts on why this happened.
"With all the terrible, atrocious policies that have been put in place by the socialist administration, all the lies, smoke and mirrors, the reality of the repercussions are taking hold.

"get those calls, boys..."
$15 next week. $20 June. $35 July. ... ... ...
Just in case you don’t know. Nikola has dropped to $11. What a scam.
"Does it concern any investors that the owners/founders of all these startup companies are able to cash out and be filthy rich before the company has any sales or revenue?(I’m underwater on one such company)If the money isn’t coming from company profit it is coming from the investors.Put aside your enthusiasm for a company and look at it logically.Investors have lost millions/billions but the management has made millions/billions and still nothing has been produced ???Anyways it’s your money, spend it however your hearts desire."
In a short squeeze valuation is meaningless. Infinity is the potential target value.
Keeping my 75 shares long . Worth the gamble . Still believe in this company
Not sure a letter of intent to buy 100 trucks in 2022 is going to do a whole lot for the stock price.
I think it’s almost time to start investing in these Big Rigs 
Holding your stock here because you are attached to it is a MISTAKE
I’m selling all ahead and will repurchase at 5.
Easy next week 20
— $10.71 -I’m waiting. I shouldn’t but I am...
The fact that I am seeing a lot of people post not knowing about all the fraud and lies and drama with the founder from almost 6 months back worries me. Do you guys not look into the companies you invest in at all? Or in the case of NKLA light your fire in a dumpster rather than invest? At this point you are just being lazy and a fool investing in companies like this.
Those people trashing Nikola will also be buying Nikola

Hi NKLA longs. You noticed that the rest of the market (with real companies producing real things instead of renderings and phantasies) is up big time. Unfortunately and expected NKLA is not.Sell and make some money in real companies.

Thank you all for your negative post about NKLA. What do you stand to gain for your all your negative comments other than your ulterior motive? Guys be wise and don't be deceived. A word is enough for the wise.

"Wow, you don't see crapola like this often. It's like a red river."
"After 6 long months and literally maybe a hundred or more of posts trying to educate people on how fundamentals and mania would wear off it has returned to IPO price. The reality now is that within a year or so this will be bankrupt or delisted from the market entirely. Now that we know all the fraud and there is no hints of anything real all the value that was speculated at the launch of the SPAC is no longer there. People think this is the low but hear it from me the guy that has been on here since the height telling you to get out. This is going bankrupt. Take whatever money you can get out now. Join the class action lawsuits because what happened here was fraud and a violation of the fiduciary trust. Write the SEC and DOJ and get them to continue hard on their investigations so maybe some of these fraudsters can be held accountable and assets seized. Write your local and state representatives. You would be surprised how powerful these actions can be and you can get some of your money back. For those that want to invest in hydrogen I applaud you but guys don't get emotional, this is business and investing. You can pick actual good companies pursuing these technologies. Not companies that hire their friends and family with no experience or expertise. For goodness sakes they had a brother who did basic home repairs and laying concrete his whole life leading up the hydrogen development team... Your money was used to buy houses and cars for other people. Money you worked hard for. That isn't right."
Let's finish under $12!
why buy this when you can get rich of Tesla
Interesting post about the Nikola US factory on page 175 of the DDC Journal on P175https://www.ddcjournal.com/issues/spring2021/
"If you're a long, please read this. I used to be an investor late last year but just became disengaged after the short report. As someone who has no stake in NKLA and doesn't care if they go up or down, please think rationally. Look at their month chart. If you buy or hold, you are by definition catching the falling knives. A mistake I see a lot with investors is they sell their winner too early and hold their losers too long. This is a loser, and don't hold even if you're down 60%. I do have sympathy for you longs, but the best thing you can do right now is sell, take a step back, learn, and move forward. It's not the end of the world. Best of luck to you."
this stock will bounce to $13.9
Nikola could double without warning!!!
Id wait for pps to settle around 6 even before considering buying.
When it drops to 10 I'm buying!
Anybody remember Trevor Milton lololol
"33% year interest to borrow shares to short, 250000 shares available. A nice way to avoid those shares to be borrowed is to place a sell order at a significantly high price as 100$/shares. You can readjust it later ;) Then the broker won't be able to give your shares in the hands of shorts sellers since they must be available to be sold by you the share holder. So your shares will be locked for the period of time determined by the duration of the sell offer."
Wheee. We lost less $ than expected.
Close ur eyes and buy buy buy
Goodland please tell me u guys are not holding on to this #$%$ just because it almost did but didn't and will never.... get out......
What are the odds this trades at $400 a share in 5 years?
No big sell off at opening. I was wrong
LETS GET THROUGH $12 threshold and then its skies the limit!
They should give up on BEV. No batteries and weight of vehicle will not get the brewery contract that they keep bragging about. Reduce their cash burn until if/when they get a hydrogen vehicle.
Time load up on Nikola. Badger technology is the future.
Any Trevor fans here ? lol
$NKLA is worth 3x more than $RIDE. LOL
Could this be the next Tesla?

"Nikola is undervalued at this price, as soon as the EVs pick up speed we shall see this rise"

Hyln signing contracts and you baggies still sitting here waiting when theyCan’t even fill hydrogen trucks for at least 5-10 more years why??
THIS #$%$ IS UP????? EVEN KODK IS UP. EVEN RAD IS UP. Anything is possible in this market.
When the first IVECO truck will be delivered in Ulm (DE) with Nikola badge we can start the discussion.
I remember the day well when NKLA plummeted. It nearly hit or did hit $100 in the pre market that day. It plummeted towards $60 within days and I sold at $72. Trevor Milton should be jailed for what he did.
$9 a week ago. Would still be $9 if Robinhooders would WAIT and not try psychic tactics. Enjoy.
Can anyone share what change in market is driving the upward shift now?
"It is clear the news flow and company timeline has changed the perception of NKLA.They will be first to market with BEV which is proving to in demand.Once BEV is perfected, the FCEV will follow using the same drive train and reduced battery.The other upstart EV's like FSR are not seeking a broad enough market.My picks for companies in production are: RIDE, NKLA and WKHS."
the chart is very closely following tesla's right now.
"Good Morning longs! Keep your heads up and look at the long term prospects. Until someone else enters the hydrogen fuel heavy trucks niche, you have nothing to fear. It’s real and will pay off as we enter the fourth quarter and beyond!!! Hang in there"
Breaking News: Guy misses out on x3 because he is still hung up about previous actions of guy who no longer runs the company.
NKLA could easily set a new 52 week high today. The news coming out is incredible.
$SPCE $5 billion - 0 flights; $NKLA $5 billion - 0 cars; $TSLA $565 billion - 0 operating profit; $BTC-USD $775 billion - 0 use

Curious how this holds up.
"@Wayne your response to @Peter below is not accurate. While Hyliion is not building the underlying “semi truck”, their approach negates the need to build a massive factory with assembly engineering staff at incredible costs (like both NKLA and TSLA). Rather, Hyliion is enabling fleets to purchase whatever major OEM semi truck they want - while reducing their emissions to net negative and delivering on the lowest 7-year TCO measurement in the Class 8 EV trucking space. Hyliion can also travel further, carry a larger load, is far greener and costs dramatically less to operate vs a NKLA Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicle. While there is a market for short haul EVs and FCV, NKLA cannot hope for more than that and neither should you. Prove me wrong "
NKLA has no chance against Tesla - Tesla has the money and resources. NKLA has nothing - no jobs and no inventory to even sell. Why do you think every company backed out. Management skimming.
Up up up
And here we’re red again 
$9 before market closes lets gooo
Don’t panic. Factory will complete and start assembling trucks. Look video from manufacturing director (nikola): he said cabins coming from Germany and assembled in Arizona this summer already. As far as Trevor- he owns 91 mln shares. He sold 0.5% of his shares

"Not looking real good for Nikola. After its owner turned out to be a ""coasting"" truck manufacturer, and after he got rich off of smoke and mirrors and managed to get GM to waste their money in the projects, the non producing truck company is seeking its real value. It is down now about 90% from its highs. That isn't a good sign."
Better invest into $NKLA which is more shorted than CLOV
"What difference does it matter if the head of fuel cell development leaves? Last I checked, Iveco and others are providing Nikola with BEV and hydrogen-powered trucks. Nikola doesn't need the dead weight of employees who add no value. Good riddance is all I have to say. And shares will rebound as the market sees what Nikola has to offer."
This will be 20 eom
"$NKLA who is a preproduction company like us is valued at 4.7B, FSR was probably a better company before this news but NOW without a doubt has a way way brighter future. If we just match that valuation puts us at $16 tomorrow, Eaaassssssy money"
"Nikola is and always was a stock scam. Nothing more. They have produced exactly zero sellable products in their 7-year history. Nikola Tre, an Iveco truck with Nikola stickers, has zero customer orders."
"RKFL Cryptocurrency app allowing payment of goods and services globally by using your Cryptocurrency. Good news is, only 24 million shares outstanding. Get in while it is still under $3.00"

"""The founder of the embattled electric truck start-up Nikola has sold $49m worth of shares in the company, a transaction that posted late on the Friday evening of a holiday weekend. Trevor Milton, who stepped down as executive chair seven months ago in the wake of a short seller’s report and online accusations, sold 3.5m Nikola shares on Wednesday at the closing price of $13.89. The transaction appeared on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website two days later after business hours, suggesting a wish to avoid publicising the sale."""

This company has no other choice but to issue more and more stock to raise ever more money because they are YEARS off from mass production. And even IF they reach mass production - there’s NO WHERE for fleets to fill up the Hydrogen gas tank!

"show me your averages, I want to laugh."
"according to Paul Williamsen, Lexus’s manager of global strategic communications:If EVs were the answer to our oil and smog problems, Lexus would be producing whisper-quiet luxury electric cars, but it’s not. According to Williamsen, the Japanese company, and its giant parent, Toyota, believes that “both hybrid and EVs are merely bridging technologies on the way to the solution, which is hydrogen”.Unlike EV-mad Nissan, the Toyota group’s plan is to largely stick with internal-combustion engines and hybrids, because a “smart company” wouldn’t bother investing too much money in a form of propulsion that will never catch on, and will soon be redundant anyway. This explains, in part, why Toyota is partnering up for its ""bridging"" EVs rather than throwing all of its own considerable resources at the technology."
Nikola FOMO investors:
Great company. Zero revenue. Fraud CEO. Zero prospects. The DodgeCoin of EV.

$7.50. Look at all my posts related to Nikola over the past 2 months! I said we would enter the $10 range. I promise we’ll enter the $7 range once the $10 threshold is broken! Too many put options for this not to happen!We go down...May even hit $5

So Trevor sold about $100 million in nkla stock last week? He obviously doesn't believe in the company and is admitting that this was a complete fraud from the beginning.
"$10 is bottom , it will go up from here."
Nikola is a stock scam. Nothing more. They have not produced a single sellable product in their 7-year history. They are under criminal investigations by multiple federal agencies. Nikola is the 5th fraudulent company started by founder Trevor Milton... Need I go on?Anybody holding Nikola at this stage richly deserves everything that is coming to them.

"A blow under the belt for sellers and missing sellers. In recent months there have been all sorts of prophets of the apocalypse in which they foretold the destruction of the company and eventually proved to be false prophets.

it was a big mistake not to buy it for $9.80 yesterday.

"Wedbush is right with Nikola. Why does the management postpone the launche of the Tre FCEV to H2 2023, thats two years later than the launch of the Tre Bev. And my two cents about the design change of the FCEVs: the design doent look like its representing the new age of hydrogen, but rather the FCEVs look like grey mice. Why is that that Nikola has lost its phenomenal design?"

All in.... this one has great news coming. You heard it here first. DO NOT ASK ME do your own DD.
Nikola is trying to pump the stock in hopes to do another secondary. Lawyer fees are getting expensive.
Trading used to be such a frustrating experience for me. The losses mounted up until I discovered the winning service over at (http://Multistockalerts.com) check them out today.

"Yahoo decided to parse this article from their aggregator, but don’t worry I have your backs!Nikola looking to raise 100 million for next stock offering.March 16, 2021 12:16 am by Claire Bushey in ChicagoNikola, an electric vehicle start-up plagued by legal troubles, plans to sell up to $100m in stock to investors.The Arizona-based company said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it would attempt to raise capital for general corporate purposes, including building a factory in suburban Phoenix, developing commercial scale for battery and fuel cell-powered semi-trucks, and advancing hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.Many electric vehicle players were currently trying to raise capital to tackle an estimated $5tn market for EVs over the next decade, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. Investors are hungry to fund these companies, and scrutiny from federal law enforcement is unlikely to deter them if Nikola can deliver on its strategy.See you at $10 when this day comes!"
—$10.88 today?
"Faked out the market, thought about selling last week at $10. "
Might as well invest in Iveco then.
"Just added another 1500 shares, great bargain"

Ford has no chance..will be bankrupted with Unions payments and another government bailout coming4. NIO has no factory, burning cash and will be bankrupted without 200 times of dilution meaning bankrupted too. Zero chance of getting into EU or America. Currently the World hates China for the lies with the VIRUS. Same goes for Xpev and Lie Auto5. VW CEO is cookoo. Total nutjob soon to be bankrupted6.

OK -- Among the things that I have done was a 15+ year stint in Human Resources. The idea of giving someone compensation now to encourage better business performance later makes as much sense as feeding an eating contest contestant a huge meal just before the contest starts.Who in the world thinks that this will drive the hunger needed to make a successful business? Mindboggling!
today +20%
i jus said 1 week ago to sell when this was above $12. look what happened now. Feel bad for you guys. IMO this will go to $8 soon. Sell it now.
"Nikola is easily worth 6$ with all their tech/promises/fudgeries.Where the other almost 10$ Comes from, that I have no idea. Must be from pretty photoshop of fake truck."
Today will be much better

welcome to the party HOLD IS THE THEME.
Down it goes
Trevor is probably selling off shares 
The way I interpret this news is that Nikola is so incompetent that they are unable to develop the hydrogen technology in house and are outsourcing its development. This further underscores how they have no product with anything proprietary.This agreement is literally hexagon agreeing to SELL its hydrogen product to Nikola nothing more.
"The reason for the recent price fall is because of big time shorting not sell off. Once shorting becomes more difficult as shares are more difficult to borrow, this “sell off” will end and shorts will get burned. Look at GME"
"When you are so desperate for a ""company"" to go up that you try and mislead people and or pump a stock on yahoo finance that is your sign to just sell and move on. There are some really wonderful companies out there. This is business not emotion. There are so many places to make great money in the markets right now. I also recommend researching going forward and learning about fundamentals and in general common business sense. Don't just throw your moneys at gambles and if you are going to do that method or do highly speculative picks at least research if the ownership has a history of fraud and investor lawsuits. NKLA is a literal meme on the internet of a joke. This isn't an opinion, this is an actual thing. Other people that do purely gamble and speculative picks use NKLA to make fun of. That should be something you'd want to understand the ""Why"" of instead of putting your hard earned money into a company so terrible."
$120 end of year
Maybe i am crazy but can somebody explain why nikola frankfurt is red and nasdaq green?
$15 NEXT WEEK.
This is finally starting to head back in the right direction. I have been waiting for something that feels forever. Let's go. I'm average $20
Why would you invest in a company that has nothing instead of investing in a company that has something already? nkla ideals and wannabe products is already out there. they have nothing to offer.
"It seems that investors are not using their minds to invest, i don't even get how $NKLA stock is worth almost 4 dollars more than this amazing last mile delivery company, it doesn't make any sense. I think that Workhorse's infrastructure is great and it will be dominating the league in a couple of years if people start using their minds"
May be $25 next week
. MAJOR NEWS. Bloomberg Analysts State Fisker FSR could be a TEN X Tesla Type performer in the next 30 -90!days it will double from its $12 price currently
There's a YouTube on the HYLN board that is a MUST WATCH
This stock is the future of heavy trucks in 2023 you will be very rich
NKLA will be bankrupt soon; no income coming in - just loosing money out the door. Poor management.
"this reminds me of the bre-x scandle. the owner sold only 2 % of his holding, taking 100 million cold cash off the table, and then claimed I am still holding 98% and I am with you."
We have Gravity Drive failure!
"$ 850 million in cash, 900km range technology and a factory under construction ... Why would the company be so bad?"
unlocked
If you were in NKLA before all the information of fraud and cronyism came out I recommend joining some of the countless class action lawsuits. I also recommend writing the SEC and DOJ and telling them to speed up on their investigations. I also recommend contacting your local and state representatives. You were mislead and that is illegal. I honestly wish a lot of you the best.

This will go to 85 when they start manufacturing their trucks in their Arizona plant this fall! Enjoy the $
There's no doubt this is a highly speculative stock but when Travel Centers of America gets the hydrogen refueling stations up and running at the end of the year and with other deals in the works this will soar. Hydrogen fuel cells will play at large role in the transition to a low carbon future.
100$ to easy!!!
" everything getting smashed except Nikola. Go figure, just shows how completely unpredictable and irrational the markets are. Like Buffet said...I can’t tell you when you buy, just buy if you see something you like."
"NKLA DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE. JUST DOWN LIKE OTHER EV' S STOCK LIKE TESLA,NIO,LI AND ....DOWN SIDE IS LIMITED MAXIMUM FEW MORE DOLLAR. BUT UPSIDE WILL BE HUGE. IT'S YOUR CHOICE NOW."
10000 at 11.04... to the moon
"Seriously, have your day shorts. But shorting isn’t investing. I’m holding long and strong, so let the shorters continue to accumulate, hopefully at 50% of shares outstanding or more. Then the short squeeze will begin as NKLA executes against its strategy of hydrogen fueled heavy trucks. Hold in there longs."
"Just remember that Amazon at one point was not profitable and dropped to $6/share. When fear is at its height, if there is no logical reason it’s the best time to buy. In my opinion this is an amazing opportunity to buy, hydrogen tech is ready to be implemented this decade."
going to be 30 dollar easy
You guys sell and I will buy with every penny i got
How could this trash be worth more then hyln you can’t even fill up a hydrogen truck on the road? Someone please explain. I would buy in but only see a bad future and a bankruptcy. Even if they put hydrogen stations in it will take forever and hydrogen is 3 times price of natural gas. I don’t see it.
Lol. I didn’t expect a 70% drop. Luckin had a massive scandal faking sales orders and had the same crash - 70%. Tells you about the future of this company.
"If you can sell for $13 tomorrow, don’t sell NIKOLA now."
"They are in partnership talk with GM and Ford in licensing the new truck engine which powers by Love and Affection, what a concept!!!"
Who knows why nikola was green all day long?
Before chasing and yoloing just stop and think for a minute... please.They're running this up so insiders can get out of dodge for lockup...
How'd you shorts like the morning fake out today? Book any losses?
20 soon
this is only the start. Infrastructure first then hardware! First 5 NKLA tre prototypes are in test. check out NKLA's roadmap (on their website and also shared during annual meeting). they are delivering on their promises. wait until their assembly factory is up and running in Q2 and when first firm orders come in. this will explode. Trevor is history. this company is for real. No BS and trucks rolling downhill. The 'new' NKLA is delivering on their promises.
"This company is a scam , wake up people￼"

"If $50, $40, $30 or $20 wasn't the bottom, maybe $13.75 could be the bottom. Maybe it's time to back up the truck!!!!"
"Of my $20K in lifetime savings, I invest $4000 in Nikola at $50, $4000 at $40 per share, $4000 at $30 per share, $4000 at $20 per share and $4000 at $10 per share. Am I smart??????"
More top Execs will be leaving in the coming weeks....
Does anyone see this ever trading at $1000 a share?
I am in buying mode of NKLA now

Just horrible with good news if bad news than will be $5
"I got out from 23.00 a share to 17.00, I knew this would go down, I dont know if it will dip below five, but take your losses and invest in dogecoin to recoup ur losses asap!!!!"
"jj, tell us how much you lost on $GE, $SRRA and $NKLA so far? We'll wait."
Picking winning stocks is hard work when you don’t know what to do. I was losing big time until I found these guys (http://Fairstox.com). So glad I joined them.

"Lucky me short 3,000 shares @$12.40"
chart tells the sad story
amazone orderd today 15000 truck
"Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp., the troubled hydrogen-powered and battery-electric truck startup, lost a key member of its executive team with the departure of the former head of its fuel-cell development program.The company said Jesse Schneider, executive vice president of technology, hydrogen and fuel cells, left the company as of April 1. He had led its engineering teams working on fuel-cell systems, a planned hydrogen fueling station network and storage technology."
Stock really plain sucks.Trevor Milton is responsiblefor abortion called NKLA.
Short squeeze under way - 62 million short as of 4/30 - great eps presentation of production chartRIDE will be next.
"Guys, we are coupled to the Nasdaq and we can hope that Nasdaq will increase.."
COVER TIME...
You have to be pretty desperate at this point to think you are going to massively raise the price of NKLA using yahoo conversations Lol. The desperation here is bad. This is the sign to sell not further torment yourself with a company that literally has a history of fraud a mile long. No one in there right mind is ever going to do business with this organization. Would you?
Sneak peak of Nikola next innovative green machine.....
Not a bad day ... hopefully tomorrow will pick up 
Poor shorty bashers didn’t get the bad report they were hoping for and to boot a 100 truck order as a start. Have a miserable weekend bashers. Get a life
Next year it be $30.00
"Loveee it.Pump AndDumpHaha  I was thinking about jumping on board when this hit $14.00.Decided to wait.Then $13.00.. waitedThen $12.00Then $11.00Then realized this is going no where but down.Been on a 1 year downward spiral.Little pumps here or there, then down she goes.Don’t buy in on this. You WILL lose your money.The company does not make vehicles. They make no money. They lost their partnership deals. They committed fraud. If you invested $12.00+, use this pump, take your money and run forest!"
NEW ALL TIME LOWS THIS WEEK
gm is investigating heavy. All media talks diferent
I hope everyone sold yesterday
look at the balance sheet. at current burn rate ( over 300m/yr) they will have to either close it down or sell more shares within a year... most likely they'll fire everyone to push down burn rate and preserve the little cash they have and just become a small R&D firm that can trade on hopes of something bigger down the road and sell shares for years to come. sad but most likely outcome.
"Don’t trade NKLA on fundamentals, look at 2 yr chart. It’s completing second bottom, round trip, and is poised to rally on any positive news from the company. New factory in AZ, H2 infrastructure, testing new trucks by Iveco, all good, but not yet good enough. That’s the play, downside risk to 10 still possible, but the odds now favor 40-50 on news."
Energy partner for hydrogen to be announced soon.
"I am still holding $17,200 of this Company? Down almost 80%. Did Trevor settle all his legal troubles or what?"
Just sad
if you put share price on side for a moment..just think why they bother to post if they have no interest in share..if they are not holding why they bother to come here and waste their precious time..do you think they care about you hence warning you to sell your shares in cheap prices..no they dont..they just want to buy as cheap as possible ..create panic so others can sell and they can close their shorts..its common sense..
I put my life savings in this and $RMO and $NKLA . Retirement estimates 2 years ? glad I sold $TSLA $INO $NVAX $NIO

"Short interest is building to almost 30%. When this thing reverses, it will light up the shorts. You’ll see. Conversation is starting on Reddit to save her from the hedge fund dirt bags"
"Nikola flying to $20, buy while not late"
Unbelievable
I heard about NKLA the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"The market is missing the BEST EV plays...Not Plug or FCEL or TSLA.These American= RMO/ Canada= SOLO EV Car & LITHIUM BATTERY MAKERS1) SOLO- See Link, Insanely practical EV .. especiallyWithin Urban confines.

How low can it go? Can it go to the floor?
me reading all the comments on this NKLA board
I see a cup and handle formation setting up on the 1 month chart were due for a breakout based on the rsi and I’ve been running some similations with the potential daily simulations and the bollinger bands are squeezing together as long as we get volume tomorrow we should be primed for liftoff
"To all brain dead shorts spewing garbage: (1) NKLA is for real with real ideas and products - excellent design and engineering (2) all automakers and other big names use vendors to manufacture things, look no further than Apple that manufactures everything outside of the US by foreign manufacturers, including chips and processors (3) they have almost $1b in cash with no debt (4) they are laser focused on the Tre’s for Q4 2021 (5) nothing material came out of the Hildenberg report except"
Nikola the tide lifts all ships
Shorts time to close up
"The problem with ""get rich quicks stocks"", is that sometimes you ""get poor quick"""
I thought it would never go below $20.. then $15 seemed pretty bad and now most likely heading below $10 or less and theres absolutely no support from any institutional buyers.. this management team left thousand of individual investors on their own
i waiting to see it goes to zero.after dd this company is a joke only focus on pr where are the revenu where is the badger????great finally ivenco truck goes up the hill vs all movies goes down the hill
"Of all the ""companies"" to gamble on why would you pick NKLA? It is painful watching these guys try and defend this fraud dumpster fire. It right back to IPO price. The conversation is over. We all told you this would happen and it happened exactly how you denied for 6 months. The discussion is over...."
Freightliner just confirmed they are giving their class 8 truck market share to Nikola without a fight. Nikola to the moon.
My advice is don’t buy lmao :)
"so how does Monday look to everyone? Green, red?"
Nikola belongs at zero. They have nothing. No product. No future.
"Breaking News: NIKOLA in talks for hiring new strong Chief Downhill Roller, since the former chief is in training for the Olympics bobsled pushing."
"Guys don’t get excited, dead cat  bounce!! It is not going nowhere but down!! Too many unfulfilled promises !!!"
still doing better then hyln being years behide in any production capabilities
"GO BACK 5 MONTHS+ I SAID NKLA WAS ALL FRAUD. NO ONE SAW THE FACTORY. NO ONE CHECKED THIS COMPANY OUT. I SAID IT WAS SMOKE & MIRRORS & ALL FAKE. ZBEST CARPET CLEANERS HAD MORE GOING ON. THIS IS GOING TO $5.0 AS A CHEAP OPTION. BUY RIGL, THAT'S GOING TO DOUBLE DIGITS."
Huge positive news for this company and it still goes red. Wow
$100 soon
Bought 20K shares @10.77 today with a stop loss set @9.95. Wish me luck.
"Another option is to invest in EV suppliers. An increasing positive outlook on lithium’s future and the United States speaking out on securing it’s domestic supply of lithium has lead me to invest in Lithium Americas (LAC). Their Thacker Pass mine is the largest known lithium resource in America and recently got federal approval. LAC is seeking a partner rn and I believe Tesla will join them. Giga Nevada is only miles away. Their Argentina mine, Caucharí-Olaroz, is also only a year away from production."
whats the status of HYDROGEN truck? Nikola Trevor is only electric
NKLA just produces paper trucks. This company is going bankrupt soon.

Korean Hanwah sold 1/2 their Nikola holding and kept 1/2 what is wrong with this? Why media negatively cover this story? Oooo I see they scare you to sell. Let pull Nikola price down to $10 I am not going to sell
"Tesla actually has a truck, buy Tesla, Tesla has plans for planes, buy Tesla, Tesla has manufacturing, buy Tesla. Nikola has nothing but an idea and is using Instagram tactics to look the part."
Really falling now - it's a stampede for the exits! Get out! Get out!
See you at $50!!!
Today at $9.55
"I have no positions in NKLA, but I will soon. Lots of people shorting NKLA; the short interest now above 30%. I will not be surprise for a short squeeze soon."
buy order in at 13.15 to stay true to my dip-buying ways... doubt we get there though.
Going to OTC soon
Another attempt to pump the stock price higher before lockup and earnings. They are saving these announcements for when they need it the most. Con artists trying to get out at the best price possible lol.

Hyln to the moon today new installs new customers new batteries way undervalued!!
NKLA - A company that pushes trucks with no engines down hills to raise capital. There is a word for that.... It is Fraud. Join the countless class action lawsuits and write the SEC and DOJ and tell them to speed up their investigations. :)
I think that the pumpers will try to get it up to 15 today. Getting harder to find dumpees
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpQ0Cm5tBRU&ab_channel=NikolaMotorCompany
The weirdest thing about this company is that anyone would buy their stock.
Just curious why 90% of posts are just bashing nikola? There must be a reason behind this...hmmmmm
Performance bonuses lmao they didn’t perform anything fake phony fraud that’s why I switched to hyln no fake news real products real sales call it pump if you want but you’ll thank me later
next buy point is 9.50
Check out future options (Jan). This will fly in time.

It is okey market will recover soon and everything will go up  again
It is $11.11 and hope we see $20.11 soon
Just in short interest on NKLA increased drastically ... time for historic short squeeze !!!
WOW! Tripled my stake with those cheap juicy shares! Thanks shorts! Sell them at under $10 and buy back in short squeeze at $30 from me (JPM target)! You've forgotten GME short squeeze I guess! Wait for this one! LOL!
dont buy this stock. You will see more drop in the few months
Still no word on a battery supplier. Maybe Lion could make an extra battery each month to supply them
—Drop it to $9 so I can get more. Let’s do it!
"Oh baby, that's the one.Don't feel bad tomorrow if you soldYou can always get back in at $14 day open"
"In last January, NKLA was $28 and Trevor Milton who owns 91.6 million shares did not sell and last Friday he sold only 4m shares and he know that price will decline. Why he did not sell those shares last January by double of this price and why last Friday only sell 4m shares, why not 40m? There are many new big investors enter these days and all of this news to increase the sell volume. Note: Trevor Milton sold 4m shares at $13.89 and hold the other 87.6 millions to sell them when the price below $5 hahahahahah."

I don't know. Maybe I should back up the truck and buy massive amounts of this great company....lol."
"massive covering today, or later this week? market rebound is going to put pressure on these institutional shorts."
If the only thing the shorts have left in the bag that 'oooo they pushed a truck down a hill some years ago' because that's all I ever hear?!
"For those negative bashers out there, this is not a forum counselling￼￼. If you lost money from Nikola then you shouldn’t be investing your money into any stocks if all you people just complain. You all bashers need help not blogging negative stuff on these forums. This is not a counselling centre. ￼￼"

I heard this may hit $25 this week
"I was a long here once. I then realized that this is a scam, though i do respect the current CEO. The reputational damage is already significant, and the field is getting crowded. NKLA will also need to do an offering soon. It will go down, the only question is, how much more till it stabilizes. I see it around 5 in the next month or so."
Ohhhh this is like Xmas...

"I was at a TA center last month and got tipped off by the owner that Nikola is coming. Buying NKLA was a no-brainer, but as I saw the stock continue to fall, it was becoming clear that institutions were trying to shake out weak hands and load up themselves. I joined the buying. Hold for $75"
"Shares up nicely in pre-market for a reason. I don't know about cars and pickups. But in the semi-truck space, I think the clear winner is going to be Nikola (NKLA). Tesla has great lineup of battery cars. But in terms of hydrogen and battery electric semi-trucks, Nikola is in a league of its own. Nikola will soon be rolling out lineup of semi-trucks and building out a hydrogen fueling network. My money is on Nikola (NKLA)."

When you have to post on yahoo finance to try and mislead people hoping it will raise the stock price you live in a world of hurt and anger.  Sorry but not sorry William, you made your bed now you gotta go to bankruptcy with it  "
Apple using human teeth in their cell phones ? Sell this and buy $NKLa
"JP Morgan is being conservative with a $30 price target. Price target should be $300. Nikola finally has its act together. Under CEO Mark Russell, Nikola will soon have BEV and hydrogen-powered trucks for sale. When Nikola eventually announces a date to open a showroom and sell its first vehicle, all heck is going to break loose. Shares will skyrocket. Better to ignore all the naysayers and just buy shares now before share price goes up on the news."

Bad sign. Market is crushing and this #$%$ is getting slapped.
back to 20 soon !
"Been Trading a long time. when people buy - the price goes down. People are buying this up in droves right now. Forget what ""they"" tell you about investing."

i will buy at 50 cents a share....the true value
I am not selling it .
nikola is not gamestop
Money for lap dance  thanks NKLA
I still cant believe I buy this for 24USD and was stupid lucky enought sell it for 89USD. Worst stock of the year.
I still think we break $10 one more time before we ascend higher. Look at the charts and end of May puts! All Najarian has been talking about the last few weeks are the $7.50 puts in Nikola.
"Burn bb burn , till dust The best short ever"
i'm picking up a few more shares here.. i just have a sneaky feeling the market's going to jack itself up soon.
I just started following this dog. Hard to believe this dog traded in the ninth dollar range. I would be pizzed off. I trade on margin. I would of been wiped out. stock still has market value of over 5billion?
This stock is pretty hopeless people . I’d sell all right now. It’s just hopeless bat this point.
"Boy are the shorts happy ,they are hyped now. I’ll add in increments; so let’s do this ; I am buying every dip."
does this end red?
"Tell us about your $NKLA scam, jj."
When was this stock ever at $93.99 per share as per 52 week high and low ??
"Yes, I thank my God that I did not buy any of RIDE and $nkla shares...OMG. Can you imagine if you bought high and lost 90% of the worth???OUCH. NOt only ouch but painful crying ouch for years."
Nkla 5.4 billion cap no product no revenue no hydrogen stations nothing !! Hyln 1.8 billion cap retro fit axles and electric drivetrain being installed everyday over 700 fueling stations for Rng. Onboard 8 minute charging. ERX IS REAL and has PAID preorders from agility and possibly wegmans and will be released within 6 months ..... you tell me why I should buy nkla I have way more faith in hyln just my opinion good luck guys.
NNOX is up going thru short squeeze. $FB $SHOP $SNAP $NKLA
"@stevie, u ARE blind. Have someone interpret the production chart they published.Then go elsewhere to publish your negative dibble. Hope you have text-to-speech."
$3 stock at most.....and that’s being generous.
"I have £1,000 spare cash circa $1,370 to invest in a stock. Nikola looks awesome but I also like PLUG and XL Fleet. Just want to leave it in and revisit in 6 months time. Thoughts??? Is NKLA the best option. Thank you"
Which will go down to $1 first - NKLA or $WKHS? We all know they're both heading there.
average $22.188 holding 3284
Think we can get a 10% down day?
It’s time to short this
"the lockup period ends Friday. 130,000,000 shares to be dumped onto the market. good luck longs"
"whoever sold on Friday , will suffer on Monday .IMO"
This morning was great timing for my calls.
Time to burn shorts looool
seems shorts are worried
Poor shorts I warned you on Tuesday to cover and take your gains. No you wanted to shout your mouths off that the stock would drop to $4. Greed is always the undoing of investors
"This scam is still trading at $13?Hits $10 in a week, next stop $8"
squeeze them hard
why is everyone talking about next weeks lockup? Are there THAT many shares?
Crapola
love it - had to move more money to buy additional shares.

Game Over! Now funds can’t buy the stock cause it’s under $10. Trevor Worm needs to go to prison!
"The Good:* The company has basically 1 Billion USD (assuming they didn't lie on their 10Q/K)The Bad:* They are burning through 400 Million USD per year and this loss is increasing* The founder of the company clearly doesn't believe that the company is even worth 15 USD since he is selling out bigtime. Check this form4 file the beginning of the month. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001731289/000114036121007343/form4.xml Wouldn't you hold onto your shares if you think they would go materially up and even if you need money to live from your not going to sell millions right?* In general insiders are selling https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nkla/insider-activity Nasdaq shows they bought the last 12 months my own records however shows they had 396 million shares in 2020 and 321 million shares currently (counting the amount of shares using form4 is not trivial, I trust my own numbers more though).The Ugly:* Company founded by a scammer who himself bails out of the company* This company has absolutely nothing to show for. Anything that they tried to prove turned out to be a fantasy (i.e. just renderings) or an outright scam.* Proffesional now have more puts (counted from 13F's) than calls on the company (calls/puts 0.86)* Professionals have been recently reducing their stake or completely sold out.Notes:Yes, they have a lot of cash BUT they also have a lot of stock outstanding therefore the amount of cash per share is only 3USD (cash and cash equiv/common stock outstanding). https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/viewer?action=view&cik=1731289&accession_number=0001731289-21-000006&xbrl_type=v#They are authorized to more than double the amount of stocks which will dilute current shareholders."
This is the future of NKLA visualised:
"Just some things with NKLA: Remember when the old founder promised to refute all the information coming out in regards to fraud and deception by NKLA? Then he went quiet on social media which he use to be super active on? Then he made all his accounts private? Then he deleted all his social media and NKLA as a company had to get him to step down because it could threaten them as a total equity at that point? Then remember how NKLA had to admit to the accusations? Come on guys this isn't hard, don't allow yourself to be mislead due to emotions."
"""The company said Jesse Schneider, executive vice president of technology, hydrogen and fuel cells, left the company as of April 1.""He got a better job, paving driveways in Hawaii."

Broke the 13.74 resistance today. Could have some up days based on market or some down days but this is a slow descent too delisting. I doubt even original IPO price at this point.
"100s of examples where directors sell the shares and prices gone up..you can find plenty of article on google..directors sell or buy does not indicating future of the company so chill..and some one says he sold his all shares and he is holding ZERO shares..for your kind information ..Before sold out holding was 82,951,640.00 and now holding is 79,082,045.00.Following is the copy and paste information from brokers website.He didn't even sell 5% of his holding..31 Mar 2021 Milton, Trevor R N/A Regular sell transaction (market) 3,500,000 $13.89 $48,615,000.00 79,082,045.00"

"I am trying to write a post here regarding keeping your shares out of principle. I don't need the money. I just dabble for fun, but this one has become a passion of mine. The company is brilliant, and they have a vision...they are backed by some of the biggest investors in the world. They have agreements with huge players. Their factory is almost complete, and they are trying to create a clean environment. They are the first in their field, and yes, things take time, but its gonna be brilliant. There will be grants in Europe to hauling companies that are green. There will be compensations on road tax etc. Those things will make up for the heavier trucks. (Batteries are heavier than fuel) anyway. Its a brilliant company and idea. I support it regardless. Dont be a stupid basher and only use the words fraud, sexual harassment, rolling downhill etc...I'm so looking forward to revenge when you get stung."
They wanted to do a 100 Million share emission. With the price going lower and lower that will be one hell of a dilution.
We appear to be headed into the $10 range. And soon.
The time to average down? Will be at $0. We will be there in not too distant future.
GM will buy it out for a dollar
Lol at the fake run up
Looks like Mr. Milton is stashing some considerable cash so he can fend off the mountain of lawsuits that's about to land on his desk.
I am not sure about those whoever bought in 60s and 70s but whoever buying in this price cant go wrong for 70-100% profit couple of months..dont listen to derampers ..they either want cheap shares or want to close their shorts..do your own research..long term this will only go one way which is on higher side..looks very very cheap at the moment..good luck to all holders...

"Nikola at $11 and change? How could that be? With such good badger technology and all the hydrogen being produced, this stock should be at $400."
"production begins in Ulm, Germany in 1 month. Great news, NIKOLA already has the latest truck models in validation tests. The future is promising."
Is $NKLA actually making these trucks yet?

Insiders selling is the proverbial nail in the coffin. DOA STOCK.

Not sure what is wrong with this stock but at this pace will be below 10 tomorrow.Why are the sellers huge and just pounding the hell of it??

This is nice

Nikola + Earnings = Scam confirmation
Trevor sold his shares so that other people can ride the shares up to $300 to share the wealth. Just need to find people gullible enough to believe that for next pump.
I think it will hit 20 by 2030 if that soon.
Milton ran away with the cash and you guys sit here holding bags  just don’t see this company making anything for at least 5 years and will have to raise money in the mean time . I think hyln has the market cornered but good luck to all of you!
If you are patient u will reap the fruits.Don't let the shorts scare you.Don't sell and later regret it.Save this message
"12,000 shares strong"

Trevor left such huge voids in the foundations - the risk of collapse is anytime in the next 2 years and big boys known it
Breaking news: the Nikola 100 truck deal negotiations video leaked:
—Chill. And I’ll buy more...
Huge news. Nikola said they will buy portable hydrogen tanks if they ever build a working truck. Another “partnership” deal. Amazing.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Love the discounted price on NKLA.
"Simply the best natural gas conversion, hydrogen infrastructure, fuel cell, battery technology, powersports, watersports, defense company, logistics company. Many people are saying really great things about this company. Very sad what they did to Trevor Milton. Very sad."
"Don't sell your shares and loss your money, play like long term investors. This will up again very fast. EVs and renewable energy are the best investing sectors in future."
Saw Nikola stock at the dollar store today..... it was in the clearance section.
YES. Strange trading . I see that too. I see strange trading since after earning. And don’t forget last downgrade from JP Morgan from $33 to $30. So NKLA still $13 lower from JP Morgan downgrade. If NKLA was bad for JP Morgan then downgrade should be $15. So in my opinion JP likes NKLA. Good luck to all.
Nikola is starting to put somethings together.
A Korean and Bosh has liquidate their holding from Nkla and now Nkla key person also leaving.

"Trevor Milton: Thanks everyone for believing in this company. A vision was set forward in stone that Nkla was to be the greatest company that ever existed. We have the latest technology and most advance vertical integration on the planet. Our trucks are the future and will continue to evolve everyday. I also want to give thanks to all the smart investors holding the line. I made a bunch of $$$$. see you guys. thanks, T"
Single digits 
"Still the undisputed leading hydrogen infrastructure, natural gas conversion, battery technology, logistics, powersports, watercraft, EV pickup, hydro-electric trucking company on the planet."
Gosh I was going to buy this stock but after reading the scams they did and they were not jailed I decided to wait till 2.23 as a entry point. Great possibility it gets delisted I think
Easily the best and safest EV play in the EV space. This is truly an investment you can lock in and not worry about for years. 500 shares at $38 average and it’s not keeping me up at night. I’m actually looking at possibly doubling my position to be honest. NKLA is going to be bigger than Tesla and NIO combined one day that’s how bullish I am on this fine company.
might as well short this stock and make your money back on puts.
Slapping myself for not doubling down !
seems like a hollow attempt to ease the selling pressure
Nice movement today
Breaking news: first spyshots of Nikola prototype for NASA tender Mars mission.
People should consider selling now before this goes backdown to $10 once the hype is done.
"Just some things of NKLA: They always seem to have a ""New Big Deal!"" or ""Here is the huge update!"".... Notice how it never turns out to anything? Don't get emotional, don't get attached. This is business. Know when to sell. And if you were involved in the equity before the fraud came out there is countless class action lawsuits you can join and also write your local and state representatives along with the SEC and DOJ. You deserve compensation for being mislead. That is called ""Violating the fiduciary trust""."
There we go! Let's get this under $10.
shorts better cover premarket
best stock ever i love it
"I adore simply pumpers. Did you know there are pumpers even after a company declares bankruptcy? Just wonderful. This was going to zero after the merger, enjoy!"

"I have been adding at these levels...whenever I could. Once NKLA starts rising, we will never see these levels again."

It’s literally cash every time. If you're currently holding I am sorry, if you are on the outside looking in literally buy some asap. It will hit $30 here soon, trust me lol. Its the Hindenburg effect. This time $ride at 50% discount. Previously $idex $sos $nkla"
"See you back above $30 by year's end:""Nikola said in a statement it’s nearing completion of a second batch of battery-powered prototypes and has begun the assembly of a fuel-cell test vehicle at its headquarters in Arizona."""
This is just about to lift off.....maybe one more pullback to load more. This will balance out over $30 in the near future
Letter of intent = another NKLA scam.
Single digit
Just bought in with calls. Moonshot
As Iveco continues discussion to be bought up by a Chinese conglomerate. Nikola becomes more meaningless to them.
Will you guys buy at 5$ or is it too much for this company?
Picking up some assets at auction is my entry point
Instead of buying at the current price I wrote 40 October 10 puts for 2.00. I don’t know how low this will go.
BOT. All negative comments about Nikola to make you scare sell. I am not selling until it hit @$60+ period. I AM NOT SELLING I AM NOT SELLING I AM NOT SELLING I AM NOT SELLING I AM NOT SELLING

"That is because the May 21, 2021 $7.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
"Watching Hyln pass NKLA by.,...."
Nikola is moving in the right direction! Getting more and more positive about this stock after Trevor left. And remember this is only the beginning!
"If you want to see a Semi truck Co stock do as poorly as NKLA, just look up HYLN. Supposedly has a better solution than Nikola & can be executed with current infrastructure, yet Hyliion dropping like lead weight."
"News had nice influence on other fuel cell stocks like plug and bldp, but nkla itself is still shorted. Short can not let the wind turn to tornado. But that is not for too long. I hope."
You have smart investors buying Tesla and NIO then you have dumb investors buying this
Looks like this board is all shorts .
We all bash .. but I roll the dice on 2k shares ...either zero or $35.00
I thinking about shorting again to $11
nikola stronk today
"What and absolute joke $NKLA, the complete scam with basically zero revenues, is currently valued at almost TWICE $LEV, who is raking in hundreds of millions in orders left and right, has multiple Govs backing it, partnerships with Ikea and Amazon and others and a massive factory half built. This is ridiculous."
The way they build out their infrastructure it should be done by 2025.

"Excuses me, Mr Shorts, where is the 78 cents stock promised? Here we are still waiting!"

"$9.50 is the 5-year low. If it breaks that, none of us know how low this will go. Are there any suitors out there that have an interest in buying NKLA?

"Even if Nikola manages to build the factory on time (which will take longer than most people here think, the factory is not just the building, but what goes in it, and the staff, staff need to be trained, etc.) and start rolling trucks out, there is, and won't be for a while Hydrogen infrastructure which will pose a challenge for fleets to go Hydrogen. I think, and hope that Hydrogen becomes successful as it' good for the environment, but realistically It won't happen for quite a few years. On the other hand, Hyliion ($HYLN) has solutions that offer clean transportation leveraging existing renewable natural gas infrastructure, and are fuel agnostic for when hydrogen and BEV class-8 infrastructure becomes available"

"its a fraud company, its soooooo obvious, how can people still hold or even buy more"
"I would invest in a Hydrogen fuel production, storage, and distribution network if all (most) of the money went straight into building the infrastructure . (But not Nikola obviously, the money goes to the fraudsters). (And I did invest in Nikola!)"
"My heart breaks for the people that got in before the fraud and lies came out. The fact that the founder was known for bad business, that he put his friends and family in the company at high levels off shareholder capital (His brother was even put as lead of the hydrogen development team despite being a home repairs guy that layed concrete...), the truck without the engine, the founder who got forced out and who ghosted then deleted all social media. the countless class action lawsuits, the list just goes on and on.For those that got in after all of this and held you are newbs and were lazy and greedy and this is what happens.For the day traders though that pretended to be longs to sucker in newbies in order to scalp them you are literally the worst. You have sold your soul for money.NKLA is a dumpster fire and so is anyone promoting it."

Dont worry folks. There's still Travis left. Your Hydrogen expert with zero experience.

from the 6 month charts i see a trend. the stock is headed down with minimal uptakes and then down again. my prediction price for the next 6 months is anywhere from 0$ to 6$. Now pay me for advice
Go Hydrogen!!!

"April 30, big day. Rest of insiders will show their true color. Trevor has been selling like crazy. Google nikola sec."
Nikola's shares should move higher. Nikola plans on production of FCEV trucks by 12/31/23 if everything goes according to plan. Nikola is clearly the leader in battery and fcev trucks. Nikola's production plans are on top of the successful partnership deal to buy electric from Arizona Public Service Company. And on top of Nikola's earlier successful partnership to buy water water and sewer services from the water utility company. Nikola is now doing another secondary to guaranty its visions become reality. Shares should move much higher.
"wonderful company to short, fundamentals are so bad, it's easy money "
"all year round, these special kids keep saying it's a good time to load up. well, here's another good time to load up. next week, more good time to load up. it's almost $2. load up."
This going down just like a sandal 
Why would NKLA need service partnerships across the country? Maybe they are more legit than anyone believes.
A $4 billion market cap for drawings and a fake truck 
back to 10. Why Why Why?
News from insider the target is $100 again but this will take maybe one or two years for now we would like to get $40-$50- earnings time I would say $20

what is all the talk about lockup period ending?
I heard the statement from ceo on CNBC ... he appears confident and honest ..
"Next Monday, Nikola will come back with big news don't sell just hold guys "
this company is the next tesla. put your life savings into it.
Nikola is in the same vein as Theranos. No one wants to be associated with them. None of the large buyers of trucks will touch this turd.
GME style short squeeze coming to a theater near you. 
Can anyone explain why this is up? It never made a single car in whole company history.

RIP Shorts 
You can sell your shares tomorrow will buy more shares by same money

Lots of chatter on Reddit about the epic Nikola short squeeze that’s coming. Looks like the redditors are gearing up for a raid.Be ready!

"A lot of people unfortunately don't know all these details so they wonder why their ""investment"" keeps falling. I will help fill in the blanks because I honestly feel sorry for a lot of you that are new to ""investing"".NKLA = Started by a guy that has multiple lawsuits against him for starting and selling businesses using misleading information.NKLA = They chose the name in order to get people that thought they missed the boat on investing in Tesla. The deception started right from the beginning sadly.NKLA = The company that had to admit that their big tech reveal never existed and instead they pushed a truck with no engine down a slanted hill... This is why we make the jokes about gravity on this sub.NKLA = The founder and others got forced out because of misleading the media and investors and first ghosted on all social media and then deleted all social media.NKLA = Came out as a company and agreed they mislead people.NKLA = The company was stacked with the founders friend and family who had no experience or expertise in hydrogen. The literal brother of the founder was put in charge of the hydrogen development part of the business despite doing basic home repairs and laying concrete his whole life.... It is why we make the jokes about concrete on this sub....NKLA = Many times offered literal cash and free stock to companies like GM and others. None of these companies accepted because the cost of doing business with a fraudulent company was not worth it. Additionally most companies have came out and said NKLA has nothing to offer regardless. At this point they are spending your shareholder money doing back yard amateur projects. If you believe in the EV market or even more precisely hydrogen there are a lot of places doing actual research and work and not just blowing shareholder money to pay their inflated salaries.NKLA = Has investigations by both the SEC and DOJ. That means Security Exchange Commission and Department of Justice...NKLA = Numerous class action lawsuits for misleading investors and mis-spending shareholder money.The list literally goes on for pages but I have kept it semi concise to help a lot of you out. This company is literally going to bankruptcy or delisting. Every major analyst and firm has stated this. No one wants to touch this company with a 10 foot poll due to the stains of corruption and fraud. It is a literal meme on the internet of one of the worst stocks in a decade and a complete fraud."

So who here fell for the LOI pump and dump? Trevor thanks you.

Attention: Robin Hood patriots 62 million shares are shorted here!! Let’s make them pay for going against clean energy Hip hip hooray!!
CEO sold a lot of shares.. What's the plan guys?
Any bump in share price is their opportunity to dilute again to raise cash. Remember CEO said they needed to raise cash again this year.
I can't believe Trevor is giving up his shares back to the company. I guess he really does want to see it succeed after all.
Won’t drop lower than $9
I’m buying more
Will Nikola sell “anything” this year? Legitimate question.
This is going to the 20s.
Trevor at shareholder meetings:
"$NKLA - 5.3 Billions MarketCap , $LEV 3 Billions MarketCap One is a complete scam , the other a real company $NKLA dream to be like Electric Lion"
"What Trevor does has nothing to do with NKLA, he's not involved and the new executive team has moved on without him. All analyst have a buy or hold, including new ratings. NKLA is a real player with a real team - founders often F up"
Who's ready for another run!!!!! :-)
Breaking news: National Transportation Safety Board rejects Nikola's claim of active low clearance system for its trucks:
"Why is everyone so excited because this is up $3? 90,70,50,40,30,18,15,13,10,$9. Then to $12 in a week and suddenly the sky has opened and this is the best thing since sliced bread."
Thank sleepy Joe
"$90, target in early June "
—(Buy) order pending: $10.07...I bought at $10.87 and $10.47 -that’s for all you “no you didn’t” people -so you can verify -in 4 months when this is $23+ ...
they've said plenty times they'll be raising $ soon. why so shocked? this was expected
Is today the end of lock up period?
"NKLA already signed an agreement for a hydrogen fuel station. They will announce it by end of this month or next month,"
Tell me whatever you want to holding 700 share I still think nikola scam  I will wait few more days if still go down  take my lose and out
it's lower now than the old bottom Christmas Eve last year. means it's heading lower

Let’s go $5
Those who waits for all time low would be brutally disappointed this is at 30$ in no time
"Better get in before the weekend. With stimulus news and Nikola posting YouTube videos and factory updates, this thing liable to JUMP on Monday. Still a bargain price at $17 tbh"
sell in May --> bombs away
"The SEC, should consider criminal charges againstsenior management."
Imagine getting into coma June 9 and waking up to $9 share price
Back to the same price before the run up a year ago. One of the biggest pump and dumps in history
NKLA is gonna sell more cars than NIO and TSLA combined one day and u can hold me to that I know for a fact this company will one day become the largest ev player in the market and the most well known car manufacturer in the entire world people don’t understand the potential here and it shows
Back below 11.50. Really gonna start falling now!

This baby is ready to pop my friends.

I’d buy it when it reaches $1/share

I drove by a Tesla semi today on the 880 freeway pulling a loaded car hauler. I’m sure the Tre development is miles ahead of Tesla. Go NKLA.

Cathie Woods believes that stocks that go from $90 to $13 in 10 months are usually bad investments if there are no revenues being generated. Sounds like Nikola to me.
—$23+ “proprietary” or not. Coasting to $23...
really strong in a weak market today?
Who shorted this? Bwhahahaha!
People still buy this fake company?
"Mark my word, NKLA will be $100 by December...I agree with the others who are also predicting this"
I am doing research about NKLA stock. Can someone confirm please that NKLA has only 4.5M debt only and 845M cash in hand approx??? thanks
On a personal note: We named our rabbit Trevor.
69 here holding long
Trevor the Molestor is partying with your money.
Nikola disclosed the equity grants to Worthen and five other current and former executives—worth more than $560 million—in a Monday securities filing ahead of a $100 million share sale by the company. Thank you investors.
I guessing shorts are smart enough to know we past bottom! highly... no unlikely we crash and burn. some dips sure. but more upside possibilities than down!!! in deep at 11.60..:)
"9 analyst covering NKLA, 7 hold, 2 buy."
with the price of raw materials going up and with the fed looking to raise rates over the next several years this LOI is definitely going to translate into orders
"A good sign, going to be interesting in the coming days.. targeting $40 this month"

Check today’s market daily volume . 82 million shares/ 13 million average shares in just regular hours. Additional volume before and after hours. Can anybody explain this?
next step 0
Low volume of buyers causing stock to plummet not shorting
This is the best stock in the World !!! Oooooooooooppps
Trevor is sitting pretty with his feet up at the $32 million dollar ranch he bought with YOUR baggy money.
why would anyone go long on this? have you even looked at the company? they're a FRAUD.
I love watching this scam burn 
Think of it this way. When there is mania in a certain segment of the market things get a bit crazy. Companies that really aren't worth anything get swooped up in the hysteria. That is what happened with NKLA and some others. Now that the mania is dying down and the market in a broader sense is returning to more historical ways of acting these companies that really didn't offer much of anything or in the case of NKLA as a garbage fire of fraud go back to the levels they were at before. Sometimes lower and go bankrupt or delisted. That is what is happening. It is why many of us have been trying to tell you this was what was going to happen since the height...
Nkla starts recruiting staff
No good news and not even a product. But stock is getting higher. Beware pump and dump!

Sales and service:But they haven’t build or sold anything...lol
Cover my short NKLA $11.45 profits live. I will short next bounce above $12 or when Nicholas says he’s buying.
"There has been a huge crash on EV sector, most of the stocks are -50% down, I think it is a good opportunity to enter some best picks. I personally think Nikola has great future once the factory is complete and Tre production begins. Also government support for FCEL and BEV."
" PATIENCE PEOPLE PATIENCE- Sure its “scammy”. BUT that act is done, over; give it time to shed Trevor’s snake scales and the scent of scammy will wear off LOL. SERIOUSLY FOLKS; buy low and hold. Just like RMO DOUBLE YOUR MONEY in less than 90 days REQUIRES PATIENCE "
"Does anyone know the current range of the Nikola One? With so much natural gas available, it's going to be a real winner. Infrastructure is already built out."
Another collaboration. Is that what they had with GM? A collaboration? It took a matter of hours for that to get shredded.
Maybe they need to add a few more hydrogen filing stations to get their stock moving upwards since they are incapable of producing any trucks!!
"Nikola coming with it's brand in the Q4, buy Nikola"
"What happened to all the people posting wallstreetbets folks who were going to save this stock? Where are they now? Jose, how's your $1.2mm position holding up. BTW, anyone see the multiple Form 4's on the SEC board that filed yesterday"
It's a good day for Nikola. We are only -0.15%...lets celebrate 
"Doesn't sound like a scam to me. #bullish on NKLA with 12,000 shares"
"Who would find it reasonable to call Nikola a complete scam, and Trevor should be in prison for fraud?"

5000 more before the big pop to the moon boys
on our way to $13
let's gooooo NKLA
dayum the volatility on this stock is exciting
Nobody seems to have noticed this but Nikola is the easiest swing trade ever. Yes this company will go down long term. But short term based on technically analysis it might see a 20 to 30 percent rise
"Their truck's can coast downhill vert well, so they will sell a bunch and all will get rich,also the Tooth Fairy has just been spotted over their Factory And Lucid motors as well."
dont buy this till lawsuit result is known
"52 million shares traded so far, someone big buys massively"
Once under $10 than NKLA start losing ground
next bubble for sure !
"Wait a minute, there are still people invested in this scam? Did you miss my post a few days ago?This is going to zero, get your money out and put it in a real company (you know the type that actually makes money for you).And something else, in the future, when you see a company founded by a scammer, probably a pretty bad idea to throw your money at it."
+8%!!!! whats going on?!
Short squeeze will send NKLA to the moon.
"Anyone know why Nikola is scheduling 1Q21 earnings release on 5/7/21? It's a Friday after market is closed. Given the news I'm expecting on deals and product development, why not announce Monday morning before market opens and give the shares a jolt upward?"
"Breaking News: Nikola sales increased in Q1 2021, they sold their souls. But bottom line still weak, strong increase in materials cost, due to purchases of drawing boards. Back to the drawing board has steep over runs."
Don't forget avg PT of 10 analysts covering the stock is $27 with lowest being $17 and highest being $47. The stock is extremely undervalued at this point considering The company is into advanced stage of commercializing its Class 8 Electric truck. Yes the company had some hiccups lately but shorts had their time and soon the tide will turn in opposite direction. Today going to be an interesting day as some shorts might cover.
Nikola 2021 and beyond:
Nikola is under Reddit investors list next week .... Buy Big guys ... thos stock is highly shorted ... Next week $50 +
There is no more downside for shorts it’s all risk for them now
Where is that Gravity Drive? Noooooooooooooooooo!
Shorts just cover! Lol
it's the same sheeet. going to 0
"The company said in an SEC filing that proceeds from the share sale may be used ""to complete our Arizona manufacturing facility, develop commercial scale BEV Does anybody know why they said ""MAY BE USED"". I would be OK if they said ""WILL BE USED"". Also I think TM should take moral responsibility of retiring his shares for the amount raised."
pre-market closing covering here boys... i smell a big day tomorrow.
Keep dropping I’ll add tomorrow as well thanks
"Shorts are really panicking today, so much noise created by shorts."
BIG BANG IS COMENIG break through $13.00
"$10 price, NKLA has now come full circle"
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO UP 7% premarket and here we are. So quick to jump at the shorts. A scam is a scam and insiders will sell.
Another drift off into the close or new hi for the day?
How is this scam still trading over $1? I still can’t believe Trevor banked over $1B off of this. Dude should be in jail.
We're going under $13 today!
"Nikola, time for rally? look other EV stock all green"
lol @ new shorts who just bought puts based on today's gains... let's all laugh at them when they realize shorts haven't even begun to cover.

T.V.=P0S.
"Markets collapsing for a week, losing thousands a day. Somehow NKLA making me money "
Thank you Trevor Milton.Stock will be $2 per share soon.
I see a lot more bagholders in the making the way this is going...........
"Check out the Options , $13 and up  today"
"Another SEC probe? Love how they Waited to release this news. See you under $10 in the coming weeks. I really am rooting for this company, but my god they have a total mess on their hands."
only 1 short left on this board? all the smart ones sold their positions/covered?
poor kids could have sold their puts... not anymore..
Truly sorry for anyone who fell for this scam.
"I like the idea of nikola, but it's not for now maybe by the end of the year, when I see. nikola arizona almost complete, and some good news about 2022/2023 the( TRE TRUCK) order."
"—Here’s the “short” version of the “Why” “would anyone buy this here”: Short interest, Puts, inexperienced “shorts”, a nearly forced forthcoming “real announcement”, Hedge funds in, retail following, Margin calls everywhere, short covering, fun “articles” changing the “narrative” to positive/meeting the needs of the self-serving new recent buyers, etc. —That’s “why”...And I’m in...waiting...(I did it on last last go around at $14/$15 -now to do it again here “soon”...￼"
bull
"and....thats the bottom. hate to tell you all I told you so, but......once again....."
"Did this stock hit $14 today. What happened to $93, then the moon?"
"To answer one of the posts, I purchased a large tranche of NKLA stock and believe in it for the following reasons: 1. the potential for the ZEV market for heavy trucks is huge and estimated at $1.5 trillion 2. NKLA is one of a few companies leading this market 3. their engineering and prototypes seems to be excellent and coveted by truckers 4. management is laser focused on delivering electric versions of their Tre prototypes by EOY 5. hydrogen trucks will come out in 2023, which will have them as an industry leader 5. they are also a leader in developing a fueling infrastructure with stations, and finally, they will have billions in sales in the next few years."
If this is such a great stock what is it doing at 11.5. Shouldn't it be at 200 right now?
"Bought in 202,000 Shares!!! LETS GO BOYS! 1H = $$$$ 1 or 2 years we rich!"
bankruptcy is coming.
$12.00/$12.50 this week
"here it comes.... bull run, baby... bull run!"
Truly pump and dump. LOL
"Sell the news. Nikola still doesn't have a product to sell to the market. This is coming down another 20% minimum before we start making massive gains towards the end of the year. Nothing to get excited about until they declare the BEV is ready for sale and provide updates on the Tre which is still 2 years away from delivery.Personally, I don't think they should have killed the Badger. That truck looked better than any EV truck in the market & would have generated a ton of interest/sales if they could have made that a reality. They are solely focused on ""commercial"" trucking right now (which isn't a bad thing), but they need to diversify their verticals and somehow find a way to enter the consumer market with the badger.I'm sure it's just temporarily shelved till they get their house in order, but still, killing that truck really hurt them capturing market share in a massive segment that would have garnered a solid revenue stream."
"Shorts, are you here.... oh yeah, probably closing short positions. Soar on Nikola!"
Breaking news: Nikola appoints new Chief Designer. an alumna from Roosevelt primary school:
Holding strong today compared to the rest of the market. Bottom looks like it’s in.
Anything below $13 is a steel. Buy now!!!
In the red. LOI scam not fooling anyone.
Nikola bag holders
"NKLA1. Start trial production at its German joint venture manufacturing facility this June.2. Start production at its Arizona facility in the third quarter. 3. Expects to begin construction of its first commercial hydrogen station this year.4. Deliver its first Tre battery electric vehicles in the fourth quarter.If you sell you shares, you will loss all of these events that will be 20% to 40% jump in share price.This is the year of NKLA and no other stocks. Good luck to all investors."
Another beautiful day in Nikola World.
"Exciting isn't it, will it go below 9 or not (going below 10 is pretty much certain)."
Interesting
Buy buy super price!!! German partner would make Tre truck this summer already!
"That’s it we longs heard what we want to hear. The company is making great progress. I have little bit experience in stock market and based on my experience, the stock would recover quite a bit in coming weeks and months and would be above $20 come Q4 2021Put a high limit order as shorts would want to cover Enjoy the ride and don’t sell cheap as the stock is too cheap at this level. Think about they are going to begin selling commercial trucks which has a huge TAM. They are way ahead of competition in terms of products testing and developing infrastructure."
"Not too bad today, am still very confident that this will turn around."
"Here is a great video comparing Tesla's Gigafactory in Texas to Nikola's factory. I see a lot of Nikola investors holding because construction of the factory is happening. However, they don't realize Nikola scaled back and is only making a pilot line rn. Nikola will not be able to compete with Tesla in terms of manufacturing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRex-UUuIm0"
"NKLA now in single digits. Who would've thunk???? Badger technology. Massive H2 production. Watercraft vehicles. Out Eloning Elon. Zero debt. Massive revenues. Sales to the US military. GM deal. And then the longs woke up and smelt the coffee. Like Houdini, it all disappeared."
"There we go!Down, down, down!"
"We have a nice little race to the bottom with, $RIDE $XL $HYLN $GOEV $RMO $NKLA"
what is the bullish case here? they got caught in FRAUD and have no product or revenue
Wow. all those who bought at $93
"Made a little money off of this scam. Sold on its way up after I read a small story about Trevor's last few companies. Same game plan, all scams. Even he was surprised how well this one worked. Even if they somehow ever get a truck built, the name Nikola is ruined. It would be like suggesting to the bosses we do business with Theranos."
$8 soon bulls
Shorted again
Insider buying!!! Wow.
40 million shorts?
Best time to load of course.
The SEC is moving too slow but the results have to be a disaster for this company. Just a matter of time for a company that officially touted technology and results but had none.
NKLA is a scam. They produce nothing but a paper truck.
Good earnings report 
What is the SEC and DOJ doing about this S C A M which left investors holding the bag???????milton the con job freak is walking scot free and raked in hundreds of millions???? Why is this T H I E F not accountable at all????
"It happened to NIO, a year ago. NIO consistentlt declining and reached $ 10... the bottom. Later it became 5x. NKLA will be same"
What company is under investigation by both the SEC and DOJ? You guessed it again. NKLA = The Dumpster of Dumpster Fires 
—You wannabe “shorts”: This is *your money that I took from ya on the other stocks the last time we played this game... -remember? Love it! $14+
serious positive news before end of the month..hold hold and hold..dont sell for small profit..
"Since June 4, 2020, the S&P 500 gained +33%. TSLA gained +312%.How's NKLA doing?"
They had some interesting insights about NKLA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Single digits are here
Stay positive: still not listed as pink sheets.
Plummeting like a lead balloon people
Shortys is this all you can do :-). Come on...
It may go lower after bounce back to around 16-18. It doesn't goes straight to zero
now comes the rebound...
Does any one believe that Trevor Milton forgot to sell his some shares when the price was at $93 and last Friday sold at $13.89. It is funny and scam in order to accumulate a lot of shares these days from small investors before starting the productions and complete the factory.
WE SMOKIN THAT TREVOR PACK 
"NKLA is a cooked goose - HYLN is fast becoming the indisputable KING for Class 8 EV and Hybrid solutions for the foreseeable future. If you dump NKLA now, book your tax deductible losses, and buy HYLN, you’ll end up with MORE SHARES and VASTLY MORE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERN UPSIDE. If you STAY IN NKLA - you’re going to lose a lot more. Watch what happens Monday.... (I am NOT short NKLA, I AM long HYLN, and you should be too...)"
"If it wasn't for Gravity ,, Nikola trucks would not roll on there own"
"Do the shorts ever get bored of paying these high fees to be short lol some people like to lose their money, it is literally a matter of time before first truck delivery occurs and then we are off to the races."
Monday should be better 
UPS/FedEx/Old D These guys that haul short run hub to center loads need these trucks lots of them. Biggest corporate emissions polluters there are. If we truly go green these multi billion dollar corps will pony up. BTW Video of the truck racing the Ford F3 50 is bad #$%$
Finely there is some good news
8s by Friday
To the moon soon
Trevor selling:
"Things are looking up for NKLA, how are my favorite haters doing?"
nikola make 20000 trucks! buy buy buy!!!
For a company with 845m cash balance with 0 debts. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with nikola. All startup comes from nothing right?
"$IQST and $ALYI both have been decimated. Both have big events coming in June and July. Great buy opportunity. I'm telling you after they crashed, not while they are sky rocketing. IQST has seen $2.00 a share recently, and ALYI has seen $0.21 expected to hit $1.50 in June with their first EV production release, using IQST technology. You do the math. $TSLA $XPEV $NKLA"
We get nice wife when this hits $44
"Just about the only EV stock in the green. And all the whiny shorts here, just can't handle it."
You know it’s a great day on the market when this joke of a company is up
this stock is to hold at least 2 years
This is amazing with the index down so much. Dont see anything to trigger it except people realizing this is going to be a great investment
Is it a buy from these levels?

Going to 0$
A very lucky few got out as high as $17 yesterday. They were the lucky ones.
"Unproven and unreliableNikola's stock has fallen off a cliff since coming public, but that doesn't make it a buy today. The company has refocused on battery electric, but has yet to sell a single one to customers. Wait, Trevor lied about hydrogen? I’m starting to lose respect for this company."

"Nikola and RIG360 expect to finalize distribution plans and agreements in the coming months in order to fully support customers in the sale and service of the Nikola Tre BEV which will be launched later this year, as previously announced. Nikola remains committed to the expansion of its distribution network in support of customers throughout North America."
The short interest on this bad boy is absolutely a slap in the face. I saw something in the options market that had the signs of a wallstreetbets run. Last time I saw that many call options the stock went parabolic.
Down she goes
In my portfoglio of stocks in different industries I have 2 favorites: 1 ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (Nasdaq:ZIM) and Nikola (NKLA). ZIM rose over 400 % in the last 4 months based on strong fundamentals and on historic high profits for Q1 as reported yesterday. NKLA has no revenue so far BUT the outlook is bright and I am convinced NKLA will triple by EOY. Patiently holding and enjoying the gradual rise.
NKLA making another “supposed” deal with another company. Remember how the last couple deals went?.. Fake news..
"let's all take a moment to recognize the poor victims who held puts through today... may God treat them better than this cold, cold world did."
" NOW IS THE TIME TO COVER SHORT POSITION; Made $68,750; NOW Going long with HALF; that’s it. Stop set at $11.00. Hope to see you at $25. By June. . This may well be the turning point for this company"
Remember it went up to $95 last year
Is there is any possible this go back to over $50 again
What's everyone's realistic one yr target
Look at these bears panicking....
Come under 10 if than tomorrow under 9
Whoever doesn’t see what’s coming for NKLA deserves to get run over by the Tre and then by the TWO like a pancake.

Just a heads up to anyone actually on here searching for information. NKLA = Trash/Dumpster Fire. Feel free to review the posts of the others that say different and look at how they have been wrong and changed their story over and over and over for 6+ months straight. I guess NKLA and the founder aren't the only ones full of lies and deception...
Switch to hyln valuation is way undervalued 1/8 of nikola and they have actual sales and realProduct. Good dip to get in right now

"Yes. Everything is in track. 8 new trucks completed. Trial production will start in June. Factory almost completed. Hydrogen corporation in Germany looks strong, and starting in US with completion 2023. Sales/leasing infrastructure and maintenance are in place. Cheap electricity for low cost hydrogen production is in place. This is going up."
why drop today?
Mark my words...tradition panic short squeeze coming soon...watch out for significant pre market price rise in very near future..panic buys at short squeeze are more rapid than panic sells during SP falling time..no matter how people think but short positions are always very very risky compare to long positions...i personally experienced it ..watch out for significant short closer in next few days folks..hold on to your shares..let them burn

"Take it from a NKLA Bull,Hydrogen (the most abundant element) is the fuel of the future...remember too, that at the end of the day, HEV powertrains are driven by electrical current. Therefore, do your homework on Ideal Power (IPWR). Revolutionary power semiconductor design... they have 62 patents on tech that increases the driving range of EV's 7-10%!IPWR has the potential to be a $100+ stock in the next few years."

"I've always wanted NKLA to succeed and still do. However, I saw someone post over on Reddit that NKLA insiders were allowed to sell shares next week and that the price would most-likely go way down. I would pull out and buy back after. Looks like the selling has already begun on the news. This may just be a rumor, I'm not sure where to look for insider-share-lockout type news."

I keep buying puts and nkla delivers like a champ
"So, we hear ""big dilution"" and fear-mongering after hours and PPS has been beaten down 5-6%. Here are the facts as per SEC filings. Nikola is raising $100 m, which equates to less than 6 million shares or roughly 1.5% dilution by the current outstanding shares. That sounds totally meaningless and should not have any impact on PPS except the psychological drama shorts are going to spreading using the word ""dilution"". The question is, why? We recently saw that Nikola is likely not going to go with one big partner for hydrogen but more likely will make small deals like AZ Utility in various regions. Nel and Hanwha will provide the electrolyzers and solar equipment and Nikola will build the hydrogen stations solo (likely) and that means all the revenue will go to Nikola (no revenue sharing). And raising money at this time is likely an indication that they are close to making some land acquisitions or sign leases to acquire places for hydrogen stations. I think this news is a precursor to some big news..."
2 rapidly approaching
What kind of car can I order from Nikola right now?
Amazing how many negative commenters here. Actually find it hysterical. Not once ever have I commented on a board I have no interest in. But that’s just me. Play on playas. NKLA 15 soon. Write it down!
AGAIN .... insider lockup April 30.. buy puts accordingly
holding 21 share at $69 :)
Buying more now .
Single digits by Friday.
"Take a look at the 6 month chart once. You could closely fit a straight trend line from Feb 3rd to today. Very interesting. If the trend continued, it would be near zero in a couple months. I imagine it will level off sometime before the earnings call. If they can't pull some magic, it will drop again with the lockup expiry where those holding those bags will try to get at least some cash value and diversification. Even if I worked for the company and thought they were the next Tesla, I'd be selling some of my shares to diversify. The only way large selling doesn't happen after April 30th is if they manage to convince them to extend again."
"I wrote 10 days ago; NKLA will be again 90 per share, but NKLA will go down to 9 per share first."
plz shortz morz so we can have a big pop
When the founder sells his shares and the executive leave the company........... it is clear the company has no future.
"Stop panicking. Factory almost done. First truck Tre they tested. Give it time, people!"
That’s the risk in stocks having more % owned by insiders than institutions.

Gift horse.
What company has a founder who has countless private business lawsuits and a history of misleading investors? Ohhh could it be? NKLA again = The worst equity on the market 
this is a pump N dump garbage stock
The fact that there’s people that are still long in this is crazy lmao!
"Here is the simple truth: There was mania in the EV sphere of the market, the general market was also in mania. Things are getting back to normal and EV is dropping off hard. NKLA was never a good company but after all the fraud and other such stuff came out it made this a toxic equity. For those that were invested before the fraud came to light I wish you all the best. There is class action lawsuits to join because you were cheated. There is also SEC and DOJ investigations so I highly recommend you to write to your local and state representative and also to the SEC and DOJ. Try and get anything you can out of this company before they spend it all on themselves."
"Finally, it reaches a single digit"
Congrats on being on the positive !

So I thought the only thing these guys had going for them was building out the fuel infrastructure part of the business but with the head leaving what does that mean? What else are these folks doing to bring product to market as their website is very short on news. I’m a long investor and trying to find a reason to hold on to my stock. Anyone have any good information on new products or breakthroughs which will vindicate us longs?
Mees thinks somebody leeeeks.
Anyone who bought above $40 still holding?
Who shorted this at 9.50?
There's no resistance left. Press releases no longer have any positive momentum on the stock price. Earnings won't go over well. this will slip under $10 and no one will be there to catch it.

Get out of this SCAM. They are not in the long haul trucking industry; Nikola is going to be competing directly with BEV short haulers. They don't have the technology nor the infrastructure to compete in class 8 trucking.

"Bunch of kids on here who don't know what they are talking about. I'm surprised you know how to short a stock. Maybe you're just upset because you bought at $90. NKLA has a new team of executives and board members who are well respected in the industry. Trevor was the founder and wasn't qualified to lead the company, he's out with his mistakes... the company is now in the hands of experts and in a position to capitalize on this EV space. All this fraud talk is BS chatter by kids. 9 analyst cover the stock and not a single one has a sell rating on it."
Did Trevor get locked up yet ?
Zero in the end.

They said before the first lockup expired that they had the first Tre trucks about ready to hit the test track. That was like 6 months ago and not a word has leaked out. So its safe to assume they ran into alot a bugs to work out. Probably frying wireing and batteries. Im not doing much with this stock. Its worthless long and my broker is too expensive to play the short side. XL is a great short right now. Profitable and afordable.

"You know who is probably shorting NKLA the most at this time? People and institutions holding shares that will be unlocked at the end of April. Shorting now locks in their price so profits aren't threatened by share dumping later, they simply cover with their unlocked shares May 1."

"juicy bargain-basement priced pre-market shares... institutions dump other ""ev"" stocks every time tsla takes a hit... we aren't tsla."
The positivity here is just outstanding. I hope nobody gets burned to much when stock gets delisted.
Breaking News: Nikola rumored to sign deal with Amazon on rolling stock. Nikola might deliver 500 roll cutters:
"Trevor says thanks for his billions suckas. Get ready for the reverse 5 for 1 split so they don’t get delisted when the stock price goes below $5. Oh my bad, a 5 for 1 won’t be enough. That would just keep them around $4. Better make that 10 or 20 to be safe. Maybe Trevor will create another SPAC by buying NKLA out of bankruptcy and making it a genetics company. He hears those companies create a lot of buzz and buzz makes him lots of money."
"can we be looking at a short squeeze? Despite the upcoming capital raise, Nikola now over $13/sh. As of 4/30/21, a record 62.19 mill shares short. Can shares go back to $94/sh on a short squeeze?"
"Why are options puts so strong at $7.50? With that amount of volume, there’s zero point to risk getting in at these level because this will be matched down as soon as they announce their secondary share offering. Even a risky day trade cause you never know when that announcement is going to take place. We’re all just waiting for it to come any day now cause Nikola needs money so bad!"
"Another down Day,, Yawn,, Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
8 more days to the earnings!! What earnings!!! Are they kidding themselves!! Haven’t seen any trucks or any sells !!!
"Time to bail, as this one is looking more like Fisker"
Next week

A simple message to leave you on for the weekend. If you come to yahoo finance discussion boards in order to pump this stock because you are desperate to see it rise that is your answer. That is your answer to get out. To take the loss. I know it is hard for a lot of you but it is better than losing everything.
"Watching people desperately trying to mislead individuals on yahoo finance forums is pathetic. In fact I would say it's embarrassing. You are not going to pump a ""company"" associated with fraud that no reputable business wants to deal with on here... Here is the simple truth so people can cut through the clutter. NKLA is falling because the mania of the market is wearing off in particular EV. It is why it spiked in the first place... It had terrible fundamentals, ended up being deep into misleading investors/fraud, family and friend cronyism throughout the company, etc.It is falling below IPO price because now the market knows that all the things that were ""expected"" or ""excited about"" don't exist and the company now has a dark cloud over it. So the original value is no longer there. It is not as complex as all these desperate gamblers want to make it. If you want to invest in the EV sphere or hydrogen development in particular you have so many great companies to pick from. Don't shackle yourself to a ""company"" that has so much fraud and problems. This is business and suppose to be about logic and clear reasoning. Not emotional baggage and cult like kool-aid. For those trying to pump this (hopelessly I may add) in order to sucker individuals in so you can unload you are doing some pretty horrible stuff and that should be your note to just sell and let go. We have been saying it would go back to IPO since the height, you choose to ignore just common fundamentals and common sense. We explained why it would go below SPAC/IPO listing price. It did. And now most knowledgeable people say regardless of bounces or this or that within a year or two it will be bankrupt and or delisted. If you want to put your hard earned money into a company associated with fraud and deception and trust people that have literally been wrong over and over every single time for going on 6+ months then I guess by all means be that foolish. If you want to make some money the market still has some incredible equities and places for profit :) Best of luck :)"
This stock could go to 20 before shorts can begin to react. Watch and learn!

Nikola has not seen the increase compared to other stocks since the slump in the market... this week is it’s time to start the climb!
lol nice bulltrap.
Trevor at it again dumping shares
Conditions are just about perfect for a squeeze.
I usually invest in Fisker but am looking at entering NKLA. What's the general vibe over here?
overvalued a lot
thumbs up if I should invest in this stock.
"The plan here was for Nikola to be mostly an assembler, while creating an entire ecosystem for FCEV trucks — including hydrogen fueling station infrastructure. That plan remains significantly delayed.Partners to fund the buildout were supposed to arrive last year. They haven’t. Nikola has reached an agreement for two stations that will underpin a route between Phoenix and Los Angeles. But that’s it.Without that infrastructure, the Nikola model is in trouble. A big selling point was that Nikola could offer a bundled solution to semi operators. The company could therefore promise a fixed total cost of ownership.Without fueling stations, that doesn’t work. And then Nikola is just a truck manufacturer challenging entrenched behemoths with seemingly limited competitive advantage."
Good news Today we will hit 15$!
"Trevor Milton, has won the Angelo Mozillo, award,for integrity from East Goshen University."
How low did you think it would go ?
Scam
$NKLA could bounce back why not $RIDE?
Enjoy the week. Friday lock up sell off begins and shortly after they will dilute shares to raise capital.
"So, after the slew of fallout from the Hindenburg report, NKLA finally gets some substantial, positive news. NKLA paid a stupidly huge heavy price for that short & distort hit job. Only morons who knew nothing about the company thought the ""rolling truck"" was deceptive. Only morons couldn't see that Trevor Milton was way over his skis and exaggerated everything. That's why he was removed as CEO. Where is Nikola in its business strategy? They are testing the first EV trucks, the factory in AZ is moving along on track and they are partnering to advance their long term goals. The US is just now (but too late) realizing that the transition to EV and H2 fuels is inevitable but now must become a Manhattan Project to succeed."
Curious as to why anyone would want to own this stock? It's a total fraud. Im surprised it hasnt been de listed.
"congrats to all longs! i am on the bear side of the stock but i have to admit i was surprise by Nikola corp today. Respecting the deadline is very crucial and important and even if they dont have enough major partnership yet, they are slowly building without burning too much cash. Have a good day all!"
Now we're cooking with gas.
hey look ! Nikola invented a flying car!
1000% this ain't a fraud company big things happening by end of year
I guess this stock only make rich richer and poor poorer.
Buy ctrm
Told. You. All. 11 is imminent Last And best chance you will ever have to buy the next big thing.
"A classic textbook double bottom is forming:The double bottom looks like the letter ""W"". The twice-touched low is considered a support level.The advance of the first bottom should be a drop of 10% to 20%, then the second bottom should form within 3% to 4% of the previous low, and volume on the ensuing advance should increase.The double bottom pattern always follows a major or minor downtrend in a particular security, and signals the reversal and the beginning of a potential uptrend."

Its been a while.....Trevor Milton should be locked up
BOUNCE .!!!!!it's going up from now on NO MORE DRAMA
Buy dogecoin. Thank me later
"Lastly you deserve better than NKLA. You worked hard for your money. Invest in companies that actually work to make you as a shareholder richer. ""Companies"" like NKLA instead look at you as a mark in order to use up that shareholder capital in order to pay themselves. Do not be hustled or used as a chump in order to make them richer."
Insane volume today. Big fish are continually getting in when they can before $30+
"founder selling his shares , you guys buying?????? Hellooooo. wake up"
—Bought a few more @ $10.67.
i bought 500 shares
No brainer investment for next couple of years. This is still new company. Ladt few weeks were great buying opportunity. Watch the latest video on ytube ...great summary and what is comming.
"Here is the reality, NKLA has nothing to offer. They never got anywhere in development and the videos they release and pictures they take are backyard hobby level just with a lot more shareholder money to burn through. Don't pay for someone else's fun day. Especially when there is never going to be a hope on developing on that money you have already given them."
THIS WILL BE HUGE.. IVECO (Ticker symbol CNHI) is not just any company that build trucks. They are one of the biggest all around the world. Meanwhile German gas network operator OGE is very popular company in europe. They'll finally make it to built the hydrogen distribution refueling. Thanks to them NKLA will rise in a striking way in near future.
any news down 5 percent ah
Can they show an example of the TRE rolling down a hill at least?
buying some here $NKLA
When this was $30 I thought I missed out and no one believe it can be $9 and never know what is next
Where is our 20% pop??
Poo poo company I’mLoving the shorting
New truck will arrive in USA soon.
Once it plummets to 9 on May 7th I’ll back up the truck.
"I can’t believe the stock is down today after NKLA partnered for TWO whole gas stations! Fleets could start out in California, drive 350 miles outside of California and then turn around to (hopefully) make it back to one of those stations! What is it that the market doesn’t understand about this company’s rapid progress?!"
Here we go!
I feel sorry for those who bought at $90 lol
wow i remember this last year when it first opened up..........stuck at 69 but all worth it .
"Like I said on April 5, NKLA will reach New All Time Low soon and will trend below $10. Today it reached new all time low, and still trending downward below $10 soon because the assumptions about its revenue and business at time of SPAC are no longer there."
"Today, Nikola registered $100 million worth of shares to sell. This was previously announced, but this is another concrete step forward to actually selling the shares. SEC filing here: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001731289/000119312521092697/d128833ds1a.htmFrom the SEC filing: ""Approximate date of commencement of proposed sale to the public:As soon as practicable after this registration statement becomes effective.""It appears that they are in a bit of a rush to sell the shares. Maybe before the floodgates open After April 30th when all remaining shares get unlocked for sale."
"Something is up, look how much weight is being offered on NKLA june calls"
Wasn't there a few Nikola supporters back in the day? Where are they now?
nkla should close in green ...there truck is working in cold temperatures 
What a joke of a company.
"I don't know guy, but this thread became so much more fun to read recently. Any good reason?"
"nkla is competing with the big dogs and will not make it. if it would have started when Tesla did and produced maybe it would make it. But now the whole auto industry have the same goal with factories, employees tools and backing."
Seems GREEN market fake and red real - they are trying to rise Nasdaq and push all companies down - that what I noticed and don’t know why .....thank you

The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT!

Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue!

Why are they doing a secondary public offering when the stock price is near the bottom of their range? Wouldn't they be able to more efficiently raise funds when they're near the top of their range? Say 25+? Bonehead timing.

"Nikola was originally intended to be a US marketing brand and assembly facility for Iveco BEV trucks and distribution. This would give them the ability to bypass current dealer channels as BEV trucks will require minimal maintenance, the main profit for dealers.

Seems like good news right?NO numbers, NO dates, No deal announced, No Terms of ""Collaboration"" or ""Partnership"" no budget nor financing.OGE simply raisies its hand and says ""We want to help build Hydrogen stations in Europe"" (where IVECO will sell NKLA branded trucks)That's it! Zero details, just buzzwords"
How is this scam still at 4.5 billion valuation
All they are trying to force sell many retail investors margin account
You guys are piling on but this is still a 3 Billion Market Cap. It should kick up at some point to at least $15. My number is $13 but I'm not selling
I have 200 shares costing over 11K but negative $3.8K.I know this company was over valued w/o any products but trusted knowing VW and Billy boy were among the bigly investors. I feel bad about reading weakly document or presentation or write up as whatever it may be called but alarmed by my inner doubt knowing that $NKLA was a scam that proven right by the shorting firm Hindenburg. I am disappointed and sadden. I hope QS is not another NKLA of 2020.
let's go downhill
"Now if folks here bought Tesla at the dip, you wouldn't be reading this while crying in pain."

"Nearly all of the EV stocks are tanking, nothing specific to this puppy"

Theres ur 10 cents
These crooks know when to fry the longs ..Price target lower to $ 13.00
$NKLA recently upgraded to $25.00 a share. Double that money
Even Nikola management knows that $16 per share is the best price they will ever get for dumping additional shares on the market. That says a lot.

Can someone give me a bull case for Nikola? because I really don’t get what people are seeing in this company
"Markets having a good day, yet Nikola is barely moving. What happens when there’s a string of down days in the future.As I’ve maintained all along...We go lower!"
Sometimes a guy just gets a gut feeling that something big is about to happen and that’s exactly what I’m feeling rite now for nkla hands down the best ev play in the market as we speak
Nikola investors might think the risk/reward balance has come to the point where owning shares is a worthwhile bet on the growth of a hydrogen economy that has real potential. But investors should also be aware that the bet is still mostly just speculation at this stage. Same as speculation regarding meaningful progress with their vehicles.
2 years to build 2 fueling stations. Congratulations. What a goal. Always take small steps. In this case tiny little millimeters. Don’t want to scare the billions invested.
More contracts coming!!!
Company was smart at least they raise more free $$$$ @$16.00 ....they knew it is the best it is good to go for now .
There was a time when Nikola was seen as Tesla's biggest rival when the company was valued at $26.3 billion after going public last summer. That's all in the past. Those days are long gone.

"Nikola founder Trevor Milton sold more shares in his former company—again, but this one doesn’t look like a traditional sale. And the strange move seemed to drive down the electric vehicle maker’s stock on Monday.Shares of Nikola (ticker: NKLA) were down 7.9% to $12.81 in midday trading. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, by comparison, were both up more than 1%.Everyone is BEARISH it seems, we’re going lower guys..."
My 2 centsThere is no way shorts can keep their positions open at this level. It’s too risky at this level so expect a spike this week which would take the stock above $16+Don’t be afraid to add at this level as risk is low and reward can be excellent
SELB-ALTO-$$$$$$$

"I think as we get close to Friday you may get a price boost as some shorts get nervous in holding through earnings. If they have good things to say on progress of the prototypes then it may jump. The new management team is really key to getting this business successful. Long haul trucking using green hydrogen is certainly part of the future, the question is how fast this proceeds."

"Just some things of NKLA: Even with offering companies like GM free cash and free stock the companies didn't want to do business with them. The stain of ""Fraud"" and ""Fake"" wasn't worth it. Plus at this point they don't have viable or developed tech worth the partnerships. Other companies are further ahead and doing more unique and growth orientated opportunities."

nasdaq going green.. look out..
2DAYS TILL EARNINGS The restatement is driven by changes in the accounting for warrants issued by special-purpose acquisition companies that have the potential to affect all SPAC-related companies. The stock is holding its ground.
has the SEC investigation concluded?
Trevor bailed out with $49 million. What yal think is this going down or up?
"I don’t understand why this is down. With all the fake drawings of the BADger, they can easily sell some NFT and make a few bucks. I guess this is gonna have to go to $.0001. Looks like a BK company."
"17,000 shares of NKLA."
$8 price target soon
"Does any have idea on what price should be good to enter price for this Stock? There isn't much financial I can reference, and lot of these websites says hold or avoid NKLA. Seeing Tesla and Nio climb so I want to get in as well. Thank you!"
NKLA now at $12.98. Super cheep!!!!
"I bought more , I like the pain I guess .not delusional thinking this is going to $80 or something . It will def go back into the $20’s and have long term potential when the trucks are actually built and factory is done. Just need some contracts ."
Trevor reportedly filed to sell a bunch of stock this morning for opening Monday. Not joking go to the sec page.
Y drop again
"I could have told you this company will be bankrupt over a year ago, all the warning signs were there. Anyone that bought this only has there self to blame. And Trevor "
Robin Hood to squeeze the shorts till they eyeballs pop they head...hahaheehee
There were actually poor kids who bought puts today. :(
Will buy back under $5 when the lock period ends
new deal news coming like Romeo power??could be then a 30% up day from here IMHO
Bought back in. 1/5 of what I sold at 24. Will continue to buy and hold forever at dips
"What's the pump about, are the doing another offering AH"
Nicola doesn't care about stocks.
"wedbush down grade is meaningless. Based solely on the stock's current price and their prior target. It is true that Nikola is a wait and see story but it was that when Wedbush had the $25 PT. Nothing has changed to the negative since. Actually things have improved, deal for low cost electric with AZ and deal just announced for distribution. I believe the stock is way over sold. If this shoots up to $15-$25, and it won't take much good news to do that, they'll change their price target almost instantaneously."
short sellers psychological profiles are they are addicted to risk taking that takes more and more risks to satisfy their addiction until a short squeeze inevitably wipes out their accountsthey like control so they posts alot of make belief armegeddon posts to hide their insecurities and fear of failingwe are at that stage where the short sellers fall into the fantasy psychotic stage of their addiction where disaster are waiting for them ahead soon

Breaking News: NIKOLA introduces muscle car:
"NKLA is rebounding - short squeeze of 62 million shares in progress.Growth path is clearly mapped in their production status chart.Naysayers are full of BS, as they cannot understand the economics of H2."
This has another leg to fall today.
"@who DAT - yep, they will be first to market with semi EV - period, exclamation point.I assume you saw their production plan chart that published with EPS report."
I see Milton sold 8 million shares at $14.48 on March 2. Is this correct?
Haters gonna hate

At least they can sell the Coolidge Site to Walmart
"Please DO NOT LET market action dictate stock/company worth. $NKLA is up over 3% today. It is a pretend business with no revenue and no prospects for growth. Following the logic, $NKLA is a GREAT COMPANY. Get it?"
I’ve been buying in the under $10 to $12 range last couple of days . I want to be that guy when it hits $93 whenever to be rich 
Just incredible..I just bought yesterday and holding forever!
"Bottom in place, worth the risk for me :)"

I love  you shorties for buying up Nikola stock.
low volume and its still going up... we are almost in the clear boys. keep holding. youll be mad you didnt.
Workhorse is the better company by far. Because they’re actually selling vehicles. I’m not short Nikola because I’m smarter than that. It’s a little like shorting NIO at $4. Totally a bad idea. Workhorse is a no brainer to buy and hold though
"TOP 5 PRODUCTS NIKOLA MAKES RIGHT NOW!1) T-Shirts2) Photoshopped Badger3) Etc4) Etc5) EtcAs you can see, NKLA is a strong buy!!!"
"""Nikola is still a very young company that has yet to ramp up manufacturing and vehicle deliveries. The company expects that it will start trial production at its German joint venture manufacturing facility this June and then start production at its Arizona facility in the third quarter. It also expects to begin construction of its first commercial hydrogen station this year and deliver its first Tre battery electric vehicles in the fourth quarter.

congrats to the longs and the day-traders.... we're all doing very well with this stonk.

This price decline is absurd! I'm calling Nikola tomorrow and demanding to speak with the manager!!
Take a look at the calls :-)

Modesto muted. Who’s next
time to sell short I guess next week Friday hit the 5dollar bellows
"Holy trash talk, I am in at $15 and was quite happy, I will be again. They will produce a BEV Semi!!!! They will sell BEV semi's until and if ever Hydrogen stations networks are set up. Its a rocky ride developing new working tech. If you don't have the stomach for it leave, if you do stay, pray!!!!"
really very nice looking truck￼... looks like it’s not going for them￼ ...

"This stock has been thorough everything! Been watching it for a long time now. I like my risk reward here... may be a long turn around story, but I have plenty of time. Looking for 500 shares, stared yesterday with 200. Will add on dips."
This stocks is very close to bankruptcy
"Tomorrow, this goes up to $15.08"
Bye bye 10
Lol NKLA... The company that pushes trucks down hills with no engines... Need I say more?
Just thinking about how this was $93 at some point. dat burn doe.

Offering was a good thing. Now has extra cash to develop stuff.
"Reddit,Wallstreet betz tons of planning and chatter on nkla....tbio nept ino railnkla junesflying cars rtp and altuRR"
Ouch. Will this end up down 10% today?
imagine holding this scam instead of an amazing company like Tesla
The word MAY get an order of 100 truck.Or letter of INTENT to order of 100 truck.These two words translated to WHO KNOWS.
Take a look at the max graph and you can see this company is now exactly where the stock opened... this means its lost 100% of its value
Buy Buy Buy Nikola final chance. Once this train leaves you won't have any more way to ride this train. Buy Nikola.

Going to single digits. Hydrogen is BS. Costs too much to produce.
Large volume selling going on!
NKLA is finally picking up
So anyone in here that has a lot of money please buy
Still smells like someone took a Nikola in here. Hopefully bankruptcy will eliminate the stench.
Please do not look (only) to Nikola. Look to Iveco. They are already producing in Ulm (Germany) a truck with Nikola badge.The truck will be 2000hp. A monster.In Germany several gas stations already have hydrogen. Many others are going to be activated this year.
"Hello $HCMC investors. I know it takes some level of thinking and maturity to consider oneself as investor. DO NOT PANIC SALE. Simple Analysis: $QS, $NKLA..... have no single product on the market. Yet see how much they cost. HCMC is a real company with real stores and real results and real products. So, if you think Monday is pump and dump, you must look at GME chart. It went from $10s to almost $500. Now look at where it is today. about $200. HCMC is 0.0018 today. If the movement takes it up to $2 in a week, trust me you will never see it at 0.5 Dollars. So get in as soon as you can with the money you can afford to spend on Monday. HCMC IS NOT COMING BACK DOWN ONCE IT HITS A DOLLAR.....................SAVE THIS POST. THAKS. I have to disclose that i am not a Financial advisor and i down 13.3M shares of HCMC and planning to add more on Monday. See you on vacation!!!! This is our time!!!!!"

The whole market is down. This will be up huge tomorrow...JUST KIDDING. It's time for the fat lady to sing......
NKLA will bounce back to around $(16-18) next week.

Investors here are selling their shares. That’s the reason why the price keep going down.

Hope all bad news got over for Nikola! Go forward it should be green. Bought more today.
"Whats going on? been watching this, waiting, patiently waiting.. Eating beef jerky in the woods with my hunting rifle... This broke out. right? lookn good!"
I have another account ready to buy more Nikola when it hit $9. Are you guys even thinking? Nikola is not a $10 share. Nikola is not a joke. Even after scandals (from short sellers ) Company's progress in the recent year is very good.
"Hedge funds shorting this stock will eventually fade away and hopefully they will lose billions on a nice short squeeze. The new factory in Arizona is looking great, you should check it out on utube. Hydrogen will become the cheapest alternative to long haul trucking in the very near future."
Last chance to buy great NKLA technology at $13. Might be at $16 tomorrow!!!!
buy point at about 15 USD. Can we reach this week?
BUY THE DIP I REPEATBUY THE DIP.
When will the funeral service be for this company?
Remember when $NKLA was trading at $93 and people were like “ this is going to $300 by 2021”  my goodness

"Keep buying, only a matter of time before there will be significant changes to the company !"
i have never put a cent in a company whose CEO is a lyer . when you look back at the fight he had with Elon Musk ... I knew from that you could not trust a company with such a CEO.
Why people who sold their position in NKLA are still in this conversation? They are the WOKE investors that act like a mob frightening you everyday. I'm sick of their negativity.
"—Oh oh! “Pay” attention next time. I warned you 2 days ago, but you were too busy pretending to be right. Now you’re gonna “pay”."
Better than expected....I thought it will be like $3
whats the big deal of Trevor selling his shares? it was on wednsday... old story
It’s over
The chances this company will even exist in 2-3 years are about 5%. Maybe less. If you are invested in this you are a 
"And to the shorts, if you are shorting at these prices, I’d advise you not to. Risk/reward for NKLA stock is in favor of longs now at this price. Open your mind and put the fraud thoughts out of your head. Ask yourself if any of the facts presented by the Hildenberg report are actually relevant. Now that they have 5 functional prototypes, most of the assertions are dispelled. And in terms of the assertions around fuel cell technology and infrastructure, they are adding partnerships because they have something. So all of the other stuff is just gibberish. Look at this opportunity as NKLA is leading the race with no notable competition for hydrogen fueled heavy trucks. Don’t miss out believe me. Good luck!!’n"
this company will continue to bleed until they run out of money and go bankrupt if you can’t see that you deserve to lose your money. sell now and invest in a real company
I've just bought more lol.i must be mad
Imagine a company with no product being revealed as a fraud started by a career con artist and people still holding the stock.
to all the short take down to .25c that way I can buy 100000 shares
"When this hits below ten by the end of the month. There might be a huge up swing, re-investing in this, so watch out for a boom and then a bigger bust as people cash out"

"I have an intuition that next week and thereafter the short squeeze will really take off. This week, we saw a preview. I would not be surprised if NKLA trades at over $20 before 5/28. GLTA Longs!"

Its a FELONY to Short a stock and bash it.
This could hit 17 today
Next week $8
Sounds great 
I’m shorting some more

"Why buy this Dog of a stock?Jame Dontino, is considering a NuclearShort of NKLA."
so somethings in the wind that deal must be real. Wait till everybody wakes up.
Back to spac pricing! Time to buy soon!
NKLA is heading towards $20 - $25 this year guys!
Why hasn’t this scam been shut down yet
"If you're long on NKLA, this stock is like having your nuts wired to the positive and negative terminals of Nikola's largest battery, standing nude in your bathtub full of water, then getting maximum power turned on. And standing there for weeks........."
"i really see the feature , NKLA will be at $109 by the end of this year and $250 next year then GM would offer to buy it at $380 but NKLA turn down the offer , thank you and happy new year"
It would be scary opening for shorts tomorrow morning. Shorts will panic.
Nikola still hasn’t produced a product. It has been years! Any deal they had was canceled. They are still using the same photoshop images on the news releases. Bro leave this stock alone. It is not worth anything.
"Investors in Nikola Corporation NKLA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 21, 2021 $7.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
At this point i am down 48%... holding long term
People buy stocks on vision..and think ahead ..whoever bought Tesla 7-8 years back and holding those must be in serious profit ..trust me even there are so many companies with a vision of electric vehicles..all will do well in next 5-6 years time due to demand will go up significantly..time will tell but if anyone think this is a scam company must be living in dream world ..watch out in few months time and rise of this..good luck to all holders
Intent on raising new capital (dilution of current SP) & rising inflation (interest) rates (better/safer places to put your money) bodes ill for NKLA. Going sub-$10.
"The founder of the embattled electric truck start-up Nikola has sold $49m worth of shares in the company, a transaction that posted late on the Friday evening of a holiday weekend. Get out now well you still can.........."
NKLA is easily worth $16.25 with all of the technology and well established partners. It could even soar to $16.45 at some point in the future. Go Trevor!
Excessive stock option awards.....they can exercise in 3 years from now and only if the share price is USD 55+.

Arizona factory, TRE prototype testing, building Hydrogen eco-system both U.S. & Europe, etc. etc. - exciting to see more positive news coming in the next weeks and months. $40 by EOY is absolute realistic. with strong upside in 2022 when firm orders will be coming in."

"Holding 1000 shares at 19.53 and im not selling, collaboration with iveco will give a big boost, it may take years but it will come"
There’s a lot of bashers on this board...which means this is a great buying opportunity
"MY ONLY QUESTION, SINCE I'VE BEEN SHORT SINCE $60 IS, HOW IS THIS STILL TRADING? EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW BY NOW, THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THIS SHOULD BE AT $2.5 AS AN EXPIRING OPTION. BUY RIGL, THAT'S GOING TO DOUBLE DIGITS."
"Breaking news: Nikola encounters delays in hydrogen propulsion, here spy footage of Nikola staff during business hours:"
Another beautiful day in Nikola World. Let the unraveling begin.
NKLA will go up soon..Watch the price...it will hit 30...New Truck is coming to USA for sale
"Down more than 5%, finally good news."
"Tsla VS nkla ... a long fuse, AC vs DC"
Tremendous buying opp. !!
huschhhh!  don't scare it
Down? What?
Back to $20 soon
"me thinks 10s are in the rear-view, finally."
"I think $NKLA will be $90 again it's just question when, but I think will go down to about $9 first."
Next week lock up ends.
"How is that Stock not trading at $1? What's holding it up? Do people honestly think that if it looks like Cheese, Smells Like Cheese and Tastes Like Cheese it's NOT Cheese? Cheeeeesssseeee...."
How low can this go? 7? 5? I’ll buy in a few weeks
"Finally, Nikola has a plan for profit. Selling NFT's of Badger photoshop images. Gonna a be a huge turnaround story."
Whoever predicts Monday's short squeeze will be the hundredth wrong guess.
The end is in sight. This scam is coming to a close.
Thought it would have ran up today. Pumpers taking a day off?
"Only 12.10 to go down, for its true value."
i sold at 62 lol people still buying this funny stock every day down
The reality is NKLA is dead and barely floating. It is almost back to original IPO price and this is with the market still at all time highs. Some major dips in the market and in particular the Nasdaq and NKLA is gonna have some more of those massive 7-12% down days. I feel bad for a lot of you that got cheated on this because of NKLA/Trevors fraud. I hope you join class action lawsuits and write to the SEC and DOJ and local and state representatives to at least get something back because you were cheated.
"sell sell, save the rest of your money you worked so hard for."
This will go under $10 . Below it’s IPO and erase anyone investing in the future. It will be sold or acquired.
sell sell I guess today hit the 5dollar bellows
"NKLA has no proven product or service after fraudulently pretending it did. This should be qualifying factor to consider investing in a company that's more of an incorporated hobbyist group. EV companies are a much better opportunity right now, like NIO, TSLA, and XPEV. If you really want to by in a hydrogen stock, then PLUG should be a long term hold. Milton and his enabling board members will eventually face criminal & civil law suits, which will only bring down NKLA even more. Milton selling shares only makes the news and he'll continue dumping....what should concern you also is that employees are dumping their shares as well after having insight how bad things are on the inside. Stay away from NKLA. It's brand is tainted and recovery is impossible for a couple of years if it can even prove any product/service. Look at NIO, XPEV, PLUG, TSLA instead."
"trevor milton belongs in jail, this company needs to be delisted, and investors should be at the ""factory"" with pitchforks in hand. How anybody buys this junk is beyond me. Stock will be $2.00 soon and thats generous."
"can we be looking at a short squeeze? The news has been bad for Nikola. NKLA now at $13/sh... up nicely in last few weeks. Now we have news of Biden Adminisistration helping battery electric and hydrogen vehicle makers. Short position a record 62.19 mill shares. If so, I see shares going back to $94/sh"
"Wasn't NKLA supposed to have, Dune buggies, trucks, sport SUV and water jet bikes by now out in the market. Not 1 item out. Not 1 plant producing. The mass scale production of any electric vehicle is a complex process. Lucid as a full running plant and as proven how complicated it is. All established ICE car manufacturers are demonstrating their incapacity to scale up pruction. You actually believe NKLA who as never produced 1 vehicle will be able to achieve that? I've been manufacturing for 27 years. I know what I'm talking about . The challenge for NKLA is beyond monumental. 2 more years and NKLA will be sold for parts. Basically their building is production. Nothing else of value. Sorry for all people who invested their life savings."
This is a company that has a lot to prove to everyone in the world. They are making a comeback. LETS MAKE NIKOLA GREAT AGAIN!
So they are not building any factories in Arizona?
"$NKLA It's a illusion to think of this as a bull versus bears fight. Mega millions of shares were unlocked like Trevor's but didn't sell but facing an upcoming secondary and another 136 million unlock at the end of April, shareholders needing to cover their butts and preserve their capital are going to dump shares to make sure they don't lose more. Good company bad company, whatever, share price is supply and demand and supply is going through the roof, price is hitting the floor"
One of the best BEV companies in existence. Great feedback from all of their customers. Their vehicles are 5 star rated. Stock should be $100
these poor shorts would have made money on virtually every other single ev-stock...
bought 2000 share $11.06
Should be good news next week. They want to get as much money as possible dumping the locked up shares. The talk about a possible partnership for two filling stations did not fool people for long.
Guys. Get out while you still can. The company doesn't have cash to support its ongoing operations.
Do you guys realize that the original Nikola One announced back in May 2016 was the exact same type of truck as the Hyliion Hypertruck ERX?
RIG360
"Guys I almost all my stock dropped today and Nikola is one of the best stock today in my list. Of course many expect a big rise, but we have here in forum to many bashers and shortis they licked blood and now they come like hyenas ..."
$5 that is how much this is worth a share
Where is Frank T? A/K/A Frank Thomas in Fl?
Neighbors dog left a big Nikola on my grass today.
how is this still 12 usd :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD lmao burning your cash would result in same outcome.
"JP Morgan said today he recommends investors buying into EV stocks, including NKLA, and has a HOLD on NKLA with $30 price target"
"why is NKLA so hot today, compared to others? someone must feel some squeeeeze?"
someone big buys. Orders too large for normal buyers
I just laugh and laugh and laugh as I add more cheap shares.
Tomorrow we will see $15+. Better get in now while it’s cheap
there's nothing no point to stay down...now must be+23or+24 $ something is worng?
"Breaking News: NIKOLA EV Truck, here staff showing the maxium range: 3 feet, unless you roll it downhill:"
Chapter 11 in a year! Let’s short this to the moon
$NKLA open at $20 monday imo
All EV sectors will go bankrupt soon except for TSLA
what is the news guys?
"Love how CEO trash talked Elon Musk then vanished a few weeks later. SEC never does poo. Sorry if you bought but learn to do something called ""research"" first."
Imagine someone bought at $30 or higher and someone lucky just gets in at $10-$11 and all the way makes Money.... time the other trying to get their money back
Man I have this at $17.50 never average down I think now it is time
"Per 1Q21 confer call, Management has to speak more clearly. They sound like con men. An analyst asked a simple question about the timing of the Anheuser deal. Here’s how CEO Mark Russell responded: “So they, we've shared a goal with them to be on the cutting edge of this, from the beginning, that was their corporate objective includes some very strong targets for them to hit by 2025 for actual operations and emissions reductions. And that's for them as part of imbeds worldwide commitments. So very strong corporate commitment, laudable corporate commitment, that kind of partner that we're looking for, is really committed. And as you know, we were able to do a demo run hauling beer from the flagship brewing St. Louis, using fuel cell prototype. We did that last, over a year ago, right, just over a year ago. And we do share a goal to have regular deliveries being made on a pilot basis by the end of 2021 with Anheuser Busch, and so we're working on that very diligently. The two prototype vehicles that we're targeting for that purpose are actually underway in the shop. And we're on track for that at this point.”"
"Nikola in a nutshell: Zero products, zero revenues, zero customers and zero prospects. None in their 7-year history. A revolutionary sellable product is *always* just around the corner.Nikola is nothing more than an investment scam."
Market up and this dog down
5 coming
the king is Back!!
I'm selling my Tesla shares to buy Nikola this morning.
starting my first short here-
20 next week
look at these new bears showing up who just bought fresh puts... let's make them feel as miserable as their predecessors.
"the options expire tomorrow. Monday may be a boom, missing sellers are increasingly stressed."
"—NKLA to $14 then $21+. Sure, not on value -on relative (“lemmings”) behavior. There are too many doing the same (-short)."
just bought a lot now 30 soon
"It saddens me to see people lose money.Unlike these reptiles who bask in it.I lost money here, but gained a valuable lesson.I invest in companies that have already executed or have begun to execute their plans.I’m done with “if, maybe, probably, etc.....”Lucid Motors is an good example in this sector.At this price, there are plenty of other stocks that are making profits.Take a look at PSFE or MP.An interesting story is PDAC as well.Good investing and luck to all.Evil people will always exist.Its your duty to fight."
BOOM! Here goes the second leg down!
"IDK why all of you worry about the shorts. Take the opportunity to buy and become rich. Once NKLA goes into full production, you will never ever see these prices again."
"The NKLA board is several stages of grief ahead of the ""denial"" party over at RIDE."
"$NKLA...The central bank of Norway drastically increased investments in the maker of iPhones, and in shares of the makers of electric vehicles as 2020 wound down.In the fourth quarter, Norges Bank, which administers the world’s largest sovereign-wealth fund, bought shares of Apple (ticker: AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), NIO (NIO), Nikola (NKLA), Li Auto (LI), Xpeng (XPEV), and Fisker (FSR). The latter four investments represent new holdings for the bank."
Down nearly 90% from the year’s high.
"Nowhere to go but downward.Trevor Milton, should call his next company Wally & The Beaver."
anytime soon
Get back to $93.99 where you were belonging to
"Watching the bagholders try and pump this garbage company on here is embarrassing. The reasoning they have is painful and kind of explains why they are holding this dumpster fire in the first place. Honestly kind of feel bad that some of you actually ""invest"" if this is the level of logic you use."
This is going under $11 today.
nice opportunity to exit this am...hope some took advantage
"Closing above fifty today. I mean quarters, not dollars."
Hold comrades. We will come on top real soon
Well this is a surprise.....i thought wrong again dam
puts are attractive here
$HYLN we coming boys
Will rocket soon.
"here's the dip. let's go, boys!"
Should I buy more Nikola today or wait ?
Nikola could really be the turn around story of the year.
Whoever doesn’t see what’s coming for Nikola deserves to get run over by the BEV TRE and then by the Fcel Sleeper like a pancake.
Big Bounce Coming $NKLA Technical Bounce to $10.75
“100 million for general Corp purposes”...... sounds like legal fees and fines to me. Bagholders still refuse to wake up. Talk about doubling down on a scam
$Nikola Corporation outflow is higher than inflow.. know what that means?! this stock is about to take off boys. remember DD is always helpful 
"How can they be allowed to raise more capital, they are under SEC- and criminal investigation"
why? premarket Bullish
https://youtu.be/1oqqnkkTKVM
Nikola burned another $120 million last quarter. Will require another equity raise before year end. Not looking good.
THAR SHE BLOWS....!
"Captain, call  in the Reddit crew￼!Tell them our Status! Be advised, Massively Short Squeeze in Progress"
Trevor Milton should and must doJail time and in Cuba.Trevor is the Ponzi of his era.
I loaded up on the dip at 10.01! I love a great sale.
central bank of Norway and other index oriented buyers are propping up Nikolas share price ... at some point when no real vehicles become obvious... the selling will become overwhelming
"This is just the beginning of the rebound boys. Nikola has the money, it has the tech, it’ll have the factory by the Fall. Be patient, this is the solution to green long haul trucking."
Tax deductions work both ways! hold to 0 if you want a great tax credit next year
Keep on buying so we can get this to 20 today
Sold on a high note!! bye bye!!
"$NKLA is a Great Example of Buying Potential as it Surged to $93 on pure Potential. A year later still hardly any sales at all, substantially less than the Millions of sales that $OZSC had yet NKLA is $11.50 Now How much is OZSC? .Nine Pennies---> which is a Joke should be far higher. All we need is some TV time and to spread the word to all the other platforms, social media, and stock boards.Need famous people like what Musk & Cuban did for $DOGE-USA"
"Onwards to $5, probably next week or earlier."
Help...I'm worried about getting short squeezed!!! I shorted at $50. What should I do???
Better switch to hyln now big announcement nkla is done after Healy talks this morning
"—You could have bought in the $9’s. But, instead, you paid (spelling incorrect on purpose) too much attention to the noise. You can’t deposit noise. Now, watch real money being deposited on a real move higher... You traded posting “but they’re going bankrupt” for money. Was it worth it? “Pay” attention to what’s “really” important (and hint: It’s not your silly post or derogatory slant). See ya at $23+ whether ya like it or not...End o’ story."
Nikola is a scandal. Only reason it's still alive is because it is American. They should pack their bags and their carton-made trucks and go home.
Too many class action lawsuit against Nikola
"New to NKLA. bought in today at 11.90. Hope that wasn't a mistake, Planning to hold long term."
CEO owns our longs a good news
— It’s just “unnerving“ to be operating with such a lack of real information and being expected to trust that they’re going to do what I view as the right thing this time. (not to mention the lack of communication offered to “investors” as to where they’re “really” at— It’s unnerving. ￼
Boy oh boy what was I thinking on buying this at 69 now I wait forever
volatility on this one is fun
Virgin Galactic test flight was successful. Humongous SHORT SQUEEZE in SPCE stock on Monday.$TSLA $GME $FB $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN $MSFT $BLNK $NKLA $OTRK $CLOV $WKHS $GOGO $WOOF $PUBM
"—Into the $9’s ...Panic! Oh wait, actually, I’m buying a few more."
$2 that is what Nkla maybe worth
Loaded up on puts for the lockup expiration. Single digits coming!
"Nikola, the tide￼ that lifts all ships"
Nikola will be the turn around story of the year. The Tre completely dominates the Tesla semi.
I still would caution buying this in front of earnings report tomorrow or I should say non-earnings
Trevor wants to thank all of you NKLA longs for holding his bags as he makes off with hundreds of millions of dollars.
"Could we get some more of those ""blast off"" GIFs? Those are funny. In fact, one with the rocket exploding on the launchpad would be more appropriate."
Sell Sell Sell NKLA will go down $3.75 end in May 2021
"Not to worry as Trevor still has 79,082,045 more shares to sell to the clueless buyers..."
Company lacks any chance for success.Thank you Trevor Milton.
Serious question how do you think Trevor is spending all your money right now?
this is still a possible short squeeze... just for im gonna risk 1000 shares
BREAKING NEWS:It is rumored that $WKHS has struct a deal with $NKLA to finally develop a business plan. They are considering becoming a real company next!
Come on shorts help me load this spring! Boing!
"I would have been worried if they were just this stock going down. But the entire sector within ev is getting hit right now. Now or later, wall street will think these stocks are cheap. Ask yourself what has changed? And for Nikola well the factory is around the corner, truly the longest they have reached in all their existence. But when they did not even had a product or a factory, people bought them for $ 60."
Big bounce to $15 today $NKLA
And to think this Company had so much promise. Starting to look like Fire Island part duh. When will I learn. And nothing from management about theta they are and aren’t doing. My sense is they are literally going down with the ship. And not one positive poster on this Board that can articulate why one should stay invested. Shame.
"Covid in India is taking everything down, covid tbio is next moderna. Start with thatBuddah the MagnificentPart time fortune tellerNkla junes"
How anyone is buying this is just remarkable. It's just a fraud.
"Maybe 2 fueling stations and a factory that is too small to produce trucks? If done appropriately, maybe a few trucks could be built per week in the AZ facility, but on what profit? this is a joke, who buys this? Cash burn of $120 million per quarter? How will they even survive 2 years to the operational hydrogen stations?"
Still providing me with entertainment.
Come on baby
what happened to the GM deal?
"to short sellers everyone is their enemy, positive news articles, price rises, facts , they just walk away from them to stay control of their short narrativethey thrive to write their own narrative they try to seduce others to join them in the sellingin the late stages of their game to retain control, they will lose their indentity and become the martyr for the greater good of other sellerstoo many answers too many questions - to them its all the same useless information because it does not serve their purpose to continue to fall further into their delusionsit is at that very time the stock bounces rises and then their addiction to selling intensifies and they double and triple down until they fall pry to the short squeeze"
Who are the $60+ bagholder. Check in here. MWAHAHAAHHA!!!!
It’s the end of the bearish trend the next earning they will report their first revenue and the sky isn’t the limit
"A little positive news about NKLA during this earning season, will take her to the moon."
I told you all Nikola is going to zero
"$HMBL after reviewing the app, people are saying the Baja video was fake and not a real display of the app. If that’s the case, this is $NKLA 2.0"
Delisting some time this year is quite possible as cash diminishes and the co keeps issuing more and more shares diluting investors. This is what’s causing the permanent downward spiral.
"I have never witnessed more naive and more dmb ""investors"" than $Tsla shareholders, especially the fanatics in america.While Elon is trying to produce high quality in China – still failing especially in opposition to $NIO s superior quality – for Chinese people, he sells (more) garbage plastic wannabe tin cans to american people, to the same people, giving him their money to burn it down like Joker.Elon himself is suffering under a Neurodevelopmental disorder and so do his fanatics, spreading lies about especially $NIO since months, because they are aware of TSLA s failing upscaling process, we are witnessing with all the quality, security and service issues and because they are aware of $NIO s superiority on all spheres.Elon musk is betraying american investors and potential TSLA customers and they are giving him thankfully their money additional to that .Reminds me of Trevor milton, who betrayed the $NKLA shareholders with a 3 D Model and who took all their money and presented a build solar panel, for him, paid by investors money.Extreme bad news for $Tsla and the outcome will kill all your portfolios soon, only $nio has the intellectual and management capacitys to upscale accurate, as we witness by now, and only $NIO has with that the potential to become a multi trillion dollar ev tech data lifestyle luxury products selling social commerce (NIO app has already more than 6 million users, back in 2018 there were only 100000) tech company by its fundamentals.Sell TSLA and buy $NIO, thank me on 5 years with kissing my nts in one of our NIO millionaire Club houses"
"Wow.. Sector is getting destroyed... Still believe in a rebound, but today obviously is not the day..."
Why Nikola Crashed Today??? Because Hot Air can only stay inflated for a few seconds...........
Just some things of NKLA: Founder forced out due to misleading shareholders. It comes out that he had a previous history of this with past business dealings and has previous lawsuits against him.
I like this stock!! Not Selling!! :))))
Why does this stock look like the UVXY on crack?
What a Flop
"Breaking News: NIKOLA to introduce second steering wheel, to give the first driver the autonomous driving feel:"
"Production of Nikola Motors $NKLA semitruck, a battery-electric vehicle called the Nikola Tre, beginning in Europe in the fourth quarter, followed by a plant in Arizona coming online to produce the vehicle in 2022."
Releasing earnings after hours on a Friday. That can’t be good.
"Who was the genius who couldn't figure out why Nogola truck could only roll downhill???No engine, no hydrogen technology! Only hot air and chains to tow the empty shell uphill and slide it downhill..."
Bought more today
People tell you to sell not because they care about you!! Lol because they are short the position!! That’s all!! Hold hold hold!!
Added 2k here.... Big things coming.
This stock is broken and is not worth averaging down. If you have money to invest put somewhere else and make up for your losses in this #$%$

Nikola is the future. buy and hold
Nkla is struggling today ..but hardworking will pay off ..they are going to be part of 1.5 trillion industry..don't play with fire

Breaking News: leaked footage of Trevor Milton bribing Ryan for servicing his 'exhaust'.

"The point with the NKLA order today is that they are for real with the strongest position in the market when it comes to EV and ZEV semi trucks. Though Milton exaggerated, the Hildenberg report is the actual fraud!!!Good luck longs!!!"

NKLA is up 11.44% to 11.30
REDDIT/GME in effect... GO NKLA GO NKLA
If this continues to hold and starts to rise it could possibly form a short squeeze soon

any hope this dead cat will have life back as I am holding 150 so shares@$28
"I d say this is for NikolaPowerCell Sweden AB has received an order for PowerCell S3 fuel cell stacks from Bosch at a total value of approximately MSEK 25 (2,400,000 Euro). The order will be delivered during the second half of 2021. The order comprises several PowerCell S3 fuel cell stacks to be delivered to Bosch within the framework of the joint development and licensing agreement. In April 2019 Robert Bosch GmbH and PowerCell Sweden signed an agreement regarding the development, production and sale of the PowerCell S3 fuel cell stack for the automotive segment. The agreement includes a joint development of the S3 and a license whereby Bosch gets the exclusive right to produce and sell the new and improved version of PowerCell S3 for automotive applications such as cars, trucks and buses."

—It’ll be fun to see all your names change and watch ya run off when this hits $14.
Stock price goes down and cockroaches  comes out with all kind of negativity
wow... green before noon? what a champion.
Massive resistance at $13.75. Nikola is ready to rocket!!!!
50% today’s up move is nothing for NKLA 500%
The only reason Nikola is higher than Hyliion is because of hype. I think hydrogen is a good play in 5 years. But Hyliion has solution that works now and are fuel agnostic for when hydrogen infrastructure becomes available.
How do you think Hyliion compares to Nikola? Do you see them as a competitor? Why or why not?
"$HYLN conversationHyliion delays their earnings report. It did not happen yesterday, May 11, 2021 as previously announced. The result is the HYLN shareholders are disappointed!"
Lmao. The stock rallies 20% on the news that a company might actually have a product. What is this market anymore
"Wedbush made a great call by upgrading Nikola. If Nikola got credit for all the good things they're accomplishing, shares would be $100/sh. Nikola cancelled some really awful money-losing deals with GM & Republic Svcs. Nikola also cancelled the Badger pickup. Nikola has replaced Trevor Milton w/ more competent officers and Board Members. Nikola successfully signed a deal with the water company to supply its plant in Coolidge, AZ with water. Nikola entered a hugely successful partnership to buy electric from Arizona Public Service Company. NIkola has partnered with RIG360 for Class 8 sales and service. Nikola is partnering with TravelCenters for hydrogen stations. Per JP Morgan, Nikola will soon have a vehicle that can be road-tested. And now Wedbush upgrading the stock. These accomplishments justify much higher share price for Nikola."
"—I’m confident enough in the *environment alone here (to be buying)… Fundamentals, they may improve. The fun part is how many are short, etc. (becoming an intense “environment”). One “announcement” and this is $12+ that day. Not to mention they could get a real contract, move the building forward, etc. and get it together someday… Meantime, I *think this will go up either way...￼"
Any dip from now on I am buying.
I do not understand why people buy the stock this week instead of next week. Potential massive downturn with very little in potential gains
"Today, NKLA was the best among all EVs. Next week will be in $13 level. Enjoy weekend."
"I don't get it, if people where still so positive here after fraud investigations. Why is this thread dominated by bears just now after the recent news"
To thee moooonnnnn

funny thing today is $NKLA is green.
Move along. Nothing to see here.
"Monday, up to $13.3"
"I’ve been saying we were going to kiss $10 the last 2 weeks. I hate to say it, but I told you so. This is a key level that needs to be held. This breaks $10, then we can easily it $5. Don’t want that to happen."
Good news is coming soon
Delisting comes at $5 and the end. Ergo a reverse split 20 for 1 is in the very near future. Post split the price should settle between $15 and $20. For a few years until it slowly drops beneath $5 again and can no longer con someone into lending them money. The good news is a Trevor loves you all for his $35 million home and estate he was a broke grifter and made the sale of his life.
it looks like NKLA is following XL... look where XL is right now.. for sure it can go below $10.. it's no longer a SPAC.. I remember these VTIQ days..
"Dear Nikola bagholder... If you missed NIO in Oct2020 (30usd at that time, 36 today), you have a chance right now. Check the news, and the recent valuations."
"Try and approach it like you would in regular life. Imagine there is a guy in your town that is known for fraud, misleading people, in general being a shady character. He has no experience or expertise in what he is doing and he is associated with those same kinds of people. Let's say he says that he is going to build a reputable business that deals with insurance or logistics, or anything. Would you give that group of shady individuals your money who have no experience, no expertise, are known for misleading people in the past and doing the same thing? Of course not.."

"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Nikola’s share count goes up about 8 mill shares a quarter. Per web article, CEO Mark Russell received $159 mill of stock in ’20. CFO Kim Bracy received $84.8 mill of stock. Even former CEO Trevor Milton received $159 mill of stock in ‘20. Besides no vehicles for sale, Nikola is now flooding the market with free shares for its insiders. As of 3/31/21, Nikola had 392.49 mill shs o/s. This is a shareholder ripoff. Until Nikola turns a profit or at least begins production, insiders shouldn’t be getting such lavish compensation packages."
"Like I said last week and a month ago, NKLA is now under $10 and below the SPAC Price because the assumption about its business and revenue at time of SPAC no longer exists. This will continue to trend downward."
"I said it before, if you are a Nikola employee get out now while you can still scrap this terd off your shoes."
$25 is eminent! GLTA longs 
"I can't believe this dog is still around and has anyone that believes in it. Bottom feeders looking for a lottery payday that might, but won't come."

"As of 3/31/21, Nikola has around $776.8 mill of cash. Only down around $86.2 mill for the quarter. Given this large cash horde, I think Nikola can introduce and sell a vehicle before they run out of money. I also think Nikola can do another secondary and raise more cash."

Why’s it dropping today?Trevor is selling ahead of April lockup expiration?
"Lot of people doing mental gymnastics... This keeps going down quarter after quarter, month after month, week after week, day after day because it is a bad ""company"". It is associated with fraud and misleading investors and no one in any industry that is serious wants to be in business with them. NKLA is literally a meme on the internet of one of the worst stocks to be on the market in a decade. Guys just take your money elsewhere and invest in some reputable companies. It is getting painful trying to watch you change the story when it is obvious to everyone."
Remember if you sell I buy
Just some things of NKLA: Just look at the charts if you are a basic or new investor. You can see this is going right back to IPO or Pre-IPO price (Around $9-10.35). There is also a lot of talk from major firms about it being de-listed or bankruptcy in the next year to two. You don't have to believe anyone but the charts and the fundamentals. Both of which only show that NKLA is going under.
Lockup ends tomorrow. It’s going to be allah o akbar. Rip.

It’s not about shorts or longs. It’s whether this initial fraud company can turn it around and prove its legitimate.

"Just bought 1,000 more shares and will be holding for 10+ years"
Watiting for their earnings.
Ended the session on green with 14mil of volumes. That’s a decent exchange day for NKLA stock.
"Delusional - characterized by or holding idiosyncratic beliefs or impressions that are contradicted by reality or rational argument, typically as a symptom of mental disorder. The higher the stock goes the more I see it."
We could argue all day long... This company has a huge project going on and and has at least 450 employees working for success... I don't think it's a fake company...
"Its simple, you simply sell your shares and switch them into HYLN to see your money back"

"This natural gas/hydrogen infrastructure/logistics/powersports/defense/BEV/light truck company doesn't know what it is or what is doing. It has no path to executing any of it's plans, short of integrating someone else's products and technology (see Iveco ""Tre""). No fleet buyer is going to buy a truck with no dealers, no service, a high likelihood of lease obligations voided by bankruptcy, and a seven year history of vaporware promises amounting to nothing."
"Let's understand this PR. There was a re-org in the company to streamline operations and reduce overhead in salaries+bonuses and it turned out that the exec didn't find a high enough position post re-org. So he leaves, strikes a severance package and this is what we get: a PR. But it is all good; companies that do this sort of cost cutting taking into account realistically their roadmap and finances usually come out on top. It was another relic from the Milton era that needed fixing and has been fixed as of April 1."
"Come to HYLN. Do DD first, but HYLN is a much much better place to invest your $$$ in this space."

And here is the next big thing of information, it is going to get much much worse now that it broke the last resistance down and how the growth/venture side is not going to be the focus in the next quarter to year to come. This is going to go below IPO levels most likely if not delisted or bankrupt. Most analysts are now saying bankrupt. Get out now while you still can. That is the last warning. Look back on my post history and others... We have been warning you of this reality for nearly a year."

"Upgrades recently $AMC to $13, Pfizer $PFE to $53, $TSLA to over $1k, Ford $F to $15.00, $SNDL to $1.50 and $NKLA $GME $COIN $DOGE ?"
"Until this stock breaks below $10, it’s treading water with Fraud. All signs point to get out while you can. Fake cat bounceshere and there don’t mean anything. Nothing promising with this company besides theirPitch to the ownersOf the stock"
Scam popping lol. Still posting photo of a truck drawn in photoshop. Unebelievable this popped 20% just because it’s an american company.
This board looks like Tesla message board a few years back. Lots of naysayers bashing this stock and those invested in it. This is a good sign!
"The Nikola truck is more elusive than the USS South Dakota Seawolf hunter-killer submarine, With more than 4 Million miles of highway, hundreds of spy satellites above are still failing to spot a single truck."
"Haha, why do people still buy this EV-SCAM!?"
This reminds me of game stop gme when it flew over 100
somewhat shocking drop today (at this price)... trevor unloading again?
Remember $NKLA? Well have I got news for you
"—Dear “wannabe bashers” “Pay” attention: Coming “short”ly, more *real buying (and *your reality won’t/can’t stop it). Then, the “analyst(s)” changing their price “prediction”. Then, the “sentiment changing”. Look man, they’re bigger than *you and **they’ll protect *their (new) investment -not yours. You’re just *talk, they’re for *real -whether the truck rolled down the hill or not...(we talked about this!) -Start gettin’ ready, it *really ain’t gonna be pretty for *you. They’ll be fine -the *real players will be fine -and they don’t care if *you think this is a “scam”, you think that while they deposit *your money. And I will too -I, and the “buyers” here simply represent the small fish that’ll be hitching a ride on the whale you don’t see coming...Good luck!"
Stop listening to those short sellers. Make up your own mind !
"Nikola (NKLA) continues to fall out of favor among investors. The company, which was once seen as a leader in green energy transportation, is now struggling to remain relevant."
"Lol william you seem not to understand when an equity goes down week after week, month after month, quarter after quarter the short/put position pays off.... NKLA investors purposely lie and try and mislead because they are desperate much like the company."
Glad I bought the dip at 11.20 smh
I am holding this worth of £50k with avg of 14.46..not selling anything bellow $19.i can hold and wait not an issue
Don't wait to buy $NKLA buy now and wait!
"Probably the real reason the head of fuel cell development quit is because he wanted to get out before Apr 30th when all the other staff can sell their shares. He knows it will tank so this way he can sell his before they can. This stock is so, so bad. Just bad news over and over again."
Like I said yesterday ... $NGA MarketCap is so damn undervalue in comparison of $ARVL 8B $Rivain 55B $NKLA 3.5B. Don't be suprise that Monday we have big announce of USA new Plant
Trevor just released images of his new project. A moon lander for himself and the Nikola team.
"So trevor milton the C o n man tricked,lied and deceived investors making off with Hundreds of Millions of dollars and the SEC turns a blind eye???? It shows that corruption sure pays off.........."
Come on single digit
"Fear was driving NKLA down, The sky looks blue in Arizona and Germany. German Engineers are confident in this technology."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umYsaw_Zoig&ab_channel=ExpovistaTV
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Stocks-tracker.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. NKLA exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
"Badgers, we don’t need no stinking Badgers."
close to $10 - wasn't the SPAC's IPO price $10?
I wouldn’t be sleeping being invested in this 
"this is a good $5 stock , soon !"
Shorts lose money. Smart longs always make money. This stock has been a real winner thanks to the ups and downs and now very long position it will help put my kid thru any college.
pretty disappointing volume here... let's hope some big buy orders come in soon.
I draw a new truck on a piece of paper. It is worth 4 billion like nikola
All those shorts here... Some are the same I discussed with about Hertz. People still trying to bash this stock with almost 1 y/o news. It's a fact that this company had a lot of trouble. Was never a scam but the former founder over promised and couldn't deliver. Therefore it's not automatically a scam especially not after almost one year and new management. I am extremely bullish on this right know.
Even Elon is in agreement with this one.
Could it be that the shorts have gotten all their going to get here? Risk vs reward is against them at this point. Not worth trying to get another 50 cents
today 14$?
This company is being pumped by market manipulators! This is the same tactic used when the company was under the direction of Trevor Holmes! It was criminal how CNBC continued to pump this stock throughout the outlandish waves of fraud.
This scam is still going on ? LoL
"The SEC, is looking into the use ofIPO monies; David Randal, a reporterfor Wall Street News Blog told Matt Lohr,the foregoing information."
Bought the dip

The 6 Best Stem Cell Stocks To Buy Right Now For details https://youtu.be/xZZEi-kNwV0
The company that let a truck drive off the hill to pretend it's actually a real truck 
"Nikola will eventually fail. It's just too costly to build trucks or vehicles of any kind as a startup. For example, with the exception of Tesla, there have been no one to challenge the big autos in the US for a 100 years. Tesla was able to succeed only because in the beginning NOBODY took EVs seriously. And before they knew it, Tesla had already established a stronghold. The truth is, Nikola is not taking anyone by storm. The established truck/engine makers (ie. Cummins, Daimler Trucks, Hino, International Trucks, PACCAR, Volvo Trucks...) are ALL already investing heavily in developing hydrogen trucks. They have enormous resources and their own REAL technology. They can take huge losses with their hydrogen trucks, as their profitable ICE trucks compensate."
time to double down
Under $12!
Let the short squeeze begin for upward rise to over $15 by the end of this month! GLTA longs!

"Another great deal - load up! This is going back to $80+ any day now. (The SEC is not going to charge anyone with fraud, (they only go after people who steal from the rich.))"
"Wow, an agreement to build 2 while fueling stations. That’s worth a trillion. Lol. Then it’s gonna take 2 years to build it???? Send in my people, get it done in 2 weeks."
"nkla is 4$ stock, still way over priced!!"
Remember when I said this will reach $14 lmao here we are baby!!!!! Sorry longs
"—If you don’t understand why people “buy this”, you don’t understand human behavior. And “this” has *real value. Now contrast: “Alt coins”. And “behavior” shows they buy and sustain “that”/and there’s zero actual value there... -so what’s to “understand“? -this will go up 1)- because of human behavior, and 2)- because it has the possibility and potential of going up due therefore to “value”/assets/perception(s)/possibilities of real growth. So, that’s two things, and you’ll lose under both of them if you’re short -now/-at this point. Watch and learn. -Good luck."
When does the bleeding stop?
"$PLUG, $FCEL, $BLDP, $BE, $NKLA, etc.Is this time very different than the last 20+ years? Are the companies focused on hydrogen going to make it big financially or drift back to obscurity similar to the last 20 years? Anyone has some well thought out thesis or perspective about the realistic future economics of these companies ???"
"Stock price will depand on one rating? This is big time manupulatation to lower stock price insane,than buy at the lowest point milions of shares and then suddenly upgrade stock price 100% higher. This is the way they make milions of dollars in one day."
Even a cut to $13 means a 15% increase at today price.
I wish I never bought this stock... 40% loss :(
the ONLY reason this stock was not $15 today is because market overall has been bouncing all over down

Breaking News: NIKOLA experimenting new low clearance system for its trucks:
"Nikola Apple Tesla my friends, don't know about history? Well it is not written yet :P"
sell sell I guess today closed 10dollar bellows
Red closing. $10 is coming. Still holding my short position
"Longs, accept it, you have been had."
Before buying Watch this about the former CEO https://youtu.be/1oqqnkkTKVM
Nikola stock will be coasting from now on.
Maybe 3usd buy
BREAKINGGoldman analyst email exposed nikola is beaten down over their estimates
Give this time one to two years.
so glad i reloaded in the 10s... this has that january cover feeling all over again... we could realistically see 20/30% days this week.
Well it was a good day until Dementia Joe crashed the markets.
short interest us huge on this stock.... this might be the new gme
If close today under $10 than by Friday $8
that offering makes no sense. you only make an offering after good news or recent SP raise. An offering on a declining stock shows signs of desperation. 100m is not a lot in terms of total valuation and their supposed cash on hand so why even do it? Not a good sign. I wouldn't be surprise if this stock ends up at less than 10 buck EoY the way the PR is going.
What a joke this company. Cant believe people still really want to hold this stock. Might as well flush your hard earned money down the toilet.
"Buy on dip, next qtr will hit$30!!"
Nikola: #BagholderLivesMatter #BLM
Hold this for at least a decade. You will be rewarded
What's that? That's Hyliion. Class 8 EV powertrain company that makes sense.
Sold 922 shares at 24. Now own 1060 at 11.87. Lol. You all should have listened to me. I'm only mad that I didnt sell at 30
"Please stop posting negative comments, investment is a chance we take, scam or not, good luck or not, bad management or not, if anyone is dissatisfied with their shares, sell them, if anyone believes in Nikola, keep the shares, hope for the best and wait for the worst, in this way you will not be disappointed when things go wrong, I lost about 29% I’m not crying and I’m not selling.Best regards and good luck. Dennis Rasmussen."
"Still waiting for someone to out Elon, Elon."
i would suggest everyone to sell NKLA .. this stock will go bust.
congrats to all long over here  a new year low have been hit. Don't give up! we can achieve so much more like reaching our all time low goal 
SELL SELL SELL i sold my shares and started shorting it i’m finally making money !
Pump it! Louder~!
When do they have any business updates? Or did they turned the lights offffffff
"Dr Faucci, will have CDC put Trevor Milton injail if SEC, does nothing."
Grate day fir NKLA today $15 soon 50 after that
Margin calls! Bwahahaha!
"Breaking news: Marvel shows interest in the Nikola space program to Mars, first spy pics leaked:"
Downgrades will be piling in from analysts the coming weeks! Nogola will be under $1 by the time all is said and done............
"I never thought I would see the day when a ""company"" has its employees coming onto a yahoo finance forum trying to pump a fraud dumpster fire and mislead people. NKLA really takes the cake when it comes to being garbage."
Everyone is worried about NKLA losing a key member of the team.... At least they still have Trevors brother who did home repairs and concrete leading up the advanced technology department... Lmao
"dang sold 200k shares 2 days ago.... oh well, had margin call."
Another big announcement soon
"Some things to keep in mind:A lot of people unfortunately don't know all these details so they wonder why their ""investment"" keeps falling. I will help fill in the blanks because I honestly feel sorry for a lot of you that are new to ""investing"".NKLA = Started by a guy that has multiple lawsuits against him for starting and selling businesses using misleading information.NKLA = They chose the name in order to get people that thought they missed the boat on investing in Tesla. The deception started right from the beginning sadly.NKLA = The company that had to admit that their big tech reveal never existed and instead they pushed a truck with no engine down a slanted hill... This is why we make the jokes about gravity on this sub.NKLA = The founder and others got forced out because of misleading the media and investors and first ghosted on all social media and then deleted all social media.NKLA = Came out as a company and agreed they mislead people.NKLA = The company was stacked with the founders friend and family who had no experience or expertise in hydrogen. The literal brother of the founder was put in charge of the hydrogen development part of the business despite doing basic home repairs and laying concrete his whole life.... It is why we make the jokes about concrete on this sub....NKLA = Many times offered literal cash and free stock to companies like GM and others. None of these companies accepted because the cost of doing business with a fraudulent company was not worth it. Additionally most companies have came out and said NKLA has nothing to offer regardless. At this point they are spending your shareholder money doing back yard amateur projects. If you believe in the EV market or even more precisely hydrogen there are a lot of places doing actual research and work and not just blowing shareholder money to pay their inflated salaries.NKLA = Has investigations by both the SEC and DOJ. That means Security Exchange Commission and Department of Justice...NKLA = Numerous class action lawsuits for misleading investors and mis-spending shareholder money.The list literally goes on for pages but I have kept it semi concise to help a lot of you out. This company is literally going to bankruptcy or delisting. Every major analyst and firm has stated this. No one wants to touch this company with a 10 foot poll due to the stains of corruption and fraud. It is a literal meme on the internet of one of the worst stocks in a decade and a complete fraud."
"Earnings , but most important guidance is the key in coming weeks ...three months price target $16.00"
Now the fire sale by Milton makes sense. He should be investigated for insider trading. He surely should have known about the departure of of the former head of the fuel-cell development program.This company is another Enron.
Nah it would go upto 25 any day - my friend work as a engineer for this company ! They have lots of trucks ready to roll on road!
Shorts are......
"Nikola President Mark Russell and Milton unveiled the never-before-seen Nikola Tre with its clean, contemporary design. “With a range between 500 and 750 miles depending upon load, this gorgeous vehicle will have fast hydrogen fueling in under 15 minutes, even in Europe,” said Russell. “Think about Europe with no more diesel trucks,” said Milton. “The roads will be clean, quiet and beautiful.”"
I love the way the shorts disappear on a rare good day 
Unfortunately this kind of business is very sketchy because of build on thin air.Im glad I got out of this.
Like I said heading to 5 people .
$GSAT next ticker
Alright serious question... Do we have any worse companies on the market right now than NKLA? It has literally become a meme for how much of a fraud this company is and I am just wondering if any known equities are worse at this point or if NKLA has the top spot as the worst equity on the market?
Nkla still in the game ..I let nio go @$2.50
"Instead of Nikola, they should have named themselves Alva. He was a true schemer and businessman first who destroyed Nikola the dreamer. You don't get ahead by getting caught cheating and lying; the best companies are built by getting away with it."
Obvious BAD news on the way people. Buy at 4.
nkla going under 10
"Hello every one, PLEASE get NKLA now and invest your money to Dogecoin (DOGE) That the one-way to get back your lost."
"minor selling pressure, it is not bad so far, wait for the weeks to come, then the floor comes tumbling down."
"Shares of Nikola up nicely pre-market. For all the doubters, this is proof Nikola is indeed about to introduce a fully semi-truck line of BEV and hydrogen trucks. Per JP Morgan, Nikola's trucks will soon be commissioned. Once the trucks are commissioned, Nikola can finalize the hydrogen network. Speed up production. Set up some dealerships. Finalize the deal with Anheuser-Busch and other customers. And Nikola's shares going to the Moon!!! Does anyone know exactly when the semi-trucks go on sale? Or when pre-production model will be ready? Thanks"
Man!!! How is everyone doing on this board? Will this rver recover? Will this rver get squeezed? Where is NKLA on production? Sales?
nikola will some day own tesla
"Nikolili let’s go bakruptlili , the ultimate T - Rash"
"PARTY IS OVER, NEW ALL TIME LOWS COMING"
"Remember about 2 months ago when this stock was around 25? I Said that if the 40 years of being in the game I thought it was time to bail out and save you families money because this was absolutely heading and spiraling down and eventually will crash to zero, I have not been on this site in 2 months and today I took a peek and I see it's exactly where I predicted at 10 !! oh my God I tried to really give good advice to get out and hopefully there was some who listened hopefully most who listened because I truly did it for the compassion for your families and hate to see everybody get financially crushed on a bad investment which this just happens to be. I'm neither lonely or short in fact I have no interest at all in the stock but just being in the game over 40 years I could see the writing on the ball 2 months ago and feel bad that it happened! I wish you all the best of luck and hope for a miracle for you guys still in it but after saying such a precipitous drop do not put any more money into this that's only throwing good after bad ! Good luck if you're going to stick it out."
Anyone not buying with both hands today at these levels will regret not when we´re at 25 in a couple of weeks.
"Strong Buy, good news next month and this will skyrocket."
"bla bla company will make nkla windows who care , that dont gonna push the company value .we need to see some production selling truck otherwise nkla will sink"
"Nikolas new deal with Rig360 sounds very similar to my deal with AAA, Chevron, and Big O tire. I just have access to thousands more locations."
this is actually 1dollar stock time to sell I guess tomorrow hit the 3dollar bellows
Trevor Milton bailed out over a month ago.What we are reading here today is actually old news.He bailed out when SP was around 20$.This should be a great buying opportunity
Lets enjoy today...tomorrow is going to be -10%
HYLN is the good choice!
"The board is identical to NIO in it's upstart. Price and financing is similar too(just not Gov funded; US big business and market manipulators govern our markets). I don't care if It's $4, 8, 12,16, 26. When production and sales start none of this rhetoric will matter. These are manipulated prices. This is an opportunity for 1000% gains on any amount listed above."
Yes I managed to pick up 10s!
"Breaking news: Nikola changes the 'Earnings release"" announcement into ""Burnings release"" announcement"
When this fall it falls couple dollars but when it go up one 40 cents ?!?! Whyyyyyyyyyyyy

"Every day there’s another bad news for this company, it’s a sign of going bankruptcy"
Wow  93 high r u kidding me?Who’s burned and holding the bag? Omg 
Brick by brick. This is a long term investment folks
Single digit by May
Take the pop and sell the news. Remember end of May puts are at $7.50 on this company! Najarian talks about it all the time. Have to be very cautious and patient here or you can get caught with the bag.

Running out of momentum @$12 today. Buy on the coming dip.
Big thanks to all the executives for putting that great presentation video. After weeks of waiting for things to turn around they release statement about performamnce bonuses now? Pretty good timing if it was intended to kill rebound. This could have been done in few weeks or months.
INO - Large or short float than us starting to squeeze
I just bought more shares
Bull trap
So these new shares are only exercisable at $55 stock price in the next 36 months? Is that what I am reading? Why has the stock been going up 6+% daily for the past few days?
Diet Nikola is sugar free and contains no profits. Buy one get none free. What a dog.
it looks like eventually NIKOLA will produce his first truck
"Hopefully the deal with TravelCenters will become true and last long, not like the he deals with GM and others."

Trevor retired on all of your cash...biggest American Greed scam ever

"Form 4s keep lining up from mid twenties till newest last week.. stay positive . Been trading for over 20 years and I’ve seen a lot of things in my time.. spacs I was scriptable till I learned more slowly about them and saw many go this way. Honestly I would be concerned only if this was trading high volumes and had many posters and pumpers etc.. fortunately I seem to have caught this one just before the REAL run. Even the downside from here is MINIMAL AND on top of that the OS and market cap are low not to mention the price to earnings multiple.. we are coming up to the time so. Stay strong and don’t miss out.. price is a steal down here and I hope the merger doesn’t close till early q2 so I can acquire more on the discount given. I’m a swing trader and long trader and I want to see this one out as I see the infrastructure bill close and the set up of this spac as very attractive. Good luck all and have a great weekend! $clii, $fsr $dkng $nkla $cciv $nio $xpev $tsla"
i am rich thanxx
"Don’t forget that they’re going to issue another share purchase program. When that happens, stock is going to sink one more time before going back up. Be careful with your trades, this can be announced any day now cause they need funding so badly!I still say we break $10 one more time before we rocket higher at the end of the year. Now a shorty, I’m long, but I’m also not backing up the truck until we break $10 one more time.Just a rational piece of advice...take it or table it!"
PLUG+Nikola = Tesla of Hydrogen
NKLA share price will fall
"Weight, real weight which is hard to get being offered on both june and july. I would take all those upside calls for a possible short squeeze if I was not so heavy in rtp, and tbiosomebody's lucky daysome lucky robinhooder"

the only way to stop shorts is to buy every change you get on the way down. started at 11.70 and I will buy every single dollar on the way down until they pump this again. Then they gonna pay up.
"""TravelCenters of America (TA) and Nikola Energy, the startup's energy unit, plan to install hydrogen refueling stations for heavy-duty trucks at two sites in California. The sites are expected to be up and running by the first quarter of 2023.""Two???? Lololol!.....to the moon!"
