Do not think a judge would rule against his own state.

One hundred and fifty very bullish
Bring on 180
Why isn't there an article yet with levaquin how it causes heart problems Johnson Johnson discontinued months back that was a warning by FDA did Johnson and Johnson know it was doing that before they discontinued
Stock is stuck in this range. Any chance we see $145 or do we head to $130?
Knee-jerk reaction to efficacy comparison. Key is it protects 100% against hospitalizations. Cant beat the convenience of one shot refrigerator storability convenience. Should recover in short order. Besides vaccine is not meant to be money maker for JNJ.
Today is the overreaction of all overreactions. Money managers that had short positions are simply piling on. They will be buying by the EOD.
"BEVERLY, Mass., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioVie Inc. (BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that it has achieved 50% enrollment of the patients in its open-label Phase 2a clinical study of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin) for treating refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis.Penny Markham, PhD, BioVie Chief Scientist, stated, “The patients we are targeting for BIV201 therapy are desperately ill and experience a miserable quality of life. Absent liver transplantation, their outcomes are very poor. We are pleased to be working on developing a novel drug candidate that could potentially improve their future.”BioVie is conducting a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical trial of its Orphan Drug candidate, BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has FDA Fast Track status and US patent protection. This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. The initial disease target for BIV201 therapy is ascites, which is a serious complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. The FDA has never approved a drug specifically for treating ascites. The active agent in BIV201, terlipressin, is approved for use in about 40 countries for the treatment of related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis but is not available in the US or Japan.Undervalued at $0.03 per share."
JNJ quarterly earnings beat 4 Qtrs in a row; perhaps more. I only check the last 4 qtrs. Forward PE is 15.x per Yahoo Finance. JNJ is a solid buy and hold IMO.
Headed to 80. No doubt
As they say timing is everything. Dividend payout just one day early this time.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) upgraded to Overweight with a $173 (21% upside) price target at Barclays.
Join BNTX tomorrow and get your $$ back. You won’t have to worry about safety.. they just got approved to use the vaccine on teenagers.
Didn't the FDA approve this drug?They should bear some of the blame.
Did you guys just hear that?
"When will JNJ have a 2 for 1 stock split? If the SP keeps going up, I hope they decide to do the split"
Avoid stocks with weak forward revenue and earnings growth.....TXMD 
"We need new management starting with the CEO. And right now this stock isn't going anywhere. For those of you who invest in this stock for the dividend, congratulations. You're the sheep that Gorsky wants to invest in his company., Me, I like stock appreciation and Gorsky certainly hasn't done that. My broker gives me the same spiel that the dividend is wonderful but that's BS to me. I've held this stock since 93 and it should be way higher!"
Value is posting again. That's a good sign for longs.
$160 cometh on COVID-19 vaccine.
"Well, I'm not going to be fooled that these prices deserve a company that's about to change or save the world with its vaccine."
"There is a big risk owning JNJ. We may see another 10% shave day.It is not done and if you look at March/May of this year, JNJ dripped to $118.This is more bad news, bad Q4 and losing Zytiga drug too."
"Seems like a good gamble to buy before the verdict. If it goes in J&J's favor, got to expect a 5%+ bounce. If it doesn't, but ruling soft still goes up. If negative ruling, short term bounce followed by a lot of noise out of highly paid JnJ lawyers, and a long, slow appeal. IMHO"
going to tank hard

"Split. Don't split. It doesn't matter. Value is value. JNJ is loaded with value and in my opinion, is a long term gem."
made not even 25% in the last 5 years when other stocks skyrocketed
"$JNJ posted improved earnings in 3Q16, helped by higher sales compared to 3Q15. Net earnings were $4.27Bil or $1.53 per diluted share compared to $3.36Bil or $1.20 per diluted share last year."
"JNJ & PFE both looking to increase revenue going forward, both on their conf. calls stated they need to increase revenue as both fell short. HELLO is anyone out there, BMY ( Bristol Myers ) is for sale. By the way Bristol on their conf. call stated out right that their own EPS & Revenue will increase for 2017. Hmmm, need we say more..."

Buying dips yup!
Buy JNJ and ABT dips here is phi betta kappa move
"I can't understand why all these posts are about vaccine effectiveness, and not about the actual stock since the vaccine has already been approved. It's clear that JNJ will start distributing it all over the world and make profits out of it, which will influence the value of this stock."
"Dunno but with all the negative news with Johnson& Johnson again,now with baby powder!? they were a trusted brand, what is up with them?? think with these problems,surprised stock is still 128. should be just $20. Yeesh!"
I told you to sell last week folks! Should have listened!
Very strong. 150 is at stone's throw.
$VYST moving next
Buy Buy Buy! JNJ raised forecast but the stock did nothing today. Analysts will give bunch of upgrades tomorrow or next week. 160 here we go!!!!!
Retest of cow's baby shampoo shows absence of formaldehyde:Johnson&Johnson. This is a report that can be found on the Google site this morning.10th June 2019.
i think my coffee is killing me and buying more jnj
Anyone care to explain the option activity today specifically the 130 puts expiring today that were trading as high as 0.98 and for most of the day were trading close to 0.40 when the stock was well over 132. Makes no sense at all.
One shot and no need to refrigerate at an extremely cold temperature and this stock goes down in pre market???
Market up but JNJ down. Looks like Gorsky decided to show up for work today!
"Soon reuters news would say milk, cereals have talc too."

Johnson & Johnson reached an all time high at 156.55
JNJ will go up eventually. But we are going to be under this overhang for a while it seems. JNJ has had these periods before. It always comes out stronger. Hold on to your shares. Let your dividends buy more shares. Buy more if possible. Be patient.
"iOpioid epidemic: New Jersey sues Johnson & Johnson subsidiary over deceptive marketingTHIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM THIS ARTICLE Lindy Washburn, North Jersey Record Published 3:13 p.m. ET Nov. 13, 2018 | Updated 12:14 a.m. ET Nov. 14, 2018Of particular concern was the company's focus on expanding its market share by targeting the elderly and people who had not used opioids before, the lawsuit said. It did this through sham organizations like the ""Let's Talk Pain"" Coalition and websites such as ""PrescribeResponsibly.com"" that conceal the company's role, the lawsuit claimed. Its pamphlets falsely debunked so-called opioid myths by saying ""many studies show that opioids are rarely addictive when properly used for the management of chronic pain."" These claims had no scientific evidence to back them up, said Paul R. Rodriguez, acting director of the Division of Consumer Affairs. Four out of five heroin addicts started with prescription painkillers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. New Jersey has had 2,690 deaths from opioid overdoses this year, as of Nov. 4, according to statistics kept by the Attorney General's Office. That already is 90 more deaths than in all of last year."
Believe me yet?
The new FDA approved Spravato antidepressant drug will rapidly become be a billion dollar grossing drug.
Jnj strong sell.
Its a beat: earnings per share of $1.67 on revenue of $18.34B vs expected: EPS of $1.47 on revenue of $17.5B.
Ready to load up at 100$...
"U.S orders another 200,000,000 doses from Moderna and Pfizer - doesn't sound like we are waiting for JNJ."
lol wow i am stunned 500 million is literally nothing for JnJ
Does the trade war effect JNJ stock?
JNJ is going to run to new high next week. will pop after earning.
JNJ has very good pipeline of new drugs. It’s a good time to add/buy shares here.
"For the last several years I kept looking at JNJ for a dividend investment to diversify my portfolio into that sector. I thought the price was high when it was near 100. Well, now that it has dropped from 148 to today's 129, maybe I will keep an eye on it, if the price drops some more. Similar to when I bought into BP after the Gulf Oil disaster. BP recovered, still pays dividend, etc"
Headed to $140+ tomorrow. You can still buy it after hours and make money tomorrow. Congrats to all who added below $130
"Deborah I muted Valueless, you should too. I'm long term, this will blow over too."
$^IXIC conversations Posters are worse than coronavirus. Has anyone found a cure for $^IXIC?
This thing does not like 129
120 and below is where you will do very well - they even make Tylenol
"Clarence20 hours agoAshley can't help proving he is a troll, Overall market is tanking and he wants recognition of his wonderful short....BAaaaaaaaa"
JNJ will be the leader on vaccines................They will out supply any other Company.
Tomorrow the market will be down 300 and we will be up .25 lol 
JNJ is looking good today. Could it be people are realizing no definitive proof exists to back the claims of those looking for a big payday at the expense of one of the premier companies in America? It may take a while thanks to ambulance chasing lawyers and their slip and fall clients but in the end JNJ will win out. Keep collecting those dividends and adding to your accounts via DRIPs.TIA
ouch
"3 minutes ago and another story from a lab, that they did find asbestos in the talc."
"I see JNJ is involved with operation smile. We all know certain drugs help cause cleft lip. I keep getting solicitations from Smile train to help pay for Cleft Lip Victims. I wish Smile train would do background information on the parents, to see what drugs they were taking. I wish Smile Train would require parental disclosure of drugs taken. And I wish US doctors would ask fro parental drug use, whenever they repair a US cleft lip. We have to make the drug companies, that are making billions and billions, responsible for the harm they do."
JNJ would jump $20 per share if they would announce that they will stop selling baby powder.￼￼
We are now above the 50 Day Moving Average and Ready for Lift Off Houston.
folks isn't j&j giving away the vaccine basically for free? check out one of its suppliers who will be making the vaccine for profit e b s I think that's going to be the real winner here go for it I just bought some the other day.
"I don't know why there are so many people with negative views on this stock. Sure it is not gaining this much lately, but overvalued? P/E ratio of 23 and forwarding 16 is UNDERVALUED in healthcare! It would be bouncing around 147 and 155 for awhile. It is impossible to go down to 120. In fact, it would have a higher possibility of going towards 160."
This’ll skyrocket on Monday. They just got approved by the FDA
Johnson is down. It needs some stimulation.
Go ahead and dip. Divys being paid out soon. I’ll take the discount
"lol, isnt this supposed to be one of those ""safe stocks"" that you buy during a downturn"
This will not end well. J&J will get sued left and right by everyone (and their mother). Let go. There is only pain here now. Just sell and move on.
An important note that is suspected with this vaccine.. they suspect that at 4-6 months it will be closer to 90-95% of the other vaccines... This study really only had the capability to look at the 2-4 month benefit.I didn't own JNJ until this morning... I believe the news is a lot better than what the top line % implies. I would rather get one shot than two!
"Nov. 25 2016J&J confirms it is in talks to buy Swiss biotech Actelion.J&J and Actelion have made it official. The pharma giant is involved in talks to acquire the Swiss biotech, which had a market cap of $16.4 billion, before word of the buyout talks first surfaced in Bloomberg.“There can be no assurance any transaction will result from these discussions,” notes J&J $JNJ , which could easily require a 50% premium to complete a deal like this.CEO Jean-Paul Clozel, who split away from Roche to establish the company, a specialist in pulmonary arterial hypertension, has spent years pooh-poohing talks about a potential buyout. But Actelion (SIX: ATLN) has also been a constantly cited takeover target for the likes of J&J and Sanofi, which would be attracted by rising sales for new products Opsumit and Uptravi, which have come online as Tracleer revenue has begun to fade.“We at Actelion–the board of directors, the management, the employees–are all building a company and not thinking about being sold the next day,” Clozel told Bloomberg back in the spring. “If we want to continue to create shareholder value, the best for us is to remain independent.”J&J management, which has its own reasons for paying top dollar for the company, may persuade him otherwise."
"The past three times JNJ announced a split, it was done concurrently when it raised its dividend:4/23/92, 4/25/96 & 4/26/01.Presumably we can put the ""split posts"" to rest for another eleven months."
$147 tomorrow
The $4.5 billion award was an insane amount of money for 22 plaintiffs. That better be reversed or cut by 95% if there is justice. I think this whole thing is ridiculous. Why would JNJ intentionally harm people. I don't believe talc is a dangerous product. I don't think a trace amount of asbestos could cause cancer and nobody can prove it was the cause of their cancer.
if they want more ppl vaccinated a 1 shot vaccine makes way more sense. they go once and don't have to think about it again
JNJ just became a $400B+ market cap stock. The first time in it's illustrious history. Congradulations to a great company and to it's long term shareholders that have always believed in the core values of this company and the Credo that it has stood by for over 100 years.
"JNJ flirting seriously with imminent buyout of USRM-OTC . . . under a buck a share, but not by much. Word on the street is serious talks are progressing and the stem cell leader will NOT accept a low-ball offer. On good authority!"

"VXRT $3 so what!!! this is a pill form vaccine compared to an injection and all the considerations with getting an injection; bulk, storage temperature, skill, distribution, infection. a pill is easily distributed and taken. if someone had to make a wish list for what a vaccine needs to have vxrt has it. plus we are waiting on results from a universal flu vaccine study with our jnj janssen partner. wouldnt it be great to deliver two pills to everyone in the world. vxrt has all ready done a study showing their method is better than the leading injectible. the world governments should be throwing money at vxrt. this is the real deal. speed it up, save the people. it's time our share price reflected this. $30 plus!!!"
JNJ dump sell inferior vaccines to disturb market. Our Americans don’t need junk JNJ vaccines. We have enough Pfizer and Moderna excellent vaccines for all Americans people.
The shorts are jumping ship while us longs sit back and enjoy a drink..I'll be buying on the next dip.
Bad newwwwws!!!
nice move in jnj.i would rather take their vaccine 66 percent effective over phizer that is 96 percent effective.right
"ZurichBob, you are very quiet this evening. Don't you get paid for working on Fridays in Mumbai or is it Delhi ?"

"OK attorneys stated that JNJ convinced doctors that addiction was not a concern and that more use of opioids would solve the problem so just increase the dose. That's the claim they used as JNJ marketing tool. I call BS. Just because a company makes a product doesn't mean they are liable for a person addiction. Many addicts do whatever is needed to get their drug of choice whether it be drugs (legal or illegal) food, alcohol, cigarettes etc. I can't imagine this holding up in an appeal court."

"The growing debt levels don't help. JNJ ended September with net debt of ~$14 billion. The company is unlikely to load up on more debt due to the talcum powder lawsuits. The key investor takeaway is that either the company doesn't see the stock as cheap now or the combination of net debt and talc powder lawsuits has JNJ on the sidelines. Either way, the stock remains far too expensive for the limited growth rates and the risk. Sell JNJ on any of these rallies towards $140.Johnson & Johnson: Paying A Premium For Liability Risk $JNJ https://seekingalpha.com/article/4212256"

JNJ share price will come back from recent dips - good dividend declaration today and earnings on 22nd will be strong as well. Litigation will keep being defended and scientific evidence and years of clear test results are on their side. I don't see evidence for this glorified conspiracy story so that won't amount to anything in court.
coverage initiated and earnings beat forcast so why the big drop today! I don't know.. but am holding.
I thought there was no asbestos found this thing should be UP
How much is par value on JNJ?
I can’t believe that Amazon is still selling carcinogenic JNJ baby powder. Reading some of the reviews and feel really sorry for the 5-Star reviewers who claim to be users for decades. I suggest they visit their oncologists or gynecologists. Hopefully Amazon will wake up and stop selling those harmful products.
where does all these nay sayers come from. Are they people who shorted the stock and want to insight fear. Today the dividend is paid to holders who had the stock on February 22nd the ex dividend date. I will take the money and gladly wait to see Johnson and Johnson become the dominant vaccine worldwide
"Sell now or lose next week! Who wants a subpar vaccine?! There will be plenty of Novavax, MRNA and Pfizer vaccine with efficacy in the 90's. Why would anyone want a 60% effective vaccine? Wake up folks!"

"How does this forum feel about $JNJ? I bought 10 shares in Feb 2018 and have reinvested dividends ever since. However, I’ve only seen 10% gain over that time. I may just sell it altogether. Am I getting out at the wrong time?"
"5 Reasons Imo why you should consider buying PGNX. PGNX already has two drugs approved by the FDA. Imo, PGNX is currently undervalued at $5.25 PS.Relistor which is showing 41% sales increase year-over-year. Should receive 10 million dollar milestone payment soon.Azedra recently approved by the FDA, which is expecting estimated sales of 200 to 300 million dollars plus per year in the US, plus patients coming to the US for treatment. Azedra has been proven to save lives.PyL phase 3 for prostate cancer imaging is expected to start by end of 2018, based on PyL positive trial results, PGNX very optimistic opinion and the FDA fast concurrence & decision to move to phase 3.Data from compassionate use of I-131 1095 indicates it was well tolerated and demonstrated markedly reduced PSA levels and bone pain in a group of heavily-pretreated advanced prostate cancer patients following a single cycle of treatment. “We are pleased, following our discussions with FDA, to move this important therapeutic agent into a phase 2 study in combination with enzalutamide in chemo-naïve patients with mCRPC,” stated Vivien Wong, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Development at Progenics."

This is the second prostate cancer FDA approval. Both are blockbusters.
Why is Yahoo Finance showing JNJ has no dividend?
"How do we know someone who works in the factory didn’t tamper with the product? Anyone could have put something in the product. How to even figure that out? Not saying it happened or backing JNJ, but who really knows"
"What happened to the last 30 mins, there was no trading for JNJ? This is weird."
Clearly there are a lot of people here that don't comprehend basic science and especially statistics. This was a worldwide study unlike Pfiser and Moderna that just did US and did very selective regions so like one strain was covered. This study was global and covered almost all strains seen today even the more aggressive ones in Brazil and South Africa. Plus it's a single shot and is stored at room temperature that alone is incredible.
So let me get this straight a jury of our peers that's normal people like us decide the Johnson & Johnson's baby powder and Talcott cause overian cancer and you guys don't believe people like us but believe in the big giants of a multibillion-dollar drug company is that what I'm getting?
So will J&J get gov money to develop a vaccine?

"Look, even without this latest news, JNJ was significantly overpriced. When the dust settles, Id be a buyer of maybe sub $110. That'd be the only prices that might start intriguing me."
"ALL these politicians should be locked up, using the public as guinea pigs. How on earth are they producing vaccines at such an alarming rate. Everyone and their grandmother is making a vaccine. Some of these conpanies have NEVER, EVER produced a vaccine prior to covid-19. And to make matters worse, from the onset of the outbreak its been about a year, and we have all these vaccines claiming to be ao effective. Usually it takes years to formulate and vette a new medicine, now they are able to do it in a matter of weeks/months.I would suggest we ask our politicians and their families to take rhe vaccines first and let us know how it worked out. So far tbey are all using the excuse that they don't want to jump the line, and that they are giving those in priorty situations the jab first. Note, first Pfizer then Moderna claimed they had a vaccine, one tried to one-up the other with ridiculous claims of efficacy, then , the other said, well ours is good for the south African strain, and the UK strain etc, etc.How can it be good for all strains when you do not know what yu are facing. And if that's the case, then they better get us a vaccine for the flu that actually works and while they are at it producing results so quickly they should get to work on some cure for cancer or atleast a vaccine, since they can solve these things in such short notice. We the public need to ask the right questions and stop being lead like sheeps to the slaughter. How can we trust any of the science when it has not been properly vetted.If this keeps up, I'm putting out my own vaccine!."
"- Adam Feurstein's Tweet from Sept 13""I still believe $JNJ will drop $GERN imetelstat. I guess we wait for later this month to see if I’m right or wrong. Nothing today changes my bearish view. If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative."" https://t.co/UKOlyO799E"
"JNJ better get moving with buyout of GERN, competition just popped its head up read,Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, -0.09% said early Thursday that its Kite unit will partner with privately-held Gadeta B.V. to develop new cancer therapies called gamma delta T cell receptor therapies. Gadeta's proprietary technology in this area, which is a type of cell therapy, may be used to treat blood cancers and solid tumors. Kite will fund the research and development costs and buy equity in Gadeta, with the ""exclusive option"" to acquire Gadeta. Gadeta will also be eligible for milestone payments. Gilead did not disclose financial terms of the deal. Gadeta was founded in 2015 and is based in the Netherlands. Gilead shares slumped 0.5% in premarket trade."
“What day is it today... I’m confused... don’t eat snow.. paper route.. my dementia is kicking in again”
"Seems that hayflick and Walter white have identical opinions, post 3 or 4 full paragraphs when nobody is really listening ri them, and they've posted incessantly since JnJ walked away from their GERN deal, obliterating GERN from 7 bucks to a dollar. Identical stories from the same, angry troll, whining and crying daily, ANYTHING to avoid taking any blame for his own foolishness of over investing in garbage. So now, JNJ is the scapegoat to his stupidity as he creates more screennames."
The human trolls are out today. Of course they were no where to be found yesterday. Just shows how easy it is to be present and absent so quickly in todays behind the keyboard world we live in. GL to all longs. JNJ is a very resilient company.
Same happens to $MRNA. It went up a week later. Hedge fund are dangerous than Reddit. They are playing this game on bio stocks
will test 2014 low soon
Next year JNJ wil increase it's dividend for the 57th straight year.
Merry Christmas to all.May the new year bring you everything you hope for and lots of celberations.

"Back to JNJ being the safe haven. We are set up to go past the 12 month high on to 150s sooner or later. This is the time of the year when winners win more and losers lose more, all because of the tax loss selling."
JNJ.OTC
Good volume
bye bye140.00
"JNJ is firing on all cylinders, with cradle to grave products, now proven efficacy Covid-19 vaccine(s). $180-$190 per share is around the bend."
I know the ex dividend is today. Does anyone know what date you can sell to keep the dividend?
jnj will crumble soon as well
"JnJ vaccine using same Adenovirus vector technology as AstraZeneca which has halted its trial in US due to a severe reaction. The adenovirus is used as a vector to inject live human cells with DNA that then produces Covid 19 proteins for the life of the cell. The question is when will the genetically modified cell turn off. churning out Covid 19 proteins could induce a severe inflammatory response AKA: AstraZeneca causing myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord membrane).Whatever happened to using the tried, proven, and safe method of combining viral proteins with adjuvants to train the immune system to fight off a real infection."
$127 haha
"Shorts scared. CRON with $1,576,000,000,000 in cash they could buy many companies and merge with $TLRY. V shape Recovery. The market will go back to new highs. $JNJ has a vaccine using it on an emergency basis. $ABT has 5-minute testing. That story will be destroyed and on to the next."
I added more to my holdings 2 days ago. I should have added a lot more.
Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Authorized by U.S. FDA For Emergency Use.
"Few points: Emergent Biosolutions (EBS) is the stock that people should be buying on vaccine news from JNJ, Novavax and AstraZeneca. Just like PFE/Biontech partnership real winner will be EBS not the big players. Always do your dd. GL"
Vaccine approved stock down. Ms medicine approved stock not moving. So what does it take for this beast to move at all. Anywhere
A tremendous pipe line.P/E will shrink in out years.
Remember there are almost 8 billion people in this world. Wouldn't get too hung up on how many vaccines are being shipped within the US from all 3 vaccine suppliers. US population is 331 million. Plenty of arms to poke out there.
"J&J is looking into whether cross-contamination of the sample caused a false positive, whether the product was appropriately sealed and maintained in a controlled environment, and whether the product was a counterfeit."
"I'm humored by the emotional JNJ longs: they are questioning the skills / calling for the head of the lab employee(s) that discovered an asbestos tainted sample; it's the SAME lab JNJ has used to REFUTE the presence of asbestos in its baby powder!!!""J&J's own expert, working for FDA, found asbestos in Baby Powder""""In challenging the FDA’s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts.The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J.Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defence against plaintiffs’ claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers.He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company’s argument that its iconic brand is safe."" Sort of a pickle for JNJ."
if the vaccine is the highest in protecting you from death (JNJ) then the “threat” is not getting the virus. The threat is dying from the virus.
Insiders know something which is the reason this has been tanking since last week. Is it perhaps the lawsuits or maybe the vaccine is not working? Small time investors are always at a loss because we do not have the inside track like the big brokerages and banks.
EU approves $JNJ vaccine
i suspect this was some false news designed to create hedge fund desires. Shorts may get hammered if it gaps up 20.00 Monday. Why else would they release this kind of news? Can't think of any other reason.
Buy and hold JNJ if you want to make money.
I think JNJ vaccine has a good chance and a lot of opportunities in the USA and all over the world.This is the only vaccine with the easiest way to go far in remote areas and save people's life.
To those talking about how great it is and congratulating each other for being so smart investing this. I posted this to Steve who bragged about making lots of money here and saying he doesn’t believe the lawsuits “Of course you don’t believe them :) you are paid to look the other way. Your financial interests would be threatened. It’s a the story as old as time why humans have mental justified to themselves participating in all sorts of horrendous acts.From the holocaust to the soviet purges.”
Will we have another Gorsky day?
BMO Price target 181.00 most others are close to 200
"JNJ with the momo, lol, don't see that often.. The catalyst was the courts telling the talc lady you can't blame JNJ, should have known not to put baby powder up your kootchie for years..."
"May.07 -- Paul Stoffels, chief science officer at Johnson & Johnson, discusses the company’s pursuit of a coronavirus vaccine as it prepares to produce hundreds of millions of doses in 2021.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xlFOm6d4A4"
JNJ make not take profit on actual vaccine but they will on all other aspects tied to it. Like construction: underbid then make money on the change orders.

Looking stable on a red day is a good sign for JnJ.
"This drops a little more, I might have to think about opening up the checkbook"
look they even gave us an athritis drug approval to boot
"Perfect time to buy on the dips as we are heading towards interest rate hikes and JnJ is a solid consumer stock where it has pricing power. today's market drops is partially relates to President Trump""s 30% import tariff tax on solar and washing machines plus the last round of NAFTA meeting with Mexico, Canada and U.S.A. Long JNJ. not selling..."
wish BMY and MRK would trade like J&J
I have a feeling JNJ can't get any lower from this poin
Still a stalwart! Love JNJ!
"It is a fact, JNJ tried to strong-arm the CDC official to accept small trace of asbestos in the baby power, to be acceptable: this was done by attempt to force the official to accept increase amount and present of asbestos in baby powder as acceptable and legal.JNJ own internal memo show their baby power is their ""holy grail' product when it come to TRUST.What will customers now think of JNJ when they cheat, lie, deflect legit responsibility when it comes to our CHILDREN? For God-sake, we're talking about BABIES and MOTHERS!Soon you will see the CEO of JNJ on TV claiming that the product is safe, and there is no liability - even after they lost the legal battle. It is very similar to ENRON : they also deflect, deny, lie, and demonize their own employee who expose their scam. You have been warned not to get anywhere close to this stock - just as the ENRON fools who also drove-up their truck and loaded up when the stock was $75/share.Like G. Bush said ""read my lips"" - this JNJ company will go to the DOGS!"
Not another down day pleaseeee
"Personally, I would choose this vaccine over the rest so far just based on its 100% efficacy to keep me out of the hospital! I don’t like MRNA for its “messaging” the cells. I’d rather-have something working with my natural body. Just my 2 cents."
Very clear and robust response to recent talc articles from J&J CEO Alex Gorsky - watch video message from link below.https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6480491001680003072
I sold my jnj and ... ve been buying oil
JNJ will go back up. It it dip more I buy more shares.
All consumer staples are down. Now's the time to accumulate. Put up or shut up.
"stay short.....................130.00""s soon"
First of the month. Another DRIP purchase waiting in the wings.
Note to JNJ: Please do not add asbestos to the coronavirus vaccine
asbestos again?
155 tests through 4 different methods in 2 labs and no asbestos found
"The endpoints for MDGL versus GALT are totally different. MDGL endpoint required that they show reduction in fatty liver tissue which was met in their phase 2 trial. GALT had to show a much more difficult endpoint which was to show a significant change in hvpg which is a measurement of liver blood pressure, which was accomplished in patient without esophageal varices. MDGL will treat patients with early-stage Nash and GALT will treat patients with advanced Nash that has developed into cirrhosis of the liver, therefore they are not competitors. Since Nash has no symptoms until late stage development to cirrhosis of the liver, GALT drug will be more widely used then MDGL. In GALT trials it was proven that there was significant reduction in fibrosis. I believe that GALT could meet the endpoint that MDGL met but I don't believe that MDGL could meet the endpoint that GALT had. Therefore I believe GALT has the better drug. They both have to perform a phase 3 trial. Based on this data, GALT is way under valued."
Diversifying? Bored with pharmaceuticals? I am too!Inseego one of the best work and school from home companies seeing big demand for their products. INSG it's a 5g stock.
This will turn out to be like the aspirin tampering back in the 80s I believe which caused JJ to have tamper proof bottles
RELAX..... I am sure many of you have 401K worth over $100K and your 401K balance also tanked today so did you sell all positions in your 401K?
Charles and jnj is being accused of lying so you're saying the also were lying about the strategic decision you are saying on your post that Johnson & Johnson said that they stepped away from imetelstat because it was bad science. This quote never came from jnj unless you are making false statements. Is this correct? Unless you are lying also.
J&J headed to $140 in November 
"What are most of you doing before the verdict....buying, holding selling? GLTA"
"Bloated, overexposed liability, slow mover, great long term investment "
On CBS nightly news it was stated yesterday the JNJ vaccine was approved and millions of doses were ready to be shipped on Monday. What going on here. The stock is going down and the vaccine additional approval. Is it fake news again?
Still unable to open and hold $150 which is very surprising to me. I do. It understand why people are selling here. I bought shares at $137 and $139 and added earlier this week at $144. I am puzzled by the poor performance.
over due to bust out
"FIFO re tax ""reform"" has been pulled.This is good news for long term equity investors that have made more than one purchase of an issue, or for those who have been reinvesting dividends (and might sell shares in the future).For those who have losses, you will continue to be able to cherry pick the proper lot to sell for the largest loss."
JNJ should discontinue selling baby powder it is not worth it ! let users buy it from CHINA!

Serves them right. Hope it drops another 15 on Monday. Screw JnJ
Tell me how much asbestos was found in our drinking water pipelines!!! Most likely more then talic. Let’s sue the cities !!!!!
"JNJ is getting hit with a lot of short term negative sentiment. I firmly believe that this will all pass in a few weeks and we will be near the old highs by the next ER. For the long-timers, if this is not a buying opportunity I don't know what is. GL all."
I wonder if insiders sold after they were pumping how great their vaccine was yet it was substandard...not fair to those of us who bought their hype which was not accurate. Boolean
By selling the vaccine at cost and supplying it to countries all over the world ... JNJ will reap untold karma and positivity .... which will surely result in share appreciation .
"Ok. So don't buy the baby shampoo. Who cares! Hardly makes any contribution to bottomline anyway.NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's baby shampoo samples failed quality tests conducted by the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, according to a public notice from the state's drugs watchdog, findings that were rejected by the U.S. drugmaker"
Nervous holding your long position? You should be.

"Cancer news...Lawyers had been soliciting on TV for I'd guess 6 months, then stopped a month or so agoSo this can't truly be ""news"" to anyone owning JNJ including me.Lawyers aren't ""advocates"", they are money hounds. And they see JNJ as having deep pockets.If another case or two is won and not appealed the TV commercials will start again.BTW similar thing going on with Roundup weed killer now. ONE person won a big settlement and the Lawyers are on TV not looking for people they ""care about"" but folks to make a percentage on.Lawyers - well I have many thoughts on them, none really flattering. But it's OUR system.If you pay attention you can make money on these situations.And at this time of Year with tax loss selling and the market, Tarif's, etc. it will cause JNJ to move with a higher Beta than normal downward.I'd love to pickup more JNJ but price is still way above all of my cost basis's.I still may buy some JNJ or calls for first quarter of next Year depending on how bad the premium is. And if the premium is high I may buy/write to lock in some decent return on those shares. After all if JNJ goes up significantly I'll benefit with all the shares that I currently hold.Tricky market.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!"

Jnj just got approval
imo strong sell
JNJ was a standout and a safe stock in the middle of this stock selloff. This Zytiga news now throws a monkey wrench into this. We will have wait and see how this shapes up over the next few weeks. I am sure JNJ's legal team and Government relations machinery has a few tricks up its sleeves. If you are in it for the long haul you will be okay.
JNJ chart looks alike AZN patterns. The same stall ward type.
It is because the whole market knows that they are sitting on information that should have been disclosed to shareholders long ago.
The following is an interesting twist!:https://uk.news.yahoo.com/exclusive-j-js-own-expert-101552267.html
Bring back clean beautiful asbestos!

"Looks like a steal at these levels, JNJ has such a large pipeline to protect investors"
"yeah, the drug companies are greedy, but these were FDA approved drugs. IMHO the FDA and doctors who prescribed these are most liable. Why didn't the 'state' go on a campaign to warn of the addiction hazards and have the drug manufacturers contribute to that rather than sound the alarm and start suing years after this had become as its been called an 'epidemic'? Answer $$$$ & good publicity for the AG's."

"This is the most fantastic vaccine out there in one dose. It is 20 % more effective than the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines on their first dose and a refrigerator or cool pack is all that is needed in transit. A study is underway using a 2nd dose, but even one will keep you out of hospital 100%."

""The good news about Johnson & Johnson is they've decreased the size of their trial from 60,000 people to 40,000 people. You don't do that unless you're expecting a large effect.""LOOK for the dips here................................"
this could pop 30 bucks dudes and dudettes
major breakout coming
Open P3 enrollment would prohibit $JNJ from listing #Imetelstat for expanded access. #FDA approval would do the same.

"Johnson & Johnson plans to sell the vaccine at cost, at least during the first phase of the pandemic.

It’s unclear what that will mean for the company’s profitability in the short term, if anything, but the reputational gain of producing a successful vaccine candidate may be significant, as it has been for other drugmakers. “How many people knew who Moderna was before now?” And remember, unless you are a politician, you have NO choice what vaccine you will receive."

JNJ is 1 of 2 AAA Companies left and it should easily dictate a 20plus multiple of forward earnings regardless of talc lawsuits so do the math 180-200 will be here next year .
"Just curious....why does JNJ have to advise of the risks? Isn't that the Dr's job. Lord knows my Dr gives me enough #$%$ about smoking. This shouldn't be on JNJ, this should be on the Dr's insurance. And it will be reversed on appeal."
Could someone on the msg board please post the countries where JNJ has been approved ?

"Bought some puts here before the verdict. I think there is way too much downside risk. I think the precedent was set with the tobacco companies and they really want to hit the opioid producers hard. JNJ is the only one that didn't settle. Either way I'm sure it will be appealed, but I see a lot of downside risk with maybe a small upside depending on outcome today at 4. But if it's high billions as a judgment this will tank short term as states line up with their hand out even though today's verdict will be far from the last of these lawsuits. They will cost a lot either way."

If you dont learn from your mistakes, you are destined to repeat them. This is why Wannabe Walter is so bitter...he never learns, and never wins...with investments or in life. So he blasts this board with nonsense gifs, angry posts, and irrelevant politics. What a nightmare it must be to have his life. Sorry, not sorry."

"The Board of Directors and Gorsky need to be replaced. Repeated systemic failures everywhere. In Risperdal (mass fraudulent marketing) resulting in an 8 billion dollar fine and possible a criminal deferral, in Oklahoma it was found by a Republican and Morman Judge (generally conservative) to have pushed Opioids on ""pill mill "" doctors and additionally to have mass marketed Opioids fraudulently which undoubtedly killed people from overdoses, and finally denying their own internal memos that say asbestos is in baby powder, continuing to sell baby powder with asbestos in it. It only pulled it when the FDA confirmed that it contains asbestos. What a bad example of corporate ethics and behavior. This is perhaps the most evil corporation in the history of our country. It is clear that Johnson's management does not care about anything but money. If they kill some drugs addicts or cause boys to grow breast, or kill babies with asbestos powder they don't care as long as they keep their big houses and big bank accounts. Shame on them."
"The government just agreed to buy an additional 100 million doses of JNJ's vaccine. We won't make any money in supplying this drug.........""trust me""? Yeah right."
How many downgrades?
"Its a good idea to require companies to disclose their pricing for drugs.They should also be required to disclose the percent of users who have suffered major side effects, or died.IE 25% of all users develop TB, 10% get kidney problems, 1% die, etc etc.Drug companies are inherently evil. They need exposure to light. Lots of light."

Time for JNJ to fire up the buyback guns.
Honestly I thought for sure IA would be released today ahead of tomorrow's Q3 confrence.
JNJ should buy EXEL.
Overall I think we will see upside for JNJ in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? google awesome-STOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
This stock can't get out of its own way. See continued downward trend
Why is JNJ unloved? I don't understand the price dropping like this!
WILL jnj buy geron????????????
I might start buying at 113 support.
stop the BS...can you imagine size$ of damages if a jury was involved? Other cases may very well be jury trials! Pursue just offered $12B to settle actions! JNJ should assume that amount of $$ if it litigates future suits!

"JNJ was hot until 1Q18 ER. After that it was all downhill. Hopefully now that we are likely close to the bottom, we could see it trend up. The tax reform was a big positive. So was the nice dividend boost and the implied vote of confidence. But it has been weighed down by other negative factors like law suits, strengthening of the dollar etc. Pendulum will have to swing back sooner or later to the other side. Patience will win."
JNJ CLIMB TO RESUME BUT WHEN????
"I noted that my DRIP purchase was made on 03/03/21 at $155:07 or so Camidge stated, but today it shows that my drip stock cost $160:02. Can anyone please explain the difference in price? Thank you in advance for any help"

Slow Poke Johnny. Others are miles away in vaccine and the Rodrigues just saying that will try Phase1/2.
the company will coem out swinging IMO...analyst will say thsi is overblown and they knew about these lawsuits last year...Someone needs to cover a huge short imo and releases this BS
if you ever bother to wonder why SharkBait gets negative reviews it is because he is a fake poster who used to spend time years ago enjoying being rude and spreading stories about how he retired and walked away with tons of options from a silicon valley company. a person that refers to other posters as MF speaks for itself as a fake. now he has toned it down and makes believe that he is a big JNJ shareholder because his spouse worked there. more false facts if the past is an indication
This is continued liquidation in AAA companies which is ridiculous. 1 Year from now you will be regretting selling.
People seem to forget that you will have NO CHOICE on which vaccine you get. If you manage to make an appointment you have absolutely no choice on what vaccine you will be given.

"Boeing makes a big bull run back above $200 in these cases, a cure for CoronaVirus comes out, a big order comes in, the likelihood for the cure is high with $GILD and $INO and $JNJ all working on it."
I think it's time to put an end to all of the ridiculous Oxy settlements aimed at bankrupting JNJ. This is a lesson that there is a value in having large pharmaceutical companies based in the US.
"The correct word to describe GALT is under valued because it is only 2% of the value of MDGL. If both companie's Nash drugs are approved, GALT will outsell MDGL because Nash has no symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage, cirrhosis of the liver. GALT GR-MD-02 Nash drug showed statistical significance in treating patients with cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices and met the objective endpoint in Phase 2B trial. Based on the new right to try law I believe GALT Nash drug can be used to treat patients with esophageal varices, which it showed moderate Improvement in HVPG and significant Improvement in cell ballooning in Phase 2B Trail. I think it's time to buy GALT, before FDA finalized phase 3 trial. DD."
Anaphilaxis in 2 people following the vaccine means J&J's vaccine will require those vaccinated to stay put for at leas an hour's observation and that the facility have stocks of epinephrine on hand to handle side effects. How big a damper will this be on the vaccine?
Will an Ok. judge rule against his own state for $17B??? Good luck J&J. Why was this trial in Ok.??
It will be a small bump perhaps 165 on Monday. It is certainly a game changer because it is a one shot vaccine and with the ease of storage & transportation more poorer countries can benefit from this somehow. Wouldn't be much of a profit from the sale of the vaccine but yea we are buying the jnj reputation. I believe Jnj uses the safer well studied technology to develop its vaccine & not the newer mRna technology. No one knows about the long term side effects of the mrna technology.
"CEO said “in its totality” regarding reports confirming asbestos. If a few states there is in fact, then there is"
235 PE? Are you kidding? They need to allocation $100B to pay for lawsuits.

"Most investors do not know that BIVI is a Nash drug for treating ascites an advanced stage of liver cirrhosis. BIVI has had favorable Phase 2 trial data and has applied for patents in the United States (which was approved), China, and Japan. BIVI has FDA orphan designation and Fast Track designation. Expect top-line results in June/July 2018. It has been manipulated and controlled by short players. Now that the Nash section is heating up I expect this stock to move higher. At $0.04 a share, it is probably the best opportunity in the market today. Buy, hold, and accumulate. DD"
At $127 its a buy
Socialism!!!! Sounds to me like if they want to give away vacine at cost. What about fiduciary obligation to share olders?

"Significant POP from JNJ. The vaccine is 100% effective preventing death and hospitalization during the phase 3 trial, 44.000 people. The 1 dose vaccine will provide invaluable in the fight against the pandemic, with the two dose follow up likely to be long term successor, with out cold storage distribution challenges.... I see Pfizer, is already looking to increase the number of doses per vial due to logistical challenges...."
"Going to green up soon. Wish I could say the same for my lawn, hehe."

"J&J attorneys provided Reuters with hundreds of documents and directly responded to dozens of questions in order to correct misinformation and falsehoods. Notwithstanding this, Reuters repeatedly refused to meet with our representatives to review the facts and refused to incorporate much of the material we provided them.The Reuters article is wrong in three key areas:1. The article ignores that thousands of tests by J&J, regulators, leading independent labs, and academic institutions have repeatedly shown that our talc does not contain asbestos.2. The article ignores that J&J has cooperated fully and openly with the U.S. FDA and other global regulators, providing them with all the information they requested over decades. We have also made our cosmetic talc mines and processed talc available to regulators for testing. Regulators have tested both, and they have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.3. The article ignores that J&J has always used the most advanced testing methods available to confirm that our cosmetic talc does not contain asbestos. Every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free."

"JNJ vaccine 100% effective in reducing hospitalizations and death 28 days after getting their one shot vaccine is the real game changer. And that their trial included the variants. People may still get infected but infection rate was reduced as well as the overall severity.I think all these vaccines coming out, and especially JNJs vaccine, are going to save the whole world economies. Travel and leisure and restaurants will benefit greatly and bounce back in no time. With proof of a vaccination, the cruise lines will be sailing again in no time since the elderly will be first to receive them, and theyre the primary customers."

3 Insider Buys on JNJ on 12/14. All by directors. I just saw the news
Who here would buy this company if there was no dividend? EXACTLY. NO ONE. LOL. Rates are better just grab some treasuries and that way you won't have your portfolio getting kicked in the face so bad. HAHAHA I love my life
"113.44 / 7.11 = 15.95 PE as today without counting other factors like debt, cash and growth ...However, JNJ is very cheap to most or all stocks in its sector when considering other factors.For example, MDT PE is 16.2 without cash-debt consideration, but MDT negative cash-debt/share consideration puts its PE around 20.With the same token, JNJ positive cash-debt/ share puts the PE under 14.Why this is matter? Most companies borrow money to buy income generated products but debt acts as a negative factor in their balance sheet. A company like VRX was traded around $265 per share with high income thru borrowed money but it did not last and now trades in $20s. JNJ is a long stable investments and dividend payments act like a fixed income assets while the chance for appreciation is very high thru share price."
"If JNJ is serious about rapidly developing a vaccine for coronovirus they should look to either partner with or acquire INO. My guess,if they act quickly is that the entire company can be bought for about 1and1/2 billon dollars. INO has claimed last week by their CEO Kim on tv that they have a vaccine."

The shorts trying to keep the share price of JNJ down is similar to holding a beach ball under water. You may be successful for a little while but the end result is she shoots up higher. Watching JNJ continue to march higher and the loon kristopher lose his dumb(_Y_) mind.

Those put options folks got baked the last 2 weeks. Trolling a Yahoo conversation page has never worked. GL to all the JNJ longs that hung in there and added to your position.
I believe this stock is a loser. Has been trending down from jan. There is a good chance this company will be in the doubledigits.

"Just read an article regarding JNJ: ""The venerable Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is so large that it has multiple domains of expertise in which its drug development pipeline has paid off over time. Between its collection of three medicines for pulmonary hypertension and its six ongoing clinical trials to expand their indications, it's no surprise that the company's disease segment earned $2.6 billion in 2019 alone. Likewise, Johnson & Johnson's portfolio of four oncology drugs brought in 8.6% more revenue in 2019 than 2018 as a result of a number of growth-oriented clinical trials. Management is also skilled at getting its drugs approved in international markets. The company operates with equal proficiency in the U.S. and the E.U., and its sales in the Asia-Pacific region remain strong, growing by 4.9% last year. When paired with its aggressive indication-expanding trials, J&J's international expertise is a key component of its growth engine. It also helps the company to hedge against economic downside risk, as its geographical segments are unlikely to be contracting at the same rate at the same time."""

This thing should easily get to 134. Buyers just need to come out to play.
15.26 million shorts. Stock selling on the news.
FDA approval ADIL GOING TO BEAT NVAX
Please split JNJ now. We need some happiness.
Look like we’re moving toward $155
Don't really mind it going down. Bought a few more
Some buyers came back but in four minutes it’s fall another $5 
Yep this is showing signs of weakness. I’d say 145 by next week.
Damage to credibility will never be repaired. Back under $130 by end of day tomorrow.
is JNJ finally going to break the 145 resistance?
Relentless selling on ex divy day..Interesting
Looks like JNJ does not ever want to go down. Not that I am complaining. I just want to add more but not at these insane prices. But pretty soon this might look cheap.
"Until the BOD splits the stock, its not going anywhere."
Add position today between 122.5 to 127 and will hold for long term for dividend incomes.
$130 Plus today!
But then again what do I know? I bought Rocket Mortgage (RKT) yesterday and more again today LOL
"Young investor here, just bought my first 15 shares of JNJ today. Looking for a stock to throw money at over the years and generate income in my future and I just can’t resist this one. Hope I’m not too late to the party!"

Opioid Liability Train is a Comin’ (opinion only).
what does the new proposal from California means to jnj?
"Look for explosion new cases in Georgia this weekend, which could send investors back to safety plays, like JNJ. The market has rallied way to much and looks like fading ehre at S&P 200-day trend line.....looks for rotation back to safety - $JNJ"
"Yes, sell everything and go away, quality or trash. Nothing works in this market."
I think this is only most diversity and non secular growth company in this environment .
Moderna has just pulled back
shartbait are you making a false statement or is this coming from jnj?
Wow thanks for the cheap shares. Added a bit more in this silly selloff.

A good buying opportunity today.
BREAKING out soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Bullish news for JNJ & imo, ARWR ARWR in 4 different trials with JNJ, at least one is for the China virusFDA approval appears near thru Operation Warp Speed"
Very predictable. Uptrend continues.
JNJ knowing about the asbestos in the powder is like how a cigarette company sells its products. Only difference is that people knew about the dangers of cigs....
Hopefully this will be a breakout week for JNJ - Phase III clinical trial results for the covid vaccine and Q4 earnings as well. Looking for minimum $170 - potentially $175 or pushing $180 by end of the week
When is ex- div date?
Nice buy up after hours
LOL...everyone will be vaccinated by June! But they are selling it for no profit so that's real good news or J&J..

"I have been wandering about this for quite some time and if someone have the answer, please tell me.Only for learning purpose, as I still try to learn my way around this crazy stock market.It is a mystery to me why people want to invest in JNJ, with a pe of 25 and a debt of $7B, when you can invest in novo nordisk with a pe of 28, but half the market cap size and a positive budget of $3B.Not to mention that novo nordisk is about to launch a whole new product with insane proven data to help people lose weight, that also has no competition on the market at all.Why do people invest in JNJ in this scenario?For me novo nordisk has the better financials and also the best growth opportunities thinking about market cap and product launch. Not to mention, that the US companies is about to get taxed even more than today.Why do people invest in JNJ in this scenario?"
"Between $J&J, GERN, & $ALO I feeling real confidence going into this year!  Good Luck All."
Watch the price jump after next Sunday news about JnJ study with GERN on Imet! :) Monday will be know as GErn Monday.
Debbie I originally bought most of my shares between 1.27and 1.80 and 1000 at 2.10 I sold everything at 2.40 and reinvested everything between 1.00 and 1.80 and ended up with 60%more shares than I had before I’m about even right now. Debbie don’t forget it is only MONEY
Sick of watching. In @ $121.07 for a likely LT hold. Sold some CELG I had a small gain in after today's spurt.Kel
Kentucky Attorney General is sueing JNJ for being responsible for Opioid problem plus a number of brokers cut their PT on JNJ. Disaapointed in Q1 results. Pharma sales may be weaker in 2018. So now you know why today price action has taken place. I am sure they are waiting for the dust to settle and then they will go back in and buy at these lower levels. Classic stock manipulation.
I don't own this one but hoping that they report well as it's a bellwether and will help the sector and the Dow.
Huge news! Phase 3 trials!
"JNJ vaccine for C19, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlFOEyyGFOo"

"First we had Dave and Nancy,they were muted now another, Traveler.traveler,and anyone else posting irrelevant political stuff on this site please understand that you will be reported then muted.please stop wasting your time."
wanna see 150！！！
rumor has it that $JNJ will either partner with $NVAX or do a buyout
Just pre holiday profit taking today
"Why is this multiple so high, it's been there for over a year."
"Sightbox shut down. Yet another failed acquisition by JnJ. Sure acquisitions are always risky, but JnJ batting average is embarrassingly low, and NO ONE is ever held accountable. SB was essentially a warehouse distribution process for JnJ. Is that JnJs business model? Of course not. But high ups make their mark with acquisitions IF they go well. That they are never held accountable when they go wrong means they’re willing to spend shareholder money foolishly."
give the JNJ vacancies to Russia and the likes - we will keep the good stuff here
only up $6 AH
I hope Johnson Johnson has to pay every penny of that 4.7 billion dollars in more to come
i should have bought in 2016 when it was 125. This is heading to 200 plus
"There is evidence that antibodies may last longer with the JNJ vaccine than others. Also no vaccine has a 72% efficacy with one dose. Who knows what JNJ may show after its 2 dose study, but even one dose is enough to eliminate the virus."
what's going on with JNJ?
I like JNJ they are solid their products are everywhere. They are gonna be hard to shake of even if economy plays funny games....

"Most investors do not know that BIVI is a Nash drug for treating ascites an advanced stage of liver cirrhosis. BIVI has had favorable Phase 2 trial data and has applied for patents in the United States (which was approved), China, and Japan. BIVI has FDA orphan designation and Fast Track designation. Expect top-line results in June/July 2018. It has been manipulated and controlled by short players. Now that the Nash section is heating up I expect this stock to move higher. At $0.04 a share, it is probably the best opportunity in the market today. Buy, hold, and accumulate. DD."
PFE's shot may not turn out to be the panacea everyone believes it to be. Some are sounding the alarm of serious reactions to the shot if you have allergies. So how does that work when it requires two shots for this to be effective? If you have a serious reaction the first go round you're not going back for a second so there's zero benefit. Maybe it's best to wait and see what JNJ is offering.
Lots of Jan 135 calls being bot.
Sanofi said they're willing to produce 12M vaccines a month for JNJ.
The marijuana sector seems to be having a rough three months.
sell at 123.33
Joe Congress should investigate the relationship between Johnson and Johnson and the FDA also how do they get the drugs approve so quickly why these other company have to wait years in years and years this can of worms are about to be opened
Heading toward flat on the year..what a turd stock
Efficacy of JNJ Coronavirus vaccine is disappointing. I'm not buying the Dr. Fauci hype that it doesn't matter because something is better than nothing. Nothing is not the option the public is facing. They will reject the JNJ vaccine. Go back to the lab and get it to work.
Very good opportunity to buy JNJ at a discount
I would expect phase 3 trial results by end of week before earnings ...
Vaccine stocks are the way to go. Out of tech and into Vaccine's and J&J is a good choice
Close under $130 is very bearish like I said on Friday
Did they know it caused heart problems???
This company has taken too much beaten and yet it's still standing tall.short interests will get squeezed soon.
„ Watch this video capturing our frontline superheroes at the Kentucky Distribution Center as they receive and celebrate the initial shipment of the first doses of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The vaccine will be safely stored while awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “
"Not too surprising. The louder and more strident that the forum trolls get, the better JNJ performs. My favorite contrarian indicator once again!"
Looks like we will go past 126 and make new highs. Hope ye'll loaded up in low 110's. Enjoy the ride.
Ppbskis the baby powder lawsuits are just the tip of the iceberg
JNJ AUTHORIZED
"For those who shorted on the talc news a week ago good for you for making your money.For those who stood long and trusted JNJ until the second test came out ,good for you for making your money.This is the best news it could have gotten because it is a great comeback story."
The sad “men” supporting J and J actually make me physically ill. Defending a corporation proven to of sold asbestos laden talc because they lost a couple thousands bucks when the SP dropped.You guys are actually disgusting.
They seem to halt everything these days...that won't even move the stock
Why is this down on a 140 plus Dow day?
JNJ needs to get and keep the share price around $140+/- so they can buy out GERN in the near future. JMHO mind you.
FYI health care sector is backtesting a breakout. Entire sector is likely to run JNJ will rally off trend line support.
JNJ will very likely hit new highs by Feb/Mar 2020. It's a good time to buy/add shares of this fine company here.
ONE FIFTY ON THE WAY
Why is jnj ok but teva getting destroyed
"There will be additional 4-5 COVID19 Vaccines coming in 3-12 months (like $OCGN Covaxin with Bharat Biotech); which is good for the consumers, more competitions will bring more effective vaccines with lower cost for us. As said we need to be vaccinated against COVID19 EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT 5/6 YEARS until we have something permanent inactivated vaccine. World is new with this disease and so are the treatments/vaccines. We have 3-4 vaccines (like $MRNA, $BNTX, $JNJ, $PFE) in the USA market so far and we are glad to have those with any cost! COVID19 vaccine market is huge and will have room for all the great companies for the next 5-6 years or more. so, hold your horses and sit tight."
"All the crying tells me one thing , you’re to stupid to hold JNJ long like it should be and 2 you shorted the stock and got toasted lmao"
impression from management was that the numbers would be more impressive in line with Moderna and Pfizer so you can see why some selling is here....but better times coming and end of day will be much closer to GREEN - 2nd dose results should be real BOOSTER SHOT TO THE ARM OF SHAREHOLDERS. Boolean
"To close the circle (for now) on $GERN, I just heard back from a $JNJ spokesperson re: imetelstat:“With regards to imetelstat and our partnership with Geron, no decision has been made yet by Janssen.""Tweet from Adam Feuerstein just now"

Dividend yield ever so close to 3%
Hello 170s!
"JNJ is dealing with a lot of lawsuits that the top management created. Once it all clears, they better reward shareholders big time. One time big special dividend? Big dividend increase?"
I didn't know reuters published hit pieces!
"I bought $INO while it was $8+ a month ago and not sure if I made the right decision. As time goes by, it seems $JNJ, $SNF, and $MRNA are ahead in the curve for a possible Covid-19 vaccine. Any insight?"
Is it wrong to want to see what an 8 billion dollar rack looks like?
"Many of you seem to be unaware that JNJ is selling their vaccine at cost. It can be the greatest thing in the world, but financially speaking it will do nothing for their bottom line."
Big companies with large overseas operations / profits will get crush under new tax law.. Bring jobs back to America.. JNJ well come home and see ya at $130
"What about the law suits pending,against this very quality company.I had it for years but didn't feel comfortable with the legal matters.."

FACT below but imo raided
"I would like to buy more J&J in my retirement account but why would anyone take 50/50 coin-flip Vaccine? Why wait for it if Pfizer or Moderna are at 95% efficacy and readily available ? I am not getting it,"
"JNJ is down almost -5% in a month on its vaccine news. FACT! Not my opinion. Nobody wants a vaccine that’s 66% efficacy when you can get multiple vaccines that are 95% + I keep reading posts in single shot and storage. You all should educate yourself bout all the other vaccines. Single shots as well just higher efficacy with two, except for JNJ. Other vaccines can be stored in a regular refrigerator for 30 days and hospitals use them up faster than that. EU, Scandinavian counties are banning the JNJ vaccine along with the the Mayor of Detroit. All equals JNJ price will continue to fall while others keep skyrocketing. If you were to educate yourself on other vaccines plus US already bought enough vaccine from Moderna & Pfizer. Sell this junk "
"I'm surprised there have been no comments about the Bloomberg article posted earlier today with the headline:""J&J's Sudden Talc-Cancer Settlements Aren#$%$ Usual Style.Check out the 18th (I think I counted correctly) paragraph.Where is this article? Below JNJ quote."
I wait for $120 and lower.
Nice rebound today!
Increased their dividends for the last forty years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How do you go wrong???????????
I wouldn't trust baby powder from Johnson and Johnson let alone a vaccine.
"Take your Prozac, Spammer. JNJ longs watch the manufacturing partner, EBS ... Looking forward to JNJ earnings and vaccine update"
why is this going up for the last one week almost from 135 to 142 i am happy it is going up but I want understand
"Buying. Strong fundamentals, div and possible pop on Covid19 -buying small position to hold a year"
"people like to buy at high price, and sell at panic drop. Great opportunity...bullish!!!"
"Why the sudden drop from 140.40 to 139? I know this is not a day trading stock, just curious. Thanks"
So creepy lol. Acting like I care she’s leaving
Thank you Charles and you too Deborah for your responses. Computershare also manage my JNJ stock holding and DRIP is a great way to save.
I am still disappointed in management as I bought the stock on their extremely positive pre-release discussion on the vaccine and then it is not what we thought... I don't like being misled....
Ashley DID you KNOW that the fastest growing segment of JNJ is its legal department
I have been buying a few more shares in recent days based upon faith in the company. Why would the market be punishing this stock or downgrading the company at this time. Buying more shares makes me nervous but they will be worth more later!!
Recover some tomorrow? Let’s see.
"Is this JNJ pop due to positive results from Vaccine clinical trial? Which phase of clinical trial is JNJ performing now? I love JNJ, one of the greatest companies in the world!"

Overall, AMD is holding up well with the China matter and I expect it will continue.$SNAP also holding up well in the tech sector for 2019. Evan Speigel doing what it takes to mold the executive team around his vision. Elon allowing buyout talk to help the stock isn't a bad strategy.

Isn't this just a one time charge? The territorial tax system the trump's tax bill implemented imposes a one time tax in exchange for not paying U.S. taxes on revenues earned in (and taxed by) other countries. This stock looks oversold today unless I'm missing something. The numbers excluding the charge were excellent.

Just look at the cancer rate. Eveyone looking for what causes the cancers including jnj as he said in interview well maybe its as simple as looking under your nose baby powder ? Breast cancers way up also ? Is baby powder in under arm deodorant?

Gosh! The number of spammers and trolls on this board is mind boggling. I could just keep on muting all day and they keep on coming back!

JNJ data in primates good outcome
"Not clear what their potential max liability is. I don't think I'd go rushing in yet. The Tylenol thing wasn't even JnJ's fault and isn't comparable. This is their fault. Its also women who buy most of JnJ's range of products , whether for themselves or for family. They will be the ones who the reputational damage will really settle in with. Expect to see this lumped in with #MeToo by some as further evidence of disdain for women. Don't think so? Thats the current climate we are in."

"Who is worried / concerned about the Presidents latest directive on opioids? I am a little worried it could be another rash of legal suits, but on the other hand it might be public relations opportunity for JNJ and subsidiaries. Either way it may impact price and availability of all opioids and some companies might find themselves pushed out of the opioid niche by economic pressure and government interference."
When this stupid lawsuit hit the Supreme Court it will be zero. Attorneys will happily still cash all their paychecks.

"J&J’s effort to protect its iconic Baby Powder franchise by shaping research was led by physician and scientist executives. An early 1970s study of 1,992 Italian talc miners shows how it worked: J&J commissioned and paid for the study, told the researchers the results it wanted, and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal.The effort entailed other attempts to influence research, including a U.S. government study of the health of talc workers in Vermont. J&J’s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary, one of several mine operators involved in the study, developed a relationship with the U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health researchers to “even influence the conclusions” through suggestions of “subjective interpretations,” according to a 1973 Windsor Minerals memo."

"INSIGHT- Inside J&J's Latam COVID vaccine trial, a rush to recruit is followed by disappointment""At first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you 'that's it,'"" he said. ""You understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.""Peru, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia had all offered to participate in the trial, hoping that would give them preferential access to J&J's vaccine in the global race to stockpile doses. J&J told Reuters in September that those hosting trials would have priority for vaccine supply.Now some in government circles and the public health community fear those deals could be compromised. And local researchers have been left wondering whether they will be fully compensated for their investment in incomplete trials.J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers."

JNJ ought to sue the hell out of Reuters. Freedom of the press is one thing but there also is a responsibility of the press to be honest with that freedom.

All these years in past presidents is China's been getting richer richer and rUnited States is getting in more and more and more debt it has to stop somewhere President Trump was voted by the citizens of the United States of America you probably voted for Hillary and probably contributed to her campaign and you're still bitter that you lost.

"Judge Reduces DePuy Pinnacle Hip Damages to $500 MillionJANUARY 13, 2017By: Staff WriterHIP REPLACEment The U.S. District Judge presiding over all U.S. DePuy Pinnacle hip replacement lawsuits recently cut the amount of punitive damages awarded to plaintiffs by roughly half, from approximately $1 billion to $500 million. The judge upheld the full amount of compensatory damages.$1 billion in damages reduced due to constitutional concernsIn early December, a federal jury decided to award more than $1 billion in damages during a the bellwether trial for cases alleging injuries caused by the DePuy Pinnacle hip replacement. The amount included punitive damages, intended to punish the manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, and its subsidiary, DePuy Orthopedics."
What a pop on news
Seriously disappointed in JNJ... company has been around forever and cannot even produce an effective vaccine..

Johnson & Johnson is My Favorite Dividend King For Reliable Dividend Growth And Income. This dividend king has paid dividends since 1944 and has managed to increase them for 56 years in a row. Dividend increases have been like clockwork every year for decades. JNJ raised its dividend by 7.10% to 90 cents/share last week. Check my analysis below:https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/2018/04/johnson-johnson-my-favorite-dividend.html
These opioid cases are completely bogus and politically motivated going into election season. The FDA and Dr's should foot 50% clean u bill. People who abuse drugs should be responsible for the other 50% since they can't follow directions. $JNJ $TEVA $MYL $ENDP $RDY $PFE
"Back to where this should be 160+ today. Future is positive and expect JNJ to gradually increase as covid vaccines rollout globally and more data comes in on the 2nd dose, WHO and EU approvals."

Scooped up some discount shares under $133 on a limit order. Loving this gift!
Gorski will lead JNJ into the battlefields of the China plague. Longer than the Great Wall of China.
JNJ will break the support and $120 is in view for time being. More shaves later next week.
I don’t think there are very many that understand the drop here. Hanging tight. It will come
Are JNJ bandaids toxic? Wouldn’t surprise me. Time to clear my entire home of JNJ products that have become very questionable in terms of safety.
"This isn't a total failure, one dose is obviously less effective than 2 doses and still better than nothing. Also no deep freeze need this will be great for third world countries"
Novavax seems to have benefitted from this pause for time being. It may be the dark horse to win the vaccine race or acquired by a big Pharma like Merck or Roche or Novartis.
most certainly JNJ and Geron will be sued for their activity in Sept moments prior to the continuation decision.
What effect the class action suit will have?
why are the analysts still down grading jnj
"Rising with good volume. Bullish technical indication in MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
"can anyone explain why none of these ""vaccines"" prevent covid? I thought the whole reason for a vaccine is to stop it from every taking over your body? These things sound like a new marketing for a flu shot makes no sense"

"Can it hold $121?Last week, we hoped to hold $122 and now $121. Pretty soon, we will be worry about holding $120, $119 and $115..."
Hot tip: when you are a monster like the JandJ shareholder. Your only strategy and defence is indignation. You are defending one of the lost disgusting companies in the world. That knowingly sold a cancerous product it knew would be used in babies.So what you have to do is act shocked at being called a monster. Anything to distract form the fact you are morally void sub humans.
this is a bs article there's no truth behind it show is documentation
"This is one of the widest held stocks. It would take a while for holders to unload, thus much more to fall. GE just experienced it."
"Oncology is one of the key pharmaceuticals portfolio for J&J with sales of over $7 billion in 2017, and we forecast this figure to double by the end of our forecast period, led by a ramp up in sales of existing drugs, Imbruvica, Darzalex, and Zytiga, and contribution from its new compounds. The company’s late stage oncology pipeline currently includes, 8 programs each for Darzalex and Imbruvica, along with new compounds, Apalutamide, Imetelstat, and Erdafitinib."
It seems off that JNJ that is going to come up with the wonder one shot drug that does not require ultra strict handling criteria. This would be incredible!! What is the efficacy rate is 80% which vaccine would you take?
"Once we close above $150, we take out the 52 week high. $175-$180 by April. $225 by 2022 and a 4 for 1 split."

"Cervical cancer. 14 thousand lawsuits. 14 thousand people had their mom and dads (maybe dads) treat their children day after day after day with JNJ powder, since there was nothing else on the market 25-40 years ago?I don't own JNJ yet, but my 7 girls (bless me god), are age 38-31 years of age. They along with my 10 grandchildren use JNJ powder to this day. Oh, I know have 4 grandboys thank god.So let me understand this lawsuit. The lawyers collect the majority of the settlement in all cases that may go to court and win some money.. The 14,000 people who wan't some money may receive some of the settlement, if there is any. Then the appeals process starts, and will take many years to collect anything. My understanding, if these suits go on for a few years, the legal fees will balloon, and as they do the legal fees will take the majority of any settlement from the 14,000 who are truthful and not some people who slip and fall at Walmart's, alwayslooking for a quick buck. In the end, if they win any money, it will be a penny on the dollar."
sell the news?
The sad fact is any type of drug can cause a small to major side effect. That is why we have doctors that must prescribe a drug before we are able to purchase it. CAUTION Putting chemicals into a human body is not normal. The body may react to the chemical.
Broke through 165. Strong technical support will reach 190 easy
JNJ finalized agreement today with european countries which Secures a vaccine for every citizen. Why isnt this making the Stock soar? Because vaccine not ready yet?
"Without Baby Powder, JNJ would decline. Late cycle stocks are about to go down. If Fed does not raise interest rate, that means something is wrong with economy. Then, Greenspan is correct. If Fed continues policy, the stocks will decline. Either way, stocks will suffer."

so this is good news for junkies. Someone else is at fault for your weakness.
"At current prices, JNJ is the most reasonable stock to buy and hold for long time and collect dividend. These are prices of 2016 when the income was at least 25% lower, no tax benefit and tied up cash outside of US.JNJ is brigning back tons of cash, income is higher at least 25% and more acquisitions are in the way. It will increase its dividend and price has no where to go but up."

Move everything to Novavax (NVAX).
You know its going to be huge tomorrow because JNJ never has this many people in a conversation on a Sunday
Another bloody day
"I was overweight JNJ (it was my largest individual equity holding), after selling ~40% of my shares today @139.16.IF JNJ splits, even with twice as many shares, I won't hold too many shares or be overweight. Thank goodness I sold before the split; if I hadn't, I would have had way too many shares.(It all comes down to the number of shares one owns and not the value of a position, right?)"
You would have to be living under a huge rock to not know that the vaccine would be approved for use. Now the big question is! How much of the stock price has already been baked in by Wall Street? Is this really a catalyst to make the stock move up. Almost every one on this board has been expecting a bump to North to take place. I would like that to happen. However I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t. Best to all
no reason to trust anything JNJ does.
Going to $120
Don't know about you but I intend to vote no for every director and the executive compensation when I get my proxy. This stock can not break 140 or if it does sustain it. The stock needs to split. At least new investors might be tempted to buy it at $ 70 per share
Dec 31st $138
What a great day. Made a lot of money shorting this P0S hard. Monday I will be back. See you later snowflakes. By the way - YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD!
why is this stock up only a few cents?
uh oh asbetos found in baby powder stock down this morning 4%
JNJ owns the rights the Purell correct? They bought from Pfizer back on 2010. You cant find this stuff anywhere. Its all sold out. This has to be good for JNJ. At least I would think so lol
66% percent - not a risk i want to take - I wait for the better stuff and continue to stay home
"Elective surgery down big, means medical devices etc down.. this will test 120 again.. Good div, excellent balance sheet, developing a covid vaccine, but earnings will hurt."
"By the time their vaccine is ready for market, they may be forced to sell it for minimal profit by a Democratic government. Caveat Emptor"
would this be a entry point? do you think well see under 100$
JNJ will be fine.
I gotta say something here. JNJ has become such a huge disappointment in these past few months. A huge company with twice the resources of moderna and the same access to federal funds and yet they did not even start their first phase trial. All other companies are already in their 3rd trial and have signed contracts with other countries for their vaccine. Nothing justified having this stock above 150 back in April (which by the way i believe is a result of stock manipulation). I am going to change my position to short. Good luck to everyone
"Zytiga just went generic. Disaster for part of Q4 but 2019 will be bad, really bad."

"J&J's Cerenovus: First Ischemic Stroke Patients Treated With EMBOTRAP II Revascularization Device Since Comml Availability in U.S.8:39 AM ET 07/24/2018First Ischemic Stroke Patients Treated With EMBOTRAP II Revascularization Device Since Commercial Availability In U.S.CERENOVUS Launches Next Generation Stent Retriever at Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) Annual MeetingSAN FRANCISCO, July 24, 2018 -- CERENOVUS, part of the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices Companies, announced the first patients have been treated with its new EMBOTRAP II Revascularization Device since it became commercially available in the U.S. EMBOTRAP II is a next generation stent retriever used to capture and remove life- threatening blood clots from the brain following an ischemic stroke. The company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to market the mechanical clot removal, or thrombectomy, device in May and is launching EMBOTRAP II at this week's Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) 15(th) Annual Meeting.""The EMBOTRAP II is an important new device for treating stroke patients and an important advancement in mechanical thrombectomy,"" said Andrew DeNardo, MD, an interventional neuroradiologist with Goodman Campbell Brain & Spine, who along with John Scott, MD, Daniel Sahlein, MD, and Richard Paulsen, MD, recently performed thrombectomies with the device at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital and St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis.The EMBOTRAP II Device, with its proprietary dual-layer design, engages and grips stroke-inducing blood clots differently than other stent retrievers, allowing a doctor to maintain engagement and control of the clot with minimal compression during removal. It is indicated for use within eight hours of symptom onset.""Blood clots can originate in different parts of the body, resulting in different clot types,"" said Dr. Scott. ""These different clot types present unique retrieval challenges during mechanical thrombectomy. The design of the EMBOTRAP II Device helps minimize these challenges and my early experience has been positive."""

Where is this gonna be in a decade you guys think and why?
JNJ folks go check out the price target on ACHV
Someone must have downgraded the stock because all indications are the company had a great Q1. Except for some expenses net was up along with top line revenues. Very puzzeled by the morning open. I thought for a moment i had gone color blind!!!
"JNJ, MSFT and V are few of my best quality holdings. I have positions held for long term and short term. For the short term trade since S&P 500 has hit the short term resistance of 2750, all positions are closed. Will open selling puts once the price corrects. I believe we will have a double bottom, that means S&P 500 will hit 2200 again."
"One risk was with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Facebook (FB) , two long-time favorites of Jim. He said JNJ is a fabulous company, but with the recent $29 million verdict against it and thousands of other lawsuits pending, it's enough to rattle even the most steadfast investors."

It's so funny cuz the analysts lower your expectations the last time because Johnson Johnson said sales were going to be lower imo this cartel is not selling more you're just jacking prices on drugs that people need to save their lives

"Cancer blamed on baby powder? Now, I have heard everything..."
Why is JNJ down?
"let's see how far it will go down today, not good"
I'd really like a close above $150 going into the weekend.
Looks like someone is shorting this stock. The stock price on this company is being manipulated to go lower because someone is wanting to profit on it. I think the feds need to investigate who is manipulating this stock to to lower when it should be going higher.
How many of you fake investors claiming to be long JNJ got spooked out of your shares so real investors could pick them up at a pre-Christmas discount? Thumbs down only if you're a faker please.

JNJ is now has the most UPSIDE for vaccine !way undervalued here.
6 months to date the stock was 123.50 now it's still over $10 higher. Let that sink in for a minute.
A steady trend that could take us to the upper 140s by year end. GLTAL
My quarterly reinvestment posted at 130.0623 this morning. Curious where others had their's posted since timing of dividends seem to be all over the map depending on your broker.
"I know a person who panicked yesterday and sold his entire 600 thousand portfolio. I didn't ask him how much he lost over the last couple of weeks. It's so sad when people panic and lose thousands. Buffett is right, it was time to buy. In the long run things will recover just as JNJ will. There isn't any asbestos in Talc that they sell. We will see 150 again. It requires patience, and dividends will keep increasing. GLTA"
go jnj
Congrats to those who muted the doomsayers & bought in the low 120's back in May-June.
Great opportunity to for selling put today. The $120-130 spread for January is going for about a $125. No way this is going below $130 in a month.

"JNJ is so corrupt. Since 1957 they knew about asbestos being used in their baby powder. They NEVER disclosed it as an ingredient on the product label. For 60 years they lied, misled and induced a carcinogen in direct contact with human skin. This is about as vil as any company behavior in US History. There are early lawsuit as well citing JNJ talcum as a link to Ovirian cancer. JNJ is appealing that case which surface years ago. Now the news on asbestos comes after and it is a nightmare for JNJ. They tried to cover up in a previous lawsuit, issued an appeal and yet another source identified asbestos in their product without them disclosing this. How can JNJ be trusted ever again?"
A probe does not assume guilt. DOJ just doing it's due diligence. Hundreds of studies have proven talc to be safe. This should resolve the argument once and for all. The market reaction is typical. Throw the baby out with the bath water. Overreactions are never a time to sell. Plus if the stock was $200 today I wouldn't be selling. Let's see where we are in 5 years. GLTA longs while we battle yet another headline story.

Event details:The MicroCap ConferencePresenter: Jonathan Adams, Chief Executive OfficerDate: Monday, April 9th, 2018Time: 5:00 pm ETLocation: Essex House, New York CityFollowing the event, a copy of the company overview presentation by Mr. Adams will be posted in the “Press Releases” section of BioVie’s website at: http://www.biovieinc.com/investors/#recent-pressAbout BIV201BioVie is conducting a US Phase 2a clinical trial of its Orphan Drug candidate, BIV201, which has FDA Fast Track status and US patent protection. This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. The initial disease target for BIV201 therapy is ascites, which is the most common serious complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. The FDA has never approved a drug specifically indicated to treat ascites. The active agent in BIV201, terlipressin, is approved for use in about 40 countries for the treatment of related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis but is not available in the US or Japan. BioVie has applied for additional Orphan-drug designations for other life-threatening conditions associated with advanced liver cirrhosis."

Amazing that they beat imo with all the negative news lawsuits and politicking. Thank your lucky stars if you are a long.
Any news on approval?
Fantastic quarter. Much more upside from here...that vaccine is going to pull the stock price skywards. This company is a must own for anyone looking for income and long term capital gains. This stock doesn't reward quickly though. It takes patience and knowledge of the fact this company is extremely durable in both good times and bad.

I just found a very different kind of biotech company that deals with various diseases in a very novel way and it might be of interest to JNJ. The symbol is NNVC. Take a look and see if you agree? I asked the same question on the PFE board where I also hold a substantial position.
Two of the best small biotech and possible takeover companies are AVEO and GALT. Aveo drug Tivozanib received NICE positive opinion for first-line treatment of RCC. EU approved Tivozanib for advanced RCC in 2017. AVEO will complete Tivozanib phase 3 trial in 2 QT of 2018. Plus it's pipeline is worth billions. GALT completed its phase 2B trial for Nash liver cirrhosis and had positive clinical statistical results for patients without esophageal varices. It also has a pipeline worth billions of dollars.

Wanted to get the JNJ shot but also wasn't sure it would be approved by the time I was able to get in to get my first vaccine. Long story short went to Levi's Stadium (49ers) today and got my first Pfizer shot. Must say Santa Clara County here in Northern California has there act together. Was a very smooth operation. In and out in 35 minutes from start to finish. Plus got to be inside one of the nicest Football Stadiums in the NFL. Get vaccinated with whatever vaccine is available when it's your turn. It's a very liberating experience when you get the vaccine.

Records of asbestos in talc at JNJ regards industrial talc that JNJ sold. Plaintiffs lawyers are trying desperately trying to make the leap and spread panic.

"I have been an investor for over 30 years and covid brought to us one of the greatest opportunity to consolidate big gains in a short amount of time. Now the vaccine race will give us a further push and regardless I will hold the this stock for a long time. However, in this specific moment, the therapeutics companies are the one with the biggest potential, after the FDA approval of Regeneron, others will for sure follow. And specifically I’m looking at CytoDyn $CYDY that already showed the best statistical significance with Leronlimab on CD12, other than a proven efficacy for HIV and cancer. And within days will be skyrocketing. GLTA"
Now is a good time for JNJ to replace 500 low powered lawyers with 1000 high powered lawyers.
As mark said it be very careful about JNJ since it may go way above $140 without any notice or alarm.
"Good bye WTO. You helped China infect the world, which led to 365,000 deaths. the doctors, staff and management of the WTO are conflicted, as they realize the more pandemics there are, the more money they will get with their research budgets and drugs sales. Everyone in the WHO who did what China told them, should lose their medical licenses. And be banned from holding any medical job for the rest of their lives. And part of their wealth should be spent on restitution for victims. Its good to see the WTO defunded. Hopefully we'll see other corrupt world organizations get defunded as well. And a public trial of the people that colluded with China would bring some sense of justice for all of us who have suffered because of them."

So many scientists on this board.
"Mom, Apple Pie, Chevrolet and JNJ."
No reason this stock should be down. JNJ to save the world.
"If Esketamine Nasal Spray is a disappointment the why the stock was running in past two days?""This clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind study of two fixed doses of esketamine, 56 mg and 84 mg. The study did not demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoint, change in a depression severity rating scale score from baseline to four weeks, for esketamine 84 mg plus oral antidepressant compared to oral antidepressant plus placebo. Therefore, based on the prespecified analysis plan, the esketamine 56 mg plus oral antidepressant group could not be formally evaluated in this study.""If it was any other stock, then it could drop by 5% since the study DID NOT DEMONSTRATE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE for the primary endpoint."
Patience may be a virtue but correct timing is Divine lol.

Why do you sound so surprised This was already baked prior to this approval. This isn’t a hedge fund free stock
I am just here to buy some bandaids. Is this the right spot 
jnj was less than 120 a year ago goerge... check your research before u speak sweety...
Time for this stock to split and time to get rid of Gorsky. He's almost as bad as Jeffrey Immeldt!
Wonder why some selling yet they would buy crypto- or Tesla. Go figure.
What happened?
"Funny. Yahoo mobile shows old messages. Conversartion 1 year ago goes like this: - 110 end of month, too many lawsuits - Dead money - No, 128 by eom - 160 in a year, 200 after that - I am happy with my dividends, this will recover...So, it's all the same; better to take advantage of price swings like this."
"Dividend bragging sounds so stupid to me and maybe it is that I missing something truly profound. JNJ was at 154; heading to 2018 levels, still have the same number of unsolved legal issues, and they have already saying that sales will be down. if the unemployment goes up, then their healthcare sector will suffer too.why does a of $0.95 makes up the fact that the stock has gone down from 154 to 136? projected to drop further. Is $0.95 more than $18 so far?if you have own this stock for more than a month, you are either loosing money or lost an opportunity to buy cheaper and/or take profits out. plain and simple.you have no reason to believe anything i say and you certainly should not be listening to any pumper bragging about dividends.there are better buying opportunities ahead."
Purdue Pharma's offer to pay $10-12 BILLION does not bode well for JNJ. MUCH lower prices ahead. Don't say you haven't been warned.

Most recent PPS just before 3:00 Eastern Geron was up about .60 (11%). People expecting favorable CD of funding decision by JNJ by end of week. Gern's imetelstat looks to be a blockbuster cancer drug.
"While the stock price of JNJ is a bit rich, it's simply put, one of the greatest companies in the world. I've owned JNJ since the $40's and made the mistake of trimming a bit along the way, $95 and again at $120. The earnings were a beat today, but the headline number shows a $13B+ loss due to a one time tax hit. I am not a buyer here as I still have a substantial position, but also have no intention of selling at this point. The repatriated cash gives JNJ ammunition to pay down debt and/or buy back additional shares and/or do more acquisitions. If I had to guess they'll do all 3 just as they've successfully done throughout their history. JNJ is as strong as ever. Good luck JNJ longs."
"@support $151, should go up and test $154 again...."
The market is over-reacting. Hold tight. This is hysteria.

"Been buying on every dip caused by a lawsuit. JNJ survived the Tylenol Murders, these lawsuits are nothing compared to that. This company will still be around 100 years from now. These lawsuits are not a threat to the company's future."
"From what I have read, Oklahomans wanted $17billion and the judge awarded$500million.JNJ is appealing the decission and will probably win.This is a great result ,right!"

"Does anyone know how the collaboration of JANSSEN (J & J subsidiary) and VAXART on the oral Norovirus vaccine is progressing , if at all ?. I am hoping that perhaps Janssen will also work with them on the Covid Vaccine tablet."
Jnj already had said that they weren't intending to make profit on their vaccine to begin with. This has no material effect on earnings either way.
"Cramer bought this today !! Great. I bought at 130. today ,for the first time in years."

"Ridiculous ruling! No personal responsibility, no liability to the doctors who prescribe the drug....Stupid! The ONLY reason for the ruling is JNJ is a big corporation with a strong balance sheet.. Sickening! I hope they win on appeal and pay NOTHING!!"
More appreciation on the way JNJ is a monopoly no one can compete eith
absolutely great bounce but unfortunately nothing changed in the world to justify this crazy bounce. I think it will dip down below 135 again.
Besides having an amazing dividend that is considered an aristocrat dividend JNJ is only going up in stock price
great buy great products and great past performance
Ron can I hire you as my private financial advisor?
Beat on income and revenues.
Johnson and Johnson is clearly a buy. This company has so much money that they could pay the dividend alone and not make money for the next ten years. The litigation involved in the over hang of Johnson and Johnson will resolve itself over the course of time. This stock is conservatively worth 140.00 at a minimum. The price now has no or little down risk.
... kind of reminds me of PFE￼

JNJ will obviously appeal and the process will take years to play out without any money being rewarded to anyone except for the ambulance chasers (of course). This is all news driven ""nothingness."" Stay long JNJ and add positions when the stock drops today. Of course this is all my opinion. This country is in desperate need of ""extreme tort reform"". All of these frivolous meritless lawsuits must end or corporations will stop investing for the future altogether. Aggressive marketing - what a joke!!!! Doctors are to blame for this travesty and pain swept upon thousands of unsuspecting patients. We really need the AMA to take responsibility for this mess - that is where the real blame lies.

"I believe JNJ trades at a discount to its future value. It's vaccine should not only clear the FDA but provide a major boost to the stock price. I think all the lawsuits the company has been bogged down in over the new years have held it back from going over $200. This company is not only too big to kill it has major staying power in good times and bad and an excellent and safe dividend. I believe $160 is not a fair price for this company, and while it is a slow grower it is well worth the wait for future capital returns."

"JNJ stock down..... Johnson & Johnson's stock drops to pace Dow decliners after appeals court ruling on Zytiga disappointsFont size: A | A | A1:19 PM ET 11/21/18 | MarketWatchRELATED QUOTES 2:49 PM ET 11/21/18Symbol Last % ChgJNJ141.97 -3.06%XLV89.76 -0.29%Real time quote. Johnson & Johnson's stock drops to pace Dow decliners after appeals court ruling on Zytiga disappointsShares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) fell 3.3% in afternoon trade, enough to pace declines among its health care peers and among the Dow Jones Industrial Average's components, after reports that an appeals court ruled that J&J can't block sales of generic Zytiga while the company appeals the overturning of a Zytiga patent. In J&J's third-quarter ended Sept. 30, Zytiga sales rose 43.2% from a year ago to $958 million, making it the company's third-highest selling drug. Jennifer Taubert, worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals at J&J, said in the company's post-earnings conference call with analysts while the company was ""pleased"" with Zytiga, ""we're absolutely not dependent on it,"" according to a transcript provided by FactSet. The company said total pharmaceutical operational sales growth was 8.2%, but if Zytiga was removed, growth would have still been a ""really strong"" 6.6%. The stock has still gained 4.6% over the past three months, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF (XLV) has slipped 1.7% and the Dow has lost 4.6%."
The problem with JNJ stock isnt the vaccine. It's how big the company is already. Their market cap is about 20x NVAX. If they make the same amount of money on the vaccine the impact on the stock price will be 1 twentieth of the impact on NVAX stock
I predict that JNJ and OK will settle this before appeals are heard for $100M or less.
"In the more than 44,000-person study, the vaccine prevented 66% of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19, according to a company statement on Friday. And it was particularly effective at stopping severe disease, preventing 85% of severe infections and 100% of hospitalizations and deaths"
Long and strong
JNJUpgraded !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe JnJ should team up with AZN.
"this shows you JNJ is not a strong stock its a stock that people put their money in for dividends, retirement money"
"JNJ dropped from high $152 to current levels after the vaccine pause. It should be an easy retrace back to $150s. Anyway, the dividend is in the way, and getting some shares at current low prices is the best action in these volatile times."
It's due for a $10.00 run up. It will happen next week.
I'd panic if I wasn't in for the long haul....Time to buy even more .

Bull. Baby powder really. Ridiculous
Should I buy puts? 
New to investments.I like JNJ stock. yahoo shows Forward Dividend & Yield 3.60 (2.68%).Question 1: Is the dividend 2.68% or 3.60%Question 2: Is the dividend per stock you own or for every 100$ you invested in JNJQuestion 3: Forward dividend yield when googled says when the stock appreciates the dividend also increases. Is that true?Currently JNJ is at 136$. Say it goes to 200$ does the dividend also increases proportionately?
"""they're"" still tryin to bang it down"
"Sell, Sell, Sell"
Good time to buy more. Down for what reason?
"0.2 parts per millionThat's how much asbestos was ""found"" in the baby powder. That number is so low any random point in the earth would have that amount or higher.

I am glad I added more yesterday :)

"Corona treatment and vaccine will surely come out someday in the near future.And if the development is successful in either side, there is a high possibility that other pharmaceutical companies will release it in succession.In my personal opinion, Modena seems to be dominant in technology development, and Johnson & Johnson seems to be good at commercialization.Because corona treatment and vaccines are in demand worldwide by at least 100 million people, the ripple effect when they come out is likely to be more than what people think."
Baby powder with Fentanyl?......
Anyone that thinks this stock won’t get some big gains from the fda approval of a one shot vaccine for COVID is crazy.
Current drop in PPS is unfounded and ridiculous. All good news and great earnings for this giant company. Waaaaaay oversold. Insanity reigns on Wall street again.
Very good outcome. Great news for JNJ. Let's see how this plays out. Initial knee jerk reactions are always overblown. The judge still rules against JNJ and that may continue to weigh on the stock. I am sure JNJ will appeal the judgement.
I love the comments in JNJ .Find the people who are veterans in investing.
Deborah it's a simple question for you
Where did all the big mouths go
"Great News! WOHOOOO!!!! Lilly partners with AC Immune for Alzheimer's treatment $LLY, $PFE, $JNJ, $RHHBYUnder the terms of the deal, AC Immune will receive an upfront payment of 80 million Swiss francs ($80.47 million) and $50 million in exchange for a note convertible to equity at a premium, the companies said on Wednesday."
Thank you JNJ.
"Well this has been the worst stock I've bought in the past decade. It was supposed to be one of the safe boring stocks, high dividend and slow but consistent growth. Can anyone give me a reason to hold it? the massive settlements will be going on for years"
"At 132.50, the price is still too high."
buy buy on the drop
"Unfortunately, this vaccine just isn't anywhere near as efficacious as the Pfizer or Moderna. If given a choice, people should definitely choose Pfizer or Moderna."
Jnj in the process of breaking out of a 2-year range. Expect $180 in 2020.
Of course there is asbestos in talc - always was - just a matter of the amount - who really cares? Just don't smoke if you are breathing in asbestos.
If execs. unequivocally believe there isn’t a trace of asbestos in their baby powder then have a public display of their family members using the powder daily for a yr.
thsi is just another tactic buy the bears to drive the market lower. More bad news
Thank god i sold
this sector is in trouble. JNJ will be affected sooner or later.
Another Gorsky day coming up?
SHORT IT DONT LISTEN TO CRAMER
"The Nov 2019 version of Fortune magazine, on page 14, questioned the effectiveness of flu vaccines.Now you could ask why a globalist, liberal propaganda device would attack a prime source of revenue for the lefts greatest donor, big pharma. My guess is Fortune was told to plant the story, and told big pharma that many more would follow, if they didn't increase their campaign contributions, just like the big banks were threatened again recently by the left in congress."
Good night J&J stocks
Why isn't the FDA review scheduled sooner than 3 weeks from today so lives can be saved?
"JNJ is upgraded by Morgan Stanley:Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Get Report shares were higher Tuesday after a Morgan Stanley analyst boosted his rating of the healthcare-products maker to overweight from equal weight.Analyst David Lewis also increased his price target for the New Brunswick, N.J., company to $170 a share from $145.Johnson & Johnson is ""the most under-owned stock in healthcare,"" Lewis said in a note to investors. ""The J&J investment thesis is looking more attractive in 2020,"" Lewis wrote, "" as (1) multiple regulatory actions aimed at controlling pharmaceutical pricing are more reflected, (2) pharma growth like accelerates in 2020, which historically has lifted the multiple and (3) the portfolio is now more balanced with consumer stabilizing and medical devices and diagnostics coming off six consecutive quarters of momentum improvement.""Lewis said that ""structurally, many concerns have been addressed, and considering the stock appears to be pricing in significantly more legal liability than our probability-weighted analysis suggests, we see J&J's defensiveness returning, resulting in multiple expansion and outperformance in 2020."""
remember when JNJ baby powder was linked to cancer? YEah I sure do trust them....

"Very satisfying ruling. If market doesn't tank, +$10 over the next couple of weeks. Cover shorts, the sooner the better. Great company, great products, smart people."
I wish JNJ would just get out of the baby powder business.￼￼ this is ridicules.

let's go bulls
Just noticed the Yahoo 1y Target Est is 184.56....stock has come down ~ $8 from all time high. I can't understand this....is this manipulation or normal volatility for a low beta stock like JNJ?
The stock could have done a little better for the investors even though the government will pull the strings with the vaccines value.
Be advised Charles making False statements or did jnj send you this information the sec needs to look into .
"So far, it seems that $130 is too rich for some traders to hold. However, $129 is very critical to hold since it will put the stock in a range to be prepared to go to $140. Anyway, today gain isn't significant so far since it is recovering from last week drop by unfair and bogus lawsuit."
No shark bait but lying will

You don’t day trade this stock if you do you’re an idiot this is a long term investment with great dividends
SERVES JNJ RIGHT FOR SCREWING GERN
Cramer says look for the dips as a BUY here.
I knew Gorsky couldn't beat 2018. Worst CEO in the industry. Get the guy from Boeing. Anybody has to be better than Gorsky!
With difficulties occurring with the two shot rollout on Moderna and Pfizer I see this playing right into the hands of Johnson and Johnson's one shot vaccine. No need to worry about having enough vaccines in order to administer a second shot. JNJ will have a 100M. Currently the rollout is at 38M on the Pfizer and Moderna. Looks like a higher stock price scenerio for JNJ.
Clrb has lots of positive news!

"JNJ stock is trading at $128.42 a share. So while the shares have certainly bounced higher they have not come close to their December 13th high. In fact, the stock is signaling weak relative strength at this time. Traders should note that the stock is still trading below its important 200-day moving average, this is actually a sign of weakness. Should the stock break below the key $121.00 support level it would trigger another sell signal in the stock. The next major support level for JNJ stock would be around the $113.00 area. Right now, JNJ is hanging in there, but this is a stock that I will be watching closely."

"CVS reportedly removing J&J Baby Powder 22 oz. from shelves amid recallOct. 24, 2019 3:22 PM ET|About: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)|By: Douglas W. House, SA News Editor In response Johnson and Johnson's (JNJ -1.4%) voluntary recall of one lot of its Baby Powder due to possible asbestos contamination, CVS Health (CVS -1.1%) is reportedly removing the 22 oz. size from store shelves.Consumers shouldn't have to worry about supply, though, since the product is offered in as many as four other sizes."
"No clue why people post they expected more from JNJ SP. If you have paid attention to JNJ SP on good vaccine news last few months you should of been surprised. If you know anything about Moderna & Pfizer/BNTX and US vaccine purchases you shouldn’t of been surprised. If you know anything about efficacy of other vaccines and what they can be stored at (40 degrees for 5-7 days) then you shouldn’t of been surprised. All you who expected more and your knowledge on vaccines lacks a lot. This isn’t a game changer whatsoever. You call it bashing, but when I’ve been right it’s called telling you the truth. I know cause I’ve educated myself. I just don’t buy a stock and roll the dice. Without knowledge that’s exactly what you are doing. This isn’t going anywhere. Pfizer Biontech Moderna has already saved the world. 95% of it"
Why is it that Mrna gets all the attention and not Johnson and Johnson or Pfizer?
"Reuter's tried to portray that there is some smoking gun but there is really nothing new. JNJ defends the science and the scientific bias is weighted in favor of uncertainty about talc at best. To say JNJ knew use would ""cause cancer"" is simply not factual because outside research to date doesn't offer clarity. The problem too is that as with any product it can be applied in various ways and in some ways which were not intended or not anticipated by JNJ. While I'm certain the American Cancer Society position on talc has been posted here before it is worth reposting the link. The notion that talc could contain nominal asbestos particulate is nothing new what remains is whether it can or does cause cancers and at consumer exposure levels. The question is has no clear answer. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html"

"So, JNJ Q2 was excellent with a lot of progress Quarter/Quarter and Year/Year that will continue.The reason I say that will continue is Q/Q growth which is not in 10k.

Well well Ortho news
We’ve single handily driven out the apologists here. Anyone coming here will see the real facts and recent disgusting actions by JandJ.
2 words.... PHILLIP MORRIS
"turns out JNJ held the pharma update to get it done before two more failures in their pipeline to go along with talacotazumab. they included the two drugs they knew to be failures in their presentation, actually advertised a job for Imbruvica and Imetelstat three weeks before pulling out Imetelstat and listed Imetelstat as compassionate use before pulling it. numerous JNJ hematology and regulatory employees were sharing a Geron specific article on linked in a week prior to termination of Imetelstat. when asked if they realized the article was specific to Geron and not their pipeline, they did not respond. Geron and JNJ were nothing short of criminal in this ridiculousness."
"The judge wrote that “substantial evidence was adduced at trial of particularly reprehensible conduct” by Johnson & Johnson, including that the company “knew of the presence of asbestos in products that they knowingly targeted for sale to mothers and babies, knew of the damage their products caused, and misrepresented the safety of these products for decades.”"

Abbott purchased St. Jude and the stock making new high twice since then. Abbott made a brilliant move on acquiring St. Jude. It doesn't want to be in the same shoe of JNJ.

JNJ ... just as effective with much less complicated shipping restrictions.they have the ability to MASS produce !

"The logic of some people is ridiculous. The jnj vaccine is 72% 1 shot and its doesn’t mess with your DNA, plus no refrigeration. There are millions of people walking around with 1 dose of moderna awaiting the second one. So if 2 shots of moderna is 90% then 1 dose is 45%. So if I get a jnj shot tomorrow I’ll be in a better position than all the suckers waiting for their 2nd shot. People are so dumb. Not to mention the jnj vaccine is effective 51% against the new variant of the virus. JNJ for the win."
Better invest in weed.
"There is WEED, no need for JNJ medicine anymore....just joking.... but this must be the market thinking now..."

"Where are the people bragging about the dividends? please help me with the math, did it make sense to hold on to the stock instead of taking some profits out? oh wait the dividends payout.this is heading lower, way lower. not at buying opportunity until it gets to 2018 levels and/or it resolves legal issues."
"Holding a few shares , Just because its JNJ."
"JNJ ordered to pay 8 billion ? That's crazy. But they should pay something. And what about past shareholders who made money and are no longer shareholders. ALL of the shareholders who profited should be forced to cough up money. Its very easy to find out who owned shares and when. You shouldn't profit from hurting people. But I do agree, 8 billion is crazy, and the people on that jury should not be allowed to serve on any other jury, and should maybe be required to see a mental health professional. 8 bil shouldn't go to 1 person and a dozen law firms, it should go to all the people who grew breasts."
JNJ Q3 rev and income were lower than Q2. I don't know if current prices sustain.
I guess now their going to start paying this opens the flood gates no wonder the 5 billion buyback.
"Finally back to green today - absolutely ridiculous that SP would be down given the rollout of the single dose COVID vaccine. This is all good news and investors need to look ahead to EU approval, WHO approval, global rollout and ramp up of the vaccine - the US distribution will end up being a small % of the overall business for the this vaccine from JNJ."

"Over reaction to vaccine pause is over shadowing a great Q3 earnings beat - which absolutely counts more and is what investors should be looking at, not the Covid vaccine trial. This is a buying opportunity as the price will be back over $150 shortly - hang around"
Johnson & Johnson is down 4.92% to 160.84
"If I was in this stock it would be a very hard decision what to do with this news out today. Volume today has already exceeded its normal 10 day average and it's only an hour into trading, and the stock is getting hammered. One never know what can happen to any stock on any given day. Tough business 'sometimes' owning stocks."

"Sooooooo.....many novice investors last week said ""JNJ vaccine will be approved by the FDA so I'll buy it at $163 and make some lunch money"" Then the market spoke up and said, ""No ...No....it doesn't work that way"". Now all the novices are on the message boards crying about why didn't this stock go up $6/share like it was ""supposed"" to. Novices will sell at $150.........then we will go to $180."
For those of you waiting for an entry point...Happy Wednesday!
bought J&j today
A Healthy New Year to all. GLTA throughout 2020. Cheers to all the longs.
this is a great stock to buy
"I'm sorry but JNJ needs to accept the ""L"" on this one. When you make/sell a product that turns out to be as deadly as these opioids have then teaching a lesson is necessary. Hopefully all the other companies will pay a proportionate share. And hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again."
So much for some of JNJ longs' Reuters conspiracy; Reuters is reporting on the latest news!
One time charge is taken !! Now its time to repatriate and use it up !!
"$OCGN Why would anyone take the $JNJ vaccine once this is approved? Also works better than $PFE & $MRNA when it comes to the UK variant and other mutations! Covaxin is the best vaccine in the world right now! BUY, HOLD and upvote this post if you're holding LONG & STRONG!"

"For those naysayers on this board, the goal is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible . JNJ is a rapid deployment option to give masses of people some protection almost immediately.

"Jnj reported this AM. Beats but profit down 35 percent below last year as people delayed surgeries. After the move this week, I just do not see much upside. I was hoping to get a sizable position between $134-$136 when the stock was sliding last month. I started JNJ with two purchases below $140 but not as large as I wanted. I do not see a reason to buy additional shares or to let my shares go either at these levels."
Lol at the fallacy and false equivalency by cash. I guess all their other fallacies have failed too time for a new one
I think this will bottom out around $150 and then move.

"WHEW....I sold early! Such a great company, pays a nice dividend. I hate seeing JNJ go though this, esp. since I used talc since childhood.The article specifically implies that JNJ has failed in part in it's quality control and that MANY lawsuits will follow. We don't need for Co's. to be LAX in the health & safety of the product they manufacture!I'm NOT HOPING, but realistically, could these suits effect JNJ's bottom line? also...Think about the consumers wondering what's in the products that we use topically, will it harm them? & will new diseases/illnesses occur?THANKS goes to the tRump admin for his arrogant removal of regulations which is a huge part of the problem!"
"Fwiw, when you buy a no name biotech at 7 dollars, which is only trading at 7, and surviving BECAUSE of a contract with JNJ. When JNJ pulls out and your lil company crashes to 3. Use what little brains you may have and sell it. OR...you can watch it crumble to a buck. Instead of bragging about a 40 cent dead cat bounce and spending all your time railing on JNJ... as it accomplishes nothing other than to let everyone know what an idiot you are, try to actually LEARN proper risk management. One day you may accumulate enough money to manage others and even make a career of it. Glta and enjoy your weekend!"

Cleared 140 on to 150
new lawsuits on mesh also ? WOW
Onco pipeline looks awesome
Looks like we got the 3 black crows going right now. It happens to every stock. Last time was back in November and then JNJ went on a nice run afterwards. Don’t let emotions influence your decisions.
"For the first time in a couple of months I am seeing some pps softness. Could be the beginning of a correction to low 120s which might give us an opportunity to add more, jmho."

"Cordis is that a subsidiay of JNJA lawsuit has been filed against Cordis Corporation by a group of 12 people who were injured by defective TrapEase or OptEase Vena Cava Filters. Daily Hornet on January 22, 2019One of the plaintiffs is Robert E. B., a man from Texas who was implanted with the TrapEase IVC Filter in 2007. He is seeking compensation for injuries related to occlusion of the filter and thrombosis (blood clots). Furthermore, the filter can’t be removed.The 6th plaintiff is Samantha J. S., a woman from Alabama who was implanted with the OptEase IVC Filter on March 17, 2017. She underwent 2 failed retrieval attempts. The first attempt failed because the filter was embedded in her vein. The second attempt involved a complex dual approach, but the hook of the filter was embedded. There is additional evidence that she now suffers from chronic filter occlusion and was diagnosed with post-thrombotic syndrome.The 7th plaintiff is Ronald J. K., a man from Florida who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on March 26, 2008. He suffers from a filter that is occluded with blood clots.The 8th plaintiff is Jan George H., a man from New Jersey who was implanted with an OptEase IVC Filter in 2003. A CT scan of his abdomen shows that the filter has migrated up his vein, placing the top half of the filter above the kidney vein.The 10th plaintiff is Matthew T., a man from Alabama who was implanted with an OptEase IVC Filter on September 28, 2012. A CT scan of his abdomen shows that he suffers from an occlusion of the IVC Filter representing chronic thrombus (blood clots).The 11th plaintiff is Peggy S., a woman from Missouri who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on July 23, 2014. She underwent a successful complex retrieval of the filter via a dual approach. During the procedure, it was determined that the filter had fractured and one strut was left behind in the patient’s body.The 12th plaintiff is Virginia W., a woman from New York who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on November 1, 2010. A CT scan of her abdomen shows that all 6 prongs of the filter have perforated her vein. There is also evidence of a calcified blood clot (thrombus) in the filter.All of the plaintiffs have suffered life-threatening injuries and damages, and required extensive medical care and treatment. The plaintiffs suffered and will continue to suffer significant medical expenses, and pain and suffering, and other damages.Lawyers accuse Cordis Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, and Confluent Medical Technologies of negligence for selling defective medical devices and failing to warn about side effects.The lawsuit was filed on December 20, 2018 in the First Judicial District of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas — Case No. RG18933991."
What’s going on here!?!?
"Now is not the time to own JNJ. It's heading back to the lows of the day.The verdict removed uncertainty, but it still reflects a likely $15+ billion settlement, and tons of litigation in the process. Plus, wrongful death suits.The rise today is a shorting opportunity."
JNJ Vaccine ONE SHOT is 99.90 effective in keeping patients OUT of hospital !close to ZERO Death Rate !cutting down vaccine times by 50%

@stockguru - My projections and valuation has 130+ and definitely not going below 120 - that will be a floor
Two top JNJ pipelines drugs are now dead less than 2 weeks after they were included in the pharma update. Certainly JNJ had the negative info before the presentations and still presented it to the shareholders. I think JNj will be paying off quite a few lawyers over this as it is quite clear they committed securities fraud.
J&J and GlaxoSmithKline GSK gained FDA approval for the first two-drug HIV treatment in the United States!!!
146 shud b the bottom if it breaks that then 143 will be support. not an issue if you r in it for the income.
Can it hold $135 today?I don't think so. There many small institutions and traders who are chasing and playing DIV. They usually exit on ex-div to catch another fish. JNJ today price is in their hands but it will get better in coming days. $140 is in view and JNJ will get there in next few weeks.
next stop is 120
Think I’ll hold on to that $135 short. Sounds like many lawsuits to come.
I got burned by Sanofi when vaccine strength error made trial worthless. Volunteers received wrong strength of vaccine so antibodies not increased significantly in 60-80 age group. New trial in February with correct dose of vaccine. Expect vaccine ready 4th quarter. I'm waiting for information before investing in J&J. 
10 dollar drop? 20? Less than 100 soon

I think the market is not going to go down until DOW hit the new hight. I bought JNJ at 149.50 this morning and sold Sept 150 call at 5.25 and bought Sept 18 150 put for 1.25. I really don't care the direction at this point.
$150s around the bend
I will never have something thats not at least 95 percent effective or higher injected into my body. Thats like playing Russian Rulett.
"No new news is the best news for us, who knew."

ONE shot in the armis the way to go for the entire world !
Johnson Johnson needs to buy Boston Scientific before it turns into the next IBM that goes no where in the next 10 years.
Presumption of innocence. You're innocent until proven guilty. A company as large as JNJ should have snitches. So far none has come forward. Why is that? Were they paid off? Threatened? Or maybe they had nothing to hide in the first place. Read between the line folks.
"Unfortunately this stock will tumble hard today.. The trial got stopped since one of the patients got very sick due to the side effects of the vaccin. This doesn't surprise me since they were in a rush.. I just moved everysingle asset to PFE, they are the only one who didn't rush to find a vaccine."

Buy Moderna!! MRNA!!! Huge gains every day!!! The best vaccine company of them all!!! Big profits!!!! Big and huge win!!! Huuuuuge...
Does JNJ have a two dose study underway that might show they have a vaccine as good as the others currently available? Just wondering.
"An elite team of the worlds greatest doctors and researchers told the President they needed 2.5 Billion to fight corona.The liberals in Congress, who serve big pharma, passed 8.3 Billion. The left has been on the side of drugs, doctors, needless surgeries, gender change, needless vaccines, SDS's, gender fluidity, etc etc ever since Hillary was appointed by Bill to enrich them, for their contributions to his campaign. Part of our health care is badly needed. Much of it is terribly corrupt and hurtful to many many people."
HUGE surprise news coming Monday morning...
and up we go. get lost spammers.
Are you guys holding until a vaccine announcement or longer term until earnings from vaccine ?
"JNJ has developed a very good and important vaccine for COVID-19. The ongoing research to the one-shot (~72% effective in USA) is the optional booster shot---speculation is that will bring the effectiveness to about 90% . Also one can take Moderna routine later if one wishes, Normal refrigeration, easy distribution and fully effective in 14 days, preventing severe illness and hospitalization. This increases the worldwide supply dramatically.Remember that, ""the perfect is the enemy of the good""."
Buy NOW
JNJ will go down to $140 after vaccine news...will be a nice entry point to wait for!
"Soon above $140. Fair or not, this is how market reacts."
"Buy or add to JNJ position, forward PE ratio is 15. Management is seemingly doing a good job mitigating the risks. It's a bargain here!"

Another Gorsky Day. So far he's tying Ken Frazier at MRK for being a CEO in the Jeffrey Immeldt mold.
"We need to be vaccinated against COVID19 EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT 5/6 YEARS until we have something permanent inactivated vaccine. World is new with this disease and so are the treatments/vaccines. We have 3-4 vaccines (like $MRNA, $BNTX, $JNJ, $PFE) in the USA market so far and we are glad to have those with any cost! Hopefully, there will be additional 4/5 Vaccines coming in 3-12 months (like $NVAX,$OCGN Covaxin with Bharat Biotech); which is good for the consumers, more competitions will bring more effective vaccines with lower cost for us !! So my opinion is COVID19 vaccine market is huge and will have room for all the great companies for the next 5-6 years or more. Hold the horses and seat tight."
"Ok folks, here’s the deal. $AZN vaccine is now approved in U.K. It now shows efficacy of 70% after one dose and 95% or better after the second dose. It’s being MASS PRODUCED GLOBALLY, is shipped at normal refrigerator temps and AZN is selling it for NO PROFIT during the course of the pandemic. Total cost to make a full dose (two doses) is just $6 and that’s what they are selling it for. No adverse allergic reactions occurred in any of the trials.What all of this shows is this new messenger RNA technology being used by MRNA and $PFE is WORSE than the existing vaccine technology. The costs to manufacture these vaccines using messenger RNA is TOO HIGH. It’s show NO BENEFIT at all over existing, tried and true, vaccine technology. MRNA share price will be CRASHING as a result. Things will only get worse for them once $JNJ rolls out their SINGLE DOSE vaccine. I will continue to short this stock back down to $60. The great news for all is that AZN has the vaccine for the MASSES. This will led to a return of life back to normal by spring, early summer.Enjoy!"
Did some research and found out that the trials-Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is being studied as a single- and two-dose adenovirus-based vaccine. Depending on the results of the trial result it could be one or the other.
1200 separate jury trials? What nuts?! I hope they fight this back.

"Ashley did you check this one out?????? Let me know what you thinkLevaquin Users Sue J&J for $800M for Hiding Side EffectsBy Michelle LlamasThis page features3 Cited Research ArticlesLast modified: June 5, 2018Elderly man with chest pain and wifeFive former Levaquin users filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and its Janssen unit claiming the drug giant deliberately downplayed side effects of the medication to boost profits. The plaintiffs’ lawsuit said J&J mislabeled and misbranded the popular antibiotic, causing “significant harm and/or death to consumers of Levaquin, including plaintiffs.”In addition to J&J, the plaintiffs name additional defendants, including former FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg. The suit falls under the under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act, the law used to prosecute organized crime. Plaintiffs seek more than $800 million, about $120 million in compensatory damages and around $750 million in punitive damages — damages meant to punish companies and discourage the same kind of behavior in the future, according to Fierce Pharma.The plaintiff’s attorney, Larry Klayman, argues that the defendants worked together to mislabel and misbrand Levaquin. Doctors use Levaquin and other drugs in the same class called fluoroquinolones to treat bacterial infections. They are popular because they treat a wide variety of illnesses from urinary tract to respiratory infections.In November 2015, the FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (ADMAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee called for a black box warning, the agency’s strongest warning, for all fluoroquinolones.The class of drugs is linked to several disturbing side effects, including tendon damage, peripheral neuropathy, heart problems and skin conditions.“We … believe our actions regarding the medicine have been appropriate, responsible and in the best interests of patients,” J&J told FiercePharma in an email.Did you suffer side effects from antibiotics like Levaquin?"

The price dropping in the record market is very suspicious. This is the first time that I've seen that JNJ dropped one or two days before EX-DIV day. Something is going on and JNJ is keeping it secret until big guys unload their shares. Volume is larger than usual too.
JNJ will reopen AMERICA by this summer.................................Saving lives and bringing economy back to normal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If it goes above $127 then we are in business.
It is about time to pay for drug dealers and kingpin. The past finally catching up and do not let these murders getting away.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/judge-rules-against-johnson-johnson-in-landmark-opioid-case-in-oklahoma.html
JNJ’s single dose vaccine will likely become the market share front runner for treating Covid-19 globally.
I think the USA bought to much of the JNJ vaccine - you know the one that works the least - and now they are pumping it
The shareholders are sooo desperate here. Of what I said wasn’t truth they would ignore me.
"There are doctors in prison for selling opioids in mass quantities to make millions of dollars off of drug dependent people. JNJ fraudulently marketing opioids per an Oklahoma judge which I am sure harmed many people. The only difference is people perceive this company as having a ""strong balance sheet"" and they want to make money off of them. At the end of the day, no one will care about their precious balance sheet. They will simply add up all of the harm they have done with asbesto, opioids, Risperdal, etc. etc etc. It will catch up with them eventually! Thank goodness Target, Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid and others are doing what JNJ would not and are pulling this talcum powder poison from the shelves."
JNJ'S failures in Robotic simp aly widensnd deepens the moat around ISRG THANKS

I wouldn’t touch this stock for awhile. There is going to be so much legal cases against them for a long time after their confession...
"Can you imagine if the JNJ Vaccine proves to be successful? OMG, life goes back to normal for humankind. Needless to say, JNJ stock will shoot to the moon. Let us pray."
"This is going to prove to be hoax. Highly likely a few hundred counterfeit bottles made in China got into the pipeline and some ended up in the US. In fact, the fact that the container in question is a counterfeit could be announced tomorrow AM and the stock could open at 135. JNJ is one of the more ethically run and revered American companies and brands and nothing has changed. They just announces fantastic earnings. We are heading to 150."
"Question for the group , looking to get into JNJ or AMGN. Any thoughts long term ?"
"This taken from the JNJ website. Read the harsh words being used by JNJ. I believe the company, not the Reuters hack piece with questionable motives IMO.Statement on Reuters Talc ArticleNew Brunswick, NJ (December 14, 2018) -- Johnson & Johnson today issued the following statement regarding speculation about the safety of our products.The Reuters article is one-sided, false, and inflammatory. Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder is safe and asbestos-free. Studies of more than 100,000 men and women show that talc does not cause cancer or asbestos-related disease. Thousands of independent tests by regulators and the world’s leading labs prove our baby powder has never contained asbestos. Johnson & Johnson will continue to defend the safety of our product. For the truth and facts about talc, please go to www.factsabouttalc.com.The Reuters article is wrong in three key areas:The article ignores that thousands of tests by J&J, regulators, leading independent labs, and academic institutions have repeatedly shown that our talc does not contain asbestos.The article ignores that J&J has cooperated fully and openly with the U.S. FDA and other global regulators, providing them with all the information they requested over decades. We have also made our cosmetic talc mines and processed talc available to regulators for testing. Regulators have tested both, and they have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.The article ignores that J&J has always used the most advanced testing methods available to confirm that our cosmetic talc does not contain asbestos. Every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free."
"I am really disappointed in this stock but continue to hold. I bought this and V the same day. V is up 86%, JNJ 25%."
Ex dividend date coming up soon for JnJ ! Load up
Mainstream just announced what has already been the neg. head line.BUY NOW
So J&J wants to dump Ingram. All over the social media about a boycott of any company that has. Maybe J&J should confer with Kellogg's about consumer reaction.
This has 8-10 point move by the end of July
That was the most obvious buying opportunity I've seen in awhile. There was not a rational explanation for the drop post earnings.
"Actelion price is a mystery to me.Taking annual revenue and applying an average 5 multiple yields a value $9.45B market cap. Given that J&J is not getting the R&D, it's probably not realistic to use a market average multiple and a 3.5 multiple is probably fairer. Thatgives a market cap of $6.75B.However, let's throw logic to the winds and assume a massive 10 multiple. Now we get a completely irrational $19BWe're still nowhere near $30BCan anyone explain the numbers in this deal?"
I wonder if they are buying Auris due to the health ramifications of Esketamine….
$180s cometh
"I'm calling it here first. If JNJ does indeed invent THE vaccine, I expect the stock price to go up by $100 in 10 days or less. GLTA"
Just SOLD....headed to under $90
Should I buy above $50 or wait for $35?
This is a Word beater single shot vaccine with only cool storage required. Even Pfizer and Moderna are not 72% after 1st dose. They are only 52% and they were tested Worldwide. JNJ is proceeding with a 2 dose study as well
"nice little run up today,it's overdue to break out"
Appears JNJ will soon be making money off of Imetelstat in Europe. They are hiring a pricing specialist now.
Great day for humanity. Thank you JNJ.
I see this at 145 by next Friday.
"This is huge, buckle up for another 20 +"
I kmow he has his fault everyone does but president trump is 100 percent looking out for the united states of America....
Why not up more on vaccine news?
Like the JNJ earning report and decide to add to long positions by selling put option AUG 16 $125 for $0.75 per share to acquire shares for $125 if by expiring date it hits the price. Good luck longs.
OH BOY!Blood bath tomorrow..
"We need to be vaccinated against COVID19 EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT 5/6 YEARS until we have something permanent inactivated vaccine. World is new with this disease and so are the treatments/vaccines. We have 3 vaccines (like $MRNA, $PFE/$BNTX, $JNJ, ) in the USA market under EUA so far and we are glad to have those at any cost! Hopefully, there will be additional 4/5 Vaccines coming in 2-12 months (like $OCGN COVAXIN with 81% efficacy); which is good for the consumers, more competitions will bring more effective vaccines with lower cost for us !! So my opinion is COVID19 vaccine market is huge and will have room for all the great companies for the next 5-6 years or more. Hold the horses and sit tight."
The ambulance chasing lawyers are not finished stealing from the company and shareholders. Not good news.
VXRT has a durable COVID19 oral tablet vaccine! It is safer and durable!
$542.20 in dividends today. Thanks JNJ :)
Is PE really 235?
Didn’t sell off ex-dividend. Good sign.
200million vaccine deal with EU...bustn
JNJ is one of the best American companies. JNJ is a great buy and hold stock.
"so, I see JNJ at low $130 and $130 is a strong support."
So steady but really think it is overdue to breakout and get back to $145 - $150 levels.
"When the sheep run for the hills,The wolves stay to rob their houses.I've just added to my position in jnj."
JNJ proves one again the value of buying and holding a quality stock in good times and difficult ones like the current situation we find ourselves in today. JNJ has almost made it back to where it closed on February 24th. Pretty impressive given the circumstances.JNJ. Long & Strong!
J&J should cover their short in GERN. They have had plenty of time to buy cheap shares. Why do they continue to hide information like this about GERN?
Imo everyone in this world should demand Johnson and Johnson pulled their stuff off the shelves
Time to short
"Hi there,Anyone does see the dividend payout in his/her account?It is supposed to be deposited today (9/10/18) based on Yahoo statistic but I don't see it in my account."
Why has JNJ been languishing? Very disappointing performance recently.
Not the smartest trade I ever made.
Any predictions on JNJ price by next week???
up 30 today watch
If you own jnj doesn't it make sense to own gern am I missing something here?
I'll buy this kind of dip - all day.... long
Just bought 200 more shares at $130.85. Will buy another 200 if it drops below 130. I have seen JNJ go up and down over the last 25 years. If you're a long term investor and you don't see this as a buying opportunity then you are not an investor you're just trying to make a fast buck like most retail investors. JNJ is not and never will be a day trade stock. GL to all longs. It's a tuff day but if you weren't planning on selling your shares today try to hang in. Tomorrow is a new day.
"Yes I agree with Edg. I work in a hospital and have been for 35 years. Doctors due become drug addicts, alcoholics, and whatever else. Doctors are not immune to becoming addicts. 18 million alcoholics in this country. This is why you should never have a surgery on Monday after the Docs are partying on the weekends. I know plenty who do. Had on anesthesiologist years ago on a Monday attempt to give a spinal block and shoved the needle into her aorta which killed her. Cost the hospital 10 million. Lawyers are the only people who make money off of any big lawsuit."
"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a 6.3% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, from $0.95 per share to $1.01 per share."
Great value at this price. Buying more.
LIKE SAY TIME TO BUY SRNE
Is $200 possible by March?
The problem with todays investors is they want instant gratification - in this case they would prefer that JNJ used the 30B for stock repurchase instead of 15% increase in R and D. They don't look for the long term so they sold off.
FOR all of you who bought those PUTS ! OUCH ! They will be ZERO tomorrow
If J& J has the miracle ￼vaccine then their stock will skyrocket.
This is freedom of speech!
"University of Washington (UW) created a potential vaccine that fits every criteria needed to vaccinate the world. Trump bought vaccines from another company already from Europe for some reason... It sure sounds like the UW vaccine is elite choice. There are going to be dozens of vaccines to choose from it sounds like, which one is actually the best for Americans, might not be the best for businesses. UW vaccine needs to be #1 candidate as it can be stored room temp, 1 dose needed plus other points hits nail on the head all around. Side effects on humans you cant possibly know for years as there are so many different cases to come."
I like dogs but this one right now sure has a lot of fleas. When will it start to rise again?
Great company bad times and bad stock for the foreseeable future. In this bear market all get slaughtered. JNJ will be at $100 by end of 1st Quarter. The ramifications of the law suits and pending litigation will take a toll on its earnings.
Strong sell. 
Deborah do you think this will lead to more lawsuits about the antibiotic?
"Well there are facts, and then there is rampant negative opinion. I suspect JNJ gets beat down some more, but it has made it on my radar to consider once I hear overwhelming negative bias. PE is rather high tho, even now"
Good chance to add more imho
ONE SHOT and done will speed up global recovery time by 50%
"Which company will be the first to cure a blood cancer -melanoma, non-Hoskins lymphoma, leukemia? Leaders are JNJ, ABBV, AZN, NVS, BMY or a smaller bio?"
JNJ will have more bad news and stocks will drop to $110.
We're at the same price as late 2017. this is pathetic! Do a post we may claim Bankruptcy and we may shoot to $300.
Is the dividend increase still a possibility?
"Upside down head and shoulders has been formed, you already know I bought some today"
"I have just read the Reuters article published today the 9th April. regarding jnj's marketing of baby powder to minority groups. Nothing apart from contrived innuendo it is pathethic!!!talk about reaching,this piece by Reuters is offensive."
"I started following ""awesomestokcalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
Does anyone think this stock will go above $145 by the end of the year?
Hey the Apes running AMC check out Trey YouTube on Gamma squeeze AMC next Game stop rack em up help us Apes... We need you together we are strong fun board we were all watching it hard together Friday 8.01 we did it historical epic play!
"The 3, 5, and 10 year outlooks for JNJ have not changed in the last 24 hours. Buy the dip."
Does anyone know how many vaccines J and J currently has licensed globally? I didn’t realize they were a major player in this space.
You guys should know these legacy large cap stocks don’t go up a lot on good news
I can see this stock hitting its low of the year. And probably fairly quickly particularly if more bad news comes out like that of today. This is not good.
Will JNJ be above today’s price ($163) by Feb 15th? I like the track record of the company and potential vaccine catalyst but worried about litigation overhang and potential government price regulation. Do you recommend that I invest? (Thumbs up/thumbs down).
Today is one of only seven trading days in the past year with less than 4 million shares traded.
you cant make money when your company gives out paychecks to management! and the stock hoders are told ! yall don't matter! that's why I sold for Mars! get paid each week and share holders get screwed
Anyone think we are going to $160?
"kristopher,shouldn't you be in the gym fantasizing?"
I’m out until the dust settles
why is it taking four days to figure out what is going on with one person who had an adverse reaction?
Data must look very very good on vaccine
The real drug cartels right here.
JNJ to pay $4B over 18 years to settle opioid lawsuits. That is nothing. $222M/yr
"Does a vaccine exist to combat the common cold? Nope. The only thing you can do is alleviate the symptoms. The same will go for the coronavirus, aka another form of the common cold. Any happy talk about a vaccine is just that. Buy JNJ because it's a great company and not on the hopes they come up with a vaccine for the coronavirus."
"kristopher,still awake?"
"I never sell my JNJ shares, dividend company and diverse books of business. Expecting great earnings and update on vaccine work."
Buy at opening
Sold my jnj bought insg. So glad
$SPHS $mdt $JnJ $REGN $3 Billions BO on $SPHS soon...
This stock is a screaming buy
once jnj vaccine approved bang major game changer.
Insane to think that long term this company won’t be in great shape. Take the short term blinders off
JnJ much better than nvax
$100 will NOT hold. Sell.
Clearly the news on in production delay is very troublesome and disappointing. We thought they had started production in risk 6 months ago. Lost 2 month in sales and future market share.
I love these trolls. What a sad life they all must live. Do they really think that their toxic comments are going to have any real meaning effect on JNJ. Happy New Year to all the JNJ longs.
"JNJ is a SELL. Waiting for allpotential litigation to get settled. Better opportunities elsewhere now...GSK, GILD, etc"
"We should be @ 150.00""ssssssssssssssssssssss now"
Cancer stock deserves to crash. Lol Deborah actually thinks that it’s a conspiracy and that the media only writes about when JandJ loses a case.
Tank City !
we need news on that second shot....surprised that J&J didn't do a better job with this vaccine vs Pfizer and Moderna....who do they hire the left overs???? I went in believing they would hit it but was hammered as I was wrong about their expertise. Boolean
"Talcum powder is made from talc, but JNJ R&D decided to add some asbestos.Why?"
j&j comes out with more news this week?
Super cool
$121 low from December here we go
This dip is a gift for those who need to average down or just want to add more to your portfolio. Nothing has changed fundamentally that will affect them moving forward. Ignore the daily BS.
Quietly JNJ going with VXRT 100% vested in oral pill vaccine.
"JNJ's one shot vaccine is gaining acceptance Worldwide. JNJ is still completing its 2 dose study, but even one dose will lead to herd immunity and no more hospitalizations."
How far can this stock go? It is almost at its high and it seems like this is just the beginning.
It looks like this is turning out to be a bloodbath and not just for JNJ but for many pharmaceuticals. Will we see $120....$115.....$110.....or perhaps even lower?
Slow and steady............................shorties better cover.
is bottom forming?

OH no the stock is up today. The trolls are hiding. They're as bad as Trump. Cheery picking the news. Have a good weekend all longs.

"Its Big Coronavirus Vaccine News?The clock is definitely ticking.Keith SpeightsKeith Speights(TMFFishBiz)Jan 26, 2021 at 6:09AMAuthor BioThe biggest healthcare company in the world has some really big news on the way. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) should announce results from a late-stage study of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, JNJ-78436735, any day now.What makes J&J's results so highly anticipated is that its vaccine requires only a single dose instead of two doses as coronavirus vaccines already on the market require. This could give J&J a significant competitive advantage over its rivals.With a potentially momentous announcement imminent, should you buy Johnson & Johnson stock before the big news hits? The answer is a little complicated.Hourglass next to a dollar signIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Playing devil's advocateLet's first make the case against buying shares of J&J. Probably the most compelling reason not to plunge in now is that there's a real possibility that the results for JNJ-78436735 might not be as good as hoped.J&J's COVID-19 vaccine candidate could prove to be both safe and effective in late-stage testing, yet still fail to impress investors. Pfizer and Moderna have set the efficacy bar very high. If the single-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 doesn't at least deliver efficacy of 80% or higher, I suspect the vaccine could be seen as a disappointment.Keep in mind, also, that Johnson & Johnson has committed to selling JNJ-78436735 at cost during the pandemic. Even if the vaccine passes its late-stage testing with flying colors, it's going to be a while before J&J's bottom line receives a boost. J&J's sheer size also works against it. Successful late-stage results for a COVID-19 vaccine would provide a major catalyst for smaller biotech stocks. However, Johnson & Johnson generates more than $80 billion in annual revenue already. A new blockbuster product would be nice for the healthcare giant, but isn't likely to move the needle enough to cause its shares to skyrocket.The other side of the storySure, the late-stage results for JNJ-78436735 could be disappointing. However, there are reasons to expect good news. For example, J&J reported results from its phase 1/2a study that showed neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were produced in more than 90% of participants 29 days after receiving a single dose of the vaccine. A full 100% of participants between the ages of 18 and 55 had neutralizing antibodies at day 57. This bodes well for the prospects that JNJ-78436735 could achieve a high efficacy. I wouldn't be overly concerned about J&J's decision to not make a profit from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, either. The company should have plenty of opportunities to generate significant profits over the long run from JNJ-78436735, especially if COVID-19 requires annual booster shots.But what about the argument that even positive results for JNJ-78436735 won't be enough to provide a solid catalyst for J&J's shares? My response is that it depends on the data. If J&J's vaccine has a high efficacy with a single dose, I wouldn't underestimate how excited investors could be on the news.A nuanced answerSo should you buy Johnson & Johnson stock before its big COVID vaccine news? I think the best answer to the question is a nuanced one.If you're looking for aggressive growth, J&J probably isn't going to be a great pick for you even if JNJ-7843673 is a rousing success story. However, if you're a more conservative investor, the stock could be quite attractive regardless of how good the late-stage results for J&J's COVID-19 vaccine are."
"REAL NEWS!!! Geron's Imetelstat Hits A Grand Slam, But The Rally Is Just Beginning https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157973?source=ansh $GERN, $ABBV, $CELG, $JNJ"
Many things we consume could be linked to cancer. i think what JNJ is saying is that there is no coralation to baby powder and cancer. My question to jurors how can you determine if baby powder itself caused the cancer. Seems impossible to make that determination. As a reslut many of these lawsuits have been overturned during the appeal process. That should tell you what you need to know.
JNJ will come out the winner when all other competition is gone. Thanks to all other companies going bankrupt. JNJ only has 1% of the OPIOID market.

"I have to tell these patients and their lawyers get a sign that says: "" help me with my sickness"" instead of going to cheating a company that its products is as safe as many products in the market. People get sick in many ways and mostly are genetic. Breast cancer is an example and it cannot be blamed on a company that does many tests meticulously. After all, there FDA out there that does testing regularly without JNJ involved and FDA approves the products based on scientific facts not a layer that speaks from it bottom. Why patients go after FDA?"
Does anyone know when Ketamine may be FDA approved? ...The nasal antidepressant drug. A lot of interest in this new approach to major depression. It may change the world. Change many brains and you change the world. Be well. JC
Still $100 overvalued per share using discounted cash flow analysis.
Phara was out of favor today. Tomorrow's a new day. GLTAL.
So I guess if JNJ missed and announced lower expectations people would be buying.
The only thing I noticed that may have concerned analysts was that JNJ raised sales guidance but did not raise earnings or EPS guidance for the year. So @Iamdog doesn't have a clue what he is talking about when he states JNJ is not selling more. They are. However earnings seems to be flat. Either way very disappointed in today's market reaction to an otherwise fantastic earnings report.
What is the real answer on JNJ vacine? Is the company seling the vacine or giving it away for free for humanatarium reasons. The price of JNJ is dropping.
"As you know French and German authorities not recommended $AZN Covid-19 vaccine for the adults over 65 and $JNJ results was only 66% effective in preventing Covid-19 globally. $MRNA has better picture of manufacturing capabilities compared to JNJ and AZN. You also know NVAX still in the process of getting approval and so on but it is not clear when it can start to distribute and/or still effective on South Africa variant or any future variants is questionable?, so almost all vaccines are facing with big problems, but very far from the $MRNA. Therefore we are having a piece of gold in your hand keep it real."
reversal? haha... wishful thinking
Congratulations JNJ for inventing the most promising vaccine for World use. Most of the World cannot cope with a 2 dose vaccine that requires very cold temperatures.
JNJ will FLOOD the world with ONE SHOT Vaccines soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!great News........................

I want to see a chart of people drinking Coca Cola daily and those who used JNJ baby powder who both have ovarian cancer and see how that compares. Or a chart of people in the US who have ovarian cancer and those who used JnJ powder that have ovaria cancer. How about a chart of women who used hair spray daily and had ovarian cancer and those who used JNJ powder. There have to be more studies and you just can't convince me (as a woman) that using baby powder causes ovarian cancer. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSES CANCER OR THE PHARMA COMPANIES WOULD BE STOPPING IT WITH A NEW MED.
"The reaction to JNJ earnings is totally absurd. JNJ beats on revenues. JNJ beats on EPS. JNJ raised guidance. So basically the stock plunges from $152.50 to 146.50 because of a lauded on covid 19 trials? Are you kidding me? JNJ is developing the vaccine at ZERO MARGIN. It has no impact on earnings anyway. Anyhow I had 500 shares I bought in the $138-139 area and added today at $146.50. BTW, since ear I gs I seen 4 buy rev for JNJ with higher price targets so I have no idea why people are selling JNJ at this point. Incredible imho."

The minute JNJ goes down a bit...like yesterday the trolls assume JNJ is going to tank. What I don't understand is how miserable these people must be with their lives to spend it spewing negative comments about a stock like JNJ. If you're short JNJ stock great. Good luck.
Big pharma stocks are peaked. Stock market is tired. No way to buy at this point.
Another down day¥£&$@
JNJ may announce phase 1 or 2 of the new vaccine at any time and the stock will be over $160 in a blink.
where is J&J headed? Keep holding back adding
Idk why the celebration for ah pop on a bad judgement. This opens them up to being sued and sets precedent. Let's see what happens after everyone has the divi locked in and what happens tomorrow.
"Impact from lower taxes, weaker dollar, Accretive effect of acquisition all should help upcoming earnings. Along with the upcoming expectations of healthy dividend increase, stock should start moving again. I wouldn't be surprised to see upper 140's by end of April, Long and strong."
Up or down? Zacks said JNJ lowered 2018 sale forecast?
Nobody will want this vaccine
Talc is banned in Europe for a reason. JJ covered up for years like Big Tobacco. 0
ADIL is the next move 
JNJ closed at all time high last week.That is bullish. No bull market complete without JNJ participating in it. I expect a run to 180.
Let it be...Go you.tube: one day
Buy PFE
I’m curious about whether a company like JnJ is going to do well this summer when families increase in size due to the quarantine. Anyone’s thoughts?
"Why is jnj stock going up when they stated they are not making a profit on vaccine. Not a rhetorical question, I am curios."
The recent run will be ended today.
"The White House virus staff was notified of HCQ over 3 weeks ago. Results in 6 days they were told. 100% cure rate. Today, 3 weeks later, some tests were stopped, some in progress, some never started. Its obvious big pharma is colluding to stop this. Big pharma had big plans for hillaries victory. They've been waiting and plotting for something to happen, to steal trillions from the world. They must be stopped. They are keeping people from at least feeling better, to even helping them die. Lets get a dam test done. Its way over due. Maybe some anchor will ask when in the world will we see an overdue report ?"
He’s either lying or a sociopath. Who vehemently defends a company that it’s own memos admits it sold a cancerous product. Then says stuff like “I’ve learned in life not to blame others and take responsibility”. Lol so if a company without you knowing starts filling your food with lead and radioactive byproducts you should .just “take responsibility” lol
Anyone have views on the potential revenue stream for Janssen once fully in market for a Hepatitis B cure? How many Billions? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arrowhead-collaborator-janssen-begins-reef-113000711.html
"Everything now in the stock market is short, it needs to be revised or CRASH is eminent, well buy Gold or Bitcoin"
"green now, but it will go down tomorrow."
This is the biggest dog in my port. i bought it because the were one of the major beneficiaries from tax bill and I figured they would buy back shares and at least eek out a small gain while giving out that great dividend. So why do people here think it will go up?
Added more shares today on the recent pullback!
"GALT has approved patents to support the development for treating over 20 cancers, and approval by the FDA to start phase 3 for a Nash drug, and a combination trial that makes keytruda twice as good in 1/8 the time and significantly improve safety, Imo this stock is way under value at $3.94 and should be trading more than twice its current value."
"The increasing trend towards healthier lifestyle choices, in all age groups in N. America where the highest pharmaceuticals use is globally, inc. people exercising more, counting their steps with their fitbit bands, eating more fruits and vegs, and less saturated fat but more healthy fats such as omega threes found in flax, fish and other sources, ect..All means. there will increasingly be less demand for pharmaceuticals as people are healthier which JNJ is placing much of their revenue growth hopes on. I myself lowered my bad cholesterol the LDL to 1.90 from 2.90 by simply making healthier dietary choices inc.eating no deep fried foods or meat all which increase arterial plaque, and exercise regularly. Therefore I did not need any pharmaceuticals my blood pressure and cholesterol normalized on their own. All stats I have looked at via consumer trends re: health care indicate people are increasingly choosing healthier lifestyle choices and focusing on prevention."
Tired of JNJ under performance. JNJ needs real changes in the company. JNJ needs to give more freedom to its subsidiaries to innovate instead of bug them with outdated JNJ technology.
JNJ is huge and will always produce profits for people with the dividend and the GOV just announced that people should start receiving JNJ vaccine asap

No demand.Straigt down from here.
THANKS TO J&J and last Admin.
Ok - so fda advisory committee moments away from recommending approval of nasal ketamine. Dont stock people tune in for that???
seriouslt guys. this is ridiculous that company knew and did not do anything for decades. they should be fined 100b atleast
Looks like this is going to fall right through $150 tomorrow. Depending on how the market finishes the week. Next week we could test the previous bottom of $144 and if we break that than possibly $137. Right now a lot of big name stocks are retesting their previous 6 month price. I hope We get a turnaround next week after this brutal 2 week correction.
"Lettuce recall for E. Coli contamination is obvious, hower talc contaminated with asbestos is hard to detect.JNJ ignored doing its best since it cost money. JNJ is so stingy that stingy is focus on profit that people lives."

TRUMP JUST MENTIONED J&J!!!
I'm back to >100% up in JNJ price- original buys plus reinvested divs over the years... not too shabby.
Watching the CFO interview on yahoo was pretty powerful. This is an amazing company. Great American brand that truly makes a difference in the world. kudos to all who accumulated under 130. Of course in hindsight I wish I bought more.
Thank you for the rich dividend......
If JNJ's vaccine reduces the effects of COVID infection to that of a common cold.........then that's all that matters. JNJ is a STRONG BUY.
Time to drop
140 here we come
"The last time this stock lost this much value in one day was Monday, March 23rd, in the eye of the covid purge. It regained 90% of it's losses the next day, and proceeded to jump from there."
Uh....JNJ up big....
"BTW for all the ""hair on fire"" JNJ doubters the Pharma industry has always been heavily litigated. It sort of comes with the territory. So the lawsuits although headline grabbing is nothing new to JNJ and the industry as a whole. It certainly doesn't impact sales as we have just seen in Q3. They are still selling JNJ baby powder everyday, and the antipsychotic drug Risperdal is consider by the world health organization as a preferred drug in the field. So all the ambulance chasers can keep chasing their tails. GL to all JNJ longs."
"Moody's latest article on JNJ, more rocks thrown"

Terrible lawyers hired by J&J. This is a $90 stock after this news.

Will JNJ go up $133 tomorrow?
"talc lawsuits arent ""BS"" if jnj is paying settlements that are ongoing!!"
"Expecting a bit of a rally by close, weekend should see a bit of a pop after they approve for use. I bought 50 more close to days low"
I’ve backed up the truck on JNJ stock. I already own it and added more shares.
"I bought JNJ to be a long term holder. Being new to JNJ, is this kind of news normal to JNJ? or is it happening first time or second time? when I was buying I read about JNJ being sued in India for talcum powder."
JNJ sounds very low to me.
See you in appeals court where JNJ will prevail.
I would love to see JNJ either acquire or partner with a tiny biotech symbol ( the name is a real tongue twister) NNVC. They have the most unique concept in treating diseases. Their outside the box thinking completely bypasses the immune system. This could really be a game changer. They explain it very clearly on their website.
"This is not at all surprising. With all the suits pending and all ready occurring, some new supposed revelations was almost a given. Yes, the price will probably drop some more, however, it may rebound based upon what the response to this new allegation is."
Why is it going down?
this is a $200.00 stock
I'm running short on cash so headed to bank to change my $20 bill for two 10's.

"Just relax, add shares as feasible, collect the nice dividend stream, sleep well knowing JNJ is a great American brand. JNJ has deep pockets to fight off the ambulance chasers. We all grew up using and benefiting from JNJ products. The average American has JNJ’s back!"
Why the hex is there no PR about Janssen's phase 3 trial for covid-19 vaccine which just got registered today??!?
Imagine all the lawsuits across the nation! Lawyers are already contacting everyone they can on info commercials! Have you ever used baby powder? The law office of Mud & Grimes can get you well deserved $$$ from J & J!! I can see it now! What a PR nightmare for JJ!! Going under $99 a share by Monday!!!! SELL Quickly!!!!!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/johnson-johnson-appeal-flawed-opioid-205900687.html.
"Q1 2018 report Q1 2018 numbers exceeded expectation of investors but some analysts tried to spin negativity based on small matters while ignoring real matters.Lets review and analyze them: 1- Baby Care dropped in US. True but analysts made so much noise for a small matter. First, Baby Care was positive or flat overall YOY in spite of constant news and article about baby power. US sale dropped by a drop like $16mm but internationally gained $18mm. So, this is nothing to make noise for revenue of $20.1B for the quarter that exceeded by $600mm from the Q1 estimate. 2- Ramicade revenue went down by $283 mm YOY because of generic. First, Ramicade still producing as a blockbuster for JNJ but the company is replacing it with other drugs. J&J has a few other drugs in IMMUNOLOGY that compensated for Ramicade and more. Stelara gained $238 mm YOY, Simponi/Simponi Aria gained $90 MM YOY and finally other new drugs gained $66 mm YOY for total of $394 mm or $111 mm higher than last year Q1 in IMMUNOLOGY. Nobody expects Remicade to produce for good. A good company replace it and that is exactly what JNJ is doing. So, why analysts don't see this clear fact? 3- Zytiga may go generic in 2019. So what? JNJ has recently expanded its labels and that's why the revenue went up by 62% ($332 mm)YOY. These new labels cannot go generic and JNJ is the only one with right to sell. So, most of Zytiga rev comes from recent labels expansion that belong to JNJ only and generic cannot touch them for several years. After all, in ONCOLOGY, JNJ is making tones of new money. The sector gained over $717 mm YOY because of Darzalex and Imbruvica and Valcade. New Sector PULMONARY gained $587 mm YOY or new money. Vision Care added $317 mm new money. One must be blind to ignore all these progresses especially new drugs that have been approved or will be approved like ERLEADA."

"$DIS, $JNJ, $PG, $CELG, $WMT, $GILD, $AGN,$KHC, $IBM, are so cheap I can't buy enough of them. I am keep selling out of money put on each of them for weeks now and printing good money week after week even while they go slowly down. I am now buying bunch but that also put me at risk to get into Margin use as I have short out of money puts as well( Not worry as I will sell calls to cover cost of interest and still print profit) If I have patience I would make thousands investing here & holding for few years out. Dividend and profit would be huge. (I am making lot of money still but all money is short term and required lot of time to monitor) This is very limited risk investment out there. Buy before they move higher."
Down in the gutters like JandJ should be. Nice to see bad behaviour being punished Ed
140.00 soon..........................
"cup with a handle formed, bullish to $150?"
earnings?
"J&J announces solid growth results with an increase in dividend above expectations - then an increase in outlook as well, deep pipeline of new drugs coming and a highly diversified business - and the share price keeps dropping???? What does a company have to do any better?? Investors are bring idiots for selling J&J"
Bullish close. Let's see if we can hit $130 at the end of the week.
This company has no forward thinking management!
I bought under $129 the other day. Way too cheap at that level with dividend increase coming soon. JNJ is a must own in the pharma category. You get the benefit of med devices and consumer products as well
Why the big drop today?
Can anyone who actually knows something please give us an approximate estimate how much this stock will go up with emergency approval! Thanks so much!! ( I'm currently holding 1300 of JNJ and looking for some guidance.)
Why are we down today?
Better buckle up before the open. Upgrades point north Started at $4 now up to $13. Love this OCGN more than $PFE or $JNJ
Class Action?

Does anyone know when the dividends will be paid
JNJ has shown time snd time again that its legal team will successfully ward off these bullies. JNJ will march on swatting aside these annoyances. Smart investors will buy at these moments and hold for ever.
Ouch the shareholders are so afraid
When will this board split the stock?
 These are crimes against Humanity￼ https://www.globalresearch.ca/video-crimes-against-humanity-the-german-corona-investigation/5725795
I'm buying off this dip today. $ 152.05
JNJ has realized that it needs to do some changes which is very encouraging. If JNJ mentality and culture has changed to take more risks and put people with vision in charge then recovery will start from this point.
what a crazy country... I should use the S word. The jury probably can't understand what a Billion is. To award that kind of money just really make them look Stupid. There is the S word. I have 0 JNJ shares but some CELG. May be all Pharmas should just leave the US. And people are wondering why healthcare is so expensive in the US.
So much for gains
this stunt brought to you by somebody covering their short position.
it is 12noon over here nearly lunch time Saturday 5th January.
why is this still low ?
When people overreact that is the best time to buy. I added a little to my life long position before the end of the close.
jnj took no money overseas too many law suits and they just started it will go to 110 by end on month
"will y'all look at the 5 yr chart please. every time JNJ trades above 140, it sells off. 7 times it got over $140 and each time they sell it off. something hits the news tape and they bang it. uncanny how it happens..."
"Just looking at this stock from its inception, it is an incredibly upward mobile stock, that seems to have weathered recessions including the plunge we just experienced, and seems to be an excellent long term hold even at the current price"
This looks ready to rip tomorrow. I’m in with calls
JNJ has upgrades all over the place
I really wish $150 would become a floor. Upward and onward. Let's go!
Now the latest judgement is for 8 billion for one individual lawsuit. Unbelievable. Why not just make it 8 trillion. The litigation in this country is so out of control. Great for the parasites and their clients but bad for anybody doing business.

JNJ should be a core holding in anyone's portfolio
JNJ put profit before the safety.
It's pretty sad when this board will not let you post the companies financials. You should take a close look at them.
Don’t overlook the fact that JNJ vaccine is easy to transport to remote areas. Worldwide it will be a game changer
Hey when it's time to clean up the baby we all like to reach for J&J am I right?
BE RICH BUY JNJ
JNJ's new one dose vaccine moves it to the top of the pack.
We want the truth JNJ!!!
"If you expect something and it occurs no big deal.If you expect something and it does NOT occur; that's a possible big deal.If you don't expect something and ""something"" does occur, that may be a big deal.Now riddle me this: Was ANYONE NOT expecting the JNJ vaccine to be approved by the FDA? That's right--everyone, even JNJ bears!, expected this weekend's news and this is why shares should not move that much either way. Translation: the market is forward thinking; when it get things ""wrong"" is when times get exciting."
Fauci always trying to make Trump look bad......Lmfao this old man needs to retire.
Looks like JNJ will has a vaccine
More buys but more big sell
Well started position at $139.51. Let’s see if I can get more shares lower.
i added more shares today
plus 4 dollars now?
Any chance of dividend increase. They sure have a lot of cash
"Quoted from Cramer 's piece....see if the story dies down, especially now that some are speculating that Gorsky and other execs sold stock ahead of the news stories. I think that's unfair. But it is out there."
"Approval from the FDA, estimated in 2 weeks, single dose and no refrigeration needed, wow , great work JNJ"
"This sums it up for me. Only the very beginning. My piece of advice if I may, maintain your vision, understand the doors that have now opened up with the $JNJ validation. Freedom to fund those highly profitable orphan indications that both Bruce Given and Chris Anzelone have emphasized.https://twitter.com/truthtracer/status/1047888666985549824"
Safety factor of JNJ will propel upward good move watch and learn
"Interesting! JNJ tends to go up after ex-dividend a lot of times I have noticed, obviously contrary to common wisdom."
"This is how stupid this witch hunt on Big Pharms.The only thing these companies are guilty of is that fact they didn’t do more to control (they did everything they were asked to within rules and regulations).This “wins” by state just make so that Doctors are never held responsible because lawyers rather go after 1 or 2 big companies than 100,000 doctors. This saves them on multiple cases and big companies have much more money.Are we going to go after Gun manufactures for mass shooting?Beer companies for Drinking and driving?How much these companies do spent advertising negative effect? “Drink responsibly” “don’t drink and drive” “use guns in safe manner”… these type of advice is nothing compared to how much more pharmaceuticals advertise on side effects.These law suits are doing nothing to fix the issue, it’s just greed for money.Stop the doctors who abuse the system and blame Big pharma’s for their mistakes… the doctors can kill people and blame it on someone else. This type of scapegoating of Pharma companies sets a dangerous precedent to Doctors responsibilities.In the end, Lawyers walk away with pocket full of money, victims get scraps and when companies shutdown, people lose jobs and drug prices go up."
Take advise from an old fart (me). Buy JNJ on dips works well
People don’t understand that this vaccine will be approved immediately. It is a single shot and protects against severe disease and gold standard study including protection against the SA strain.
I have owned this stock for over 20 years. Growth not as fast as the technology companies but I am ok with that. Nice dividends

Also in my opinion just was deleted earlier is the FDA should be investigated to how does Johnson & Johnson get so many drugs approve so quickly there's got to be friends on that board there or investors something fishy going on.

The DOJ and SEC are simply doing their due digilence. I know the shorts are hoping there is some sort collapse but JNJ will fully cooperate and we will move on. End of story.

I have been a long time stock-holder of JnJ but I had to sell my shares and I'm not comfortable with the present situation.Countless law suits are pending and will probably grow if they lose these cases.Their P/E is already high enough.IT has been a great company and a quality company but these lawyers know hos to twist things to benefit their self and I don't like saying that.

What a day. Pretty surprised by the sell off today. The defensive play what was driving the stock this AM. I guess the big moves in AAPL and AMZN was just too strong to maintain the gains today.

"JNJ is a screaming buy. Why you ask. Because no evidence exists talc causes cancer and the ridiculous, over emotional 4.7 billion dollar award by the jury of non-peers will be overturned on appeal."
Disappointed reaction today. I expected $132 + today. Most drug stocks are getting hit today. I added more am looking for $135 in 2 weeks.
JNJ will cut the USA recovery time by 50%

BUYING opportunity of a lifetime ! Dollar cost averaging in on any dips and 1 year from now will be sitting pretty.
MRNA NVAX BNTX JNJ are 4 of a kind
The trading setup for JNJ looks very enticing. if you guys have questions you should ask awesomeSTO-CKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
its funny not one person commented on the facts on this board ? care more about money that loved ones with cancer even there own #$%$ of the earth imo .
Already bought in at 143.06.. Wait till JNJ announces their vaccine plan!
Another Gorsky day! Maybe its time for a new CEO. Let's not let JNJ become another GE. And why are my previous posts being deleted?
This will be 80 by may
"When JNJ cut people without a notice""At first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you 'that's it,'"" he said. ""You understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.""J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers.Total irresponsible."
"JNJ, congratulations and thank you. Your Reach floss used to be awful. It would rip easily. It stank.But its different now. Its still looks like mylar, but there is like fibers in it. It has some abrasive quality, but its now much stronger than it used to be. Congratulations for improving a product that was lacking for years."
"As usual, mainstream media anchors and announcers simply ""parrot"" the news about growing numbers of people getting infected without trying to understand the fundamentals of the law of exponential growth and decay. The U.S. has reached ""critical mass"" of infections that records are going to be broken almost daily. The key is : are the fatality rates increasing or decreasing. And also, if local city, county or state hospitals have enough bed capacity to treat patients and enough medical personnel to handle non-covid emergencies."
a good stock to buy is AR compnay IPNFF....in the past two days it has gone up 140%.... big news hita Tommorow.... better buy before market closes!
i did a quick short of this half hour ago. should have held on a little longer
What did happen to JNJ?
whatever happened to any publicity is good publicity
"Just a theoretical queastion: How hard would j&j be hit if the US adopted health system like western europe? The US has the highest medical cost of all if am not wrong? I know j&j is an international company with revenues all over the world but they still make a lot in the US. I know for a fact that my country Norway pays far less per dose of medicine than americans because we dont buy them individualy. The health system buys them by the truckload and there is no laws against pressing pharma companies for lower price. For your information: I am long J&J and think its a fantastic company. I also think an older western population in addition to growing africa will benefit j&j. On a personal note I would say the US as a country and 90% of the people would benefit by public healthcare. I know many americans dont agree, but thats another discussion."

"Back to NewsJohnson & Johnson's Stock Gains After Profit And Revenue Beat, Raised Outlook -- MarketWatch7 minutes agoDow Jones NewswiresRelated InvestmentsJohnson & JohnsonLast 3 MonthsShares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rallied 0.7% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the pharmaceutical and consumer products company reported first-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations, and raised its sales outlook. Net income slipped to $4.37 billion, or $1.60 a share, from $4.42 billion, or $1.61 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.06, above the FactSet consensus of $2.00. Revenue rose 12.6% to $20.01 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $19.50 billion, as consumer, pharmaceutical and medical device revenue all rose above expectations. For 2018, J&J raised its revenue guidance range to $81.0 billion to $81.8 billion from $80.6 million to $81.4 billion, and affirmed its adjusted EPS outlook of $8.00 to $8.20. Separately, the company said it was implementing cost-cutting actions aimed at producing annual savings of $600 million to $800 million by 2022, and which will lead to restructuring charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. The actions to be taken haven't been finalized. The stock has lost 5.7% year to date through Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 0.6%."

johnson and johnson will be part of the pysk ETF that starts trading Tuesday . very interesting .

"So, JNJ has not been performing well since mid Jan/2018 when it hit $148. But looking at JNJ history, this scenario has been repeated many times in the past. That means that JNJ reaches a new high ($148) and then loses 10% to 20% and then rebound and heads for another new high.I think, JNJ has corrected enough(stock price wise) for this round since it lost about 20% from its high in past 5.5 months. It may stays in this area for a few weeks or months but it will be much higher than $120 by the end of this year. There are many reasons to support my statement and some are already public info. Medical devices and consumer products are going thru many changes and JNJ is positioning itself to be a clear leader in the medical devices in addition changing most of its consumer products. In biotech area, JNJ is not sitting idle and it jumps on opportunities that benefit the company. To do all those above, the company needs financial muscles and JNJ has strong financials plus a huge cash flow."

"So I just listened to the reporter on CNBC and essentially she says from time to time there may have been tiny amounts of asbestos in talc and says there is no way to know if in fact it caused anyone's illness.

JNJ HAS A GREAT CHART DO NOT SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The 'LEGAL THIEVES' (aka lawyers) will come out of the woodwork on this one. Bad news everyday going forward. Everyone will be targeting this company in that it has good insurance and a great balance sheet (now) for plaintiffs to get their 'share' of it. The LEGAL THIEVES will go all out on this one. And could very well prevail.

$135 is a reasonable price.
"A 5% increase would bring the dividend to $4 a share. This legal overhang is a gift. If you’d bought during the recall scandals in 2012 and held til today, you’ve more than doubled your money and you’re getting a 6.5% yield on cost."

Raymond James new target : $ 149
Let me guess. Some catfish noodling good ole boy judge from the Oklahoma backwaters will rule against J&J. Then we have to sit on our hands and wait for circuit court of appeals to overturn another ridiculous judgement.
doubt they have the answer....
Maybe this was the reason the higher ups at JNJ sold off a month ago.
Like I said.....JNJ's loss=MRNA's GAIN.
It’s apparent that all the old people here are lonely and depressed. They write messages wondering where I am. And announce they are leaving like I care. Seriously sad
Well I got out before earnings. Made OK money if you include the dividend. Good luck
any thoughts on an option strategy behind the approval of covid-19 vaccine
Time to start accumulating
Why doesn't this jump like Maderno and others with vaccine releases? should have jumped $50.
they can by back all they want but if theres more sellers it wont matter fixing a stock price imo.
Trump made it pretty convincing that JNJ will have a vaccine. Let's keep him in office and watch this stock soar!

"My charitable foundation has a significant positionon JNJ.

"The valuation for JNJ is too rich. If you want a ""safe harbor"", buy Gilead (GILD) instead. The forward P/E for GILD is around 10 and the dividend yield is also over 3%. The risk with JNJ is that it could fall by 5% based on the valuation (forward P/E is 17 for JNJ)."
Any rumors of when JNJ may make an announcement regarding their in-progress vaccine?
Has anyone looked at $Gern? JNJ has until Sept 30 to decide on CD and BO seems to be imminent- this will add Billions in sales to JNJ - $Gern is still cheap
Strong buy one Pfizer it’s climbing
Next JNJ target is $165.
kristopher is it a weekend iob or just Saturday nights ?
No sympathy at all for JNJ. Let it fall. Putting other at risk for the sole purpose of greed. And they show their true colors owning the evil human killer MONSANTO!. DOWN WITH JNJ ALL THE WAY!
PFE/BNTX is 50% effective with a single dose and 95% effective with 2 doses. I’ll pass on the vaccine that is 66% effective overall.
"$GERN conversationIf all the data is true and results imetelstat could be the first 100 billion dollar drug in the history of the world , same effect as when penicillin was found."
So if I abuse choose to abuse drugs it is not my fault anymore. Awesome!
It's sort of comical that the shorts are trying to wish the stock to drop after an overwhelming win for J&J. This stock is a bargain at something like 14X earnings. GL to all longs.
"JNJ should dump its talc product line. Not that it contains asbestos, it simply is not worth being associated with."
Also in my opinion lawsuits are going to flourish this weekend against Johnson & Johnson.
"Just be mindful that although there are some saying there is no evidence as to the science or the cover-up alleged in the news article, multiple juries have been convinced enough to award verdicts favoring multiple plaintiffs that were not overturned by the judges in these cases and Reuters based their story on the internal documents revealed through discovery processes in these cases, so base your decisions to buy, hold or sell on facts, not faceless people on a message board with little to guide their opinions other than blind faith loyalty to a stock they are owning . Remember the tobacco industry lawsuits and the denials from their CEO's, remember the movie Erin Brakovich??? Real life situations where executives of companies placed stock prices over people. Further proof that companies and executives DO LIE sometimes!!!"
Why is JNJ up on such a horrible market day? Could it be people are realizing juries act irrationally and arrive at ridiculous monetary awards when they allow their emotions to overrule science and decades of independent product testing?
Why has JNJ been acting like a complete dog for the past several trading days?Very frustrating!
"I've been on a few juries and was a foreman once and got to read ""not guilty"".One of the trials I was impaneled on related to whether The City was liable for damages to the plaintiff and if so, the JURY had to determine the dollar amount of the award. None of the jury members were ""qualified"" to make such a determination. This took place on a Friday afternoon. After a juror stated ""I'm not coming back here on Monday"" a dollar amount was agreed upon. Our justice system is what it is, but again, jurors often ""get"" the dollar amount of an award off by a bit and that's when appeals and or a judge's commonsense comes into play. (read, I'd be VERY surprised if this award was not significantly reduced)."

"J&J is one step ahead of others in regard to variants.Johnson & Johnson's phase 3 clinical trial unfolded as the troubling strains gathered force. That allowed the company to measure how its investigational vaccine performed versus these strains in a real-world setting. The result? The candidate showed 66% efficacy in Latin America (where the Brazilian strain is common) and 57% efficacy in South Africa (home of the South African strain). The vaccine demonstrated 72% efficacy in the U.S., where cases of the U.K. strain are still on the rise."
I bought big today too. That Value guy doesn't know anything. With his advice you would go broke.
great earnings and sales gains and the stock is down? Makes no sense. At this price its a buy. And there is always a dividend increase. We are long JNJ

"Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in DC today, attending the March for Life.Of course some people, like Miley and drug companies, encourage bad behavior. Miley keeps her name on tabloids, sells a few more downloads. Drug companies make billions supplying drugs, other things needed with surgeries and treatments required after our young people were told that if it feels good, do it, and if you don't you are a fool, and will miss out on your life. When someone tells you to not worry about responsibility, you should knock their lights out. They want you to suffer from pain, and hurt, and unnecessary treatments like they had to go through. Do not succumb to peer pressure, or your grade school teacher, or your nutty professor in college who all want you to be like them. Be something you can be proud of. When you learn to Respect your life, you will learn to respect others. And one day, we will pay trillions less in healthcare, and we will all be happier and healthier."

this is a great stock that you can hold forever

"JNJ is one of those companies you build your portfolio around. This company is a staple in the market and often forgotten about because it's ""boring."" This isn't going to pop 5-10% in a trading day, but it will gradually grow and weather the worst of storms in time. Everyone freaking out over the vaccine not being 80%+ effective, but it shows that it reduces the risk of death. I feel like once the vaccine is rolled out with a proper distribution plan there will be a significant reduction in cases/deaths combined with the others. If you stick with JNJ, add shares when possible and look past the nonsense, you will be happy with your decision."
Pharma correction starts! Late cycle may end sooner than expected.
The one and only world wide single dose successful vaccine would be JNJ. This is going to be famous from here.JNJ is right vaccine which will inject real virus and develop anti bodies naturally in your body that last long. Like Flu and old vaccines. This will go higher and higher

JNJ opens above $150 once again and collapses to $148? Any thought about this pattern. Cramer once again spoke highly of JNJ last night. Is this stock capable of holding $150? What it is interesting is that after Q1 results the stock traded as high as $157. I fail to understand the collapse once again. We not even at the April highs. Any thoughts why the stock is trading g so poorly today. Could not even hold $148.
Nice clip at the end to once again finish red!! What a turd
"One hope is that the efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could rise if it is given as a two-dose regimen. Johnson & Johnson is running another large study, enrolling 30,000 patients, testing two doses of the vaccine given 57 days apart. However, Stoffels said, waiting that long between doses will slow results. He expects results of the two-dose study to read out in the summer or fall."
The government needs to sue itself for approving opioids....
FDA approves J&J's drug Penvory for the treatment of relapse MS. Great news that the market has yet to factor in.
new litigations coming in next week
Uttely disappointing. It gets killed with market down 3% and then does not recover even half way when market is up 8%
If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on JNJ before rallying up. Im not sure about you guys but awesome-STOCKS has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
I want Johnson and Johnson but I want to pay less....
"Deb just wanted to remind you jnj is probably facing at least 500,000 lawsuits worldwide but that’s nothing for a company like JnJ"

"The fed and s buying, otherwise this thing would see match lows"
I'm gonna look into buying some call options.
GIVE US THE CURE JNJ LETS GO TO 200 PER SHARE!!! RAISE THE DIVIDEND AND MAKE EVERYONE PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THE CURE!!! THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY!!!
Another Gorsky Day coming.
Surprised it was only up 0.54 percent yesterday!! I expect big things!
Look for SILLY dips in JNJ
J n J let’s go get with the program
"Presently, value has 927 posts to her name. She stated she doesn't delete her posts. Yesterday she had 926 posts and she added two today. 926 + 2 = 927???"
Buying more
"The magic of J&J is broken. Problems, lawsuits, problems, lawsuits, problems. Misses, downgrades, dividend cuts in the future. J&J has become a strong sell."
JNJ just filed 100 million dosages dostribution
JNJ on sale! Will get in under 130....
"BIVI has received FDA Fast Track approval for its Nash cirrhosis of the liver ascites drug, which is currently in Phase 2A, which has shown positive results. Current price is $0.06 per share, unbelievable for a positive Nash related drug. DD.This one could make you big money."
"What a total #$%$ company. Asbestos in baby powder? And JNJ executives hid it from th public for over 4 decades. Now here is the questions to ask theirCEO: Did you know Asbestos was in your product for years? If they answer NO my mediate next questions is: What other products of JNJ have carcinogens in your products? if they say none to their knowledge then her is what I think of them. First, they lied to Americans for decades. There would be no reason to even ask the questions because whatever they say is likely to be another lie. This stock should be toxic and down even further. Thesis the evil behind the SEC. They should shut down trading until a full investigation is completed. As far as consumers know today, JNJ products are harmful and their executives cannot be trusted. Cramer is going to question the CEO tonight. What a joke. It will be soft questions to protect investors. Cramer and JNJ are pathetic. This is a horrible brand and i am sick knowing I had money in it."
I hope some deranged manipulative individual doesn't publish another phony report on talc and asbestos to drive the price down again as it approaches 52 week high. GLTALongs.
Puts and shorts are paying off nicely!!
JNJ has the most upside here.
Solid vaccine briefing document!
JNJ will go to $135 tomorrow !!!!
"It's a sensible time to buy or add JNJ shares here. I am an old fart and have owned JNJ for a long long time. It's diversified company, producing cradle to grave products, a solid buy and hold. Buy the dips and enjoy the dividend stream."
Good buy at this price
Too bad the Dow is tanking today. Otherwise we would have been up over $5.
I’d sell and wait till it falls to like 130-135 then re-buy
"Good lord, JNJ Vaccine was called up on by the FDA, they need it now!!!!!!!!!"
FACTS yes are hard to believe but true.
is it true the dividends will be gone eventually?
Not sure on next step - great Q2 results yet stock cannot hold on to the gains - back to flat already vs last Friday close. DIV yield is not enough to hold this stock - looking for stock price increase as well given continuing strong results - may have to look elsewhere
wake up people JNJ vaccine 85% effective against severe infection 100% effective against hospitalizations. all this with one shot.
Read the first paragraph. This is what is not hitting the news yet:https://www.contagionlive.com/view/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-is-85-efficacious-in-preventing-severe-disease
"my IQ shares are up 10% today. Yep it offers no dividend. But I don't care! I'm up over 125% in the stock and its been 3 months lol.You all chase dividends, i do what makes me rich. Suck it to you all chasing boring old companies while I get so wealthy LOLOLOL"
The door for JNJ taking over BSX is closing fast !
JJ WILL GO TO 125 UNTIL THEY CLEAN U THE CO TO MUCH SWAMP IN COMPANY
First 100M are at cost...unfortunately covid is here to stay so this will be a revenue goin fwd
Am I looking at the correct stock GERN? $3.50+ per share?
If they added on the loses from lawsuits JNJ would be losing $
"Wouldnt touch this thing. The way they are all pushing this #$%$, very suspect to me. This issue hasnt even begun to be addressed yet. The best they could do is announce a share buyback to try and stabilize the price. Theres surely more pain to come for longs."
"GILD is to roof, JNJ can deal with the Coronavirus in much better way with more experience."
"Frank I agree with you, the drop far exceeds the insignificant Miss in revenues in spite of earnings ahead of analysts predictions. But that's wall st for you, over reaction. GLTU."
JNJ has the most upside here.. remember then can easily MASS produce the vaccine !
All these JandJ shareholders justifying asbestos in a baby product and their role in the opioid crisis would of done well in #$%$ Germany justifying all sorts of horendeous acts
"Guys take ur money out now the news came out of SEC investigations on the baby powder, it’s going to go down 5 percent Monday....."
If you look at the data and weed out the fact JNJ data includes the new strand of covid (other vaccines data do not include this / were completed prior to new strand arrival) JNJ efficacy is closer to 90%.
Beautifull
Curious what goes through JandJ investors heads. Do you just not care cause it’s someone else’s family dying? Or do you just not care in general about people dying painful prolonged cancerous deaths in general as long as you make money?
Theres the 150 smack down
Ouch

Nice selloff
Sell on upticks
$ISRG the writing is on the wall. It’s time to sell and buy back at $400 after covid and the market has been sliced up by the competition. Best to place your gains into $JNJ $TRXC.
"""our product doesn't contain asbestos and is verified by THOUSANDS of reports!""' I CALL BS..THOUSANDS?"
just announce on CNBC- JNJ has come out with Covit 19 and is going to clinical trials.
Will be at 120 by year-end as more litigation proceeds...Tim Seymour on CNBC sais 3 days ago its a BUY....Im shorting JNJ!
Its sitting right at the 2018 December low .....should bounce.....baby powder is less than 1% of sales...and there's a fair chance this is tampering as well.
Reuters will pay
I'm impressed that JNJ was able to change the narrative and come up with a whole new metric when they found that their vaccine didnt measure up to the others. Now everyone is talking about the ability to prevent severe disease. Well played JNJ.
"Oh look, you have the joy of the wannabe Walter white. A man who idolizes a genius, who owned his own actions, for better or worse. The antithesis of this dolt, who loses all of his money in GERN. But even after JNJ pulled out there deal, crushing from 6 to 3, this mastermind keeps holding as it's about to break under a dollar today. Since he still believes, he cant badmouth GERN, so his scapegoat is JNJ. He shakes his fist furiously ALL day and ALL night on this board, so he doesnt have to look at his own stupid mistake. How UNLIKE Walter white...sad."
"$ENZC BioClonetics Mega MergerIn 2018, $JNJ found BioClonetics ""data persuasive"" & ""technology was well received"" but ""indicated it would need to see results in animal trials"" before buy inAnimal Trials CONFIRMED todayBig Pharma Bidding War Ahead"
The reduction of the award was not such a big reduction. I am long jnj.
If this thing pop it will be on the noise of emergency approval. And we all have a good idea on it being approved. No surprise there. My understanding is that JNJ is selling the vaccine at cost to the government. That in no way helps the top or bottom line. Well we will see how it plays out real soon. Good luck. No matter your strategy on this the stock is solid and a keeper.
Will JNJ fall from all time high to 52-week low in one day?
Im back TIMBER 140
Is baby powder the cause of ovarian cancer?
This is going down to the low 150s. Don’t be fooled by today’s action. The JNJ vaccine won’t be in anyone’s selection criteria- the top three they’ll be considering in $mrna $Pfe and $nvax . With $nvax in the picture there will be plenty of better vaccines to choose from.
JNJs presentation By thier PARTNER GERNS cancer curing drug IMET will be presented late this afternoon at ASH. Worth a listen
Hang in there - better days coming.
"hold off on buying JNJ until after May 1st.. 2 for 1 stock split may be in the future. For the past 30 years anytime JNJ has cleared $100 a share, by the end of the second Qtr. ( when they DO split.) So with new tax bill signed and JNJ riding well over $100/ share and it's been a minute since last split, it is very possible a split will happen. keep your powder dry and buy after the split."
$139 is critical price.
LOTS of BUYERS today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pps drops. DRIP buys more at lower price. :-)
Happy New Year to all. Maybe 2021 will put a 2 in front of JNJ's share price.
Just fire every JNJ manager since they've destroyed the company.
"GUYS! Think about it. Pfizer ($PFE) lost $8+ BILLION per year (PER FRIGGEN YEAR) after generics were introduced in 2011, on average. $8 BILLION x about 7 years = $56 BILLION LOSS opportunity cost! They could be buying Vascepa with that money and making a SHIZIT TON of money in return! Hurry, someone call up Pfizer's CEO immediately. Anyone's got his cell phone? This is an important call worth waking him up int he middle of the night.Don't tell the other company's CEOs or CFOs (i.e. $AMGN , $GSK , $REGN , $AZN , $MRK , $LLY , Genentech, and $JNJ ) because they'll start a bidding war!https://photos.app.goo.gl/PVd8fEEmJeZVX8mr9"
JNJ to zero. Company is going under. Chapter 11 soon. Why not lol. Love these boards lol
"considering that Ohio is ground zero for the opioid crisis, JNJ got off very easy. If it's 10M/county and there are maybe 100-200 really affected counties in the US, then their liability is maybe $2B."
All you greedy morons that forgot to sell your puts and or cover your shorts can shut up anytime now. Futures up. Healthcare sector breaking out. Don’t be surprised if JNJ settles the major lawsuits right before trial. Happens all the time in the courts. Nobody wants to go to trial. Gaps down—gaps up.
bought in at 114.35!!!
"Why big shorts need to cover Cruise lines and airlines stock today????On 7/21 $MRNA, $PFE, $MRK, $JNJ and $AZN will be testifying before congress on the status of their vaccine, manufacturing and distribution plans. Hopefully, we'll finally get some truth!"
"I know this board is boring, but I can't help myself. This is what will happen on Thursday."
"Unless it is proven the talc sold by JNJ alone caused the cancer these women are experiencing, JNJ wins on appeal based on science, independent testing and a history of safe use of the product. It may take a while but I like inexpensive shares I know will appreciate over time that also pays a healthy dividend."
Slow and steady..........................200++++++ ?
"The two resident idiots, kristopher & mr walter white, will not like this one iota!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-johnson-johnson-may-not-100000896.html"
"JnJ is a very dirty company. I worked there for more than 3 years, and was the most experienced and qualified employee in the department. But, they let me go for no reason. They had people like Flora Ng, Bernie Davies, Vikash Varma etc. who were very biased and looked for their own good. All of them tried their best to hurt me. There was another guy ""Bill McKechnie"", who was good for nothing. I worked for him for a couple of years, but he never knew what he was doing. Bottomline, J&J IT is very dirty, and is not doing justice to its share holders."
only down 1.66 pre market. Thought it would be at least $3+. Still have the whole day. Down $10.00
overpriced or cheap?
It's funny. Jnj announces a phase 3 and goes up a buck then it withers away but nvax announces a phase 3 and they are up $7 in PM. Guess who has more political investors???
"You don't have to be the first to the party, to take the cake. From what I've read, JNJ vaccine sounds like the preferred option. It's obviously not only a covid play, but I'm just saying."
Next will be kids chalk sticks...…...we all played with it for 60 years .
The news articles are based of Johnson’s own memos which the judge made his ruling based on.Why can’t shareholders just take responsibility? Oh right. Because them making money depends on them being purposely ignorant and attacking cancer victims
remember what is said...it the short-run the market is a voting machine but in the LONG RUN the market is a weighing machine (Benjamin Graham) so transitory news and emotions may influence the price but fundamentals and earnings like J&J have win out...
Moderna is soaring on J&J news.
Any positive news about the vaccine and the stock will jump 20 points
I hope this is the beginning of a nice recovery that culminates in the 150s by the yearend.
Aug 19 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it would buy Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $6.5 billion in cash to expand into the area of autoimmune disease treatments.

there buying back shares to fix stock price imo. you will see at end of day
It’s hard to watch this stock day by day. I’ve owned JNJ stock for the last 35 years but I don’t see any big up swings until the litigation is behind them. More opportunities in the stock market at the present time.....
"Must be nice to be self insured: ""Johnson and Johnson Baby Powder scandal: JNJ has to set aside $100B at least for litigation expenses, Napolitano says""I'd say 150 Billion to be on the safe side."

Over 17 million stocks sold today. I may hurt today but you will be glad come monday when J&J opens below $120. Not to late to short. This thing will drop below $100.
"The market goes up and down. If you don't have the cash or guts then it's time to get out. You can sit on the side lines and say things that are negative about the market. Again, do your home work and be smart. I have long time holdings in quality stocks and they have showed gains through out the crisis. Also you have to be balanced through out the sectors that are moving for where the trend has movement. Then have a stock or two that shows potential growth."
"I watched the Gorsky interview by Cramer. One would think that if talc is a health hazard, those people that are exposed to talc, the miners, would have experienced health ""incidents"". In the long run, this will be a distraction, but perhaps a costly and long a long one. JNJ wasn't born yesterday, and for better or worse, JNJ has legal experience and will utilize both in and outside counsel. Dividend is safe. I remain long a reasonable number of shares relatively speaking."
Some one said they were holding JNJ from 1980's ...back in 80's and 90's interest rates on CD's were so high. I remember in 1998 it was 6.5%.. How does it make sense to invest in companies like JNJ where the dividend was never more than 3%? Just trying to understand. thats all.
I don't get it. Did people think it wouldn't be approved? Why wasn't that already priced in?
JNJ should buy GE health-care business.

"Here we go again, green market and JNJ deep in red.I've been reading that JNJ is the most stable stock with very low volatility. I don't think so. As a matter of the fact is more volatile than most tech stocks. The reason is that big guys can manipulate the stock since it has low float."

My apologies Camidge.I know Deborah holds JNJ stock and wonder if she can shed any light on my earlier post regarding the difference between the DRIP price quoted by Charles 4 days ago and today's DRIP purchase price of $160:02?My apologies for the initial error on my part.

Mmm some nice dip to have with my casino chips. Anyone else gambling their retirement accounts away?
This thing is up solely on the strength of Tylenol...I have driven around to several stores looking for Tylenol and it has been nowhere to be found for over a month purely on reports that it is better in fighting Covid-19 than Advil. And now they raise the dividend..this does not seem like a prudent move since their numbers will collapse once the Tylenol demand eases if the virus goes into remission and JNJ is staring at a drop in consumer power across the board.

@steve & @Salmon are one in the same troll. You would be better off picking another stock to try and demonize. JNJ's not the one. Too strong and solid. It has it's moments of weakness but at the end of the day JNJ is a life long hold for most.
Adenovirus vaccines like Astra Zeneca’s are less useful than mRNA vaccines.

Lol cash has stopped directly stalking me with comments on my posts in other boards. Instead chose to be even creepier and just dislike them.I guess I will have to take action against this worm.
Geo says “it’s absurd to assert JNJ would allow asbestos in Baby Powder.”It’s in their memos for decades admitting they knew lol. I’m sorry you hate facts :s. JandJ isn’t even saying they didn’t know. They are saying it can’t be proven theirs caused the cancer. Some basic research does wonders kid :)
The company is facing thousands of such lawsuits or forced to pay millions for every one of them.

Germany market spike more then 3.6%!
"JNJ has been 144 two yrs ago when they had 10% less revenue.This price is cheap.An ultra solid, defensive stock with low beta, rarely a favorite of traders is perfect at the moment for some quick buck.It will be above 150 in less than 10 business day."

Has jnj already bought back 5 billion in stock??
FDA staff says it’s safe
JNJ parterned to the tune of $935 million with GERN two years and seven month's ago. During this time JNJ has made great strides in bringing Gerns Cancer curing IMET to market. Today very well might be your last chance to buy shares in GERN below $3.
Up we go tomorrow!! Feels good to win!! This is just the beginning!!
Let me ask you.... WOULD YOU USE THIS BABY POWDER after this news

"How can a doctor, during this corona crisis, prescribe a psoriasis or any other non necessity drug, that lowers the immune system, and may give their patient a higher chance of getting corona and dying.How can any drug company advertise these drugs right now.

BREAKING NEWS:REUTERS REPORTS THAT THE LOCH NESS MONSTER HAS BEEN FOUND.
Buy buy buy for me !!! The lower you go the higher I go !
thanks for the sale price. Boolean
When you think that JNJ is good at this price or that price. Then you realize they have a decade of lawsuits to litigate and the states are desperate for cash things get a little confusing
DUD compared to rest of the market exploding
Bottom line JNJ followed the FDA rules and regulations with approved labeling. Doctors are the ones that are responsible for doctor to patient care. Sue them ! Drugs are developed to assist with pain and those writing prescriptions are to be held responsible.
Sell now. Thank me later. Monday things will be much worse.
And here he goes...furiously typing....wait for it....

I’ve read before that JNJ sells at a 3% dividend yield less that 5% of the time. Now is one of those infrequent times.
Wow over two years worth of dividends gone in 1 day.
Is it going hit 151?
I've been snorting their baby powder for years.
wow. valuable dividend. great balance sheet and management team.
Apples to apples folks! What is Pfizer vaccine efficacy after one show vs. JnJ?Answer: 52% vs 72% whats efficacy after two shots? Amswer: 95% vs ??? For JNJ. Jnj does have a second study folks on 2 dose efficacy so stay tuned and calm down.
Do we see a split??????????????
JnJ should be looking for the MLSS of the world. Patents etc for pennys on the buck.
Can it go to $130 and stay above $130?

Will we see $150 again this year?
No vaccine data yet. We have to wait another week while they decide what shade lipstick looks best on their pig.
"MEDP = Wow ,from $62 to $76 in a day!"
"I find it interesting that most of the day on Cnbc they have been comparing the loss of market cap to the potential cost of this news. Imo, the two are not related. The market cap has to do with the future prospects of the business and its growth value as a function of its price to earnings ratio. The potential for this, if true, to erode and destroy consumer sentiment and brand trust is very real. If that happens, $40 billion mkt cap loss will be just the beginning. We shall see"
"JNJ has always said its going to sell the vaccine at cost and never included vaccines approval or disapproval into its net earnings forecast. so this is not going to make any difference to its profit/financials.This does give it bragging rights and a reputation boost. And, someday that will pay off.More importantly, this can destroy the up and coming competitors. JNJs vaccine is cheap, easy and its a one shot vaccine, for now at least. I know some people who have been waiting for a single shot vaccine. That doesn't mean JNJ is not a good investment at this price. JNJ is actually one of the safest bets in the market right now."

"Hope this adenovirus produced antigens are the way to go. Since Covid is similiar to a cold, I would think so. More direct approach injecting this antigen to make your body produce its own immunity. The mRNA technology is nice...great 90% effective rates but it has been sped up so we don't know any long term affects, if any. If I had my choice, I think I would probably go for the JNJ technology."
News out about CVS pulling JNJ product off of their shelves.
Smart money is on JNJ and ABT
"After going through the last 2008 debacle, I didn't sell and in fact added to some of my positions and 11 years later all recovered and then some. Am doing the same thing here, adding not selling and it will all recover. All my stocks are dividend players. My bonds actually increased, no losses at all. GLTA"
"Also, short-term investors often look to make quick money by investing in a company leading up to a scheduled buyback. The rapid influx of investors artificially inflates the stock's valuation and boosts the company's price to earnings ratio (P/E). The return on equity (ROE) ratio is another important financial metric that receives an automatic boost."
look at GERN
"this is just my opinion, whenever the company is about to report earnings... the stock goes up... if earnings are good then stock goes down after..and in bad earnings the stock goes up. I don't understand the logic but I noticed it with WMT, AAPL, CVS.. Again, this is just my opinion..might not be true always but noticed it in the last couple of months."

JNJ is much more than talc though I admit that and band aids is what people think of. Trust is damaged.
"July 17, 2019 01:24 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst ColorJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are down 2% since the company reported a second-quarter earnings beat on Tuesday morning.Johnson & Johnson reported a 42% increase in net profit in the quarter. Revenue of $20.56 billion was down 1.3% from a year ago but also topped consensus analyst estimates of $20.29 billion. The company also reiterated its full-year earnings guidance and raised its sales forecast, but investors seem increasingly concerned about the potential negative impacts of opioid and talc litigation.Several analysts have weighed in on Johnson & Johnson since the report. Here’s a sampling of what they had to say.Near-Term Litigation RiskWells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said the opioid overhang could be settled by the end of 2019, but talc litigation could drag on.“The Daubert hearing in the talc case scheduled to start on 7/22 may give some sense of the strength of the case for the plaintiffs and defendant (JNJ) and thus offer some visibility on how many of these cases (85% of talc cases could be affected by the Daubert hearing) could move forward,” Biegelsen wrote in a note.Bank of America analyst Bob Hopkins said results were slightly better than expected thanks to strong international pharma growth and less generic headwinds.“Until we get more clarity on some of the litigation facing JNJ, we expect the stock to remain range-bound,” Hopkins wrote.Underlying ValueMorgan Stanley analyst David Lewis said an acceleration in the pharma market heading into 2020 would typically be a bullish catalyst, but the stock performance is instead tied to legal risk for the time being.“Our valuation analysis suggests the stock is discounting $35B in value but the path to clarity on talc/opioid is opaque,” Lewis wrote.Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford said there is still plenty of drama ahead for Johnson & Johnson investors in the near term, but the company has solid fundamentals and the stock has an attractive valuation.“While acknowledging that the stock will continue to be volatile on the litigation headlines, we remain comfortable with our estimates, expect revenue growth to accelerate in 2020, and believe the valuation offers downside support,” Bedford wrote.Ratings And Price TargetsMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $145 target.Wells Fargo has an Outperform rating and $157 target.Raymond James has an Outperform rating and $146 target.Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $150 target.The stock traded around $132.10 per share at time of publication"
Need to split up the company
If the second shot advances protection to 98%+ then we have a game changer - another issue is J&J tested more deeply than the other players so perhaps there accuracy on effectiveness is better. I guess the virus will tell the story. Boolean
JNJ cranking up new highs! Driving DOW higher.

"large drop today. Media all talking about JNJ pushing drugs to the addicts to make money, that's all. Maybe true, scary!"
"JNJ, it's a keeper, great company, great dividend, it's a long term hold. I can't wait to see come April whether they will increase the dividend from a low of .4 cents to a high of .6 cents bringing the dividend to.90 cents or taking it up a nickel to .89 cents a share. GLTA."
"What are the odds of J&J coming up with a vaccine before others??I say 65%....even if another company comes up with one, would J&J be contracted for some or all of the production???"

"Thank you Moody's, for that dip. Filled all my buy orders and it's going right back up. JNJ has a Aaa rating and tiny little debt compared to the cash flow and equity. Go ahead and put it on negative watch. Who cares?"
"Read article that Jim Cramer says wait to buy. I have held on to this stock for over 20 year. I don't wait for any to tell me when I should buy a good solid company like JNJ, PG or any other such companies. Over time these solid companies will make you money just not as fast as the FANG or some tech companies."

This is the quiet one that will save us all.. the real deal.. one dose.. easy transportation... forget $MRNA and $PFE hype.
The trolls are out now. Pouncing on JNJ. They just never learn. GLTA longs. This bump in the road will pass.

This has been down recently as low as 109. Is it too high a price right now (considering the gravity of the CV situation) to buy?
"Don't forget here that JNJ is the only leading vaccine candidate that is one shot and no special conditions for travel and distribution. This makes it the most likely to be the preferred vaccine candidate globally vs the 2 shot options and special conditions for distribution. Also JNJ has the largest phase 3 trial with 60,000 so likely will have the most robust data set coming out down the road. I'd bet on JNJ being the vaccine leader for COVID in 2021"

JnJ and Janssen are a bunch of morons for dropping a billion dollar drug from Geron! There only one other competitor and they’ll have Phase III going soon.

We are in the early stage of a new bull run. Wouldn't be surprised to see us knocking on the doors of 170-180 area in a few months. 170 is still only 20 times forward earnings. JnJ pe has gone in the past to 23 during bull runs and the dividend yields had gone to 2% at those times.

Buy SGYPFDA will approve Truelance for two more applications next Wednesday. This will increase sales projections of Truelance past $1 billion in sales by 2020. Also makes a buyout target now. 75 million short of a float that’s 150 million makes it 50 percent short or $10 to $15 a share.

Ok..last statement on this stock. The reward on this is about 60% for the down side 10% upside and 30% it trades flat. If you read charts this can pull back 50%. The best upside is 10%. You do risk/reward and make your trades..either way good luck.
Why is this still above $99 per share?!?

Could we see a reversal leading up to earnings? I certainly hope so!
vbiv buy out by PFE
I cant possibly think of JNJ revenues getting affected due to coronavirus. If anything many of JNJ’s consumer health care products and some pharmaceuticals will be in hot demand. It is possible some of the elective surgeries like hip and knee replacement etc could get postponed and as a result JNJ device sales could get mildly affected. Net net it should be a moderate positive. This is the stock to be in in this environment with its guaranteed growing dividend that far exceeds money market rates along with strong capital appreciation potential from these rock bottom levels.
How can all these Judges and Jurys be wrong ? LMAO !
wow!
Interesting to see that JNJ is down today with the great results that just came out. Novavax on the other end is up 48% !!! The efficacy results in South Africa are basically the same as the JNJ. Both good results for these 2 vaccines one being one shot and soon available worldwide. Nova ax will be coming much later.

JNJ going to zero...Asbestos shows up 20-30 years later...JNJ is history! They knew about it decades ago and did nothing. Zero coming and BK galore.
"Mark your calendars! on 7/21 $MRNA, $PFE, $MRK, $JNJ and $AZN will be testifying before congress on the status of their vaccine, manufacturing and distribution plans. This will undoubtedly give Nvax a boost if the landscape is as we all think it is and NVAX is the real deal."
Monitor DVAX this Thursday. Possibly something Big maybe developing.DVAX Moving up Earnings call 2 weeks early is very unusual. And like Barry said Valneva is already has earnings report scheduled on Feb 25. Valneva was looking for Big Pharma to distributes it’s COVID vaccines in the US. Maybe Valneva and DVAX will jointly announce XXXX as it’s partner this Wednesday. That would be a dream!
NO other company has ever produced a 72% vaccine on just ONE DOSE and the two dose study is coming out soon.

"A new Burger King commercial: ""We don't put asbestos in our beef!"""
"A South Carolina jury failed to reach a verdict in the second trial of a lawsuit claiming Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder caused a rare cancer linked to asbestos exposure.Judge Jean Toal ordered a mistrial Thursday evening after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked 11-1 in the lawsuit brought by the husband of lawyer Bertile Boyd-Bostic, who died at age 30 of mesothelioma. The first trial on the claim in May also ended with a hung jury.Boyd-Bostic’s husband argued J&J knew in the 1970s its talc products contained the carcinogen and failed to warn the public to protect its iconic brand. He sought more than $62 million in damages over his wife’s death. J&J denies its baby powder has ever been tainted with asbestos.“We look forward to a new trial to present our defense, which rests on decades of independent, non-litigation driven scientific evaluations, none of which have found that Johnson’s Baby Powder contains asbestos,” Kim Montagnino, a J&J spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.The mistrial comes on the heels of a California jury’s decision Wednesday to reject a woman’s claims that asbestos-laced baby powder caused her mesothelioma. The panel found plaintiff Carla Allen was exposed to baby powder fouled by asbestos, but that wasn’t a “substantial factor” in causing her cancer."
Effect on financials should be minimal. Not everyone can win the vaccine race. Stock price will be back on track within days.
"Keep shaking the weak money for it to go lower is my first thought in the mind set of emotion having no place here.I posted here yesterday though so, for the lesser experienced, go ahead and scroll down to find my post. You may need to load more replies in order to view it.Either way, the bottom line is that this is big pharma in combination with headlines of mainstream media. In this post, I'll reiterate/point out that this is big pharma and has the power to minimize, if not completely removing a judgement and/or payout like they have done multiple times and will continue to do so.In my previous post yesterday, I pointed out, to those who remember or are aware, how corrupt and influencial even the widely known italian crime bosses had most all of the judicial and political system back way back in the day. NOW, we have big pharma that has the entire world under their thumb and will not be bothered one iota, guaranteed.JNJ always rallies into earnings...so if you can't read between the lines of the media nor able to see how JNJ is not and will not be affected through the writing on the wall I've just typed, I'm sorry and you should just sell now before others find out about the lawsuit."
Market goes up and J&J goes down. Market is down and J&J goes down. We need a new BOD and CEO!
Apparently CNN just reported that johnson and Johnson is one week away from asking approval
Why was JNJ so weak Monday? Down over $3?
ordered only to pay 572 million? that's not a loss.
what a set up here. going to get a nice pop on vaccine approval!
should I invest in this stock vs PG vs MMMM
It’s going to end up like baby powder it’s just pumped by Cramer nothing more than that
2 more weeks jnj will change the vaccine world over.

Approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway based on time to sputum culture conversion, bedaquiline can now be used as part of combination therapy for eligible MDR-TB patients aged 12 years and over in the U.S. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials."

Oh well... there's always the Jets
Is JNJ a good DRIP stock for someone to be out of collage soon. I like the idea to help them build up themselves and set aside funds every week if they can to help this build and have the dividends rolled back in. Thanks!
January or February aJNJ will announce efficacy rates.Long wait!
News media has ignored the JNJ vaccine so far but next week will be different.
It's time to sue Reuters and really go for the whole company. IF JNJ talcum powder does not have asbestos in it and always been forth coming with all the authorities and regulators this is nothing more than yellow journalism. Freedom of the press also comes with responsibility of the press to be honest!

"Opioid lawsuits are much worse than talc lawsuits for JNJ. For talc lawsuits, JNJ may argue regarding the science while opioid already is proven to be dangerous and fatal.

"joe, lawsuits have nothing to do with the trajectory of this stock nor any other stock in the healthcare market.

Once Bozo (Bezos), Give me the Buffet (Buffet of course), and Give me all of your money (Dimon) came out with their one page document claiming they were going to ""fix"" healthcare for their businesses this threw everyone in turmoil with the entire healthcare sector and caused the overall markets to become very volatile. The truth is, they will not end up doing anything to adjust the current healthcare paradigm other than make their employees wear fit bits and give them some ""crumbs"" (as Nancy Pelosi says) to allow Big Brother to determine if you live a healthy life style or not."
I am off 10 points since buy in....very quickly....based buy on misinformation by J&J regarding effectiveness they intimated....but will look to cost average down as appropriate as this is a great company. Boolean

There may be some buying opportunities developing. I have started adding again. Soon there will be a 6% dividend increase.

The deal came after Purdue lost a bid to delay a trial in the case, which had been set for May 28.Hunter's 2017 lawsuit accused Purdue, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd of deceptive marketing that played down the risks of addiction associated with opioid pain drugs while overstating their benefits.The companies deny wrongdoing.

JNJ coming back. Market selling off yet again near the close!
is this stock having a fit ?
52 week high crossed the tape today. Congradulations to all the longs that weathered the storm of doubt and missinformation regarding the talc asbestos claims made by the reckless press and ambulance chasing attorneys. Also I wish all everyone (even Value) a safe and enjoyable Holiday season and a prosperous New Year in 2020.
Remember I said 3 months ago J&J was a great buy!
Spammer go away. Then don’t invest. Many of us will keep buying in the dips. Long JNJ
10 million to sell at 125
$6 drop seems a little extreme.
No more JNJ sick products.
MMM = My Money Missed
Wow what a disgrace. I will never buy any J&J product again. How dare this company put our children at risk knowingly. Bring on the lawsuits.

Having owned this stock for over 25 years thee have been plenty of ebs and flows. Dueing the Weldon days the stock was stuck in the $60-$70 range for years. Looking back through dividend reinvestment and todays stock price the stock has proven to be a solid and dependable investment. Hope many others have experienced the same. GLTA going forward.
"Azedra sales could grow rapidly in a very short period of time. Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) are aware of who and where the patients are and there's no other cure or treatment. Sales effort, time, and expenses could be cut to a minimal. Based on this I believe sales can start as early as late 2018, and reach 25 to 60% by 2019 and reach Peak sales of $250 to $300 million by 2020.Prostate cancer (1404 and PyL) pipeline is estimated to be worth twice as much as Azedra. Progenics Pharmaceuticals will be reporting top-line data from the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018 while initiating a second Phase 3 study of PyL in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer by year end.Progenics' first commercial product, RELISTOR it's already generating Revenue with expected Milestones payments.Based on the above, I think progenics Pharmaceuticals is currently worth $20+ per share and by 2019 stock price could be $50+ per share."
"Where is the leadership? Come it and defend. Unless guilty, then I'm selling this. I hope this is not true. They need to reward shareholders for putting up with this."
JNJ made conscious decision to keep selling asbestos laced baby powder to create a future market for their cancer treatments. Fact.

"Science and the Appeal Courts are with JNJ---The tests are much better and more senitive now than they were in the 1970's. They were perhaps a few false positives, but the overwhelming evidence is that there is no asbestos in JNJ baby powder. The idea of ""small undetectable amounts"" is ridiculous. They are """"small undetectable amounts"" of everything in everything."

Johnson & Johnson in big trouble article removed?
"Although the ruling was less than 4% sought by Oklahoma, the appeals will drag on fro a good three years and the ruling nullified. JNJ produced less than 1% of all opioids in Oklahoma and the US for that matter. It neither engaged in aggressive marketing nor were their opioids popular among dope addicts. Oklahoma went after JNJ simply because it has deep pockets. Big win for JNJ today. Mark me, JNJ will be $160+ twelve months out. 14X earnings is a screaming buy."
Any idea why this with great fundamentals not going up but so many others going crazy?

"ASHLEY you should read this one its HUGE ADVERSELY effect as many as 170,000 in England alone what about the rest of Europe and the U.S.ETHICON PHYSIOMESH England Health Ministries Are Concerned Over A Large Number of Hernia Mesh FailuresUpwards of one in three hernia mesh repair patients over the last six years have reported needing a revision surgery to remove hernia meshThursday, January 10, 2019 - A stunning article was recently published by England's BBC, reporting that complications arising from using hernia mesh in hernia repair surgeries could adversely affect more than 100,000 and possibly as many as 170,000 British citizens. The BBC reports that the complication rate from hernia repair surgery using hernia mesh could be as high as an astounding 30% of England's 570,000 hernia repair patients. Many of the hernia mesh patients have been left in chronic pain, unable to work, and some even unable to stand up or walk. Hernia mesh victims have been rendered unable to live the once active lifestyle they enjoyed.Hernia mesh has been used in hernia repair surgery in England since 1990 and officials now fear that a cover-up may be in place. England's health officials are quoted as saying that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, England's version of the US Food and Drug Administration, did not do enough to listen to the concerns of hernia mesh patients complaining about the device's adverse health consequences. According to the BBC article, the Royal College of Surgeons continues to support the use of hernia mesh in spite of its failure rate. The Royal College of Surgeons said, ""mesh implants were the most effective way to deal with a hernia."" Physiomesh problems include pain, infection, hernia recurrence, adhesion, scar-like tissues form, attaching the internal abdominal tissues together, intestinal blockage, bleeding, and perforation of internal tissues and organs.As in the United States, certain hernia repair surgeons in England saw the potential for hernia repair mesh to do more harm than good and continued to repair hernias with the traditional suture method that had worked so well for decades. Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck was one of those doctors and she told the BBC that she not only continued to perform a hernia repair with the old tried and true suture method, but also has been forced to perform over 3000 hernia mesh removal procedures. The doctor is quoted as saying that nearly 100% of the hernia mesh removal procedure she performed left her patients ""pain-free.""Reports from England as well as all over Europe are important as medical devices are manufactured and marketed by international companies that know no borders. In fact, the Ethicon Physiomesh was recently withdrawn from sales by global medical device manufacturer Johnson & Johnson after German hernia complaint consumer watchdog Herniamed announced that they had received an alarming number of requests for revision surgery from those using the Ethicon Physiomesh.A report registered by the US National Institute of Health clearly blamed hernia mesh failure on the polypropylene component of the device is incompatible with organic tissues in the human body. The device has been shown to degrade, crumple, buckle, harden, and then migrate within the human abdominal cavity before lodging itself in the lowest possible point, the intestines and bowels causing painful lacerations, bleeding and potentially dangerous blockages.More Recent Ethicon Physiomesh Lawsuit News:Senator Rand Paul Chooses a Canadian Hospital Specializing in Non-Mesh Hernia Repair | 1/19/2019Hernia Mesh Patients Fear Comparisons To Failed Pelvic Mesh Devices | 1/15/2019University Hospital Continues to Use Hernia Mesh | 1/8/2019Hernia Repair Physicians Are Dealing With Hernia Repair Mesh Failures | 1/1/2019Hernia Repair Doctors Are Shunning Repair Mesh And Returning To Traditional Hernia Repair Methods | 12/20/2018Hernia Mesh Failure Symptoms Should Be Addressed Immediately | 12/18/"

"If Johnson and Johnson stopped contaminating us with dangerous chemicals, we could do away with the American Cancer Society, and many other companies spending money on cures, when we know darn well what the casues are.

What about a vaccine from JnJ? Has anybody any news?

"An important distinction is individual protection vs population protection to control the pandemic. The J & J vaccine should help from an epidemiological perspective but not as protective as Pfizer/Moderna for an individual. Let’s see what Dr Fauci (who already received the Moderna vaccine) and the task force decide for the country From an individual standpoint, I plan on taking the vaccine. I would want the vaccine with the highest efficacy otherwise I would be hesitant to resume a more normal lifestyle."
"AND it takes 28 days for the Moderna to reach its peak so what if J&J is 20 ....15.......12....10 days to reach peak on its second dose...BAM...200 a share...please kids...chill...did you notice, and not that i care BUT no analyst downgrades. Boolean"

Johnson and Johnson is cheap if the corporate tax proposal taking corporate tax from 39.6% to 20%. This is going to be unbelievable. Bring money back in country at 5%. Oh baby.

You have to buy today to get DIVIDEND.May 25 or tomorrow is ex-dividend date for JNJ.You get $.90/shr if you buy today.
"jnj was/is going to sell the vaccine at no-profit price so from that perspective it doesn't change the overall profitability of the company. of course, if its vaccine becomes popular, it would add to jnj's goodwill/reputation in public perceptions.fortunately for me, I sold my jnj holdings at 68, which at first looked like a mistake but now i have chance to buy back at more favorable price."

I have joked here before about this whole talc thing and I want to just say I hope for all the JNJ holders that you make it through the storm and use this as a buying opportunity. Geron is struggling as well and perhaps one day the 2 will endeavor to grow together ! BTW farstain hopefully is not behind this with motley fool and shorting the stock.. he is a low life with no moral compass.

J&J’s trials had the current variants included in the trials moderna and pfizer didn’t and that’s why they are working on a booster (3rd shot). What a joke pretty soon you will need a shot ever month with them.
Don’t fret and don’t forget - this is a cradle to the grave stock and will be around for a long time for we all use their products over our lifetime.

"If I give you the cure for covid I expect something in return.

Recent payouts for Asbestos lawsuits will encourage trial lawyers to increase claims until JNJ is bankrupt. Watch closely and sell soon.
"This will give jnj the reason not to increase the dividend. if this goes to $110 I'll add more. Right now, still way above where I paid"
Another split on way...
146 calls due on Friday (in 4 days) are cheap at 90 dollars and the 147 ones are 35 dollars.
"Terrible results considering the two that beat them to the table are far more effective. 72% (in the US) from getting it and 85% of keeping cases from being severe? That would have been great three months ago! Today? Most would rather just wait for the two shot dose. I'm young and not concerned about covid, but if I am going to pump a vaccine into my body, which I plan to do so I can be guilt free when I ditch the mask, I want one that is the most effective."
I guess Jim Chanos will be announcing his short on this stock. This guy is a real loudmouth. Was on CNBC yesterday.
Why is JNJ down almost $2.00 today? I haven’t noticed any real new negative news today or yesterday? Is there a negative surprise coming later today?

"This from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health: There is very promising news about a third vaccine that is expected to be authorized by the FDA for emergency use and roll-out across the country soon. This one-dose vaccine, produced by Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine division, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, has shown to be safe and effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID infection in a multi-country study. This means that by taking the vaccine, you would be less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to suffer moderate to severe illness or death due to COVID-19. Plus, this vaccine is a single shot which will eliminate the need for scheduling a second dose. If this vaccine does receive emergency use authorization, it is likely that it will be available for use in the United States in early March."
"Bought the JNJ shares last time at $62, don't remember when. Will consider to buy more if it drops below $130. With aging population, health care is the place to be. Current health care holdings are JNJ, PFE, CELG and GILD, like JNJ and PFE's dividend most."
Gotta think this week we hear from jnj on vaccine...interim look based on events being reached
Most of you already know this but JNJ is like a big mutual fund because of the companies philosophy of diversification. Not even sure but I believe there are more than 200+ companies within JNJ. Each has it's on P&L. As a former employee for 24 years I've seen most everything. I was just getting started when the Tylenol crisis happened in Chicago. We weathered that storm. Several down markets & recessions. At the end of the day and moving forward JNJ is such a solid company that is will managed. Great lifetime investment. Pass along to your grandchildren one day. Steady as they come. Good luck all longs.

"Alex CarchidiFor investors seeking to turn a modest initial investment into millions, explosive growth is desirable. And unexpectedly explosive growth is exactly why many healthcare investors are now looking at the vaccine start-up Vaxart (NASDAQ:VXRT) with newfound appreciation. Vaxart's stock soared more than 90% last week when it announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate had been chosen to participate in the U.S. government's accelerated vaccine development program, and that it planned to scale up its vaccine manufacturing capabilities to supply its anticipated clinical-trial needs. Before these two announcements, the company was barely on the market's radar, in part because it only joined the Russell 3000 index this week."

Meltdown. Game Over.

Government wants their refund since its only 65% effective. JNJ is going downhill.
More CANCER CAUSING HAIR CUTS on the way...LOL!
So J&J wins an important talc cancer case in NJ and has FDA approval to expand Xarelto treatments - then most analysts are expecting an earnings beat next week. What do we get? another red day when the market is up?? Totally illogical and quite frustrating that positive news is ignored and negative news sends the price plunging. There is no logical reason JNJ should not be steady over $140 right now.
It is a travesty that an outstanding company like JNJ that has improved the life of millions people is spending billions to protect themselves from lawyers who use the courts to steal from this company and the shareholders.
"Novavax’s influenza vaccine NanoFlu has outperformed Sanofi’s Fluzone Quadrivalent on measures of immunogenicity in a phase 3 trial. The trial hit its primary and key secondary endpoints, sending Novavax’s stock up 40% and sparking talk of an accelerated FDA approval. “With these data, we now have a clear path forward to licensure with our differentiated recombinant influenza vaccine.

Great news. See you at $135
shorting I after hours might be a good move!!! just saying
I'm a long for 25 years and do have to laugh at those that thought by owning JNJ before it was approved was going to make you rich. As you see thats not the case and if you want to get rich with JNJ I suggest you buy when you can and not touch it until you retire. The hype on this vaccine sucked in a lot of dreamers.
JNJ doing great today. LexaGene (LXXGF) has a pathogen diagnostic instrument that gets results in an hour. JNJ will probably be interested in them.

To get into this melanoma trial, you needed to be refractory, which means that you had tried all known drugs to mankind and nothing had worked. GALT GR-MD-02 is not just a huge Nash drug but it's also a huge cancer drug. So when comparing GALT with MDGL which has a Nash drug now at $306 per share, keep this in mind. Now add in the rest of GALT pipeline. This is why I said that GALT is currently worth $60 to $100 per share and could be worth in excess of $300 per share in the next one or two years.

"I think the investing audience is under valuing the JNJ vaccine results - stuck on the 66% world or 72% efficacy numbers compared to the headline 95% for the 2 dose options after both shots - and not looking at this in a complete sense. The JNJ vaccine is 72% effective at illness prevention with one shot - compared to ~50% for the first dose of the 2 shot options. JNJ reaches 100% effectiveness at hospitalization and death prevention after 28 days - compared to 45 days and requiring the 2nd shot for the 2 dose vaccines. Combine this with the fact that the one shot vaccine is easier to distribute, only requiring basic refrigeration and the fact that many people will not get the 2nd shot of the 2 dose options at all or in the right time period then the JNJ vaccine is arguably a superior vaccine option to control COVID more quickly and more completely than the 2 dose options."

Be very careful since you may get dividend this week.

"So the JnJ vaccine is very nuanced, but it does appear to be a good one. Note that against the South African variant, its 57% efficacious vs The Novavax vaccine at 60% efficacy ...almost identical. Considering the so called experts are predicting the variant versions will be the dominant strains, you can throw out the 95% and 94% stats out for Pzizer and Moderna...it’s not known what their efficacy against the variants are, since their stats were based on the Wuhan strain which was predominant when they did their trials. So based on the variant strains, it appears JnJ is right with the pack."
Time for the SEC to investigate?
An appeal will reduce award to a few hundred thousand if that. BUY!
!!! ??? BAD NEWS ???!!!
$JNJ needs to decide on $VXRT in Q2...perhaps this leaked.. also $AZN s failures will help the probability of Vaxart getting gov't funding and being included in the EUA. Most other countries still desperately need vaccines and an easy way to distribute so even if the US doesn't fund i'd be amazed if another country didn't step in soon...

"In case anyone missed the following (located below JNJ quote)...I have previously commented my opinion re how JNJ may benefit (not so much) if it developed a vaccine. I proffered that some vaccines will be donated and that it wouldn't be a good look to make an outrageous profit from a vaccine, and thus, the benefit might be muted compared to some dreamers' opinions. Of course, JNJ is a HUGELY diversified company and not a one or two trick pony.Enjoy:https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-the-fda-may-approve-a-covid-19-vaccine-before-the-november-elections-according-to-jefferies-biotech-research-team-2020-06-19?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"

Plaintiffs indicate they have suffered infections, adhesions, severe internal damage and have had to undergo risky revision surgery to have the mesh removed. Often, pieces of the mesh must remain within the body.Rather than promptly issuing a nationwide hernia mesh recall, Johnson & Johnson opted to simply remove the product from shelves and cease further sales within the United States last year. However, individuals nationwide continue to have the defective product in their body and may face continuing risks that the Ethicon Physiomesh may fail.As hernia mesh lawyers continue to review and file a number of lawsuits for individuals nationwide who had Ethicon Physiomesh implanted, a motion was filed last month with U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML), seeking to transfer all cases to the Middle District of Florida for coordinated discovery pretrial proceedings. The panel heard oral arguments on the motion last week in San Antonio, Texas."
"So, Esetamine failed but JNJ applied for approval anyway. It seems that JNJ is getting desperate and it takes risk for a failed drug too since it spent so much time and money on it. Johnson & Johnson JNJ announced data from a phase III study, evaluating its investigational esketamine nasal spray in combination with newly initiated oral antidepressant (NIOD) on patients with treatment-resistant depression as compared to placebo nasal spray plus the NIOD. The study failed to demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoint.The primary objective of the program was to show that switching patients to a fixed dose of esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) along with NIOD led to better improvement in depressive symptom in comparison to a shift to placebo coupled with NIOD.The combination failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms after being administered with the 84 mg dose of esketamine nasal spray plus NIOD compared with placebo and NIOD. Therefore, per the prespecified analysis plan, the 56 mg dose could not be formally evaluated through this program. Improvement in symptoms was assessed by the change in a depression severity rating scale score from baseline to four weeks."

"If a second JNJ booster shot a month later rises the resistance to the 95% Moderna and Pfizer share and JNJ charges the same amount for the 2 shot regimen, then this will still be a great ""shot in the arm"" for JNJ's financial bottom line.

"Novavax’s influenza vaccine NanoFlu has outperformed Sanofi’s Fluzone Quadrivalent on measures of immunogenicity in a phase 3 trial $FATECantor Fitzgerald analyst Charles Duncan raised the firm's price target on Novavax to $23 from $16 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares after the company announced positive top-line data from its pivotal Phase 3 study of NanoFlu in combination with Matrix-M adjuvant in adults over 65 years of age. NanoFlu showed not only non-inferior, but increased immunogenicity compared to Fluzone in this Phase 3 study across the four strains used to formulate it, as well as, and importantly, H3N2 drifted strains, Duncan tells investors in a research note. The analyst says the efficacy component of the clinical profile, combined with safety, lowers the clinical, regulatory, and even commercial risk of a new NanoFlu-driven vaccine paradigm in the future, but also should enhance conviction on Novavax's platform more broadly."

Fidelity knows beforehand the cumulative dollar amount it will receive on behalf of its accounts. I don't know what governs what time of the day (two days before div payment) it buys. One buy or a few buys? I have wondered if the extra demand for shares, via reinvestment has any impact. Roughly speaking, JNJ paid out $2.67B this past Q. What percent of this amount was reinvested? Reinvestment is spread across at least two days. I figure reinvestment has only a modest impact on the share price.Cheers!"

All it takes is a little money. For someone to lie and delude themselves.
Sad and weak end to the month following solid earnings and strong projection on a COVID vaccine. The stock should be consistently north of $150 and not stuck in the mid $140s. JNJ is going to weather the COVID crisis just fine a year from now and the outlook is positive so why the weakness?

"This is easy money. This market is going to stuff money into stocks regardless of earnings, even with most of its equity streams down (like most others in the sector) this stock is still going up.

Of course this is my humble opinion."

The last time JNJ did something like this it blew up. have you guys heard of awesomeS-TOCKS. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.

"From WSJ...Plaintiff lawyers are hoping to make talc torts the next asbestos racket, but their dreams of mega-payoffs may have been shattered last week when a judge in California tossed a $417 million jury award against Johnson & Johnson .The case was brought by a 63-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer who had used baby powder for more than 40 years. She claimed the talc caused her cancer and that J&J knew the product was carcinogenic but failed to warn consumers. A Los Angeles jury in August awarded the plaintiff $70 million in compensatory and $347 million in punitive damages.Johnson & Johnson appealed the verdict and requested a new trial, which California superior court judge Maren Nelson granted after ripping apart the plaintiff lawyers’ arguments and evidence.For instance, trial lawyers tried to foist liability on Johnson & Johnson even though its subsidiary JJCI had manufactured baby powder after 1967. The judge noted that “the law is well established that ordinarily a holding company cannot be held liable for the acts of its wholly owned subsidiary” absent evidence that the consumer unit was an agent of the company, which the lawyers did not show.The judge also deemed the plaintiff’s evidence lacking. No causal link has been established between talc and ovarian cancer, as even one plaintiff expert testified. Lawyers sought support from an epidemiologist, but the judge noted that the “expert did not properly employ the methodology she espoused.”While the plaintiff attorneys then sought “to argue that epidemiological studies are not required to establish causation,” the judge determined this is “not persuasive given [the studies] were utilized for such a purpose.” The judge also dismissed the plaintiff’s unscientific contention that the condom industry’s discontinuation of talc after 1994 demonstrated its carcinogenic risk.“The documents and testimony, granting all evidence in favor of [the plaintiff] do not support liability . . . much less support a finding of clear and convincing evidence that a punitive damage was appropriate,” the judge concluded, adding that the “compensatory verdict is plainly excessive.”After the Los Angeles jury verdict, plaintiff attorneys had been anticipating a potential global settlement for talc claims that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. But they may get little or nothing if this is all the evidence they have."

Why did it lose all its gains and then some after hours?
Will this stock ever split again ? Would love to buy some but at a lower price.

"Just think, if we cut the flow of drugs into this country in half, we would have billions and billions more money available to have companies like JNJ develop treatment for cancer and HIV, feed the poor, shelter the homeless. But with no wall, we gotta fight the drug crime, treat the drug victims, and pay to jail dealers. A border wall would help JNJ immensely."

"Buy more if you canLonger term like 3 months, JNJ will be over $165."
If people do not see these dips as buying opportunities you might want to get out of the investment game. Do you own due diligence. JNJ will be back over $130.00 this coming week.

Legal nightmare for JNJ
"At only $0.02 per share , BIVI is the most undervalued Nash related drug for treating ascites on the market today. It has achieved 50% enrollment and obtain FDA orphan drug approval and FDA Fast Track approval. This is a great opportunity for investing in a NASH related stock, but it is currently being manipulated and controlled by shorts. The best play on this stock is to buy, accumulate, and hold."

"When the analyst says stuff like ""JNJ disappoints"" with their vaccine it is unfair to label them this way. It is embarrassing to witness a stock selloff when you have a vaccine that will save peoples lives. We don't know how long any of them will last but to me a one shot vaccine that will keep people alive is worth a lot. Analyst have upgraded JNJ, but I don' think they have gotten enough credit for the vaccine. See what happens tomorrow, it was trading up after hours, but if another nut case prints something bad who knows where it will end up. It should be an easy 180."
Buy J&J today!!!
Reuters should be investigated

Another red day for this blood stock
THUMBS UP !To Snicker at theBAGHOLDERS !
"I purchased my first 100 shares of JNJ at $48.25 on July 25, 2002, another 100 on November 19, 2009, another 100 on June 1, 2010, & my last lot of 100 shares about a month later. In between those, I purchased smaller lots of 25 or 50 shares when I had the money available, & I thought it was under valued. I also reinvested the dividends. On March 11, 2014, I did my last dividend reinvestment. I didn't stop because I no longer liked J&J as an investment, I stopped because it had grown to almost 20.00% of my brokerage account. 602.441 shares x $93.23 = $ $56,165.00Today, those 602 shares are worth $84,769.47 & for just over 5 years now, I've been getting a nice fat check from J&J every 3 months.The last one was Tuesday $572.32This, combined with the other dividends I receive from REIT’s, stocks, municipal bonds, etc, plus a private sector pension, allowed me to retire early.You can't put a price on that. I don't for one second, believe in any of the lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson, especially those pending relating to opioids.The parasite lawyers & states are just looking for a big payday. It's probably too late, but hopefully someday, America can go back to being a country where something called personal responsibility exists.Don't give an inch JNJ, these drugs were, & still are perfectly legal. Don't settle!"
Just bought in today on the dip at $132.11 and I think it was a very good choice.
What time is the earning report
this needs a close around 133

What are the products is Johnson and Johnson have on the shelves that causes cancer? Imo they are the devil themself. Imo they sell products that cause and then they sell products that try to fight it. Congress his to look into the relationship with the FDA in Johnson and Johnson also.
Hoping to buy 120$. Do u think it will fall that far?
Crazy overreaction. Buyback will be starting soon.
"The company that has the most to gain by buying out GALT is Merck. Why? Because the combination with keytruda and GR-MD-02 4 mg for treating melanoma makes keytruda twice as good in 1/8 the time with huge safety improvements. Similarly the combination with keytruda & GR-MD-02 4 MG for treating neck and head cancer improve more than four times, possible breakthrough therapy. Also the FDA approved GALT GR-MD-02 for the start of phase 3 for the treatment of Nash. All GALT have to do is repeat phase 2B performance in phase 3."
you will see 125 by end of week
Why is J&J only up .25 when the DOW is up 800???
bought 100 shares at 127 and im the biggest bear in the market. selling way over done 130-135 bounce for sure
It’ll be up to 150 in Feb!
CFO testifies 2 weeks prior to the test. Where is the data? FDA states it will issue the results by the end of the year!? This was no random dump. Something big is coming.
"every day there is bad article written, oh it's not as effective, they don't have enough vaccines, they will produce it at costs, too many lawsuits over opioids, baby powder, it's not a buy. novavax farts some news and goes to $300"
Great bounce back. Hope folks here were able to take advantage of the sale.

This a simple example of how a dividend reinvestment strategy pays off for true investors in JNJ. GLTA as we approach 3 significant announcements. Earning, Phase 3 trail findings and FDA approaval of the first 1 shot Covid vaccine that will be a game changer in getting shots into the arms of world."
"Finally some good news. Now if we can just get through a month without another lawsuit... we’d be doing great. For some time now, I think lawyers believed this company was formed to fund their retirements only -and not to help people get well. Another TeVa is also trending higher. I strongly suggest grabbing a few before settlement or earnings are released next week."

I bought the other day at $129.10. What do you think?
Why are the officers selling?
Oooopsss better call woody to straighten out your patent mess ! BTW from the Geron board we hope you drop like a rock
"Pfizer's vaccine is only 50% effective after first shot. JNJ had a much larger study and will have results on their two shot study soon as well, so peeps need to relax."
I'm always long top stock investor. But this time I wish the Shorts rip them a new one. Go shorts on JNJ.
What about Ace2 protein receptors being influenced by cannibis.more studies by sndl will be done..johnson and Johnson should buy sundial.
Johnson & Johnson are supplying their Vaccines on a NON PROFIT basis. That is going to therefore make NO profit and thus will have no good affect on the Share Price .
"Seeellll Johnson and Johnson, it's to expensive for no growth. Buy at 100."
The downward slide is due to loss of appeal for Remicade patent
"The ex-div is August 24, that means the dividend ($1.01/shr) is paid to shareholders who the shares before 8/24. Since the market is closed on 8/23 and 8/22 (weekends) then the last day to own the share is 8/21. So only 5 trading day is left for buying for dividend (8/17 to 8.21). I don't wait for 8/20 and 8/21 since historically, one or two days before ex-div, the stock tend to run hard since it attracts some players who play dividend. So, 8/17 to 8/19 are the period for me to add more. I've been waiting for one of my IRA account to settle to buy more in next 3 days. I will be so lucky is I can get it below $148 but if I don't the I still buy it above $148 to gain $1.01 per shares."
"Looks like JNJ is cheapening products they make, to pay for the talcum powder lawsuit. The last Reach floss I bought is so cheap, and flimsy. It frays very easily.Did you think for a second that the company would actually pay for damages? no. We do. We pay for everything."
During the J&J vaccine trial nobody got sick went to the hospital or died. Not on patient.
I SEE ONE FIFTY !!!!!!!!!!! SPLIT????????????????

Problem is JNJ put their trials on hold.

Holding this forever. No reason to sell this. Anyone that tells you otherwise just wants your shares.
Jnj is free money below 130.. this is simply funds reallocating. Strong buy
lol weak vaccine !! just out
I was looking for an opportunity to pick up more shares of JNJ and this helps. The recent advances in pharma and earnings all look positive in addition to their dividend rate. Thanks sellers!
Imo as president Trump grounded unsafe airplanes he should also demand jnj products to be pulled off all American shelfes until further investagations .

"I really resent state and local governments suing companies that merely produce opioids or distribute them and by taking orders and shipping as instructed. The purpose of the suits are not to place blame but to grab money from companies that have it to fill depleted government coffers with cash depleted from druggies who abused the drugs, illicit sources of opioids and doctors that prescribed the doses! This seems to be an overt government taking of property without due process! This hurts us all in the form of reduced research and new drugs that could save lives. The court need to place blame where it belongs despite the politics of money!!"

Cant hold even a minuscual amount of gains
Get in on the cheap price right now.
"Anyone disagree with the forward PE of 15 something? If that’s right, this stock is on sale and should take off."
"I am starting to belief that JNJ has no upside beyond $150 without resolution of the talc lawsuits. I am not as concerned about opioids exposure. Now if we reach a settlement on talc the stock will move, but how likely is that JNJ settles? I do not think JNJ is at fault but a reasonable settlement would help the company shareholders imho. Anyhow, JNJ seems more like a bond proxy right now. We have a lot of support just below $140. We have the mother load of resistance at $150. Despite all the good news the stock is dead money at this point."
WHO BUYS BABY POWDER ON LINE???
"BEVERLY, Mass., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioVie Inc. (BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that it has achieved 50% enrollment of the patients in its open-label Phase 2a clinical study of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin) for treating refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis.BioVie is conducting a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical trial of its Orphan Drug candidate, BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has FDA Fast Track status and US patent protection. This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. Sure this is a highly speculative stock. But the FDA has blessed it by assigning both orphan drug and FDA fast track status which in my opinion establish some reduce risk factor. No one should invest more than 1% of their portfolio in a speculative stock. At the amazing price of $0.03 per share, I think this is one of the most undervalued stock in the development of Nash related drugs. DD."

"Amazing that someone can sue a company that makes a medication that keeps us all safer and healthier. Imagine the gigantic number of people whose disorganized, dangerous, potentially violent thoughts went untreated. Every atypical antipsychotic has the risk of causing breast tissue growth. It’s listed in the package insert, therefore, publicly known and unhidden.J&J gets attacked because more people used their brand than the others (Zyprexa, Seroquel, and others). It was used more because it was more effective and safe than the others for most needs/concerns. There is ALWAY a risk to benefit ratio to consider when putting anything in your body. J&J has the deepest pockets in an industry that has no friends in the media or government (same entities these days) to stand up to the continued extortion by pharmacy benefit managers, attorneys, and politicians. The pharmaceutical industry has the toughest PR job in the world. Can’t defend itself because it operates at the permission of the government that uses it as a piggy bank and rallying point for angry political fuel. As the politicians look for something to anger the population into voting for them over the next several months, watch for more bullying of the industry leaders and more fear mongering over damages incurred by the very few people out of an enormous population who benefits from great medical treatments."

Invokana sales continue to plunge. $50 million in lost revenue from fourth quarter 2016 to first quarter 2017. I guess having inferior Managed Health Care coverage to Jardiance on Caremark and Anthem is really hurting sales.

No Split. Let the price climb. Attract a higher quality clientele and add stockholder value that way. Splitting the shares only commoditizes the share price. Scarcity is the key to adding shareholder value.
Is dividend holding down JNJ? One step up and two steps down so far in past several weeks. MRK is to roof in past 2 years while JNJ barely can go green in very green days.

I'm waiting for the results that are expected this 1H 2020 on Janssen $JNJ partnership to create an universal Influenza oral tablet vaccine using Janssen antigens and they are also funding the trial. If positive results like we have seen in vaxart's other pipeline trials then Janssen is highly likely to move forward with Vaxart. Creating big opportunities for both companies. It's very exciting, this company has a big future with the success they've already shown over the injection vaccines."

"Does anyone know how much of Remicade's potential sales were compromised by this ruling compared to what was already baked in? My sense is that it is not much.The one time charge to bring in the overseas cash is hardly a negative. Net effect is a huge pile of cash that is at their disposal to be used to add value which is a huge positive.There was some disappointment regarding the expected growth. Street is supposed to have expected a percent more.In summary, there may be some mild weakness for a day or two. The tax law benefits are going to outweigh the weakness quickly. The stock should recover, imo."

let's go $160 this week. $180 end of December. $200 January efficacy announcement
kristopher pay attention in class.
JNJ a standout in this biotech shakedown. Forward pe 15.2 with room to grow. Forward dividend yield about 2.85% if you factor in a 6% dividend increase coming up. Where will you put your money in this low interest environment if not in one or more of these bluechips?
Hold it guys. I worked for JNJ and I can tell you they employ the best and the brightest from all continents to do research and come up with products to cure disease and aliviate pain and suffering. The is not a bone nor structure in any of the pharmaceutical companies to cause intentional harm to a human being. To say such things here because u short the stock degrades yourself. Addiction is a terrible thing. The State in polite language can request money from whoever has it to help control addiction. I can write a book but don't have time for for u guys here.
"I'm not pumping anything. I have ""no power,"" but JNJ is getting ready to explode. Just hang tough."
"66% effective, reported in BBC :("
JNJ didn’t release data new covid yet but nvax did. Nvax sky rocket today
"FYI.. Canter Fitzgerald rates JNJ as overweight, along with a target price of $180."
Not wavering at all long term but the flatlining of late is curious. Still long and strong just getting a little impatient of late....
"I'm a long term holder and believer in JNJ. I'm looking forward to the anticipated good news of our vaccine. When it comes to stock price however, once we get it, curious if we'll get a boost or some profit taking?"
Stock has been standing still for a year. PFE dropped on approval of vaccinewhy is this different?
For most of the World even getting a single dose is an arduous task. 72% is herd immunity and the virus will disappear. This is a breakthrough.
"OMG, the only stock in my watchlist that is green in pre market."
127.50 at EOD
Imo you'll see a flood of levaquin lawsuits now too since the FDA came out and said they caused heart problems which imo Johnson & Johnson never revealed remember they said they have the best testing there but they couldn't test that huh.
Don’t take the vaccine. I read small g 5 will be in this shot
it's kind of sad how this stock has taken such a beating for an article that has yet to be determined as accurate but the market is subject to speculative reasoning
BIG BOYS areBUYING here today !
It’s an opportune time to add/buy JNJ shares here.
"WOW, a stock down....better get Powell to lower rates!"

Too much publicity to JNJ vaccine. Vaccine business is not JNJ core. Check reasons.
"The court verdict is absolutely insane. JNJ was declared guilty because they had talc in their products. There has been indeed some controversy regarding possible talc carcinogenicity, but it has never been proven. Talc is an ubiquitous products found in hundreds of other products and used for a century, not only by JNJ. A verdict against JNJ would create a landslide of similar cases against a number of other companies. Because there is no scientific conclusion about talc and carcinogenicity, this process will eventually go to the garbage bin. For instance, alcohol is known to cause cancer, so any beer or vine producer could be sued for not warning the consumers about it. Barbecue is carcinogenic, after all."
Plaintiffs lawyers planted that article - I'll bet you they spun it and the reporter bought it on less than complete information.
scam company
Johnson and Johnson annual meeting at 10:00 AM eastern tomorrow. Webcast is available. Likely dividend increase announcement. Hopefully the stock price responds.
"""ONE"" shot vaccine is the best way to combat this virus !"
Trump keeps insinuating J&J will come up with a cure. Is this another trump lie?

Let’s all just take a deep breathe and sees what happened. Don’t get emotional
atrocity company
"Fml for not owning puts on 141 32,009% intraday"
Benefits of getting $JNJ shares over a cash BO.1. You get dividend paying shares2. You stll own the cancer killer (sp will just keep rising)3. You've made nice bank 4. You can ask for physical delivery of your stock certificates and roll them up and beat a shortie with it!
Buy J&J NOW!!!
"Did you hear that JNJ. Cuomo says the CDC and FDA have no credibility. They are both full of doctors and researchers who bend over backwards to help you, JNJ, push and sell drugs throughout the country. Now Cuomo is taking money out of your pockets. Don't be mad at him. Be mad at yourself for trusting a liberal, as they have no morals and values and trust, as you well know."
Gonna pick this up at $143!
If karma existed. Cash would be living proof of it. Bad things happen to bad people.
JNJ has a list of law suits against them as long as football field. From baby powder to drugs to devices and always seems to come through. They are so big and diverse something like Oklahoma is really nothing. This is a buying opportunity if you believe in healthcare stocks.
Look how the market improved on J&J INFO.....we go green
jnj going up dollar going down
Ohhhh SNAPPP
J&J will have to buy UEEC!!!! :)) JMO 20$$ + :)))

Lol at cash blaming the cancer victims for “not taking responsibility for themselves” disgusting.
"Studies now show mouthwash and oral rinses (Listerine etc) can prevent covid-19? Guess stock up on Listerine now before there is a run on that. Not sure if that will help JNJ’s bottom line, but can’t hurt."
PFE new molecule To prevent replication of Covid 19 virus is good news . But a small California MATN Company is way ahead in exactly same technology at stage 3 study on its OT-101.

"Want to know why market is down? Because of surge in covid cases in texas florida and oklahoma. Articles are emphasizing the importance of a vaccine right now. Jnj is obviously down cause they dont have anything. Guess who is up today...MRNA, . long term investments doesnt mean anything right now if you can make a lot more money in the short term. I told you the name of the game is who can make covid vaccine faster."
I feel a blowout tomorrow. Hopefully!!
Time to short. Overbought overpriced

everyone that made money is selling i hope 120 so i can buy
"JNJ one dose becomes the standard for most of the World. Getting 2 doses is almost impossible for most of the World's populations and this vaccine only requires a cool pack. At 72%, herd immunity will eradicate the virus before it mutates further."
Market correction in process. Repeat of January.
This is bad. Bad for company brand even worse for pension funds investors weight in Dow and SP 500. This is going under $100
it appears to me the j&j data is weaker than novavaxes data. does jnj feel threatened by novavax? recently novavax released through interim data a day later jnj releases their interim data. today we announced that we have applied for a rolling review within hours j&j announces application for eua. something doesn't seem right here I'm sure this is a cutthroat business where j&j might feel threatened by novavax and trying to steal the limelight.
"Next week huge selling, end of year sell off and baby powder law suits... IMO"

J&J to buy Nvax for $2500/share by 12/31?
The sum is just one state!
I think one shot vaccine is a failure and that's why two trail has started. The vaccine by this company may be a big disappointment and one reason to drag announcing the results and hoping 2 shots may give it a little boost like AZN.
Any chance this stock will increase its dividend?

Congratulations longs! Great year end closing. Happy New Year!
If JNJ's one shot offering proves to be anywhere near the efficacy of the two shot options currently available JNJ share price could see $175 in about 6 months time.
"JNJ annual shareholders meeting is on April 25 .thinking seriously about attending.Has anyone on this boArd been to one and if so would you recommend attending?That is when they announce the dividend increase , right?"
"Kinda hoped a stock forum would be more civil, with friendly and smarter conversations, helping out each with finance knowledge and talk about our love and thoughts of stocks"
this is a question for long-term holders of the stock on this board. are lawsuits common for J & J historically?
When will JnJ announce dividend increase?
If I was able to choose any vaccine for myself it would be JNJ. ThIs huge study which includes USA South America and South Africa we’re all the horrible variants are had no cases in vaccinated participants after day 49. Home run boys. The news headlines are just selling clicks. ￼
The management team at JNJ should be in jail. They knew that talcum powder causes cancer and they covered it up. Shame on them! Take a look at the internal memorandums and you will wonder how these people sleep at night. This is just the beginning.
"Cramer says buy it, so i'll avoid...."
"Good Earnings Report and this continues to tank, I just don't understand this at all."

How long is Reuters going to propagate this old story....waiting for JNJ to take them to court?
"The wife laughed at this story, “Who uses baby powder anymore, lol?”. I have to buy very expensive creams, baby powder is for boomers."
"This means that there would be NO ONE IN HOSPITAL with Covid using the single shot JNJ vaccine,"

"$17 Billion dollars or even $17 Trillion won't solve the problem of people with addictive behaviors. If Opioids are totally removed from existence, this same group will just find another way to be addicted to something like Alcohol, Gambling, Eating.

JNJ should win that mistrial if there is justice.
This stock is probably a BUYING opportunity now. He has drastically bounced off its low this morning. The CEO will be on CRAMER'S show this evening. The company has sent out a rebuttal regarding all the negative news. On any weakness this stock should be bought. I have NO position in this company but will keep it on my 'radar' screen to buy the stock.
Who is GERN?
"I love reading this from JNJ. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said on Tuesday it plans to begin imminent production of its trial COVID-19 vaccine on an “at risk” basis, as the coronavirus pandemic infects nearly 2 million people around the world.Manufacturing “at risk” allows the world’s third largest pharmaceutical company to produce a product before its ultimate design is finalized and released to the public. The company plans to produce its COVID-19 vaccine in the Netherlands, and a facility it is updating in the United States.“We're manufacturing at risk to ensure that should the clinical development and the trials be successful, we are in a position to kind of flip the switch and ready to go, to create great access across the globe,” J&J CFO Joe Wolk told Yahoo Finance in an interview.J&J began developing its vaccine for COVID-19 in early January with its European subsidiary Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. It’s using the same biological platform Janssen uses in developmental vaccines for Ebola, Zika and Influenza.During J&J’s first quarter earnings call, Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said the company is also negotiating with partners in Europe and Asia to produce the vaccine, and partnerships will be announced in the coming weeks.“Our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally,” Stoffels said.Vaccine eyes early 2021 rollout"
Share price is essentially flat for past 12 months whereas DOW is up nearly 10% at all time highs - very disappointing performance
Had to go out for supplies last night. Went down the OTC drug isle. Every Tylenol was gone. Every Listerine. I know they make other personal care products like Aveeno. You would think the Consumer division would have done really well this quarter. We all know that division has been a laggard for a while
This is the worlds most ethically responsible company. They would NEVER push these products for financial benefits. These claims are for nothing but financial gains. People need to take responsibility for their actions and misuse of products contradictory to label warnings.

"Does J&J have a distribution agreement with major retail pharmacies (Walgreens, CVS, etc.) for its Covid-19 vaccine once its approved by the FDA? This would really help to speed up coverage in the public sector!"
JNJ is down 25% from its high while the DOW is down 32%. It is consistent and defensive in this market and its dividend is safe. It will jump when you least expect it. Keep adding....

Just a reminder the day after Father’s Day this company sold cancer causing laden talc to be used by fathers and mothers to be used on their babies and kids.I guess it’s too much to ask for ceos and shareholders to pay for horrible things they caused.
going to 150's
This stock is going nowhere. It will go up to 140 and dive again. Time to get rid of Gorsky and have the BOD split the stock. And then let's hope the new CEO sues Reuter's for the whole company!

Good news on Covid 19 vaccine. The stock still not moving. We are stuck in this $145 to $149 range. I thought today as people start buying quality stocks versus the dash for trash we had lately JNJ could finally go back to $150. Disappointing day despite the good news.
"They say JNJ stock is stable. It is very stable in green days and it does not jump up but gains a little bit which may lose it at the end of the day or stay flat. However, red days starts with low and continues to go down steady. JNJ is created a new meaning for being stable. Just fire this JNJ useless management."
"By my calculation the FDA 14-2 Panel Approval gives JNJ a 98% chance of winning On March 4th.Those are the best odds in years.This drug is not well publicized, but by the time it hits 20/20, dateline or is all over CNN,CNBC,abc, cbs , pbsand worldwide news many will be chasing it much higher.Approval of Esketamine has opened a pandora's box of upside revenue JNJ has never seen for a drug.Simply do the math."

"No vaccine guys, not till 18 month at least. We can’t even cure simple cold! Market will crash and follow by real estate. Cash out and save up"
I love JnJ but im not taking some hastily put together vaccine. Let some other soy boys try it out first.
Next stop 150 when verdict is overturned.
JNJ's forward P/E is 14.32. A raging buy here! God bless America and our great American companies like JNJ that make great products that improve our lives in the US and around the world.
JNJ closing green today.
I take back my negative remarks about Gorsky not paying attention to the growing our investment in the stock and congratulate him on the earnings beat. However he should sur Reuters fior everything they have for dishonest reporting. Freedom of the press is a wonderful thing. Many throughout our history have dies protecting it. But with that freedom comes a responsibility to be honest not lie and hide behind a freedom. If Gorsky won't sue Reuters maybe we shareholders could!
Holy 0.81%. You guys must be rich lol
Stay the course.

Play it safe and sell now. Who knows what will happen with so many upcoming law suits?
JNJ is going north from now on!
I should have added more today. Let's hope it runs!!!!
Why are we up on a down day?

"Blah, blah, ""J&J press release in response to Reuters article"", blah, blah....What are they supposed to say? We have killed milions and millions of babies with our asbestos infected talc over the last 50 years?They are paid to lie like crazy now, deny, deny, deny everything."
JNJ is out from COVID vaccine race making GILD so much better
"If you truly believe SENSEONIC is going to revolutionize CGM technology in a few years, then hold for long term. It is high risk, but very high reward stock. It could easily 30X from here, don’t pay attention to constant gyrations in the market. I always get inspiration from this Biomedical scientist who has been long term holder of Senseonic. If anyone would knows about CGM technology, it would be Biomedical scientist. He is also Founder and CEO or FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond.“"
Bullish
"Wow, div is paying 2.8% now. Nice increase in dividend."
"Uh oh, it's going down again... not looking good for the next week... sell now and come back then."
"Consider most pharma dropped big yesterday, JNJ held up relatively well. Like JNJ for the long term, 10+ years."
"Vaccine is at least 12 - 18 months away. The USA will have over 5,000,000 infected people by June 1st. This is the it folks, its over. Even the smartest cannot create an effective treatment or vaccine in time. In fact, in the USA, we cannot even produce enough rubber gloves and hand sanitizer. It was meant to be then!!"
"Added some more today, holding for longgg"
I hope Johnson and Johnson gets sused for 300 billion dollars.
"Johnson & Johson, TEVA Pharmaceutical, and Purdue are drug kingpin and drug dealers in a white coathttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/spotlight-shifts-to-johnson-and-johnson-as-first-major-opioid-trial-nears-in-oklahoma/2019/05/03/403237d6-66a6-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html?utm_term=.09816ba76eab"
EASY ONE FIFTY?????????????????????
Looks like we have broken out of the 112-114 trading range
GREAT STOCK GREAT APPRECIATION AND GREAT MONEY TO BE MADE
"29yrs 401 1990 7 per share, drip, out at 140."
Nailed it for anyone that saw my posts.Almost immediately buying after hours.
That was probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve ever read...
Such a lagging stock
Do I hear $160?
"wow, the old JNJ bus is getting a supercharger today! I guess the lawsuit with the woman putting JNJ talc powder in her kootchie for decades isn't going to stick."
"Great earnings. Revenues and EPS beat. More importantly the guidance is raised. However down $2 because the covid 19 trials are paused because 1 individual from 60,000 had an unexplained adverse reaction. The kicker is that JNJ will not make money from covid vaccine. As a result the reaction this morning seems beyond stupid to me."
no good numbers?????
I love seeing all the old people in crisis. Taking it out on me because they are not useless to society.
"This a skip and a jump from the 52 week low. Looking very tempting as a buy. JnJ is one of the great historical companies, and I don't see that changing due to the opioid setback."
"EVERY VACCINE HAS HAD ALLERGIC REACTIONS AND JNJ ONLY HAD 2 WITH SOME REDNESS... BIG DEAL!HOW ABOUT THE REACTION FROM COVID, LIKE DEATH.... STOP TRYING TO USE 2 REACTIONS OF REDNESS TO TRY TO SHORT JNJJNJ IS ONLY 1 SHOT !!!! KIDS HATE GETTING SHOTS JNJ TO THE MOON ROAR LONGS"
Watch shares rise on MONDAYhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-says-working-speed-184245029.html
SOOOOOLD151.00
JNJ WILL RETURN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST HOLD!!!
Why wait till September to test take too long some small bio even tru this April
"It’s just the old “sell on the news” thing. All the short term traders are off to the next shiny object. For me I say good riddance, I’m in long term"
"In hindsight I am now reasonably confident that JNJ has already seen the bottom at 119.40. It may be a slow grind, but I wont be surprised to see it end the year around 135."
Flat the past few days let’s see a 1%+ pop tomorrow. It’s due for it.
Solid early gains? Month end buying? I wont be surprised to see 140 by june end.
J&J will buy UEEC if not them someone else Better than there surgicel !!!
FAUCI is a Fake.....Always looking for negativity on any vaccine advancement.
Down $20 at the close.
JNJ (65% effective) = JOKE
JNJ soon to take off.........................................
Split time.
I bought JNJ stock - one shot and less hassle to store
Over-reaction to a negative court decision...thousands of other plaintiffs in other courts...still a sell. This and talcum product litigation will hold down price for foreseeable future
Listen... there is NO WAY this does NOT go down.
Why the drop you ask. Now there is a Federal Criminal Probe against opioid manufacturers. SMH.
51 states multiplied by 250 million dollars is 12 billion dollars in lawsuits. This does not include foreign or private lawsuits.
"DALLAS — THE QUESTION: Is it true aborted fetal cell lines were used to create the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?THE ANSWER: Yes, fetal cell lines were used to manufacture and develop the J&J COVID-19 vaccine.OUR SOURCES: Our sources include two experts in the Texas medical field: Dr. Mark Casanova, the immediate past president of the Dallas County Medical Society, and Dr. Ashley Garling, the clinical assistant professor with the University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy."
"I agree that GERN is an attractive stock. JNJ is well-positioned. Do your homework and decide for yourself. Beware, GERN is easily manipulated. Do your own DD, and I feel confident that you'll find this opportunity of interest. GERN is way undervalued."
"It's looking to add to long positions. Will wait for this latest drop to stabilize and then sell put options for strike price $125 for less than one month duration. If it hits the price, I'll buy. Otherwise pocket the premium."
Is the covid news already priced in?

Jnj not participating today.
JNJ top pick2021
the ruling is being spun as a win-- it is a disaster - ultimately they have to fight it all the way the the supreme court --otherwise they are heading for bankruptcy- they have no choice here
Any guesses on new dividend amount? $1.06 or more
When will JNJ begin phase 3?
INO WILL BE THE BEST VACCINE IN THE WORLD AFTER THE DUST SETTLE.
Still Falling!
sell in May go away 
"will be 115 the new drug laws jnj will not bring overseas money in too many law suites, jnj will sell some of their companies high risk now"
"J&J study paused due to unexplained illness. J&J said not to worry, as they will be sending the patient a gift basket filled with asbestos filled baby powder."
"When Gorsky testifies you can tell he is hiding behind $2,000 an hour lawyers to try to not commit perjury. He ""believes"" that the talcum powder does not contain asbestos. What a creepy way to phrase his denial. He looks bad."
1 year from now JNJ will be at $140-$150. Need to see pass COVID.
Asbestos causes lung cancer and other cancers associated with exposure through breathing or swallowing. There is no proof that it causes cancer through contact with the skin.
Regular DRIP shares bought for $155.07 on 3/4. Next up is the dividend purchase on 3/8. Hoping to get a decent price for this purchase too which would be anything between $150 & $160.
JNJ most Undervalued here..............................
"JNJ Erleada was approved in Canada. This was announced on July 4. Why does JNJ announce good news on holidays or weekends? Anyway, JNJ needs to pass $27.25 for technical pushes it to $140. This may happen sooner or later. May be earnings is a catalyst."
"Today's market action is very measured and panic free. There is a lot bargain hunting going on. I see it as much needed correction for the stock before making further strides. Once we stabilize at this level, we are going to gradually start moving up. JNJ is going to start seeing the fruits of Actelion deal as well as the favorable impact of tax law."
Is the next thing all Johnson & Johnson products pulled off the shelves Walgreens CVS and other stores that sell it? Just so they don't get sued also?
Buy silver
The real fear is not opioids but look what happens with that. Not done until we test low 120s so wait and see
VSTM picking up pace time to load up guys
IRA's and 401k's to CASH before the CASH you were all told 16 days ago. You may have run out of time any move higher should now be sold. The computers are going into SELL mode not all there yet but soon you can see them start to sell any moves higher more and more computers going into SELL mode. One day you will se them all in sell mode and we have seen that playbook before. History always repeats and Flash CRASH told us that you can't beat the computer and the only move is to get out before they All go into SELL mode. GET to CASH before the CRASH.
"JNJ performance is horrible. Mr CEO, please resign, your leadership is outdated. Break up the company so it can be managed correctly. JNJ buys small companies and turns them to dead and slow that just adds more expenses. JNJ rules and regulations are not proactive to help small companies."
Down down big
Another Gorsky Day.
$5B share repurchase announced. Company is fighting back. The sell off is overdone. $8B in liability and almost $50B in market cap lost
So on a red market day this will go up is what I gather.
Tell the jnj guys that a vaccine is already being tested on humans. They are late to the party.
((((( ((( CELZ ))) )))))......100Bagger......
Better load up here now.Train is leaving.
119 coming soon
Lol I’m supposed to be insulted because I work saturdays and because apparently my gf is on a magazine. Old people humor is soo cringe..
"Sorry, but at 133, it's still overvalued."
we have a major health risk in the USA with thousands of Dialysis Centers in our communities.
JNJ keeps chugging up relentlessly. Any long timers have opinions on how far this rally could go?
"Once the $JNJ lawsuit noise settles down, they buy $GERN"
"I think many of the experts are underestimating the impact of the huge amount of liquidity governments around the world have injected into the world economy. A lot of that money is going to find its way into financial assets. While the real economy may have a dismal outlook for the next several quarters, the market is beginning to sniff a big recovery and huge increases in the price of financial assets. Just my two cents."
It surprise me the whole medical research community knows where Covid originated but no one speaks up Why? Is it because they might lose federal funding if they speak out.
Gonna pick up some short shares here. Like 50k of them.
"LOOK AT THE VOLUME, JNJ NEVER HAS VOLUME LIKE THIS"
So a judge ruled based on a story lol we’ll see you in court when Jnj wins based on science and these women have no proof that their powder alone causes this !!!!
looks like lose of u.s. funding.
"Why such a dramatic reaction to Old News ?1971-2000 ish The fact is there was found to be asbestos in baby powder (in the aforementioned years). This (recent) accusation thus question is; did J&J know, and not admit to knowing? Again from 1971-2000That question will take years to work thru the courts, as have the other (yes past tense and multiple) cases already involving asbestos in J&J baby powder. Sensational news story, old news."
"BUY. JNJ is a large part of index mutual funds that are ""forced"" to sell in a market downturn to cover redemptions. They have to do so indiscriminately to maintain balances. Take advantage of the process!"
It will be appealed and overturned.
TRIALS are ongoing in ALL other countries except USA ??????pure politics here.
Has anyone else heard the rumor that J&J is in talks to buy TransEnterix (TRXC) the robotic surgery company? TRXC is up over 100% in just the last few days.
"July govt opened investigations into talc and J&J knowledge of asbestos, if this blows up, the number of security fraud cases will also explode. Ignoring that this is clearly a buy, but how can you ignore that? People are dying, and large cases have been won, this is just the tip of the iceberg."
Joe I like to hear your comment about the levaquin situation did you think Johnson Johnson knew about that situation the came right from the FDA saying it caused heart problems
Buy back to fix stock price
"The JNJ opioid case is a lousy stand-in. JNJ made two kinds of opioid-based pain relievers. One was a patch. It’s nearly impossible to extract fentanyl from a patch. The other was a pill that, unlike other companies’ pills, couldn’t be crushed and snorted. You could just as easily make the case that, with these drugs, J&J was actually trying to address the opioid crisis. The two products together barely had 1 percent of the market."
"It's not a loss until you sell. I'm long, not selling might buy more."
"In 6 months JNJ will be trading firmly within the $150 to $160 range despite the lies and misinformation spread by jhon, salmon or whatever alias the nitwit posts under at any given time. Buy on the pullbacks and enjoy the benefits of holding a stalwart dividend payer and share price growth master."
160 by year end
undervalued.
"Taken from Mark C on Twitter:So lets recap, $ARWR & its partners $AMGN / $JNJ will be presenting data on 5 of ARWR #RNAi drugs in the coming days at #AASLDglobal & #AHA2020 . This is unprecedented, especially when you consider the marketsize/blockbuster status of at least 4 of these drugs. FIVE! #HBV #AAT"
jnj will drip to $110.
"Forget loading the truck, load the family RV"
"So long 150s, it was fun while it lasted :)"
Despite buy backs and buy recommendations yesterday it turned down. Stock is in deep trouble with literally tens of thousands of lawsuits
I was shocked by the number of law suits pending against JNJ. It isn't only the baby powder but also huge pelvic mesh law suits. I am ready to move on from my long hold position.
"JNJ, could be the cause of Friday and Today's sell off, because there is no news."
They are buying back 5billion shares in morning market news stating they will not their share price suffer
Can it go to $131 and stays above $131. $131 is a critical price.
TOP GUN IN THE MARKET TO MAKE MONEY BUY ALL YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Talcum powder 
"Bad timing for JNJ, they shoulda released data two days ago instead of today.Long term JNJ could probaby rise. Long term, this vaccine seems better than the other two, but not the third?Question is will JNJ bounce on Monday?"
Ex dividend date is Monday next week ! Silly to sell now
JNJ is 1 of the 4 companies the Government is funding with a very promising vaccine!! Why would you sell this? JNJ could and will definitely benefit from all of this HUGELY in the future!! GLTA
Might be a good time to cancel the dividend and start saving money for them Class Action Lawyers.
Did jnj short geron corp before decision ? They put a drug on right to try list before decision then says it was an error? This all needs to be investagated also.
No vaccine. No new drugs. No new chips. Company is in serious trouble. We have set our price target at $89
the reason its falling is Morningstar just put fair value @ 123
Time for a 2:1 split?
lawsuits incoming
"$115, that's the bottom. I can wait."
Time to buy!
I’m expecting another 5% day on my non cancerous stocks
looks like short sellers are taking it lower...................waiting for fire sale............................... then bbbuuuyyyyy
Looks like the market is drunk in love with FAANG stocks so defensive stocks like JNJ are being ignored... for now.
"JNJ: NEXT time you try to go up accept against Pfizer......Bring your ""A"" scientists."
smart money to buy at this price
JNJ is down 4.90% to 135.07
THE FIRST & BEST: BNTX. FDA APPROVED VACCINE SOON.
"One key difference between Johnson & Johnson's approach and those taken by Moderna and Pfizer (PFE) is that, while the latter two companies say they plan to take a profit from their Covid-19 vaccine sales, Johnson & Johnson says it will sell its vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic.Yet in a note out Sunday, Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings wrote that revenue from the vaccine could drive the company's 2021 revenues beyond expected levels.""JNJ's Not-For-Profit (NFP) vaccine pricing is being sorted out, but vaccine revenue will be a source of upside to '21 guidance,"" wrote Jennings. He rates the stock at Outperform."
how do I find out how often this stock pays dividends?
"Today March 11th, Financial Times reports:EU approves Johnson and Johnson 1 shot vaccine."
"The P/E ratio shouldn’t be 268, correct?"
JNJ only making the lawyers rich with TalcGate.
Should I buy this today or wait for Monday to go lower?
"I'll bet ya that by the end of today's after hours session (before 8 pm eastern), this will be BELOW the (so far) A/H low of $124.56"
What do you guys think is a good entry point?
Yes I do know the truth is scary when you have some politicians always telling you stuff that you want to hear. And how about the 221 million did Obama give to to the what was it Pakistan what they say borders terrorist what two months before he left office can anyone answer that one ?
If this goes to <$120 you need to BUY BUY BUY. It will be up huge just on pipelines over the next 3+ years.....

It's time to add more JNJ shares and reinvest the dividends. I love it when great American companies like JNJ go on sale! JNJ is a very diversified company and has a fantastic team of litigators and risk management.

"Hypothetical question: if one major company came up with a vaccine for Corona19, should the share so millions of doses would be made faster ?"

JNJ will probably hit 166.00 monday and JNJ will hit its new target of 185.00 in one week
It's stupid discounts like this that put a smile on my face that I have dividend reinvestment.
I bought under 130 but probably won't get any chances to increase my position
"I sold my holdings after reading the Dec 2018 article outlining the history of asbestos in talc. Great company in the past, BUT asbestos definitely in talc, company knew, hid from regulators, juries will not abide, there will be huge penalty fines. 50000 law suits, and more coming."

"Do you remember a very, very long time ago when JNJ had forward growth metrics similar to .. TXMD ?Those were the days my friends and unfortunately they've ended.......TXMD "

"Congrats, JnJ! As an ordinary retail stock trader, I see you as a benchmark of the “correction” going on in the Stock market. I believed your vaccine will be a game-changer. "
It's not surprising that Reuters has not reported jnj's latest talcum powder lawsuit win reported by the press yesterday 2nd August 2019.The most important take is that this is the 6th win by jnj this year .

So how bad will JNJ get hit tomorrow? The award won't survive the appeals but tomorrow will be bloody
$200 billions cash company. Will start buying back shares.
I said a few days ago that a fair value for Johnson and Johnson would be 140.00. This is a great dividend queen on top of it. Even with the drug lawsuit Johnson and Johnson will work there way through this to a settlement. Johnson and Johnson has so many streams of revenues that I even see them continuing to increase the annual dividend again. Those buyers who are investing at this time are getting a discount on the stock price without a doubt.

Remember when British Petroleum destroyed the planet?
"As I keep saying, time to get rid of Gorsky! Unlike people who care about their dividend, I care about growth. As of now, the stock is down by $ 2.62!"
"Alex maybe companionate and politically correct but he is running J&J like a charity not a corporation. It's time for a change in leadership! When he announced that J&J would no longer be selling J&J talc products in the US or Canada, our late, great CEO Jim Burke probably rolled over in his grave!! Had Jim Burke done that during the Chicago TYLENOL tampering, there would be NO J&J TODAY. Mass tort lawyers would have flocked to every court in the nation. Gorsky's action with the talc products only insures that these #$%$ of the earth lawyers will now tell the liberal juries ""look what J&J did - they took the products off the market, they are obviously GUILTY!!"" Thanks Alex!!"
So funny this market is. JNJ beats all estimates but it is pushed down. Paid news media like Blumberg and Reuters try very hard to spin the facts to help shorts but they won't get anywhere since JNJ will recover and burns these shorts eventually. May be share buyback will help now.
A downgrade is in the way.

$JNJ CEO tells that people will need Covid-19 shot annually for years. We got this! Time to load up with this dip. Patience diamond hands!
time to sellthe junk
can anyone please tell me why Johnson Johnson hasn't split since 1999? I guess J&J has more cash than a knows what to do with so they don't need any more investors. it would be like a fire sale if J&J split two or three to one.I know stock splits don't increase the total value but when those split stocks go back up to the original per share price before the split they double and triple the total value.
Donald trump would be a good vaccine test candidate
lmao - send the stuff that only work 65% of the time to S. Africa
"Let's get back to the $140's, then $150's."
Who can defend a company imo that of all the fact come out have been exposing a product to our babies me you all of our loved one through all the years .
It's funny how all the big mouth bumpers left you don't hear a word from them now.
This is simply an overreaction in addition to a sell on the news. The FDA will approve this and it will be available within a few days of approval. Once everyone takes a deep dive into the data and calms down JNJ will still be a great 2021 story. Tuesday earnings results and 2021 guidance haven't changed. Those are the fundamentals that drive a stock price. Don't let this one day knee jerk reaction change your view on JNJ. If JNJ was 4200 today I wouldn't sell. As a retiree my major reason for holding this stock is the passive income the dividend provides my wife and I. That will go up at the shareholder meeting in April. I see a dividend of $1.10 at that time. GLTAL.
Jnj is going to break out on the back of the Talc verdict.
JNJ vaccine clinical trial(s) on humans (phase III) demonstrates efficacy. Hit it here and thank me later...
"What? Tech stocks in green and JNJ in red! Don't investors understand that if it's not because of JNJ, the virus will kill not only people but all these tech companies? People needs to get to their offices and farmers have to go to farm, nurses and doctors have to go to hospitals and clinic and engineers need to test equipments.There is no way that this condition can continue and we prison ourself until something happens. That something is either we get the virus or eventually a company develops a vaccine that is safe and it works. That company is JNJ and it will release its 1/2a results soon. It will give us a new hope and new day to look forward. Oh, Phase 3 has started and it must be a very strong results to start a massive phase 3.Today is the chance to buy this cheap price company since it won't be in next few days."
Who's going to take any CoVid 19 vaccine?Thumbs up for Yes.Thumbs down for No.Sideways for a wait and see position.
Excellent time to buy big gains anticipated
"All in CTIC now, EU approval"
60 Minutes mentions JNJ as one of the problem companies dumping opiods on the masses. Why don't they just get out of the opiod business? How many people have to OD?
“ lots of things have trace amounts of asbestos therefore it’s okay JandJ sold a product with a dangerous amount”Lol who are you trying to convince? The JandJ defends are intellectual lightweights
why did jnj not share their tax bill implemented money their bring with their employers
Next time someone wants to complain about JNJ's stock price remember days like today.
"JNJ is not the guilty party in the opioids crisis. See Purdue,Endo, etc. Their opioids liability will be small! Great company and great stock. I speak as a physician of 45 years experience. I am particularly impressed with HIV vaccine and new cure for multiple myeloma!!"
Will close under 125
Great company. I don't own as many shares as I used to but you can't go wrong putting this in the account.
66% of effectiveness seems to be China vaccine s
"Have you noticed many drug company commercials depict couples of mixed races. Big Pharma knows that when problems found primarily in one race, can be spread to twice as many people by mixing races, then in the future, they will have twice as many customers."
Started out a bit lethargic from the open but should end up green eod. Don't think the algos were prepared for dovish comments by Powell this morning.
Just hearing about asbestos in their Baby Powder. Asbestos? And they new about it for decades and didn't say word to the public? JNJ should be banned from doing business ever again. I am so mad because i sed tha product for years and they knew i was rubbing Asbestos on my skin and didn't tell me. How can any business be allowed to keep their doors open after this? Everyone knows about the health risks and the Billions of dollars in funds to go to victims or members of families who lost or dies to cancer. JNJ is a horrible brand now and X'd out of my list.
"Hold for Dividend, just a few more days, May 22."
Very strong results - beating street estimates and yet due to unfounded litigation the price goes down! Crazy
"If company is making money and will even make more money. It must be punished. Companies must be losing or burning money, it must be awarded in the down market!"
JnJ will higher bid than pfe offer sgyp in feb-23-2019!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But not sure how much Bristol-Myers bid for sgyp?
does trade tariffs affect this stock
"Ouch, but looks like an buying opportunity"
Buying JNJ today at these discount prices is what intelligent investors do to ensure a secure retirement later. Lemmings overreacting and running for the door end up working at the local supermarket bagging groceries and cleaning up spills in aisle 7.
Sold this Biden market is a clear sell. I'll buy back under 100...
JandJ shareholders be like “show me the evidence?!?”“it’s right here infront of you... the memos say they knew their product had asbestos”(Proceeds to our fingers in ears and head in sand)*mumbles*”I said show me evidence. I can’t see any!!”
Great to see JNJ recovering. We will be in the 140s by year end imo.
一直播 ID:247772407
Is this really the only defences JandJ shareholders have? Rather than being men and women and take reaponsibility. We have little boys and girls. So far The defences have been-how do you know only jandjs talc have them cancer!-semantic arguments about words used to describe the quantity of asbestos in their talk- and most disturbing. Blaming the cancer victims for just not taking responsibility.- oh I forgot “it’s okay cause we will all die eventually”
Is conversations the new message board. What happened to all the prior messages. Not having unique ID's is troublesome. Not a fan yet. Did they beta test... surely they didnt. Moronic.
sell
Band-aids make more money for JNJ than this vaccine will.
"The Ravid on Twitter this morning :$ARWR has vast pipeline including several later stage assets, partnership with Janssen $JNJ for multiple assets, license with Amgen $AMGN; if they do 1 drug w/$1B sales @ 4x multiple (on a sale), you cover the current valuation, get the rest of platform and pipeline free."
"This is not a market for any bad news. In fact this is not a market for neutral news. To me this appears to be a complete overreaction in price. Everyone is running scared in the market these days so many investors, not just retail, are afraid of their own shadow."
Hey kris!I must say I'm surprised and disappointed that you're not crusading on the RGR board.Not only does its products KILL people; that's (somewhat) their purpose.Very disappointed.

"Any why shouldn't they pay? Is there asbestos in talc? They wouldn't be paying if there wasn't. Are they dishonest & greedy?I worked for Merck for a few years and can tell you that ain't no longer don't by George Merck's saying that ""We put patients before profits"". Funny how they show you that film at your orientation but after being there you realize that greed prevails especially in the Pharma industry. If they have been lying about this and women have been dying as a result then they should pay, they should admit it, and you should sell your stock and move on. I don't want to be involved with a company that is out there killing women and hiring the best lawyer to say they're not doing it."
"JNJ TIME TO ROAR, WE NOT ONLY HAVE PRODUCT, BUT WE HAVE A GREAT DIVIDEND AND EVEN A 1 SHOT VACCINE!"
"The world is already so overpopulated that I just don't see anything wrong with killing a few hundred thousandths of babies with cancer. It may even delay, if not completely stop, the Global Warming thingee that Al Gore keeps making up."
Talc is made from magnesium silicate which is a clay. Asbestos also comes from soil. Trace particles are naturally there and have always been. Shakespeare had something when he said “Kill all the lawyers “.
at least another 30% down
The increasing ridiculous defences I see just show that some shareholders are afraid. They’ve ran from the “how do you know it was only Johnson’s talc”To now “well they’ve done other good things so it’s okay”
Didnt know Appl uses J&J products to make....
"Bring back $52bn net of taxes, buyback 12% of the shares which takes stock to $161. Am i missing something here...buy?"

we as investors have the Ceo of jnj comment on this article.
BBC just said “ This vaccine has failed humanity and this company Johnson&Johnson should be ashamed”
"JNJ the company that brought talcum baby powder, will now create a vaccine for Coronavirus, oh yeah sign me up, NOT are you out of your minds. The only thing JNJ sells is poison."
Hey kris:WHY has this issue gotten you so wound up?Obviously anything posted here has zero impact on JNJ's share price.Somehow related to gern?Just curious.TIA.
Are Psychedelics Right For You?https://www.thecannabisinvestor.ca/are-psychedelics-right-for-you/
JNJ reached a 52 Week low at 121.20
Where are clowns predicting a down day?
"How does one make money owning stocks you ask. Here's a clue. Buy stable, well diversified quality companies when they are on sale like JNJ is today. Be especially aggressive buying when the discount offered is a result of irrational stupidity in repricing the shares based on unsubstantiated allegations. Anyone buying over the next few months will look back and thank Mr. Market for being so over emotional and irrational."
So 146.80 - back to the same share price from Nov 1st 2018 - 2 years of no growth!! So the dividends are nice and consistent but the price has to pick up.
The only good stock in this nasty environment
"I find it comical! When they came out with results, and the stock tanked, did some investors think that jnj wouldn't file for use with the fda? Now that they file it goes back up? Seems pretty silly to me."
Bankruptcy Coming??
What a great buying opportunity today!
"Very dangerous stock now since FDA will do more tests and if it finds more cases then it will warn JNJ to stop producing the product. Overall, this is not done and it's just beginning of more news to come out."
Lawsuits coming and major backlash
"Down 12% for the year, this is the worst JNJ performance for many years.The conservative Management needs to be replaced. JNJ has lost many opportunities and if acts this way then it becomes another IBM of medical."
Hit piece on JNJ unfounded!
"I asked a question before and did not get any answer, does JNJ make money when they charge only $10/doze?"
2018 estimated P/E is 16.09 and the industry average is 51.73 :) BUY BUY BUY
Long and strong but a curious few weeks of performance here....
Where are you getting this trial halted news from? I see people saying it on different boards. But I don’t see it in any newsfeeds
Crecy asbestos in the baby powder is just the tip of the iceberg check it out
Not gonna lie... was hoping to see a nicer pop today with the DOW up over 200+
Down five before markets so this is today’s $JNJ expectations of down 15 today
"Years ago, my Financial Planner, knowing he wouldn't make any money off of me, told me to buy as much J&J as I could. He said that J&J is so diversified that it truly acts like the BEST health care mutual fund!! What is going on with J&J now?"
I use to eat crayons! Does that count??
L O N G. on JNJ.
Cant pass up at this discount
Sorry to say I sold today. I waited a long time for jnj to climb back up. For sure I will buy this back if the price is right. But I'm sad selling...
"Good Morning Debbie,Thank you for sharing, I too had this price on my J&J holding.J&J is a great company with very good people.With kind regards.Ian (UK)"
"JNJ/TGTX...... The future. TGTX, just received FDA approval."
business booming==== CSV.... funeral home operator
Wheres the pop on news?
Dividend next week. Hope to pick up some additional discounted shares before the adults enter the room and walk JNJ back up into the $140's where it belongs.
Nice bounce today - long over due sensible reaction to the over hyped negativity with the talc litigation - note the posts on here correctly calling out that JNJ is yet to pay any penalties and no award has survived the appeal process as the science and evidence is firmly on JNJs side in terms of talc causing any kind of cancer.
Buying again on the pullback...building wealth
"A PE of 235 and cover-up, no thanks, you buy it."
"What do you think depresses the price most? Baby powder, opiod trial, bloody MMs?https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/jj-vows-to-defend-itself-in-talc-opioid-lawsuits.html"
DEAD $$$$$$Sell or go short
short
They're going to use all the vaccines and you won't have a choice which vaccine your area gives out.
All aboard ??train started to leave !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!told you put $$$$ in JNJ.........................ONE SHOT deal ..the way to go !
Lawsuits issues are not solved and JNJ is facing billions and billions of losses.
"1,900 similar lawsuits against JNJ coming up in an Ohio courtroom ion October 2019. The $576M payment is just the beginning"
"Specifically, the FDA’s review found fluoroquinolone antibiotics can increase the occurrence of “rare but serious events of ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta,” noting an aortic aneurysm can lead to “dangerous bleeding or even death"

Talc again. JNJ will lose hefty for this unless satisfy patients. Put at least $10 B aside for this purpose.
One of the top vaccine companies. Ebola etc etc
I don't believe Talcum Powder causes cancer. I believe the talcum powder is safe. Impossible to prove that this talcum powder with a trace amount of asbestos caused the cancer in any particular case - imho.

Luckily I shorted Johnson and Johnson last Friday. Phew!

Even JNJ can have an up day when everything else is going up.

"bought a position today. I had sold on 1/23 at $147 and bought back today at $112. It's too good of a company to be trading this low. It may go lower, but I feel in time this will be a great purchase"
Will they announce Vaccine trial results Mon or Tue next week with earnings ?
The fda will approve this Friday one shot as opposed to two and it doesn’t need crazy storage arrangements. Sounds like an easy win to me.
BNTX/Pfizer is the leader in the vaccine race. Phase 3 trial results end of month

I bet pharmacies will stop listing which vaccine they administer if they have the JNJ one. No one I know wants it.

"Interesting post on the CYDY board. Looks like CYDY is J&J 10 years ago. All you need is a strong drug at the right time and you fly to the top of the heap. This is the posting:In regards to a possible partnership with BP. I see an interesting trend with the recent hire of Janet Flisak, Head of Cytodyns Clinical Operation. Now they have a job posting for an Associate which will report to her. Yet, what is perhaps more interesting, look at Janets Linkeden accounts she is also a director at J&J.. Another fun fact, Dr Rahman (Mahboobs) worked at Centocor/J&J. Want more, Dr Sanir Patel also worked there. It should also be noted that J&J has a strong interest in AIDs ( auto immune diseases) and made recent acquisitions (2020). J&J is a $380 billion dollar company.Is this coincidence, or is CYDY. a potential acquisition, or a partner?I recall NP saying that BP has interest after approval.Janet will be directing clinical trials.Im guessing this affair starts as a partner, but ends in marriage pretty quickly, especially with the HIV potential, and all other indications, and all the J&J connections."
"It's good to see JNJ's share price climbing back up to where it belongs. Hopefully I get some discounted shares in my DRIP thanks to the ill advised, myopic social justice warriors reading a bunch of nonsense into the hit piece by Reuters."

JNJ wins big baby powder case in NJ today. Up almost $2 in the AH
"The following says it all. More negative than you expect but that's reality of JNJ.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has certainly had easier times in terms of appeasing the market. The time-tested stalwart of many portfolios has had a bit of stagnation, and higher costs due in large part to legal costs related to lawsuits over its talc powder. The company also spent roughly $400 million in settlements related to Xarelto, a blood thinner. The problems created a quarter with decreases in earnings, but the company also had flat revenues.JNJ reported sales of $20.02 billion. Compared to 2018's $20.01 billion, it marks a 0.1% increase year over year. That's not exactly robust growth. On those sales, net earnings declined 14.2% to $3.75 billion. On a diluted basis, that breaks down to $1.39 per share. Compared to 2018's $1.60 per share, that's a 13.1% decline. On an adjusted basis, JNJ reported earnings of $5.66 billion, which represents a 0.5% increase year over year. That income represents adjusted earnings of $2.10 per diluted share, a 1.9% increase over last year's $2.06 per share.Johnson & Johnson doesn't give GAAP financial guidance due to too much uncertainty. On an adjusted basis it expects diluted earnings per share to increase 4.3#$%$ to $8.53-$8.63. It's relatively unchanged from the guidance provided in January. Analyst estimates seem to put full-year earnings in that range with $8.58 per share. If the company hits those levels, the stock is currently trading at roughly 16.22x forward earnings. That's not a bad valuation as long as the legal battles don't intensify.I do have concerns about how long lawsuits may last stemming from the problems surrounding baby talc powder. Overall, I think I view JNJ as a ""hold"" at present."
I am enjoying this. None of your business what people brag to their families about. They are grown ups
Puts tomorrow!
Sinking fast. Sell sell
Jeffrey's analyst says J&J might buy Pfizer's consumer franchise. That would be the second time for J&J to do that?
When is JNJ expecting to move into phase 3? This month or October?
Yes shark bait the relationship between Johnson and Johnson and the FDA needs to be investigated by Congress imo. Great point you point out
What was that dip? Micron did the same?
500m it’s a joke. should be billions. but they will have to pay billions for all the babies they murdered
"This talc asbestos thing is going to hurt.. once the lawyers get involved, the legal costs will be crushing. Since talc is dustlike, if there is any evidence of asbestos, which is carcinogenic when inhaled, will be devastating to jnj"
Lets give it a day or two. Too much noise. Hope to see green action later in the week. Monthly options are expiring this Friday.

What? Why is it going down again? It gained a few pennies yesterday and it is losing a dollar today. If this trend continues and if the market act this way then we are going to see zero. Fire and replace this management. They lost their touch and they are behind of technology and vision.

Sheesh! Negative report on baby powder. Don't sell. We will recover.
Ok boys time to short again this is going down
Down 8 trading days in a row. Will it print a green day ever?
If the current corporate tax passes reducing corporate taxes to 20% this could reflect in earnings for some stocks as much as four dollars a share on earnings. For Johnson and Johnson I have figured out yet the amount that it will increase earnings but there will be a substantial change in estimates for 2018 once this is passed. Already there has been an estimate that the Dow would go up next year by ten percent. Will see how this goes. I would be a buyer right now if one thought the tax package was going to pass.
JNJ Vaccine Data News just came out. Its vaccine not as effective as Pfizer or Moderna.

"How effective will JNJ's vaccine be in addressing the variants? And to the extent a variant can't be addressed, how quickly can an updated vaccine be produced? How does this compare to the mRNA vaccines - there seems to be some consensus that the mRNA vaccines will have an advantage over JNJ???"
OUCH!!!www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases18/pr20181113a.html
I bet they drop their dividend slightly from the 60+% payout now to a few percent less. Tiny drop in yield. Huge company with tons of cash. Strange times indeed.
J&J got caught with the asbestos probe. Stock will falllllllll
"A stock with PE Ratio (TTM) of 226.54 sure is a great buy, especially now that it's trying to get rid of it's stockpile of asbestos by mixing it with baby powder a little bit at a time. PE of 226?"
Will open at 133$ tomorrow. Way overdone.
JNJ going lower anyways SP 500 is almost broken. A break below 2550-2530 level and it's down to 2400

Lol. The judge and others have looked at the JandJ memos. They knew it has asbestos in it.Meanwhile investors here be like “nooo!! Never happened!!”Did the judge make up seeing these memos? And then when JandJ tried to appeal it the person who reviewed the case also lied?You guys are sad

Dividend increase 5.6% to .95. I was predicting .96 Congradulations longs.
"$JNJ will go after VXL.V VXLF Vaxil Bio for merger or buyout. The stock up 100 percent in the last week. Massive volume as they have 3 positive Covid Vaccine results. They are about to announce their 4th a pill form, that can fight new forms of Covid. Safer Vaccine, far more effective. Stock will boom to 2 to 3 dollars."
Who on this blog would like Salmon to find a hobby other than repeating the same talc and opioid comment?

Oh man! Big buying opportunity!
Okay so the question is does jnj break 100 this fall? If you don’t think so why? 75? Don’t ignore reality folks
I am betting grandma's rent money on JNJ.
"own this stock almost 27 years, split twice and raised its dividend every year. how do you beat that.Pays me nicely in retirement. it is a good""sleep at night"" stock."
"When you lie, cheat, criminally obfuscate the truth about the safety of the product and the lethality of the contaminant that is a known, KNOWN potent carcinogen, you need to pay extreme price and 100 billions is not enough! Let JNJ go bankrupt!"
"This has been deleted 5 x . Shorts don't want you to see this! - Tweet by Adam Feurstein Yesterday""I still believe $JNJ will drop $GERN imetelstat. I guess we wait for later this month to see if I’m right or wrong. Nothing today changes my bearish view. If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative."" https://t.co/UKOlyO799ETweet from Adam Feurstein This is the first time he put the possibility of being wrong into his equation. His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D"
The breakdown is starting.
JNJ needs to add an additional blockbuster potential cardiovascular drug to their line up as soon as possible.Why ? Plummeting Xarelto sales.MAT 9001....... demonstrated superiority over AMRN's Vascepa in 4 of 6 key lipid measures and was 300% more effective than Vascepa in reducing triglyceride levels in MTNB's P2 head-to-head study.MTNB

"They'll get around/out of it but if anything, they are not paying anywhere close to an amount of size. Plus, it will be settled out of court in the end if they weren't going to win via means of appeal like they have multiple times. It's called big pharma and the crime bosses paying off the entire judicial sytem back in the day have nothing remotely close to an arsenal like big pharma. Very few could hold a candle to big pharma. Let's see what goes on tomorrow with the price's amount of direction. If the street knows what's up, they're going to buy up the weak money getting shaken out by next week if not tomorrow. JnJ will continue to rally into earnings though and a great report will supercharge them as long as they don't peak too soon before that."
I bailed out with a small loss when realized that markets going to hell anyways. Better to stay out of trouble. Goodluck
"Yes, this is quite a ""muted response"" to some very good news. But don't let that fool you. the professional traders know that the retail investor is going to try and buy on the news so they hold the stock down and wait for disappointment of the day traders to settle in. Then they get control of large volumes of the stock thru the OPTIONS market. HOLD ON."
IMO if it cures they don't want only thing they want is to mask it to sell more and more of their product
"If MRNA & NVAX are at 150 & 140+, what would be the price for JNJ? Shouldn’t it be $200 more than those two?"
"Call it dramatic irony. Speaking to his biopharma colleagues this week in San Francisco, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said the pharma industry needs to watch itself on pricing, but only days later, his own company rolled out dozens of price hikes.J&J boosted list prices Thursday on top-sellers such as Xarelto, Stelara and Zytiga, even though the latter drug recently fell off the patent cliff, according to Reuters. Most of its two dozen hikes fell in the 6% to 7% range, according to the news service. A J&J spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from FiercePharma."
Just found out that JNJ got alerted by http://tradenow.xyz. Seems bullish

Sad death stock making money off dead family members.So sad
What ifiots are going to even listen to a ceo when the main thing is that they're lying in the first place from the article.
Do we go up or down after earnings tomorrow?
The current situation that Johnson and Johnson is in reminds me of the Tylenol scare years ago. Johnson and Johnson will get through this and investors will look back at this as just another point in which there was a buying opportunity to purchase stock at a cheaper price. In my opinion fair value on Johnson and Johnson would be 140.00.
Hey Marvin wrong it's funny you make the right move and your bashing them

Interestedly with all the recent share buyback news as a result of the corporate tax cuts JNJ hasn't announced any significant buy back. So hopefully they are going to raise the dividend this year > 10% Maybe 15%. Lets cross our fingers.
Is jnj causing cancer in all of us?
"JNJ and GSK will dominate the Covid space in the long run. Single jabs at 10x less cost with boosters going to JNJ and GSK. Cant see how the cost differential and temperature storage can win in the long run. Good year for RNA due to speed, then normal vaccines will grab the majority of the $50 billion Covid Booster Vaccine market."

"I bought at 3$ higher sold a few days ago , bought back. Holding up like a champ J&J isawinner today, all other stock sink crazy!"
Imo we gern shareholders now want 275.00 a share and up or we will take offers elsewise. JNJ doesn't mention a drug of a lifetime at conferences well $%^& you.
Seeing a ~$20 pullback in the last few weeks hurt RSU valuations that vested and paid out on 2/10/18 but certainly higher than the $115 from last year. Thanks JNJ. Appreciate the continued rise in PPS over the years.
"Sold it to early, thought I’ll have time to come back while putting the money to work somewhere else in the mean time. Missed the train....stock looks rock solid now"

"A million shares traded after hours so far, with upward price movement. Nice."
What an evil company.
"I know PE is never exactly straight forward as there are a number of ways you can perceive what is or isn't an acceptable PE, but I notice that JNJ's PE seems awfully high. For those that advocate that it is still acceptable, why? How does that work for a big blue chip like JNJ?? Thanks... I'll hang up and listen."
Will add a little to my life long position.
"Let’s let things settle down. We don’t know all the facts yet. The Reuter’s story does not tell us much. Baby powder is 1/2 of 1 percent of revenue, but it is very important to image. Many products we use have trace amounts of bad stuff that does not make the product dangerous."

Over $20 down from pre earnings report. Is there no love for JNJ in 2018. Concerned about seeing red as the market reversed course today. Not a good sign.

The logistics of injecting one dose versus two and the speed at which you will become immune versus having to get two shots is like night and day. No comparison - JNJ for the win. Add to that the vaccine can be stored in a regular fridge for months and you know what's going to be administered in most locations - and it ain't Moderna or Pfeizer's stuff.

"Since Johnson & Johnson is not settling these cases this will end badly. If you read the internal memos you know that this is real bad situation for Johnson.

"Bench Trials A bench trial takes place in front of a judge only; there is no jury involved. The judge is both the finder of fact and ruler on matters of law and procedure. This means that the judge decides the credibility of the evidence presented at trial and also decides what happens at the trial according to laws and rules of procedure.Since this a bench trial and not a jury trial, facts will determine the outcome and not out of control emotions. JNJ will be fine and possibly come out stronger in the end. Pick up some cheap shares before Wall Street comes to their senses."

Rumor is JNJ already has the pieces to create the vaccine. That’s why they can rush it into production in a short time. This is going well above $155 soon.

Fauci just mentioned JNJ. Just saying.
This stock bounced right off it's pivot point. It will do better than the market going forward. But the market will push it around nonetheless.
IF YOU use JnJ products PLEASE google and read(America's most admired lawbreaker) thank you earfool
JNJ should drop Genscript before putting more money in it. Genscript is a fraud. Most Chinese companies are. There is some truth in the faking data by Genscript.

Ever heard of Johns Mansville? Bankrupt because of asbestos. Ever heard of the movie Michael Clayton? Classis corporate cover up not unlike this. How long is JJ going to last and what growth prospects does this stock have now?

Any way to just mute all the $^IXIC people at once?
Janssen and JnJ have made a point to hire folks that will deal specifically with imetelstat and it was put in their PowerPoint presentation recently. So if you really think they won’t continue with Geron you must be delusional. If they didn’t want to continue they wouldn’t have waited all these years and drag along Geron. If they do decide not to then that will be a shocker to everyone including folks at Geron!
You know how JNJ made Talc silky smooth? They added asbestos to it.
"Ensemble (single dose) started Sept 7. Ensemble 2 (double dose) started 2 months later, Nov 15.But both will be reported at same time, end of Jan? Closed half my position at 160.02."

INO got their Covid-19 vaccine into the clinic in Philly and Kansas yesterday. JNJ should just licence that rather than waiting 6 months!
With such urgency on getting vaccines out why does the FDA need until February 26 to review JNJ?

You believe me now.

Vaccine tests halted...SELL !!!
"JNJ will have a ton of cash now to pursue more deals, buy back shares and increase dividends at a faster rate. Earnings momentum will continue. Imo, we could even see 200+ during next year."
"New to JNJ stock... just got in based on the results. Public is vastly underrating the effectiveness. Looking deeper it is obvious this vaccine will be the one that really dents the pandemic. The 28 day effect is very, very good and with the ease of distribution, it will take off quickly."
"JNJ sell off intensifies, and crossing way below 200-day moving average support, how low it goes is anyone's guess."
"If you haven't read this short piece from Bloomberg, it explains how most of the headline-grabbing crazy-jury awards are reversed or dramatically reduced: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-johnson-johnson-may-not-100000896.html Jurors -- and often trial judges too -- can let their emotions cloud their rational judgement capabilities. People don't want to be seen as being ""uncaring"" toward families that are in emotional pain, so they hand out unreal punitive damage awards -- which are later overturned on appeal."
JnJ's vaccine will be approved within days and the price will pop again. This one shot vaccine is more convenient for children and has lasting effect much longer than others and most importantly no allergic reactions.
JnJ - NME PLANNED FILINGS 2018-2021*. In Oncology - Imetelstat. Around the corner.

SHORT IT SHORT IT SHORT IT
Come on out JNJ trollie-moley. Remove another comment you don't like. The caddie shack guy has a golf club with your name on it. LOL.
Great that no asbestos was found in the 60+ independent tests but here is the problem - with the announcement of one test that is now proved a false positive result the share priced loses nearly 9 dollars. With the 60+ tests that clear the talc batch of containing any asbestos the price only regains less than half the loss. Until J&J can totally clear these litigations from their books this will keep happening with bad news/good news cycles and the share price will go precisely nowhere as a result - its the story of the last 2+ years now.
Essentially the latest court decision will bankrupt JNJ and will force the company to liquidate in order to pay off the legal claims.

CFRA downgraded us today with a $20 price cut to $160. How’s that for a company that just released a vaccine to help the world.
$VXRT PR team did the right thing by not releasing P1 results this week- as too much noise from $NVAX and $JNJ releasing their results. Next week the spotlight is for Vaxart alone

Keep in mind the J&J vaccine was tested in both the UK and South Africa. The other vaccines were not! 85 % effective against serious illness or death. I’ll take vaccine that was more widely tested with great results! J&J vaccine!
"JNJ needs to clean up many things and then focus on developments. At this point, JNJ named in many lawsuits for different areas from consumer products to surgical equipment.

"Here's an idea: J&J buys CLVS who just happens to have an FDA approved PARP breast cancer drug that is close to approval for ovarian cancer indication. Settle those cases by offering treatment. CLVS, $5B, as opposed to a few million times 11,000. You might have to give them a few bucks more but you also own a money maker drug soon to be approved for prostate cancer. You can use that for all the guys that powdered their junk and sue. Buy CLVS. Win-Win!"

I DON'T WANT A SECOND RATE COVID SHOT FROM JNJ
"JNJ is the main reason for the overall market decline, not the whole global fears fiasco"
The accusations by JandJ shareholders are so laughably ridiculous it’s insane.When it comes to the asbestos issues there is only two possibilities.1. The johnson internal memos do exist showing higher ups knew their talc contained asbestos.2. The judge or plaintiff fabricated these memos.The funny thing is johnson isn’t even making the second accusation. Instead they are going down the cigarette company defence route“Ya but how do you know it was our particular carcinogenic product that gave you cancer!!”
Anyone got any startups they are watching to invest in?? Been watching $mmedf until a big company like Johnson buys them out one day
Price to earnings at 233! Needs to come down to <30. Good luck will be at <$70 soon
c'mon JNJ - save the world!!!!!!
JNJ didn't want to disclose yesterday if the sick volunteer received the vaccine or placebo. You would think by this morning that JNJ would have come out and said the volunteer received the placebo? So I have to ASSume the volunteer received the vaccine.
"125+ today, yay or nay?"
Asbestos is very hard to detect so quality control to eliminate it is very costly. Talc powder may be critical for JNJ.
Not one time through Obama era did they raise rates now the FED comes in and is Raising it every time just because you're so bitter that Trump is the president and they were backing Hillary imo.

After Hours on Friday took JNJ to $161.00 I expect Monday open will be 163.00 and we ride up all day.
"If 200 million more doses of vaccine were ordered from Pfizer and Moderna, that probably means half of Americans won't have the JNJ vaccine as a choice. NO CHOICE.....NOT RIGHT. I WANT TO CHOOSE and I choose to wait for the JNJ vaccine."

Finally a positive news article just released.

"I have a plan. Let’s not sell on the earnings report! Don’t take profits, make more profits!"
JNJ is down 4.92% to 133.13
Johnson and Johnson is getting sued again. This time the allegation is their baby powder causes ovarian cancer.
Was yesterday's drop due to Sessions war on opioids? How much in to these is JNJ?
Deborah you work for Johnson and Johnson?
Covid is NO joke... don't want the vaccine?? you need to invest in CSV.. they run funeral homes and are trying to keep up with the demand because people don't trust the JAB
Earnings next week. Could be a significant surprise. Dividend hike will also be significantly higher than usual. JNJ should be in the 140s soon.
Nice numbers and raised guidance.
"Okay, so I think most of us would agree the organic growth prospects for needle-moving sales/profits are somewhat limited in the short term, and paying stratospheric valuations for development companies with promising products in Phase II or Phase III trials is a speculative use of capital.So...Why not buy GILD? Up to $85/share ($110B in Market Cap).We have the balance sheet flexibility to pull it off (interest rates are still low), combined with GILD's OWN cash/short-term investments, without issuing any new equity.The acquisition would be immediately accretive, to the tune of at least $5/share under the above scenario...more, factoring in any synergies and cost-cutting redundancies, which could make our shares *POP* by more than $100, assuming no multiple contraction.I'm not suggesting in any way this is GOING to happen, only that it could...and it would be GOOD thing for all involved.Ha ha ha. Especially me."
They obviously are going to deny the accusations! They would have law suits left right and center if they agreed to them. I think they found high traces of asbestos in their products and didn’t care and tried to cover it up rather than sending out a mass recall/ have law suits against them. What a disgraceful company.
Will this jump on Monday? Didn't both Pfizer and Moderna both dip right after approvals?
Canada to make a decision in about a week to implement JNJ vaccine as per Gov statement.
"Between the healthcare sector being beaten down by political rhetoric, and JNJ’s own litigation issues, it’s been a long year. If either of those two issues abate we could easily see a 15-20% gain in 2020."

JNJ...what a beautiful stock at $143
"Its a shame that news reporters ask doctors about HCQ, and get the answer ""we need to test it."" Well South Korea and China have been using it for therapeutic benefits for corona, with great success..And 40 tests by Rigano indicate when used with Azithromycin, it is 100% effective within 6 days.So over a week ago, a State, and several places started testing it. 6 days is long past.WHY HAVE WE HEARD NOTHING FROM THESE TRIALS. Why don't the news hosts press the doctors, and ask them how the trials are going ?Oh, I forgot. The CDC and FDA are enablers of big Pharma. They are now costing American lives as they slow down a process that could be helping people now.If I'm on a ventilator, I am going to invoke ""RIGHT TO TRY."" And then if I survive, I am going to sue everyone who kept me from using it BEFORE I needed a ventilator."
People after car accidents are in so much pain they love Oxy. Too bad they can never quit. Great for Business. Isn't that the way JnJ designed it ?
"JNJ is a Great Short. 52 week Low coming soon. There are a group of attorneys representing 12 states currently and more to follow and 100s of thousands of people who were addicted to oxycodone and oxycontin. In their lawsuit, they will show how JNJ played a roll although not as large as say Purdue Pharma in the opioid crisis. JNJ has settled with one state and better settle with the others quickly because if they do not, expect this company to fall under 100 before the end of the year."

Given the huge potential, the company has set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India, and has almost doubled its footprint in emerging markets in the last five years. These countries are trying to make healthcare accessible to more people primarily by improving insurance coverage. Johnson & Johnson intends to continue working on strengthening its pipeline in Japan as well as China. ( https://www.finstead.com/posts/JNJ-buy-or-sell ) How do you think $JNJ strategies in Asia?"

Insiders BUYING..........................something up soon here.
Sold half my position today. Talk about buy and hold. I have owned J&J since the early 1990s. With this opioid thing looking like it might get worse before it gets better. it’s time to add to my cash position. Good luck to all.
"What's the different between now and before the J&J discontinuation decision? Now GERN owns 100% of the right to Imetelstat worldwide and will receive 100% of Revenue instead of 15% or 20%. It also has FDA Fast Track approval and very positive results in Phase 2, with survival rate of 24 months and still counting. Now moving to phase 3, with 183 million dollars in cash. In addition experts are saying that Imetelstat has the potential to treat numerous other cancers. Imo GERN stock should be going way up not down, with the possibility of a buyout."
Double bottom breakout possibly?

All water companies must be sued immediately for providing water to murderers out there!!!!!!! Have I made my point. Does anyone else not see the ridiculousness of what that knucklehead judge did in OK to set a precedent. We must remove stupid people from positions of power in this country.

"JNJ will consider buying CYDY if they keep stepping on their profits. But the facts are here if JNJ is considering that CYDY has the best of all the therapeutics and could enter in the vaccine arena than yes they would be stepping on their profits and should absolutely buy this little company that keeps on proving results for covid 19. It’s much more than covid 19 and in fact covid was not in the thoughts and is just a bonus when approved, notice I say when not if. The big pharmaceuticals may be keeping this down before a vaccine is approved but CYDY has any day on fast track to be announced for phase 3 the results of critical to severe from the FDA. It will be good and might be exactly what’s holding someone from buying or joining CYDY"

"Johnson and Johnson best pharmacy company, wish I had doubled down on the dip."
"This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (October 15, 2019).Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ), facing lawsuits from more than 100,000 plaintiffs over its product safety and marketing tactics, has taken the aggressive strategy of battling many of the cases in court.And it is losing. A lot.Juries and judges have ordered the health-products giant to pay billions of dollars in several recent trials over claims that J&J's signature baby powder and certain drugs and medical devices injured people, and that its marketing practices fueled the opioid-addiction epidemic.The latest: A Philadelphia jury awarded $8 billion in punitive damages last week to a man claiming his use of J&J's antipsychotic Risperdal when he was a boy caused abnormal breast enlargement. J&J has said it properly disclosed the drug's risks and benefits, and plans to appeal the verdict.In August, an Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572 million to the state for contributing to the opioid-addiction crisis, a judgment the company is appealing. Last year, a St. Louis jury found that J&J should pay $4.7 billion to 22 women and their families who alleged the company's baby powder caused ovarian cancer. J&J has said the talcum powder is safe and doesn't cause cancer; the company is appealing the decision.The New Brunswick, N.J., company faced lawsuits from at least 103,300 people or entities in U.S. courts at the middle of this year, up from the 8,580 plaintiffs pending in October 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal review of J&J's securities filings.J&J discloses the number of plaintiffs for the most significant of its product-liability cases in its filings.The number of talc-lawsuit plaintiffs surged to 15,500 as of June 30, from 1,400 in early 2016, the Journal analysis found. Plaintiffs in personal-injury lawsuits over J&J's pelvic mesh devices for women have declined from a peak of more than 55,000 pending in 2017 but still number about 24,800.J&J is challenging many of the lawsuits, rather than quickly settling, according to lawyers on both sides. ""Their natural reflex is to fight and delay, drag it out as long as they can,"" said Andy Birchfield, an attorney with Beasley Allen in Montgomery, Ala., who has sued J&J over baby powder and other products.The Risperdal damages and some other awards are likely to be reduced by judges, and possibly overturned, on appeal. Yet the losses signal J&J may ultimately have to pay a costly sum to resolve the lawsuits. The opioid litigation alone could cost J&J $5 billion to $10 billion to settle, Wells Fargo analysts have estimated"
"the judge that presided over this case should be barred from practicing law ever again. the people that abused it, the doctors that prescribe it, in the pharmacies that handed out are at fault."
Record of dividend increases yearly and a record of appreciation yearly clearly a powerhouse waiting to explode

"Minting moneyPosted by D4L | Saturday, May 26, 2018 | ArticleLinks | 0 comments » Not all dividend-paying companies make a lot of money, but the ones that do could fetch you solid returns in the long run, simply because a steady flow of cash doesn't just support a dividend but allows a company to grow dividends steadily, year after year. Owning dividend stocks backed by solidly growing cash flows can make you rich. Here are three you might want to consider... In fact, top dividend-paying companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and 3M (NYSE:MMM) have consistently converted 15% or more of their revenues into free cash flows (FCF). Combined, the three companies generated nearly $173 billion in revenues in 2017. That's a lot of money, and a good chunk of it is going into shareholders' pockets. That's why these money-minting dividend stocks deserve your attention."

"IMO BIVI is undervalued at 4 cents per share with two FDA approved orphan drug designations.. ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 28, 2018 / BioVie Inc. (BIVI) (""BioVie"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an Orphan Drug designation to BioVie for terlipressin for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). BIV201 is a new drug candidate currently being tested in a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical study in patients with refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis. The Company previously secured an Orphan Drug designation for terlipressin for treating ascites, and is exploring additional Orphan designation opportunities.""An estimated 12,000 to 33,000 Americans develop HRS each year,"" said BioVie CEO Terren Peizer. ""Our novel drug candidate BIV201 could potentially become an effective treatment option for this condition."" Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome are recognized, Type 1 (HRS-1) and Type 2 (HRS-2), which are categorized by deterioration in kidney function. While HRS-1 involves rapidly progressing kidney failure with a high probability of death (median survival time is only 2 to 4 weeks), HRS-2 is characterized by a progressive but slower deterioration in kidney function, with a longer survival time of approximately 6 months. The FDA has not approved any drug therapies specifically for treating HRS and it represents a critical unmet medical need."

Today is simply a typical overreaction to little to no details of the pause of a phase 3 trail which by the way happens all the time in trials. However the daily false claims by the Covid infected President that a vaccine will be available before the election has put undue pressure on Pharma. Pauses are part of any phase 3 trail but because it's a Covid vaccine the sensitivity is off the charts thus the overreaction today. GLTA
In my opinion every store should take all Johnson and Johnson products off the shelves baby powder everything from the Walgreens from CVS is until further notice so they're not liable that gets sued also

"looks like JNJ should set aside 50 or a 100 billion to take care of this January 22, 2019 Written by: Austin Kirk Add Your CommentsCONTACT A LAWYERHave A Potential Case Reviewed By An AttorneyFIRST NAMELAST NAMEPRIMARY PHONEALTERNATE PHONEEMAIL ADDRESSDETAILS ABOUT CASEJohnson & Johnson now faces talcum powder lawsuits brought by more than 10,000 different individuals in the federal court system, where complaints over the risk of cancer from Baby Powder or Shower-to-Shower products are all centralized before one judge for coordinated pretrial proceedings.Each of the Baby Powder lawsuits and Shower-to-Shower lawsuits raise similar allegations, claiming that Johnson & Johnson has failed to warn consumers for decades about the serious health risks associated with their talc-based product, which have been linked to the development of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.Given similar questions of fact and law raised in complaints filed through the federal court system, the cases are all consolidated for pretrial proceedings as part of a multidistrict litigation (MDL), which is centralized before U.S. District Judge Freda L. Wolfson in the District of New Jersey.In a joint status report (PDF) submitted today, in advance of a conference on January 24, the parties report that the MDL now includes claims filed by a total of 10,023 plaintiffs nationwide. In addition, more than 2,000 additional claims are pending in various state court systems, including California, Missouri, Delaware, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Arizona and Pennsylvania.While Judge Wilson is expected to determine the admissibility of general causation expert witness testimony this summer, over whether plaintiffs have sufficiently reliable evidence about the link between talcum powder and cancer to proceed to trial in the federal court system, a number of state court cases have already gone before juries nationwide in recent years, with a number resulting in multi-million dollar verdicts against Johnson & Johnson for failing to disclose the known risks associated with their products.The largest verdict occurred in July, when a St. Louis jury awarded 22 women $4.7 billion, including punitive damages designed to punish Johnson & Johnson. In addition, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $25.7 million in May 2018, and a New Jersey jury awarded $117 million to a man diagnosed with mesothelioma due to exposure from talcum powder.At least one additional trial is currently underway in California, and a multi-plaintiff claim involving 13 different women diagnosed with ovarian cancer is expected to begin in St. Louis next month. Another trial involving claims for 24 different women is set to begin in April 2019, with third multi-plaintiff case expected to begin in August 2019.Although Johnson & Johnson has maintained that it will continue to defend the safety of their products at trial, and is pursuing appeals in each of the prior cases that resulted in damage awards, the company will face increasing pressure to negotiate talcum powder settlements to avoid a steady stream of trials in the coming months and years.Some analysts have suggested that the recent verdicts are a sign that juries find Johnson & Johnson’s trial defense lacking in credibility, and the company could face substantially greater liability and uncertainty with thousands of cases going before juries if they fail to establish a global settlement program in the future."

"JNJ is at heroic valuations. I am interested in seeing how successful management is at driving growth in JnJ's various segments inc. medical devices, consumer segments and pharmaceuticals. Revenue has been stagnant, but JNJ's valuation is priced for moderate to high growth which I do not see in the companies earnings guidance. With the summer doldrums coming and stocks tending to trade lower, along with the uncertainty w/ Trump's lower tax plans and the Trump administration overall ie. FBI former director James Comey is answering questions form the senate on Thurs re: if Trump tried to interfere with his investigation of conflicts of interest essentially of the Trump administration support for Russian interests verses the US. Comey has far more credibility than Trump, looking forward I suspect his testimony will suggest Trump did try to influence the investigation to protect the Trump admin., thus was obstructing justice with thus grounds for impeachment. Anyone interested in JNJ for a long term hold as this why most people buy it, I would certainly wait for a pullback experienced investors would not by JNJ at these prices I suspect this is largely retail investors bidding the price up.Now is not the time to buy JNJ for certain just wait pullbacks will happen."
Would this type of CHAOS be occurring if Ronal Reagan was POTUS today?
"If people are hoping JNJ is a growth stock they are sadly mistaken. JNJ has never been a growth stock. It's been steady and reliable for decades. If you think one day this stock is going to act like a NFLX, AMZN or FB you are sadly mistaken and probably should sell and buy those stocks. Don't expect something from JNJ that is not advertised. Accept it for what it is or walk away."

I guess opioid drugs which can cause some level of addiction may be subject to lawsuits and legal liability now? America you better get use to sucking up some pain because the courts seem to know what’s better for you than your doctor.

Looking at the PPS from the last 12 months on dividends payouts:12/13/17 $142.77 PPS03/14/18 $133.3406/13/18 $123.50 This was when everyone (well trolls did) thought the bottom fell out.09/12/18 $139.31I haven't seen the latest dividend drop in my account as of this morning but I am sure it will be higher than any of the last 4. Bottom line JNJ continues to provides over $26K annually in dividend payouts reinvested in our investment account. Have been doing this for over 25 years since our oldest daughter was born. Both were the best thing that ever happend in our lives. I think JNJ has split 2-3 times since 1993. Some shares were purchased as low as mid $30 and many at mid $60-$70 when the stock was stuck for years under Weldon. Who knew that would be a blessing in disguise. GLTA.

$608.47Thanks JNJ
"JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV) continues to indicate a functional cure for Hep B is on the horizon, as confirmed by today’s EASL update... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arrowhead-collaborator-janssen-present-phase-113000802.html"
if JNJ ever paid this it would open the flood gates and bankrupt the company - they have no choice except to keep appealing it - over 1000 potential suits already those alone would kill the company - this goes to the supreme court - the other idiots that paid think they are off the hook--that was only the start - companies have to stop feeding the sharks - it only draws a whole school of them
I confirm...we will be GREEN or minimal down at the close...a lot of positive news will come today on this vaccine...a negative market psychology is also weighing on it but that too shall pass...plus...they are a great value company to buy and hold when it goes on sale. Boolean

If you think JNJ is going to split buy BEFORE the split.
JNJ has a partnership with JMIA starting nov 6 (Friday) thru 30th .. great for both ends JNJ and JMIA
JNJ putting money where its mouth is. Buying back 5 billion dollar worth of its own stock. Speaks to the confidence. Add if you can.
Today’s question: Will JNJ go bankrupt or will the poor stockholders only lose 50%?
Lol at the cancer product justifications“But fat in burgers is unhealthy!!!”“But other things can cause cancer like cigarettes!”Yes conscious choices by consumers of unhealthy products is the same as a company selling a product they know has severe cancer causing ingredients but the consumers think is safe and they use on babies and kids.
$10 ps drop since 1/26. What's in that J&J vaccine... talc?
"there is more action at a 7 11 store in the 70,s then in this stock!"
Can their vaccine live up to expectation? The long analysis period makes me nervous.
"JNJ will have their wuhan flu vaccine approved next month, but watch for a 10% correction like the others."
"Sometimes we want to believe the best especially after we’ve invested good money in a stock. In the case of JNJ I’ve held them for years however today’s environment dictates that it’s time to sell some or all of this stock. With Purdue Pharma paying $10 - $12B to settle in the face of some 2000 pending cases, we’ll, this certainly sets a precedent a JNJ will certainly get hit hard.My suggestion is to take profit off the table, wait 6 months, and then decide if a buy-back-in opportunity exists.Remember, you can’t go broke when you’re making a profit!"
"Maybe this board won't have as many ""gern"" posts now?What could have been....."
INO looks nice today... don't miss...
"Yawn.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are far superior in terms of efficacy, and people will prefer those.Common sense."
JNJ will be 250 this year. Multi year breakout according to Modigliani analysis
JnJ the game over vaccine. Just say no jab. 43% efficacy for 60+ seniors
Aspirin works better ....
J&J on the verge of bankruptcy
I think 1Q results should be strong. J&J and the market momentum should start moving in the right direction soon.
I think I’m about to make a rookie mistake . Thinking of selling some shares of jnj to pay off shares I bought on margin. Then sell some of the jnj shares to buy shares of growth stocks that I’m down on to lower cost average. I don’t have much shares of jnj anyways and I’m 33 years old so I can always circle to jnj. Thoughts?
Down a pissant volumeIf you short hope you cover before 130 as I do not want to read your whiny posts
"JNJ Confirms Asbestos DiscoveryAlready bogged down by thousands of lawsuits tied to its leading baby powder product, Johnson & Johnson confirmed on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found tiny amounts of asbestos in one bottle purchased online. The company says it’s investigating whether the bottle originated from one of its warehouses. Nevertheless, it has already recalled a lot containing 33,000 units of the product."
Johnson dumped this P0S hard. Johnson is next. He will sell too.
When will jnj get flu results from vxrt they said the test was done
"Anybody care to venture a guess as to how many inane posts the two resident idiots, kristopher and mr walter white, will clog this MB up with today?"
Keep an eye on VXRT
"will split 3-1 to make a buy market, good luck everybody god bless"
JnJ is done
JNJ one and done....Is the best and quickest way to bring world economy back to normal. Look for other countries to make approval on new contracts from JNJ
Can't break 140. Time to split the stock and encourage younger investors with a lower price.
"The correct word to describe GALT is under valued because it is only 2.4% of the value of MDGL. If both companie's Nash drugs are approved, GALT will outsell MDGL because Nash has no symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage, cirrhosis of the liver. GALT GR-MD-02 Nash drug showed statistical significance in treating patients with cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices and met the objective endpoint in Phase 2B trial. Based on the new right to try law I believe GALT Nash drug can be used to treat patients with esophageal varices, which it showed moderate Improvement in HVPG and significant Improvement in cell ballooning in Phase 2B Trail. I think it's time to buy GALT, before FDA finalized phase 3 trial. DD."
Shame on this company!
"Wow, great news and stock tanks... we need to find a company that will have terrible news so we can profit hugely.... anyone know of any looking at filing BK.... then we buy...."
This new format stinks
Incoming Lawsuits!! Get out while you can!
It appears there are a lot of illegal aliens infecting this board with their idiotic socialist ideas. The easiest way to spot them and put them on ignore is reading their posts and marveling how they butcher the English language in their feeble attempts to sound knowledgable and intelligent.
"I'm no Sherlock Holmes, but this seems suspiciously like tampering. Too much money to be made from screwing around.If someone did purposely do it, hope they get a severe sentence."
"I just found out the big JNJ/Teva opioid trial starting next week is being webcast gavel-to-gavel by Courtroom View Network (CVN). A subscription is required, but looks like a good way to keep up with the trial if you don't want to spend the next 8 weeks sitting in an Oklahoma courtroom. Think this trial will actually go forward?"
Is this stock halted before hours? price hasn't moved.
"JNJ is bangin today! Who says the big blue chip pharma can't move the needle? I'm well over a double, working on a 3-banger. With divs safer and a credit rating better than the US Gov't..."
So should we buy jnj at this price? I feel that it will fall more
I wish the FDA would approve this thing!
There's a reason they call it a blockbuster drug!
this will tank...er was already baked in
JNJ is a great American business. God blesss America
Bought 50k shares yesterday. Keeping fingers crossed
"ok I'm going in I thought it would go down 5 dollars but its down 3 now so this is a win win, no matter what plus it could be at 160 in sep, hopefully"
I guess jnj couldn't help them out . Sad
"I don't think people understand the data around this vaccine. As more data becomes available, people will appreciate this vaccine a lot more."
"It would be nice to get news AM Monday, they have all weekend to crunch data. Time is ticking away and folks are dying."
buying opportunity....?
let the laws suits pour in now
"Don't sweat the data release...the world needs a low cost, 1 dose vaccine that only needs standard refrigeration. It will be approved."
Who was it that wrote that it was probably lab contamination a ways back?
Price has dropped from $148 on Jan 22 to now $122 - $26 per share drop!! Absolute madness and quite annoyed as this is an important part of my long term investments - it will come back. Definitely work in excess of $130 minimum right now
I bet JNJ goes to $130 by next week.
imetelstat = cancer killer
it a st Louis jury.Very liberal.They will appeal
"We got JPM, GS and JNJ tomorrow before open! Should be an interesting morning!"
"Everyone is saying buy including the news and all these jnj ads out of nowhere, what does that tell you?"
Can it go close above 50 day MA at $37.58. If it doesn't then it will find a support around $134 which is low BB.

Great day for JNJ! Congrats longs!
"This is correct, ""In its statement Friday, Johnson & Johnson said ""thousands of independent tests by regulators and the world's leading labs prove our baby powder has never contained asbestos."" The Reuters report is pure nonsense."
Is it true that Johnson and Johnson is secretly working on a cream to cure transgender
buy at 70 in 2021
Is there a list of all the FDA employees somewhere open to the public so we can do our own research of the relationship between Johnson & Johnson and the FDA how do they get your drugs approved so quickly over there?
"back to130.00""s staying short"
"jnj always a good investment, I have been putting $150/mo for the last 20 yrs."
"'JNJ, PLAN to develop...'. I hope they actually work to develop a vaccine and not say PLAN just to pump their stock. Seems a lot of biotechs are riding the corona virus scare and pumping their stocks."
$JNJ doing telemedicine? They need to move forward with this service. Great read with PHGRF and starting to offer cannabis through telemedicine.
Dividend increase. WOW
An article in The Street quotes the NY Times as saying JNJ's single dose vaccine is having production delays and will not be ready until the end of March. They're hoping for approval by the end of January but production is delayed.

Hey kris:WHY has this issue gotten you so wound up?Obviously anything posted here has zero impact on JNJ's share price.Somehow related to gern?Just curious.
"Gap and fade. Sad. Incredibly low volume also. Just no interest. However, it does look like a pretty good dividend play right here. Good yield. And perhaps now trading at the low end of its range. There should be some buyers coming in, but maybe slowly over time. This time next year, definitely higher, maybe by a good amount."

J\J stock great news!! Big upward move Monday! Will absolutely have a positive affect On all travel . Jg
"JNJ is quietly approaching the all time highs set earlier in the year. There will be some resistance in the 148+ area, but once that is overcome, we will be floating up to establish new highs. Long and strong."

Why is JNJ sky-rocketing out of the stratosphere when the Judge has ordered them to pay $582 million to Oklahoma for selling it's Opiods?
Not good when the CFO is leaving
$120's soon $110's LIKE I SAID
Settlement of opiod disaster will occur in 4th quarter....no one knows how much that will effect earnings results....particularly now when IRS is balking about J&J attempting to write off the losses....
I hold JNJ-and Pfizer - and it seemed that Pfizer stock prices have not increased after the virus vaccine was introduced.I am disappointed in the stock price movement of Pfizer. For some reason Pfizer does not increase. I also read that the vaccine under JNJ will be free but staff involved with the administration of the vaccine will be a charging for services but will be reimbursed by insurance company. I am wondering if JNJ stock will have much of an increase if they release a vaccine. I am a long time holder over many year of JNJ.
JnJ is too cheap to ignore or not to buy
Is it time to make a move on JNJ? google awesome-STOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.

i think the law suits into geron will flow into JNJ
This stocks going down hard. Sub 100 soon
"Actually - thee is a reason for the drop -""Shares of Johnson & Johnson fell 3.3% in afternoon trade, enough to pace declines among its health care peers and among the Dow Jones Industrial Average's components, after reports that an appeals court ruled that J&J can't block sales of generic Zytiga while the company appeals the overturning of a Zytiga patent."""
Back under $130 now. That was quick. I'm fine with that. Just another buying opportunity around the corner.

Bought at $129.50. Did I screw up? Should I have waited?
Running up to pre-market earnings tomorrow morning. I think it will hit $175 Cdn within 2-3 weeks based on vaccine optimism.
"Beat earnings, have vaccine coming, and huge increases in sales of medical devices (Total Knee, Total Hip, Spine, Sports Medicine products) coming once elective surgeries open up again. Future looks very bright."

why is jnj dropping so much? isn't this a good stock when the market drops
"@kristopher : You are breathing in asbestos fibers right now! Walk along the street nearest you and you'll be breathing in more asbestos particles than if you sprinkled Baby Powder all around your home. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral; it is everywhere naturally -- and the amounts of it is greater from human pollution, like the asbestos in the dust that has come off of cars' brake linings for decades causing asbestos to exist in heavier concentrations along our roadways. Testing over the last 40 years shows talc used in cosmetic products is, from a safety perspective, asbestos-free. Your fear about ""asbestos in baby powder"" is irrational."
Nice consolidation in progress prior to moving up from here.
After the vaccine the boosters
will follow chesapeake path soon
"Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) released results today from the phase 3 clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, saying that the data showed it was 66% effective against moderate disease, 85% effective against severe disease, and completely prevented hospitalization and death. If you read it in the opposite order and headline it in the opposite order, the stock maybe doesn’t drop?"
The US government promised them 456 million for the successful development of a Covid vaccine. With the approval they should get that payment soon.
this vaccine is worse than my immune system Lol. shorting time!!!!
so I got a question for you why is the stock up on this news? if j&j is going to produce or sell this to the government cost are they going to make any money? oh wait I know if you can produce this in cost you could buy novavax and use their shot as a booster shot and wrap the whole company off uhmmmm.
Looks like a good day. Lets see if we can close above 140.

"One of the major reasons for global warming is population increase. So by developing drugs and vaccines that make people live longer, JNJ is a big contributor of global warming. Are you green ? Then you have to divest JNJ."
This is on a tear. The people who were hoping to get it cheaper will have to rush in now or just stay out.
Gotta love sad people like wooglin. Trying to confuse journalist process with the fact JandJ own memos show them admitting they knew it caused cancer
"The Reuter's accusations are full of half-truths that spins a tale that resembles one of those YouTube conspiracy stories. You can't prove that baby powder caused incidents of ovarian cancer, because there is no science behind those claims...unless you try to weave in some crazy accusation of trace amounts of carcinogens. This is a plaintiff lawyer's playbook, plain and simple. Nearly everyone has used baby powder at one point in their lives, so is JNJ now responsible for all cancers?"
Good buy below 120. Better buy below 115. Just bought some at 119. Solid stock. Hope it goes down more so that I could buy more. Ignore all the noise and accumulate.

$IBIO iBio Estimates ~500 Million Dose Capacity for COVID-19 Vaccine from its FastPharming Facility$JNJ $INO $MRNA
i would have thought it would have dropped 40% by now
"JNJ is being overshadowed by NVAX. It's true JNJ's vaccine is not as effective. However, it only takes one dose to reach efficacy. The news is brand new and the media is only comparing JNJ's vaccine to NVAX's right now, rather than talking about the benefits of one dose. Also, JNJ has no sales agreements signed yet.I think once people start realizing the benefits and potential here, the stock will go up. This has always been a long-hold stock and it will continue that trend."
Chances of 2 doses plus a possible booster for most of the World is ZERO. JNJ's single dose vaccine is a big breakthrough and tens of millions are available.
"Hello all, A simple question- since J&J is already a huge company with so many products etc, a vaccine success may not raise its stock by much. So wouldn't it make more sense from an investment perspective to invest in the other top few companies in this race, such as Novavax, Moderna, or BioNTech/Pfizer? What are the pros and cons of each Thanks!"
why did jnj put imetelstat on the right to try drug?????
Jnj restarting Covid trial on Monday sure is good news.
is JnJ still expecting interim results in early December?
JNJ is the classic safe haven stock and is behaving as such. Everything depends on the volatility and market risk level.
Was just reviewing my broker account and on 3/13/19 the last dividend drip priced in at $139.39. So bottom line the last 3 months during a very volatile time the stock has been flat. Lets see where we are this time in September. GLTA longs.
JNJ shared that they expect an impact on the skin products. this just changed my outlook. this stock has more to go down.
"Well, some changes in the top management is encouraging but too late and not enough. Alex Gorsky has to be replaced since under his leadership many missteps happened that now they are coming to surface. 1- The management was blind to the consumer products while people were rushing to organic products. Why Whole food was going up and AMZN wanted the Whole food. Did JNJ get the signal? JNJ was still using talc and other dangerous materials. Why does JNJ baby shampoo contain any chemical that customers ignore to buy?2- In medical devices, JNJ was ignorant too. Recently, a restaurant has started to use robots to cook hamburger. Where has been JNJ when ISRG, MDT and others were developing robotic for surgeries. Well, too late for JNJ to be a follower instead of a leader. This sector involves software/electronic/hardware that are changing fast. By the time any design gets approval by slow and budget focused JNJ, the system parts are obsolete. This is software, electronic and hardware that is fast lane and almost things changes every 6 months to a year. Some medical devices require constant changes that don't match JNJ slow system since JNJ mentality is drug development that takes years but medical devices needs fast decisions and constant changes. No needs for paper pushers in this sector but constant designs and innovations with no restrictions. 3- In biotech, JNJ was acting so conservative that ABBV came and stole PCYC from hands of JNJHow many other opportunities were lost?"
"The vaccine is NOT FOR PROFIT, so does the stock...."
What is the remedy for irresponsible journalism? Since when does Reuters do sensational and inflammatory journalism? Did someone make some $$$ on the stock move this article triggered? Hmmm.
"https://www.bbc.co.uk,newsTrump says he always tries to tell the truth when he can -BBC News"
I think I’ve identified my best contrarian indicator. Whenever david/jhon/ashley/salmon are here trolling I should immediately put in a JNJ market order.
I’ll be here posting daily and watching the investors cry. As each new lawsuit lowers the sp. it’ll be glorious watching the morally void people cry.

JNJ settles Talc lawsuit in CA mid-trial. Terms not disclosed.
"It's not a question of whether or not one can detect asbestos in Johnson and Johnson's Baby Powder -- one can, as asbestos is a naturally-occurring mineral that is everywhere in trace amounts. Sweep up dust around your house, dig a handful of soil from your yard -- you will find asbestos. The question is only one of HOW MUCH asbestos is in a bottle of Baby Powder -- is the trace amounts greater or lesser than what we'll call (taking a term from nuclear science) the normal ""background"" amounts of asbestos everywhere? And if the amounts are higher than the normal ""background"" amounts, are they high enough to have some impact on people's health?"
Is it possible they purposely continued to sell this product to build a larger consumer base for their cancer drugs?
"Another day and another miserable performance by JNJ while most stocks in the sector were green.As many people noticed here, JNJ has a serious problem and that is the way its management is running the company.JNJ management is chocking the company with their conservative and backward methods. Investors don't expect JNJ grow like AMZN or AAPL but the company should do what it knows to do instead of pretending to be expert in every sector.Here is an obvious example, JNJ is very poor in electronic and software (zero understanding) and when it buys any medical device then it let to become obsolete. Software and electronic are changing almost every 6 months and they are not like drug development that takes several years. Looking at software/hardware as a drug is killing the company. ABT used to have ABBV, but it realized that medical equipment is totally different from pharma sector.They broke up the company into ABT and ABBV and both have performed excellent since then. Backward JNJ management has not realized this fact yet and that is the reason for JNJ poor performance."

Ridiculous. A company getting sue by government for making a product which was approved of
Bunch of scammers attached this message board. All I want to know is when will JNJ start upward move again? What are they going to do with repatriated money? Dividend increase?
"Holding a 132 call for the (15th, don’t understand why it’s still dropping"
Market is overreacting. Governments are still ordering the vaccine and JNJ is still making money. Buy the dip.
Imagine what a 2 dose JNJ will do? It may be 100% and JNJ is testing it now

"The world is waiting for JNJ's one dose vaccine. The price, manufacturing ease, and storage would put JNJ in command, with realistic universal distribution possible. JNJ does not have to make a profit on the vaccine, and will become the world's savior (making up for some past transgressions). It can be less effective than others (Moderna @ 95%, with 2 doses necessary), even as low as 70% (like a flu vaccine), because of the ease of distribution and one dose. We should know in a week or two the results."
"While the vaccine results will be great news for everyone, the company announced early on that they would be producing and selling the vaccine at cost since this was such a critical public health need. It will NOT be a major profit driver moving forward"
JNJ has found a potential vaccine!
"April 26 will be the shareholders meeting at 10 am. We will know the dividend increase that Thursday next week. Just maybe they will surprise us with a larger increase since they said sales will be better next year and the repatriation of the return of big bucks to the USA. I can dream, but think it's in their interest to do a 10% increase bringing the dividend to .92-.93. Maybe I'm fooling myself, but do think it's in the cards to get this behemoth stock heading back towards $150."
Price hikes must be on their cancer drugs from all the demand they engineered with tainted baby powder
What’s the deal? When will we see it break 130
"$JNJ is a top contender to merge with VAXIL BIO. VXL.V had special emergency board meeting on Jan 31. Definitely a merger is going to take place. CEO famous for halting stock don’t get caught.

Regardless of the validity of the Reuter's article about their Talc powder having asbestos and whether they knew or not it's pretty bad news because even IF this was all false or just an exaggerated article from past lawsuits I wouldn't ever buy JnJ baby powder for my baby or kids.
"People are piling on to JNJ as a safe haven. That kind of behavior can go on some more time and fatten up the stock. Who knows, 130 is certainly within sight. If it reaches there, I might certainly take some off to buy back later."
Back down to 115.Topped out.Not enough for R&D.

Same thing happened last January after the Actelion news. Stock dropped from 115 to 111. After that the stock never stopped going up until this ER. I think this is the beginning of another run up to 170-180 level. We have plugged all the gaps and are ready to go!
when does historically jnj split? I mean at what price about $100 or about $200
It's a great news on $JNJ . The bear case on this stock price by JP Morgan is 145

The long term chart tells me that a gap to $95 will be filled. That would also tend to normalize the dividend yield from a historical perspective.

I guess until a few of these lawsuits get decided upon JNJ is going to be ignored by the markets and trend down to neutral. It also doesn't help that Pharma is a hot topic in this election cycle. An easy target for both sides. If we weren't up over 250 pts on the DOW today we would've seen another $1 + loss in PPS. GLTA longs.

"Ttnp, will fight the opioid crisis for you Jnj. Just buy them out already."
Does any woman posting on this board really believe that using baby powder causes ovarian cancer? I find that totally ridiculous. My cousin died at 28 of ovarian cancer and I doubt she ever used baby powder on herself. She did leave three young children and she had the cancer a few years before she died. I just find it totally ridiculous that baby powder could travel up the tubes to get to the ovaries. I just think the law firm is looking for a killing.
BUY here now...while its cheap.ONE SHOT vaccine will be huge for controlling virus and reducing time.

What happened we found out they were poisening us and a trillion $dollar lawsuit settlement?
Vaccine hysteria is a bunch of white noise. JNJ isn't going to see significant revenue from a vaccine so get over it.

For those who don’t know:Phase III Clinical trial data will be available at end of Jan for both ENSEMLE (single dose) and ENSEMLE 2( two dose) studies.Realistically any thing is possible to happen including a bad result or a better efficacy with the two dose study!

"lawyers want everyone to believe everything they say is true. they can always find some so called expert to support their claims. in jnj case they claim baby powder causes cancer. even though the cancer rates have been established as being constant in populations that use the powder and those who didn't. as long as lawyers can sit a jury of clueless people who trend to blame everything on ""evil"" companies they will win no matter what the facts prove. this is what jnj faces right now"
I agree that JNJ management is unable to handle 3 different segments of the business and it is time to break up the company.
"Someone I follow on Twitter summarized it best: -$477m cash with $643m debt-LAG-3 and TIM-3 near zero efficacy-PD-1 undifferentiated from pembro/nivo-Zejula PARP sales growth flattened-Incredible EV difference to $CLVS, neither can compete with $AZN so far-Gave away most upside in mCRPC to $JNJCompany finished as I’ve been saying for months. Watch them raise sub $20 to keep the gravy train going. Cash burn WAY too high."
Money coming back into JNJ
"Dropping 6 days in a row, from $135.38 to $131 or 4%. Meanwhile other stocks like BSX and ABT gained in past 6 trading days.It is time for JNJ to show some strength since dollar is weak and it helps JNJ internationally."
Can we close at 52 week high?
JNJ has lots of offshore money that will make its way back to the US this year!
looks like all in on jnj tomorrow

"At first glance, the results reported Friday from the long-awaited trial of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine might have seemed disappointing. Its overall efficacy — the ability to prevent moderate and severe disease — was reported at 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin American countries and 57% in South Africa.Those figures appear far below the high bar set by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the first two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, which reported overall efficacy from 94% to 95%.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and now the lead medical adviser to President Joe Biden on the coronavirus pandemic, acknowledged the striking difference at a briefing Friday.“If you woke up and you say, ‘Well, go to the door on the left and you get 94 or 95%, go to the door on the right and you get 72%,’ which door do you want to go to?” he asked.But Fauci said that the more crucial measure was the ability to prevent severe disease, which translates to keeping people out of the hospital and preventing deaths. And that result, for Johnson & Johnson, was 85% in all of the countries where it was tested, including South Africa, where a rapidly spreading variant of the virus had shown some ability to elude vaccines.More important than preventing “some aches and a sore throat,” Fauci said, is to fend off severe disease, especially in people with underlying conditions and in older adults, who are more likely to become seriously ill and to die from COVID-19.“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress in human suffering and death in this epidemic that we’re seeing, particularly now,” Fauci said, “as we well know, over the last several weeks, our health care system has been stressed by the number of people that require hospitalization, as well as intensive care.”Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, compared the ability to prevent severe disease to the effects of flu shots, which do not always prevent influenza entirely but can make it less severe.“The same thing seems to be applying here, in a circumstance where this variant is clearly making it a little tougher to get the most vigorous response that you would want to have,” Collins said. “But still, for severe disease, it’s looking really good.”The Moderna vaccine also showed high efficacy, 100%, against severe disease. The Pfizer-BioNTech one appeared to as well, but the overall number of severe cases in the study was too small to be sure.But researchers warn that trying to compare effectiveness between new studies and earlier ones may be misleading, because the virus is evolving quickly and to some extent the trials have studied different pathogens.“You have to recognize that Pfizer and Moderna had an advantage,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said. “They did their clinical trials before the variant strains became very apparent. Johnson & Johnson was testing its vaccine not only against the standard strain but they had the variants.”The best way to stop the spread of mutants and to prevent more new ones from emerging is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, Fauci and other researchers say. Viruses cannot mutate unless they are replicating, and they cannot replicate unless they can get into cells. Keeping them out by immunizing people can shut down the process.In addition to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines already in use in the United States, three more may soon become available: those made by Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has already been authorized in Britain and other countries.Globally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected to play an important role, especially in low and middle-income countries, because it works after just one shot, is relatively inexpensive, and is easier to store and distribute than the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna because it does not share their stringent requirements for freezing and refrigerating."

Be advised mr walter white is one of those GERN bag holders who lost a substantial amount of money investing in that sham of a company JNJ walked away from once they realized their science was junk. Anything he says is biased against JNJ and designed to hopefully get you to sell out of one of the most stable companies in the world.GLTA JNJ Longs. Shorts can go pound it.
thank God I sold it at 163
I have had money in the market since 1992 and will always have investments in equities. JNJ is among the top.

Right now though it's for emergency use approval."
penger
For all the Shorts betting on JNJ vaccine having 95% effectiveness. No one will know until late January when early data available. Look at Sanofi trial data vaccine ineffective due to error. What if PFE and MODERNA only 95% effective vaccine until 4th quarter? Don't count your chickens before they hatch!

"BUY BUY BUY, holding around 2,000.000 in JNJ. STRONG and FIRM"
"20min ago: Johnson & Johnson pauses coronavirus vaccine trials after unexplained illnessMarketWatch Mike Murphy,MarketWatch•October 12, 2020The drug maker announced Monday night that the 60,000-patient, late-stage trials have been put on hold and new enrollment has been halted, citing “an unexplained illness in a study participant.”"
"Speaking of technical, we are at extremely important and exciting point. Why? Because JNJ technical is very strong at this point but also there is a stiff resistance. We are clear and above 20, 50 and 200 MA that is very bullish. In addition, we are clear and below Upper BB ($134.19) but above Mid BB ($129) which is very bullish point and JNJ can go to Upper BB easily in near future.However, We have been at this point for a few times and JNJ struggled to pass it a few times until we broke it once in the past. So, the reason for hesitation is this resistance but eventually, JNJ will overcome this resistance and will head to at least $140. It may take a few days or a few times but it is heading to $140 one way or another. All JNJ needs some times and some patience. Oh, all moving averages are trending up and 50 MA will cross 200 MA in near future that is called Golden Cross. Most investors/traders will see it as a very bullish point and they are encouraged to put more money in the stock to ride and enjoy their gain. Good luck."
Strong finish for the week. Very close to that 140 level again. We will keep climbing the wall of worries of which we have our share here. GLTA longs!

UNH also nice beat. Should help the sector
JNJ was ~$148 before Q4 numbers were released in early 2018. Amazing how far we have fallen. Over $20/share. BTW both quarters beat. Thank God other wise we would be below $100 today. Not sure what the catalyst will be to get back to the $140s. Meanwhile for those who reinvest their dividends we all get a few more shares at these price points.
FYI if interested in listening to day 3 of trial. Seems JNJ person on stand was trying to convince judge that JNJ was trying to educate doctors on opioids rather than trying to increase their sales. I don’t think anyone was convinced. She probably would have gained more credibility to be more honest and state they were trying to increase sales as all companies do but only if the opioid would improve the person’s pain.

Based on this weeks rollercoaster ride since Q1 earnings (basically flat) it looks like the market is not totally convinced that JNJ's grow story is that compelling paired with uncertainty over pending lawsuits. Will be interesting where we go from here. Like many JNJ investors that have been in this stock for over 25 years I take day to day volatility with a grain of salt. If the stock was $150 today I wouldn't sell any faster than selling it when it dropped to $127 after the Reuters report. right now I am looking forward to the dividend increase this month.

ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS NOT FAR AWAY TAKE IT TO THE BANK
"Just a few thoughts spawned by reading these posts. The FDA only requires 51% efficacy to be acceptable. Many news reports have smeared efficacy results together causing quite a bit of confusion. Intended result? Your call. Some constants to live by. A 2 dose vaccine will always yield higher efficacy than a single dose. A single dose will always require the highest dose tolerable to achieve the desired result. mRNA vaccines will always require extreme cold storage. DNA vaccines are always less cold dependent. Vaccine trial results today reflect major concerns at the time the study started. Future concerns will focus on 1) how well a vaccine is against mutation variants 2) long term and possibly mucosal immunity 3) midstream manufacturing shortages, 4) portability. In short, our latest greatest data may be obsolete in just a few short days/weeks/months."

"$JNJ could be looking to Buyout EVOK EVOKE Pharma’s newly only approved Gimoti for Diabetic Gastro relief. Last year world wide sales were 10 billion. This would fit right in with their other lines. CEO Gonyer has always sold off his successful FDA drug approvals. Bausch is also looking to acquire the company. On Monday Evoke will present at the H.C. Wainwright investors convention. Look for a large movement in share value as their are only 22 million shares. The word on the street is a buyout could be for $25. to $35. a share. All analysts have a strong buy rating at $10.00 price tag. Sales for the company start in October, which greatly increase the value, even if a buyout takes a little longer to happen. Bullish"
Does anyone know how many more appeals JNJ has for this latest award of $2.1?
Remember JNJ is more than just a COVID-19 vaccine producer
U.S. Democratic Senator Patty Murray sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday seeking information related to allegations in a Reuters Special Report that the healthcare company knew about the presence of asbestos in its talc-based baby powder.
"The following is from ""Bloomberg Intelligence Watch: J&J Talc Suits""""2. Who's Favored""J&J.J&J is favored in talc lawsuits on the science, though bad documents and mixed verdicts could make settlements more likely. J&J ins't expected to change its poor trial record in Missouri, but a $4.7 billion judgment could be reversed based on jurisdiction, giving the company settlement leverage. Documents allegedly showing J&J learned of ""talc/ovary"" problems, trace asbestos in talc, and the fact that talc and asbestos share similar properties could hurt. Causation will still be hard to prove. (02/19/19)"""

JnJ should have sold off the brand 10 years ago. Only good news is that the options Sandy Peterson was loaded up with aren’t worth much...they always said these were merit based, so it seems right."

Don’t fight the tape
JNJ is up 4.98% to 131.66
Daily reminder this stock made money selling a cancerous product to be used on kids and babies.
Oversold! IMHO. JNJ received subpoenas from the Department of Justice regarding this back in February. They have been working with the Department of Justice since then. It is hard to imagine a Fortune 500 company would market talc without testing it.
going straight to zero
Expect the stock to inch up as we head towards the ex dividend date May 25.

Just pulled the trigger on 200 at $128.85. This PR mess is going to settle down. The overall market is not helping. At the end of the day JNJ's fundamentals have not changed.

"Next week on Tuesday, JNJ will report its Q3 earnings.Regardless of miss, beat or in line, most stocks go down unless the current and future income are raised significantly. Pharma stocks depend on future and pipeline. So they tend to go down more.JNJ may miss after all restriction on drug prices, tariff, competitions, lawsuits and many other factors.After all, the technical has become very weak and the market is in correction. The conclusion is to wait for earnings to get better view. If JNJ is a good investment then a paying a little bit more for shares is ok. Consider it as insurance. But if JNJ miss and future is not encouraging then you save a lot of money."

I am adding to my JNJ position. This stock will pop when they complete the clinical trials and release the Caronavirus vaccine. Clinical trial for COVID-19 vaccine is in progress. JNJ has a three month head start on everyone else.
Johnson & Johnson said it will make 20 million doses of the vaccine available in March and an additional 80 million by the end of June to fulfill a contractual agreement with the government. Taxpayers paid nearly $500 million to help develop the vaccine and $1 billion to produce and deliver these 100 million doses.
"Still remember how JNJ went 120 two years ago when the lawsuit started. Now case almost settled, no reaction?"
Any mesothelioma victims?
"This vaccine has many advantages, would have liked higher efficacy but all things considered will be in great demand globally."
"The NIH research consisted of two parts. The first part began in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses, and had a budget of $3.7 million. The program funded Shi Zheng-Li, a virologist at the Wuhan lab, and other researchers to investigate and catalogue bat coronaviruses in the wild. This part of the project was completed in 2019.A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. The project was run by EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit research group, under the direction of President Peter Daszak, an expert on disease ecology. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th, Politico reported. Daszak did not immediately respond to Newsweek requests for comment."

Any hope for JNJ? Jnj started the month in the mid $150’s and as we close the month we are approaching the low $140’s. The stock is currently at a one month low of $143.05 and down 8 percent for the month of May. So basically this month you are down 3 years of dividends. Is JNJ a buy at these levels or that is need to go further down to the high $130’s? I was fortunate to get out between $149.30 and $149.80. I keep looking at the stock but it seems it can not find a bottom. Any thoughts?
still a buy here

(NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced it has identified a coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ proprietary nanoparticle technology, and will initiate a first-in-human trial in mid-May. Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant will be incorporated with NVX-CoV2373 in order to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.NVX-CoV2373 was shown to be highly immunogenic in animal models measuring spike protein-specific antibodies, antibodies that block the binding of the spike protein to the receptor and wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies. High levels of spike protein-specific antibodies with ACE-2 human receptor binding domain blocking activity and SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies were observed after a single immunization. In addition, the already high microneutralization titers seen after one dose increased eight fold with a second dose. High titer microneutralizing antibodies are generally accepted evidence that a vaccine is likely to be protective in humans.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-identifies-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-100010906.html"

"Johnson & Johnson Plunges Johnson & Johnson JNJ shares dropped the most in more than 15 years Friday following a Reuters report that said the company knew for decades that its iconic baby powder sometimes contained asbestos and failed to alert authorities. Johnson & Johnson reportedly knew both its raw talc and finished powder tested positive for traces of asbestos, a carcinogen, citing documents linked to a court case that saw a jury in Missouri award $4.7 billion to 22 women who said that the products contained asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. Reuters also said the company tried, unsuccessfully, to influence plans by U.S. regulators to reduce the amount of asbestos that could legally remain in some cosmetic talc products. ""The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory,"" Johnson & Johnson said in an emailed statement to TheStreet. ""Simply put, the Reuters story is an absurd conspiracy theory, in that it apparently has spanned over 40 years, orchestrated among generations of global regulators, the world's foremost scientists and universities, leading independent labs, and J&J employees themselves."" ""We note that all issues reported were previously disclosed as part of talc litigation discovery. As we think about the risk to JNJ here, we see today's move as an over-reaction, especially from a longer-term perspective,"" said JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott. ""At the same time, talc does not seem to be an issue that is going to resolve quickly for JNJ and we would expect shares to trade at a lower multiple pending further clarity on the company's exposure to this issue (which could be an extended period of time)."" Since the publication of the Reuters story, Johnson & Johnson lost all of the stock's year-to-date gains and wiped out $39.5 billion in market value, reported TheStreet's Martin Baccardax. When the market closed, the company was down over 10% to $132.86 a share."

"What's wrong with JNJ? Market is at all time high and JNJ keep dropping. The worst thing is that the JNJ management is hiding and not even one word about anything. In spite of bragging that what did this and that, JNJ is behind in making any vaccine. PFE was not in the game when JNJ started its Covid vaccine and now ahead of the game."
"One day we will all look back at this ... and say, ""Can you believe JNJ was 110?"". (wink)"
"If the market was neutral today, this would have gone to $135."
More countries are going with JNJ after many side effects are discovered in the PFE vaccine. MRNA will not better than PFE either. One global vaccine will take over all and that's JNJ vaccine. I wait for it.

We were so excited about those data for a lot of reasons. I believe that it suggested this drug is doing what we wanted to do. In fact, doing a bit faster than we expected. And so we are going with those data and probably some additional data to the fda to talk about changing endpoints and changing size and maybe changing the duration of the study. Until we have those discussions, it’s probably not appropriate for us to speculate on the specifics of what those changes could be. I don’t want to get out in front of this conversation. We’ve had a very good collaborative relationship with the fda as it relates to this program, we expect this to continue to be collaborative, and I just don’t want to jeopardize that. I want to have the discussion, an open discussion with them and then come back to you and tell you what we have decided together.”then Mariano: ""BIG STEP, $ARWR ARO-AAT showing polymer reduction both in liver cells and in serum. $TAK must have been convinced Arrowhead Pharma’s drug for A1AD will be a winner!

"Like JNJ, think this vaccine has real promise, has 72-85% efficacy in U.S., with different strains-think it's 57% but other vaccines have not said theirs is 100% against strains- and is ONE shot only, when you look @ the problems with the 2 dose vaccines in some states.

JNJ is a healthcare giant trading at an oversold status with an RSI of 33 and a P/E of less than 20.This company is pharmaceutical icon in America. It seems that Wall street is FIXED ! The current drop comes in the face of much good news and earnings that were great that beat expectations.

"WOOHOO 2/26/21 @ 2:44 PMA Food and Drug Administration advisory committee is expected to endorse Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine later Friday, with panel members framing the shot as a crucial third option to vaccinate millions of Americans.The vaccine appears broadly effective against the virus and is especially good at preventing severe cases, according to data presented by FDA staff and Johnson & Johnson at the meeting. And because the vaccine is given as a single dose and is easy to ship, it presents an appealing profile for public health officials struggling to vaccinate hard-to-reach or skeptical populations — groups of people increasingly in the sights of state leaders launching outreach efforts."

Well it's good news bad news . The Good news is mid April things will be closer to normal with most of the vulnerable vaccinated and social restrictions lifting. Unfortunately the bad news is the South African variant.B.1.351 WILL TAKE HOLD IN AUGUST AND WE WILL BE BACK TO SQUARE 1. this variant is very good at evading the current vaccines and new ones will have to be made to combat it. . Unlikely to be much in person learning for the 2021 - 2022 school year.

Looks like the market is a little concerned about the $2 million talc settlement. Although the dollar amount seems insignificant the optics looks concerning for the thousands of other similar lawsuits for JNJ. The wall of worry continues and its holding back a stock that should be above $150.

"There’s another potential problem. Just as human bodies develop immune responses to most real viral infections, our bodies also develop immunity to adenoviral vectors. That makes booster shots of adenoviral vector vaccines problematic. Upon a second injection, our bodies will unleash an antibody attack on the vaccine itself. And since adenoviral vectors are based on natural viruses that some of us might already have been exposed to, the vaccines might not work for everyone."

Wondering why JNJ getting killed lately. Any news or just manipulation?
Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned JNJ in the daily newsletter.
JNJ reached an all time high at 152.73
"Since July 12, healthcare & pharma is not doing well. JNJ cause or effect? Anyways, tide may change in the upcoming days ."
Has JNJ stated what they are going to do with the repatriated money they brought back? Many opportunities right now. Acquisition maybe?
"Following what I heard from Israël vaccination with Pfizer-Biont, the efficacy after the first dose is 52% or even below, that's why the second dose is needed. J&J efficacy is 66% globaly . Would that means that J&J vaccine is more efficient than others ?"
"The reality is JNJ has limited growth, but a steady dividend. I do not think pharmaceutical drug sales will increase significantly as people are increasingly focusing on prevention and living healthy lifestyles thus they healthier, as well drugs only act as band aids verses providing solutions to an illness, as most people seek complete recovery this means less demand for drugs, but more for good vitamins not the synthetic kind but food grade, personal trainers, yoga facilities, exercise cloths ect...But I think medical devices and consumer products will continue to have steady sales, thus with this very, very, very overvalued US market JNJ is relatively a buy albeit JNJ's price to book, price to sales are both high but with people buying NFLX with a PE of 198, flat revenue but increasing subscribers suggesting to low a subscriber price or something odd is happening and stratospheric debt, the market is out of sync, and I think well overdue for a correction."

"JNJ isn?t saving anything. Pfizer/Moderna already has. 94% effective. Nobody wants a #$%$ vaccine that?s 60% + effective. Have you wondered why the stock price has fallen in the last month??? The other vaccine manufacturers already saved us, which is why US bought all its vaccine from them"

See u at 60
I've looked at what the government has ordered and my chances of getting the vaccine in the first quarter next year is probably dependent on JNJ's successful January results and there is a good chance that will happen. JNJ has told us they plan for 1 billion doses next year which is great but my question is do we have any idea how much they plan to produce through the first quarter of 2021?

"I’m a retired guy. All my working years I bought JNJ. Why? They are one of the few, if not the only one with a AAA rating. A diversified health care company, consumer products, medical devises and pharmaceuticals. A very strong pipeline with a very strong commitment to research. Buy for your retirement, not for lunch tomorrow."
This is about to break out
And I’m up 7% just today :) hahahahahahahahaha
"Anyone worried about $JNJ data release being better than ours, hope you did your DD. There's no way they will have higher efficacy. Their safety profile isn't as good. They have no answer for long term immunity. And the best part, they're not taking any profits on EUA vaccines hahahaha. So if I were a shareholder at J&J, today I take profits. This is coming back down just like PFE did. I've never been worried about the J&J vaccine as a competitor. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/jj-can-produce-up-to-900-million-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-by-april-2021-if-trials-go-well.html"
What caused over a $2 drop in less than 15 minutes? Somebody with a lot of stock wanted out quickly for some reason. Not the smartest execution in a huge up market. But given volumes if they just spread out over the rest of the day would have saved themselves $1-$2 a share x 750000 to 1M shares or over $1M!

"I don't trust MRNA and PFE efficacy rates. This the reasons as scientists noticed:The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with the coronavirus, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger the first analysis of their data.Early in the trials, infection RATES WERE LOW. With a surge in infections around the globe in October and November, trial participants became infected more quickly. So, if MRNA & PFE get the data after November, they will see the efficacy of much much lower. That's the reason AZN came out with lower efficacy."
JNJ gonna dip below $150

J&J is the Sherman tank in the end this helped us win the war it’s all about logistics the aim is to get as many people some protection as quickly as possible and that’s what J&J does ... it’s the easiest in terms of scalability, mass manufacturing and overall logistics ....additionally it protects against 85% Of severe infections hospitalizations and after a month and zero deaths after a month .... maybe college age / younger group are fine with jnj ... riskier older comorbidity groups get moderna or pfizer etc . Another tool in the arsenal to battle the virus ...so it’s a win￼"

"Now an upgrade. Enjoy!Analyst Actions: Johnson & Johnson Price Target From RBC Raised to $144 From $138, Outperform Reiterated6:55 AM ET, 09/22/2017 - MT Newswires06:55 AM EDT, 09/22/2017 (MT Newswires) -- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) received a price-target increase Friday from RBC Capital Markets, citing ""positive feedback from recent management meetings and better-than-expected prescription trends for key pharmaceutical brands in the current quarter.""The new price target is $144 per share, up from $138. In comparison, the stock closed Thursday's session at $131.75. RBC kept its investment rating on the stock at outperform. The firm said it sees Q3 results "" as a catalyst for the shares and would recommend adding to positions at current levels.""The price-target boost came as RBC also raised its estimates for Johnson & Johnson's Q3 revenue and earnings per share, as well as for its 2017 revenue and 2018 revenue and EPS, saying it believes the manufacturer of health-care products will report Q3 results ahead of consensus estimates. The firm now estimates Q3 worldwide revenue at $19.35 billion, up $160 million from its prior estimate, while it boosted its estimate for Q3 EPS to $1.79 from $1.75.RBC also sees an upward revision to 2017 guidance as likely. It expects Johnson & Johnson to reaffirm constant-currency revenue growth guidance of 5.5% to 6.0%, but also sees the company raising its guidance for reported revenue amid further weakening in the US dollar since Q2 results. For EPS guidance, RBC is predicting an increased range of $7.18 to $7.23 versus the current guidance for $7.12 to $7.22.The firm said it expects Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical segment to drive upside to current Street estimates for Q3 amid ""superior prescription trends for several large brands."" It noted its analysis of QuintilesIMS data shows prescription growth for most major brands accelerated in July and August.For the company's medical-devices and consumer segments, RBC expects ""modest"" organic revenue growth. In medical devices, the firm highlighted that ""a few businesses are doing well (e.g. electrophysiology, advanced surgery, vision care), a few are performing in line (e.g. orthopedics, excluding spine) and a few others are struggling (e.g. spine, specialty surgery)."" It noted recent hurricanes could also put negative pressure on the surgical franchises.In the consumer segment, RBC said beauty and over-the-counter products are the primary growth drivers, while the other product categories including baby care and oral care are under pressure, especially in the US. ""Management expects new products should lead to better performance in both segments, but the improvement may not be evident in 3Q,"" the firm said."

"FDA approves Amgen's biosimilar to J&J's rheumatoid arthritis drugDec 6: R**euters - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Amgen Inc's biosimilar copy of Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, according to the regulator's website.The biosimilar, Avsola, has the same chemical components, dosage form and strength as Remicade and would treat a range of autoimmune disorders.Amgen did not give the pricing of the drug immediately, but said is confident to compete in the biosimilar market.With the regulatory approval, Avsola joins the existing biosimilars to J&J's drug, including Pfizer Inc's 2017 approved Ixifi, Celltrion Inc's Inflectra and Merck & Co and Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd's Renflexis.Avsola will add to Amgen's growing biosimilar unit, which could be $2 billion over the next several years, says Jefferies analyst Michael Yee.However, Yee doesn't see the drug as a major driver of sales for Amgen right now.Avsola was approved for all eligible indications of Remicade, including the treatment of bowel disease, Crohn's disease and skin disorder plaque psoriasis, the agency said.Biosimilars are medicines considered highly similar to an original drug and are cheaper alternatives to biologic products.The blockbuster drug Remicade, approved in the United States, European Union and other regions, has steadily lost market share among patients enrolled in the Canadian province of Quebec's public drug program and elsewhere, where biosimilars have been slowly catching on with doctors and patients."

Should receive 10 million dollar milestone payment soon.Azedra recently approved by the FDA, which is expecting estimated sales of 200 to 300 million dollars plus per year in the US, plus patients coming to the US for treatment. Azedra has been proven to save lives.PyL phase 3 for prostate cancer imaging is expected to start by end of 2018, based on PyL positive trial results, PGNX very optimistic opinion and the FDA fast concurrence & decision to move to phase 3.Data from compassionate use of I-131 1095 indicates it was well tolerated and demonstrated markedly reduced PSA levels and bone pain in a group of heavily-pretreated advanced prostate cancer patients following a single cycle of treatment. “We are pleased, following our discussions with FDA, to move this important therapeutic agent into a phase 2 study in combination with enzalutamide in chemo-naïve patients with mCRPC,” stated Vivien Wong, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Development at Progenics. “1095 delivers a targeted radiation dose to prostate cancer cells utilizing iodine-131 as the payload. Iodine 131 is an attractive agent to use because its physical properties of longer range and higher energy could potentially improve efficacy for bulky lesions and lesions that have lower PSMA expression. Iodine has been used widely in other cancer therapeutics, is broadly available with a ready supply and known safety profile. We look forward to evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1095 in this Phase 2 study.”"

"As expected, the resident angry moron who lost his life savings in GERN, posted more false information, saying that there were no rate hikes in the ""obama era"". Aside from rate cuts being needed to stop the 45% free fall in the market, which was a culmination of the bursting of the housing bubble, caused by toxic mortgages, allowed by lack of regulation under the Bush administration, the statement itself us simply false. There were 2 rate hikes, 1 in 2015 and 1 in 2016. Remember, just because you may THINK something is true because it FEELS right. THOUGHTS and FEELINGS are not FACTS...especially when you are either to dopey to understand this concept and to lazy to actually look up this fact.This describes the type of person, who vents their frustrations at stupidly over investing in a mega risk micro cap biotech, and looking for a scapegoat for their own stupidity."

Warren Buffett is too rich to own these stocks, but they are fine investments for smaller investors.Anders Bylund, Sean Williams, And Matthew DiLallo(TMFZahrim)Jul 11, 2017 at 8:47AMEnormous wealth has its downsides. Small investors like you and I can build game-changing wealth in stocks no billionaire would ever touch. We asked three Foolish investors to share some of the best names that Warren Buffett and George Soros wouldn't or simply couldn't trade. Read on to see how CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust(NYSE:CORR), Magic Software Enterprises(NASDAQ:MGIC), and Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) fit that bill.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The little software-building company that couldAnders Bylund (Magic Software Enterprises): You won't find a whole lot of interest in Magic Software Enterprises from deep-pocketed investors or the largest mutual fund managers. The company is simply too small and too thinly traded to move the needle for an investor with huge assets.To wit, the provider of software development and marketing solutions sports an average trading volume of less than 48,000 shares per day. Trading at roughly $8 per share, that works out to a daily dollar volume of roughly $385,000. That's small enough that individual investors can wield enough capital assets to account for more than 10% of the daily volume in a single trade. It's also small enough that a million-dollar buy or sale would soak up several days' worth of current orders, with market-moving results.Add in Magic Software's relatively small market cap of $360 million, and you'll have a complete set of big-money handcuffs. This is a thinly traded small cap, best left to smaller mutual funds or individual investors for the time being.Only 5% of Magic Software's shares are held by insiders and very large shareholders today. The largest mutual fund holding is a 0.7% stake held by the Westcore International Small Cap Fund, for a grand total of $2.1 million. The largest owner overall is a hedge fund called Denver Investment Advisors, whose entire asset base adds up to just $2.2 billion.Of course, none of this matters unless Magic Software qualifies as a stock worth investing in. In my view, it's at least worth a closer look by growth investors. The Israel-based company's shares are trading at a very reasonable 13 times forward earnings. Those earnings are expected to increase by 17% next year and an average of 14% over the next five years. Don't back up the truck to invest your life savings here, but Magic Software could be a quiet little winner over the next few years.This small-cap clinical-stage drug developer appears ripe for the picking Sean Williams (Geron): Clinical-stage biotech company Geron could be an intriguing stock for investors to consider, and it's certainly one that'll stay off the radars of billionaires.To begin with, it's a small-cap company with a $457 million market cap. Most billionaires prefer to buy larger companies and often view small caps as risky, volatile, and unproven. Second, Geron's share price is less than $3, which is a level often associated with risk and volatility. And finally, Geron is a wholly clinical-stage drug company, which means there's potential for wild share-price swings, and the need for investors to stay on top of clinical data. Most billionaires, including Buffett, simply don't have that kind of time to devote to keeping up with clinical trials.However, billionaires' loss can be your gain. Geron has but one compound in clinical development, imetelstat, as a treatment for myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndrome. But this one compound demonstrated jaw-dropping results in early stage clinical trials for myelofibrosis a few years back.Previous therapies targeted at MF have focused on the symptoms caused by the orphan disease, such as enlarged spleen and anemia, and done absolutely nothing to slow or halt disease progression. Imetelstat, however, demonstrated both partial and complete responses in MF patients, suggesting that it could become the standard of care in treating MF. The lone Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy on the market specifically for MF is Incyte's Jakafi, and it's on track to generate around $1.05 billion in sales this year at the midpoint. That $1.05 billion could almost entirely be imtelstat's if it excels in ongoing studies.Geron also isn't navigating the development of imetelstat alone. It's partnered with Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Geron and J&J worked out a deal worth as much as $935 million in 2014, which netted Geron $35 million upfront and gave it the opportunity to earn $900 million in various development and regulatory milestones. It's also entitled to a handsome royalty on net sales of imetelstat, if approved. Considering how versed J&J is in bringing new drugs to market, Geron may be able to sit on its laurels if imetelstat is approved, push its costs down substantially, and bank significant profits based on royalty revenue. It is also possible that J&J could just choose to acquire Geron if imetelstat is a success.Billionaires won't be going anywhere near Geron, but it could be ripe for the picking for biotech-savvy, patient investors.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.An income growth stock you won't want to missMatt DiLallo (CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust): Billionaire investors tend to avoid smaller stocks because they'd need to buy an outsized stake in the company for it to make a meaningful difference in their portfolio, which alone could move the stock. Because of that, most uber-wealthy investors would likely avoid buying CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, as its current market cap is less than $400 million.However, just because most billionaires wouldn't bother with CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust doesn't mean you should avoid this high-yielding energy-focused REIT. That's because the company offers investors an eye-popping yield of nearly 9%, with plenty of upside potential as it buys additional assets.Supporting that payout is a growing portfolio of mission-critical infrastructure properties that it leases to customers under long-term agreements, which provide the company with stable cash flow. While the company endured a period of uncertainty during the oil market downturn after two large customers went through bankruptcy proceedings, CorEnergy's leases survived untouched.Adding further stability to its payout is the company's conservative payout ratio, which has averaged around 75% of its adjusted funds from operations over the past year. Finally, CorEnergy has an excellent balance sheet, evidence by a low debt-to-capitalization ratio of 24%, which is below its 25% to 50% target.Because of its healthy dividend coverage and ample financial flexibility, CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust has the capacity to make a couple of acquisitions per year going forward, targeting deals in the $50 million to $250 million range. Given its small size, these deals could be needle-moving, potentially providing the company with the ability to grow its already generous payout at a brisk pace. That combination of income with upside makes CorEnergy a compelling stock to consider, even if it's too small for most billionaires.Anders Bylund has no position in any stocks mentioned. Matt DiLallo owns shares of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust and Johnson & Johnson. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Johnson & Johnson."
"With a already huge Market Cap and huge float and a lot of the approval baked in, it will be hard to move this pig much."
"@Wooglin, Value is crying but I believe it is beyond help."
This stock should be at 160.
"New 52 week Lows coming next month. JNJ should have paid out like the others, but instead hired some #$%$ who thought she new more than the judge. Big Mistake. She'll cost the company Billions and all her appeals will fall in deaf ears. Just wait until the Ohio case begins."
Just wait until the Ohio trial. Minimum $2B settlement.
Buy JNJ when others are fearful
good blue chip stock on sale to stash away long term go johnson baby
J&J now given up an entire year's gains - very disappointing - but div yield is still strong
JNJ 85% good to keep from getting too sick or dying plus no need for freezer just regular refrigeration. One shot and can produce the vaccine very fast. Will be used all over the world. Stick with JNJ.
Nice upgrade today buy JPM with a target of $140
"It is absurd to assert JNJ would allow asbestos in Baby Powder. Talc and Asbestos are found in similar geological deposits. They figured out over 100 years ago how to tell them apart. JNJ is the target of ambulance chasing lawyers, because they have one of the best balance sheets in the world."
170 today?
Good news prices in?
Long JNJ. Good things in the pipeline!
JNJ will be lower next week
"Excellent results from a phase 1/2a JNJ COVID-19.Johnson & Johnson Posts Interim Results from Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of its Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine CandidateInterim analysis from Phase 1/2a First-in-Human trial supports further clinical development of investigational vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735 (also known as Ad26.COV2.S)Interim analysis from the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate (JNJ-78436735) was posted today on the pre-print server medRxiv.The data demonstrate that a single dose of JNJ-78436735 induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in nearly all participants aged 18 years and older and was generally well-tolerated. Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.The ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial is designed to study the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and as single and two-dose schedules. The interim analysis showed that a single dose induced a robust immune response and was generally well-tolerated. These data are consistent with preclinical studies, published in the scientific journal Nature, which showed that a single dose of the vaccine successfully prevented subsequent infection and provided complete protection in the lungs of nonhuman primates.Based on these findings, the single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate of 5x1010 virus particles (vp) has been selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial. The Company also plans on running a Phase 3 clinical trial of a two-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 versus placebo later this year.The full set of results will be published once the complete Phase 1/2a trial data are available.Immune Response DataSeroconversion (the development of detectable antibodies) was observed in 99 percent of participants aged 18-55 years of age. 98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.Immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response) data from participants aged 65 years of age and above were available for the first 15 participants at the time of this post, with strong humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in all elderly participants who received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.Safety and Tolerability DataInterim safety data from the Phase 1/2a trial indicated that the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate (grade 1 and grade 2) in severity and generally occurred on the day of vaccination with symptoms generally resolving that day, or the following day. Two serious adverse events were reported, the first for hypotension which the investigator determined to not be vaccine related, and the second was a participant with a fever who was hospitalized due to suspicion of having COVID-19 but recovered within 12 hours. No grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events, solicited or unsolicited, were reported in any cohort, and no participant discontinued the study due to an adverse event. The analysis showed there was a trend toward higher reactogenicity with the higher vaccine dose and with younger age.In clinical studies investigating vaccines, it is well known that vaccines often induce local and systemic side-effects that are mild, to moderate, and transient without consequences. In vaccine clinical trials these type of side effects are actively sought (""solicited""). The interim safety data in this Phase 1/2a study is blinded to ensure participants and trial investigators are not made aware which participants received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate versus a placebo.Study DesignThis Phase 1/2a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate at two dose levels, administered intramuscularly as single-dose or two-dose schedules, eight weeks apart, in healthy adults 18-55 and greater than 65 years of age. The study is ongoing at multiple clinical sites in Belgium and the United States."

How's that 5 billion buy back going or did it turn to 5- the 4.7 billion??? They owe to victims are ovarian cancer.
Are the money hungry plaintiffs and ambulance chasing lawyers prepared to pay JNJ's legal defense bills once this gets overturned on appeal?
Jnj just forms a nice cup and handle. See 170 in oct!
A good time to buy/add JNJ shares. Good luck y'all.
Nice to see 130 again. Cant keep old JNJ down too long.
"JNJ 's one dose 72 %, Pfizer and Moderna 52% effective. JNJ is still awaiting results of its 2 dose study. It may be 98 to 100% effective."
Sell now when it's still over 160. This will go into the low 150s next week. Analyst downgrades are coming. Don't say you weren't warned!
Almost pointless to try and post a positive outlook on a board full of shorts. It's all over Yahoo and most forums recently.
Awwww cash is crying alone hahaha
Going to $50
i just laugh at these stock traders looking for yield and buying absolute trash stocks/companies and wondering why their dividend got cut or the stock lost half its value. love jnj.
i really love this company but i had to get rid of a few shares of jnj for NOC. JNJ cant get over this 145 hump and NOC is on a tear and easily going to 400.
no major money flow changes just what it is today on a down day....Dr Scott Gottlieb also very positive on the J&J vaccine...just stay loose kids....just a day in the world of COVID. Boolean

Imo the FDA in Johnston Johnson relationship should be looked at strongly.
Baby powder lawsuits over cancer due to asbestos in talc is a drag on JNJ. $750M for four people awarded on Thursday February 6 not good.

It shoulda went up. This stock is not worth it anymore. Jnj was a safe haven during crashes. Not anymore
I think it is heading down to $137 to get some strength.

"After dividend ex date, there is nothing in JNJ to be excited. After all, Zytiga went generic and insiders sold."
Such deceit and underhanded garabage. Only 66% effective against getting the disease!!! So they now try to bill it as 95% effective against severity of disease after you get the disease from their low 66% efficacy against the disease! Wow! I don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about this one. Of course you have Fauci running things so anything is possible. Why is he still working ? He’s 80 years old for god’s sake! Doesn’t he have any hobbies? Grandchildren to play with? Oops I forgot. He’s still working because he is the highest paid government official to the tune of $417k a year. He’s content feeding off the government test!
Anyone see the Fridays JNJ-3989 presentation by Locarnini discussing it's amazing KD results around HBV? The significant JNJ investment in the ARWR partnership looks like it's going to pay off.
Just think about this. JandJ ceos according to their own memos knew about the asbestos..Knowing their product would be used especially on baby’s.. just to make afew extra bucks they turned a blind eye while their product sold to be used on children and baby’s.
"Finally getting some movement here - JNJ worth 130+ based on results and future forecast, pipeline of drugs etc.. However we have seen this before and gains are given up by the end of the week. We'll see if JNJ can sustain 128+ or 130+ by Friday close is the test"
this stock is getting hammered today
The litigation reminds me of the string of recalls a few years ago. That was a great opportunity to buy a high quality company at a discount. JNJ was trading for $60. The valuation was around 14x earnings which is about where JNJ is trading now.

"We are about to get close to the 2018 level of low $120; at this price point, JNJ is at bargain prices and it will be foolish not to add. Some people are about to panic sale and anyone smart will reap the benefits. I have not said at any point that JNJ is not a great company, what I have said is that it was going to hit this prices and this is when jumping in makes sense. by the end of the day I will add to my position substantially. why because in two months the likelihood that JNJ is going to be 135 are way more likely than the chance that it will be under 100.Happy trading and good luck to everyone."
"One of the worst companies ever! They should be put out of business, FOREVER"

JNJ is much better than AKER. AKER is very small player for COvid 19
So far no reported allergic reactions reported on one shot vaccine for Johnson & Johnson. Looking again to see if efficacy of the drug vaccine is equal to that of the competitors. It's my sense that the vaccine appears to be stronger than the competitors. Well wait and see but this vaccine looks like it could help to end the pandemic sooner if the one shot works as well as we think.

Bought in today. Asbestos claim/case sell off is way over done.
The fact that J&J held mild cases out of the efficiency result makes me think that it was around 50% efficiency overall. Not sure the FDA will approve it. Why did the US government ordered extra Pfizer recently ?
Buy or add JNJ and MCD shares here. Collect decent dividends and bet on these two American gems.
Johnson & Johnson (aka Janssen) vaccine - 66% effective at preventing moderate disease - 85% effective at preventing severe disease - 100% effective at preventing hospitalisation and death- less effective against South Africa-originating variant- single shot- fridge temp

I do sympathize with any retail investor...here taking a loss as the asbestos it is not your fault. It might be a good time to move your investment somewhere else as J&J seems to think they are above the law when it comes to making profits from Baby products."
When time does the litigation against JNJ start today?

If you're lucky enough to have money, start spending it. Just like with JNJ, nations glory days come to an end as well. When this nation craters sometime in the next couple years, it's going to be very painful for those who haven't prepared, & spectacular to watch for those who have."
JNJ may have the solution to this virus.
Another Gorsky day! No matter what this stock can not break $ 150.00 per share.
LOVE MY DZSI and JNJ
Everyone in the United States of America could have a law suit imo stay tuned.
Stable and progressing stock with good dividend. What else do we want? JNJ may be volatile as the market is but it does not drop 10% all the sudden like other stocks. It will go up gradually and steady.
"Not good news for the market as a whole, that said it'll be a great buying opportunity"
And so it begins.........
JNJ performance for the year 2018 is very disappointing. Needs to change some of those top management.

"Such an unethical company. Do a google search for ""asbestos in baby powder"", scroll down to the google suggestion of what people search for. Click the tab with the question: ""Does J&J baby powder contain asbestos?"". According to Johnson & Johnson's webpage (which they now removed the following content): ""Fact #1: Since the 1970s, talc used in consumer products has been required to be asbestos-free, so JOHNSON'S talc products do not contain asbestos, a substance classified as cancer-causing."" The only way to look at this statement is via cache or through the method I described above since google search engine takes time to update content in their listing.UNETHICAL, and I grew up using J&J baby powder. Anyone exposed (baby, caregiver, parents) might be at health risk!"
Would someone please help me understand how this stock reaches a high of 140.70 and now is rading at 138.19? Is the company itself taking money off the top or are major funds selling off the highs?
"Re today's Xarelto settlement:“Even in the face of meritless allegations, and even while winning in court, complex litigation demands an enormous amount of time and resources,” the pharmaceutical division of Johnson & Johnson explained in a statement regarding the settlement.“Because of this litigation, our talented scientists and researchers, our employees and many doctors across the country have had to spend numerous hours answering questions from plaintiff lawyers, compiling documents those lawyers have asked for, and otherwise being pulled away from their passion for patient care. As a healthcare company, we want to spend every moment we can improving lives and finding new cures.”"

"One of the reasons for the high rate in New Orleans, is obesity, so the experts have said.When we work through this, Dr. Birx should be looking at the prescribed drugs of those who have died, since many drugs, particularly elective ones, weaken the immune system. The US is a leader in consuming these drugs, and its probably why the US has such a large percent of people showing symptoms, and people dying.Minimally, until further is known, they should call for the end of TV ads until the crisis has passed."

JNJ has a number of links regarding information on Talc. You would be surprised how many current products you use everyday that contain Talc. It is one of the softest products in the world and for that reason it has been used in many products. Don't you think the FDA would have taken JNJ Baby Powder of the shelves in thousands of retail outlets by now if they felt the product was truly harmful. Back a few years ago you couldn't find JNJ Tylenol products anywhere due to concern about their manufacuting processes in a number of JNJ factories. JNJ had to shut down several factories and revamp the entire manufacturing process. This tooks months. The FDA was all over JNJ during that time. If the talc used in their baby powder was so harmful the FDA would have done something by now. There have never been any requirements to put warning labels on these products. JNJ has concrete evidence and science saying that the talc they use is not harmful. Baby powder contributes about .5% of JNJ's $70B + revenue. I don't think JNJ would continue the product if they thought it would harmful to babies and the general population. It's just not worth the risk. At the end of the day this is a classic example of the press stating something to harm the reputation of a great company. JNJ will do whatever it takes to defend itself and it's reputation. GL to all the longs. This too shall pass.
This will go down as much it went up today and lots more by close on Friday ....

WOW 52 week high. I regret not adding more at $109 just a short time ago
Could someone explain what happened in the last hours Friday with the 1 point drop ?

"Update on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Programs Targeting TDP-43 $JNJ, $RHHBY, $AVXLLausanne, Switzerland, November 1, 2018 - AC Immune SA (ACIU), a Swiss-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases will provide updates on its product candidates at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting 2018, taking place in San Diego from November 3rd to 7th, 2018.The first update will cover the wholly-owned TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) antibody program aimed to provide novel therapeutic options for patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). The second update will be on the accompanying diagnostic program focused to deliver positron emission tomography (PET) tracers specific for misfolded and aggregated TDP-43, which is non-exclusively partnered with Biogen Inc.The oral presentation entitled ""Discovery and development of diagnostics and therapeutics for TDP-43 proteinopathies"" includes data on both programs and will be presented on November 4th during the session ""Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies"" (1pm to 3.15 pm, PST; Session #188, in room SDCC 5).AC Immune is developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against pathological forms of the transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Misfolded TDP-43 has been identified as the major component of pathological protein inclusions, in both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). It has been shown that pathological TDP-43 can spread from neuron to neuron as being described for many pathological proteins in neurodegenerative disease. This mechanism creates the opportunity to interfere with the process through application of monoclonal antibodies. AC Immune is using its proprietary SupraAntigenTM technology to raise a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded TDP-43 which are currently undergoing functional evaluation. This program is wholly-owned by AC Immune.Complementary to a therapeutic approach, AC Immune is developing novel PET tracers specifically targeting pathological TDP-43 inclusions. Small molecules suitable for PET tracer development are being derived from AC Immune's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform, which is designed to interact with misfolded and aggregated proteins. Promising small molecule hits have been identified by binding assays using patient -derived TDP-43 aggregates. The ability to precisely diagnose FTLD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies and therefore treat patients earlier and more accurately is critical to disease management that uses novel therapeutic approaches. This collaboration with Biogen Inc. was established in April 2016; it is non-exclusive, and AC Immune retains intellectual property and commercialization rights.About TDP-43TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein 43) is a new target in the area of neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolded, aggregated TDP-43 is found in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Huntington's disease. There is growing body of evidence that the pathological aggregation of TDP-43 protein also plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. The link of clinical features and spread of pathological TDP-43 is associated with a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and make misfolded TDP-43 a promising target for our antibody program.About TDP-43-PET tracers A brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain involving an imaging device and an imaging agent called a PET tracer. No TDP-43-PET tracer has received regulatory approval for commercial distribution, which represents an important medical need to diagnose precisely patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Once the TDP43-PET tracer is introduced to the body, it transiently enters the brain and binds to abnormal TDP-43 inclusions. Through the radiotracer on the tracer molecule, the imaging device detects the TDP-43 imaging agent and creates pictures reflecting the amount and distribution of misfolded TDP-43 in the brain.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immune-present-2018-society-100115734.html?guccounter=1"
"Not sure what else J&J needs to do - great Q1 and Q2 results, double digit growth, strong pipeline, future forecast. Lawsuits are a drag but in the end J&J has them managed as science is on their side. Price should be well above $130 and should not have declined so much this year."
"If you post a bullish message here, you'll immediately be rewarded with four thumbs down. Bearish messages receive four thumbs up. Quite the staff they have here. However, the stock is holding strong during this afternoon's volatility, and should rightfully be going higher. Wouldn't be surprised to see at least 160 this week. Now, serve up the four thumbs down..."
