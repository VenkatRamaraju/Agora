Open P3 enrollment would prohibit $JNJ from listing #Imetelstat for expanded access. #FDA approval would do the same.
"Very satisfying ruling. If market doesn't tank, +$10 over the next couple of weeks. Cover shorts, the sooner the better. Great company, great products, smart people."
Is it a good price to buy ? please .
Maybe we don not need a vaccin. See the results from Relief: https://relieftherapeutics.com/neurorx-and-relief-announce-topline-efficacy-data-from-patients-treated-with-rlf-100-aviptadil-under-the-u-s-fda-expanded-access-protocol-authorization-for-respiratory-failure-related-to/
"Mark your calendars! on 7/21 $MRNA, $PFE, $MRK, $JNJ and $AZN will be testifying before congress on the status of their vaccine, manufacturing and distribution plans. This will undoubtedly give Nvax a boost if the landscape is as we all think it is and NVAX is the real deal."
Looks like someone else is having the same idea as I am to buy protection at this point by selling call options.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/large-option-traders-arent-buying-191911267.html
Today was a good buying opportunity. Unfortunately I spent my wad adding here last week. I’m not gonna lose any sleep over it because last week was a good time to add considering the long term.
I bet JNJ goes to $130 by next week.

Another buying opportunity.......jmho
It was the first name trump said
Just bought 18 shares. Jeej #$%$15 of dividend this week. Let's see where it goes halfway 2021.
JNJ reached an all time high at 152.73
"I don't get it yesterday it's thisDon't Be Surprised When Johnson & Johnson Acquires Geron Within A Year https://seekingalpha.com/article/4165649?source=ansh $GERN, $ABBV, $JNJ, $PCYC"
Johnson Company is mammoth.
Reuter’s has stated they stand behind their report because it came straight from Jnj documents
JNJ better give a special dividend to shareholders when the lawsuits are settled. They did this to us knowing full well. All leadership should also be removed. Totally unnecessary to get into Opioids.
"For those wishing JNJ would make an acquisition:""J&J moves to buy Japanese cosmetic products company""""Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday that buying Ci:z gives it a stronger position by ""leveraging one of the largest customer relationship management databases for direct-to-consumer skincare in Japan."" It also gives the company more distribution and expansion opportunities.""""Distribution and expansion opportunities"" sounds good to me."
"Truly outstanding quarterly earnings results demonstrating that JNJ is so much more than just the covid vaccine - no reason at all to be down pre-market, should be $165+ today"

JNJ’s board should either fire Gorsky or reduce salary because of his inability to create share holder value
"Another day and another miserable performance by JNJ while most stocks in the sector were green.As many people noticed here, JNJ has a serious problem and that is the way its management is running the company.JNJ management is chocking the company with their conservative and backward methods. Investors don't expect JNJ grow like AMZN or AAPL but the company should do what it knows to do instead of pretending to be expert in every sector.Here is an obvious example, JNJ is very poor in electronic and software (zero understanding) and when it buys any medical device then it let to become obsolete. Software and electronic are changing almost every 6 months and they are not like drug development that takes several years. Looking at software/hardware as a drug is killing the company. ABT used to have ABBV, but it realized that medical equipment is totally different from pharma sector.They broke up the company into ABT and ABBV and both have performed excellent since then. Backward JNJ management has not realized this fact yet and that is the reason for JNJ poor performance."
This vaccine prevents you from dying!!!That’s what people are afraid off!! Keeps you out of the Hospital too!! 1 shot and can be stored for months. Seems like a great deal to me!! Sign me up!!
Anyone see the Fridays JNJ-3989 presentation by Locarnini discussing it's amazing KD results around HBV? The significant JNJ investment in the ARWR partnership looks like it's going to pay off.
U.S. appeals court declines J&J bid to stop generic Zytiga sales. I knew it had to be more than just a sector rotation thing. Way too much of a drop for just that.
They seem to halt everything these days...that won't even move the stock
I don’t know what Bob89 is talking about. He couldn’t manage a link. Here’s one article of interest though: https://www.thestreet.com/markets/johnson-johnson-jury-rules-in-its-favor-in-cancer-case-15043862
If Kavenaugh is confirmed the lawsuits will disappear. The Supreme Court will rule in J&J's favor.His rulings tend to favor big business plus no proof talc causes cancer.
"Soon above $140. Fair or not, this is how market reacts."
BUYER continue to come in....................... steady........................
Nice pop from JNJ Covid-19 vaccine!
Big news coming...stay tuned
Class action law suit against Lab by shareholders is in order!
Divy yield payout ratio is too high. Sell
. Why play around with this When JCP. is going to double. This can't and SEC filings show JCP has huge institutional & insider buying and support. NO BRAINER MIN 40%
Very nice recovery with the market. Earnings beat will propel this back to 140's. Stay long and strong.
"Let's see who buys. $JNJ, $AMGN, $PFE, Excitting times for Pharma consolidation. Mega"
"All of those that gave a thumbs-down over the weekend, when I said JNJ would drop when the news came out. DOWN 2.53% in the first hour. 150 or below is IMMINENT."
"Was expecting it to fall as a brick, nah not in this market I guess"
It's fantastic that this is already going up without an earnings report or a resumption of vaccinations. Here's hoping it continues.
The $4.5 billion award was an insane amount of money for 22 plaintiffs. That better be reversed or cut by 95% if there is justice. I think this whole thing is ridiculous. Why would JNJ intentionally harm people. I don't believe talc is a dangerous product. I don't think a trace amount of asbestos could cause cancer and nobody can prove it was the cause of their cancer.
Small compared to the billions. Jnj will appeal. A nothing story
"Who cares about the stock! If this is true, I would not touch any j&j product. I will follow closely."

Is it true that JNJ is considering acquiring CYDY before GILD does? Serious replies only.

"Seems that hayflick and Walter white have identical opinions, post 3 or 4 full paragraphs when nobody is really listening ri them, and they've posted incessantly since JnJ walked away from their GERN deal, obliterating GERN from 7 bucks to a dollar. Identical stories from the same, angry troll, whining and crying daily, ANYTHING to avoid taking any blame for his own foolishness of over investing in garbage. So now, JNJ is the scapegoat to his stupidity as he creates more screennames."

"Impact from lower taxes, weaker dollar, Accretive effect of acquisition all should help upcoming earnings. Along with the upcoming expectations of healthy dividend increase, stock should start moving again. I wouldn't be surprised to see upper 140's by end of April, Long and strong."
The court award is small potatoes in the big scheme of things for a $400B capitalized company. JNJ legal teams are doing a fine job to avoid and mitigate the risks.
Is now a good time to enter?
"And ... Ex-Dividend Date Feb 22, 2021 coming soon"
"JNJ got a shout out from (at least) one of the Democratic candidates last night.This was the first debate I have watched. Regardless of party, lots of ideas/promises, but...."
"So 5 yrs ago it was 108 and today 130. That's pretty poor return, dividend is not that great, needs to be higher if it's gonna have that kind of performance."
This adds to Gorsky’s anti Georgia voting law. But still can’t get into any JnJ facility without and ID. LeBron James to be added to the BoD soon.
Some one said they were holding JNJ from 1980's ...back in 80's and 90's interest rates on CD's were so high. I remember in 1998 it was 6.5%.. How does it make sense to invest in companies like JNJ where the dividend was never more than 3%? Just trying to understand. thats all.
Is this pretty much a dividend stock ? Not much room to go up anymore ?
"this is just my opinion, whenever the company is about to report earnings... the stock goes up... if earnings are good then stock goes down after..and in bad earnings the stock goes up. I don't understand the logic but I noticed it with WMT, AAPL, CVS.. Again, this is just my opinion..might not be true always but noticed it in the last couple of months."
Don't buy any jnj products
"Interesting! JNJ tends to go up after ex-dividend a lot of times I have noticed, obviously contrary to common wisdom."
"From ESG standpoint, value, and history of steady growth, I opened my position right before the correction."
Wow $JNJ is on sale today! Wish I could've nibbled some today.
Hi I am new here. Any reason why J&J are quiet on the news front? No commercial/acquisitions etc?
Not what was expecting when market opened 
This should easily be in the 130s. Back to pre-covid levels
"Longs - Keep your eyes out for J&J to release their non-human primate and trials data after hours today or over the weekend. Should have a field day with this when it comes out. ""When exposed to the virus, six out of six animals who got the vaccine candidate were completely protected from lung disease and five out of six were protected from infection as measured by the presence of virus in nasal swabs, according to the study published in the journal Nature."" $JNJ"
When people overreact that is the best time to buy. I added a little to my life long position before the end of the close.
"Wow, we finished green today"
Department of Justice is going to look into the relationship between Johnson and Johnson and the FDA also is how do they get approved for your drug so quickly when all these little other companies take years and years
Very clear and robust response to recent talc articles from J&J CEO Alex Gorsky - watch video message from link below.https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6480491001680003072
You would have to be living under a huge rock to not know that the vaccine would be approved for use. Now the big question is! How much of the stock price has already been baked in by Wall Street? Is this really a catalyst to make the stock move up. Almost every one on this board has been expecting a bump to North to take place. I would like that to happen. However I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t. Best to all

CRAMER .... JNJ is way UNDER VALUED !
One would think a large corporation would carry risk insurance for just such a circumstance
"Reuter's tried to portray that there is some smoking gun but there is really nothing new. JNJ defends the science and the scientific bias is weighted in favor of uncertainty about talc at best. To say JNJ knew use would ""cause cancer"" is simply not factual because outside research to date doesn't offer clarity. The problem too is that as with any product it can be applied in various ways and in some ways which were not intended or not anticipated by JNJ. While I'm certain the American Cancer Society position on talc has been posted here before it is worth reposting the link. The notion that talc could contain nominal asbestos particulate is nothing new what remains is whether it can or does cause cancers and at consumer exposure levels. The question is has no clear answer. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/talcum-powder-and-cancer.html"
Is it time to replace Gorsky. Every big Pharma is up for the year!
3 Insider Buys on JNJ on 12/14. All by directors. I just saw the news
"Read that $JNJ has had yet another vaccine site with adverse reactions. You need a multi prong approach. Some especially vulnerable should get the mRNA and a traditional vaccine approach like a Covaxin. This is the right approach. If we're getting back to any normalcy, we need more options!"
"Now is not the time to own JNJ. It's heading back to the lows of the day.The verdict removed uncertainty, but it still reflects a likely $15+ billion settlement, and tons of litigation in the process. Plus, wrongful death suits.The rise today is a shorting opportunity."

What caused over a $2 drop in less than 15 minutes? Somebody with a lot of stock wanted out quickly for some reason. Not the smartest execution in a huge up market.

Today is the overreaction of all overreactions. Money managers that had short positions are simply piling on. They will be buying by the EOD.
"Shorts scared. CRON with $1,576,000,000,000 in cash they could buy many companies and merge with $TLRY. V shape Recovery. The market will go back to new highs. $JNJ has a vaccine using it on an emergency basis. $ABT has 5-minute testing. That story will be destroyed and on to the next."
"We got JPM, GS and JNJ tomorrow before open! Should be an interesting morning!"
"JnJ is taking longer on the vaccine, not because it is waiting on results, but because they are already working on distribution logistics. Everyone should be buying the options on this stock and the underlying stock to make sure we hit the all time high."
JNJ...what a beautiful stock at $143
The fact that J&J held mild cases out of the efficiency result makes me think that it was around 50% efficiency overall. Not sure the FDA will approve it. Why did the US government ordered extra Pfizer recently ?

"am not a speculator/gambler, I am an investor. I bought JNJ because of the dividend it pays and every quarter makes me happy.Every year the dividend is increased. I will be happy in March when my next dividend check comes in and even happier in June when my dividend payment is increased, hopefully to $1/share."

I think I’ve identified my best contrarian indicator. Whenever david/jhon/ashley/salmon are here trolling I should immediately put in a JNJ market order.
"$OCGN Why would anyone take the $JNJ vaccine once this is approved? Also works better than $PFE & $MRNA when it comes to the UK variant and other mutations! Covaxin is the best vaccine in the world right now! BUY, HOLD and upvote this post if you're holding LONG & STRONG!"
$ISRG the writing is on the wall. It’s time to sell and buy back at $400 after covid and the market has been sliced up by the competition. Best to place your gains into $JNJ $TRXC.
"JNJ lost its ""trustworth"" reputation. Portfolio managers may not treat this company as a core holding. Go with MRK, BMY, PFE."

"i bought today....12 million shares.....something is going on....investors realizing this is steal...buy, buy buy buy buy!"
You buy 5 billion of stock and its only up 2 dollars imo big troubles ahead.
Seems to reason the JNJ vaccine batch causing problems was contaminated with AZN's bad boy. Never did hear it announced how far back the contamination issue existed.
With or without the vaccine jnj is still a great company
Got to love the media. How can we put them all on the Titanic and send in out to sea again?

I like JNJ they are solid their products are everywhere. They are gonna be hard to shake of even if economy plays funny games....
Good at making opioids and talc but vaccine.
i really love this company but i had to get rid of a few shares of jnj for NOC. JNJ cant get over this 145 hump and NOC is on a tear and easily going to 400.
There will short squeeze come the end of the day
"Why people will use JNJ vaccine while other have much higher efficiency? Modena, Pfizer and Novavax all have around 95%."
Tomorrow the market will be down 300 and we will be up .25 lol 
Gee how did J&J ever become a 450 billion dollar company without a covid vaccine?
I don't get it........Daratumumab (Darzalex) got approved again by the FDA for the fifth time .......... ?? Does that mean they can now use it from the start of the treatment of MM ?

J&J’s response. Check it out! http://www.factsabouttalc.com/
We are in the early stage of a new bull run. Wouldn't be surprised to see us knocking on the doors of 170-180 area in a few months. 170 is still only 20 times forward earnings. JnJ pe has gone in the past to 23 during bull runs and the dividend yields had gone to 2% at those times.
Seriously disappointed in JNJ... company has been around forever and cannot even produce an effective vaccine..

"April 26 will be the shareholders meeting at 10 am. We will know the dividend increase that Thursday next week. Just maybe they will surprise us with a larger increase since they said sales will be better next year and the repatriation of the return of big bucks to the USA.

Maybe I'm fooling myself, but do think it's in the cards to get this behemoth stock heading back towards $150."

JnJ doesnt like leachers. They will unpause the trails this week when they find out the patient was placebo. Let me get them cheap shares lose hands!!
I have been a long time stock-holder of JnJ but I had to sell my shares and I'm not comfortable with the present situation.Countless law suits are pending and will probably grow if they lose these cases.Their P/E is already high enough.IT has been a great company and a quality company but these lawyers know hos to twist things to benefit their self and I don't like saying that.
165 before end of the week !!!!
Clrb has lots of positive news!
Good buy below 120. Better buy below 115. Just bought some at 119. Solid stock. Hope it goes down more so that I could buy more. Ignore all the noise and accumulate.
Still $100 overvalued per share using discounted cash flow analysis.

Interesting to see that JNJ is down today with the great results that just came out. Novavax on the other end is up 48% !!! The efficacy results in South Africa are basically the same as the JNJ. Both good results for these 2 vaccines one being one shot and soon available worldwide. Nova ax will be coming much later.

"Science and the Appeal Courts are with JNJ---The tests are much better and more senitive now than they were in the 1970's.

They are """"small undetectable amounts"" of everything in everything."

Very strong results - beating street estimates and yet due to unfounded litigation the price goes down! Crazy

"INSIGHT- Inside J&J's Latam COVID vaccine trial, a rush to recruit is followed by disappointment""At first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you 'that's it,'"" he said. ""You understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.""Peru, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia had all offered to participate in the trial, hoping that would give them preferential access to J&J's vaccine in the global race to stockpile doses. J&J told Reuters in September that those hosting trials would have priority for vaccine supply.Now some in government circles and the public health community fear those deals could be compromised. And local researchers have been left wondering whether they will be fully compensated for their investment in incomplete trials.J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers."

Another buying opportunity thanks to the conference call.
Just bought 200 more shares at $130.85. Will buy another 200 if it drops below 130. I have seen JNJ go up and down over the last 25 years. If you're a long term investor and you don't see this as a buying opportunity then you are not an investor you're just trying to make a fast buck like most retail investors. JNJ is not and never will be a day trade stock. GL to all longs. It's a tuff day but if you weren't planning on selling your shares today try to hang in. Tomorrow is a new day.
$135 is a reasonable price.
"By my calculation the FDA 14-2 Panel Approval gives JNJ a 98% chance of winning On March 4th.Those are the best odds in years.This drug is not well publicized, but by the time it hits 20/20, dateline or is all over CNN,CNBC,abc, cbs , pbsand worldwide news many will be chasing it much higher.Approval of Esketamine has opened a pandora's box of upside revenue JNJ has never seen for a drug.Simply do the math."

"FDA approves Amgen's biosimilar to J&J's rheumatoid arthritis drugDec 6: R**euters - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Amgen Inc's biosimilar copy of Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, according to the regulator's website.The biosimilar, Avsola, has the same chemical components, dosage form and strength as Remicade and would treat a range of autoimmune disorders.Amgen did not give the pricing of the drug immediately, but said is confident to compete in the biosimilar market.With the regulatory approval, Avsola joins the existing biosimilars to J&J's drug, including Pfizer Inc's 2017 approved Ixifi, Celltrion Inc's Inflectra and Merck & Co and Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd's Renflexis.Avsola will add to Amgen's growing biosimilar unit, which could be $2 billion over the next several years, says Jefferies analyst Michael Yee.However, Yee doesn't see the drug as a major driver of sales for Amgen right now.Avsola was approved for all eligible indications of Remicade, including the treatment of bowel disease, Crohn's disease and skin disorder plaque psoriasis, the agency said.Biosimilars are medicines considered highly similar to an original drug and are cheaper alternatives to biologic products.The blockbuster drug Remicade, approved in the United States, European Union and other regions, has steadily lost market share among patients enrolled in the Canadian province of Quebec's public drug program and elsewhere, where biosimilars have been slowly catching on with doctors and patients."

"WHAT does this mean 64,000 deaths( A YEAR) from drug overdose in THE U.S. cost U.S. taxpayers 115 billion in 2017 how much money does JNJ HAVEBy Katie Benner and Jan HoffmanFeb. 27, 2018WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is throwing its weight behind plaintiffs in a sprawling, high-stakes prescription opioids lawsuit in Ohio, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday.Mr. Sessions said that the Justice Department plans to file a so-called statement of interest in the lawsuit, a technique that past administrations have typically reserved for cases that directly affect the federal government’s interests, like diplomacy and national security.The Obama administration had used statements of interest to expand the boundaries of civil rights laws.At a news conference, Mr. Sessions said the lawsuit targeted “opioid manufacturers and distributors for allegedly using false, deceptive and unfair marketing of opioid drugs.”"
JNJ took off in the wrong direction 
"I purchased my first 100 shares of JNJ at $48.25 on July 25, 2002, another 100 on November 19, 2009, another 100 on June 1, 2010, & my last lot of 100 shares about a month later. In between those, I purchased smaller lots of 25 or 50 shares when I had the money available, & I thought it was under valued. I also reinvested the dividends. On March 11, 2014, I did my last dividend reinvestment. I didn't stop because I no longer liked J&J as an investment, I stopped because it had grown to almost 20.00% of my brokerage account. 602.441 shares x $93.23 = $ $56,165.00Today, those 602 shares are worth $84,769.47 & for just over 5 years now, I've been getting a nice fat check from J&J every 3 months.The last one was Tuesday $572.32This, combined with the other dividends I receive from REIT’s, stocks, municipal bonds, etc, plus a private sector pension, allowed me to retire early.You can't put a price on that. I don't for one second, believe in any of the lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson, especially those pending relating to opioids.The parasite lawyers & states are just looking for a big payday. It's probably too late, but hopefully someday, America can go back to being a country where something called personal responsibility exists.Don't give an inch JNJ, these drugs were, & still are perfectly legal.

"I don't know why there are so many people with negative views on this stock. Sure it is not gaining this much lately, but overvalued? P/E ratio of 23 and forwarding 16 is UNDERVALUED in healthcare! It would be bouncing around 147 and 155 for awhile. It is impossible to go down to 120. In fact, it would have a higher possibility of going towards 160."
"JNJ is being overshadowed by NVAX. It's true JNJ's vaccine is not as effective. However, it only takes one dose to reach efficacy. The news is brand new and the media is only comparing JNJ's vaccine to NVAX's right now, rather than talking about the benefits of one dose. Also, JNJ has no sales agreements signed yet.I think once people start realizing the benefits and potential here, the stock will go up. This has always been a long-hold stock and it will continue that trend."

Just pulled the trigger on 200 at $128.85. This PR mess is going to settle down. The overall market is not helping. At the end of the day JNJ's fundamentals have not changed. If you can't take advantage of a 15% discount you're missing a true buying opportunity. Still above the $123 level just 6 months ago. Check your past dividend payouts.

The one shot vaccine that can get the world back on track
"This is correct, ""In its statement Friday, Johnson & Johnson said ""thousands of independent tests by regulators and the world's leading labs prove our baby powder has never contained asbestos."" The Reuters report is pure nonsense."
"When JNJ cut people without a notice""At first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you 'that's it,'"" he said. ""You understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.""J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers.Total irresponsible."
My wife got the JNJ vaccine with absolutely no side effects. I’ll wait for the JNJ vaccine to come back before I have to get mine.
Increased their dividends for the last forty years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How do you go wrong???????????
"JnJ vaccine using same Adenovirus vector technology as AstraZeneca which has halted its trial in US due to a severe reaction. The adenovirus is used as a vector to inject live human cells with DNA that then produces Covid 19 proteins for the life of the cell. The question is when will the genetically modified cell turn off. churning out Covid 19 proteins could induce a severe inflammatory response AKA: AstraZeneca causing myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord membrane).Whatever happened to using the tried, proven, and safe method of combining viral proteins with adjuvants to train the immune system to fight off a real infection."
If JNJ completely pull their vaccine off the market in the US. That would not effect their revenue steam in the US. They are selling to our government at cost. All profits from the vaccine would come from out side the US. Correct me if I’m wrong.

In after-hours trading Wednesday, EBS stock tumbled. Volume 0% The Baltimore plant run by Emergent Biosolutions is reportedly working on vaccines from both Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca (AZN). According to the New York Times, workers conflated ingredients of the two vaccines, ruining 15 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson jab.Johnson & Johnson will have to hold off shipping its vaccine while the Food and Drug Administration investigates, according to the report. In a written statement, Johnson & Johnson said quality control identified one batch of drug substance at the Emergent Biosolutions plant that didn't meet standards.""This batch was never advanced to the filling and finishing stages of our manufacturing process,"" J&J said. ""This is an example of the rigorous quality control applied to each batch of drug substance. The issue was identified and addressed with Emergent and shared with the United States Food and Drug Administration.""~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Looks like another buying opportunity thanks to the mix up by workers at a plant contracted to make two different vaccines.

Remember Tylenol scandal...JNJ will survive and thrive again. Great buying opportunity here.

So far no reported allergic reactions reported on one shot vaccine for Johnson & Johnson. Looking again to see if efficacy of the drug vaccine is equal to that of the competitors. It's my sense that the vaccine appears to be stronger than the competitors. Well wait and see but this vaccine looks like it could help to end the pandemic sooner if the one shot works as well as we think.
coverage initiated and earnings beat forcast so why the big drop today! I don't know.. but am holding.
DRIP purchase on 1/3/2019 @ $125.84. Closing price on 1/4/2019 @ $127.83. JNJ is way underpriced but I'll take the gift of undervalued shares any day and watch JNJ rise back to where the pps belongs.

An important note that is suspected with this vaccine.. they suspect that at 4-6 months it will be closer to 90-95% of the other vaccines... This study really only had the capability to look at the 2-4 month benefit.I didn't own JNJ until this morning... I believe the news is a lot better than what the top line % implies.

For perspective, and from a PFE article published today via Bloomberg:""While drugmakers have garnered attention over the past year for racing to develop innovative vaccines and treatments for Covid-19, demand for other forms of care has slowed.

Still unable to open and hold $150 which is very surprising to me. I do. It understand why people are selling here. I bought shares at $137 and $139 and added earlier this week at $144. I am puzzled by the poor performance.
I don't believe Talcum Powder causes cancer. I believe the talcum powder is safe. Impossible to prove that this talcum powder with a trace amount of asbestos caused the cancer in any particular case - imho.

"49 States to go, with more than 2000 pending lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies."
Insiders know something which is the reason this has been tanking since last week. Is it perhaps the lawsuits or maybe the vaccine is not working? Small time investors are always at a loss because we do not have the inside track like the big brokerages and banks.
"J&J has taken legal knocks in the last year, I figured it was over after it recovered from the spate of publicity about talcum powder. When last I looked it was down $7.07 on a down 350 DOW pts day. That's a pretty big hit. Seems overdone."

"'JNJ, PLAN to develop...'. I hope they actually work to develop a vaccine and not say PLAN just to pump their stock. Seems a lot of biotechs are riding the corona virus scare and pumping their stocks."
If you believe that the Earth is flat and that we never landed on the Moon while being able to land eight or so probes on Mars then the Reuters fictional story is just perfect for you.
"It's a sensible time to buy or add JNJ shares here. I am an old fart and have owned JNJ for a long long time. It's diversified company, producing cradle to grave products, a solid buy and hold. Buy the dips and enjoy the dividend stream."
"Early this year when JNJ went above $148, it dropped to $118 in a few weeks.Now the market is worse than early this year and JNJ will repeat itself.Exit all stocks and save yourself from bear market."

JNJ One-Shot vaccine now in use in South Africa for healthcare workers.
Will this stock ever split again ? Would love to buy some but at a lower price.
This is a great defensive stock and should go to $150 today.
JNJ is down -4.92% to 130.90
"July govt opened investigations into talc and J&J knowledge of asbestos, if this blows up, the number of security fraud cases will also explode. Ignoring that this is clearly a buy, but how can you ignore that? People are dying, and large cases have been won, this is just the tip of the iceberg."
Thank you JNJ.
"I am cracking up looking at this stock thinking about the long-runners on this board... You all keep saying this is the best for long-term position, but that only shows how antiquated you are. JNJ will not even see the dust of the biotech companies that work with DNA and other innovative treatments in the next 3-5 years."
Do you guys think it will beat the earnings?
JNJ needs to get and keep the share price around $140+/- so they can buy out GERN in the near future. JMHO mind you.
JNJ'S failures in Robotic simp aly widensnd deepens the moat around ISRG THANKS
"NY Yankees news. This vaccine just cant seem to catch a break. I understand these players were in close proximity and they shared some of their equipment as well. Plus there have been atleast 4000 breakthrough cases in America, mostly not related to JnJ. But since it is Yankees here plus the old bad news, it is just very bad optics. Move to BNTX or Nvax which is on huge sale now."
Good time to get in on the dip!

"thank you for this, im going to make jnj 25% of my portfolio"
I sold today at $139 - a healthy $20K profit for holding for 2 months plus the div on top. I don't think this is going much further for a while - we will see
Fox News had 3 full minutes in merits of JNJ Vaccine going into trials- one dose.
Just bought in today on the dip at $132.11 and I think it was a very good choice.
"@cosmicdust,Please explain to me why is it that every broke person feels that successful people need their investment advice?"
Anyone have a opinion on why we have fallen from $170 to $158 in the last month. Very little pop on Friday after hours. It?s looking kind of sickly. Please no smart #$%$ opinions. Thanks
When you mix safe stock with asbestos it suddenly becomes unsafe.I wonder why.
Buy for div today.
European Union is investigating the JnJ vaccine for blood clots. the American mainstream media has been so soft with $JnJ. so the federal government especially with the manufacturer Emergent

"""It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price "".One month ago jnj was a phenomenal company and it still is today, it's stock price is however at a price that makes it irresistible."
July 16th will be a good day for longs. JNJ will beat and guide up.
I would expect phase 3 trial results by end of week before earnings ...
Dr. Mathai Mammen global head R&D J&J said 28 days = 85% effective - South Africa results very effective - emergency use pending....soon
JNJ is a good pick to hold and see what happens
jnj will drip to $110.
What exactly does it take for this stock to respond? I backed the wrong horse I guess. Novavax goes up a million pct and JnJ has floundered for weeks......
JNJ chart looks alike AZN patterns. The same stall ward type.
"Elective surgery down big, means medical devices etc down.. this will test 120 again.. Good div, excellent balance sheet, developing a covid vaccine, but earnings will hurt."
"I believe JNJ trades at a discount to its future value. It's vaccine should not only clear the FDA but provide a major boost to the stock price. I think all the lawsuits the company has been bogged down in over the new years have held it back from going over $200. This company is not only too big to kill it has major staying power in good times and bad and an excellent and safe dividend. I believe $160 is not a fair price for this company, and while it is a slow grower it is well worth the wait for future capital returns."
JNJ Covid Booster shots soon to be available to the public !this will be a game changer !
If JNJ buys out Geron-I would be happy to accept some JNJ stock as part of any deal
"Can't say im surpised this is down today. Big boys dump, cause panic and shake out some people to sell. Big boys buy in at a lower price, you chase and they laugh their way to the bank with your money."
JNJ beats earnings and the stock goes down?
Looks like it will tank today
Check TRX.L 2 Ground breaking products same industry DD
Looks like JNJ’s safe haven allure is taking it back to the December high of 148.5. Hopefully this time we are going to break out past 150! GLTL!
"Its a shame that news reporters ask doctors about HCQ, and get the answer ""we need to test it."" Well South Korea and China have been using it for therapeutic benefits for corona, with great success..And 40 tests by Rigano indicate when used with Azithromycin, it is 100% effective within 6 days.So over a week ago, a State, and several places started testing it. 6 days is long past.WHY HAVE WE HEARD NOTHING FROM THESE TRIALS. Why don't the news hosts press the doctors, and ask them how the trials are going ?Oh, I forgot. The CDC and FDA are enablers of big Pharma. They are now costing American lives as they slow down a process that could be helping people now.If I'm on a ventilator, I am going to invoke ""RIGHT TO TRY."" And then if I survive, I am going to sue everyone who kept me from using it BEFORE I needed a ventilator."
JNJ TO SOAR AND SPLIT FUNDAMENTALS!!!
"FDA commissioned a third party lab to test Talc for asbestos in 2009 including JNJ Baby Powder. Guess what? The lab found ""NAD,"" or No Asbestos Detected."" And the lab found NAD in ALL samples of talc by any supplier."
"The JNJ opioid case is a lousy stand-in. JNJ made two kinds of opioid-based pain relievers. One was a patch. It’s nearly impossible to extract fentanyl from a patch. The other was a pill that, unlike other companies’ pills, couldn’t be crushed and snorted. You could just as easily make the case that, with these drugs, J&J was actually trying to address the opioid crisis. The two products together barely had 1 percent of the market."
JNJ will be used in 3W countries. Not US EU
"I find it comical! When they came out with results, and the stock tanked, did some investors think that jnj wouldn't file for use with the fda? Now that they file it goes back up? Seems pretty silly to me."
JNJ quietly working its way to a new 52 week high.

"So the JnJ vaccine is very nuanced, but it does appear to be a good one. Note that against the South African variant, its 57% efficacious vs The Novavax vaccine at 60% efficacy ...almost identical. Considering the so called experts are predicting the variant versions will be the dominant strains, you can throw out the 95% and 94% stats out for Pzizer and Moderna...it’s not known what their efficacy against the variants are, since their stats were based on the Wuhan strain which was predominant when they did their trials. So based on the variant strains, it appears JnJ is right with the pack."
jnj will not split they will raise the dividend to $1.00 before split
That was the most obvious buying opportunity I've seen in awhile. There was not a rational explanation for the drop post earnings.
See you later at ! Welcome to the Biden market 
I'm a brand new member to the JNJ club as of today. Hoping this is a good entry point.
Cramer says look for the dips as a BUY here.
"Opioid lawsuits are much worse than talc lawsuits for JNJ. For talc lawsuits, JNJ may argue regarding the science while opioid already is proven to be dangerous and fatal. JNJ should've put more restriction on its opioid drugs but it didn't. After all, other drug companies already settled and I don't why is insisting to go to court and lose it big time."
Next stop 150 when verdict is overturned.
Will we see $150 again this year?
"Cramer says JNJ stock is soaring. LOL. 1,86% is soaring? He’s a pumper must pay his bills"
JNJ share price will come back from recent dips - good dividend declaration today and earnings on 22nd will be strong as well. Litigation will keep being defended and scientific evidence and years of clear test results are on their side. I don't see evidence for this glorified conspiracy story so that won't amount to anything in court.
Clearly the news on in production delay is very troublesome and disappointing. We thought they had started production in risk 6 months ago. Lost 2 month in sales and future market share.
"Great earnings. Revenues and EPS beat. More importantly the guidance is raised. However down $2 because the covid 19 trials are paused because 1 individual from 60,000 had an unexplained adverse reaction. The kicker is that JNJ will not make money from covid vaccine. As a result the reaction this morning seems beyond stupid to me."
Down again. This stock can not break 140. Split it!

we'll come back strong!!
"The growing debt levels don't help. JNJ ended September with net debt of ~$14 billion. The company is unlikely to load up on more debt due to the talcum powder lawsuits. The key investor takeaway is that either the company doesn't see the stock as cheap now or the combination of net debt and talc powder lawsuits has JNJ on the sidelines. Either way, the stock remains far too expensive for the limited growth rates and the risk. Sell JNJ on any of these rallies towards $140.Johnson & Johnson: Paying A Premium For Liability Risk $JNJ https://seekingalpha.com/article/4212256"

"So, JNJ has not been performing well since mid Jan/2018 when it hit $148. But looking at JNJ history, this scenario has been repeated many times in the past. That means that JNJ reaches a new high ($148) and then loses 10% to 20% and then rebound and heads for another new high.I think, JNJ has corrected enough(stock price wise) for this round since it lost about 20% from its high in past 5.5 months. It may stays in this area for a few weeks or months but it will be much higher than $120 by the end of this year. There are many reasons to support my statement and some are already public info. Medical devices and consumer products are going thru many changes and JNJ is positioning itself to be a clear leader in the medical devices in addition changing most of its consumer products. In biotech area, JNJ is not sitting idle and it jumps on opportunities that benefit the company. To do all those above, the company needs financial muscles and JNJ has strong financials plus a huge cash flow."

"Excellent results from a phase 1/2a JNJ COVID-19.Johnson & Johnson Posts Interim Results from Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of its Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine CandidateInterim analysis from Phase 1/2a First-in-Human trial supports further clinical development of investigational vaccine candidate JNJ-78436735 (also known as Ad26.COV2.S)Interim analysis from the ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate (JNJ-78436735) was posted today on the pre-print server medRxiv.The data demonstrate that a single dose of JNJ-78436735 induced a strong neutralizing antibody response in nearly all participants aged 18 years and older and was generally well-tolerated. Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.The ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial is designed to study the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and as single and two-dose schedules. The interim analysis showed that a single dose induced a robust immune response and was generally well-tolerated. These data are consistent with preclinical studies, published in the scientific journal Nature, which showed that a single dose of the vaccine successfully prevented subsequent infection and provided complete protection in the lungs of nonhuman primates.Based on these findings, the single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate of 5x1010 virus particles (vp) has been selected for further evaluation in the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial. The Company also plans on running a Phase 3 clinical trial of a two-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 versus placebo later this year.The full set of results will be published once the complete Phase 1/2a trial data are available.Immune Response DataSeroconversion (the development of detectable antibodies) was observed in 99 percent of participants aged 18-55 years of age. 98 percent of participants were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 29 post-vaccination. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate elicited strong antibody responses, strong T cell responses, and a Th1 response, believed to be protective against the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.Immunogenicity (the ability to trigger an immune response) data from participants aged 65 years of age and above were available for the first 15 participants at the time of this post, with strong humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in all elderly participants who received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Immune responses were similar across the age groups studied, including older adults.Safety and Tolerability DataInterim safety data from the Phase 1/2a trial indicated that the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate (grade 1 and grade 2) in severity and generally occurred on the day of vaccination with symptoms generally resolving that day, or the following day. Two serious adverse events were reported, the first for hypotension which the investigator determined to not be vaccine related, and the second was a participant with a fever who was hospitalized due to suspicion of having COVID-19 but recovered within 12 hours. No grade 4 (life-threatening) adverse events, solicited or unsolicited, were reported in any cohort, and no participant discontinued the study due to an adverse event. The analysis showed there was a trend toward higher reactogenicity with the higher vaccine dose and with younger age.In clinical studies investigating vaccines, it is well known that vaccines often induce local and systemic side-effects that are mild, to moderate, and transient without consequences. In vaccine clinical trials these type of side effects are actively sought (""solicited""). The interim safety data in this Phase 1/2a study is blinded to ensure participants and trial investigators are not made aware which participants received a single dose of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate versus a placebo.Study DesignThis Phase 1/2a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate at two dose levels, administered intramuscularly as single-dose or two-dose schedules, eight weeks apart, in healthy adults 18-55 and greater than 65 years of age. The study is ongoing at multiple clinical sites in Belgium and the United States."
What a great buying opportunity today!

"from bikerieder on twitter:when pressed by madhu Kumar on talks with the fda concerning streamlining the aat trial, here was ca's response: Ca on aat study: “so Javier is probably dying to answer that question…but I can’t let him…here’s the deal. We were so excited about those data for a lot of reasons. I believe that it suggested this drug is doing what we wanted to do. In fact, doing a bit faster than we expected. And so we are going with those data and probably some additional data to the fda to talk about changing endpoints and changing size and maybe changing the duration of the study. Until we have those discussions, it’s probably not appropriate for us to speculate on the specifics of what those changes could be. I don’t want to get out in front of this conversation. We’ve had a very good collaborative relationship with the fda as it relates to this program, we expect this to continue to be collaborative, and I just don’t want to jeopardize that. I want to have the discussion, an open discussion with them and then come back to you and tell you what we have decided together.”then Mariano: ""BIG STEP, $ARWR ARO-AAT showing polymer reduction both in liver cells and in serum. $TAK must have been convinced Arrowhead Pharma’s drug for A1AD will be a winner!

Hopefully, there will be additional 4/5 Vaccines coming in 3-12 months (like $NVAX,$OCGN Covaxin with Bharat Biotech); which is good for the consumers, more competitions will bring more effective vaccines with lower cost for us !! So my opinion is COVID19 vaccine market is huge and will have room for all the great companies for the next 5-6 years or more. Hold the horses and seat tight."

JNJ was ~$148 before Q4 numbers were released in early 2018. Amazing how far we have fallen. Over $20/share. BTW both quarters beat. Thank God other wise we would be below $100 today. Not sure what the catalyst will be to get back to the $140s. Meanwhile for those who reinvest their dividends we all get a few more shares at these price points.
Buy SGYPFDA will approve Truelance for two more applications next Wednesday. This will increase sales projections of Truelance past $1 billion in sales by 2020. Also makes a buyout target now. 75 million short of a float that’s 150 million makes it 50 percent short or $10 to $15 a share.
"@Walter white,Do you have nothing betterror to do than surf the Internet looking for anything you can use to badmouth jnj?It seems anything will do irrespective of wether it's relevant or not.Judging by your numerous posts ,you were awake all night.Tell me , is that second mortgage on your overdraft keeping you awake?Maybe it's the nice man from your trading account calling in your margin."
I gotta say something here. JNJ has become such a huge disappointment in these past few months. A huge company with twice the resources of moderna and the same access to federal funds and yet they did not even start their first phase trial. All other companies are already in their 3rd trial and have signed contracts with other countries for their vaccine. Nothing justified having this stock above 150 back in April (which by the way i believe is a result of stock manipulation). I am going to change my position to short. Good luck to everyone
"anybody that buys this stock supports blood clots, cancer and free human testing"
"I just bought in, when vaccine is the number one coming up whats everyones price target ?"
OMG this is going to be so interesting. WHY DONT THEY JUST SUE THE FDA??? Probably a 10 percent run in by Friday. Just watch.
why is Jay in Jay waiting one or two days to release phase one data? that seems odd. I would much rather have two shots and have 90% chance of not coming down with the disease then taking one shot and have a higher probability of coming down the disease.
Jnj already had said that they weren't intending to make profit on their vaccine to begin with. This has no material effect on earnings either way.

"The logic of some people is ridiculous. The jnj vaccine is 72% 1 shot and its doesn’t mess with your DNA, plus no refrigeration. There are millions of people walking around with 1 dose of moderna awaiting the second one. So if 2 shots of moderna is 90% then 1 dose is 45%. So if I get a jnj shot tomorrow I’ll be in a better position than all the suckers waiting for their 2nd shot. People are so dumb. Not to mention the jnj vaccine is effective 51% against the new variant of the virus. JNJ for the win."
"Johnson & Johnson has a good balance sheet and is great positioned , it has much less downside risk than those pumped tech stocks."

Interestedly with all the recent share buyback news as a result of the corporate tax cuts JNJ hasn't announced any significant buy back. So hopefully they are going to raise the dividend this year > 10% Maybe 15%. Lets cross our fingers.
"In December JnJ presents results that were mediocre at best. If it was any other company the vaccine would have been rejected outright. Also in December Novavax announces prelim results indicating they have best COVID 19 vaccine ever made. Simultaneously, Novavax announce delays due to “manufacturing problems at EBS”. In this case it was because JnJ signed a contract with EBS to focus on their product shutting out Novavax. Now JNJ has convinced the government to give them full control of the EBS vaccine plant permanently shutting out all competitors.JnJ needs to be investigated and the money be thrown at their mediocre vaccine needs to be sent to Novavax so they can roll out their best in class COVID 19 vaccine!"

funny the news media attention and focas.the concern on not taking and holding off on johnson and Johnsons vaccine.thats not as affective and good as the pfizer.???
I truly adore this stock and the DRIP that automatically purchases shares for me each month. ;-)

JNJ used their experience making 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner to design their vaccine...
"If the market was neutral today, this would have gone to $135."
Sad and weak end to the month following solid earnings and strong projection on a COVID vaccine. The stock should be consistently north of $150 and not stuck in the mid $140s. JNJ is going to weather the COVID crisis just fine a year from now and the outlook is positive so why the weakness?
Halted

"I don't know how there is much of an opoid future here, given that every old person has had their opoids cut. Ya know, the ones that aren't evil drug dealers, the old ones in pain. Really, go read some of the statements online from old people that had their medicine cut, they are about to jump off of buildings because they can't take it, insanity."
Apples to apples folks! What is Pfizer vaccine efficacy after one show vs. JnJ?Answer: 52% vs 72% whats efficacy after two shots? Amswer: 95% vs ??? For JNJ. Jnj does have a second study folks on 2 dose efficacy so stay tuned and calm down.
$150s around the bend
Share price sliding to $125 is crazy - Q1 results beat estimates and outlook is strong for rest of the year. Don't understand the market at all - J&J should be well over $130 and holding solid given results and outlook
This has been down recently as low as 109. Is it too high a price right now (considering the gravity of the CV situation) to buy?
Nice day for JNJ. See you at $140 soon.
Boys and Girls ...It looks like JNJ is forming a double top and it might go down much more from here ~
Unusual put volume in the day and a half before the BBG story came out this afternoon. Seems sketchy I hope the SEC is paying attention.
"Ok folks, here’s the deal. $AZN vaccine is now approved in U.K. It now shows efficacy of 70% after one dose and 95% or better after the second dose. It’s being MASS PRODUCED GLOBALLY, is shipped at normal refrigerator temps and AZN is selling it for NO PROFIT during the course of the pandemic. Total cost to make a full dose (two doses) is just $6 and that’s what they are selling it for. No adverse allergic reactions occurred in any of the trials.What all of this shows is this new messenger RNA technology being used by MRNA and $PFE is WORSE than the existing vaccine technology. The costs to manufacture these vaccines using messenger RNA is TOO HIGH. It’s show NO BENEFIT at all over existing, tried and true, vaccine technology. MRNA share price will be CRASHING as a result. Things will only get worse for them once $JNJ rolls out their SINGLE DOSE vaccine. I will continue to short this stock back down to $60. The great news for all is that AZN has the vaccine for the MASSES. This will led to a return of life back to normal by spring, early summer.Enjoy!"
"Ex-Div date is November 24th. Current P/E ratio is 14.x. All the facts thus far points to a single bottle, which may have been tampered (my opinion). Investigation in progress... Anyhow, JNJ is a high quality American company and investment. There are lots of scammers and evil doers out there nowadays trying to extract/extort money from our great American companies. May God continue to bless America and our great companies that produce good products and life saving medical products."
Big pop tomorrow on the news!
$JNJ is going to fly.
something is brewing? up almost 3 up for this blue chip
"Two bozo analysts had late reaction today. They didn't downgrade but lowered Price Target. And as usual, opioid news from 2009. They see JNJ with plenty of cash so they sue for opioid even though JNJ are not selling them anymore."
If gern gets approval jnj will go to the moon.
"Unfortunately, this vaccine just isn't anywhere near as efficacious as the Pfizer or Moderna. If given a choice, people should definitely choose Pfizer or Moderna."

Why down when the market is up today?
Very good opportunity to buy JNJ at a discount
"Let's take out our 52 week high, get over $160."
Raymond James upgraded JNJ to outperform today (7/17/19).
"Speaking of technical, we are at extremely important and exciting point. Why? Because JNJ technical is very strong at this point but also there is a stiff resistance. We are clear and above 20, 50 and 200 MA that is very bullish. In addition, we are clear and below Upper BB ($134.19) but above Mid BB ($129) which is very bullish point and JNJ can go to Upper BB easily in near future.However, We have been at this point for a few times and JNJ struggled to pass it a few times until we broke it once in the past. So, the reason for hesitation is this resistance but eventually, JNJ will overcome this resistance and will head to at least $140. It may take a few days or a few times but it is heading to $140 one way or another. All JNJ needs some times and some patience. Oh, all moving averages are trending up and 50 MA will cross 200 MA in near future that is called Golden Cross. Most investors/traders will see it as a very bullish point and they are encouraged to put more money in the stock to ride and enjoy their gain. Good luck."
buy at 75 in 2021
Damage to the reputation of the JNJ vaccine has been done. No one will want it now.
"WHEW....I sold early! Such a great company, pays a nice dividend. I hate seeing JNJ go though this, esp. since I used talc since childhood.The article specifically implies that JNJ has failed in part in it's quality control and that MANY lawsuits will follow. We don't need for Co's. to be LAX in the health & safety of the product they manufacture!I'm NOT HOPING, but realistically, could these suits effect JNJ's bottom line? also...Think about the consumers wondering what's in the products that we use topically, will it harm them? & will new diseases/illnesses occur?THANKS goes to the tRump admin for his arrogant removal of regulations which is a huge part of the problem!"
BMO Price target 181.00 most others are close to 200
This is going down to the low 150s. Don’t be fooled by today’s action. The JNJ vaccine won’t be in anyone’s selection criteria- the top three they’ll be considering in $mrna $Pfe and $nvax . With $nvax in the picture there will be plenty of better vaccines to choose from.
"every day there is bad article written, oh it's not as effective, they don't have enough vaccines, they will produce it at costs, too many lawsuits over opioids, baby powder, it's not a buy. novavax farts some news and goes to $300"
Read this article. It indicates that in Europe the numbers are pretty similar for the same issue amongst all the vaccines.https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2021/04/13/why-would-a-covid-vaccine-cause-rare-blood-clots-researchers-have-found-clues
High tide Inc earnings today. Big newsPositive ebitda
Johnson & Johnson said it will make 20 million doses of the vaccine available in March and an additional 80 million by the end of June to fulfill a contractual agreement with the government. Taxpayers paid nearly $500 million to help develop the vaccine and $1 billion to produce and deliver these 100 million doses.
As mark said it be very careful about JNJ since it may go way above $140 without any notice or alarm.
Oof
Nobody wants this vaccine anyways. Moderna Pfizer saving the world. How’s this game changer doing?
"As for the financial impact, investors are overreacting by selling the stock. J&J has provided the shots on a nonprofit basis. Even if the company were making money off the vaccine, the setback would be immaterial; the company booked $82.6 billion in sales and generated about $20 billion in free cash flow last year."
Maybe JNG can find a cure for hangnails. They really neen to get out of the vaccine business.
"We need to be vaccinated against COVID19 EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT 5/6 YEARS until we have something permanent inactivated vaccine. World is new with this disease and so are the treatments/vaccines. We have 3 vaccines (like $MRNA, $PFE/$BNTX, $JNJ, ) in the USA market under EUA so far and we are glad to have those at any cost! Hopefully, there will be additional 4/5 Vaccines coming in 2-12 months (like $OCGN COVAXIN with 81% efficacy); which is good for the consumers, more competitions will bring more effective vaccines with lower cost for us !! So my opinion is COVID19 vaccine market is huge and will have room for all the great companies for the next 5-6 years or more. Hold the horses and sit tight."
"I don't get it, I think JNJ is worth this price without the vaccine. Maybe it'll wake up after they get FDA approval."
"This is down only a little on the news for a reason. This vaccine will be extremely important in the following month in the US, and extremely important, BUT extremely profitable overseas. Also, great chance this could be a yearly flu like shot for years to come. Also, this isn't even including all their other businesses, and channels. Long term reinvestor."
good enough to be approved by FDA

Great news! I like to hold long term.

so this was projected $2.5 billion a year - was that already accounted for to make the stock scream up a whole 1.6% today?
Any rumors of when JNJ may make an announcement regarding their in-progress vaccine?
Fauci just mentioned JNJ. Just saying.
"So, JNJ stays below 50 Day MA in past 3 days and before earnings. This may not be a good sign. After all, the market is unpredictable and we may see another large drop this week again to complete the correction."

The litigation reminds me of the string of recalls a few years ago. That was a great opportunity to buy a high quality company at a discount. JNJ was trading for $60. The valuation was around 14x earnings which is about where JNJ is trading now.

I want to see a chart of people drinking Coca Cola daily and those who used JNJ baby powder who both have ovarian cancer and see how that compares. Or a chart of people in the US who have ovarian cancer and those who used JnJ powder that have ovaria cancer. How about a chart of women who used hair spray daily and had ovarian cancer and those who used JNJ powder. There have to be more studies and you just can't convince me (as a woman) that using baby powder causes ovarian cancer. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSES CANCER OR THE PHARMA COMPANIES WOULD BE STOPPING IT WITH A NEW MED.
So funny this market is. JNJ beats all estimates but it is pushed down. Paid news media like Blumberg and Reuters try very hard to spin the facts to help shorts but they won't get anywhere since JNJ will recover and burns these shorts eventually. May be share buyback will help now.
I think JNJ may retest the low of the day of $156.82. I’d be a buyer around $156.75 if it gets there.
JNJ appears to suggest upside opportunity. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from https://pennystockplatform.blogspot.com/ which are working out pretty well.
JnJ is too cheap to ignore or not to buy
hey in on gern
Hoping to buy 120$. Do u think it will fall that far?
Buyers under 130 good job :). If we get another headline to drop it down I’ll be ready for more!
holding up very well
Lets gooooo
why would you be long jnj in a down market when there is much more bad news coming.
Down five before markets so this is today’s $JNJ expectations of down 15 today
I held shares of Philip Morris all through the 90s when they were supposedly going to be sued in to bankruptcy. Never happened. The legal system in the end doesn't allow a company to be so harmed that it puts it out of business unable to pay whatever any settlements.
"$DIS, $JNJ, $PG, $CELG, $WMT, $GILD, $AGN,$KHC, $IBM, are so cheap I can't buy enough of them. I am keep selling out of money put on each of them for weeks now and printing good money week after week even while they go slowly down. I am now buying bunch but that also put me at risk to get into Margin use as I have short out of money puts as well( Not worry as I will sell calls to cover cost of interest and still print profit) If I have patience I would make thousands investing here & holding for few years out. Dividend and profit would be huge. (I am making lot of money still but all money is short term and required lot of time to monitor) This is very limited risk investment out there. Buy before they move higher."
This downfall is only temporary. Take advantage of these prices.

With difficulties occurring with the two shot rollout on Moderna and Pfizer I see this playing right into the hands of Johnson and Johnson's one shot vaccine. No need to worry about having enough vaccines in order to administer a second shot. JNJ will have a 100M. Currently the rollout is at 38M on the Pfizer and Moderna. Looks like a higher stock price scenerio for JNJ.
Opioid Liability Train is a Comin’ (opinion only).
An appeal will reduce award to a few hundred thousand if that. BUY!
when is ex dividend date for JNJ?
"Besides the 15 millions doses destroyed, the vaccine is only 72% effective. Thankfully, I got the Pfizer vaccine and my wife got the Moderna vaccine. I'm surprised the stock isn't down much more than it is."

That's right--everyone, even JNJ bears!, expected this weekend's news and this is why shares should not move that much either way. Translation: the market is forward thinking; when it get things ""wrong"" is when times get exciting."
When u get the vac
"Like JNJ, think this vaccine has real promise, has 72-85% efficacy in U.S., with different strains-think it's 57% but other vaccines have not said theirs is 100% against strains- and is ONE shot only, when you look @ the problems with the 2 dose vaccines in some states. Think it will be added to the arsenal of Covid-19 vaccines, the more the merrier."
"These bogus lawsuits will not work with a trusted American company like JNJ, which has deep pockets and a large litigation team to defend itself. I am adding shares here and reinvesting the dividends... let the power of compounding do its magic!"

The BBC has just reported about JNJ'S covid vaccine on the 9o'clock news. 24th February. They are saying some very positive things about both JNJ and it's vaccine. Good luck to all shareholders.

Right now though it's for emergency use approval."
Cvst mortality rate is ~5% based on 3500 patient retrospective inpatient sample database 2000-2007. cVST rate with vaccine thus far is ~ 1/1000000...Steven JohnsonSyndrome is a comparative side effect with other drugs (Lamotrigine) which occurs at 2-3 times the rate with the same mortality rate....so why is this being halted during a pandemic where every vaccinated person protects themselves and those they may come in contact with???

In this post, I'll reiterate/point out that this is big pharma and has the power to minimize, if not completely removing a judgement and/or payout like they have done multiple times and will continue to do so.In my previous post yesterday, I pointed out, to those who remember or are aware, how corrupt and influencial even the widely known italian crime bosses had most all of the judicial and political system back way back in the day. NOW, we have big pharma that has the entire world under their thumb and will not be bothered one iota, guaranteed.JNJ always rallies into earnings...so if you can't read between the lines of the media nor able to see how JNJ is not and will not be affected through the writing on the wall I've just typed, I'm sorry and you should just sell now before others find out about the lawsuit."

Folks The Talc Issue and lawsuits have been around for more the 8 years!They will be finally laying this to rest. This is all baked in.
The problem with JNJ stock isnt the vaccine. It's how big the company is already. Their market cap is about 20x NVAX. If they make the same amount of money on the vaccine the impact on the stock price will be 1 twentieth of the impact on NVAX stock

The company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to market the mechanical clot removal, or thrombectomy, device in May and is launching EMBOTRAP II at this week's Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) 15(th) Annual Meeting.""The EMBOTRAP II is an important new device for treating stroke patients and an important advancement in mechanical thrombectomy,"" said Andrew DeNardo, MD, an interventional neuroradiologist with Goodman Campbell Brain & Spine, who along with John Scott, MD, Daniel Sahlein, MD, and Richard Paulsen, MD, recently performed thrombectomies with the device at Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital and St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis.The EMBOTRAP II Device, with its proprietary dual-layer design, engages and grips stroke-inducing blood clots differently than other stent retrievers, allowing a doctor to maintain engagement and control of the clot with minimal compression during removal. It is indicated for use within eight hours of symptom onset.""Blood clots can originate in different parts of the body, resulting in different clot types,"" said Dr. Scott. ""These different clot types present unique retrieval challenges during mechanical thrombectomy. The design of the EMBOTRAP II Device helps minimize these challenges and my early experience has been positive."""
Will Sybil with 150 personalities please leave the board. Don’t invest in the market if you are repulsed by it. Go JNJ all divisions!!!!!!
$145 at the close as Dow crashes into the long weekend
Class Action?
Was just reviewing my broker account and on 3/13/19 the last dividend drip priced in at $139.39. So bottom line the last 3 months during a very volatile time the stock has been flat. Lets see where we are this time in September. GLTA longs.
Pfizer's vaccine is only 50% effective after first shot
Muted the mutt We are friends. Just because.
Yeah this makes sense
"JNJ's trading range since March 1, 2019 has been ~ $135-$139. Let's see if we bounce back soon. $140 seems to be ceiling. Although I expect a dividend increase I doubt that will move the needle since it is an expectation at this point. My guess is approximately a 6% increase."
Buy more J&J NOW!!!!
not a coincidence ... the two vaccines that used aborted fetus caused blood clots ... JNJ and AZN.
"I am thinking about taking a position here. My feelings are that selloff is overdone as with many other bellwether healthcare stocks. The baby products side of business is very small and medical devices is a good business that is only growing stronger. Thoughts from the old timers is appreciated. Disclosure I am heavily invested in MRK. NVS, AMGN and BIIB and haven't fared well lately. I think all of these have been unwarrantly sold down"
Argus Research has a $165 price target since August. We’ll see how good their analysis is tomorrow.
Would be nice to close 150s
People care about profits. Not about deaths. World is going to hell fast.
this vaccine should be the safest one - so many unknowns with Mrna....this is just not right. Management should be out front on this but where are they. There needs to be some fired/removed managers on this debacle. Boolean
"Wow, with all the good news coming from this company I can't believe its not at least at 165. What do y'all think?"
"it is only one person and could be nothing. also, this won't affect jnj stock price. this vaccine is a publicity endeavor for jnj, so that's the only negative here."
Time to start accumulating
"Your children and grandchildren will be opioid soon. Opioid crisis already spreading out to the world. More addiction, more profits. Berkshire Hathaway is a biggest investor in Johnson & Johnson and TEVA Pharma."

Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
i know someone who dropped dead after eating a bowl of pasta in a restaurant..(pasta marinara) of course he didnt know it was laced with butter but ...who knows why these folks got blood clots
"The past three times JNJ announced a split, it was done concurrently when it raised its dividend:4/23/92, 4/25/96 & 4/26/01.Presumably we can put the ""split posts"" to rest for another eleven months."
"I beg you all, please don't forget who intentionally gave us this Nightmare and why...."
JNJ clears the way.....one and done..
Nice consolidation in progress prior to moving up from here.
"Lots of calls above this level that expire tomorrow. I held through earnings, and am looking forward to a very interesting Friday. Good luck longs."
$JNJ is DOA. Make room for $OCGN. - Happy weekend to the longs!https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/22/biden-officials-johnson-vaccine-484356
congrats on payday ! Sold some here and initiated ABT (hurting today)
Continue the green rally!
"Only twelve days to payday.Hoping to drip at these prices.you can but hope ,right!!!"
"To close the circle (for now) on $GERN, I just heard back from a $JNJ spokesperson re: imetelstat:“With regards to imetelstat and our partnership with Geron, no decision has been made yet by Janssen.""Tweet from Adam Feuerstein just now"
No Split. Let the price climb. Attract a higher quality clientele and add stockholder value that way. Splitting the shares only commoditizes the share price. Scarcity is the key to adding shareholder value.
Nothing is better than JNJ floor wax.
"Problems, lawsuits, downgrades, misses, dividend cuts.. J&J are finished. Will take years for them to come back. Stock will get cut in half from here. Dividend will be suspended. Get out."
I love my Johnson.
Great stock for long term gains
How can this be down on a 500 point up day? Laughable
JNJ will cut the USA recovery time by 50%
"Jan. 2, 2019 2:39 p.m. ETAngel Medical Systems Inc., a cardiac-device developer whose backers include Abbott Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson’s venture capital arm, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday with a plan to allow bondholders to swap their debt for equity."
I confirm...we will be GREEN or minimal down at the close...a lot of positive news will come today on this vaccine...a negative market psychology is also weighing on it but that too shall pass...plus...they are a great value company to buy and hold when it goes on sale. Boolean
"The market goes up and down. If you don't have the cash or guts then it's time to get out. You can sit on the side lines and say things that are negative about the market. Again, do your home work and be smart. I have long time holdings in quality stocks and they have showed gains through out the crisis. Also you have to be balanced through out the sectors that are moving for where the trend has movement. Then have a stock or two that shows potential growth."

how do I find out how often this stock pays dividends?
If you think JNJ is going to split buy BEFORE the split.
isn't jnj suppose to come out with more news of their vaccine next week?
its halted.
"the JNJ pipeline slide presented slides said Imetelstat was a planned filing as of Sept 13,2018. my how things change."
"J&J How low can you go?? Alex, it's time for a MAJOR stock buyback!!"
"Days ago, Dr Oz said a successful hcq test was stopped midtrial. Said it was successful. So why was it stopped ?Its been since March 19 that we heard of hcq. It takes 6 days. Its been almost a month, and virtual silence.We need to find out who is thwarting it, and make them pay for any lives that could have been saved."
I agree with Randall. It took 5 years to settle my car accident with only involved 400K. Lawyers on your side are great. Lawyers on the other side are trash money makers. My attorney got my once in 30 year 2 traffic tickets reduced from 10 points to 2 points. As usual it's not what you know but who you know. Will be the norm forever.
"In 2010 I had money that came off term deposit. To renew my term deposit for another year would have given me less than half a percent. I decided to buy JNJ at $62.62.I have had dividends every quarter, rising every year and some dividend reinvestment every quarter.Yes JNJ is down.No I'm not worried at all."
May close positive
Tried but true stock investment!
Down 7 premarket? What?
"GERN is on the move everyone, not bad price, definitely something you should really consider if you haven't already. We know J&J likes gern its just a matter of when. Sell a few hundred of J&J and go buy a few thousand of gern.Be covering both ends till buyout. either way it really is a win win for everyone. J&J is down .19 now and gern up .19thats a .38 swing!!! Just go buy a few thousand really is a great time considering we will all be one company soon. Look at all my post. I'm not a pumper but this is just to easy not to take advantage of"
Don't buy yet! Will be going down 10 more points within 6-8 weeks!
about time for a split
I hope some deranged manipulative individual doesn't publish another phony report on talc and asbestos to drive the price down again as it approaches 52 week high. GLTALongs.
We have been due for a day like today. Good luck longs.....

Well I'm ""sure"" you know, since you seem to be on top of all the metrics, but for others, it's currently 59."

Hey daily reminder internal memos show they knew their talc had asbestos.They literally sold a product for kids and babies they knew would cause cancer. Make sure you brag to your families about this
Clearly there are a lot of people here that don't comprehend basic science and especially statistics. This was a worldwide study unlike Pfiser and Moderna that just did US and did very selective regions so like one strain was covered. This study was global and covered almost all strains seen today even the more aggressive ones in Brazil and South Africa. Plus it's a single shot and is stored at room temperature that alone is incredible.

Let’s go $157
Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Authorized by U.S. FDA For Emergency Use.
The rate of deaths from the common flu vaccine is the same as the rate of blood clots from the JNJ vaccine. This doesn’t sound like an issue to me.￼￼
JNJ stock down on vaccine news. No good deed goes unpunished
DEA approved those drugs and Doctors prescribed them bottom lines. Zero responsibility on manufacturer. Sorry you Jack leg lawyers.
"Regardless, as seniors we have to cut back on most purchases."
"I love the dividend increase ,I was expecting it on Thursday but today is fine."
Only 88% efficacy for people without symptoms and 66% for people with symptoms. Not every promising.
Witnessed a young lady's collapse last Wed about 15 minutes after getting the JNJ vaccine. The CVS Pharmacy personnel immediately gave her an EPI-pen injection and called the rescue squad. About 20 minutes later she seemed to be OK and they were asking her if she wanted to go to the hospital. I left at that point so don't know if she went to the hospital.

If anybody is alive here and can read a momentum chart tell me this thing doesnt look like its about to pop.
JNJ going lower anyways SP 500 is almost broken. A break below 2550-2530 level and it's down to 2400

if this was a false break out i'll be furious lol
I really wish $150 would become a floor. Upward and onward. Let's go!

The old page was much better.
"JNJ stock is trading at $128.42 a share. So while the shares have certainly bounced higher they have not come close to their December 13th high. In fact, the stock is signaling weak relative strength at this time. Traders should note that the stock is still trading below its important 200-day moving average, this is actually a sign of weakness. Should the stock break below the key $121.00 support level it would trigger another sell signal in the stock. The next major support level for JNJ stock would be around the $113.00 area. Right now, JNJ is hanging in there, but this is a stock that I will be watching closely."
And I thought MO was getting hammered....
"This has been a bum stock for 3 yrs, I can’t believe people are recommending it."
"The world is waiting for JNJ's one dose vaccine. The price, manufacturing ease, and storage would put JNJ in command, with realistic universal distribution possible. JNJ does not have to make a profit on the vaccine, and will become the world's savior (making up for some past transgressions). It can be less effective than others (Moderna @ 95%, with 2 doses necessary), even as low as 70% (like a flu vaccine), because of the ease of distribution and one dose. We should know in a week or two the results."
"One hope is that the efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine could rise if it is given as a two-dose regimen. Johnson & Johnson is running another large study, enrolling 30,000 patients, testing two doses of the vaccine given 57 days apart. However, Stoffels said, waiting that long between doses will slow results. He expects results of the two-dose study to read out in the summer or fall."
Is JNJ going bankrupt due to COVID?
Doctors commit malpractice by over prescribing drugs then the courts want to hold the manufacturer responsible. This sets a bad precedent.
any thoughts on an option strategy behind the approval of covid-19 vaccine
I just heard J&J has set aside money for ovarian cancer victims. Any truth to that?
Every time JNJ has been hit with lawsuits in the past it has proven to be a good buying opportunity. Stay long and strong folks. Acquire some shares today and later this week.
"Hello you can contact Lauren Kudina, she’s good in forex trading and I have been earning a lot from her, you can contact her via what’s App if you are interested : +1 (662) 732‑0128"

It’s wild. Such a wonderful balance sheet but I just can’t invest in a company that has harmed so many innocent people. How do you justify investing in this to yourself?
"Correct Steve!However, Trumps plan was comprehensive and he had three separate vaccine technologies employed with two companies producing each.JNJ has big advantage because they are already prepared for mass production and distribution.Let is hope the vaccine has the highest rating ever!Hoping for a good move up on stock price. 7%?"
Recent payouts for Asbestos lawsuits will encourage trial lawyers to increase claims until JNJ is bankrupt. Watch closely and sell soon.
Still a stalwart! Love JNJ!
"You gotta look at the number of options traded - It's an ""Options trader Paradise"" today and someone made whole lot of money while this board was comparing vaccines. Is anyone here a medical doctor or this is ""blind convincing blind that actress was beautiful""."
heading back to 140+
Had to go out for supplies last night. Went down the OTC drug isle. Every Tylenol was gone. Every Listerine. I know they make other personal care products like Aveeno. You would think the Consumer division would have done really well this quarter. We all know that division has been a laggard for a while

"CDC panel recommends use of J&J’s single-shot Covid vaccine, clearing way for distribution"
"Mark your calendars! on 7/21 $MRNA, $PFE, $MRK, $JNJ and $AZN will be testifying before congress on the status of their vaccine, manufacturing and distribution plans. Hopefully, we'll finally get some truth!"
Think I'll stick with getting $JNJ vaccine rather than risk getting the virus by waiting an eternity for Slowvaxin.
"The correct word to describe GALT is under valued because it is only 2.4% of the value of MDGL. If both companie's Nash drugs are approved, GALT will outsell MDGL because Nash has no symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage, cirrhosis of the liver. GALT GR-MD-02 Nash drug showed statistical significance in treating patients with cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices and met the objective endpoint in Phase 2B trial. Based on the new right to try law I believe GALT Nash drug can be used to treat patients with esophageal varices, which it showed moderate Improvement in HVPG and significant Improvement in cell ballooning in Phase 2B Trail. I think it's time to buy GALT, before FDA finalized phase 3 trial. DD."
Hope everyone voted their proxies to get rid of Gorsky!
How many lawsuits will this bring?
Do we sell in a panic over the opiod litigation?
"JNJ is going to sell the vaccine at cost? I was doing some DD and glad I did. its very noble of JNJ to lose money on this vaccine but as an investor, I won't be buying this until the pandemic is over."

Any chance of dividend increase. They sure have a lot of cash
I hope JNJ won't knowingly put any asbestos into baby formula.That would be bad.
"Anyone disagree with the forward PE of 15 something? If that’s right, this stock is on sale and should take off."
"JNJ and GSK will dominate the Covid space in the long run. Single jabs at 10x less cost with boosters going to JNJ and GSK. Cant see how the cost differential and temperature storage can win in the long run.

"This will give jnj the reason not to increase the dividend. if this goes to $110 I'll add more. Right now, still way above where I paid"
"Question for the group , looking to get into JNJ or AMGN. Any thoughts long term ?"
I hope Jim Cramer is right that the JNJ vaccine is going very well in Phase 1.
Congrats JJ wow 
so I got a question for you why is the stock up on this news? if j&j is going to produce or sell this to the government cost are they going to make any money? oh wait I know if you can produce this in cost you could buy novavax and use their shot as a booster shot and wrap the whole company off uhmmmm.
JNJ is UNDERVALUED here !
"AMRN, TEVA settles REDDY/ HIKMA will do the same, Vascepa’s price rise 3% and JT floats $5B or higher if need to, expect buyout close to $50B $PFE , $GSK $AMGN $NVS $JNJ and $GILD"
"I'd allways buy and trust J&J the same time I'd sell Gilead with the wip of an eyelash. This is a good company, the other one mentioned, well not so much?"
JNJ coming back. Market selling off yet again near the close!
"This is easy money. This market is going to stuff money into stocks regardless of earnings, even with most of its equity streams down (like most others in the sector) this stock is still going up. Pair that with the attractive dividend, upcoming earnings, a vaccine rollout, a return to expected growth over the coming quarters, revenues from said vaccine, I dont see this stock going anywhere but up until maybe q3 2022. Of course this is my humble opinion."
sudden plunge in huge volume due to many lawsuits?
"yeah, the drug companies are greedy, but these were FDA approved drugs. IMHO the FDA and doctors who prescribed these are most liable. Why didn't the 'state' go on a campaign to warn of the addiction hazards and have the drug manufacturers contribute to that rather than sound the alarm and start suing years after this had become as its been called an 'epidemic'? Answer $$$$ & good publicity for the AG's."
We're going up from here.
The market is over-reacting. Hold tight. This is hysteria.
jnj big news. 1 shot vaccine out
"Dennie & SharkBait:My few days old reply to Shark didn't stick. To boot, I can only write one comment while on the message board. To post another comment, I have to go elsewhere, say, back to ""summary"" and after that reloads, hit ""conversations"" and post again--thanks YF.""The dividend pay out is Tuesday 6/9. Not sure how you get your dividend today?""Anyone that holds shares at Fidelity (and others?) and reinvests their dividends do so two days before div payment date. Fido buys shares and the trade settles properly on div payment date. No one got paid before the 9th.Dennie:""How do they figure the cost of a share on dividend day. I haven’t been able to calculate the price. Is it the average of the high low range?Good question and I do not have a complete answer.This go round, on 6/5, JNJ traded 146.60 - 149.64 and my div was reinvested @148.2654.For div reinvestment, shares are literally bought, so no, an average is not used. Fidelity knows beforehand the cumulative dollar amount it will receive on behalf of its accounts. I don't know what governs what time of the day (two days before div payment) it buys. One buy or a few buys? I have wondered if the extra demand for shares, via reinvestment has any impact. Roughly speaking, JNJ paid out $2.67B this past Q. What percent of this amount was reinvested? Reinvestment is spread across at least two days. I figure reinvestment has only a modest impact on the share price.Cheers!"
When JNJ comes out with their vaccine will this stock soar???
If JNJ's one shot offering proves to be anywhere near the efficacy of the two shot options currently available JNJ share price could see $175 in about 6 months time.
"I am starting to belief that JNJ has no upside beyond $150 without resolution of the talc lawsuits. I am not as concerned about opioids exposure. Now if we reach a settlement on talc the stock will move, but how likely is that JNJ settles? I do not think JNJ is at fault but a reasonable settlement would help the company shareholders imho. Anyhow, JNJ seems more like a bond proxy right now. We have a lot of support just below $140. We have the mother load of resistance at $150. Despite all the good news the stock is dead money at this point."
can anyone please tell me why Johnson Johnson hasn't split since 1999? I guess J&J has more cash than a knows what to do with so they don't need any more investors. it would be like a fire sale if J&J split two or three to one.I know stock splits don't increase the total value but when those split stocks go back up to the original per share price before the split they double and triple the total value.
$160 by friday
"I read your chat and say thank god I will keep my 7,000 shares of J&J and if goes under I had a great ride and still cruising my 32 GO TRUMP"
What's the new dividend again? I missed it and I can't find a news article yet.
Isn’t JnJ one of the leading companies in the fight against covid19? Isn’t it one if the first to conduct a human trial in search for a vaccine soon? Then why hasn’t the stock taken off?
Imo as soon as they're buying back the stock people are selling
"JNJ has developed a very good and important vaccine for COVID-19. The ongoing research to the one-shot (~72% effective in USA) is the optional booster shot---speculation is that will bring the effectiveness to about 90% . Also one can take Moderna routine later if one wishes, Normal refrigeration, easy distribution and fully effective in 14 days, preventing severe illness and hospitalization. This increases the worldwide supply dramatically.Remember that, ""the perfect is the enemy of the good""."
"Have you noticed many drug company commercials depict couples of mixed races. Big Pharma knows that when problems found primarily in one race, can be spread to twice as many people by mixing races, then in the future, they will have twice as many customers."
"Stock getting punished premarket. However, market needs time to digest. Stock could go green later today or next week after all of the factors are weighed out."
Hopefully this will be a breakout week for JNJ - Phase III clinical trial results for the covid vaccine and Q4 earnings as well. Looking for minimum $170 - potentially $175 or pushing $180 by end of the week
I'll take my chances with $VXRT thank you very much
"Just be mindful that although there are some saying there is no evidence as to the science or the cover-up alleged in the news article, multiple juries have been convinced enough to award verdicts favoring multiple plaintiffs that were not overturned by the judges in these cases and Reuters based their story on the internal documents revealed through discovery processes in these cases, so base your decisions to buy, hold or sell on facts, not faceless people on a message board with little to guide their opinions other than blind faith loyalty to a stock they are owning . Remember the tobacco industry lawsuits and the denials from their CEO's, remember the movie Erin Brakovich??? Real life situations where executives of companies placed stock prices over people. Further proof that companies and executives DO LIE sometimes!!!"
Is it too late to get in?
Every mother who used JNJ talc on their babies should have cancer too. This is crazy. The babies should have cancer too and I should have cancer cause I used their powder. Did the women who used talc douche with it!!!!

"What happened to the last 30 mins, there was no trading for JNJ? This is weird."
"While the stock price of JNJ is a bit rich, it's simply put, one of the greatest companies in the world. I've owned JNJ since the $40's and made the mistake of trimming a bit along the way, $95 and again at $120. The earnings were a beat today, but the headline number shows a $13B+ loss due to a one time tax hit. I am not a buyer here as I still have a substantial position, but also have no intention of selling at this point. The repatriated cash gives JNJ ammunition to pay down debt and/or buy back additional shares and/or do more acquisitions. If I had to guess they'll do all 3 just as they've successfully done throughout their history. JNJ is as strong as ever. Good luck JNJ longs."
Don’t fret and don’t forget - this is a cradle to the grave stock and will be around for a long time for we all use their products over our lifetime.

"Normally, I'm not vindictive but after running an Imetelstat job ad and Having Imetelstat listed on the approved compassionate drug list just prior to the (non) continuation decision....and then destroying Geron investors....I take gratification that J&J is receiving trouble for it's cover up of alleged talc containing asbestos. I do sympathize with any retail investor...here taking a loss as the asbestos it is not your fault. It might be a good time to move your investment somewhere else as J&J seems to think they are above the law when it comes to making profits from Baby products."
Wish i would have got a few more down at 115 :/
Just when there was some hope of share price recovery off the back of good earnings and litigation solutions comes this news about talc recall. Will this stock ever sustain growth again??
Time to either split the stock or replace the BOD. stock is trading in a range. Needs something to push it higher.
If this thing pop it will be on the noise of emergency approval. And we all have a good idea on it being approved. No surprise there. My understanding is that JNJ is selling the vaccine at cost to the government. That in no way helps the top or bottom line. Well we will see how it plays out real soon. Good luck. No matter your strategy on this the stock is solid and a keeper.
77% effective in USA for a SINGLE SHOT is consideredEXCELLENT !going to prevent a LOT of DEATHS.
"AVDL could triple pretty quickly $AXSM $JAZZ $JNJ $BHVN , very bullish"
Presumption of innocence. You're innocent until proven guilty. A company as large as JNJ should have snitches. So far none has come forward. Why is that? Were they paid off? Threatened? Or maybe they had nothing to hide in the first place. Read between the line folks.
I won’t get the vaccine until the JNJ vaccine comes back.￼ My wife got the JNJ vaccine last week and she had no side effects whatsoever.￼ everyone I know who got the other vaccines got very sick.￼

"When the analyst says stuff like ""JNJ disappoints"" with their vaccine it is unfair to label them this way. It is embarrassing to witness a stock selloff when you have a vaccine that will save peoples lives. We don't know how long any of them will last but to me a one shot vaccine that will keep people alive is worth a lot. Analyst have upgraded JNJ, but I don' think they have gotten enough credit for the vaccine. See what happens tomorrow, it was trading up after hours, but if another nut case prints something bad who knows where it will end up. It should be an easy 180."
JNJ just became a $400B+ market cap stock. The first time in it's illustrious history. Congradulations to a great company and to it's long term shareholders that have always believed in the core values of this company and the Credo that it has stood by for over 100 years.

JNJ stock blows other opportunities in the mkt to get rich
"University of Washington (UW) created a potential vaccine that fits every criteria needed to vaccinate the world. Trump bought vaccines from another company already from Europe for some reason... It sure sounds like the UW vaccine is elite choice. There are going to be dozens of vaccines to choose from it sounds like, which one is actually the best for Americans, might not be the best for businesses. UW vaccine needs to be #1 candidate as it can be stored room temp, 1 dose needed plus other points hits nail on the head all around. Side effects on humans you cant possibly know for years as there are so many different cases to come."
There are at least four cases of blood clots linked with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. So terrible news for JNJ holders
Sell JNJ. Buy Moderna
So is 65% a pass or fail? I hope it gets a fail for FDA.
So steady but really think it is overdue to breakout and get back to $145 - $150 levels.
What's up with the Geron product partnership? Moving forward?
Is it possible they purposely continued to sell this product to build a larger consumer base for their cancer drugs?
"JNJ has always said its going to sell the vaccine at cost and never included vaccines approval or disapproval into its net earnings forecast. so this is not going to make any difference to its profit/financials.This does give it bragging rights and a reputation boost. And, someday that will pay off.More importantly, this can destroy the up and coming competitors. JNJs vaccine is cheap, easy and its a one shot vaccine, for now at least. I know some people who have been waiting for a single shot vaccine. That doesn't mean JNJ is not a good investment at this price. JNJ is actually one of the safest bets in the market right now."

Nice
I just found a very different kind of biotech company that deals with various diseases in a very novel way and it might be of interest to JNJ. The symbol is NNVC. Take a look and see if you agree? I asked the same question on the PFE board where I also hold a substantial position.
Good chance $JNJ wants to buy $GERN prior to the June 17 oral presentation. Since there will be a huge increase in the sp the next trading day.
"Is JNJ COVID play done? Although jnj seems a good company with good dividend, I have invested in this stock purely in the COVID vaccine sense and don’t know much about what are their products in pipeline and how it will impact the stock. I have a feeling US already paid $1.5 billion to jnj to procure 100 million doses. With low efficacy, compared to moderna, pfe I don’t see US requesting for additional doses. So I kind of think COVID play is done. Any thoughts?"

And like Barry said Valneva is already has earnings report scheduled on Feb 25. Valneva was looking for Big Pharma to distributes it’s COVID vaccines in the US. Maybe Valneva and DVAX will jointly announce XXXX as it’s partner this Wednesday. That would be a dream!

Now is the time to Buy JNJ & CVS !!
Vaccine patents are a nonissue for JNJ. It was not supposed to be a profit maker. It was all done to help the people and Government and funded by Government. It was truly a nonprofit public service venture. Should have no impact on stock price.
there is also questions about how long these vaccines are good for. its a general question for all the vaccines that are out there. plus potential variances in the virus can make all these vaccines ineffective.so in my opinion this whole massive rally in last 12 months is on a shaky foundation. so hedge your long bets.
Next big day will be earnings report. Going to be between 158.50-162 until then . Enjoy the dividend next week. I hope I'm wrong.
I am not sure of what CALLS and PUTS are. One of my buddy said he is seeing lot of PUTS on this stock. He thinks there might be a sell off coming soon. can someone explain what PUTS are and why having lot of PUTS indicates there might be a sell off?

Isn't this just a one time charge? The territorial tax system the trump's tax bill implemented imposes a one time tax in exchange for not paying U.S. taxes on revenues earned in (and taxed by) other countries. This stock looks oversold today unless I'm missing something. The numbers excluding the charge were excellent.
Looking at a daily chart JNJ appears to be working on a cup with handle pattern. Need to establish the handle if this is to break out and stay above $150 then make a run to $160.
Will J&J vaccine be more save cause it's not mRNA based? Serious answers only please. I have trust in this company...

"One of the major reasons for global warming is population increase. So by developing drugs and vaccines that make people live longer, JNJ is a big contributor of global warming. Are you green ? Then you have to divest JNJ."
Regardless of the validity of the Reuter's article about their Talc powder having asbestos and whether they knew or not it's pretty bad news because even IF this was all false or just an exaggerated article from past lawsuits I wouldn't ever buy JnJ baby powder for my baby or kids.

"ASHLEY you should read this one its HUGE ADVERSELY effect as many as 170,000 in England alone what about the rest of Europe and the U.S.ETHICON PHYSIOMESH England Health Ministries Are Concerned Over A Large Number of Hernia Mesh FailuresUpwards of one in three hernia mesh repair patients over the last six years have reported needing a revision surgery to remove hernia meshThursday, January 10, 2019 - A stunning article was recently published by England's BBC, reporting that complications arising from using hernia mesh in hernia repair surgeries could adversely affect more than 100,000 and possibly as many as 170,000 British citizens. The BBC reports that the complication rate from hernia repair surgery using hernia mesh could be as high as an astounding 30% of England's 570,000 hernia repair patients. Many of the hernia mesh patients have been left in chronic pain, unable to work, and some even unable to stand up or walk. Hernia mesh victims have been rendered unable to live the once active lifestyle they enjoyed.Hernia mesh has been used in hernia repair surgery in England since 1990 and officials now fear that a cover-up may be in place. England's health officials are quoted as saying that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, England's version of the US Food and Drug Administration, did not do enough to listen to the concerns of hernia mesh patients complaining about the device's adverse health consequences. According to the BBC article, the Royal College of Surgeons continues to support the use of hernia mesh in spite of its failure rate. The Royal College of Surgeons said, ""mesh implants were the most effective way to deal with a hernia."" Physiomesh problems include pain, infection, hernia recurrence, adhesion, scar-like tissues form, attaching the internal abdominal tissues together, intestinal blockage, bleeding, and perforation of internal tissues and organs.As in the United States, certain hernia repair surgeons in England saw the potential for hernia repair mesh to do more harm than good and continued to repair hernias with the traditional suture method that had worked so well for decades. Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck was one of those doctors and she told the BBC that she not only continued to perform a hernia repair with the old tried and true suture method, but also has been forced to perform over 3000 hernia mesh removal procedures. The doctor is quoted as saying that nearly 100% of the hernia mesh removal procedure she performed left her patients ""pain-free.""Reports from England as well as all over Europe are important as medical devices are manufactured and marketed by international companies that know no borders. In fact, the Ethicon Physiomesh was recently withdrawn from sales by global medical device manufacturer Johnson & Johnson after German hernia complaint consumer watchdog Herniamed announced that they had received an alarming number of requests for revision surgery from those using the Ethicon Physiomesh.A report registered by the US National Institute of Health clearly blamed hernia mesh failure on the polypropylene component of the device is incompatible with organic tissues in the human body. The device has been shown to degrade, crumple, buckle, harden, and then migrate within the human abdominal cavity before lodging itself in the lowest possible point, the intestines and bowels causing painful lacerations, bleeding and potentially dangerous blockages.More Recent Ethicon Physiomesh Lawsuit News:Senator Rand Paul Chooses a Canadian Hospital Specializing in Non-Mesh Hernia Repair | 1/19/2019Hernia Mesh Patients Fear Comparisons To Failed Pelvic Mesh Devices | 1/15/2019University Hospital Continues to Use Hernia Mesh | 1/8/2019Hernia Repair Physicians Are Dealing With Hernia Repair Mesh Failures | 1/1/2019Hernia Repair Doctors Are Shunning Repair Mesh And Returning To Traditional Hernia Repair Methods | 12/20/2018Hernia Mesh Failure Symptoms Should Be Addressed Immediately | 12/18/"

"BS downgraded Johnson & Johnson to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’UBS said in its downgrade of the stock that it sees a more balanced risk/reward.“JNJ has outperformed the SPX by 17% YTD and now largely discounts a scenario where 2021 and beyond returns to a normalized pre-COVID environment. We see risks to this view, particularly within the Medical Device and Pharma segments. Our new Revenue and EBIT estimates for 2021 and 2022 are 11% and 10% below our prior estimates and are now 2%+ below consensus. We acknowledge JNJ is considered a defensive stock (2.6% dividend, strong balance sheet), but we see a balanced risk/reward here.”"
"IMO BIVI is undervalued at 4 cents per share with two FDA approved orphan drug designations.. ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 28, 2018 / BioVie Inc. (BIVI) (""BioVie"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage company developing innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an Orphan Drug designation to BioVie for terlipressin for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). BIV201 is a new drug candidate currently being tested in a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical study in patients with refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis. The Company previously secured an Orphan Drug designation for terlipressin for treating ascites, and is exploring additional Orphan designation opportunities.""An estimated 12,000 to 33,000 Americans develop HRS each year,"" said BioVie CEO Terren Peizer. ""Our novel drug candidate BIV201 could potentially become an effective treatment option for this condition."" Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome are recognized, Type 1 (HRS-1) and Type 2 (HRS-2), which are categorized by deterioration in kidney function. While HRS-1 involves rapidly progressing kidney failure with a high probability of death (median survival time is only 2 to 4 weeks), HRS-2 is characterized by a progressive but slower deterioration in kidney function, with a longer survival time of approximately 6 months. The FDA has not approved any drug therapies specifically for treating HRS and it represents a critical unmet medical need."

"It appears an overwhelming number of these blood clot cases with low platelets have been confined to an age group representing women of child bearing years, probably taking some form of birth control, and those in the beginning stages of menopause. Given the information we already know, I believe if you're a woman considering getting a shot you should consult with your doctor first about JNJ's shot or just opt for one of the other two available."
I think one shot vaccine is a failure and that's why two trail has started. The vaccine by this company may be a big disappointment and one reason to drag announcing the results and hoping 2 shots may give it a little boost like AZN.

"From WSJ...Plaintiff lawyers are hoping to make talc torts the next asbestos racket, but their dreams of mega-payoffs may have been shattered last week when a judge in California tossed a $417 million jury award against Johnson & Johnson .The case was brought by a 63-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer who had used baby powder for more than 40 years. She claimed the talc caused her cancer and that J&J knew the product was carcinogenic but failed to warn consumers. A Los Angeles jury in August awarded the plaintiff $70 million in compensatory and $347 million in punitive damages.Johnson & Johnson appealed the verdict and requested a new trial, which California superior court judge Maren Nelson granted after ripping apart the plaintiff lawyers’ arguments and evidence.For instance, trial lawyers tried to foist liability on Johnson & Johnson even though its subsidiary JJCI had manufactured baby powder after 1967. The judge noted that “the law is well established that ordinarily a holding company cannot be held liable for the acts of its wholly owned subsidiary” absent evidence that the consumer unit was an agent of the company, which the lawyers did not show.The judge also deemed the plaintiff’s evidence lacking. No causal link has been established between talc and ovarian cancer, as even one plaintiff expert testified. Lawyers sought support from an epidemiologist, but the judge noted that the “expert did not properly employ the methodology she espoused.”While the plaintiff attorneys then sought “to argue that epidemiological studies are not required to establish causation,” the judge determined this is “not persuasive given [the studies] were utilized for such a purpose.” The judge also dismissed the plaintiff’s unscientific contention that the condom industry’s discontinuation of talc after 1994 demonstrated its carcinogenic risk.“The documents and testimony, granting all evidence in favor of [the plaintiff] do not support liability . . . much less support a finding of clear and convincing evidence that a punitive damage was appropriate,” the judge concluded, adding that the “compensatory verdict is plainly excessive.”After the Los Angeles jury verdict, plaintiff attorneys had been anticipating a potential global settlement for talc claims that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. But they may get little or nothing if this is all the evidence they have."

From $156.69If it could not go up 50 cents in last 30 minutesAt least it didn't go down 50 cents from $156.69!

One pure fact: Greedy lawyers can distort anything for money.
Next stop for $JNJ is $85 bucks better get out and buy some $CRMD instead then eventually get some $GERN perhaps
"The stock chat is similar to Feb decline. If the same pattern repeats, $120 in three months."
100% effective in stopping death....gee...sell the stock.....INTELLIGENCE WILL SEND THE STOCK GREEN TODAY
"Zytiga is gone, almost $4 B revenue gone in one day and JNJ becomes helpless."
Look for the pop soon as Virus Vaccine news is soon to be out !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buying dips here...if any.
Look at the stock chart....selling is over...FEAR OF NEEDLES way too funny
"FDA is disappointed and this is what is saying:The company “would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,” said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition."
Time to buy?
Very strong. 150 is at stone's throw.
Momentum continues. This is amazing!
strong sell w.w
"There are about 7 million American received one dose of JNJ vaccines. All of them are eligible to demand compensation from JNJ. If $10000 for each, JNJ should pay 70 Billion for its fake and deadly vaccine."
"Good news: ""J&J is in ‘big trouble’ but ‘may be able to weather the storm’: LJPR financial advisor""But then again, it may not."
Watching the CFO interview on yahoo was pretty powerful. This is an amazing company. Great American brand that truly makes a difference in the world. kudos to all who accumulated under 130. Of course in hindsight I wish I bought more.
Blood Clots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Being late again, I don't know why JNJ is late in everything from vaccine to other things."
Looking good for higher prices. Long over 140.70 for a run up to 164.34. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/JNJ.gif
The next gamestop.....**BTSC** Oh yea!
Effectiveness is how well it keeps people out of the hospital. That's what I want to know.
The market is most unkind to this stock. Should be announcing a dividend increase next month.
Anyone have any feelings on the class action law suit from Rosen Law firm?
JNJ has very good pipeline of new drugs. It’s a good time to add/buy shares here.
My quarterly reinvestment posted at 130.0623 this morning. Curious where others had their's posted since timing of dividends seem to be all over the map depending on your broker.
"Going to green up soon. Wish I could say the same for my lawn, hehe."
If the Oklahoma Attorney General really believes that J&J is guilty then he MUST also sue the FDA and the DEA!!!!
"JNJ will be positive for year, just give it some times."
"Thanks, I agree with you about Value, that's why I don't see his BS any more. GLTA am long."
still holding
Come on $157 or below
Could the next big article coming out from either Seeking Alpha Motley Fool fuel did Johnson & Johnson sabotage Geron shareholders? To be investigated?
"This is not at all surprising. With all the suits pending and all ready occurring, some new supposed revelations was almost a given. Yes, the price will probably drop some more, however, it may rebound based upon what the response to this new allegation is."
I see based upon the money brought back by JNJ of 19B along with reduction in corporate tax a change in strategy regarding earnings in 2018. JNJ will see 170 this year as earnings will be over 9.00 in 2018.
"This is now considered a dip. Buy the dip, back into the 170's pronto."
"CLOVER - CO, $GSK DECIDED TO #DISCONTINUE THEIR PARTNERSHIP TO EVALUATE S-TRIMER COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE WITH GSK'S PANDEMIC ADJUVANT SYSTEM #pandemrix (AS03)looks like AS01 ( $AGEN Saponin ) is the real deal for vaccine adjuvants$NVAX $AZN $JNJ"
I think it's time to put an end to all of the ridiculous Oxy settlements aimed at bankrupting JNJ. This is a lesson that there is a value in having large pharmaceutical companies based in the US.
What about a vaccine from JnJ? Has anybody any news?
Buying more
Why is Jnj down today?
Why isn’t this going up?
"There goes $130, then $120, then $110, then $100! Then $90.. Game over."

Why is it going down?
There must be something wrong with me cause I haven't Goooogled awe.some.stock
Its sitting right at the 2018 December low .....should bounce.....baby powder is less than 1% of sales...and there's a fair chance this is tampering as well.
JNJ rings in with 66% efficacy with its Covid-19 vaccine....AND 13 people in Colorado suffer serious adverse reactions from their shot (Closing the site). Other than that......
I've been snorting their baby powder for years.

Making a long comeback off its Low !!
Gotta think this week we hear from jnj on vaccine...interim look based on events being reached
"“You’re much more likely to clot from the real Covid-19 virus, which is about 1 in 20 people hospitalized or even 1 in 100 recovering at home. That’s far more likely,"
Undervalued here......................................positive news is encouraging !
Who is GERN?
Also in my opinion lawsuits are going to flourish this weekend against Johnson & Johnson.
wow vbiv covid19 vaccine very good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice move for JNJ today. This stock is part of a foundation every portfolio should have.
you guys should all invest on the real Vaccine. NVAX
ex dividend tomorrow
"You have to love this little soldier, marching up and up every day. Less volatility than $JNJ!~Freedom 45, boys.~"
People after car accidents are in so much pain they love Oxy. Too bad they can never quit. Great for Business. Isn't that the way JnJ designed it ?
"can anybody explain me everything about JNJ industry ,thanks in every way :)"
what a set up here. going to get a nice pop on vaccine approval!
Do we go up or down after earnings tomorrow?
Sellers remorse. Is that a thing. Well it's on as I type this post. Congratulations to all longs.
"July 17, 2019 01:24 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst ColorJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shares are down 2% since the company reported a second-quarter earnings beat on Tuesday morning.Johnson & Johnson reported a 42% increase in net profit in the quarter. Revenue of $20.56 billion was down 1.3% from a year ago but also topped consensus analyst estimates of $20.29 billion. The company also reiterated its full-year earnings guidance and raised its sales forecast, but investors seem increasingly concerned about the potential negative impacts of opioid and talc litigation.Several analysts have weighed in on Johnson & Johnson since the report. Here’s a sampling of what they had to say.Near-Term Litigation RiskWells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said the opioid overhang could be settled by the end of 2019, but talc litigation could drag on.“The Daubert hearing in the talc case scheduled to start on 7/22 may give some sense of the strength of the case for the plaintiffs and defendant (JNJ) and thus offer some visibility on how many of these cases (85% of talc cases could be affected by the Daubert hearing) could move forward,” Biegelsen wrote in a note.Bank of America analyst Bob Hopkins said results were slightly better than expected thanks to strong international pharma growth and less generic headwinds.“Until we get more clarity on some of the litigation facing JNJ, we expect the stock to remain range-bound,” Hopkins wrote.Underlying ValueMorgan Stanley analyst David Lewis said an acceleration in the pharma market heading into 2020 would typically be a bullish catalyst, but the stock performance is instead tied to legal risk for the time being.“Our valuation analysis suggests the stock is discounting $35B in value but the path to clarity on talc/opioid is opaque,” Lewis wrote.Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford said there is still plenty of drama ahead for Johnson & Johnson investors in the near term, but the company has solid fundamentals and the stock has an attractive valuation.“While acknowledging that the stock will continue to be volatile on the litigation headlines, we remain comfortable with our estimates, expect revenue growth to accelerate in 2020, and believe the valuation offers downside support,” Bedford wrote.Ratings And Price TargetsMorgan Stanley has an Equal-Weight rating and $145 target.Wells Fargo has an Outperform rating and $157 target.Raymond James has an Outperform rating and $146 target.Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $150 target.The stock traded around $132.10 per share at time of publication"
"Why is jnj stock going up when they stated they are not making a profit on vaccine. Not a rhetorical question, I am curios."
kristopher here is a tipdont eat yellow snow.
"The 3, 5, and 10 year outlooks for JNJ have not changed in the last 24 hours. Buy the dip."
Today is an anniversary (besides my parent's) that should be celebrated by all retail investors.Anyone?
An article in The Street quotes the NY Times as saying JNJ's single dose vaccine is having production delays and will not be ready until the end of March. They're hoping for approval by the end of January but production is delayed.
love to get some under 130
"I'm sorry but JNJ needs to accept the ""L"" on this one. When you make/sell a product that turns out to be as deadly as these opioids have then teaching a lesson is necessary. Hopefully all the other companies will pay a proportionate share. And hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again."
"What about the law suits pending,against this very quality company.I had it for years but didn't feel comfortable with the legal matters.."
Does JNJ mean Junk & Junk?

"Finally getting some movement here - JNJ worth 130+ based on results and future forecast, pipeline of drugs etc.. However we have seen this before and gains are given up by the end of the week. We'll see if JNJ can sustain 128+ or 130+ by Friday close is the test"
Do I hear $160?
Had to mute mr walter white.. just stop dude
Jnj vaccine is good for people not stock holder 
J and J's vacine causes clots..... maybe it might at least work on rectile disfunction ?..... little blue pill or Reddit to the rescue ?
RED in pre-market. You should have sold on friday.
$150 tomorrow?
"Q- who has the ""complete vaccine"" ?"
no profit ! for share holders! really! company management should not get paid! until share holder get more
And the lochness monster said “one giddy”
Do you know the EPA allows 7 million asbestos fibers per liter of drinking water. Did you know asbestos is everywhere.
"The culmination of the speech delivered by JNJ was often criticism, bored expressions, and, sometimes, outright rejection; thus, after unsuccessful revisions and heartfelt considerations, I came to a conclusion: no radical idea, however expertly or clumsily delivered and written, will be unanimously accepted; instead, radical ideas will often encounter criticism without constructive comment, but this fact does not negate our responsibility to write them and take a stand."" We all need to take a plethora of instrumental stances that will integrate the long-term affects from the recent decreases that I believe are strongly unwarranted."
"Merry Christmas everyone and may your New Year be healthy ,safe and exciting. May you all achieve what ever your dreams may be."
"Nice consolidation. Patience is the key, path to 170 is intact"
"Cash balance is good, debt can be payed if needed, and gov money is sure if vaccine works out"
"Until the BOD splits the stock, its not going anywhere."
J&J now given up an entire year's gains - very disappointing - but div yield is still strong
Johnson is a ok buy at 100$...
https://www.wmar2news.com/news/in-focus/johnson-johnson-former-fda-commissioner-among-defendants-in-levaquin-lawsuit
In my opinion the CEO for Johnson & Johnson will probably step down
Go bankruptcy JNJ
"No volume, most sellers are active and buyers are new to this stock."
Has JNJ stated what they are going to do with the repatriated money they brought back? Many opportunities right now. Acquisition maybe?

Green now.
2 words.... PHILLIP MORRIS
mrk and pfe yield much more.
Unusual option activity on April 16 calls . 165 and 170 ?
JNJ is much more than talc though I admit that and band aids is what people think of. Trust is damaged.
Down but not a lot of volume. Investors taking some profit off the table. future looks great for us long term holders. GLTA.

"What's the different between now and before the J&J discontinuation decision? Now GERN owns 100% of the right to Imetelstat worldwide and will receive 100% of Revenue instead of 15% or 20%. It also has FDA Fast Track approval and very positive results in Phase 2, with survival rate of 24 months and still counting. Now moving to phase 3, with 183 million dollars in cash. In addition experts are saying that Imetelstat has the potential to treat numerous other cancers. Imo GERN stock should be going way up not down, with the possibility of a buyout."
Everyone is off today. Computers running the show today. Added at $123.89

JNJ presents today at 2:30 at the J P Morgan Healthcare Conference.
New to investments.I like JNJ stock. yahoo shows Forward Dividend & Yield 3.60 (2.68%).Question 1: Is the dividend 2.68% or 3.60%Question 2: Is the dividend per stock you own or for every 100$ you invested in JNJQuestion 3: Forward dividend yield when googled says when the stock appreciates the dividend also increases. Is that true?Currently JNJ is at 136$. Say it goes to 200$ does the dividend also increases proportionately?
Getting increasingly frustrated with JNJ - should be rebounding now to $130+. Check latest valuation at $133https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-fair-value-johnson-johnson-112519547.html
Wow huge day yesterday. Congrats to 1.34%. What a game changer. Ya nobody wants this vaccine or stock
"The largest and only fully diversified healthcare company can withstand whatever is thrown at it. When one sector is down, the others are up. i haven't seen many companies raise their projection for 2020, but JNJ did. Staying long!"
"What are you waiting on jnj, Perform a hostile takeover on tbio, use their tech and scientists to put out multiple different varient vaccines for all the new mutations popping up.

Johnson n Johnson Vs. junk science.May 02 2019Washington Examiner.A very interesting article and one I advise reading.
It's time to sue Reuters and really go for the whole company. IF JNJ talcum powder does not have asbestos in it and always been forth coming with all the authorities and regulators this is nothing more than yellow journalism. Freedom of the press also comes with responsibility of the press to be honest!
155 tests through 4 different methods in 2 labs and no asbestos found
but Geron already
"They blame J&J for the opioid crisis who will they blame for meth, alcohol, cigarettes, fast food, ect... Crazy times we are living in. What about the Physicians who were pushing these drugs?"

Nice rebound today!
CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review blood clots cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. @US.FDA Twitter.
Am I posting on the JNJ board?Have a delightful evening!
Who on this blog would like Salmon to find a hobby other than repeating the same talc and opioid comment?
"J&J attorneys provided Reuters with hundreds of documents and directly responded to dozens of questions in order to correct misinformation and falsehoods. Notwithstanding this, Reuters repeatedly refused to meet with our representatives to review the facts and refused to incorporate much of the material we provided them.The Reuters article is wrong in three key areas:1. The article ignores that thousands of tests by J&J, regulators, leading independent labs, and academic institutions have repeatedly shown that our talc does not contain asbestos.2. The article ignores that J&J has cooperated fully and openly with the U.S. FDA and other global regulators, providing them with all the information they requested over decades. We have also made our cosmetic talc mines and processed talc available to regulators for testing. Regulators have tested both, and they have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.3. The article ignores that J&J has always used the most advanced testing methods available to confirm that our cosmetic talc does not contain asbestos. Every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free."
"The Reuter's accusations are full of half-truths that spins a tale that resembles one of those YouTube conspiracy stories. You can't prove that baby powder caused incidents of ovarian cancer, because there is no science behind those claims...unless you try to weave in some crazy accusation of trace amounts of carcinogens. This is a plaintiff lawyer's playbook, plain and simple. Nearly everyone has used baby powder at one point in their lives, so is JNJ now responsible for all cancers?"
JNJ could supply the entire North America in few weeks if its approved.
"The global endoscopy devices market size was valued at $31.78 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $43.82 billion by 2027.With market cap at 69M now. Should see at least 250M sometime this year. 3-4X easy. Longer term it can go much higher and grow into a billion dollar company if it can capture that 5-10% of the 31-40 B market. There is a good chance this will be taken over with a huge premium, most likely by $JNJ."
"peanuts fine for JNJ. Wake up, folks."
man this thing is taking it in the rear these last couple days

I’d be buying CYDY. Reporting good data in treating CV-19 were JNJ is working on the vaccine. Plus CYDY Will announce by months end NDA for HIV indication
Oh man! Big buying opportunity!
Money first. Our lives last. Anyone surprised? Not me.
"J&J is one step ahead of others in regard to variants.Johnson & Johnson's phase 3 clinical trial unfolded as the troubling strains gathered force. That allowed the company to measure how its investigational vaccine performed versus these strains in a real-world setting. The result? The candidate showed 66% efficacy in Latin America (where the Brazilian strain is common) and 57% efficacy in South Africa (home of the South African strain). The vaccine demonstrated 72% efficacy in the U.S., where cases of the U.K. strain are still on the rise."
Lots of uninformed and just stupid comments on here. This pause in the JNJ vaccine is a common sense precaution. Very high likelihood that this will be investigated and found to be a very rare side effect (less than one in a million doses) and then vaccinations will be authorized again. All vaccines have low levels of side effects and that does not make them unsafe - have to put this against the death rate from covid at 1.8% with 20% having severe or long lasting symptoms and then these very rare side effects are not a risk that should stop vaccinations continuing
"Almost $10.00 lower than it was in January 2018. Yes ladies & gentlemen, the glory days are over.On the other hand, since cash is basically worthless, I'll hold my shares & collect about $617.00 in dividends every 3 months & spend it. If you're lucky enough to have money, start spending it. Just like with JNJ, nations glory days come to an end as well. When this nation craters sometime in the next couple years, it's going to be very painful for those who haven't prepared, & spectacular to watch for those who have."
Did you guys just hear that?
Solid vaccine briefing document!
Are all these lawsuits and unfavorable verdicts making you uneasy at all?
Bottom line JNJ followed the FDA rules and regulations with approved labeling. Doctors are the ones that are responsible for doctor to patient care. Sue them ! Drugs are developed to assist with pain and those writing prescriptions are to be held responsible.
Figures my dividend was or will be reinvested today--not that I'm complaining....
Long and strong but a curious few weeks of performance here....
yay saturday evening and kristopher is in his basement alone playing at being the avenging super hero with his make believe girlfriend.
"Sanofi's vaccine from France, with huge orders from the EU, announce they won't have a vaccine ready in 2021."

"JNJ ordered to pay 8 billion ? That's crazy. But they should pay something. And what about past shareholders who made money and are no longer shareholders. ALL of the shareholders who profited should be forced to cough up money. Its very easy to find out who owned shares and when. You shouldn't profit from hurting people. But I do agree, 8 billion is crazy, and the people on that jury should not be allowed to serve on any other jury, and should maybe be required to see a mental health professional. 8 bil shouldn't go to 1 person and a dozen law firms, it should go to all the people who grew breasts."

"This is how stupid this witch hunt on Big Pharms.The only thing these companies are guilty of is that fact they didn’t do more to control (they did everything they were asked to within rules and regulations).This “wins” by state just make so that Doctors are never held responsible because lawyers rather go after 1 or 2 big companies than 100,000 doctors. This saves them on multiple cases and big companies have much more money.Are we going to go after Gun manufactures for mass shooting?Beer companies for Drinking and driving?How much these companies do spent advertising negative effect? “Drink responsibly” “don’t drink and drive” “use guns in safe manner”… these type of advice is nothing compared to how much more pharmaceuticals advertise on side effects.These law suits are doing nothing to fix the issue, it’s just greed for money.Stop the doctors who abuse the system and blame Big pharma’s for their mistakes… the doctors can kill people and blame it on someone else. This type of scapegoating of Pharma companies sets a dangerous precedent to Doctors responsibilities.In the end, Lawyers walk away with pocket full of money, victims get scraps and when companies shutdown, people lose jobs and drug prices go up."

"JNJ Partnership with GERN paying a huge dividend, FINALLY. I gave you this at $1.90 last year."
"I am firmly convinced JNJ is underpriced here. With all the lawsuits and the vaccine there is plenty of reason to argue this stock warrants a higher valuation. The lawsuits have dramatically slowed down JNJ's growth, and the simple fact is unless it is fraud on a massive scale no lawsuit is big enough to take down this behemoth. In addition, the stock pays a nice dividend with exception free cash flow yield. The dividend has been raised consistently for an extremely long time dating back decades, and its credit is perfect. The talcum powder lawsuit is a pin #$%$ compared to the 1982 Tylenol murders. The bear case is less than compelling. There is a lot more to like about this name than dislike. Long."
Dividend next week. Hope to pick up some additional discounted shares before the adults enter the room and walk JNJ back up into the $140's where it belongs.

JNJ vaccine will be reinstated shortly. Small bump in the road. Stock has seemed to shrug it off. The amount of people who got blood clots from the vaccine is so minuscule that it’s almost as likely to happen as getting struck by lightning. The CDC is making a mountain out of a mole hill.

This is simply an overreaction in addition to a sell on the news. The FDA will approve this and it will be available within a few days of approval. Once everyone takes a deep dive into the data and calms down JNJ will still be a great 2021 story. Tuesday earnings results and 2021 guidance haven't changed. Those are the fundamentals that drive a stock price. Don't let this one day knee jerk reaction change your view on JNJ. If JNJ was 4200 today I wouldn't sell. As a retiree my major reason for holding this stock is the passive income the dividend provides my wife and I. That will go up at the shareholder meeting in April. I see a dividend of $1.10 at that time. GLTAL.
"Alex CarchidiFor investors seeking to turn a modest initial investment into millions, explosive growth is desirable. And unexpectedly explosive growth is exactly why many healthcare investors are now looking at the vaccine start-up Vaxart (NASDAQ:VXRT) with newfound appreciation. Vaxart's stock soared more than 90% last week when it announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate had been chosen to participate in the U.S. government's accelerated vaccine development program, and that it planned to scale up its vaccine manufacturing capabilities to supply its anticipated clinical-trial needs. Before these two announcements, the company was barely on the market's radar, in part because it only joined the Russell 3000 index this week."

"European Medicines Agency’s safety committee said last Friday that it has initiated a review of four “serious cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets,” including one death, reported after people received the J&J vaccine in the US. For you googlers, and real searchers: “As of April 4, EMA said a total of 169 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and 53 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis were reported to the database, among 34 million people who have been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the EEA and UK. By comparison, the agency noted that for the J&J vaccine, 3 CVST cases were found among 4.5 million vaccinated worldwide, for Pfizer, 35 CVST cases worldwide were found and 54 million received the vaccine in the EEA, and for Moderna, 5 CVST cases worldwide were among 4 million vaccinated in the EEA.” - post is from another board. Purpose: J&J is being targeted, figure out why."
Adenovirus vaccines like Astra Zeneca’s are less useful than mRNA vaccines.
Records of asbestos in talc at JNJ regards industrial talc that JNJ sold. Plaintiffs lawyers are trying desperately trying to make the leap and spread panic. They know if they can hoodwink the public there is a pot of gold for them. Total scam. The real question is this: Is Reuters in cahoots with plaintiffs lawyers? Or are they just #$%$ because JNJH didn't provide them with an inside JNJ expert to talk to them before they launched their screed?

"As much as I cannot stand $JNJ and what they have done over the years, it somewhat saddens me to see their vaccine halted, although I’m also glad it is for public safety. But the antivaxxers are going to have a field day with this and it’s going to be difficult to get them all to take a new vaccine from a company few have heard of. It’s time for IR, marketing, Fauci, social media, and YOU to start educating people about the Novavax brand and why it is best in class. Let’s go."
They must have gotten some of that baby powder mixed in the formula LOL
If JNJ's vaccine reduces the effects of COVID infection to that of a common cold.........then that's all that matters. JNJ is a STRONG BUY.
At $127 its a buy
That is right let the rest of the BIO sector Bleed RED. Everybody knows who has the goods. $MRNA $GILD $NVAX $JNJ
"$VXRT $JNJ Been accumulating this company overtime and I'm a long. Their oral tablet platform for vaccines has shown a lot of positive results. I'm waiting for the results that are expected this 1H 2020 on Janssen $JNJ partnership to create an universal Influenza oral tablet vaccine using Janssen antigens and they are also funding the trial. If positive results like we have seen in vaxart's other pipeline trials then Janssen is highly likely to move forward with Vaxart. Creating big opportunities for both companies. It's very exciting, this company has a big future with the success they've already shown over the injection vaccines."
The government has already paid them. Who cares if they pull it!!! It will only be pulled for a few weeks anyway.
"This vaccine has many advantages, would have liked higher efficacy but all things considered will be in great demand globally."
People dumping that 2.5% dividend for a 1.5% yield.....geniuses

Beat on income and revenues.
"Does a vaccine exist to combat the common cold? Nope. The only thing you can do is alleviate the symptoms. The same will go for the coronavirus, aka another form of the common cold. Any happy talk about a vaccine is just that. Buy JNJ because it's a great company and not on the hopes they come up with a vaccine for the coronavirus."
Hey when it's time to clean up the baby we all like to reach for J&J am I right?
"Hopefully, J&J buys Emergent Biosolutions."
If 500 k shots went to the problematic demographic group... the risk in that group is significant...

It was all fun and games when the marketing team cooked up the ad campaign. I bet they all got promotions for the sales increase. The CEO pocketed a big bonus. Thousands died every year. They danced. Now is time to pay the piper.
"I work for a large health system and we are collecting data on Remdesivir and its efficacy on COVID-19 positive patients. Although this longitudinal study doesn't have enough time or patients yet to produce a definitive answer, so far, the anecdotal feedback is positive. Personally, I don't think it will be the solution to COVID-19. I think another company out there will develop a vaccine, whether it is $MRNA or $JNJ or any of the others. But, this is an ongoing situation. I wouldn't bet the whole house on $GILD, but it is a sound company. GLTA"
I hear some people are talking the JNJ might end up buying INO. What do you guys say?
Looks like we got the 3 black crows going right now. It happens to every stock. Last time was back in November and then JNJ went on a nice run afterwards. Don’t let emotions influence your decisions.
Love that bishop billy bob has thrown in his 2 cents...maybe he should focus on his fellow brothers keeping their hands off kids. Leave medicine to the experts
The only thing I noticed that may have concerned analysts was that JNJ raised sales guidance but did not raise earnings or EPS guidance for the year. So @Iamdog doesn't have a clue what he is talking about when he states JNJ is not selling more. They are. However earnings seems to be flat. Either way very disappointed in today's market reaction to an otherwise fantastic earnings report.
Smart money is on JNJ and ABT
"WW wears a tinfoil hat and USA need more border security, looking forward a great Year with J&J, best consumer products in the world, merry X MAS!"
"JNJ has a good vaccine for the Third World, where life is cheap."
Great that no asbestos was found in the 60+ independent tests but here is the problem - with the announcement of one test that is now proved a false positive result the share priced loses nearly 9 dollars. With the 60+ tests that clear the talc batch of containing any asbestos the price only regains less than half the loss. Until J&J can totally clear these litigations from their books this will keep happening with bad news/good news cycles and the share price will go precisely nowhere as a result - its the story of the last 2+ years now.

"we all know the judge is going to rule against JNJ; that's what they do. These state judges always rule off their emotions. JNJ will obviously appeal and the process will take years to play out without any money being rewarded to anyone except for the ambulance chasers (of course). This is all news driven ""nothingness."" Stay long JNJ and add positions when the stock drops today. Of course this is all my opinion. This country is in desperate need of ""extreme tort reform"". All of these frivolous meritless lawsuits must end or corporations will stop investing for the future altogether. Aggressive marketing - what a joke!!!! Doctors are to blame for this travesty and pain swept upon thousands of unsuspecting patients. We really need the AMA to take responsibility for this mess - that is where the real blame lies. Again, just my opinion."
"Looking forward to a historic 2020 for JNJ. 2020 represents 26 years of owning JNJ stock and reinvesting in one of America's greatest companies, backed by a Corporate Credo that is the envy of the healthcare sector. Not only does JNJ represent the largest investment in our portfolio but it also represents 27 years of memorable employment for my wife who recently retired from the company with a life long pension. I can't thank JNJ enough for what they have provided my family. An extremely generous employer in addition to the greatest investment of our lives."
JNJ is going to run to new high next week. will pop after earning.

"In case anyone missed the following (located below JNJ quote)...I have previously commented my opinion re how JNJ may benefit (not so much) if it developed a vaccine. I proffered that some vaccines will be donated and that it wouldn't be a good look to make an outrageous profit from a vaccine, and thus, the benefit might be muted compared to some dreamers' opinions. Of course, JNJ is a HUGELY diversified company and not a one or two trick pony.Enjoy:https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-the-fda-may-approve-a-covid-19-vaccine-before-the-november-elections-according-to-jefferies-biotech-research-team-2020-06-19?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"

Does any woman posting on this board really believe that using baby powder causes ovarian cancer? I find that totally ridiculous. My cousin died at 28 of ovarian cancer and I doubt she ever used baby powder on herself. She did leave three young children and she had the cancer a few years before she died. I just find it totally ridiculous that baby powder could travel up the tubes to get to the ovaries. I just think the law firm is looking for a killing.

In the case of JNJ I’ve held them for years however today’s environment dictates that it’s time to sell some or all of this stock. With Purdue Pharma paying $10 - $12B to settle in the face of some 2000 pending cases, we’ll, this certainly sets a precedent a JNJ will certainly get hit hard.My suggestion is to take profit off the table, wait 6 months, and then decide if a buy-back-in opportunity exists.Remember, you can’t go broke when you’re making a profit!"

Does this admit guilt?
This thing is up solely on the strength of Tylenol...I have driven around to several stores looking for Tylenol and it has been nowhere to be found for over a month purely on reports that it is better in fighting Covid-19 than Advil. And now they raise the dividend..this does not seem like a prudent move since their numbers will collapse once the Tylenol demand eases if the virus goes into remission and JNJ is staring at a drop in consumer power across the board.
way oversold.
Most of you already know this but JNJ is like a big mutual fund because of the companies philosophy of diversification. Not even sure but I believe there are more than 200+ companies within JNJ. Each has it's on P&L. As a former employee for 24 years I've seen most everything. I was just getting started when the Tylenol crisis happened in Chicago. We weathered that storm. Several down markets & recessions. At the end of the day and moving forward JNJ is such a solid company that is will managed. Great lifetime investment. Pass along to your grandchildren one day. Steady as they come. Good luck all longs.
Johnson & Johnson (aka Janssen) vaccine - 66% effective at preventing moderate disease - 85% effective at preventing severe disease - 100% effective at preventing hospitalisation and death- less effective against South Africa-originating variant- single shot- fridge temp
"Although the ruling was less than 4% sought by Oklahoma, the appeals will drag on fro a good three years and the ruling nullified. JNJ produced less than 1% of all opioids in Oklahoma and the US for that matter. It neither engaged in aggressive marketing nor were their opioids popular among dope addicts. Oklahoma went after JNJ simply because it has deep pockets. Big win for JNJ today. Mark me, JNJ will be $160+ twelve months out. 14X earnings is a screaming buy."

I said a few days ago that a fair value for Johnson and Johnson would be 140.00. This is a great dividend queen on top of it. Even with the drug lawsuit Johnson and Johnson will work there way through this to a settlement. Johnson and Johnson has so many streams of revenues that I even see them continuing to increase the annual dividend again. Those buyers who are investing at this time are getting a discount on the stock price without a doubt.
Only 49 more states left to sue. Wait until they get to the blue states like California where they award big.

"You'd have to be smoking crack to choose this vaccine over the others. Less effective, made by a company that knowingly sold a product that causes ovarian cancer, and then can't event make the vaccine properly."

Not only was this a contractor but this specific manufacturing site has not yet been approved to make and ship the JNJ vaccine. They were going through the process of being qualified and approved by the FDA. This was simply an internal process catch in within the qualifying process and eventually get FDA approved. So pump the breaks thinking this was a major hit to JNJ. In fact the strict process quality reviews actually caught the problem which is exactly what you want to have happen. Its simply quality control at work within a manufacturing process. What you seeing in AH trading is the typical overreaction and people not drilling down into the details.
"For some reason, neither Yahoo Finance or Reuters have yet reported today's $25 million dollar talc verdict out of New York. Punitive damages trial to start next week."

The purpose of the suits are not to place blame but to grab money from companies that have it to fill depleted government coffers with cash depleted from druggies who abused the drugs, illicit sources of opioids and doctors that prescribed the doses! This seems to be an overt government taking of property without due process! This hurts us all in the form of reduced research and new drugs that could save lives. The court need to place blame where it belongs despite the politics of money!!"
WHERE DO GAINS STOP????SKY THE LIMIT????????????????
more and more positives being expressed about the J&J vac....and wait for second dosing....at 28 days it is already 100% effective for mod-severe cases = no hospitalizations or death...
RELAX..... I am sure many of you have 401K worth over $100K and your 401K balance also tanked today so did you sell all positions in your 401K?
JNJ is looking good today. Could it be people are realizing no definitive proof exists to back the claims of those looking for a big payday at the expense of one of the premier companies in America? It may take a while thanks to ambulance chasing lawyers and their slip and fall clients but in the end JNJ will win out. Keep collecting those dividends and adding to your accounts via DRIPs.TIA
ONE and DONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!speeding up global demand for JNJ
170 today?
Do you guys think it will get back to $144 by nov 20th?
I predict that JNJ and OK will settle this before appeals are heard for $100M or less.
this could pop 30 bucks dudes and dudettes
jnj buy out tnxp of covid9
Idk why the celebration for ah pop on a bad judgement. This opens them up to being sued and sets precedent. Let's see what happens after everyone has the divi locked in and what happens tomorrow.
The bull will end with Biden. Even Johnson and Johnson can't defy his gravity... I like this company but I'll love it at 
Mainstream just announced what has already been the neg. head line.BUY NOW
They had some interesting insights about JNJ on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Looking at the PPS from the last 12 months on dividends payouts:12/13/17 $142.77 PPS03/14/18 $133.3406/13/18 $123.50 This was when everyone (well trolls did) thought the bottom fell out.09/12/18 $139.31I haven't seen the latest dividend drop in my account as of this morning but I am sure it will be higher than any of the last 4. Bottom line JNJ continues to provides over $26K annually in dividend payouts reinvested in our investment account. Have been doing this for over 25 years since our oldest daughter was born. Both were the best thing that ever happend in our lives. I think JNJ has split 2-3 times since 1993. Some shares were purchased as low as mid $30 and many at mid $60-$70 when the stock was stuck for years under Weldon. Who knew that would be a blessing in disguise. GLTA.
Monday will be a great opportunity for an entry in to JNJ below $155

The shorts trying to keep the share price of JNJ down is similar to holding a beach ball under water. You may be successful for a little while but the end result is she shoots up higher. Watching JNJ continue to march higher and the loon kristopher lose his dumb(_Y_) mind.
"JNJ Confirms Asbestos DiscoveryAlready bogged down by thousands of lawsuits tied to its leading baby powder product, Johnson & Johnson confirmed on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found tiny amounts of asbestos in one bottle purchased online. The company says it’s investigating whether the bottle originated from one of its warehouses. Nevertheless, it has already recalled a lot containing 33,000 units of the product."
Why did JNJ insiders sell?
"Tomorrow, September the 8th is JNJ'S dividend payday. It's always good to wake up to a big fat cheque."
"If JNJ stays in the current prices then it will drop to lower BB at $136.60 at minimum. However, it tend to go lower to 50 DMA at $135.25."
"J&Js on Tuesday reported net income of $3.55 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 103% from $1.75 billion, or 66 cents per share, in 2019's third quarter. Adjusted net income was $5.87 billion, or $2.20 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.99 per share."
Sell now why you can before it goes lower.;)
I finally bought early today after waiting months. Seems the right time to me but don’t like buying at 52 week highs too often .
Because TD Ameritrade is alway a day late in converting my quarterly dividend payment into shares my shares didn't show up until late yesterday. The conversion price was registered at $127.8. I think this is the first time in years I actually benefited from the delay at TD Ameritrade.
"I, my mother, sister, and girlfriend have received both doses of the PFE vaccine, which is clearly the gold standard, and thank God for that. The JNJ and AZN vaccines are obviously poison."
This thing does not like 129
"""news reporting"" has become nothing more than a dash for clicks to generate ad revenue. sketchy stories often not backed up with hard evidence. i use to see it on rags like thestreet.com, marketwatch, yahoo, etc.. but now seeing more of it on once solid sites like reuters and bloomberg. regulation, and consequences, will come to the news sector to hold people/companies accountable. slander laws aren't cutting it."

Oversold. Monday will respond
How are those who were waiting for this to go sub 100 lmao how did that work out for you
South Africa is promised 9 million J&J vaccine shots - Business Day
"In my opinion, J&J has kept investors in the dark about Geron for the past 4 years. The Patients are Waiting and dying because J&J has been suppressing the information and the clinical trials to buy GERN cheap. If J&J developed this drug internally it would be in hundreds of clinical trials right now as opposed to just 2 clinical trials currently. ""The Patients are Waiting and Dying!"
I would use talc in a second. By the way - is talc off the market or still sold?
$JNJ to buy 4MTNA and nobody wants to talk about $RGBP Delivery System
"Fwiw, when you buy a no name biotech at 7 dollars, which is only trading at 7, and surviving BECAUSE of a contract with JNJ. When JNJ pulls out and your lil company crashes to 3. Use what little brains you may have and sell it. OR...you can watch it crumble to a buck. Instead of bragging about a 40 cent dead cat bounce and spending all your time railing on JNJ... as it accomplishes nothing other than to let everyone know what an idiot you are, try to actually LEARN proper risk management. One day you may accumulate enough money to manage others and even make a career of it. Glta and enjoy your weekend!"
Dips getting rapidly bought. Seems like this wants to go to 165-180
"When the results of a double dose are released, J&J will blow through the stock charts."
A downgrade is in the way.

"Purdue Pharm was fined approx. 250 million in Oklahoma and has approx. 35% of the opiate market, JNJ with less than 1% of the opiate market got hit with 572 million fine. Deep pocket ruling and JNJ will prevail."
The WORLD looking at buying moreONE SHOT DEAL from JNJ ........................................
Nice move today! Looks like we are starting to catch up.
When will this board split the stock?
Can it go close above 50 day MA at $37.58. If it doesn't then it will find a support around $134 which is low BB.
$JNJ has a drug that addresses a trillion dollar market: JNJ-3989
LOWER Lows........................waiting for some pullback before getting back in.
One hundred and fifty very bullish
Everyone who knows anything about vaccines says the JNJ vaccine is a game changer. This stock will roll into the 180’s next week. Should have been up $20 today. Dr. Scott Gotleib says it’s awesome news and he’s on the Pfizer board. Up over $165 in AH.
Johnson & Johnson Single-Shot COVID-19 Vaccine Granted Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization
"I don't think people understand the data around this vaccine. As more data becomes available, people will appreciate this vaccine a lot more."
"JNJ and ABT stocks are as close to a sure thing as they come... diversified, succession planning, solid management, need their products to stay healthy and above ground..."
Only down 1.30% on worst case scenario news people were dreading for months. very positive indicator.
The logistics of injecting one dose versus two and the speed at which you will become immune versus having to get two shots is like night and day. No comparison - JNJ for the win. Add to that the vaccine can be stored in a regular fridge for months and you know what's going to be administered in most locations - and it ain't Moderna or Pfeizer's stuff.
"Between $J&J, GERN, & $ALO I feeling real confidence going into this year!  Good Luck All."
"Actually - thee is a reason for the drop -""Shares of Johnson & Johnson fell 3.3% in afternoon trade, enough to pace declines among its health care peers and among the Dow Jones Industrial Average's components, after reports that an appeals court ruled that J&J can't block sales of generic Zytiga while the company appeals the overturning of a Zytiga patent."""

"I predict J&J never pays a dime to Oklahoma. Pity they have to incur legal costs to appeal the ruling. BTW, was the judge who made this moronic ruling on opioids when he ruled? Had to be. No other way to draw the conclusion(s) he drew. The guy should be stripped on his judicial robe immediately."

JNJ Vaccine Data News just came out. Its vaccine not as effective as Pfizer or Moderna.
The stock market has been hammered in the last 90 days yet JNJ is up almost 5% in that time frame. Not too many stocks can duplicate that performance. So yes even though we have seen a recent pullback JNJ is still outperforming the overall market. GLTA longs and yes we get paid in about two weeks just for owning this great passive income giant.
"Want to know why market is down? Because of surge in covid cases in texas florida and oklahoma. Articles are emphasizing the importance of a vaccine right now.

Any real thoughts on here or just spam.
"Pfizer's vaccine is only 50% effective after first shot. JNJ had a much larger study and will have results on their two shot study soon as well, so peeps need to relax."
JNJ down - 4.5% in a month. Junk stock. Junk vaccine. MRNA PFE BNTX already saved the world and NVAX is next up. JNJ SP will only continue to fall on its vaccine.

JNJ to buyout SRNE 
"Does anyone know how much of Remicade's potential sales were compromised by this ruling compared to what was already baked in? My sense is that it is not much.The one time charge to bring in the overseas cash is hardly a negative. Net effect is a huge pile of cash that is at their disposal to be used to add value which is a huge positive.There was some disappointment regarding the expected growth. Street is supposed to have expected a percent more.In summary, there may be some mild weakness for a day or two. The tax law benefits are going to outweigh the weakness quickly.

it's going to get approved again just like AZN.
JNJ has one of the best drug pipelines in the business and a fortress balance sheet. It's only a matter of time before investors return to value stocks. There's not many safer plays than JNJ.

It's gonna go up from here. nice support at 120. buy and hold!
Ok..last statement on this stock. The reward on this is about 60% for the down side 10% upside and 30% it trades flat. If you read charts this can pull back 50%. The best upside is 10%. You do risk/reward and make your trades..either way good luck.
Novavax is going to go up hugely
Nothing to see here...pull out and move on.
They will announce a dividend increase on the 26th.That should help support the stock price.

(NVAX), a late-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation vaccines for serious infectious diseases, today announced it has identified a coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, a stable, prefusion protein made using Novavax’ proprietary nanoparticle technology, and will initiate a first-in-human trial in mid-May. Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant will be incorporated with NVX-CoV2373 in order to enhance immune responses and stimulate high levels of neutralizing antibodies.NVX-CoV2373 was shown to be highly immunogenic in animal models measuring spike protein-specific antibodies, antibodies that block the binding of the spike protein to the receptor and wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies. High levels of spike protein-specific antibodies with ACE-2 human receptor binding domain blocking activity and SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus neutralizing antibodies were observed after a single immunization. In addition, the already high microneutralization titers seen after one dose increased eight fold with a second dose. High titer microneutralizing antibodies are generally accepted evidence that a vaccine is likely to be protective in humans.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-identifies-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-100010906.html"

"Personally, I would choose this vaccine over the rest so far just based on its 100% efficacy to keep me out of the hospital! I don’t like MRNA for its “messaging” the cells. I’d rather-have something working with my natural body. Just my 2 cents."

"Just think, if we cut the flow of drugs into this country in half, we would have billions and billions more money available to have companies like JNJ develop treatment for cancer and HIV, feed the poor, shelter the homeless. But with no wall, we gotta fight the drug crime, treat the drug victims, and pay to jail dealers. A border wall would help JNJ immensely."
Chances of 2 doses plus a possible booster for most of the World is ZERO. JNJ's single dose vaccine is a big breakthrough and tens of millions are available.

I think 1Q results should be strong. J&J and the market momentum should start moving in the right direction soon.
"JNJ has the opportunity to become the global leader in the women's VVA and VMS markets by acquiring TXMD. TXMD's TX-001 and TX-004 are expected to be approved and launched this year and have best in class status upon launch based on robust P3 safety and efficacy results. TX-001 and TX-004 are estimated to have peak revenues between $2-$3B. TXMD has zero debt, $148M in cash, strong patents till 2032, and Cantor has a $28/sh PT on the company. What is TXMD worth approximately in a near term buyout ? Approximately 4x peak revenue estimates or between $8-$12B...... Happy New Year "
Maybe this was the reason the higher ups at JNJ sold off a month ago.
It will be a small bump perhaps 165 on Monday. It is certainly a game changer because it is a one shot vaccine and with the ease of storage & transportation more poorer countries can benefit from this somehow. Wouldn't be much of a profit from the sale of the vaccine but yea we are buying the jnj reputation. I believe Jnj uses the safer well studied technology to develop its vaccine & not the newer mRna technology. No one knows about the long term side effects of the mrna technology.
"JNJ. LONG, the end."
"Just a few thoughts spawned by reading these posts. The FDA only requires 51% efficacy to be acceptable. Many news reports have smeared efficacy results together causing quite a bit of confusion. Intended result? Your call. Some constants to live by. A 2 dose vaccine will always yield higher efficacy than a single dose. A single dose will always require the highest dose tolerable to achieve the desired result. mRNA vaccines will always require extreme cold storage. DNA vaccines are always less cold dependent. Vaccine trial results today reflect major concerns at the time the study started. Future concerns will focus on 1) how well a vaccine is against mutation variants 2) long term and possibly mucosal immunity 3) midstream manufacturing shortages, 4) portability. In short, our latest greatest data may be obsolete in just a few short days/weeks/months."
Finally made new high for the year I am very happy especially when over all market is tanking.
What is the remedy for irresponsible journalism? Since when does Reuters do sensational and inflammatory journalism? Did someone make some $$$ on the stock move this article triggered? Hmmm.
"Just curious....why does JNJ have to advise of the risks? Isn't that the Dr's job. Lord knows my Dr gives me enough #$%$ about smoking. This shouldn't be on JNJ, this should be on the Dr's insurance. And it will be reversed on appeal."

"With companies across the board slashing and suspending dividends, jnj increasing dividend payments by 6.3% is very impressive ."
"Terrible results considering the two that beat them to the table are far more effective. 72% (in the US) from getting it and 85% of keeping cases from being severe? That would have been great three months ago! Today? Most would rather just wait for the two shot dose. I'm young and not concerned about covid, but if I am going to pump a vaccine into my body, which I plan to do so I can be guilt free when I ditch the mask, I want one that is the most effective."
"I’m a retired guy. All my working years I bought JNJ. Why? They are one of the few, if not the only one with a AAA rating.

Expect top-line results in June/July 2018. It has been manipulated and controlled by short players. Now that the Nash section is heating up I expect this stock to move higher. At $0.04 a share, it is probably the best opportunity in the market today. Buy, hold, and accumulate. DD"
WOW - My reaction is 6666 neat
"When comparing effectiveness, we should take into consideration the fact that studies on Moderna and the Pfizer were done when there was no variant Covid yet. I am sure that was the case with JnJ. I am sure effectivity of Moderna and Pfizer ate now lower."

""The good news about Johnson & Johnson is they've decreased the size of their trial from 60,000 people to 40,000 people. You don't do that unless you're expecting a large effect.""LOOK for the dips here................................"
it's kind of sad how this stock has taken such a beating for an article that has yet to be determined as accurate but the market is subject to speculative reasoning
"If GERN is such a great, cancer curing, company, why arent all the other big pharma companies, beating down their doors? Or are you just angry because you couldve sold GERN at 3 when JNJ first pulled out, but you rode it down to a dollar. Looking for someone to blame? Check any reflective surface, you will always find the culprit. Merry xmas to all!"
Huge gain today on the vaccine news!!!LOL!!!!
"As old as this company is, I would expect low PE, and good dividend....but No."

"I've been on a few juries and was a foreman once and got to read ""not guilty"".One of the trials I was impaneled on related to whether The City was liable for damages to the plaintiff and if so, the JURY had to determine the dollar amount of the award. None of the jury members were ""qualified"" to make such a determination. This took place on a Friday afternoon. After a juror stated ""I'm not coming back here on Monday"" a dollar amount was agreed upon. Our justice system is what it is, but again, jurors often ""get"" the dollar amount of an award off by a bit and that's when appeals and or a judge's commonsense comes into play. (read, I'd be VERY surprised if this award was not significantly reduced)."
For most of the World even getting a single dose is an arduous task. 72% is herd immunity and the virus will disappear. This is a breakthrough.
What is Alex doing????? We better be looking for a BIG stock buy back!! From 148 down to 127 a share. I hate to say it but Weldon did better!!!

maybe time to sell and wait?

Can someone please change ashley's diaper.The baby might stop it's incessant crying and we can all finally get some peace .
JNJ will go up eventually. But we are going to be under this overhang for a while it seems. JNJ has had these periods before. It always comes out stronger. Hold on to your shares. Let your dividends buy more shares. Buy more if possible. Be patient.
The fda will approve this Friday one shot as opposed to two and it doesn’t need crazy storage arrangements. Sounds like an easy win to me.
Don’t be scared just your typical scare tactics so the big guys can get you to sell and they can buy in lower.
Why is this stock down today???
"Next week on Tuesday, JNJ will report its Q3 earnings.Regardless of miss, beat or in line, most stocks go down unless the current and future income are raised significantly. Pharma stocks depend on future and pipeline. So they tend to go down more.JNJ may miss after all restriction on drug prices, tariff, competitions, lawsuits and many other factors.After all, the technical has become very weak and the market is in correction. The conclusion is to wait for earnings to get better view. If JNJ is a good investment then a paying a little bit more for shares is ok. Consider it as insurance. But if JNJ miss and future is not encouraging then you save a lot of money."
this sector is in trouble. JNJ will be affected sooner or later.
Been a nice ride but this stock has been dead money for three years now. Sold my position and bought more MSFT.
JNJ has found a potential vaccine!
"people like to buy at high price, and sell at panic drop. Great opportunity...bullish!!!"
Wall Street Journal had a full page spread of companies and individuals against the Georgia voting law. And there is JNJ
"Heavily loaded, see you guys in two weeks.... at new all time high."
"Beat earnings, announcement of the one shot vaccine soon!"
Company will be bankrupt in 1 year.Bad management decision
Like I said nobody wants a vaccine that is 66% effective. Why buy a Hyundai when you can buy a Porsche that’s 95% effective and even with 1 shot PFE/BNTX was 62% and option for 2 goes to 95% and some thought the single shot Pfizer could be even higher. Now single shot of PFE/MRNA is 80% effective.
ONE SHOT deal is the way to go.........................................................
"My wife is currently on this Bedaquiline and its the only drug that worked after 3-years to cure her lung condition of MAC. Thank you Janssen and Johnson & Johnson for the development of this drug. Janssen Announces U.S. FDA Accelerated Approval for SIRTURO (bedaquiline) as Part of Combination Therapy to Treat Adolescents with Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant TuberculosisTITUSVILLE, NJ, August 9, 2019 — The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for SIRTURO (bedaquiline) tablets as part of combination therapy in pediatric patients – those over the age of 12 and younger than 18 and weighing at least 66 pounds (30 kilograms) – with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided. Approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway based on time to sputum culture conversion, bedaquiline can now be used as part of combination therapy for eligible MDR-TB patients aged 12 years and over in the U.S. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials."
Incredibly diverse and resilient stock. Easy to be long on this stock and dividends paying soon!
Laughing at the paper hands who sold. Buying opportunity.
why should jnj affect the stock market futures when pfizer is the dominant and best supplier of the vaccine. More effective.the stock should be 100
You're more likely to get a blood clot from Covid than the JNJ vaccine. I get people want to see JNJ get punished from a share price but this not going to do any long term damage to JNJ.
$130 needs to be a new base - important price stays above this all week as a basis for acceleration as we go ex Div on the 27th
"JNJ one dose becomes the standard for most of the World. Getting 2 doses is almost impossible for most of the World's populations and this vaccine only requires a cool pack. At 72%, herd immunity will eradicate the virus before it mutates further."
ISRG just got a flex catheter approved for lung biopsy. JNJ recog the opportunity in robotic surgery but may have picked the wrong candidate.
"They lose the case, and the stock is up 4% in AH? Does this make any sense?"
Who's going to take any CoVid 19 vaccine?Thumbs up for Yes.Thumbs down for No.Sideways for a wait and see position.
Did J&J cut the size of its Coronavirus Vaccine Trial because they are looking to acquire a smaller firm with solid progress? A lot of rumblings about VXL being the target. Would give us a nice addition in the fight against COVID & a good jump in the Shareprice to start 2021! GLTA
"So far, it seems that $130 is too rich for some traders to hold. However, $129 is very critical to hold since it will put the stock in a range to be prepared to go to $140. Anyway, today gain isn't significant so far since it is recovering from last week drop by unfair and bogus lawsuit."
Band-aids make more money for JNJ than this vaccine will.
Today is ex dividend.
I see an pop of 6 boxs by friday.
what a boring stock.
"it stinks. change is only good when its needed. no wonder Yahoo is up for sale, they suck"
TTNP only a 16 million dollar market cap. They fight the opioid addiction.
Way oversold. typical reaction to headline news. Perdue pharma paid less than 300 million and Teva was under 100 million. JNJ has less exposure than either. any settlement will be a rounding error for JNJ. Sold June 120 puts and a boatload of JAN-20' 105 leap puts today. Ka-ching.
What’s this closing at today 131 or 128?
JNJ A CONSISTENT POWERHOUSE WILL SEE AN EASY ONE FIFTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now the latest judgement is for 8 billion for one individual lawsuit. Unbelievable. Why not just make it 8 trillion. The litigation in this country is so out of control. Great for the parasites and their clients but bad for anybody doing business.

Could we see a reversal leading up to earnings? I certainly hope so!
Bought in today. Asbestos claim/case sell off is way over done.
if they want more ppl vaccinated a 1 shot vaccine makes way more sense. they go once and don't have to think about it again
why did it go up can some one tell me

JNJ has realized that it needs to do some changes which is very encouraging. If JNJ mentality and culture has changed to take more risks and put people with vision in charge then recovery will start from this point.
Sorry bout your haul everyone. Time to sell and jump into BNTX been climbing for 2 weeks and the sole leader in the covid vaccine race. Time to buy BNTX just a few weeks away from phase 3 trial results
"I have been an investor for over 30 years and covid brought to us one of the greatest opportunity to consolidate big gains in a short amount of time. Now the vaccine race will give us a further push and regardless I will hold the this stock for a long time. However, in this specific moment, the therapeutics companies are the one with the biggest potential, after the FDA approval of Regeneron, others will for sure follow. And specifically I’m looking at CytoDyn $CYDY that already showed the best statistical significance with Leronlimab on CD12, other than a proven efficacy for HIV and cancer. And within days will be skyrocketing. GLTA"
SLOW and steady climb here.......................... till approval comes thenBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG ! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB !!!
Is it time for a split?
Thanks to the hard working employees of JNJ for a great dividend
Bought more today. Bring on the earnings tomorrow!
major breakout coming
WOW! CYDY at a steep discount right now. Showing great efficacy at treating COVID-19
"JNJ dropped from high $152 to current levels after the vaccine pause. It should be an easy retrace back to $150s. Anyway, the dividend is in the way, and getting some shares at current low prices is the best action in these volatile times."
Ex dividend date is Monday next week ! Silly to sell now
JNJ become a dead stock and eventually goes below $100 by next year since it cannot grow its revenue and competitions are getting ahead of the company.
Many states resumes JNJ vaccination. It is clearly an over reaction to the news. Astrazeneca has resume their vaccination too.
Realist view.... JNJ. Long! back to 140.
Stock needs to split. It won't break $ 150 but will break $ 75 easily.
I will buy back below $130
Tempting price!

I have joked here before about this whole talc thing and I want to just say I hope for all the JNJ holders that you make it through the storm and use this as a buying opportunity. Geron is struggling as well and perhaps one day the 2 will endeavor to grow together ! BTW farstain hopefully is not behind this with motley fool and shorting the stock.. he is a low life with no moral compass.
Wasn’t a covid play to begin with just like I told you. If you bought JNJ thinning it was your clueless and shouldn’t be investing. Hasn’t gained anything at all. If you bought for the dividends than it’s a play
How many scandals of this scam company will be unveiled today?
Oversold !!
Could someone explain what happened in the last hours Friday with the 1 point drop ?
Nice move today
"Per JNJ, their consumer unit performs regular testing to ensure its talcum and baby powders are safe, the company said. As recently as last month, those products contained no asbestos. J&J claims thousands of tests over 40 years have proved its baby powders don't contain asbestos."
"Does anyone know how the collaboration of JANSSEN (J & J subsidiary) and VAXART on the oral Norovirus vaccine is progressing , if at all ?. I am hoping that perhaps Janssen will also work with them on the Covid Vaccine tablet."

"How does one make money owning stocks you ask. Here's a clue. Buy stable, well diversified quality companies when they are on sale like JNJ is today. Be especially aggressive buying when the discount offered is a result of irrational stupidity in repricing the shares based on unsubstantiated allegations. Anyone buying over the next few months will look back and thank Mr. Market for being so over emotional and irrational."
If earnings are good and covid19 vaccine is good what can this go to. What is the partnership with Vaxart all about?

"Interesting post on the CYDY board. Looks like CYDY is J&J 10 years ago. All you need is a strong drug at the right time and you fly to the top of the heap. This is the posting:In regards to a possible partnership with BP. I see an interesting trend with the recent hire of Janet Flisak, Head of Cytodyns Clinical Operation. Now they have a job posting for an Associate which will report to her. Yet, what is perhaps more interesting, look at Janets Linkeden accounts she is also a director at J&J.. Another fun fact, Dr Rahman (Mahboobs) worked at Centocor/J&J. Want more, Dr Sanir Patel also worked there. It should also be noted that J&J has a strong interest in AIDs ( auto immune diseases) and made recent acquisitions (2020). J&J is a $380 billion dollar company.Is this coincidence, or is CYDY. a potential acquisition, or a partner?I recall NP saying that BP has interest after approval.Janet will be directing clinical trials.Im guessing this affair starts as a partner, but ends in marriage pretty quickly, especially with the HIV potential, and all other indications, and all the J&J connections."
Any comments on what people think J&J will do with Gern????

I’ve read before that JNJ sells at a 3% dividend yield less that 5% of the time. Now is one of those infrequent times.

Wow over two years worth of dividends gone in 1 day.
HUGE demand of JNJ......................................
Just let this early noise fly over your head....the EU will probably take JNJ vs AstraZeneca or others.....plus the second dosing and 100% NO DEATHS will all flow to bring us green or near green by days end. Boolean
Will buy at $80
No support below $158?
JNJ is getting hit from the Trump organizations !! Its a sell at this point.... I am not holding for now as he said last night he will lower drug pricing on all developers. Meaning the price points for brand names will compete against more imports allowed by the government. The pricing pressures will drive prices lower creating lower expectations and downgrades. I don't want to fight the government so I am out. GLTA but the president will kill Pharma.
J&J’s trials had the current variants included in the trials moderna and pfizer didn’t and that’s why they are working on a booster (3rd shot). What a joke pretty soon you will need a shot ever month with them.
Why is this still above $99 per share?!?
"Imagine this: over 50 years; thousands of QA and R&D test personnel, in many locations, working for multiple companies (including J&J) and agencies (like the FDA) conspiring to hide data that shows Talc causes cancer or asbestos across the globe. Don’t these people use it? Should I mention the talc can be easily replaced by cornstarch powder? The real conspiracy are the plaintiffs’ lawyers using their miseries to make a big payday."

"I'm a long term holder and believer in JNJ. I'm looking forward to the anticipated good news of our vaccine. When it comes to stock price however, once we get it, curious if we'll get a boost or some profit taking?"
When will this bottom out?
"I can't understand why all these posts are about vaccine effectiveness, and not about the actual stock since the vaccine has already been approved. It's clear that JNJ will start distributing it all over the world and make profits out of it, which will influence the value of this stock."
"Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies is excited to be Tonix’s manufacturing partner for TNX-1800, their potential vaccine for COVID-19,” said Martin Meeson, president and chief executive officer, FDB. “We believe that our team’s expertise with vaccinia manufacturing may apply directly to manufacturing horsepox-based vaccines.

Rumor is JNJ already has the pieces to create the vaccine. That’s why they can rush it into production in a short time. This is going well above $155 soon.
The 4.9 billion dollar verdict will be thrown out. If it should reach the Supreme Court it will definitely be dismissed.

Bright spots are far and few between in this market but lately JNJ has forced me to start wearing shades.

Monday morning announcement: a partnership between JNJ and Vaxart.
"JNJ will always benefit in this environment as product demand increases during viral times. I am a buyer on every dip and loving it. The world is not ending due to a flu. Mortality rates are very low and 30,000 people die from the flu every year yet corona kills 2800 and its all over. Its a ploy for wall street to reset and take your money. Wake up!"
"I still believe $JNJ will drop $GERN imetelstat. I guess we wait for later this month to see if I’m right or wrong. Nothing today changes my bearish view. If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative. https://t.co/UKOlyO799ETweet from Adam Feurstein This is the first time he put the possibility of being wrong into his equation. His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D"

Nice bounce today - long over due sensible reaction to the over hyped negativity with the talc litigation - note the posts on here correctly calling out that JNJ is yet to pay any penalties and no award has survived the appeal process as the science and evidence is firmly on JNJs side in terms of talc causing any kind of cancer.
Based on this weeks rollercoaster ride since Q1 earnings (basically flat) it looks like the market is not totally convinced that JNJ's grow story is that compelling paired with uncertainty over pending lawsuits. Will be interesting where we go from here. Like many JNJ investors that have been in this stock for over 25 years I take day to day volatility with a grain of salt. If the stock was $150 today I wouldn't sell any faster than selling it when it dropped to $127 after the Reuters report. right now I am looking forward to the dividend increase this month. GLTA longs.
love how some of the people use words to sound like they know what they are talking about
c'mon JNJ - save the world!!!!!!
"I am very happy with JNJ, always"
These buying opportunities do not usually last very long.
Dividend next week. Dividend increase for next quarter. Just wish the little run we had was delayed until the dividend paid.

"I watched the Gorsky interview by Cramer. One would think that if talc is a health hazard, those people that are exposed to talc, the miners, would have experienced health ""incidents"". In the long run, this will be a distraction, but perhaps a costly and long a long one. JNJ wasn't born yesterday, and for better or worse, JNJ has legal experience and will utilize both in and outside counsel. Dividend is safe. I remain long a reasonable number of shares relatively speaking."
"Following what I heard from Israël vaccination with Pfizer-Biont, the efficacy after the first dose is 52% or even below, that's why the second dose is needed. J&J efficacy is 66% globaly . Would that means that J&J vaccine is more efficient than others ?"

Major news tomorrow!
So on a red market day this will go up is what I gather.
jnj close to finding vaccine for chinese virus according to company
"AND it takes 28 days for the Moderna to reach its peak so what if J&J is 20 ....15.......12....10 days to reach peak on its second dose...BAM...200 a share...please kids...chill...did you notice, and not that i care BUT no analyst downgrades. Boolean"
I'm impressed that JNJ was able to change the narrative and come up with a whole new metric when they found that their vaccine didnt measure up to the others. Now everyone is talking about the ability to prevent severe disease. Well played JNJ.
This is the biggest dog in my port. i bought it because the were one of the major beneficiaries from tax bill and I figured they would buy back shares and at least eek out a small gain while giving out that great dividend. So why do people here think it will go up?
Trump made it pretty convincing that JNJ will have a vaccine. Let's keep him in office and watch this stock soar!

The deal came after Purdue lost a bid to delay a trial in the case, which had been set for May 28.Hunter's 2017 lawsuit accused Purdue, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd of deceptive marketing that played down the risks of addiction associated with opioid pain drugs while overstating their benefits.The companies deny wrongdoing. The state had been seeking more than $20 billion in damages, according to court papers. The settlement covers only Purdue, leaving claims pending against J&J and Teva, the source said."""

"Since when did JNJ become so volatile ? Up $3, down $2, Up $1, down $2. Geeze I cant keep up lol. Just pick a direction and go. Hopefully we reach $140 again by the end of the year!!"

"Looking back on 2020 dividend price points.3-11-20: $135.806-10-20: $147.809-8-20: $147.9212-8-20: $151.53Your dates and prices may be different but 2021 is already looking like a great year and a nice appreciationof 2020 dividends. This a simple example of how a dividend reinvestment strategy pays off for true investors in JNJ. GLTA as we approach 3 significant announcements. Earning, Phase 3 trail findings and FDA approaval of the first 1 shot Covid vaccine that will be a game changer in getting shots into the arms of world."
Is dividend holding down JNJ? One step up and two steps down so far in past several weeks. MRK is to roof in past 2 years while JNJ barely can go green in very green days.

"I feel bad for the person who bought JNJ, NVDA and Apple at their 52 week highs"
Efficacy of JNJ Coronavirus vaccine is disappointing. I'm not buying the Dr. Fauci hype that it doesn't matter because something is better than nothing. Nothing is not the option the public is facing. They will reject the JNJ vaccine. Go back to the lab and get it to work.
"Cordis is that a subsidiay of JNJA lawsuit has been filed against Cordis Corporation by a group of 12 people who were injured by defective TrapEase or OptEase Vena Cava Filters. Daily Hornet on January 22, 2019One of the plaintiffs is Robert E. B., a man from Texas who was implanted with the TrapEase IVC Filter in 2007. He is seeking compensation for injuries related to occlusion of the filter and thrombosis (blood clots). Furthermore, the filter can’t be removed.The 6th plaintiff is Samantha J. S., a woman from Alabama who was implanted with the OptEase IVC Filter on March 17, 2017. She underwent 2 failed retrieval attempts. The first attempt failed because the filter was embedded in her vein. The second attempt involved a complex dual approach, but the hook of the filter was embedded. There is additional evidence that she now suffers from chronic filter occlusion and was diagnosed with post-thrombotic syndrome.The 7th plaintiff is Ronald J. K., a man from Florida who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on March 26, 2008. He suffers from a filter that is occluded with blood clots.The 8th plaintiff is Jan George H., a man from New Jersey who was implanted with an OptEase IVC Filter in 2003. A CT scan of his abdomen shows that the filter has migrated up his vein, placing the top half of the filter above the kidney vein.The 10th plaintiff is Matthew T., a man from Alabama who was implanted with an OptEase IVC Filter on September 28, 2012. A CT scan of his abdomen shows that he suffers from an occlusion of the IVC Filter representing chronic thrombus (blood clots).The 11th plaintiff is Peggy S., a woman from Missouri who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on July 23, 2014. She underwent a successful complex retrieval of the filter via a dual approach. During the procedure, it was determined that the filter had fractured and one strut was left behind in the patient’s body.The 12th plaintiff is Virginia W., a woman from New York who was implanted with a TrapEase IVC Filter on November 1, 2010. A CT scan of her abdomen shows that all 6 prongs of the filter have perforated her vein. There is also evidence of a calcified blood clot (thrombus) in the filter.All of the plaintiffs have suffered life-threatening injuries and damages, and required extensive medical care and treatment. The plaintiffs suffered and will continue to suffer significant medical expenses, and pain and suffering, and other damages.Lawyers accuse Cordis Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, and Confluent Medical Technologies of negligence for selling defective medical devices and failing to warn about side effects.The lawsuit was filed on December 20, 2018 in the First Judicial District of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas — Case No. RG18933991."
"90% of you deserve to lose your money. You buy a stock with zero knowledge on vaccines or stocks. This isn’t a slot machine in Vegas. Let’s just buy a stock call it a game changer. Anyone with knowledge of vaccines, US sales agreements, world sales, JNJ price action would of not of bought this stock thinking it would take off. Educate yourself before you roll the dice."

Dow up 155 and JNJ down 4 days in a row? Everything changed since the Trump executive orders Friday. Cramer pump the stock to $151 plus to let his buddies in Wall St get out before the Trump news.

Where is JNJ with the race to a vaccine? I have heard of other companies on the news testing but not JNJ.....

"a major reason for the stock market crash was the acceptance if the Reuters story on asbestos. Some influential funds look for news like this to scare the market and create an opportunity for these greedy thieves. The reporter cones on CNBC and clearly shows that there us no substance to her article. Well, she wanted 15 minutes of Fame and she is going to get a few more minutes in court. in the meantime, a lot of people got hurt."

Buy and hold JNJ if you want to make money.
Big pharma stocks are peaked. Stock market is tired. No way to buy at this point.
Geron BO would send this stock over 15O EOY

I bet they drop their dividend slightly from the 60+% payout now to a few percent less. Tiny drop in yield. Huge company with tons of cash. Strange times indeed.
Guys pull out now it’s gonna dip even further to 130-135
Great value at this price. Buying more.
JNJ vaccine is a game-changer1- It costs much less2- Does not need special storage3- Easy and cheap to transport to the vaccination places. 4- Efficacy can be increased and be compatible with a second shot.
So the new nasal drug for depression warns you of the The possibilities of symptoms associated with depression. Lol
Heard the rumors $JNJ buying $PTLA wooow taking advantage now
JNJ will go down to $140 after vaccine news...will be a nice entry point to wait for!
"ok I'm going in I thought it would go down 5 dollars but its down 3 now so this is a win win, no matter what plus it could be at 160 in sep, hopefully"
Nothing but bad news with this stock and it goes up. Nothing but good news for Pfizer. What is wrong with this market?
Long JNJ. Good things in the pipeline!
Recover some tomorrow? Let’s see.
Buying Opp!!!
Today 130?
"bid the 100.00 a share, see if tbio bites or Sanofi raisesSektor"
Is the dividend safe?
"It's looking to add to long positions. Will wait for this latest drop to stabilize and then sell put options for strike price $125 for less than one month duration. If it hits the price, I'll buy. Otherwise pocket the premium."
$170 tomorrow
As always the stock market is over reacting. My wife was given the vaccine last week. Zero side effects. Her arm didn’t even hurt. I get the concerns but 6 out of over 7 million vaccines in arms. If 6 people actually died from 7 million cars of Covid it wouldn’t have been a story. This too shall pass.
Nice run up to ex-dividend. Could finish the year on a new high.
Stay down. Buying Thursday from every two week contribution. Thanks for the Christmas present!
"I dont understand that hype about ""J&J single-dose vaccine is 'absolutely' a game changer"". The mRNA vaccines of BNTX/PFE and MRNA are nearly the same ""less"" effective after one shot. The difference: They wanted to bring the efficacy as high as possible with the second shot. If its about life, the only thing that counts is the efficacy of a medicine or vaccine. I dont care about temperature or 2 or 3 o 4 shots. If I can choose, I m with the mRNA vaccine."

Great to see JNJ recovering. We will be in the 140s by year end imo.

"It's not a question of whether or not one can detect asbestos in Johnson and Johnson's Baby Powder -- one can, as asbestos is a naturally-occurring mineral that is everywhere in trace amounts. Sweep up dust around your house, dig a handful of soil from your yard -- you will find asbestos. The question is only one of HOW MUCH asbestos is in a bottle of Baby Powder -- is the trace amounts greater or lesser than what we'll call (taking a term from nuclear science) the normal ""background"" amounts of asbestos everywhere? And if the amounts are higher than the normal ""background"" amounts, are they high enough to have some impact on people's health?"

"Per my news section on my account - ""Johnson & Johnson Announces Collaboration to Expand Manufacturing Capabilities For its COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate in Support of the Company's Goal to Supply More Than One Billion Vaccine Doses Globally(PR Newswire)"". Sounds great to me."
People after taking the J & J vaccine
Fantastic quarter. Much more upside from here...that vaccine is going to pull the stock price skywards. This company is a must own for anyone looking for income and long term capital gains. This stock doesn't reward quickly though. It takes patience and knowledge of the fact this company is extremely durable in both good times and bad.
"Don't forget here that JNJ is the only leading vaccine candidate that is one shot and no special conditions for travel and distribution. This makes it the most likely to be the preferred vaccine candidate globally vs the 2 shot options and special conditions for distribution. Also JNJ has the largest phase 3 trial with 60,000 so likely will have the most robust data set coming out down the road. I'd bet on JNJ being the vaccine leader for COVID in 2021"
"15 Million vaccinations? How much is that worth in money. Then there's all the work and investigations that have to be carried out now. I bet it costs in the billions. Commiserations to anyone holding the stock. I have held it long many times, and have always trusted the company completely, not holding it this time."
Disappointed reaction today. I expected $132 + today. Most drug stocks are getting hit today. I added more am looking for $135 in 2 weeks.

The regimen will be marketed by the trade name of Cabenuva and will be provided as a co-pack with the two injectable medicines, cabotegravir and Edurant. Cabenuva is already approved in Canada and EU. The long-acting regimen will reduce the frequency of treatment days from 365 to 12 per year, thereby removing the need to take daily oral pills.

"JNJ is a colossal conglomerate with a very large cap and a wide area of business. Many people buy this stock to stabilize their portfolios with a solid growing company with the plus of a nice dividend. So this panic selloff about vaccine bad news is just absurd. Be proud of being a JNJ investor, hold your shares and don't pay attention to the noise."
"Again, so far many of the ""experts"" have been wrong, that is predicting a steep decline (retesting lows) before recovering in the 3rd or 4th quarter (or next year). Yes the market is forward looking but how far? Will we retest recent lows, with Corona rebound when we come out from hiding? Can't deny the effect of millions out of work and Corporations decline in revenue, guess the stock market does not reflect main street as much as we think. Let's not forget State and City budgets which are in dire trouble (higher taxes, inflation coming). How can the DOW be doing so well, I don't get it?"

Anyone care to explain the option activity today specifically the 130 puts expiring today that were trading as high as 0.98 and for most of the day were trading close to 0.40 when the stock was well over 132. Makes no sense at all.
"No clue why people post they expected more from JNJ SP. If you have paid attention to JNJ SP on good vaccine news last few months you should of been surprised. If you know anything about Moderna & Pfizer/BNTX and US vaccine purchases you shouldn’t of been surprised. If you know anything about efficacy of other vaccines and what they can be stored at (40 degrees for 5-7 days) then you shouldn’t of been surprised. All you who expected more and your knowledge on vaccines lacks a lot. This isn’t a game changer whatsoever. You call it bashing, but when I’ve been right it’s called telling you the truth. I know cause I’ve educated myself. I just don’t buy a stock and roll the dice. Without knowledge that’s exactly what you are doing. This isn’t going anywhere.

"@kristopher : You are breathing in asbestos fibers right now! Walk along the street nearest you and you'll be breathing in more asbestos particles than if you sprinkled Baby Powder all around your home. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral; it is everywhere naturally -- and the amounts of it is greater from human pollution, like the asbestos in the dust that has come off of cars' brake linings for decades causing asbestos to exist in heavier concentrations along our roadways. Testing over the last 40 years shows talc used in cosmetic products is, from a safety perspective, asbestos-free. Your fear about ""asbestos in baby powder"" is irrational."
"Also, short-term investors often look to make quick money by investing in a company leading up to a scheduled buyback. The rapid influx of investors artificially inflates the stock's valuation and boosts the company's price to earnings ratio (P/E). The return on equity (ROE) ratio is another important financial metric that receives an automatic boost."

"Corona treatment and vaccine will surely come out someday in the near future.And if the development is successful in either side, there is a high possibility that other pharmaceutical companies will release it in succession.In my personal opinion, Modena seems to be dominant in technology development, and Johnson & Johnson seems to be good at commercialization.Because corona treatment and vaccines are in demand worldwide by at least 100 million people, the ripple effect when they come out is likely to be more than what people think."
"For the last several years I kept looking at JNJ for a dividend investment to diversify my portfolio into that sector. I thought the price was high when it was near 100. Well, now that it has dropped from 148 to today's 129, maybe I will keep an eye on it, if the price drops some more. Similar to when I bought into BP after the Gulf Oil disaster. BP recovered, still pays dividend, etc"
For those who don’t know:Phase III Clinical trial data will be available at end of Jan for both ENSEMLE (single dose) and ENSEMLE 2( two dose) studies.Realistically any thing is possible to happen including a bad result or a better efficacy with the two dose study! So is too early to discuss the outcome.

Buy JNJ when others are fearful
Stock has been standing still for a year. PFE dropped on approval of vaccinewhy is this different?
DO YOU SEE JNJ TESTING THE BOTTOM ??? TA PEOPLE RESPOND PLEASE
this stock is moving! will beat earning 100%https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-stock-to-invest-in-for-the-Coronavirus
Hopefully....... will go up today
"I’ve been in this for a while, sold at 133.00 then bought back at 131, I’m in for the long haul , because I’m hoping J&J will rise again.."
"If JNJ decides for CD with GERN by EOQ, will be great for both companies. Long in both."
Don't know about you but I intend to vote no for every director and the executive compensation when I get my proxy. This stock can not break 140 or if it does sustain it. The stock needs to split. At least new investors might be tempted to buy it at $ 70 per share
Current drop is from brain dead sellers !!!!!!! This company is giant with good news every week including a new FDA approval today. Wall street is FIXED !
best stock to buy in this economy.
"There are doctors in prison for selling opioids in mass quantities to make millions of dollars off of drug dependent people. JNJ fraudulently marketing opioids per an Oklahoma judge which I am sure harmed many people. The only difference is people perceive this company as having a ""strong balance sheet"" and they want to make money off of them. At the end of the day, no one will care about their precious balance sheet. They will simply add up all of the harm they have done with asbesto, opioids, Risperdal, etc. etc etc. It will catch up with them eventually! Thank goodness Target, Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid and others are doing what JNJ would not and are pulling this talcum powder poison from the shelves."
Two top JNJ pipelines drugs are now dead less than 2 weeks after they were included in the pharma update. Certainly JNJ had the negative info before the presentations and still presented it to the shareholders. I think JNj will be paying off quite a few lawyers over this as it is quite clear they committed securities fraud.
"DarrellDarrell16 hours agoAmarinAs of early 2020, Amarin (NASDAQ:AMRN) had racked up a second approval for its cardiovascular drug, Vascepa. Now, doctors can prescribe it as an add-on treatment to the class of therapies called statins, which tens of millions of people worldwide take to reduce their risk of serious heart problems. In short, Amarin can now market Vascepa to patients who are taking statins, meaning that its potential revenue is much larger than before -- and the positive effect is already hitting the company's books.Sales of Vascepa drove the company's annual total net revenue to increase by 43% compared to 2019, reaching $614.1 million for 2020. But that's entirely from the U.S., and Vascepa is in the process of going global. Amarin will launch it in the E.U. later this year, and it may get another approval in China before 2022. Worldwide, the market for Vascepa could be as large as 486 million people.Finally, there's no direct competitor to the drug on the market. So, it's hard to see how Amarin could stumble, given that it has negligible debt and practically the entire world to expand into. All of these factors make Amarin a solid buy this month.Motley Fool article this morning..."

"BUY. JNJ is a large part of index mutual funds that are ""forced"" to sell in a market downturn to cover redemptions. They have to do so indiscriminately to maintain balances. Take advantage of the process!"
where does all these nay sayers come from. Are they people who shorted the stock and want to insight fear. Today the dividend is paid to holders who had the stock on February 22nd the ex dividend date. I will take the money and gladly wait to see Johnson and Johnson become the dominant vaccine worldwide
Can it go to $131 and stays above $131. $131 is a critical price.
Company likely will be send out DHCP letters shortly around the world. Black Box and limitation of use. Let the lawsuits begin.
"The P/E ratio shouldn’t be 268, correct?"
After hours is going to be interesting!
I would love to see JNJ either acquire or partner with a tiny biotech symbol ( the name is a real tongue twister) NNVC. They have the most unique concept in treating diseases. Their outside the box thinking completely bypasses the immune system. This could really be a game changer. They explain it very clearly on their website.
"Added at $110.10 this morning, We have not seen these levels in a long time."

Anyone have any idea why the $2 bump this morning?Very welcome and reflects the strong earnings
"I have to tell these patients and their lawyers get a sign that says: "" help me with my sickness"" instead of going to cheating a company that its products is as safe as many products in the market. People get sick in many ways and mostly are genetic. Breast cancer is an example and it cannot be blamed on a company that does many tests meticulously. After all, there FDA out there that does testing regularly without JNJ involved and FDA approves the products based on scientific facts not a layer that speaks from it bottom. Why patients go after FDA?"
should retest 120 as lawsuits pile up Not what some want to hear but FACTS
Patient hits lottery and wins 10 million after stroke.
best vaccine in the world
Next JNJ target is $165.
Join BNTX tomorrow and get your $$ back. You won’t have to worry about safety.. they just got approved to use the vaccine on teenagers.
I see a bunch of drama queens have crawled out from under the woodwork.
I’m sure there are more than 6 that’s the only number they reported.

"IBIO, BARDA built their lab for mass vaccine production. Do your D&D gonna be a big winner. J&J will use ibio's lab for mass vaccine production as their are both BARDA Members."
Why is JNJ down almost $2.00 today? I haven’t noticed any real new negative news today or yesterday? Is there a negative surprise coming later today?
folks isn't j&j giving away the vaccine basically for free? check out one of its suppliers who will be making the vaccine for profit e b s I think that's going to be the real winner here go for it I just bought some the other day.

J\J stock great news!! Big upward move Monday! Will absolutely have a positive affect On all travel . Jg
This doesn't seem right -- I suspect someone within the production group contaminated the vaccine. After all of the research they did an such a common method....this just doesn't seem right. Boolean
Easy $140 this week
I swear every time I buy something it drops.
"$JNJ posted improved earnings in 3Q16, helped by higher sales compared to 3Q15. Net earnings were $4.27Bil or $1.53 per diluted share compared to $3.36Bil or $1.20 per diluted share last year."

overpriced or cheap?
JNJ vaccine contains an adenovirus to be injected into human body. Where to find the safety data? What is FDA standard for GMO?

"Q1 2018 report Q1 2018 numbers exceeded expectation of investors but some analysts tried to spin negativity based on small matters while ignoring real matters.Lets review and analyze them: 1- Baby Care dropped in US. True but analysts made so much noise for a small matter. First, Baby Care was positive or flat overall YOY in spite of constant news and article about baby power. US sale dropped by a drop like $16mm but internationally gained $18mm. So, this is nothing to make noise for revenue of $20.1B for the quarter that exceeded by $600mm from the Q1 estimate. 2- Ramicade revenue went down by $283 mm YOY because of generic. First, Ramicade still producing as a blockbuster for JNJ but the company is replacing it with other drugs. J&J has a few other drugs in IMMUNOLOGY that compensated for Ramicade and more. Stelara gained $238 mm YOY, Simponi/Simponi Aria gained $90 MM YOY and finally other new drugs gained $66 mm YOY for total of $394 mm or $111 mm higher than last year Q1 in IMMUNOLOGY. Nobody expects Remicade to produce for good. A good company replace it and that is exactly what JNJ is doing. So, why analysts don't see this clear fact? 3- Zytiga may go generic in 2019. So what? JNJ has recently expanded its labels and that's why the revenue went up by 62% ($332 mm)YOY. These new labels cannot go generic and JNJ is the only one with right to sell. So, most of Zytiga rev comes from recent labels expansion that belong to JNJ only and generic cannot touch them for several years. After all, in ONCOLOGY, JNJ is making tones of new money. The sector gained over $717 mm YOY because of Darzalex and Imbruvica and Valcade. New Sector PULMONARY gained $587 mm YOY or new money. Vision Care added $317 mm new money. One must be blind to ignore all these progresses especially new drugs that have been approved or will be approved like ERLEADA."
"""Missouri judge affirms $4.69 billion talc verdict, J&J vows to appeal""And the beat goes on...."

"The talc lawsuits are total BS, concocted by ambulance chasing fear mongers. JNJ is one of the best companies on the planet and an excellent buy below $130. Its going to $150."
Sorry to speak the truth but no empirical evidence exists to link any talc product to cancer. Smart investors will be buying JNJ before sanity re-enters the room and the share price returns to the high 140's where it belongs.
FYI if interested in listening to day 3 of trial. Seems JNJ person on stand was trying to convince judge that JNJ was trying to educate doctors on opioids rather than trying to increase their sales. I don’t think anyone was convinced. She probably would have gained more credibility to be more honest and state they were trying to increase sales as all companies do but only if the opioid would improve the person’s pain. Hopefully JNJ’s team is smarter than they appeared today. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HCvIk6I4uQw

"Seeking Alpha today rate JNJ a buy, while MRNA and NVAX remain a sell. Expect a rise tomorrow and the next days"
JNJ has a name brand most people know and trust. Imo they purposely delayed the Covid roll out with FDA complicity. Buy tons of it.

"JNJ has been 144 two yrs ago when they had 10% less revenue.This price is cheap.An ultra solid, defensive stock with low beta, rarely a favorite of traders is perfect at the moment for some quick buck.It will be above 150 in less than 10 business day."
"For what it's worth. I know a doctor that was in an antibody test with the 2 sit vaccine. After the first shot, they were tested and had no antibodies. It wasn't until the 2nd shot that they developed the anti bodies. With that said, I still think that JNJ's vaccine will be extremely beneficial both in the US and all over the world. JMO"
Benefits of getting $JNJ shares over a cash BO.1. You get dividend paying shares2. You stll own the cancer killer (sp will just keep rising)3. You've made nice bank 4. You can ask for physical delivery of your stock certificates and roll them up and beat a shortie with it!

It seems to be stuck....why?
"Although on a lose, i am holding JNJ. but boy i was doped by the news. I have put a big chunk of my capital of JNJ. but hopefully things would change soon."
Short attack and this board is full of fear mongering short sellers. Great company - don’t let the shorters steal your money. This is old recycled allegations from years ago intended to help shorters make some money for Christmas and cover their losses for the year. Long and strong - consumer staples!

"Jennifer, for some weird reason, deletes some of its ""work"" shortly after posting and thus my reply disappears.It stated JNJ would open at 165+ Monday (in a since deleted post).I replied that I'd take the other side of the bet; IMO JNJ will not open @165+ or approx. 4.4% higher than today's close.I'd be more than happy to be wrong and eat my words, but I'm just being realistic."
"I believe in JNJ, just bought 1,000 shares at this bargain price. I am sad in the loss of life, but believe in what JNJ can do to save lives and support them! Best regards to all my fellow retirees and those work at JNJ. "
what's going on!!!!!
Sanofi just announced they are willing to help JNJ with vaccine production.........Hopefully that will give this stock a little pop
"J&J is a powerhouse and a great company,however I know longer feel comfortable holding it,and I've had it a long long time.I could be wrong but I'm going with my gut and sold all my shares... To many sharks after all their cash and they won't let up.I still feel the last ruling 9572 Mil) was very unfair and has a good chance of reversing the decision."
"When JNJ hyped their approval to distribute a one shot refrigerated vaccine, and a projection of $185 share in the next year, I purchase 1000 shares at $162. Today shares are $155.you do the math. Stock is #$%$ Thanks Mr. Biden!"
"Can someone explain the difference here....""The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated complete protection against COVID-related hospitalization and death, 28 days post-vaccination.""But the press release also said it is 85% effective against severe cases...isn't this a contradiction to the 100% protection statement above?"
There's a reason they call it a blockbuster drug!
gern is a buy
So I guess if JNJ missed and announced lower expectations people would be buying.
JNJ a standout in this biotech shakedown. Forward pe 15.2 with room to grow. Forward dividend yield about 2.85% if you factor in a 6% dividend increase coming up. Where will you put your money in this low interest environment if not in one or more of these bluechips?
I think I’m about to make a rookie mistake . Thinking of selling some shares of jnj to pay off shares I bought on margin. Then sell some of the jnj shares to buy shares of growth stocks that I’m down on to lower cost average. I don’t have much shares of jnj anyways and I’m 33 years old so I can always circle to jnj. Thoughts?
JNJ will go back up. It it dip more I buy more shares.
"JNJ did a very poor press release on the vaccine.Most people have no idea that it reported effect against hospitalizations at 100%100% , they probably should have lead with that. suits me fine. my 165 sold calls expired worthless and Monday JNJ will be pushing 170 again."
"JOHNSON AND JOHNSON GET OFF YOUR BUTTS AND MAKE A BRAND OXYCODONE 30MG 50MG 75MG AND 100MG BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO GET MONTHLY SCRIPTS OF 300 OR MORE TO LAST THROUGH THE MONTH TO GET TO THE NEXT MONTH WITHOUT RUNNING OUT AND DETOXING...WITH 50 AND 100MG MORE PURE BRAND OPTIONS DOCTORS WOULD NOT HAVE TO WRITE SO MANY.MNK STOCK IS GOING NUTS ON POSSIBLE OPIOID LITIGATION BECAUSE 45 YR OLDS AND UP STILL NEED THESE PILLS BUT THEIR IS PRICE GUAGING AND A SHORTAGE, 47 STATES READY TO SETTLE AND NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL IS FINALLY ON BOARD"
P/E RATIO REALLY DOESNT MATTER AFTER SEEING THIS STOCK. PEOPLE GONNA BUY WHATEVER THEY LIKE NO MATTER WHAT THE VALUATIONS LOOK LIKE.
"Hope this adenovirus produced antigens are the way to go. Since Covid is similiar to a cold, I would think so. More direct approach injecting this antigen to make your body produce its own immunity. The mRNA technology is nice...great 90% effective rates but it has been sped up so we don't know any long term affects, if any. If I had my choice, I think I would probably go for the JNJ technology."
I take back my negative remarks about Gorsky not paying attention to the growing our investment in the stock and congratulate him on the earnings beat. However he should sur Reuters fior everything they have for dishonest reporting. Freedom of the press is a wonderful thing. Many throughout our history have dies protecting it. But with that freedom comes a responsibility to be honest not lie and hide behind a freedom. If Gorsky won't sue Reuters maybe we shareholders could!
I muted walter white. Good riddance!
A steady trend that could take us to the upper 140s by year end. GLTAL
Remember JNJ is more than just a COVID-19 vaccine producer
The dividend still pays $4.04 per year every year. More after this years shareholders meeting. I think JNJ will do just fine.
"JNJ, it's a keeper, great company, great dividend, it's a long term hold. I can't wait to see come April whether they will increase the dividend from a low of .4 cents to a high of .6 cents bringing the dividend to.90 cents or taking it up a nickel to .89 cents a share. GLTA."

"Knock Offs Loom For J&J's Blockbuster — Why An Analyst Is Still BullishFacebookTwitterLinkedInShare LicensingALLISON GATLIN10/29/2018Two generic drugmakers can knock off Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) blockbuster cancer treatment, Zytiga, as soon as Wednesday. But one analyst remained bullish Monday on the Dow Jones stock.On Friday, a U.S. District Court invalidated a key patent protecting the Johnson & Johnson drug. Zytiga's patent was to expire in 2027. But the court invalidated the patent and ordered that generics wait until Wednesday to launch pending an injunction from J&J.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro says the ruling removes uncertainty for J&J stock.""While this is a negative outcome, it removes a key overhang and improves visibility on J&J's 2019 outlook,"" he said in a report to clients Monday.

1 in a million? Sell off is an over reaction!
"After dividend ex date, there is nothing in JNJ to be excited. After all, Zytiga went generic and insiders sold."
New 52 week high. So glad the biggest (by far) position I have owned for over 25 years has benn JNJ. Congradulations to all that refused buy into the fear.
IVOB has now trained 70 doctors from China on the InvoCell technique. It's about half the cost of traditional IVF. Production to China starts in June. Their Q2 is probably going to be amazing.
I have been a long term holder of JNJ but decided to sit it out for a while as a stock holder. Lots of issues out there.

https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/a-message-from-johnson-johnson-ceo-alex-gorsky-about-talc-safety
The current situation that Johnson and Johnson is in reminds me of the Tylenol scare years ago. Johnson and Johnson will get through this and investors will look back at this as just another point in which there was a buying opportunity to purchase stock at a cheaper price. In my opinion fair value on Johnson and Johnson would be 140.00.
What an incredible company. Enough said.
It's pretty sad when this board will not let you post the companies financials. You should take a close look at them.
Jnj is working on the next generation covid vaccines to fight the variant
You guys should know these legacy large cap stocks don’t go up a lot on good news
"J&J’s effort to protect its iconic Baby Powder franchise by shaping research was led by physician and scientist executives. An early 1970s study of 1,992 Italian talc miners shows how it worked: J&J commissioned and paid for the study, told the researchers the results it wanted, and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal.The effort entailed other attempts to influence research, including a U.S. government study of the health of talc workers in Vermont. J&J’s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary, one of several mine operators involved in the study, developed a relationship with the U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health researchers to “even influence the conclusions” through suggestions of “subjective interpretations,” according to a 1973 Windsor Minerals memo."
wake up people JNJ vaccine 85% effective against severe infection 100% effective against hospitalizations. all this with one shot.
Anyone think we are going to $160?
"Lmfao! I got tons of thumbs down from JNJ shorts when I said the vaccine would be back in action in no time. As usual I was right. So long shorts, bye Felicia."
"If you wait until AFTER a stock split to buy, all the dopes that are mistakenly waiting until after a stock split to buy will temporarily run up the stock for a short period of time. I guess if you like to buy high, fine with me."
Unfortunate that the jnj vaccine has been plague badly by the blood clot issue
JNJ + GERN..... cannonball splash coming in less than 15 trading days....got my popcorn ready

"The following is from ""Bloomberg Intelligence Watch: J&J Talc Suits""""2. Who's Favored""J&J.J&J is favored in talc lawsuits on the science, though bad documents and mixed verdicts could make settlements more likely. J&J ins't expected to change its poor trial record in Missouri, but a $4.7 billion judgment could be reversed based on jurisdiction, giving the company settlement leverage. Documents allegedly showing J&J learned of ""talc/ovary"" problems, trace asbestos in talc, and the fact that talc and asbestos share similar properties could hurt. Causation will still be hard to prove. (02/19/19)"""
Congrats to those who could pick up at today's lows. You will be happy.
"Yeah, going to close green and announce the phase 3 vaccine trial after hours, I figure..."
"this company has huge revenue and profit, why is it mostly flat throughout 2020?"
"jnj was/is going to sell the vaccine at no-profit price so from that perspective it doesn't change the overall profitability of the company. of course, if its vaccine becomes popular, it would add to jnj's goodwill/reputation in public perceptions.fortunately for me, I sold my jnj holdings at 68, which at first looked like a mistake but now i have chance to buy back at more favorable price."
Spam is insane
"Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) released results today from the phase 3 clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, saying that the data showed it was 66% effective against moderate disease, 85% effective against severe disease, and completely prevented hospitalization and death. If you read it in the opposite order and headline it in the opposite order, the stock maybe doesn’t drop?"
been in since 1969 $1...v happy
jnj took no money overseas too many law suits and they just started it will go to 110 by end on month
"Studies now show mouthwash and oral rinses (Listerine etc) can prevent covid-19? Guess stock up on Listerine now before there is a run on that. Not sure if that will help JNJ’s bottom line, but can’t hurt."
$JNJ needs to decide on $VXRT in Q2...perhaps this leaked.. also $AZN s failures will help the probability of Vaxart getting gov't funding and being included in the EUA. Most other countries still desperately need vaccines and an easy way to distribute so even if the US doesn't fund i'd be amazed if another country didn't step in soon...
If the current corporate tax passes reducing corporate taxes to 20% this could reflect in earnings for some stocks as much as four dollars a share on earnings. For Johnson and Johnson I have figured out yet the amount that it will increase earnings but there will be a substantial change in estimates for 2018 once this is passed. Already there has been an estimate that the Dow would go up next year by ten percent. Will see how this goes. I would be a buyer right now if one thought the tax package was going to pass.
"Call it dramatic irony. Speaking to his biopharma colleagues this week in San Francisco, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said the pharma industry needs to watch itself on pricing, but only days later, his own company rolled out dozens of price hikes.J&J boosted list prices Thursday on top-sellers such as Xarelto, Stelara and Zytiga, even though the latter drug recently fell off the patent cliff, according to Reuters. Most of its two dozen hikes fell in the 6% to 7% range, according to the news service. A J&J spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from FiercePharma."
"Have you no decency?Profit over lives, really? And you wonder why people think the system is broken?"

"Today's market action is very measured and panic free. There is a lot bargain hunting going on. I see it as much needed correction for the stock before making further strides.

"How effective will JNJ's vaccine be in addressing the variants? And to the extent a variant can't be addressed, how quickly can an updated vaccine be produced? How does this compare to the mRNA vaccines - there seems to be some consensus that the mRNA vaccines will have an advantage over JNJ???"
This dip is a gift for those who need to average down or just want to add more to your portfolio. Nothing has changed fundamentally that will affect them moving forward. Ignore the daily BS.
"Sell JNJ, buy Moderna"
Has anyone else heard the rumor that J&J is in talks to buy TransEnterix (TRXC) the robotic surgery company? TRXC is up over 100% in just the last few days.
"hold off on buying JNJ until after May 1st.. 2 for 1 stock split may be in the future. For the past 30 years anytime JNJ has cleared $100 a share, by the end of the second Qtr. ( when they DO split.) So with new tax bill signed and JNJ riding well over $100/ share and it's been a minute since last split, it is very possible a split will happen. keep your powder dry and buy after the split."
"Johnson & Johnson could have 'tens of millions' of COVID-19 doses by end of February, Gottlieb saysJan. 27, 2021 10:52 AM ETJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)By: Jonathan M Block, SA News Editor7 Comments* FDA grants emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for its COVID-19 vaccine, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tells CNBC the company could have ""doses in the low tens of millions"" available by the end of next month.* Gottlieb adds Johnson & Johnson could supply additional tens of millions of doses in March.* Gottlieb, who serves on the board of directors of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), said Pfizer has committed to providing 120M doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, developed with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), this quarter.* He added that Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is slated to provide 100M doses by the end of the quarter.* Johnson & Johnson CFO Joe Wolk yesterday said the company expects to release late-stage trial results of its COVID-19 vaccine next week."
If there is a silver lining the dividend gets issued out tomorrow. Dollar cost averaging.
"Significant POP from JNJ. The vaccine is 100% effective preventing death and hospitalization during the phase 3 trial, 44.000 people. The 1 dose vaccine will provide invaluable in the fight against the pandemic, with the two dose follow up likely to be long term successor, with out cold storage distribution challenges.... I see Pfizer, is already looking to increase the number of doses per vial due to logistical challenges...."
JNJ vaccine 72% effective with one shot in the US and can be stored in a regular refrigerator for 3 months. Logistically superior to the others.
Go ahead and dip. Divys being paid out soon. I’ll take the discount
Is today the last day to get in before the ex dividend? JNJ having a nice day so far. Would love to see a close above $133
"Not an investor here but I got this vaccine last Sunday. I had adverse effects nect day but recovered quickly as well and easily made to work most of the work week. The blood clot issue is extremely rare and I believe vaccine will be resumed with additional guidance, one shot is definitely working to its advantage."

"Hello all, A simple question- since J&J is already a huge company with so many products etc, a vaccine success may not raise its stock by much. So wouldn't it make more sense from an investment perspective to invest in the other top few companies in this race, such as Novavax, Moderna, or BioNTech/Pfizer? What are the pros and cons of each Thanks!"

"Update on Therapeutic and Diagnostic Programs Targeting TDP-43 $JNJ, $RHHBY, $AVXLLausanne, Switzerland, November 1, 2018 - AC Immune SA (ACIU), a Swiss-based, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases will provide updates on its product candidates at the Society for Neuroscience Meeting 2018, taking place in San Diego from November 3rd to 7th, 2018.The first update will cover the wholly-owned TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) antibody program aimed to provide novel therapeutic options for patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). The second update will be on the accompanying diagnostic program focused to deliver positron emission tomography (PET) tracers specific for misfolded and aggregated TDP-43, which is non-exclusively partnered with Biogen Inc.The oral presentation entitled ""Discovery and development of diagnostics and therapeutics for TDP-43 proteinopathies"" includes data on both programs and will be presented on November 4th during the session ""Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies"" (1pm to 3.15 pm, PST; Session #188, in room SDCC 5).AC Immune is developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against pathological forms of the transactive response (TAR) DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Misfolded TDP-43 has been identified as the major component of pathological protein inclusions, in both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). It has been shown that pathological TDP-43 can spread from neuron to neuron as being described for many pathological proteins in neurodegenerative disease. This mechanism creates the opportunity to interfere with the process through application of monoclonal antibodies. AC Immune is using its proprietary SupraAntigenTM technology to raise a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded TDP-43 which are currently undergoing functional evaluation. This program is wholly-owned by AC Immune.Complementary to a therapeutic approach, AC Immune is developing novel PET tracers specifically targeting pathological TDP-43 inclusions. Small molecules suitable for PET tracer development are being derived from AC Immune's proprietary MorphomerTM chemistry technology platform, which is designed to interact with misfolded and aggregated proteins. Promising small molecule hits have been identified by binding assays using patient -derived TDP-43 aggregates. The ability to precisely diagnose FTLD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies and therefore treat patients earlier and more accurately is critical to disease management that uses novel therapeutic approaches. This collaboration with Biogen Inc. was established in April 2016; it is non-exclusive, and AC Immune retains intellectual property and commercialization rights.About TDP-43TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein 43) is a new target in the area of neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolded, aggregated TDP-43 is found in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Huntington's disease. There is growing body of evidence that the pathological aggregation of TDP-43 protein also plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. The link of clinical features and spread of pathological TDP-43 is associated with a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and make misfolded TDP-43 a promising target for our antibody program.About TDP-43-PET tracers A brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain involving an imaging device and an imaging agent called a PET tracer. No TDP-43-PET tracer has received regulatory approval for commercial distribution, which represents an important medical need to diagnose precisely patients suffering from TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Once the TDP43-PET tracer is introduced to the body, it transiently enters the brain and binds to abnormal TDP-43 inclusions. Through the radiotracer on the tracer molecule, the imaging device detects the TDP-43 imaging agent and creates pictures reflecting the amount and distribution of misfolded TDP-43 in the brain.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ac-immune-present-2018-society-100115734.html?guccounter=1"
"Your attacks on JNJ are misplaced. Ya want to blame someone, blame the Chinese war machine for biological agents and our govt, the world, for doing nothing about it. This was an engineered virus in a Chinese lab that got away from them. A pandoras box of biological weaponry. The WHO knows this but wont act, even if they could prove it because they will lose china's money."
"JNJ was hot until 1Q18 ER. After that it was all downhill. Hopefully now that we are likely close to the bottom, we could see it trend up. The tax reform was a big positive. So was the nice dividend boost and the implied vote of confidence. But it has been weighed down by other negative factors like law suits, strengthening of the dollar etc. Pendulum will have to swing back sooner or later to the other side. Patience will win."

"large drop today. Media all talking about JNJ pushing drugs to the addicts to make money, that's all. Maybe true, scary!"
Same thing happened last January after the Actelion news. Stock dropped from 115 to 111. After that the stock never stopped going up until this ER. I think this is the beginning of another run up to 170-180 level. We have plugged all the gaps and are ready to go!

"The endpoints for MDGL versus GALT are totally different. MDGL endpoint required that they show reduction in fatty liver tissue which was met in their phase 2 trial. GALT had to show a much more difficult endpoint which was to show a significant change in hvpg which is a measurement of liver blood pressure, which was accomplished in patient without esophageal varices. MDGL will treat patients with early-stage Nash and GALT will treat patients with advanced Nash that has developed into cirrhosis of the liver, therefore they are not competitors. Since Nash has no symptoms until late stage development to cirrhosis of the liver, GALT drug will be more widely used then MDGL. In GALT trials it was proven that there was significant reduction in fibrosis. I believe that GALT could meet the endpoint that MDGL met but I don't believe that MDGL could meet the endpoint that GALT had. Therefore I believe GALT has the better drug. They both have to perform a phase 3 trial. Based on this data, GALT is way under valued."

Nice numbers and raised guidance.
"I wish everyone a wonderful festive holiday and good health, happiness, love and good fortune for the New Year."
The problem with todays investors is they want instant gratification - in this case they would prefer that JNJ used the 30B for stock repurchase instead of 15% increase in R and D. They don't look for the long term so they sold off.

Great long term holding. Long.
Knee-jerk reaction to efficacy comparison. Key is it protects 100% against hospitalizations. Cant beat the convenience of one shot refrigerator storability convenience. Should recover in short order. Besides vaccine is not meant to be money maker for JNJ.

This is a Word beater single shot vaccine with only cool storage required. Even Pfizer and Moderna are not 72% after 1st dose. They are only 52% and they were tested Worldwide. JNJ is proceeding with a 2 dose study as well

Let’s not forget the JNJ vaccine got a failing grade. Review of JNJ Bach as been scheduled for the 22nd why the LONG LONG delay?? We are not sure it even works given the TERRIBLE TERRIBLE results- short short short
"ALL these politicians should be locked up, using the public as guinea pigs. How on earth are they producing vaccines at such an alarming rate. Everyone and their grandmother is making a vaccine. Some of these conpanies have NEVER, EVER produced a vaccine prior to covid-19. And to make matters worse, from the onset of the outbreak its been about a year, and we have all these vaccines claiming to be ao effective. Usually it takes years to formulate and vette a new medicine, now they are able to do it in a matter of weeks/months.I would suggest we ask our politicians and their families to take rhe vaccines first and let us know how it worked out. So far tbey are all using the excuse that they don't want to jump the line, and that they are giving those in priorty situations the jab first. Note, first Pfizer then Moderna claimed they had a vaccine, one tried to one-up the other with ridiculous claims of efficacy, then , the other said, well ours is good for the south African strain, and the UK strain etc, etc.How can it be good for all strains when you do not know what yu are facing. And if that's the case, then they better get us a vaccine for the flu that actually works and while they are at it producing results so quickly they should get to work on some cure for cancer or atleast a vaccine, since they can solve these things in such short notice. We the public need to ask the right questions and stop being lead like sheeps to the slaughter. How can we trust any of the science when it has not been properly vetted.If this keeps up, I'm putting out my own vaccine!."
"What a reversal! Just under a week ago, all they wanted to do was to throw away the shares under 130! Now we may very well end the year in all time highs what with all the repatriated cash and the Actelion assets working their magic!"

Who was it that wrote that it was probably lab contamination a ways back?
I am up 280% on JNJ and collecting a sensible stream of dividends. JNJ is a great American company!
if the vaccine is the highest in protecting you from death (JNJ) then the “threat” is not getting the virus. The threat is dying from the virus.
JNJ certainly not trading like the end of the world is near with their Covid shot. They probably have a good idea whats going on since the cases seem to be confined to women with low platelet levels and of child bearing years. We may see a recommendation this demographic take one of the other available shots if the so choose.

"If a second JNJ booster shot a month later rises the resistance to the 95% Moderna and Pfizer share and JNJ charges the same amount for the 2 shot regimen, then this will still be a great ""shot in the arm"" for JNJ's financial bottom line. There are billions of people out there who are trying to get a vaccine and no where near the amount currently being produced to provide the vaccine to them. JNJ could still make Bank on this."

Two of the best small biotech and possible takeover companies are AVEO and GALT. Aveo drug Tivozanib received NICE positive opinion for first-line treatment of RCC. EU approved Tivozanib for advanced RCC in 2017. AVEO will complete Tivozanib phase 3 trial in 2 QT of 2018. Plus it's pipeline is worth billions. GALT completed its phase 2B trial for Nash liver cirrhosis and had positive clinical statistical results for patients without esophageal varices. It also has a pipeline worth billions of dollars.

"JNJ is one of those companies you build your portfolio around. This company is a staple in the market and often forgotten about because it's ""boring."" This isn't going to pop 5-10% in a trading day, but it will gradually grow and weather the worst of storms in time. Everyone freaking out over the vaccine not being 80%+ effective, but it shows that it reduces the risk of death. I feel like once the vaccine is rolled out with a proper distribution plan there will be a significant reduction in cases/deaths combined with the others. If you stick with JNJ, add shares when possible and look past the nonsense, you will be happy with your decision."
remember what is said...it the short-run the market is a voting machine but in the LONG RUN the market is a weighing machine (Benjamin Graham) so transitory news and emotions may influence the price but fundamentals and earnings like J&J have win out...
"I am thinking, what would be the impact of almost 10 percent shaving in the last few days right before ER? It's already down and relatively cheap. What about the trial. Is the judge going to decide this week?"
"Well, $8.10 income estimate was raised to $813 and $8.56 to $8.58. Retails should notice these changes."
JnJ has the chance to be a game changer. A 72% chance to be exact. Well not really exact because the efficacy rate is expected to be lower. Ha ha! Long live MRNA!
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IS NOT FAR AWAY TAKE IT TO THE BANK

the ruling is being spun as a win-- it is a disaster - ultimately they have to fight it all the way the the supreme court --otherwise they are heading for bankruptcy- they have no choice here
"Love the dip keep selling folks as I need to spend my $25,000 and I keep buying on these dips. THANK YOU! I buy when others panic and there is PANIC."
"Been buying on every dip caused by a lawsuit. JNJ survived the Tylenol Murders, these lawsuits are nothing compared to that. This company will still be around 100 years from now. These lawsuits are not a threat to the company's future."
"will split 3-1 to make a buy market, good luck everybody god bless"
"Seems like an absolute no brainer to load up at these levels. Ridiculous pull back on news that you have a 1 in a million chance of getting a blood clot. You have a higher chance of being struck by lightning.Maybe more prudent would be to load up a bit and wait for any further pull backs (but I don't see this happening, because big money isn't dumb, they won't be pulling their money out due to this news)."
JNJ shared that they expect an impact on the skin products. this just changed my outlook. this stock has more to go down.
"Sell, Sell, Sell"
If the package warns of.the risk - how can jnj be responsible?
JNJ is one of the best American companies. JNJ is a great buy and hold stock.

"@cosmicdust, I bought in at$62.62 in 2010$131.10 at the moment.I've had years of dividend and drip.These are the statistics that turn me on."
Back to $150 by tomorrow
Not sure on next step - great Q2 results yet stock cannot hold on to the gains - back to flat already vs last Friday close. DIV yield is not enough to hold this stock - looking for stock price increase as well given continuing strong results - may have to look elsewhere
Double bottom breakout possibly?
I'm back to >100% up in JNJ price- original buys plus reinvested divs over the years... not too shabby.
Less than 0.5 Million !!! Thats it folks see you at $140 in the next week.
So... vaccines were never a profitable revenue stream  Blood clots or no blood clots... $160 re-entry
"The “pause “ has gone on long enough. No, I am not a doctor, but I have common sense."
JNJ is selling off assets and ending collaborations across the board to raise and preserve cash. things must not look too good for them on the near future. looks like they are preparing for major lawsuit payments going forward.
JNJ is only going to get stronger after all these bankruptcies wipe out 80% of the drug manufacturers / distributers.
over due to bust out
A huge fund just liquidated....massive drop
I am still disappointed in management as I bought the stock on their extremely positive pre-release discussion on the vaccine and then it is not what we thought... I don't like being misled....
"Asbestos was legal at one point and used in all products up through the 80's. Buy now, Smile later!!"
66%?!?!? Sounds like Russian Roullette. I'm sticking with the PFE vaccine.
"Add JNJ for $142, it's ex-dividend next Monday. Consider how volatile the whole stock market lately, uncertainty created by drug loss patent is a lot easier to stomach than that of the geopolitical, trade and rising interest rate issues. Good luck longs."
Price to earnings at 233! Needs to come down to <30. Good luck will be at <$70 soon
Is this J&J particulate (baby powder or any other airborn talc product) guaranteed to be “100% asbestos free”?
Don’t overlook the fact that JNJ vaccine is easy to transport to remote areas. Worldwide it will be a game changer
"JNJ is a MAJOR component of mutual funds and ETF's, all of which are experiencing redemptions. If you are not a mutual fund, forced to sell, you have a pretty good oppurtunity here."
Appears JNJ will soon be making money off of Imetelstat in Europe. They are hiring a pricing specialist now.
We are moving forward for better.
@steve & @Salmon are one in the same troll. You would be better off picking another stock to try and demonize. JNJ's not the one. Too strong and solid. It has it's moments of weakness but at the end of the day JNJ is a life long hold for most.
"Over 6 million people received the JNJ shot, 6 had a negative reaction. Pausing the vaccine distribution is doing more harm than good. Yes I feel for the 6 that had a reaction, and 1 died. Nobody wants that. But over 6 million have benefited from the vaccine and are back to their ""normal"" lives. You have to weigh the pros and cons. If someone is allergic to peanut butter, you don't stop producing and selling peanut butter."
technical is deteriorating.
Buy NOW!!!!!!
"MODERNA is UP 7% on marginal demand shifting away from JNJ. When this JNJ news really hits all areas of the U.S., you'll see the cascade down."
See the harm fake lawsuits over talc did?
I will never have something thats not at least 95 percent effective or higher injected into my body. Thats like playing Russian Rulett.
"JnJ have so many lawsuits pending,is it time to bail out..it seems every lawyer around is after them,for such a quality company it's a shame..."
Safety factor of JNJ will propel upward good move watch and learn
"looks like JNJ should set aside 50 or a 100 billion to take care of this January 22, 2019 Written by: Austin Kirk Add Your CommentsCONTACT A LAWYERHave A Potential Case Reviewed By An AttorneyFIRST NAMELAST NAMEPRIMARY PHONEALTERNATE PHONEEMAIL ADDRESSDETAILS ABOUT CASEJohnson & Johnson now faces talcum powder lawsuits brought by more than 10,000 different individuals in the federal court system, where complaints over the risk of cancer from Baby Powder or Shower-to-Shower products are all centralized before one judge for coordinated pretrial proceedings.Each of the Baby Powder lawsuits and Shower-to-Shower lawsuits raise similar allegations, claiming that Johnson & Johnson has failed to warn consumers for decades about the serious health risks associated with their talc-based product, which have been linked to the development of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.Given similar questions of fact and law raised in complaints filed through the federal court system, the cases are all consolidated for pretrial proceedings as part of a multidistrict litigation (MDL), which is centralized before U.S. District Judge Freda L. Wolfson in the District of New Jersey.In a joint status report (PDF) submitted today, in advance of a conference on January 24, the parties report that the MDL now includes claims filed by a total of 10,023 plaintiffs nationwide. In addition, more than 2,000 additional claims are pending in various state court systems, including California, Missouri, Delaware, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Arizona and Pennsylvania.While Judge Wilson is expected to determine the admissibility of general causation expert witness testimony this summer, over whether plaintiffs have sufficiently reliable evidence about the link between talcum powder and cancer to proceed to trial in the federal court system, a number of state court cases have already gone before juries nationwide in recent years, with a number resulting in multi-million dollar verdicts against Johnson & Johnson for failing to disclose the known risks associated with their products.The largest verdict occurred in July, when a St. Louis jury awarded 22 women $4.7 billion, including punitive damages designed to punish Johnson & Johnson. In addition, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $25.7 million in May 2018, and a New Jersey jury awarded $117 million to a man diagnosed with mesothelioma due to exposure from talcum powder.At least one additional trial is currently underway in California, and a multi-plaintiff claim involving 13 different women diagnosed with ovarian cancer is expected to begin in St. Louis next month. Another trial involving claims for 24 different women is set to begin in April 2019, with third multi-plaintiff case expected to begin in August 2019.Although Johnson & Johnson has maintained that it will continue to defend the safety of their products at trial, and is pursuing appeals in each of the prior cases that resulted in damage awards, the company will face increasing pressure to negotiate talcum powder settlements to avoid a steady stream of trials in the coming months and years.Some analysts have suggested that the recent verdicts are a sign that juries find Johnson & Johnson’s trial defense lacking in credibility, and the company could face substantially greater liability and uncertainty with thousands of cases going before juries if they fail to establish a global settlement program in the future."

Like I told my wife many times. If JNJ was $200 per share I wouldn't sell it. We are retired and the JNJ dividend is part of our passive income retirement strategy. What we changed is that we no longer reinvest the dividend after over 25+ years of reinvesting the dividend. We just take the proceeds in cash.

"I love reading this from JNJ. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said on Tuesday it plans to begin imminent production of its trial COVID-19 vaccine on an “at risk” basis, as the coronavirus pandemic infects nearly 2 million people around the world.Manufacturing “at risk” allows the world’s third largest pharmaceutical company to produce a product before its ultimate design is finalized and released to the public. The company plans to produce its COVID-19 vaccine in the Netherlands, and a facility it is updating in the United States.“We're manufacturing at risk to ensure that should the clinical development and the trials be successful, we are in a position to kind of flip the switch and ready to go, to create great access across the globe,” J&J CFO Joe Wolk told Yahoo Finance in an interview.J&J began developing its vaccine for COVID-19 in early January with its European subsidiary Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. It’s using the same biological platform Janssen uses in developmental vaccines for Ebola, Zika and Influenza.During J&J’s first quarter earnings call, Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said the company is also negotiating with partners in Europe and Asia to produce the vaccine, and partnerships will be announced in the coming weeks.“Our goal is to enable the supply of more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally,” Stoffels said.Vaccine eyes early 2021 rollout"
Diversifying? Bored with pharmaceuticals? I am too!Inseego one of the best work and school from home companies seeing big demand for their products. INSG it's a 5g stock.
This is federal responsibility to step in and say look we approved these drugs and label and labeling is for this purpose. Go after doctors who are busy collecting money and don't care about patients.
121-122 is a good buying point!!

"Rather than an increased dividend, I'd rather see another stock split. at the 150 range, jnj is too pricey. This would be a good stock for grandparents to buy their grandchildren to teach them about investing but too high at the 150 range. And, yes, Gorsky is still a walking clusterfrack!"
Can anyone who actually knows something please give us an approximate estimate how much this stock will go up with emergency approval! Thanks so much!! ( I'm currently holding 1300 of JNJ and looking for some guidance.)
The stock could have done a little better for the investors even though the government will pull the strings with the vaccines value.
Belgium continues vaccinations.
Bad news for JnJ. AZN uses same technology as a JnJ & AZN just announced 70% efficacy. Hurry up and get on the BNTX train before it goes!
"As you know French and German authorities not recommended $AZN Covid-19 vaccine for the adults over 65 and $JNJ results was only 66% effective in preventing Covid-19 globally. $MRNA has better picture of manufacturing capabilities compared to JNJ and AZN. You also know NVAX still in the process of getting approval and so on but it is not clear when it can start to distribute and/or still effective on South Africa variant or any future variants is questionable?, so almost all vaccines are facing with big problems, but very far from the $MRNA. Therefore we are having a piece of gold in your hand keep it real."
Great company. I don't own as many shares as I used to but you can't go wrong putting this in the account.
Truthfully JNJ are finished in the vaccination program. No one would trust their vaccine now. JNJ's strength is in other areas.
I bought under $129 the other day. Way too cheap at that level with dividend increase coming soon. JNJ is a must own in the pharma category. You get the benefit of med devices and consumer products as well
This stock is probably a BUYING opportunity now. He has drastically bounced off its low this morning. The CEO will be on CRAMER'S show this evening. The company has sent out a rebuttal regarding all the negative news. On any weakness this stock should be bought. I have NO position in this company but will keep it on my 'radar' screen to buy the stock.
Nailed it for anyone that saw my posts.Almost immediately buying after hours.
"Four days ago I wrote: ""CDC reports adverse reactions to JNJ vaccine in four U.S. States. Monday, JNJ will begin the fall into the abyss."" The start of JNJ's DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY has begun. SUB-150 is coming. Confirmational bias in regards to messaging, sentiment and secrecy by JNJ will damage the stock going forward. 170 p/s this year? Ain't gone happen. 150 or lower p/s? You can bet on it."
JNJ is appealing the jury decision on the baby powder trial. If JNJ is successful in their appeal of the verdict this stock will move to $180 VERY quickly.
not buying any product that supports kidnapper Trump
I don't want JNJ vaccine @72% effacy when Moderna and Pfizer are 95.
I just finished reading the opinion and it appears the judge took the side of the state with respect to most of the evidence it presented but only awarded $570 million (per number provided by the state) for year one and said the state failed to provide adequate evidence of costs beyond that.
JNJ has a list of law suits against them as long as football field. From baby powder to drugs to devices and always seems to come through. They are so big and diverse something like Oklahoma is really nothing. This is a buying opportunity if you believe in healthcare stocks.
"The increasing trend towards healthier lifestyle choices, in all age groups in N. America where the highest pharmaceuticals use is globally, inc. people exercising more, counting their steps with their fitbit bands, eating more fruits and vegs, and less saturated fat but more healthy fats such as omega threes found in flax, fish and other sources, ect..All means. there will increasingly be less demand for pharmaceuticals as people are healthier which JNJ is placing much of their revenue growth hopes on. I myself lowered my bad cholesterol the LDL to 1.90 from 2.90 by simply making healthier dietary choices inc.eating no deep fried foods or meat all which increase arterial plaque, and exercise regularly. Therefore I did not need any pharmaceuticals my blood pressure and cholesterol normalized on their own. All stats I have looked at via consumer trends re: health care indicate people are increasingly choosing healthier lifestyle choices and focusing on prevention."
I’ll wait fir NOVAVAX with 96% efficacy and the only company that can quickly come up with boosters for the mutations..... TheThe ONLY vaccine that is 60% effective against the South Africa variant. Fact.. not Fiction! Thank you very much. Just saying.
JNJ has 14 billion profits each year. So it has to pay its 5-years total profits as punishment. JnJ stock will plunge to $40-$50 or lower
JNJ is the best stock to own long term... they serve and make great products from cradle to grave.
JNJONE SHOTeasy transportation.............................just as effective preventing death.
"Sightbox shut down. Yet another failed acquisition by JnJ. Sure acquisitions are always risky, but JnJ batting average is embarrassingly low, and NO ONE is ever held accountable. SB was essentially a warehouse distribution process for JnJ. Is that JnJs business model? Of course not. But high ups make their mark with acquisitions IF they go well. That they are never held accountable when they go wrong means they’re willing to spend shareholder money foolishly."
Don’t take the vaccine. I read small g 5 will be in this shot
JNJ has a number of links regarding information on Talc. You would be surprised how many current products you use everyday that contain Talc. It is one of the softest products in the world and for that reason it has been used in many products. Don't you think the FDA would have taken JNJ Baby Powder of the shelves in thousands of retail outlets by now if they felt the product was truly harmful. Back a few years ago you couldn't find JNJ Tylenol products anywhere due to concern about their manufacuting processes in a number of JNJ factories. JNJ had to shut down several factories and revamp the entire manufacturing process. This tooks months. The FDA was all over JNJ during that time. If the talc used in their baby powder was so harmful the FDA would have done something by now. There have never been any requirements to put warning labels on these products. JNJ has concrete evidence and science saying that the talc they use is not harmful. Baby powder contributes about .5% of JNJ's $70B + revenue. I don't think JNJ would continue the product if they thought it would harmful to babies and the general population. It's just not worth the risk. At the end of the day this is a classic example of the press stating something to harm the reputation of a great company. JNJ will do whatever it takes to defend itself and it's reputation. GL to all the longs. This too shall pass.
JNJ day after day under performing the market - why? Same price now as Nov 2018!! Truly terrible stock price performance
"Where are the people bragging about the dividends? please help me with the math, did it make sense to hold on to the stock instead of taking some profits out? oh wait the dividends payout.this is heading lower, way lower. not at buying opportunity until it gets to 2018 levels and/or it resolves legal issues."
this needs a close around 133
"The ONE dose vaccine will be the most used Worldwide because it is 60 to 70% effective, just needs a cool pack, and keeps everybody out of the hospital as the virus disappears. The TWO results are not in yet but may even be 98% effective as the antibodies continue to build."
6.8 million vaccines and 6 blood clot cases. One fatal out of nearly 7 million. That seems like a pretty good vaccine to me.
Frivolous lawsuits - an American specialty.
Is this board ever going to split the stock or we're going to be in a trading range for another year?
"JNJ vaccine news will not matter to JNJ stock. But yes, it is a nice to have. And it is only a pause and not a clinical hold. But this news also highlights the challenges of trying to fast-track vaccine candidates."
"One day we will all look back at this ... and say, ""Can you believe JNJ was 110?"". (wink)"
"ron,welcome back. You've been away for two months so obviously you're feeling better. Tell me please, were you a voluntary admission or were you sectioned ?"

"BTW for all the ""hair on fire"" JNJ doubters the Pharma industry has always been heavily litigated. It sort of comes with the territory. So the lawsuits although headline grabbing is nothing new to JNJ and the industry as a whole. It certainly doesn't impact sales as we have just seen in Q3. They are still selling JNJ baby powder everyday, and the antipsychotic drug Risperdal is consider by the world health organization as a preferred drug in the field. So all the ambulance chasers can keep chasing their tails. GL to all JNJ longs."
"Without Baby Powder, JNJ would decline. Late cycle stocks are about to go down. If Fed does not raise interest rate, that means something is wrong with economy. Then, Greenspan is correct. If Fed continues policy, the stocks will decline. Either way, stocks will suffer."

"JNJ is a Great Short. 52 week Low coming soon. There are a group of attorneys representing 12 states currently and more to follow and 100s of thousands of people who were addicted to oxycodone and oxycontin. In their lawsuit, they will show how JNJ played a roll although not as large as say Purdue Pharma in the opioid crisis. JNJ has settled with one state and better settle with the others quickly because if they do not, expect this company to fall under 100 before the end of the year."

Any hope for JNJ? Jnj started the month in the mid $150’s and as we close the month we are approaching the low $140’s. The stock is currently at a one month low of $143.05 and down 8 percent for the month of May. So basically this month you are down 3 years of dividends. Is JNJ a buy at these levels or that is need to go further down to the high $130’s? I was fortunate to get out between $149.30 and $149.80. I keep looking at the stock but it seems it can not find a bottom. Any thoughts?

I think JNJ vaccine has a good chance and a lot of opportunities in the USA and all over the world.This is the only vaccine with the easiest way to go far in remote areas and save people's life.
"Yesterday we saw a kneejerk reaction to pharmacies pulling talc off shelves causing stock price to dive. Crazy! This is a tiny product for JnJ. It doesn’t make to same profit margin as other products, and even before the litigation, it wasn’t growing like the rest of JnJ. It is dilutive in every way. JnJ should have sold off the brand 10 years ago. Only good news is that the options Sandy Peterson was loaded up with aren’t worth much...they always said these were merit based, so it seems right."
JJ needs to get moving on Gerons Imetelstat make lots of mula.
Last chance.

It's called big pharma and the crime bosses paying off the entire judicial sytem back in the day have nothing remotely close to an arsenal like big pharma. Very few could hold a candle to big pharma. Let's see what goes on tomorrow with the price's amount of direction. If the street knows what's up, they're going to buy up the weak money getting shaken out by next week if not tomorrow. JnJ will continue to rally into earnings though and a great report will supercharge them as long as they don't peak too soon before that."

"Look at the wider markets, almost all tge vaccine stocks are in the red. I'll hold my position still."
"The NIH research consisted of two parts. The first part began in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses, and had a budget of $3.7 million. The program funded Shi Zheng-Li, a virologist at the Wuhan lab, and other researchers to investigate and catalogue bat coronaviruses in the wild. This part of the project was completed in 2019.A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. The project was run by EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit research group, under the direction of President Peter Daszak, an expert on disease ecology. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th, Politico reported. Daszak did not immediately respond to Newsweek requests for comment."
Another JNJ earnings beat is likely. This stock is a keeper.
"Deaths in the U.S. from the flu in 2018 was 80,000. Deaths so far in 2020 is 10,000. Hmmmmm? Why no businesses closed in 2018. Strange."
Keep in mind the J&J vaccine was tested in both the UK and South Africa. The other vaccines were not! 85 % effective against serious illness or death. I’ll take vaccine that was more widely tested with great results! J&J vaccine!
Headed to 80. No doubt
"Once the $JNJ lawsuit noise settles down, they buy $GERN"
"so serious adverse effects for the adenovirus based vaccine like $jnj and $mrna. it will be intersting to see if jnj vaccine also had transverse myelitis . in this case there would be a direct correlation. so now we have messenger RNA based vaccines like $mrna and $pfe ( $bntx ) still in the running and us, $nvax. I know for a fact that mrna based vaccines are going to be much more expensive just based in transportation since their require frigid conditions to be stored. so with that being said, hows everyone doing :)"
and its now RED. Geeze!
"I agree that GERN is an attractive stock. JNJ is well-positioned. Do your homework and decide for yourself. Beware, GERN is easily manipulated. Do your own DD, and I feel confident that you'll find this opportunity of interest. GERN is way undervalued."
66% percent - not a risk i want to take - I wait for the better stuff and continue to stay home
"Every once in a while, I think about ditching JNJ because I might get better returns elsewhere. And every single time JNJ saves my portfolio in the downturn, and I'm not even talking about dividends."
i don’t believe cdc and the fake media. i don’t own JJ. i think Pfizer made a deal with the devil. hold back the vaccine news until immediately after election and we will make sure your vaccine tech is the main product. I believe JJ vaccine was free but pfizer is charging full price... ￼
"Minting moneyPosted by D4L | Saturday, May 26, 2018 | ArticleLinks | 0 comments » Not all dividend-paying companies make a lot of money, but the ones that do could fetch you solid returns in the long run, simply because a steady flow of cash doesn't just support a dividend but allows a company to grow dividends steadily, year after year. Owning dividend stocks backed by solidly growing cash flows can make you rich. Here are three you might want to consider... In fact, top dividend-paying companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and 3M (NYSE:MMM) have consistently converted 15% or more of their revenues into free cash flows (FCF). Combined, the three companies generated nearly $173 billion in revenues in 2017. That's a lot of money, and a good chunk of it is going into shareholders' pockets. That's why these money-minting dividend stocks deserve your attention."
"I’m going to give this room free vaccine info, because I see so many posts that are completely incorrect. JNJ IS NOT the only single shot effective vaccine. Wrong. The newest figures for Pfizer & Moderna is they are both 80% on a single dose and in 2 dose 95% effective."

Stay above $160 hopefully
IS it better to get a vaccine out there quickly that is proven effective and save the lives of hundreds of thousands and maybe lose 1 to a reaction? Get a grip. .
"JNJ is the safest! 04/29/21EU Vaccine Injury Reporting System Shows More Than 330,000 Adverse Events Following COVID VaccinesHealth Impact News compiled the latest data on reports of COVID vaccine injuries and deaths in EU countries following vaccination with all four COVID vaccines approved in the EU for emergency use.According to the report, injury and death report totals for each vaccine were:Pfizer-BioNTech: 4,293 deaths and 144,607 injuriesModerna: 2,094 deaths and 15,979 injuriesAstraZeneca: 1,360 deaths and 169,386 injuriesJohnson & Johnson (Janssen): 19 deaths and 246 injuriesRead more at The.

"Read article that Jim Cramer says wait to buy. I have held on to this stock for over 20 year. I don't wait for any to tell me when I should buy a good solid company like JNJ, PG or any other such companies. Over time these solid companies will make you money just not as fast as the FANG or some tech companies."
I cant possibly think of JNJ revenues getting affected due to coronavirus. If anything many of JNJ’s consumer health care products and some pharmaceuticals will be in hot demand. It is possible some of the elective surgeries like hip and knee replacement etc could get postponed and as a result JNJ device sales could get mildly affected. Net net it should be a moderate positive. This is the stock to be in in this environment with its guaranteed growing dividend that far exceeds money market rates along with strong capital appreciation potential from these rock bottom levels.

DOJ and SEC will discover that J&J is right and that the only threat to anyones health is the unethical action of selfish Mass Tort Lawyers!!!!
two new cases of blood clots after J&J vaccine investigated. blah blah. why weren't all those cases after Pfizer's vaccine investigated?
how will medicare for all affect jnj if a dem wins in 2020?
"What's wrong with JNJ? Market is at all time high and JNJ keep dropping. The worst thing is that the JNJ management is hiding and not even one word about anything. In spite of bragging that what did this and that, JNJ is behind in making any vaccine. PFE was not in the game when JNJ started its Covid vaccine and now ahead of the game."
more than one % after hours
Never base buying or selling on what you find here.
News media has ignored the JNJ vaccine so far but next week will be different.
I guess opioid drugs which can cause some level of addiction may be subject to lawsuits and legal liability now? America you better get use to sucking up some pain because the courts seem to know what’s better for you than your doctor. Millions of Americans will need to buy their drugs from other countries without FDA inspection. That is a risk that will be very hard to mitigate/avoid. We’re going to create a bigger problem for sure.
"Question. Where is J&J going to produce the vaccine, when (starting real deliveries, not to EMA or to their lab) and in which quantity per month. Worldwide."
100% affective against hospitalizations and death. No one else can say that￼. Period.
"17:04 [JNJ] One-shot COVID vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is reportedly safe and generates promising immune response in early trial of 805 volunteers; Phase I and II study shows one shot COVID vaccine determined safe and gives antibodies, according to exec - CNBC - Most of the study volunteers produced detectable neutralizing antibodies - By day 57, all volunteers had detectable antibodies, regardless of vaccine dose or age group, and remained stable for at least 71 days in the 18-to-55 age group. - The trial tested 805 volunteers. The company is expected to release results from its 45,000-person phase three trial later this month. - Company plans to ship the vaccine at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, which is about 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit."

It's not surprising that Reuters has not reported jnj's latest talcum powder lawsuit win reported by the press yesterday 2nd August 2019.The most important take is that this is the 6th win by jnj this year .

"Between the healthcare sector being beaten down by political rhetoric, and JNJ’s own litigation issues, it’s been a long year. If either of those two issues abate we could easily see a 15-20% gain in 2020."
"green now, but it will go down tomorrow."
A one shot thing is usually sought after. This corporation isn't going to be overly altered by a COVID vaccine. There's so much more to offer from JnJ.
2 more weeks jnj will change the vaccine world over.
"JNJ's one-shot vaccine with simple storage and easy distribution is a worldwide gamechanger. There is a 2-shot (or one shot & a booster) in the wings. JNJ has applied for emergency use. The vaccine is ready for distribution now in very large amounts. All preliminary data looks great, and approval will likely be before March 1."
"If you truly believe SENSEONIC is going to revolutionize CGM technology in a few years, then hold for long term. It is high risk, but very high reward stock. It could easily 30X from here, don’t pay attention to constant gyrations in the market. I always get inspiration from this Biomedical scientist who has been long term holder of Senseonic. If anyone would knows about CGM technology, it would be Biomedical scientist. He is also Founder and CEO or FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond.“"

Much needed correction over the past week to get rid of weak hands. Back to 52 week high and beyond 2nd half of year.

The other two require a first shot and then, a month later, a booster shot.""With a potent vaccine in a single dose,"" said J&J science chief Paul Stoffels, ""That means after two weeks, you could be protected."

sell off happening something is up
Is this still JNJ board or has it been taken over by GERNers?
Market is overreacting. Governments are still ordering the vaccine and JNJ is still making money. Buy the dip.
peanuts. and jnj will appeal.
THANKS TO J&J and last Admin.
Just because the CEO says something that doesn't mean it's so what do you think the report that came out that crashed this stock is because they said they were lying and they knew about it
Wish I had bought JNJ 20 years ago!!!! Now I have been buying each month and reinvest dividend !!!! Just a small investor.
J&J issues may not be the vaccine. It may be incorrect intravenous injection instead of intramuscular. We really need clear guidance.

"Cancer news...Lawyers had been soliciting on TV for I'd guess 6 months, then stopped a month or so agoSo this can't truly be ""news"" to anyone owning JNJ including me.Lawyers aren't ""advocates"", they are money hounds. And they see JNJ as having deep pockets.If another case or two is won and not appealed the TV commercials will start again.BTW similar thing going on with Roundup weed killer now. ONE person won a big settlement and the Lawyers are on TV not looking for people they ""care about"" but folks to make a percentage on.Lawyers - well I have many thoughts on them, none really flattering. But it's OUR system.If you pay attention you can make money on these situations.And at this time of Year with tax loss selling and the market, Tarif's, etc. it will cause JNJ to move with a higher Beta than normal downward.I'd love to pickup more JNJ but price is still way above all of my cost basis's.I still may buy some JNJ or calls for first quarter of next Year depending on how bad the premium is. And if the premium is high I may buy/write to lock in some decent return on those shares. After all if JNJ goes up significantly I'll benefit with all the shares that I currently hold.Tricky market.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!"
Wells Fargo reiterates $ 160
If people do not see these dips as buying opportunities you might want to get out of the investment game. Do you own due diligence. JNJ will be back over $130.00 this coming week.
"Upside down head and shoulders has been formed, you already know I bought some today"
"This is a definite FDA Approval. 72% efficacy. One dose, sustain at normal temp and US need more vaccines. Lot of shortage and recovery rate is good and fight against all variants"
"JNJ will have a ton of cash now to pursue more deals, buy back shares and increase dividends at a faster rate. Earnings momentum will continue. Imo, we could even see 200+ during next year."
JNJ HAS A GREAT CHART DO NOT SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Back to 140 please?
"JNJ is down almost -5% in a month on its vaccine news. FACT! Not my opinion. Nobody wants a vaccine that’s 66% efficacy when you can get multiple vaccines that are 95% + I keep reading posts in single shot and storage. You all should educate yourself bout all the other vaccines. Single shots as well just higher efficacy with two, except for JNJ. Other vaccines can be stored in a regular refrigerator for 30 days and hospitals use them up faster than that. EU, Scandinavian counties are banning the JNJ vaccine along with the the Mayor of Detroit. All equals JNJ price will continue to fall while others keep skyrocketing. If you were to educate yourself on other vaccines plus US already bought enough vaccine from Moderna & Pfizer. Sell this junk "

"This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (October 15, 2019).Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ), facing lawsuits from more than 100,000 plaintiffs over its product safety and marketing tactics, has taken the aggressive strategy of battling many of the cases in court.And it is losing. A lot.Juries and judges have ordered the health-products giant to pay billions of dollars in several recent trials over claims that J&J's signature baby powder and certain drugs and medical devices injured people, and that its marketing practices fueled the opioid-addiction epidemic.The latest: A Philadelphia jury awarded $8 billion in punitive damages last week to a man claiming his use of J&J's antipsychotic Risperdal when he was a boy caused abnormal breast enlargement. J&J has said it properly disclosed the drug's risks and benefits, and plans to appeal the verdict.In August, an Oklahoma judge ordered J&J to pay $572 million to the state for contributing to the opioid-addiction crisis, a judgment the company is appealing. Last year, a St. Louis jury found that J&J should pay $4.7 billion to 22 women and their families who alleged the company's baby powder caused ovarian cancer. J&J has said the talcum powder is safe and doesn't cause cancer; the company is appealing the decision.The New Brunswick, N.J., company faced lawsuits from at least 103,300 people or entities in U.S. courts at the middle of this year, up from the 8,580 plaintiffs pending in October 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal review of J&J's securities filings.J&J discloses the number of plaintiffs for the most significant of its product-liability cases in its filings.The number of talc-lawsuit plaintiffs surged to 15,500 as of June 30, from 1,400 in early 2016, the Journal analysis found. Plaintiffs in personal-injury lawsuits over J&J's pelvic mesh devices for women have declined from a peak of more than 55,000 pending in 2017 but still number about 24,800.J&J is challenging many of the lawsuits, rather than quickly settling, according to lawyers on both sides. ""Their natural reflex is to fight and delay, drag it out as long as they can,"" said Andy Birchfield, an attorney with Beasley Allen in Montgomery, Ala., who has sued J&J over baby powder and other products.The Risperdal damages and some other awards are likely to be reduced by judges, and possibly overturned, on appeal. Yet the losses signal J&J may ultimately have to pay a costly sum to resolve the lawsuits. The opioid litigation alone could cost J&J $5 billion to $10 billion to settle, Wells Fargo analysts have estimated"
bought on the open today! $$$
Oversold! IMHO. JNJ received subpoenas from the Department of Justice regarding this back in February. They have been working with the Department of Justice since then. It is hard to imagine a Fortune 500 company would market talc without testing it.

"$PULM their pulmonary technology is what we need ASAP.

This is why technology like this is so paramount.Our innovative particle engineering technology creates dry powder, which solves limitations of conventional inhaled technologies and expands the universe of inhalable drug therapies.iSPERSE is a proprietary technology that allows a broad range of drugs to be formulated as small, dense, and dispersible particles for highly efficient drug delivery and deep penetration into the lungs.iSPERSE can efficiently deliver small molecules, drug combinations, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids via the respiratory system for the treatment of both respiratory and non-respiratory diseases.Market cap is 20 Million Look for a break of 52 week high $3.01 market cap is only around 25M$ in spite two major deals already inked with Cipla and $JNJ. http://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_pulmatrix/201/Pulmatrix%20-%20Corporate%20Presentation%20March%202020.pdf"
"The following says it all. More negative than you expect but that's reality of JNJ.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has certainly had easier times in terms of appeasing the market. The time-tested stalwart of many portfolios has had a bit of stagnation, and higher costs due in large part to legal costs related to lawsuits over its talc powder. The company also spent roughly $400 million in settlements related to Xarelto, a blood thinner. The problems created a quarter with decreases in earnings, but the company also had flat revenues.JNJ reported sales of $20.02 billion. Compared to 2018's $20.01 billion, it marks a 0.1% increase year over year. That's not exactly robust growth. On those sales, net earnings declined 14.2% to $3.75 billion. On a diluted basis, that breaks down to $1.39 per share. Compared to 2018's $1.60 per share, that's a 13.1% decline. On an adjusted basis, JNJ reported earnings of $5.66 billion, which represents a 0.5% increase year over year. That income represents adjusted earnings of $2.10 per diluted share, a 1.9% increase over last year's $2.06 per share.Johnson & Johnson doesn't give GAAP financial guidance due to too much uncertainty. On an adjusted basis it expects diluted earnings per share to increase 4.3#$%$ to $8.53-$8.63. It's relatively unchanged from the guidance provided in January. Analyst estimates seem to put full-year earnings in that range with $8.58 per share. If the company hits those levels, the stock is currently trading at roughly 16.22x forward earnings. That's not a bad valuation as long as the legal battles don't intensify.I do have concerns about how long lawsuits may last stemming from the problems surrounding baby talc powder. Overall, I think I view JNJ as a ""hold"" at present."

Wanted to get the JNJ shot but also wasn't sure it would be approved by the time I was able to get in to get my first vaccine. Long story short went to Levi's Stadium (49ers) today and got my first Pfizer shot. Must say Santa Clara County here in Northern California has there act together. Was a very smooth operation. In and out in 35 minutes from start to finish. Plus got to be inside one of the nicest Football Stadiums in the NFL. Get vaccinated with whatever vaccine is available when it's your turn. It's a very liberating experience when you get the vaccine.

"Shouldn't really be a problem FOR a company with a spotless REPUTATION like JnJJohnson & Johnson Hernia Mesh Lawsuit Filed Over Ethicon Physiomesh Failure, AdhesionsBurdge’s complaint is one of a growing number of Johnson & Johnson hernia mesh lawsuits filed in federal courts nationwide by individuals who experienced complications that were allegedly caused by the Ethicon Physiomesh design. Plaintiffs indicate they have suffered infections, adhesions, severe internal damage and have had to undergo risky revision surgery to have the mesh removed. Often, pieces of the mesh must remain within the body.Rather than promptly issuing a nationwide hernia mesh recall, Johnson & Johnson opted to simply remove the product from shelves and cease further sales within the United States last year. However, individuals nationwide continue to have the defective product in their body and may face continuing risks that the Ethicon Physiomesh may fail.As hernia mesh lawyers continue to review and file a number of lawsuits for individuals nationwide who had Ethicon Physiomesh implanted, a motion was filed last month with U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML), seeking to transfer all cases to the Middle District of Florida for coordinated discovery pretrial proceedings. The panel heard oral arguments on the motion last week in San Antonio, Texas."

How things change? The realization of the need for the IP and financial resources that big pharma can bring to a problem like Covid19 seems to have halted those calling for big pharma punishment.I wonder if these folks will remember this after this crisis passes.

"The reaction to JNJ earnings is totally absurd. JNJ beats on revenues. JNJ beats on EPS. JNJ raised guidance. So basically the stock plunges from $152.50 to 146.50 because of a lauded on covid 19 trials? Are you kidding me? JNJ is developing the vaccine at ZERO MARGIN. It has no impact on earnings anyway. Anyhow I had 500 shares I bought in the $138-139 area and added today at $146.50. BTW, since ear I gs I seen 4 buy rev for JNJ with higher price targets so I have no idea why people are selling JNJ at this point. Incredible imho."

"What? Tech stocks in green and JNJ in red! Don't investors understand that if it's not because of JNJ, the virus will kill not only people but all these tech companies? People needs to get to their offices and farmers have to go to farm, nurses and doctors have to go to hospitals and clinic and engineers need to test equipments.There is no way that this condition can continue and we prison ourself until something happens. That something is either we get the virus or eventually a company develops a vaccine that is safe and it works. That company is JNJ and it will release its 1/2a results soon. It will give us a new hope and new day to look forward. Oh, Phase 3 has started and it must be a very strong results to start a massive phase 3.Today is the chance to buy this cheap price company since it won't be in next few days."

Pipeline include a prostate Imaging Drug with positive late-stage trial results with breakthrough technology which cells estimate twice that of Azedra. Recent public offering raise approximately 90 million dollars which double their cash Reserves. GALT recently completed cirrhosis of the liver Phase 2 trial, with positive results in patients with cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices. FDA recently approved phase 3 trial to include only patients with cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices. phase 3 trial only need to repeat performance of phase 2B trial to be approved by the FDA.GERN partnered with J&J.

Gadeta's proprietary technology in this area, which is a type of cell therapy, may be used to treat blood cancers and solid tumors. Kite will fund the research and development costs and buy equity in Gadeta, with the ""exclusive option"" to acquire Gadeta. Gadeta will also be eligible for milestone payments. Gilead did not disclose financial terms of the deal. Gadeta was founded in 2015 and is based in the Netherlands. Gilead shares slumped 0.5% in premarket trade."

You know you have a winner when there's not a lot of stock pumping going on a chat board . Slow gains all day long
Those stocks that don't pay a dividend seem like a Ponzi scheme to me..Am I right?
JNJ is just as effective as Pfizer FIRST SHOT . its all MISINFORMATION here from the media !do your own DD please !MEDIA is distorted ...just like Hedge Funds and short sellers!

"Interesting that in the half dozen news stories, today, only one mentioned the lower efficacy of the JnJ shot. Someone wants the stock higher."
Looks like a flight to safety now that FAANG stocks are out of favor for the moment. Hopefully JNJ can see a steady rise to 140+ unless there is a complete correction in store for all stocks. GLTA.
Johnson and Johnson is clearly a buy. This company has so much money that they could pay the dividend alone and not make money for the next ten years. The litigation involved in the over hang of Johnson and Johnson will resolve itself over the course of time. This stock is conservatively worth 140.00 at a minimum. The price now has no or little down risk.

Is JNJ interested in ACB?
Will the FDA approval have a positive effect on the price this coming Monday? Should shorters withdraw?
"$JNJ could be looking to Buyout EVOK EVOKE Pharma’s newly only approved Gimoti for Diabetic Gastro relief. Last year world wide sales were 10 billion. This would fit right in with their other lines. CEO Gonyer has always sold off his successful FDA drug approvals. Bausch is also looking to acquire the company. On Monday Evoke will present at the H.C. Wainwright investors convention. Look for a large movement in share value as their are only 22 million shares. The word on the street is a buyout could be for $25. to $35. a share. All analysts have a strong buy rating at $10.00 price tag. Sales for the company start in October, which greatly increase the value, even if a buyout takes a little longer to happen. Bullish"
"Not understanding why if there is urgency to the vaccine process, how JNJ applies for approval and FDA, because they don't meet until the 26th I think stalls the entire process because they don't feel the need to disrupt their schedule or work an extra weekend day to get this moving NOW. VERU announced something meaningful yesterday and who know how long they have to wait. With all the great work our Pharma companies are doing, lets give the chance to accelerate towards cures...."

"U.S orders another 200,000,000 doses from Moderna and Pfizer - doesn't sound like we are waiting for JNJ."
"Sell now or lose next week! Who wants a subpar vaccine?! There will be plenty of Novavax, MRNA and Pfizer vaccine with efficacy in the 90's. Why would anyone want a 60% effective vaccine? Wake up folks!"
For all the Shorts betting on JNJ vaccine having 95% effectiveness. No one will know until late January when early data available. Look at Sanofi trial data vaccine ineffective due to error. What if PFE and MODERNA only 95% effective vaccine until 4th quarter? Don't count your chickens before they hatch!
I hope this is the beginning of a nice recovery that culminates in the 150s by the yearend.
If I was able to choose any vaccine for myself it would be JNJ. ThIs huge study which includes USA South America and South Africa we’re all the horrible variants are had no cases in vaccinated participants after day 49. Home run boys. The news headlines are just selling clicks. ￼

JNJ just won a BOATLOAD of political points by being on the TV with the president.
"So, Esetamine failed but JNJ applied for approval anyway. It seems that JNJ is getting desperate and it takes risk for a failed drug too since it spent so much time and money on it. Johnson & Johnson JNJ announced data from a phase III study, evaluating its investigational esketamine nasal spray in combination with newly initiated oral antidepressant (NIOD) on patients with treatment-resistant depression as compared to placebo nasal spray plus the NIOD. The study failed to demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoint.The primary objective of the program was to show that switching patients to a fixed dose of esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) along with NIOD led to better improvement in depressive symptom in comparison to a shift to placebo coupled with NIOD.The combination failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms after being administered with the 84 mg dose of esketamine nasal spray plus NIOD compared with placebo and NIOD. Therefore, per the prespecified analysis plan, the 56 mg dose could not be formally evaluated through this program. Improvement in symptoms was assessed by the change in a depression severity rating scale score from baseline to four weeks."
JNJ should win that mistrial if there is justice.
I’ve owned since 1988. Just turn off the noise and enjoy the ride. 6 dollar cost basis kiddies.
"JNJ will consider buying CYDY if they keep stepping on their profits. But the facts are here if JNJ is considering that CYDY has the best of all the therapeutics and could enter in the vaccine arena than yes they would be stepping on their profits and should absolutely buy this little company that keeps on proving results for covid 19. It’s much more than covid 19 and in fact covid was not in the thoughts and is just a bonus when approved, notice I say when not if. The big pharmaceuticals may be keeping this down before a vaccine is approved but CYDY has any day on fast track to be announced for phase 3 the results of critical to severe from the FDA. It will be good and might be exactly what’s holding someone from buying or joining CYDY"
when does historically jnj split? I mean at what price about $100 or about $200
Nice to see JNJ keep most of its gains. Lately it's been run up then sell off into the close. People are getting nervous. Can you blame them? Until we get some balance in DC the markets are going to be a royal mess until November 2022.
"One of the reasons for the high rate in New Orleans, is obesity, so the experts have said.When we work through this, Dr. Birx should be looking at the prescribed drugs of those who have died, since many drugs, particularly elective ones, weaken the immune system. The US is a leader in consuming these drugs, and its probably why the US has such a large percent of people showing symptoms, and people dying.Minimally, until further is known, they should call for the end of TV ads until the crisis has passed."
Drug prices will NOT be lowered until there is effective tort reform!!! The mass tort lawyers are the #$%$ of the earth and they are the only ones that benefit from this litigation. Congress must focus on tort reform FIRST.
Any news after hours. I suddenly jumped $2 in heavy volume? I do not see any news that would move the stock. Anyone sees any news releases?
Everybody here after the news.
My trade of the week..JNJ Is above all technical levels. News is also promising along with any good Momenta news.... Should see $157 this week. Good luck everybody.
JNJ CORRECTION OVER????????? THEN HOW HIGH???
Add position today between 122.5 to 127 and will hold for long term for dividend incomes.
add the lawsuits and what do you get? BIG trouble
Ever heard of Johns Mansville? Bankrupt because of asbestos. Ever heard of the movie Michael Clayton? Classis corporate cover up not unlike this. How long is JJ going to last and what growth prospects does this stock have now?
"Why is Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutical) dragging their feet and delaying their Continuation Decision regarding Geron's Imetelstat? Are they trying to acquire cheap shares of Geron while patients die unnecessarily? What happeneed to ""Our Credo challenges us to put the needs and well-being of the people we serve first."""
Now they are finding that it is FEAR that is causing the JNJ VAC issues...people who fear needles wanted the JNJ due to one and done....CDC just issued OK 4 VAC and institutions are already rescheduling for the doses. Way too funny.... AND THIS IS NOT NEW TECHNOLOGY the adenovirus has been used before and has a strong history unlike that of mRNA. Boolean
this is a question for long-term holders of the stock on this board. are lawsuits common for J & J historically?
"The court verdict is absolutely insane. JNJ was declared guilty because they had talc in their products. There has been indeed some controversy regarding possible talc carcinogenicity, but it has never been proven. Talc is an ubiquitous products found in hundreds of other products and used for a century, not only by JNJ. A verdict against JNJ would create a landslide of similar cases against a number of other companies. Because there is no scientific conclusion about talc and carcinogenicity, this process will eventually go to the garbage bin. For instance, alcohol is known to cause cancer, so any beer or vine producer could be sued for not warning the consumers about it. Barbecue is carcinogenic, after all."
didn't expect to turn green today when everyone is tanking!
"JNJ is supposed to be a ""Safe"" stock. I don't think there is a safe stock as long as the Orange Clown is running things in DC. Next year doesn't look any better. I really miss Obama."
So many spams in this chat. Be careful
Monday to the mooonn
What’s wrong with the share price?
JNJ proves one again the value of buying and holding a quality stock in good times and difficult ones like the current situation we find ourselves in today. JNJ has almost made it back to where it closed on February 24th. Pretty impressive given the circumstances.JNJ. Long & Strong!
"JNJ is such a good stock, veryyy nice dividend, stable for long term, what more you can ask?"

GREAT!!!! A new LOW. Thanks a million!
"So I just listened to the reporter on CNBC and essentially she says from time to time there may have been tiny amounts of asbestos in talc and says there is no way to know if in fact it caused anyone's illness. Was it beyond levels deemed safe by the U.S. regulators, well no not really. The report is laughable."
on its way to 115
“Unknown illness” 
Regardless where you stand on the blood clot story what I appreciate is the fact that we live in a country that does have guard-bands in place within our healthcare system. It’s smart to take the pause to understand what’s going on and if there truly is any association with the JNJ vaccine and these blood clots.
ordered only to pay 572 million? that's not a loss.

I'm buying off this dip today. $ 152.05
news has to be around the corner...and it must be good.long JNJ
I can't believe we where mislead that the other two vaccines were 95 % effective - wow they will lie to you about anything to get you out there and spend spend spend - i hope your name doesn't end up somewhere on a wall in Washington
"For those naysayers on this board, the goal is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible . JNJ is a rapid deployment option to give masses of people some protection almost immediately. No liquid nitrogen requirements ... can always be boosted with a second shot thereby bringing efficacy up to 90+% ... it is by no means a failure ... quite the opposite . Read the data ...."
I think can run with a true break over $138.40... watching....
One shot vaccine approve in many more countries
I was selected for the JNJ clinical trial. I'm looking forward to my injection next week. The results released Friday indicate it's a great success. So I'm looking forward toward transitioning back to normalish life.
If you don't exit on Monday then you may see a large loss on Tuesday.
Yahoo Finance Video...............Doctor on J&J vaccine: 'We’re talking about one in a million for these clots'
Most countries cannot handle the 2 dose vaccine. South Africa recognises that and is going first with JNJ.
Will I be able to get this under $157?
Buying dips yup!
Well it's good news bad news . The Good news is mid April things will be closer to normal with most of the vulnerable vaccinated and social restrictions lifting. Unfortunately the bad news is the South African variant.B.1.351 WILL TAKE HOLD IN AUGUST AND WE WILL BE BACK TO SQUARE 1. this variant is very good at evading the current vaccines and new ones will have to be made to combat it. . Unlikely to be much in person learning for the 2021 - 2022 school year.

Great day for humanity. Thank you JNJ.
I'm never going to sell my 500 JNJ shares. I love this company.
"My charitable foundation has a significant positionon JNJ. AMRN, a company with projected earnings of $7 billion dollars over 5 years from their Vascepa Drug has been shortedto a market cap of roughly 2.5 billion dollars. JNJ could buyAMRN for stock and make over $5 billion on transaction.My college friend, Peter Baldwin, (hedge fund billionaire)would facilitate this transaction for no fee for he or his firm.I believe in JNJ and hope some one on this board will reach outto management."
impression from management was that the numbers would be more impressive in line with Moderna and Pfizer so you can see why some selling is here....but better times coming and end of day will be much closer to GREEN - 2nd dose results should be real BOOSTER SHOT TO THE ARM OF SHAREHOLDERS. Boolean
Bad news... 15 million vaccines destroyed!
Why is J&J only up .25 when the DOW is up 800???
"Absolutely hilarious to see the shorts here thinking that their comments affect the stock price. Big money investors aren't stupid. They see the drop, and they think: ""Time to load up!"". They know that this news is a huge nothing-burger. So drop the price in pre-market, and load up for a 5% discount."
tomorrow will be big day for GERN!
Time for JNJ to fire up the buyback guns.
I think it is heading down to $137 to get some strength.

Phase 3 announcement: stock moves up 0.16% rip
PFE's shot may not turn out to be the panacea everyone believes it to be. Some are sounding the alarm of serious reactions to the shot if you have allergies. So how does that work when it requires two shots for this to be effective? If you have a serious reaction the first go round you're not going back for a second so there's zero benefit. Maybe it's best to wait and see what JNJ is offering.
Actelion deal changes the whole thing now for JNJ. Should breathe fresh life into JNJ growth. We should see the stock moving to 130 soon.

A probe does not assume guilt. DOJ just doing it's due diligence. Hundreds of studies have proven talc to be safe. This should resolve the argument once and for all. The market reaction is typical. Throw the baby out with the bath water. Overreactions are never a time to sell. Plus if the stock was $200 today I wouldn't be selling. Let's see where we are in 5 years. GLTA longs while we battle yet another headline story.
Seeing a ~$20 pullback in the last few weeks hurt RSU valuations that vested and paid out on 2/10/18 but certainly higher than the $115 from last year. Thanks JNJ. Appreciate the continued rise in PPS over the years.

"Bought some puts here before the verdict. I think there is way too much downside risk. I think the precedent was set with the tobacco companies and they really want to hit the opioid producers hard. JNJ is the only one that didn't settle. Either way I'm sure it will be appealed, but I see a lot of downside risk with maybe a small upside depending on outcome today at 4. But if it's high billions as a judgment this will tank short term as states line up with their hand out even though today's verdict will be far from the last of these lawsuits. They will cost a lot either way."

"There’s another potential problem. Just as human bodies develop immune responses to most real viral infections, our bodies also develop immunity to adenoviral vectors. That makes booster shots of adenoviral vector vaccines problematic. Upon a second injection, our bodies will unleash an antibody attack on the vaccine itself. And since adenoviral vectors are based on natural viruses that some of us might already have been exposed to, the vaccines might not work for everyone."
JNJ doing great today. LexaGene (LXXGF) has a pathogen diagnostic instrument that gets results in an hour. JNJ will probably be interested in them.
JNJ only has 1% of the Opioid market. Why are they paying the highest?
"We are creating a society that gives everyone a hall pass on personal accountability. I have always known taking an opioid, cocaine, cigar nicotine) will be addictive. Now I can sue and get money, because I am no longer responsible for my choice or my action. This is a crazy world. We should be ashamed."
"They say JNJ stock is stable. It is very stable in green days and it does not jump up but gains a little bit which may lose it at the end of the day or stay flat. However, red days starts with low and continues to go down steady. JNJ is created a new meaning for being stable. Just fire this JNJ useless management."
"Why is this stock goes up?If it is because of the vaccine, they charge $10 per doze which I assume does not make any profit."

Loose hand shake out. This is old news and a plaintiff lawyer driven report to drive stock down. I'd like to see an investigation to see who is short and who went short right before Reuters released this information.JNJ has never lost an appeal in court on any lawsuit. $150 by March 2019.

I guess we wait for later this month to see if I’m right or wrong. Nothing today changes my bearish view. If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative."" https://t.co/UKOlyO799ETweet from Adam Feurstein This is the first time he put the possibility of being wrong into his equation. His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D"

I believe the company, not the Reuters hack piece with questionable motives IMO.Statement on Reuters Talc ArticleNew Brunswick, NJ (December 14, 2018) -- Johnson & Johnson today issued the following statement regarding speculation about the safety of our products.The Reuters article is one-sided, false, and inflammatory. Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder is safe and asbestos-free. Studies of more than 100,000 men and women show that talc does not cause cancer or asbestos-related disease. Thousands of independent tests by regulators and the world’s leading labs prove our baby powder has never contained asbestos. Johnson & Johnson will continue to defend the safety of our product. For the truth and facts about talc, please go to www.factsabouttalc.com.The Reuters article is wrong in three key areas:The article ignores that thousands of tests by J&J, regulators, leading independent labs, and academic institutions have repeatedly shown that our talc does not contain asbestos.The article ignores that J&J has cooperated fully and openly with the U.S. FDA and other global regulators, providing them with all the information they requested over decades. We have also made our cosmetic talc mines and processed talc available to regulators for testing. Regulators have tested both, and they have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.The article ignores that J&J has always used the most advanced testing methods available to confirm that our cosmetic talc does not contain asbestos. Every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free."

This is a great shot for those who are fearful of the mRNA vaccines.. JJ uses the same method used in Flu Shots... all three shots are safe but having an option for the highly suspicious should lead to more vaccinations in those hesitant on vaccination.
the JNJ vaccine looks like a big step up!
Could JNJ be prepping manufacturing capacity for MRNA vaccine and possible buyout?
I love all the bear day traders in here trying to dog this stock till they can get in on it Monday morning like it isn’t going to pull some hard gains right off the rip.
JNJ slowly and steadily gaining back again. It is a matter of time and we will be back in 140s.

Again from 1971-2000That question will take years to work thru the courts, as have the other (yes past tense and multiple) cases already involving asbestos in J&J baby powder. Sensational news story, old news."

"BEVERLY, Mass., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioVie Inc. (BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that it has achieved 50% enrollment of the patients in its open-label Phase 2a clinical study of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin) for treating refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis.BioVie is conducting a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical trial of its Orphan Drug candidate, BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has FDA Fast Track status and US patent protection. This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. Sure this is a highly speculative stock. But the FDA has blessed it by assigning both orphan drug and FDA fast track status which in my opinion establish some reduce risk factor. No one should invest more than 1% of their portfolio in a speculative stock. At the amazing price of $0.03 per share, I think this is one of the most undervalued stock in the development of Nash related drugs. DD."
"Current stock price is not reflecting fundamentals, earnings, and pipeline for JNJ. The negative impact to share price due to a non-medical community's view on vaccine efficacy will force a positive correction at some point. JNJ diversification (pharm, device, consumer) shields large swings and keeps the company profitable. This is oversold."
"If people are hoping JNJ is a growth stock they are sadly mistaken. JNJ has never been a growth stock. It's been steady and reliable for decades. If you think one day this stock is going to act like a NFLX, AMZN or FB you are sadly mistaken and probably should sell and buy those stocks. Don't expect something from JNJ that is not advertised. Accept it for what it is or walk away."
$608.47 Thanks JNJ!
i just laugh at these stock traders looking for yield and buying absolute trash stocks/companies and wondering why their dividend got cut or the stock lost half its value. love jnj.

JNJ will be $170 soon . AKER has a chance? Please help .AKER is a$16M microcap with advanced COVID-19 vaccine plan
JNJ may announce phase 1 or 2 of the new vaccine at any time and the stock will be over $160 in a blink.

"iOpioid epidemic: New Jersey sues Johnson & Johnson subsidiary over deceptive marketingTHIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM THIS ARTICLE Lindy Washburn, North Jersey Record Published 3:13 p.m. ET Nov. 13, 2018 | Updated 12:14 a.m. ET Nov. 14, 2018Of particular concern was the company's focus on expanding its market share by targeting the elderly and people who had not used opioids before, the lawsuit said. It did this through sham organizations like the ""Let's Talk Pain"" Coalition and websites such as ""PrescribeResponsibly.com"" that conceal the company's role, the lawsuit claimed. Its pamphlets falsely debunked so-called opioid myths by saying ""many studies show that opioids are rarely addictive when properly used for the management of chronic pain."" These claims had no scientific evidence to back them up, said Paul R. Rodriguez, acting director of the Division of Consumer Affairs. Four out of five heroin addicts started with prescription painkillers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. New Jersey has had 2,690 deaths from opioid overdoses this year, as of Nov. 4, according to statistics kept by the Attorney General's Office. That already is 90 more deaths than in all of last year."
Can it go to $133?
The non scientific survey does not seem supportive of a fact based case.The shear numbers here when one considers extraneous variables would make assigning blame/fault extremely difficult.
This new format stinks

"Abandoning this stock. People is far from fond to this company. Check on twitter for #JNJ, #johnson&johnson and #johnsonandjohnson - People is upset at their new ""skin color"" product to match African American's skin color, specifically, the same community is not reacting well to this. Moreover, people are against this company for the talcum powder that induced cancer and consequently, people do not want their vaccines. This will not go much higher. Get out while you can. I did loose some money here, but anyway."
Now is the time to load up more. Look beyond the vaccine news.
I bought under 130 but probably won't get any chances to increase my position
Time for JNJ stock split. Price doesn’t change but more shares in a solid growth company that will continue upward trends.jg
With all the court cases pending and awards given to the tune of 535 Million and more to come this company is up???
whats the word on the paused vaccine?
I hold JNJ-and Pfizer - and it seemed that Pfizer stock prices have not increased after the virus vaccine was introduced.I am disappointed in the stock price movement of Pfizer. For some reason Pfizer does not increase. I also read that the vaccine under JNJ will be free but staff involved with the administration of the vaccine will be a charging for services but will be reimbursed by insurance company. I am wondering if JNJ stock will have much of an increase if they release a vaccine. I am a long time holder over many year of JNJ.
Politicians and Judge are in bed with big Pharma... generics can’t win. $MNK $JNJ $TEVA $ENDP

jNj vaccine in is an amazing product! better than any others! hold long guys!
JNJ vaccine 99% effective in keeping YOU out of hospital !thats all that matters for now !
"At first glance, the results reported Friday from the long-awaited trial of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine might have seemed disappointing. Its overall efficacy — the ability to prevent moderate and severe disease — was reported at 72% in the United States, 66% in Latin American countries and 57% in South Africa.Those figures appear far below the high bar set by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the first two vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States, which reported overall efficacy from 94% to 95%.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and now the lead medical adviser to President Joe Biden on the coronavirus pandemic, acknowledged the striking difference at a briefing Friday.“If you woke up and you say, ‘Well, go to the door on the left and you get 94 or 95%, go to the door on the right and you get 72%,’ which door do you want to go to?” he asked.But Fauci said that the more crucial measure was the ability to prevent severe disease, which translates to keeping people out of the hospital and preventing deaths. And that result, for Johnson & Johnson, was 85% in all of the countries where it was tested, including South Africa, where a rapidly spreading variant of the virus had shown some ability to elude vaccines.More important than preventing “some aches and a sore throat,” Fauci said, is to fend off severe disease, especially in people with underlying conditions and in older adults, who are more likely to become seriously ill and to die from COVID-19.“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress in human suffering and death in this epidemic that we’re seeing, particularly now,” Fauci said, “as we well know, over the last several weeks, our health care system has been stressed by the number of people that require hospitalization, as well as intensive care.”Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, compared the ability to prevent severe disease to the effects of flu shots, which do not always prevent influenza entirely but can make it less severe.“The same thing seems to be applying here, in a circumstance where this variant is clearly making it a little tougher to get the most vigorous response that you would want to have,” Collins said. “But still, for severe disease, it’s looking really good.”The Moderna vaccine also showed high efficacy, 100%, against severe disease. The Pfizer-BioNTech one appeared to as well, but the overall number of severe cases in the study was too small to be sure.But researchers warn that trying to compare effectiveness between new studies and earlier ones may be misleading, because the virus is evolving quickly and to some extent the trials have studied different pathogens.“You have to recognize that Pfizer and Moderna had an advantage,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said. “They did their clinical trials before the variant strains became very apparent. Johnson & Johnson was testing its vaccine not only against the standard strain but they had the variants.”The best way to stop the spread of mutants and to prevent more new ones from emerging is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, Fauci and other researchers say. Viruses cannot mutate unless they are replicating, and they cannot replicate unless they can get into cells. Keeping them out by immunizing people can shut down the process.In addition to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines already in use in the United States, three more may soon become available: those made by Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has already been authorized in Britain and other countries.Globally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected to play an important role, especially in low and middle-income countries, because it works after just one shot, is relatively inexpensive, and is easier to store and distribute than the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna because it does not share their stringent requirements for freezing and refrigerating."
it will break 130 by the end of Friday
JNJ is 1 of the 4 companies the Government is funding with a very promising vaccine!! Why would you sell this? JNJ could and will definitely benefit from all of this HUGELY in the future!! GLTA
"@Newman, I kind of agree with you that Invokana will be huge liability for JNJ as a large scale of class law suit would bankrupt JNJ. But there is a very promising substitute for Invokana that JNJ can acquire LXRX for its anti-diabetes T1/2 Sotagliflizon which has been in clinical trial on thousands of cases for last five years without single case of serious AEs, but with additional benefits of weight reduction, blood pressure reduction and hepatic steatosis reduction."
"All of my friends searched for the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, not wanting the less effective JnJ one. Now add the blood clots, and no one who is aware of JnJ's issues will want it. The stock rose because of hope that once the first rollout is over, JnJ will make a profit on it. It is not likely to happen."
JNJ stock seems to be perking up here!
"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a 6.3% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, from $0.95 per share to $1.01 per share."
"I think the investing audience is under valuing the JNJ vaccine results - stuck on the 66% world or 72% efficacy numbers compared to the headline 95% for the 2 dose options after both shots - and not looking at this in a complete sense. The JNJ vaccine is 72% effective at illness prevention with one shot - compared to ~50% for the first dose of the 2 shot options. JNJ reaches 100% effectiveness at hospitalization and death prevention after 28 days - compared to 45 days and requiring the 2nd shot for the 2 dose vaccines. Combine this with the fact that the one shot vaccine is easier to distribute, only requiring basic refrigeration and the fact that many people will not get the 2nd shot of the 2 dose options at all or in the right time period then the JNJ vaccine is arguably a superior vaccine option to control COVID more quickly and more completely than the 2 dose options."

Another Gorsky day. Why are we shareholders paying him so much to lose money?
"A 5% increase would bring the dividend to $4 a share. This legal overhang is a gift. If you’d bought during the recall scandals in 2012 and held til today, you’ve more than doubled your money and you’re getting a 6.5% yield on cost."

"Still like JNJ for the long term holding, short term a lot of headwinds for lawsuits. It has a pristine balance sheet provided the liability from the lawsuit is not too high.

Good lucks."

"Back to NewsJohnson & Johnson's Stock Gains After Profit And Revenue Beat, Raised Outlook -- MarketWatch7 minutes agoDow Jones NewswiresRelated InvestmentsJohnson & JohnsonLast 3 MonthsShares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rallied 0.7% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the pharmaceutical and consumer products company reported first-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations, and raised its sales outlook. Net income slipped to $4.37 billion, or $1.60 a share, from $4.42 billion, or $1.61 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.06, above the FactSet consensus of $2.00. Revenue rose 12.6% to $20.01 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $19.50 billion, as consumer, pharmaceutical and medical device revenue all rose above expectations. For 2018, J&J raised its revenue guidance range to $81.0 billion to $81.8 billion from $80.6 million to $81.4 billion, and affirmed its adjusted EPS outlook of $8.00 to $8.20. Separately, the company said it was implementing cost-cutting actions aimed at producing annual savings of $600 million to $800 million by 2022, and which will lead to restructuring charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. The actions to be taken haven't been finalized. The stock has lost 5.7% year to date through Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 0.6%."

"Such an unethical company. Do a google search for ""asbestos in baby powder"", scroll down to the google suggestion of what people search for. Click the tab with the question: ""Does J&J baby powder contain asbestos?"". According to Johnson & Johnson's webpage (which they now removed the following content): ""Fact #1: Since the 1970s, talc used in consumer products has been required to be asbestos-free, so JOHNSON'S talc products do not contain asbestos, a substance classified as cancer-causing."" The only way to look at this statement is via cache or through the method I described above since google search engine takes time to update content in their listing.UNETHICAL, and I grew up using J&J baby powder. Anyone exposed (baby, caregiver, parents) might be at health risk!"
"Think GERN , Cheap now, J&J take over soon. take a peek, up 6%00 so far today"
Why is JNJ up on such a horrible market day? Could it be people are realizing juries act irrationally and arrive at ridiculous monetary awards when they allow their emotions to overrule science and decades of independent product testing?

J&J should cover their short in GERN. They have had plenty of time to buy cheap shares. Why do they continue to hide information like this about GERN?

JNJ 85% good to keep from getting too sick or dying plus no need for freezer just regular refrigeration. One shot and can produce the vaccine very fast. Will be used all over the world. Stick with JNJ.
"less than 1 in 4 unvaccinated adults want to take J&J vaccine. this must be why it dropped. Strangely the CDC never emphasized that this thing can be fixed if it very rarely occurs. If you have stomach or head ache 1 week or so after getting the vaccine, just go to your doctor. simple."
wow.stop taking the jnj vaccine and take pfizer.leave money and stocks out of it

"Look at the volume. This is not a selloff where folks are panicking and bailing out at any price. It feels almost entirely algo driven. Buying opportunity, as this thing will get up off the mat."
Asbestos causes lung cancer and other cancers associated with exposure through breathing or swallowing. There is no proof that it causes cancer through contact with the skin.
"I don't think anybody can sue J&J for vaccine side effects as they have Federal immunity, but confidence in their vaccine will plummet."
Does anyone know when the dividends will be paid
Regular DRIP shares bought for $155.07 on 3/4. Next up is the dividend purchase on 3/8. Hoping to get a decent price for this purchase too which would be anything between $150 & $160.

NanoFlu showed not only non-inferior, but increased immunogenicity compared to Fluzone in this Phase 3 study across the four strains used to formulate it, as well as, and importantly, H3N2 drifted strains, Duncan tells investors in a research note. The analyst says the efficacy component of the clinical profile, combined with safety, lowers the clinical, regulatory, and even commercial risk of a new NanoFlu-driven vaccine paradigm in the future, but also should enhance conviction on Novavax's platform more broadly."

"Azedra sales could grow rapidly in a very short period of time. Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) are aware of who and where the patients are and there's no other cure or treatment.

Progenics Pharmaceuticals will be reporting top-line data from the trial in the fourth quarter of 2018 while initiating a second Phase 3 study of PyL in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer by year end.Progenics' first commercial product, RELISTOR it's already generating Revenue with expected Milestones payments.Based on the above, I think progenics Pharmaceuticals is currently worth $20+ per share and by 2019 stock price could be $50+ per share."
Of course there is asbestos in talc - always was - just a matter of the amount - who really cares? Just don't smoke if you are breathing in asbestos.
Going through the floor hard. Almost 2 years worth of dividends gone in 4 hours trading. Thats stock investing for ya!
JNJ quarterly earnings beat 4 Qtrs in a row; perhaps more. I only check the last 4 qtrs. Forward PE is 15.x per Yahoo Finance. JNJ is a solid buy and hold IMO.

Going to 153
I'm a long for 25 years and do have to laugh at those that thought by owning JNJ before it was approved was going to make you rich. As you see thats not the case and if you want to get rich with JNJ I suggest you buy when you can and not touch it until you retire. The hype on this vaccine sucked in a lot of dreamers.
Is there a call tomorrow?Anyone know topic(s)?

"Congrats, JnJ! As an ordinary retail stock trader, I see you as a benchmark of the “correction” going on in the Stock market. I believed your vaccine will be a game-changer. "
if you ever bother to wonder why SharkBait gets negative reviews it is because he is a fake poster who used to spend time years ago enjoying being rude and spreading stories about how he retired and walked away with tons of options from a silicon valley company. a person that refers to other posters as MF speaks for itself as a fake. now he has toned it down and makes believe that he is a big JNJ shareholder because his spouse worked there. more false facts if the past is an indication

"Bench Trials A bench trial takes place in front of a judge only; there is no jury involved. The judge is both the finder of fact and ruler on matters of law and procedure. This means that the judge decides the credibility of the evidence presented at trial and also decides what happens at the trial according to laws and rules of procedure.Since this a bench trial and not a jury trial, facts will determine the outcome and not out of control emotions. JNJ will be fine and possibly come out stronger in the end. Pick up some cheap shares before Wall Street comes to their senses."

"Johnson & Johnson Plunges Johnson & Johnson JNJ shares dropped the most in more than 15 years Friday following a Reuters report that said the company knew for decades that its iconic baby powder sometimes contained asbestos and failed to alert authorities. Johnson & Johnson reportedly knew both its raw talc and finished powder tested positive for traces of asbestos, a carcinogen, citing documents linked to a court case that saw a jury in Missouri award $4.7 billion to 22 women who said that the products contained asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer. Reuters also said the company tried, unsuccessfully, to influence plans by U.S. regulators to reduce the amount of asbestos that could legally remain in some cosmetic talc products. ""The Reuters article is one-sided, false and inflammatory,"" Johnson & Johnson said in an emailed statement to TheStreet. ""Simply put, the Reuters story is an absurd conspiracy theory, in that it apparently has spanned over 40 years, orchestrated among generations of global regulators, the world's foremost scientists and universities, leading independent labs, and J&J employees themselves."" ""We note that all issues reported were previously disclosed as part of talc litigation discovery. As we think about the risk to JNJ here, we see today's move as an over-reaction, especially from a longer-term perspective,"" said JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott. ""At the same time, talc does not seem to be an issue that is going to resolve quickly for JNJ and we would expect shares to trade at a lower multiple pending further clarity on the company's exposure to this issue (which could be an extended period of time)."" Since the publication of the Reuters story, Johnson & Johnson lost all of the stock's year-to-date gains and wiped out $39.5 billion in market value, reported TheStreet's Martin Baccardax. When the market closed, the company was down over 10% to $132.86 a share."

Looks like this is going to fall right through $150 tomorrow. Depending on how the market finishes the week. Next week we could test the previous bottom of $144 and if we break that than possibly $137. Right now a lot of big name stocks are retesting their previous 6 month price. I hope We get a turnaround next week after this brutal 2 week correction.

"The ex-div is August 24, that means the dividend ($1.01/shr) is paid to shareholders who the shares before 8/24. Since the market is closed on 8/23 and 8/22 (weekends) then the last day to own the share is 8/21. So only 5 trading day is left for buying for dividend (8/17 to 8.21). I don't wait for 8/20 and 8/21 since historically, one or two days before ex-div, the stock tend to run hard since it attracts some players who play dividend. So, 8/17 to 8/19 are the period for me to add more. I've been waiting for one of my IRA account to settle to buy more in next 3 days. I will be so lucky is I can get it below $148 but if I don't the I still buy it above $148 to gain $1.01 per shares."
What does JNJ do when the market crashes?
"I'm surprised there have been no comments about the Bloomberg article posted earlier today with the headline:""J&J's Sudden Talc-Cancer Settlements Aren#$%$ Usual Style.Check out the 18th (I think I counted correctly) paragraph.Where is this article? Below JNJ quote."

Expect the stock to inch up as we head towards the ex dividend date May 25.
"2-4% fall after opening, and -20% the following months. Will be just like with PFE."
Should results on single dose be out by now? JNJ double dose test started 2 months later and due in January. Are they holding single dose results until then?

JNJ didn't want to disclose yesterday if the sick volunteer received the vaccine or placebo. You would think by this morning that JNJ would have come out and said the volunteer received the placebo? So I have to ASSume the volunteer received the vaccine.
"Time to accumulate some shares since JNJ hits lower Bollinger Band at $135. It was trading range bound recently, good time to write some covered calls when at $140 and buy some longer date calls at $130. Good luck longs."

"jnj has always said they would sell the vaccine at cost... for them its about the goodwill and strengthening their vaccine discovery capabilities.what i am concerned about the hefty price jnj has been paying of recent acquisitions and using debt, though, however little, to fund those acquisitions. jnj's credit rating was and still is higher than even the US government bonds. I am not aware of any other company having such strong credit rating. But that might get downgraded due to using debt to fund lofty acquisitions.i still consider this a low risk stock to own with possibility of very slow stock appreciation over the years."

"I find it interesting that most of the day on Cnbc they have been comparing the loss of market cap to the potential cost of this news. Imo, the two are not related. The market cap has to do with the future prospects of the business and its growth value as a function of its price to earnings ratio. The potential for this, if true, to erode and destroy consumer sentiment and brand trust is very real. If that happens, $40 billion mkt cap loss will be just the beginning. We shall see"

Today is simply a typical overreaction to little to no details of the pause of a phase 3 trail which by the way happens all the time in trials. However the daily false claims by the Covid infected President that a vaccine will be available before the election has put undue pressure on Pharma. Pauses are part of any phase 3 trail but because it's a Covid vaccine the sensitivity is off the charts thus the overreaction today. GLTA

JNJ opens above $150 once again and collapses to $148? Any thought about this pattern. Cramer once again spoke highly of JNJ last night. Is this stock capable of holding $150? What it is interesting is that after Q1 results the stock traded as high as $157. I fail to understand the collapse once again. We not even at the April highs. Any thoughts why the stock is trading g so poorly today. Could not even hold $148.

Even as the cryptocurrency market including bitcoin seems to be a bit unbalanced at the moment, i still find this period so useful as it is a very good time to buy and find a working strategy/platforms to accumulate and grow which will be well backed up with guidance provided by a pro-trader Expert Brian Scott. what you need now is a strategy and accurate platform to build a very strong portfolio with the little you have now. Quite a number of crypto traders including newbies may be scared about trading due to this pullback in the market which i see as lack of experience and research about what strategy and signals to trade with. Due to my detailed research, i was able to know about Brian Scoot’s strategy (price action) and daily signals which is so accurate and profitable to me ever since the last bear market, during my first month i was able to increase and grow my 1.2btc to a total of 5.9btc with his platform.

Holding this forever. No reason to sell this. Anyone that tells you otherwise just wants your shares.

"The 30 day and 5 graph is all positive, the stock is currently at it 52 week high, the volume is increasing. pretty sure we are going to get some good news soon on vaccine data. Stay safe"
Does the trade war effect JNJ stock?
"Perfect stock to own in a crisis. Good well supported dividend that has been consistently raised, solid financial strength, stable stock. I will be long this during and also after the crisis."
JNJ putting money where its mouth is. Buying back 5 billion dollar worth of its own stock. Speaks to the confidence. Add if you can.
$200 monday. Whooohooo
"Gupta is a cnn hack, just wait for real facts to appear"
I believe JNJ should be handsomely rewarded. Enough for them to increase to 200.00 per share with a 7% yield.
"HEALTH AND SCIENCEFauci says all three Covid vaccines highly effective, urges people to take shot most availablePUBLISHED SUN, FEB 28 202110:37 AM EST"
if we don't put the vaccine in the market for 50 times what it's worth I will not be happy I might even sell
wow， this is awesome 
Sad death stock making money off dead family members.So sad
"As per world authority, Dr. Mobeen Syed, JNJ’s COVID vaccine is the best of the current lot. I am personally waiting for that vaccine, although I qualify for 2 others right now."
hi guys I'm new I just have a question...why regeneron only has 64 billion market cap meanwhile this company have 400 bill market cap but regenerons sp is higher? thnks
Does JNJ have a two dose study underway that might show they have a vaccine as good as the others currently available? Just wondering.
Yes yes yes but when will/if JNJ get back to 52 week high?
Wow everything is green after Powell spoke except this
"Premas , the partner of AKER for Covid19 vaccine has started tests of it vaccine with animals on 5/3/20 . AKER cap is $17M"
"Gap and fade. Sad. Incredibly low volume also. Just no interest. However, it does look like a pretty good dividend play right here. Good yield. And perhaps now trading at the low end of its range. There should be some buyers coming in, but maybe slowly over time. This time next year, definitely higher, maybe by a good amount."
"Trump wants to change the food stamps now also I believe it shouldn't be for the elder but let me give you a dim picture , went to the store to get things to make dinner yes I'm the Cook also my wife doesn't cook in front of me I would say 32 year old woman was checking out 210.00 dollars of high end foods she was dressed really nice at the end she paid with a link card ( food stamps) I was like ok . I finished checking out as I got into the parking lot I see her putting her groceries into a 3 year old mercedies Benz tell me what's wrong with that picture."
I've looked at what the government has ordered and my chances of getting the vaccine in the first quarter next year is probably dependent on JNJ's successful January results and there is a good chance that will happen. JNJ has told us they plan for 1 billion doses next year which is great but my question is do we have any idea how much they plan to produce through the first quarter of 2021?
Buy buy buy
"i told u guys before, my 12/28 125 put is up 70% today"

"Good bye WTO. You helped China infect the world, which led to 365,000 deaths. the doctors, staff and management of the WTO are conflicted, as they realize the more pandemics there are, the more money they will get with their research budgets and drugs sales. Everyone in the WHO who did what China told them, should lose their medical licenses. And be banned from holding any medical job for the rest of their lives. And part of their wealth should be spent on restitution for victims. Its good to see the WTO defunded. Hopefully we'll see other corrupt world organizations get defunded as well. And a public trial of the people that colluded with China would bring some sense of justice for all of us who have suffered because of them."
i should have bought in 2016 when it was 125. This is heading to 200 plus
This is a buy right here. My guess is a large investor wanted into a position into this high dividend paying stock and crashed the price. Now they will be all set for the next bear market and have a solid position to ride out the next storm.
Huge buy opportunity

I personally would like a $MRK deal over a $JNJ deal. Mainly becuse Merck has brought a vaccine pill to market already. Not Covid but they mut be interested and they could close the gap and get this to market.

This thing should easily get to 134. Buyers just need to come out to play.

Why down? Anyone?

I added down over $9. It’s a story. No word from the company they hid this info. And the article says it tested sometimes. This is a core holding and when have you ever see the stock down this much?
A bit over reacted !J&J not the only Co. putting out Baby Powder. Perhaps the oldest
"JNJ looking good here - robust revenue, profits, and a Covid-19 vaccine play. It's a gimme."
Jnj heading lower like I said.
It is only one of the 5 pivotal studies. You do not need statistical significance on all 5 trials to get approval.
At this rate Dow may be at 8000 by mid march.JNJ will be 50 bucks by then.

"A South Carolina jury failed to reach a verdict in the second trial of a lawsuit claiming Johnson & Johnson’s baby powder caused a rare cancer linked to asbestos exposure.Judge Jean Toal ordered a mistrial Thursday evening after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked 11-1 in the lawsuit brought by the husband of lawyer Bertile Boyd-Bostic, who died at age 30 of mesothelioma. The first trial on the claim in May also ended with a hung jury.Boyd-Bostic’s husband argued J&J knew in the 1970s its talc products contained the carcinogen and failed to warn the public to protect its iconic brand. He sought more than $62 million in damages over his wife’s death. J&J denies its baby powder has ever been tainted with asbestos.“We look forward to a new trial to present our defense, which rests on decades of independent, non-litigation driven scientific evaluations, none of which have found that Johnson’s Baby Powder contains asbestos,” Kim Montagnino, a J&J spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement.The mistrial comes on the heels of a California jury’s decision Wednesday to reject a woman’s claims that asbestos-laced baby powder caused her mesothelioma. The panel found plaintiff Carla Allen was exposed to baby powder fouled by asbestos, but that wasn’t a “substantial factor” in causing her cancer."
tomorrow is exdividend day .90.
"I'm humored by the emotional JNJ longs: they are questioning the skills / calling for the head of the lab employee(s) that discovered an asbestos tainted sample; it's the SAME lab JNJ has used to REFUTE the presence of asbestos in its baby powder!!!""J&J's own expert, working for FDA, found asbestos in Baby Powder""""In challenging the FDA’s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts.The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J.Andreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defence against plaintiffs’ claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers.He testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson's Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company’s argument that its iconic brand is safe."" Sort of a pickle for JNJ."

Anaphilaxis in 2 people following the vaccine means J&J's vaccine will require those vaccinated to stay put for at leas an hour's observation and that the facility have stocks of epinephrine on hand to handle side effects. How big a damper will this be on the vaccine?

I’m signing up for the JNJ vaccine.￼
JNJ closed at all time high last week.That is bullish. No bull market complete without JNJ participating in it. I expect a run to 180.
"If JNJ is serious about rapidly developing a vaccine for coronovirus they should look to either partner with or acquire INO. My guess,if they act quickly is that the entire company can be bought for about 1and1/2 billon dollars. INO has claimed last week by their CEO Kim on tv that they have a vaccine."
Lab A/C unit was contaminated with asbestos. No asbestos is bottle of powder itself.
"JNJ, MSFT and V are few of my best quality holdings. I have positions held for long term and short term. For the short term trade since S&P 500 has hit the short term resistance of 2750, all positions are closed. Will open selling puts once the price corrects. I believe we will have a double bottom, that means S&P 500 will hit 2200 again."
Does anyone know the average yearly dividend yield of JNJ throughout its history? I'm guessing 2.5%
"An important distinction is individual protection vs population protection to control the pandemic. The J & J vaccine should help from an epidemiological perspective but not as protective as Pfizer/Moderna for an individual. Let’s see what Dr Fauci (who already received the Moderna vaccine) and the task force decide for the country From an individual standpoint, I plan on taking the vaccine. I would want the vaccine with the highest efficacy otherwise I would be hesitant to resume a more normal lifestyle."
Interesting. I have noticed that JNJ most of the time goes up after going ex-dividend! Lets hope that continues here.
"Re today's Xarelto settlement:“Even in the face of meritless allegations, and even while winning in court, complex litigation demands an enormous amount of time and resources,” the pharmaceutical division of Johnson & Johnson explained in a statement regarding the settlement.“Because of this litigation, our talented scientists and researchers, our employees and many doctors across the country have had to spend numerous hours answering questions from plaintiff lawyers, compiling documents those lawyers have asked for, and otherwise being pulled away from their passion for patient care. As a healthcare company, we want to spend every moment we can improving lives and finding new cures.”"

"The magic of J&J is broken. Problems, lawsuits, problems, lawsuits, problems. Misses, downgrades, dividend cuts in the future. J&J has become a strong sell."
Stable and progressing stock with good dividend. What else do we want? JNJ may be volatile as the market is but it does not drop 10% all the sudden like other stocks. It will go up gradually and steady.
"jnj always a good investment, I have been putting $150/mo for the last 20 yrs."
"From J&J board! I still believe $JNJ will drop $GERN imetelstat. I guess we wait for later this month to see if I’m right or wrong. Nothing today changes my bearish view. If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative. https://t.co/UKOlyO799ETweet from Adam Feurstein This is the first time he put the possibility of being wrong into his equation. His thesis is that JNJ will drop imetelstat because they didn't focus on imetelstat in the cc? Pretty flimsy Adam. JNJ definitely reaffirmed they would be making a decision whether or not to continue the collaboration by the end of the month. Obviously, yesterday wasn't the day for the announcement. JNJ did prominently identify imetelstat as a potential blockbuster drug to be filed for an NME application in the near term future for MF. Meanwhile they have surely enrolled numerous patients in phase 3 IMERGE who are chomping at the bit to start receiving imetelstat and even listed imetelstat for unapproved use as a compassionate use drug. Duh! That means one thing. ... it's working. I'm not too worried about AF's bearish opinion. His weakness is in predicting which drugs will or won't get approval. JNJ and/or FDA and/or EMA would have ended the trials by now if the drug was a dud. If JNJ were planning to drop imetelstat, they wouldn't have listed it in numerous slides, instead it would have been mysteriously, quietly missing. They certainly wouldn't have added a new indication. What wasn't said is that IMERGE is in fast track status. It's all about the results in the special expanded subset of E refractory, L & H naive, and non del 5q which are becoming clear by now. Good results here could mean advanced approval. I have a hunch the results are far better than just good.Remember, Unmet need, first and only in-class drug, huge platform potential and documented clinical remissions. Why would JNJ walk away from gross world wide sales to get out of paying 65 million? The only thing I can agree on with AF is that we will definitely know if he is right or wrong by the end of the month. Good luck longs! Go Imetelstat! : - D"

Johnson & Johnson is My Favorite Dividend King For Reliable Dividend Growth And Income. This dividend king has paid dividends since 1944 and has managed to increase them for 56 years in a row. Dividend increases have been like clockwork every year for decades. JNJ raised its dividend by 7.10% to 90 cents/share last week. Check my analysis below:https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/2018/04/johnson-johnson-my-favorite-dividend.html

I think the market is not going to go down until DOW hit the new hight. I bought JNJ at 149.50 this morning and sold Sept 150 call at 5.25 and bought Sept 18 150 put for 1.25. I really don't care the direction at this point.

"Just now, Johnson & Johnson Innovation Invests US$3.9 Million In Singapore R&D. As we know that Asia is the potential market of medicine because of a large population. So I think $JNJ made a correct decision this time. Besides, Finstead said that Johnson & Johnson is looking to increase its presence in emerging markets as they hold immense potential. Given the huge potential, the company has set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India, and has almost doubled its footprint in emerging markets in the last five years. These countries are trying to make healthcare accessible to more people primarily by improving insurance coverage. Johnson & Johnson intends to continue working on strengthening its pipeline in Japan as well as China. ( https://www.finstead.com/posts/JNJ-buy-or-sell ) How do you think $JNJ strategies in Asia?"

Don't allow J&J to pour money into ones that promote hatred, or allows and even encourages it."
JNJ is a buy here
why is this the only company with posts of impending doom. My guess is that there are people posting that want JJ to drop because they shorted the stock
"Not sure what else J&J needs to do - great Q1 and Q2 results, double digit growth, strong pipeline, future forecast. Lawsuits are a drag but in the end J&J has them managed as science is on their side. Price should be well above $130 and should not have declined so much this year."
buy buy on the drop
"With a price target of $156, this is a good strike price.J NJ is a huge company which makes it a target for the ambulance chasers (be wary of fake news), but the size also makes it a very viable investment and capable of keeping the chasers at bay."

"Its Big Coronavirus Vaccine News?The clock is definitely ticking.Keith SpeightsKeith Speights(TMFFishBiz)Jan 26, 2021 at 6:09AMAuthor BioThe biggest healthcare company in the world has some really big news on the way. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) should announce results from a late-stage study of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, JNJ-78436735, any day now.What makes J&J's results so highly anticipated is that its vaccine requires only a single dose instead of two doses as coronavirus vaccines already on the market require. This could give J&J a significant competitive advantage over its rivals.With a potentially momentous announcement imminent, should you buy Johnson & Johnson stock before the big news hits? The answer is a little complicated.Hourglass next to a dollar signIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Playing devil's advocateLet's first make the case against buying shares of J&J. Probably the most compelling reason not to plunge in now is that there's a real possibility that the results for JNJ-78436735 might not be as good as hoped.J&J's COVID-19 vaccine candidate could prove to be both safe and effective in late-stage testing, yet still fail to impress investors. Pfizer and Moderna have set the efficacy bar very high. If the single-dose regimen of JNJ-78436735 doesn't at least deliver efficacy of 80% or higher, I suspect the vaccine could be seen as a disappointment.Keep in mind, also, that Johnson & Johnson has committed to selling JNJ-78436735 at cost during the pandemic. Even if the vaccine passes its late-stage testing with flying colors, it's going to be a while before J&J's bottom line receives a boost. J&J's sheer size also works against it. Successful late-stage results for a COVID-19 vaccine would provide a major catalyst for smaller biotech stocks. However, Johnson & Johnson generates more than $80 billion in annual revenue already. A new blockbuster product would be nice for the healthcare giant, but isn't likely to move the needle enough to cause its shares to skyrocket.The other side of the storySure, the late-stage results for JNJ-78436735 could be disappointing. However, there are reasons to expect good news. For example, J&J reported results from its phase 1/2a study that showed neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were produced in more than 90% of participants 29 days after receiving a single dose of the vaccine. A full 100% of participants between the ages of 18 and 55 had neutralizing antibodies at day 57. This bodes well for the prospects that JNJ-78436735 could achieve a high efficacy. I wouldn't be overly concerned about J&J's decision to not make a profit from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, either. The company should have plenty of opportunities to generate significant profits over the long run from JNJ-78436735, especially if COVID-19 requires annual booster shots.But what about the argument that even positive results for JNJ-78436735 won't be enough to provide a solid catalyst for J&J's shares? My response is that it depends on the data. If J&J's vaccine has a high efficacy with a single dose, I wouldn't underestimate how excited investors could be on the news.A nuanced answerSo should you buy Johnson & Johnson stock before its big COVID vaccine news? I think the best answer to the question is a nuanced one.If you're looking for aggressive growth, J&J probably isn't going to be a great pick for you even if JNJ-7843673 is a rousing success story. However, if you're a more conservative investor, the stock could be quite attractive regardless of how good the late-stage results for J&J's COVID-19 vaccine are."
Buy PFE.Obviously.
Earnings next week. Could be a significant surprise. Dividend hike will also be significantly higher than usual. JNJ should be in the 140s soon.

"It does not matter whether or not you own $PFE, $BNTX, $MRNA, $VXRT, $JNJ. I do not work in the healthcare industry. Waiving IP protection for covid vaccines by the current US government administration is appalling. Instead of encouraging and protecting innovations, US government caters to the pressure from other countries by giving away patents registered by private companies. As more COVID variants and potential new future pandemics arise, who will invest and take risks to innovate without IP protection?Production of COVID vaccines is a complex scientific process and requires know-how, raw materials, strict quality controls. Waiving IP protections will not lead to increased production of vaccine doses. Without IP protection, on the contrary, it will make limited availability of raw materials scarcer to source; quality of vaccine doses will drop; counterfeits will rise. This can disrupt the global supply chain in very needed vaccines required for booster shots, and further complicate and create a global health crisis.Please write to your US senators and house representatives from your State, and tell them the US government should take the leadership by being right instead of being popular."

"""Only lets investors get in cheaper that can not afford the present valuation""I think that part of the equation was more important back when brokers charged outrageous commissions.I remember buying 200 shares of Best Buy at around $27.00 a share, back in 1993.Pretty sure the commission was $120.00. That was .60 per share & with the same .60 when I sold, the stock would have to go up to $28.20, just to cover the commissions.Today I could buy 200 shares of Best Buy and only pay $4.95 in commision.There's a lot of businesses that were adversely affected by the Internet, & for most of them, I sympathize.But I have no sympathy for the stockbrokers. They priced themselves right out of business.Long JNJ since 2002"

ill buy when it dips under 110. we havent seen the bottom yet. lawyers will jump on this and file class actions
Missed my chance to snag this one back at 109. Hoping I can see the 115-120 range but with their recent news about the covid vaccine I don’t suspect we’ll see it get that low again. Fingers crossed though
The trial was the first in which plaintiffs claimed that asbestos fibers in J&J’s talc caused ovarian cancer. It relied on unsealed internal company documents detailing J&J’s alleged knowledge of asbestos contamination since at least the 1970s
Looks like the market is a little concerned about the $2 million talc settlement. Although the dollar amount seems insignificant the optics looks concerning for the thousands of other similar lawsuits for JNJ. The wall of worry continues and its holding back a stock that should be above $150.
Ashley I just want JNJ to face the consequences of there actions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.8 million people have received the vaccine in the US 6 have experienced clots (no deaths) that equates to a success rate of 99.99989655183116% and a negative effect rate of 0.00010344816884672189%. There are 328 million Americans 562 thousand have died that is a survival rate of 99.83% and a death rate of .17%. So the numbers do not justify shutting this down. How many more people will die because they can't get the vaccine as opposed to almost nobody experiencing clots? Don't get it but haven't understood almost everything regarding how this has been handled.

In comparison, the stock closed Thursday's session at $131.75. RBC kept its investment rating on the stock at outperform. The firm said it sees Q3 results "" as a catalyst for the shares and would recommend adding to positions at current levels.""The price-target boost came as RBC also raised its estimates for Johnson & Johnson's Q3 revenue and earnings per share, as well as for its 2017 revenue and 2018 revenue and EPS, saying it believes the manufacturer of health-care products will report Q3 results ahead of consensus estimates. The firm now estimates Q3 worldwide revenue at $19.35 billion, up $160 million from its prior estimate, while it boosted its estimate for Q3 EPS to $1.79 from $1.75.RBC also sees an upward revision to 2017 guidance as likely. It expects Johnson & Johnson to reaffirm constant-currency revenue growth guidance of 5.5% to 6.0%, but also sees the company raising its guidance for reported revenue amid further weakening in the US dollar since Q2 results. For EPS guidance, RBC is predicting an increased range of $7.18 to $7.23 versus the current guidance for $7.12 to $7.22.The firm said it expects Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical segment to drive upside to current Street estimates for Q3 amid ""superior prescription trends for several large brands."" It noted its analysis of QuintilesIMS data shows prescription growth for most major brands accelerated in July and August.For the company's medical-devices and consumer segments, RBC expects ""modest"" organic revenue growth. In medical devices, the firm highlighted that ""a few businesses are doing well (e.g. electrophysiology, advanced surgery, vision care), a few are performing in line (e.g. orthopedics, excluding spine) and a few others are struggling (e.g. spine, specialty surgery)."" It noted recent hurricanes could also put negative pressure on the surgical franchises.In the consumer segment, RBC said beauty and over-the-counter products are the primary growth drivers, while the other product categories including baby care and oral care are under pressure, especially in the US. ""Management expects new products should lead to better performance in both segments, but the improvement may not be evident in 3Q,"" the firm said."

Jnj is trading ex-dividend today.Payday is only about two weeks away.I know it's irrational but I always get excited about jnj'share payday.
Such deceit and underhanded garabage. Only 66% effective against getting the disease!!! So they now try to bill it as 95% effective against severity of disease after you get the disease from their low 66% efficacy against the disease! Wow! I don’t feel all warm and fuzzy about this one. Of course you have Fauci running things so anything is possible. Why is he still working ? He’s 80 years old for god’s sake! Doesn’t he have any hobbies? Grandchildren to play with? Oops I forgot. He’s still working because he is the highest paid government official to the tune of $417k a year. He’s content feeding off the government test!
All JNJ investors welcome to Boeing stock
"Would you go Pfizer or moderna, considering 95% vs 66%? Ask yourself please?"
"Buy on weakness ......JNJ has most upside here, soon as vaccine is approved.They have capability to mass produce more then any other Co."
"Bad timing for JNJ, they shoulda released data two days ago instead of today.Long term JNJ could probaby rise. Long term, this vaccine seems better than the other two, but not the third?Question is will JNJ bounce on Monday?"
"This is the vaccine I would get, only because it does not use that mRNA, dna stuff way safer.don't own the stock but maybe today....vaccine did not help Pfizer stock ay all??"

"Just a theoretical queastion: How hard would j&j be hit if the US adopted health system like western europe? The US has the highest medical cost of all if am not wrong? I know j&j is an international company with revenues all over the world but they still make a lot in the US. I know for a fact that my country Norway pays far less per dose of medicine than americans because we dont buy them individualy. The health system buys them by the truckload and there is no laws against pressing pharma companies for lower price. For your information: I am long J&J and think its a fantastic company. I also think an older western population in addition to growing africa will benefit j&j. On a personal note I would say the US as a country and 90% of the people would benefit by public healthcare. I know many americans dont agree, but thats another discussion."
It's sort of comical that the shorts are trying to wish the stock to drop after an overwhelming win for J&J. This stock is a bargain at something like 14X earnings. GL to all longs.

During the J&J vaccine trial nobody got sick went to the hospital or died. Not on patient.
"In order to garner broad acceptance a review process must be evident. Purposeful delay to not looked ""rushed."" One shot that purportedly eliminates your chances of hospitalization and death is the real game changer."
"Specifically, the FDA’s review found fluoroquinolone antibiotics can increase the occurrence of “rare but serious events of ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta,” noting an aortic aneurysm can lead to “dangerous bleeding or even death"
Think politics/fake news a lot of people were waiting for the JnJ single shot and not taking the Moderna or Pfizer￼Something had to be done before Moderno and Pfizer shot got wasted or spoiled￼

"I don't trust MRNA and PFE efficacy rates. This the reasons as scientists noticed:The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with the coronavirus, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger the first analysis of their data.Early in the trials, infection RATES WERE LOW. With a surge in infections around the globe in October and November, trial participants became infected more quickly. So, if MRNA & PFE get the data after November, they will see the efficacy of much much lower. That's the reason AZN came out with lower efficacy."

Talc is made from magnesium silicate which is a clay. Asbestos also comes from soil. Trace particles are naturally there and have always been. Shakespeare had something when he said “Kill all the lawyers “.
"Penn State ran a story in their alumni magazine, how the WHO needs to stay funded by the US.Nowhere did they mention that the WHO helped us get infected, when they told us what China told them to tell us, that the virus did not go person to person. No doubt there are many PSU professors on the China payroll, just like Texas, Harvard and the NIH, etc. Remember how a PSU economics professor said US tariffs on China would be bad, but said nothing about China tariffs that had been on US goods for years. Wonder what the PSU economics professor is saying about China now taking money from their banks."

What if you have a group of 1000 people take a vaccine which is 67% effective (and almost 100% effective against intensive healthcare) ... how will the virus spread? The virus will not spread like it does now and the group becomes more protected.And what if that group is not 1000 but 1000 000...

"The lies people weave. Just a couple of days ago we heard over 1 million JNJ vaccines were halted due to contamination related issues. Now we learn JNJ vaccines may be contributing to blood clots in groups whose age is from 18 years old to 45 years old. The medical profession, FDA, is so corrupt and protects large companies at the risk of harmg others. So many peopel probably knew there was this low probsbility risk but issued teh vaccine anyways. Halting the over 1 million doses is a clear indicator of the relationship to blood clots. The events are separate by time to avoid any possible links but this is so obvious and probably so nad they had to act quickly. When media and politicans duck for cover like we see here it is no wonder why there is so much corruption and people who are paid off to turn the other way."

They along with my 10 grandchildren use JNJ powder to this day. Oh, I know have 4 grandboys thank god.So let me understand this lawsuit. The lawyers collect the majority of the settlement in all cases that may go to court and win some money.. The 14,000 people who wan't some money may receive some of the settlement, if there is any. Then the appeals process starts, and will take many years to collect anything. My understanding, if these suits go on for a few years, the legal fees will balloon, and as they do the legal fees will take the majority of any settlement from the 14,000 who are truthful and not some people who slip and fall at Walmart's, alwayslooking for a quick buck. In the end, if they win any money, it will be a penny on the dollar."

In J&J's third-quarter ended Sept. 30, Zytiga sales rose 43.2% from a year ago to $958 million, making it the company's third-highest selling drug. Jennifer Taubert, worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals at J&J, said in the company's post-earnings conference call with analysts while the company was ""pleased"" with Zytiga, ""we're absolutely not dependent on it,"" according to a transcript provided by FactSet. The company said total pharmaceutical operational sales growth was 8.2%, but if Zytiga was removed, growth would have still been a ""really strong"" 6.6%. The stock has still gained 4.6% over the past three months, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF (XLV) has slipped 1.7% and the Dow has lost 4.6%."
Can it go to $130 and stay above $130?
"it needs 70% immunity to achieve herd immunity for a given population.so it is a simply math:you just need to vaccine 75% of the population with BNTX to achieve a 95%X75%=71% herd immunity.you need to vaccine the 100% population to achieve 100%X70% =70%herd immunity, so using J&J is not only impossible to achieve a population herd immunity, it creates a population of 30%X70%=21% ineffective immunity who will bring risk for more spreading. its CDC's role to stop using J&J for good since it defeats the goal of total immunity quickly."
"Strong dollar does not change the under lying strength of J&J diverse business - improved outlook, increased dividend etc... share price should be 130+ and not stuck down in low 120s"
"'I still believe $JNJ will drop $GERN imetelstat. I guess we wait for later this month to see if I'm right or wrong. Nothing today changes my bearish view. If anything, NOT focusing on imetelstat today is a negative.'-Stat's Adam Feuerstein Tweets"
Old news reposted?

"I bought at 3$ higher sold a few days ago , bought back. Holding up like a champ J&J isawinner today, all other stock sink crazy!"

Read official response. This verdict will be thrown out.
JNJ vaccine will be approved in JAN so I am in @153.55 with 400 shares.
Buy JNJ dips is phi beta kappa move

"I'm not very good with charts.. Can a chart person please help. If you look at a one year chart for JNJ, it looks like a cup and handle is forming.. Does anyone else see this? Positive or negative? opinions? Thanks!"
JNJ may have the solution to this virus.
Can any attendee request an update on imetelstat oncology progress and future please ? TIA
Someone is in for a surprise when they realize how few employees they have here.Look at $JNJ now....going to leap forward. IMO
Yesterday's decision to overturn the $417 million jury award for the talc case may prove to be a significantly positive turning point for JNJ.
I am all for jnj but I believe we will retest support line at 150 ish
JnJ's vaccine will be approved within days and the price will pop again. This one shot vaccine is more convenient for children and has lasting effect much longer than others and most importantly no allergic reactions.
"I have just read the Reuters article published today the 9th April. regarding jnj's marketing of baby powder to minority groups. Nothing apart from contrived innuendo it is pathethic!!!talk about reaching,this piece by Reuters is offensive."
"will y'all look at the 5 yr chart please. every time JNJ trades above 140, it sells off. 7 times it got over $140 and each time they sell it off. something hits the news tape and they bang it. uncanny how it happens..."
Anyone else a member of (http://propick.uno)? They just mentioned JNJ.
"Red0141just asking. does anyone know why the stock is down , again, today. it's down 6 bucks in 2 days. seems like ""someone"" wants out if a bad way.thanks"
what is the delay here? Why there is not approval news?
JNJ SHOULD BE UP 4 on the news that they’re received FDA approval!!!!
"Good morning everyoneLadies and gentlemen, what good is a2% dividend if JNJ's potential liability is up to $377 Bil , assuming the remaining 13,000 plaintiffs receive a similar $29 mil payment ?There are significantly more undervalued bio-pharma growth stocks out there with pristine balance sheets, robust pipelines and a plethora of positive near-term catalysts to invest in.MTNB "
"BUY BUY BUY, holding around 2,000.000 in JNJ. STRONG and FIRM"
Net sales dropped 1.3% to $20.56 billion but still came in above analysts' expectations of $20.29 billion.
Just heard a young man in Ft. Lauderdale area had the JNJ vaccine shot and one day later is in the ICU with signs of brain hemorrhage.
"Wow, div is paying 2.8% now. Nice increase in dividend."
"They have good floor wax, idk about the vaccine"
"This stock is too easy, just load the boat on fake dips and you’ll make money the next day when it recovers"
What a #$%$ stock. Same price it was 3 years ago.
"JNJ is failing the technical besides losing a few drugs. Mid BB is sitting at $138.61 and JNJ cannot pass it. Overall, technical is going negative and low $134 (Low BB and also 50 DMA) is the current support."
First of the month. Another DRIP purchase waiting in the wings.
once jnj vaccine approved bang major game changer.
Like clockwork. JNJ seems to always go up on DRiP investment day.
"Well folks, coming this Thursday after 10 am we'll learn about any dividend increase during their annual meeting. GLTA."
"If there are a few certainties in this world, then JNJ dividend increase this month is one of them."
We’re in pace to have more outstanding lawsuits than shares outstanding.
"Way to little discussion about J&J here, why?"
Hold it guys. I worked for JNJ and I can tell you they employ the best and the brightest from all continents to do research and come up with products to cure disease and aliviate pain and suffering. The is not a bone nor structure in any of the pharmaceutical companies to cause intentional harm to a human being. To say such things here because u short the stock degrades yourself. Addiction is a terrible thing. The State in polite language can request money from whoever has it to help control addiction. I can write a book but don't have time for for u guys here.
"With the bull market having peaked apparently, it’s unlikely J&J will move up in the near future. I expect some profit-taking at this point. If the stock goes back down to 130, I’ll buy."
"Seems like a good gamble to buy before the verdict. If it goes in J&J's favor, got to expect a 5%+ bounce. If it doesn't, but ruling soft still goes up. If negative ruling, short term bounce followed by a lot of noise out of highly paid JnJ lawyers, and a long, slow appeal. IMHO"
Meltdown getting real yet?
Sold half my shares . This is heading much lower. Ill buy back under 120
"Ha ha, no asbestos found in the same bottle, it's gonna rocket"

"Six out of 6.8 million shots given. All women between the ages of 18 and 48. Now it's looking like at least some of them were on birth control which also causes blood clots. Between 300,000 & 600,000 people in the United States develop blood clots every year. What's going on here is called making a mountain out of a molehill."
"The real market for the JNJ vaccine will be worldwide distribution. Easy to produce, easy to transport, very inexpensive."
"Not to worry, just a wee bit correction today"
touched 133.69
So will J&J get gov money to develop a vaccine?
"Wow, I didn’t this we would see these levels again. JNJ the dividend stalwart bluest of the blue chips is not going to go away. Where will you put money in this low (no) interest if not in these safe yielding stocks. If you have dry powder, back up the truck."
"Riddle me this Batman. For the sake of argument if Janssen has to discontinue their shot and you took their shot before the ""pause"", what happens going forward since now PFE & MRNA are saying you'll have to get a booster shot within the next 6-12 months. If PFE & MRNA are already saying the EUA shots will need a booster what happens if Janssen has to pull their shot indefinitely? No booster and I wouldn't think it's advisable to get a booster shot from a different manufacture than the one that manufactured the shot you originally got."
"ATHENS, Feb 5 - The leaders of Denmark, Austria,the Czech Republic and Greece have urged the European Commissionto act quickly to secure supplies of the COVID-19 vaccinedeveloped by U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson.In a letter addressed to Commission President Ursula von derLeyen they said they had been informed that the new vaccineneeded to be shipped to the United States for filling andfinishing.""If this could risk EU access to the vaccines, we shouldconsider addressing the issue already now with a view to findingsolutions with the company in order to safeguard Europeansupply,"" they said.They said they understood capacity was available in Europeto perform filling and finishing, a late stage in themanufacturing process that covers formulating the licensedactive substance and filling it into vials.The letter comes as the Commission has faced criticism forits handling of the vaccines issue and for a damaging row withAnglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca. European Unioncountries have so far lagged far behind others such as Israel,Britain and the United States in rolling out vaccines.Describing Johnson & Johnson's single-dose shot as a""potential game changer"", they said it was important to engagewith vaccine producers ""to mitigate potential problems beforethey arise"".""In view of the importance attached to these issues, wewould encourage an early dialogue at the highest levels."""
"This is going to prove to be hoax. Highly likely a few hundred counterfeit bottles made in China got into the pipeline and some ended up in the US. In fact, the fact that the container in question is a counterfeit could be announced tomorrow AM and the stock could open at 135. JNJ is one of the more ethically run and revered American companies and brands and nothing has changed. They just announces fantastic earnings. We are heading to 150."
Despite buy backs and buy recommendations yesterday it turned down. Stock is in deep trouble with literally tens of thousands of lawsuits
JNJ has based here and now is the time to buy. MM's are buying here for the long term and great entry point after the asbestos collapse.
"cup with a handle formed, bullish to $150?"
They've had to pause their COVID-19 vaccine trial
"Amazing that someone can sue a company that makes a medication that keeps us all safer and healthier. Imagine the gigantic number of people whose disorganized, dangerous, potentially violent thoughts went untreated. Every atypical antipsychotic has the risk of causing breast tissue growth. It’s listed in the package insert, therefore, publicly known and unhidden.J&J gets attacked because more people used their brand than the others (Zyprexa, Seroquel, and others). It was used more because it was more effective and safe than the others for most needs/concerns. There is ALWAY a risk to benefit ratio to consider when putting anything in your body. J&J has the deepest pockets in an industry that has no friends in the media or government (same entities these days) to stand up to the continued extortion by pharmacy benefit managers, attorneys, and politicians. The pharmaceutical industry has the toughest PR job in the world. Can’t defend itself because it operates at the permission of the government that uses it as a piggy bank and rallying point for angry political fuel. As the politicians look for something to anger the population into voting for them over the next several months, watch for more bullying of the industry leaders and more fear mongering over damages incurred by the very few people out of an enormous population who benefits from great medical treatments."

"Bought the JNJ shares last time at $62, don't remember when. Will consider to buy more if it drops below $130. With aging population, health care is the place to be. Current health care holdings are JNJ, PFE, CELG and GILD, like JNJ and PFE's dividend most."
What a game changer! Up 1.96% LOL
JNJ and AstraZeneca will give vaccines at no profit . Winner out of this vaccine rollout will be EBS the vaccine manufacturer. Do your dd. GL
DUD compared to rest of the market exploding
pe way too high compared with pfizer. pfizer is a stronger buy. j&j only 60 % pfizer 95 %
Buying opportunity
Sanofi said they're willing to produce 12M vaccines a month for JNJ.
"Well, some changes in the top management is encouraging but too late and not enough. Alex Gorsky has to be replaced since under his leadership many missteps happened that now they are coming to surface. 1- The management was blind to the consumer products while people were rushing to organic products. Why Whole food was going up and AMZN wanted the Whole food. Did JNJ get the signal? JNJ was still using talc and other dangerous materials. Why does JNJ baby shampoo contain any chemical that customers ignore to buy?2- In medical devices, JNJ was ignorant too. Recently, a restaurant has started to use robots to cook hamburger. Where has been JNJ when ISRG, MDT and others were developing robotic for surgeries. Well, too late for JNJ to be a follower instead of a leader. This sector involves software/electronic/hardware that are changing fast. By the time any design gets approval by slow and budget focused JNJ, the system parts are obsolete. This is software, electronic and hardware that is fast lane and almost things changes every 6 months to a year. Some medical devices require constant changes that don't match JNJ slow system since JNJ mentality is drug development that takes years but medical devices needs fast decisions and constant changes. No needs for paper pushers in this sector but constant designs and innovations with no restrictions. 3- In biotech, JNJ was acting so conservative that ABBV came and stole PCYC from hands of JNJHow many other opportunities were lost?"
"add 100 shares, waiting for breaking out. JNJ is one of the best blue chips even without potential of covid vaccine."
"Just read an article regarding JNJ: ""The venerable Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is so large that it has multiple domains of expertise in which its drug development pipeline has paid off over time. Between its collection of three medicines for pulmonary hypertension and its six ongoing clinical trials to expand their indications, it's no surprise that the company's disease segment earned $2.6 billion in 2019 alone. Likewise, Johnson & Johnson's portfolio of four oncology drugs brought in 8.6% more revenue in 2019 than 2018 as a result of a number of growth-oriented clinical trials. Management is also skilled at getting its drugs approved in international markets. The company operates with equal proficiency in the U.S. and the E.U., and its sales in the Asia-Pacific region remain strong, growing by 4.9% last year. When paired with its aggressive indication-expanding trials, J&J's international expertise is a key component of its growth engine. It also helps the company to hedge against economic downside risk, as its geographical segments are unlikely to be contracting at the same rate at the same time."""
"No hospitalizations, no deaths, one shot. We're looking for herd immunity here, where do I sign up. Logistically this is easier than any of the other vaccines available."
JNJ inferior vaccines will cause lots of adverse events as AZN vaccines. Go away JNJ vaccines. The vaccines are for 3rd world only. Cheap and inferior
JNJ vaccine will likely boost its EPS meaningfully.
Article out today that MODERNA AND Pfizer..Both have incidents of blood clots of 4 per million ...so it appears that unfortunately like most medicines there are going to be rare instances of bad outcomes. I think that birth control pills show risks of increased blood clots in 3 out of ten thousand to put it in perspective
"JNJ Vaccine Results - EXCELLENT\ NOT!!""""Dr. Scott Gottlieb on Friday cheered the results of Johnson & Johnson?s Covid vaccine trial, telling CNBC he believes they bode well for the U.S. fight against the pandemic."""" This is #$%$ Overall effectiveness 66% ??? WHEN NOT COUNTING ALL THOSE WHO GOT INFECTED DESPITE BEING VACCINATED! IT's 66% if you exclude people who got infected but showed mild symptoms that requires no medical attention - dang! A lot of people got very mild reactions after getting infected even without being vaccinated! What am I missing?IMO The whole purpose of a vaccine is to prevent infection and by that measure JNJ failed - DON""T give me a JNJ shot - I want $MRNA or $PFE shots! JNJ results is no better than Sinovac's - murky!"

"BEVERLY, Mass., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioVie Inc. (BIVI), a clinical-stage company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative drug therapies for liver disease, announced today that it has achieved 50% enrollment of the patients in its open-label Phase 2a clinical study of BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin) for treating refractory ascites due to advanced liver cirrhosis.Penny Markham, PhD, BioVie Chief Scientist, stated, “The patients we are targeting for BIV201 therapy are desperately ill and experience a miserable quality of life. Absent liver transplantation, their outcomes are very poor. We are pleased to be working on developing a novel drug candidate that could potentially improve their future.”BioVie is conducting a mid-stage (Phase 2a) clinical trial of its Orphan Drug candidate, BIV201 (continuous infusion terlipressin), which has FDA Fast Track status and US patent protection. This compound represents a potential new treatment for thousands of patients suffering from ascites and other life-threatening complications of advanced liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, NASH, and alcoholism. The initial disease target for BIV201 therapy is ascites, which is a serious complication of advanced liver cirrhosis. The FDA has never approved a drug specifically for treating ascites. The active agent in BIV201, terlipressin, is approved for use in about 40 countries for the treatment of related complications of advanced liver cirrhosis but is not available in the US or Japan.Undervalued at $0.03 per share."

What? Why is it going down again? It gained a few pennies yesterday and it is losing a dollar today. If this trend continues and if the market act this way then we are going to see zero. Fire and replace this management. They lost their touch and they are behind of technology and vision.

"The company that has the most to gain by buying out GALT is Merck. Why? Because the combination with keytruda and GR-MD-02 4 mg for treating melanoma makes keytruda twice as good in 1/8 the time with huge safety improvements.

Also the FDA approved GALT GR-MD-02 for the start of phase 3 for the treatment of Nash. All GALT have to do is repeat phase 2B performance in phase 3."
Crazy overreaction. Buyback will be starting soon.
I bought the other day at $129.10. What do you think?

"$JNJ market cap lost more today on the blood clot news than what the acquisition price of $VXRT would have been.. imagine what the hit to market cap would be if they go ""Oops we need a booster"" later this year.. makes absolutely no sense for them to not spend the $ on risk mitigation and hedging.. plus it could be the holy grail.. seems like a no-brainer"
"Here is the Million Dollar question will there be profits? just because J&J is the latest name out in the Vaccine developments. And that will be seen Q1 Q2 Q3?And I think the jury is totally out on this.

"Nice more up today - next will be actual approval on Friday and then to come approvals for the EU, approval for global use from the WHO and then 2nd does Phase III results in May, highly likely strong Q1 results beating expectations again etc... As long as the lawsuit situation with talc and opioids can remain contained then we should see a steady improvement to $180 by June. Looking at the coming months then shorts will be completely wasting their $$ with JNJ - this is not going down anytime soon."
"It is absurd to assert JNJ would allow asbestos in Baby Powder. Talc and Asbestos are found in similar geological deposits. They figured out over 100 years ago how to tell them apart. JNJ is the target of ambulance chasing lawyers, because they have one of the best balance sheets in the world."

"Nov. 25 2016J&J confirms it is in talks to buy Swiss biotech Actelion.J&J and Actelion have made it official. The pharma giant is involved in talks to acquire the Swiss biotech, which had a market cap of $16.4 billion, before word of the buyout talks first surfaced in Bloomberg.“There can be no assurance any transaction will result from these discussions,” notes J&J $JNJ , which could easily require a 50% premium to complete a deal like this.CEO Jean-Paul Clozel, who split away from Roche to establish the company, a specialist in pulmonary arterial hypertension, has spent years pooh-poohing talks about a potential buyout. But Actelion (SIX: ATLN) has also been a constantly cited takeover target for the likes of J&J and Sanofi, which would be attracted by rising sales for new products Opsumit and Uptravi, which have come online as Tracleer revenue has begun to fade.“We at Actelion–the board of directors, the management, the employees–are all building a company and not thinking about being sold the next day,” Clozel told Bloomberg back in the spring. “If we want to continue to create shareholder value, the best for us is to remain independent.”J&J management, which has its own reasons for paying top dollar for the company, may persuade him otherwise."

"OK attorneys stated that JNJ convinced doctors that addiction was not a concern and that more use of opioids would solve the problem so just increase the dose. That's the claim they used as JNJ marketing tool. I call BS. Just because a company makes a product doesn't mean they are liable for a person addiction. Many addicts do whatever is needed to get their drug of choice whether it be drugs (legal or illegal) food, alcohol, cigarettes etc. I can't imagine this holding up in an appeal court."

"""The truth is that many parents would rather chew glass than use Johnson & Johnson products on their children [right now],"" Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Patriarch Organization and Chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, told Real Money. ""That reputation applies beyond talc too."""
"5 Reasons Imo why you should consider buying PGNX. PGNX already has two drugs approved by the FDA. Imo, PGNX is currently undervalued at $5.25 PS.Relistor which is showing 41% sales increase year-over-year. Should receive 10 million dollar milestone payment soon.Azedra recently approved by the FDA, which is expecting estimated sales of 200 to 300 million dollars plus per year in the US, plus patients coming to the US for treatment. Azedra has been proven to save lives.PyL phase 3 for prostate cancer imaging is expected to start by end of 2018, based on PyL positive trial results, PGNX very optimistic opinion and the FDA fast concurrence & decision to move to phase 3.Data from compassionate use of I-131 1095 indicates it was well tolerated and demonstrated markedly reduced PSA levels and bone pain in a group of heavily-pretreated advanced prostate cancer patients following a single cycle of treatment. “We are pleased, following our discussions with FDA, to move this important therapeutic agent into a phase 2 study in combination with enzalutamide in chemo-naïve patients with mCRPC,” stated Vivien Wong, Ph.D., Executive Vice President Development at Progenics."
"JNJ should be run out of business! They slow down and impede real cancer cure research, and spread cancer to their product consumers."
Why is Yahoo Finance showing JNJ has no dividend?
So let me get this straight a jury of our peers that's normal people like us decide the Johnson & Johnson's baby powder and Talcott cause overian cancer and you guys don't believe people like us but believe in the big giants of a multibillion-dollar drug company is that what I'm getting?
"Nobody listen Adam F. anymore this twitter post nothing look his voice now- ,, but my compassionate side hopes I’m wrong,, (Flimsy Adam Tweets:I’m confident $JNJ is going to drop $GERN but my compassionate side hopes I’m wrong. If I’m right, there’s going to be a mass-casualty incident on the $GERN StockTwits board. You’ll be able to see it from space.) no more 100% JNJ is going to drop $GERN... this message to SHORTS , sorry guys maybe Im Wrong ....."
JNJ will get crushed under new tax law.. 50% run overseas..
Monday morning you won't be able to touch JNJ for under 168.00
"$ABT or $JNJ have not even released a vaccine that has been approved by the FDA. Market manipulation at its finest, this is the real stimulus package."
JNJ is a terrible company; I am a long shareholder but recently threw the towel and sold all my shares and bought Pfizer a much better company with better prospects
"what a racket. make nice contributions to the left. help enable irresponsible behavior. sit back, and wait for millions of people needing drugs and surgery because of that behavior. and you thought the left was in favor of people doing irresponsible things. no. they just help push it to reward their donors."
Timber watch out falling stock
Sue for farting is next
Congress needs to look into the relationship with the FDA and Johnson and Johnson is why it so easy they get their drugs approve so quickly.
“What day is it today... I’m confused... don’t eat snow.. paper route.. my dementia is kicking in again”
The human trolls are out today. Of course they were no where to be found yesterday. Just shows how easy it is to be present and absent so quickly in todays behind the keyboard world we live in. GL to all longs. JNJ is a very resilient company.
will test 2014 low soon
JNJ.OTC
Good volume
bye bye140.00
I know the ex dividend is today. Does anyone know what date you can sell to keep the dividend?
jnj will crumble soon as well
$127 haha
To those talking about how great it is and congratulating each other for being so smart investing this. I posted this to Steve who bragged about making lots of money here and saying he doesn’t believe the lawsuits “Of course you don’t believe them :) you are paid to look the other way. Your financial interests would be threatened. It’s a the story as old as time why humans have mental justified to themselves participating in all sorts of horrendous acts.From the holocaust to the soviet purges.”
Will we have another Gorsky day?
"JNJ with the momo, lol, don't see that often.. The catalyst was the courts telling the talc lady you can't blame JNJ, should have known not to put baby powder up your kootchie for years..."
JNJ make not take profit on actual vaccine but they will on all other aspects tied to it. Like construction: underbid then make money on the change orders.

"It is a fact, JNJ tried to strong-arm the CDC official to accept small trace of asbestos in the baby power, to be acceptable: this was done by attempt to force the official to accept increase amount and present of asbestos in baby powder as acceptable and legal.JNJ own internal memo show their baby power is their ""holy grail' product when it come to TRUST.What will customers now think of JNJ when they cheat, lie, deflect legit responsibility when it comes to our CHILDREN? For God-sake, we're talking about BABIES and MOTHERS!Soon you will see the CEO of JNJ on TV claiming that the product is safe, and there is no liability - even after they lost the legal battle. It is very similar to ENRON : they also deflect, deny, lie, and demonize their own employee who expose their scam. You have been warned not to get anywhere close to this stock - just as the ENRON fools who also drove-up their truck and loaded up when the stock was $75/share.Like G. Bush said ""read my lips"" - this JNJ company will go to the DOGS!"
"stay short.....................130.00""s soon"
asbestos again?
Charles and jnj is being accused of lying so you're saying the also were lying about the strategic decision you are saying on your post that Johnson & Johnson said that they stepped away from imetelstat because it was bad science. This quote never came from jnj unless you are making false statements. Is this correct? Unless you are lying also.
On CBS nightly news it was stated yesterday the JNJ vaccine was approved and millions of doses were ready to be shipped on Monday. What going on here. The stock is going down and the vaccine additional approval. Is it fake news again?
Premarkets already down :) good start for today
Serves them right. Hope it drops another 15 on Monday. Screw JnJ
Nervous holding your long position? You should be.
I hope you drop 50pps that’s for backing out of GERN. Comes around goes around!!

"$123.00 Strong buy - $138 Buy - $152 risky (on possible break out, but risky)Hope the vaccin trial brings great succes!- I don't own JNJ currently -"
Jnj just got approval
imo strong sell
JNJ was a standout and a safe stock in the middle of this stock selloff. This Zytiga news now throws a monkey wrench into this. We will have wait and see how this shapes up over the next few weeks. I am sure JNJ's legal team and Government relations machinery has a few tricks up its sleeves. If you are in it for the long haul you will be okay.
It is because the whole market knows that they are sitting on information that should have been disclosed to shareholders long ago.
The following is an interesting twist!:https://uk.news.yahoo.com/exclusive-j-js-own-expert-101552267.html
that's 2015
I can't decide who is more incompetant. Gorsky at JNJ or Frazier at Merck!

ABIO needs a good look by J&J. In my opinion. :-)

Why JNJ did not make a lot of vqccine?

"Woody, sell the NY Jets you such as a football team owner as well"
"Johnson & Johnson plans to sell the vaccine at cost, at least during the first phase of the pandemic. The company says the price will not exceed $10 per dose—which is substantially lower than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which are being sold at profit. It’s unclear what that will mean for the company’s profitability in the short term, if anything, but the reputational gain of producing a successful vaccine candidate may be significant, as it has been for other drugmakers. “How many people knew who Moderna was before now?” And remember, unless you are a politician, you have NO choice what vaccine you will receive."

"The smart risk takers who owned GERN, bailed after JNJ backed out. The only ones left are the dreamers who cant face their mistakes. If you dont learn from your mistakes, you are destined to repeat them. This is why Wannabe Walter is so bitter...he never learns, and never wins...with investments or in life.

After this pull back it will prob hit 140 next or close to it

"The Board of Directors and Gorsky need to be replaced. Repeated systemic failures everywhere. In Risperdal (mass fraudulent marketing) resulting in an 8 billion dollar fine and possible a criminal deferral, in Oklahoma it was found by a Republican and Morman Judge (generally conservative) to have pushed Opioids on ""pill mill "" doctors and additionally to have mass marketed Opioids fraudulently which undoubtedly killed people from overdoses, and finally denying their own internal memos that say asbestos is in baby powder, continuing to sell baby powder with asbestos in it. It only pulled it when the FDA confirmed that it contains asbestos. What a bad example of corporate ethics and behavior. This is perhaps the most evil corporation in the history of our country. It is clear that Johnson's management does not care about anything but money. If they kill some drugs addicts or cause boys to grow breast, or kill babies with asbestos powder they don't care as long as they keep their big houses and big bank accounts. Shame on them."
"Its a good idea to require companies to disclose their pricing for drugs.They should also be required to disclose the percent of users who have suffered major side effects, or died.IE 25% of all users develop TB, 10% get kidney problems, 1% die, etc etc.Drug companies are inherently evil. They need exposure to light. Lots of light."

Honestly I thought for sure IA would be released today ahead of tomorrow's Q3 confrence.
JNJ should buy EXEL.
Overall I think we will see upside for JNJ in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? google awesome-STOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
I might start buying at 113 support.
stop the BS...can you imagine size$ of damages if a jury was involved? Other cases may very well be jury trials! Pursue just offered $12B to settle actions! JNJ should assume that amount of $$ if it litigates future suits!

Let's see if this stock can break 140 after a good earning report. Doubt it will with Gorsky. Hope people voted to get rid of this guy.
Slow Poke Johnny. Others are miles away in vaccine and the Rodrigues just saying that will try Phase1/2.
the company will coem out swinging IMO...analyst will say thsi is overblown and they knew about these lawsuits last year...Someone needs to cover a huge short imo and releases this BS
This is continued liquidation in AAA companies which is ridiculous. 1 Year from now you will be regretting selling.
People seem to forget that you will have NO CHOICE on which vaccine you get. If you manage to make an appointment you have absolutely no choice on what vaccine you will be given.
Too big to take over
Opportunity is knocking
Gotta live JandJ shareholders justifying all sorts of horendeous acts.The best part is they say “where’s the proof!?!?” And when I give it they flag the comment.Clearly scared of the truth

"The correct word to describe GALT is under valued because it is only 2% of the value of MDGL. If both companie's Nash drugs are approved, GALT will outsell MDGL because Nash has no symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage, cirrhosis of the liver. GALT GR-MD-02 Nash drug showed statistical significance in treating patients with cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices and met the objective endpoint in Phase 2B trial. Based on the new right to try law I believe GALT Nash drug can be used to treat patients with esophageal varices, which it showed moderate Improvement in HVPG and significant Improvement in cell ballooning in Phase 2B Trail. I think it's time to buy GALT, before FDA finalized phase 3 trial. DD."
JNJ says it might have a vaccine if that’s true this stock should skyrocket
Your friends at GS are giving you a gift.
Hey quick question? Do you guys brag to your families you make money from the fact that JandJ has managed to avoid paying people it have cancer to?Are they proud of you?
Socialism!!!! Sounds to me like if they want to give away vacine at cost. What about fiduciary obligation to share olders?

Who here would buy this company if there was no dividend? EXACTLY. NO ONE. LOL. Rates are better just grab some treasuries and that way you won't have your portfolio getting kicked in the face so bad. HAHAHA I love my life
"113.44 / 7.11 = 15.95 PE as today without counting other factors like debt, cash and growth ...However, JNJ is very cheap to most or all stocks in its sector when considering other factors.For example, MDT PE is 16.2 without cash-debt consideration, but MDT negative cash-debt/share consideration puts its PE around 20.With the same token, JNJ positive cash-debt/ share puts the PE under 14.Why this is matter? Most companies borrow money to buy income generated products but debt acts as a negative factor in their balance sheet. A company like VRX was traded around $265 per share with high income thru borrowed money but it did not last and now trades in $20s. JNJ is a long stable investments and dividend payments act like a fixed income assets while the chance for appreciation is very high thru share price."
imo lied about baby powder and imetelstat read below earfool imo they should be sued by gern shareholders also maybe I will contact a lawyer to look into this ...
When will this useless board split the stock already?
Is this gonna take off today since trump mentioned it
JNJ is down 4.92% to 125.31
Those put options folks got baked the last 2 weeks. Trolling a Yahoo conversation page has never worked. GL to all the JNJ longs that hung in there and added to your position.
I believe this stock is a loser. Has been trending down from jan. There is a good chance this company will be in the doubledigits.
Vaccine #3 soon !
SRTONG SELL
Lol cash saying it’s fun for to see me lash out at no one.He literally hasn’t realized I haven’t directly messaged him in days. Obsesses about me. And also announces when he’s leaving for my attention
All week the trolls were silenced and put in there place. Todays reaction is predictable. Wasn't selling if it had hit $140 not selling this year or next.

Wow thanks for the cheap shares. Added a bit more in this silly selloff.
BREAKING out soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Very predictable. Uptrend continues.
Kentucky Attorney General is sueing JNJ for being responsible for Opioid problem plus a number of brokers cut their PT on JNJ. Disaapointed in Q1 results. Pharma sales may be weaker in 2018. So now you know why today price action has taken place. I am sure they are waiting for the dust to settle and then they will go back in and buy at these lower levels. Classic stock manipulation.
I don't own this one but hoping that they report well as it's a bellwether and will help the sector and the Dow.
give the JNJ vacancies to Russia and the likes - we will keep the good stuff here
only up $6 AH
I hope Johnson Johnson has to pay every penny of that 4.7 billion dollars in more to come

"Most investors do not know that BIVI is a Nash drug for treating ascites an advanced stage of liver cirrhosis. BIVI has had favorable Phase 2 trial data and has applied for patents in the United States (which was approved), China, and Japan. BIVI has FDA orphan designation and Fast Track designation. Expect top-line results in June/July 2018. It has been manipulated and controlled by short players. Now that the Nash section is heating up I expect this stock to move higher. At $0.04 a share, it is probably the best opportunity in the market today. Buy, hold, and accumulate. DD."
Joe Congress should investigate the relationship between Johnson and Johnson and the FDA also how do they get the drugs approve so quickly why these other company have to wait years in years and years this can of worms are about to be opened
Heading toward flat on the year..what a turd stock
Close under $130 is very bearish like I said on Friday
Did they know it caused heart problems???
Looks like we will go past 126 and make new highs. Hope ye'll loaded up in low 110's. Enjoy the ride.
Ppbskis the baby powder lawsuits are just the tip of the iceberg
JNJ AUTHORIZED
The sad “men” supporting J and J actually make me physically ill. Defending a corporation proven to of sold asbestos laden talc because they lost a couple thousands bucks when the SP dropped.You guys are actually disgusting.
Why is jnj ok but teva getting destroyed
"All the crying tells me one thing , you’re to stupid to hold JNJ long like it should be and 2 you shorted the stock and got toasted lmao"
Hello 170s!
"Many of you seem to be unaware that JNJ is selling their vaccine at cost. It can be the greatest thing in the world, but financially speaking it will do nothing for their bottom line."
Big companies with large overseas operations / profits will get crush under new tax law.. Bring jobs back to America.. JNJ well come home and see ya at $130
$154.5 is the all time high
FACT below but imo raided
I wait for $120 and lower.
I wouldn't trust baby powder from Johnson and Johnson let alone a vaccine.
why is this going up for the last one week almost from 135 to 142 i am happy it is going up but I want understand

Just look at the cancer rate. Eveyone looking for what causes the cancers including jnj as he said in interview well maybe its as simple as looking under your nose baby powder ? Breast cancers way up also ? Is baby powder in under arm deodorant?
Way overvalued and another drug that could be abused will not help. To many law suits.
CREDO RULES !!!
Imo the real thing is the FDA and Johnson & Johnson relationship should be looked into by Congress and the Trump Administration.
"Not clear what their potential max liability is. I don't think I'd go rushing in yet. The Tylenol thing wasn't even JnJ's fault and isn't comparable. This is their fault. Its also women who buy most of JnJ's range of products , whether for themselves or for family. They will be the ones who the reputational damage will really settle in with. Expect to see this lumped in with #MeToo by some as further evidence of disdain for women. Don't think so? Thats the current climate we are in."
"Who is worried / concerned about the Presidents latest directive on opioids? I am a little worried it could be another rash of legal suits, but on the other hand it might be public relations opportunity for JNJ and subsidiaries. Either way it may impact price and availability of all opioids and some companies might find themselves pushed out of the opioid niche by economic pressure and government interference."
When this stupid lawsuit hit the Supreme Court it will be zero. Attorneys will happily still cash all their paychecks.

Trump is did more than Obama did in 8 years in 3 months are you for real dude you know how bad the affortable act is look at everybody's premiums you got to be kidding me Trump pass the right to try for drugs that aren't approved for the FDA you don't think that helps Johnson & Johnson out what world are you from dude. All these years in past presidents is China's been getting richer richer and rUnited States is getting in more and more and more debt it has to stop somewhere President Trump was voted by the citizens of the United States of America you probably voted for Hillary and probably contributed to her campaign and you're still bitter that you lost. Olde5
Wooglin is a moron. Don’t listen to that idiot
your CEO has too much talc in his shorts.

I think it will hit $124 before rallying up again.

"OK, if we stay above $120 on Wednesday, we should be OK till Friday morning.Eveyone with positive IQ will dump it before holidays."

Gorski will lead JNJ into the battlefields of the China plague. Longer than the Great Wall of China.
JNJ will break the support and $120 is in view for time being. More shaves later next week.
I don’t think there are very many that understand the drop here. Hanging tight. It will come
Are JNJ bandaids toxic? Wouldn’t surprise me. Time to clear my entire home of JNJ products that have become very questionable in terms of safety.
most certainly JNJ and Geron will be sued for their activity in Sept moments prior to the continuation decision.
What effect the class action suit will have?
why are the analysts still down grading jnj
"can anyone explain why none of these ""vaccines"" prevent covid? I thought the whole reason for a vaccine is to stop it from every taking over your body? These things sound like a new marketing for a flu shot makes no sense"
Funds and money managers don't like uncertainty.
cancer power and death pills. time to overhaul the leadership.
Hot tip: when you are a monster like the JandJ shareholder. Your only strategy and defence is indignation. You are defending one of the lost disgusting companies in the world. That knowingly sold a cancerous product it knew would be used in babies.So what you have to do is act shocked at being called a monster. Anything to distract form the fact you are morally void sub humans.
sell the news?
"hey scarlett ! call jnj and offer 10 shares of geron for 1 share of jnj ! after the laughter stops ,slowly without stammering say , ""WELL OK MAYBE I WILL TRY INCY "" do you know who dr t and I can contact at incy? or try the rest of the world ! imo"

"Who told the Feds raise rates that many times in a row they didn't raise it any time when Obama was President in 8 years I believe look it up . President Trump announces that 7,000 of are our sons and daughters are coming back from Syria you would think they would make people in the United States happy but the Democrats are complaining that it's the wrong why can't we bring our Sons and Daughters out there so they can't get murdered or suicide bombed"
"Was the cause of cancer under our noses all this time , maybe that's why we couldn't find it or jnj couldn't either imo or didn't want to ... to be continued. W.w"
J&J Used To Be FUN !But Baggies Now Need toRUN RUN RUN !
Criminal charges are very much appropriate here. Unknowing consumers paid the ultimate price using tainted baby products. This POS company should be liquidated

Glad I sold .....................................

They have been proven in the courts of law their products caused cancer and need to pay up now!!#!
Bad headline but the liability should be limited.
I am boycotting all of J&J products because they support the radical liberal terrorist network CNN. It is that simple. Fear the media lies and punish the company's who support the terrorist liberal media.
down $1...market not taking talc baloney seriously...bunch of BS
selling all around 125
Johnson sold! You other Johnson’s are left holding the bag.
Unless imo they do some of the crooked stuff they were doing before after an update your phone would go dead to go buy a new phone they got a big fine for that one I believe

Strong reversal today. Let's continue this uptrend.
Let's get it straightSo the government says these drugs are approved then the doctor prescribes the pain medication to the patient and he or she becomes addicted. Now the drugs that the doctor over perscribed is now the fault of the manufacture. This is dumb #$%$&*!.
jnj taking a risk by ramping up production of COVID vaccine before proof of effectiveness. If successful this will be great for the world as well as JNj
"I like JNJ, they will probably drop further but I'm buying the whole way."
Down 13 out of the last 16 trading sessions. Looks like it bottomed today.
JNJ folks go check out the price target on ACHV
Someone must have downgraded the stock because all indications are the company had a great Q1. Except for some expenses net was up along with top line revenues. Very puzzeled by the morning open. I thought for a moment i had gone color blind!!!

See where the active ingredient in Pepcid is now being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19
It's so funny cuz the analysts lower your expectations the last time because Johnson Johnson said sales were going to be lower imo this cartel is not selling more you're just jacking prices on drugs that people need to save their lives
"Cancer blamed on baby powder? Now, I have heard everything..."
"let's see how far it will go down today, not good"
I'd really like a close above $150 going into the weekend.
How many of you fake investors claiming to be long JNJ got spooked out of your shares so real investors could pick them up at a pre-Christmas discount? Thumbs down only if you're a faker please.

go jnj
Great opportunity to for selling put today. The $120-130 spread for January is going for about a $125. No way this is going below $130 in a month.
"JNJ is so corrupt. Since 1957 they knew about asbestos being used in their baby powder. They NEVER disclosed it as an ingredient on the product label. For 60 years they lied, misled and induced a carcinogen in direct contact with human skin. This is about as vil as any company behavior in US History. There are early lawsuit as well citing JNJ talcum as a link to Ovirian cancer. JNJ is appealing that case which surface years ago. Now the news on asbestos comes after and it is a nightmare for JNJ. They tried to cover up in a previous lawsuit, issued an appeal and yet another source identified asbestos in their product without them disclosing this. How can JNJ be trusted ever again?"
TOO MANY LAWSUITES MORE TO COME 120 BY MAY

"I just threw away my baby powder just now, thank goodness"
JNJ could have had BSX for ~18-20B not too long ago......now the price for Stryker will be 3X that. Wish I knew how JNJ ignored a shot at BSX.
"George Budwell from Motley Fool wrote in an article entitled ""Three stocks that are insanely cheap right now"". With JNJ being one of them. Is this guy smoking crack? JNJ is at an almost all-time high! Note to self - whatever The Motley Fools suggest, do the opposite!"
look at the chart this is not going to collapse it is just ON SALE with a sharp market drop magnifying a drop....that is it...
No vaccine shot for me
Here comes $127

"Gee asbestos, who would’ve thought"
This will close green So oversold.
75% of this World will rely on a single dose vaccine which will keep everybody out of hospital as the vaccine disappears. Forget the 2 doses plus a booster in 6 months garbage.
What’s going on with JNJ? Something other than lawsuits or new information related to that?
they sell products that cause cancer then drop imetelstat that kills cancer imo jnj are the real criminals and I will join a lawsuit I want 1 million to settle after being exposed a lifetime....
"just got out, will go to 120"
They better have the goods on this one
"I know someone who participated in trial about a month ago, shot to the arm, some pain at point of shot, and slight sore throat. other than that, all is good, let's hope!"

"compared to jnj, monsanto is a virgin"
I think they will split once above $150. But with Amazon and Google not splitting with shares over $1k.....
"wow, this may be a 0 with the talc news. So bad."
I would stay away because this company is facing lawsuit for the next few months.
I laugh out loud reading this board sometimes. A few days ago someone posted “How does a JNJ vaccine affect EPS?” Imagine for a moment if there was a vaccine. Millions of small businesses are saved! Mortgagees get paid! Families are reunited! Give the damn vaccine away for free who cares about EPS

"Sold half. While I hoped for 125, it's very good profit. I will sell rest around 125 (Except profit part which like about 40-50 stock in this run). This is mostly risk free at this price but Only bad part is some stock are way inflated and when they crash it will take rest of market with it. Don't want to get stuck for long period ( I got stuck in $EWZ but luckily I only have $100k there and I think I will still able to exit with some profit very soon given how volatile that etf is & great premium for calls and puts., Here I got $180K invested right now."

"As usual, Jim Cramer = noice with little if any value. He advised yesterday to await buying JNJ for two days. JNJ has since jumped some 3%."
Time for this stock to split and time to get rid of Gorsky. He's almost as bad as Jeffrey Immeldt!
What happened?
"Dividend bragging sounds so stupid to me and maybe it is that I missing something truly profound. JNJ was at 154; heading to 2018 levels, still have the same number of unsolved legal issues, and they have already saying that sales will be down. if the unemployment goes up, then their healthcare sector will suffer too.why does a of $0.95 makes up the fact that the stock has gone down from 154 to 136? projected to drop further. Is $0.95 more than $18 so far?if you have own this stock for more than a month, you are either loosing money or lost an opportunity to buy cheaper and/or take profits out. plain and simple.you have no reason to believe anything i say and you certainly should not be listening to any pumper bragging about dividends.there are better buying opportunities ahead."
WSJ article about lawsuit will keep this a down day.
Novavax is 95.6% effective. Look it up people. This vaccine is a joke!!!
Timberrrrrrrrrr. I can see $125. Only the beginning.
"Ridiculous ruling! No personal responsibility, no liability to the doctors who prescribe the drug....Stupid! The ONLY reason for the ruling is JNJ is a big corporation with a strong balance sheet.. Sickening! I hope they win on appeal and pay NOTHING!!"
absolutely great bounce but unfortunately nothing changed in the world to justify this crazy bounce. I think it will dip down below 135 again.
Besides having an amazing dividend that is considered an aristocrat dividend JNJ is only going up in stock price

Very good outcome. Great news for JNJ. Let's see how this plays out. Initial knee jerk reactions are always overblown. The judge still rules against JNJ and that may continue to weigh on the stock. I am sure JNJ will appeal the judgement.
Where did all the big mouths go

jnj should be up more than this instead of struggling to keep a gain
Better invest in weed.
More trouble ahead? Billions to sue? never know
Cramer must own a lot of JNJ . He's the only one talking about it everyday in regards to Covid. No one else even mentions it relating to Covid. Comeon Jim do better.

david5 days agoWhy did JNJ insiders sell?Very good question David... does anyone know why? This stock has an outrageous P/E 265
we now have a president with ba&& s
I see Johnson & Johnson will spend 100 million over the next five years to promote healthy quality for black people and people of color in the United States. I guess all the white people in poverty will be S.O.L.
Enjoy complications of Covid then.
"Holding a few shares , Just because its JNJ."
"Finally back to green today - absolutely ridiculous that SP would be down given the rollout of the single dose COVID vaccine. This is all good news and investors need to look ahead to EU approval, WHO approval, global rollout and ramp up of the vaccine - the US distribution will end up being a small % of the overall business for the this vaccine from JNJ."
Hahah cash made another account. He got scared because I was ready to take real action against him

"The next week is filing for EUA. It will be back to 170s. May be that's why shorties are riding it. I don't have money to cut loss. Will wait. I have faith in this company, their research data and results."
Remember that I said get out this morning
"Oh the horror! Sell before your neighbor. Johnson might actually sell before Johnson. Johnson & Johnson will get cut in half. Future name will be Johnson.. Yup, just Johnson. Did I mention you should sell before any of the Johnson’s?I am the way."

Can it hold $135 today?I don't think so. There many small institutions and traders who are chasing and playing DIV. They usually exit on ex-div to catch another fish. JNJ today price is in their hands but it will get better in coming days. $140 is in view and JNJ will get there in next few weeks.
10 dollar drop? 20? Less than 100 soon

Who says JNJ isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? I started receiving notifications from awesomeSTO-CKS the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
Why do you think you're setting aside a hundred billion dollars for lawsuits
"Alex Gorsky, J & J 's largest individual shareholder. They used this bad stuff to benefit people like you. How will you help the people who are suffering and died ?"
"Market always overshoots to the upside as well as downside. So fully valued notwithstanding, it can still keep going up. 140 will not surprise me. People are piling on."
Oklahoma is a small state. That's why the award was small. Texas is different.
i'm very very worried
3/31 JNJ's deals with the government are cut for the visus. 2 other companies are getting the deals. JNJ wants to buy IBIO. IBIO shares will shoot.
Buy Moderna!! MRNA!!! Huge gains every day!!! The best vaccine company of them all!!! Big profits!!!! Big and huge win!!! Huuuuuge...
"An elite team of the worlds greatest doctors and researchers told the President they needed 2.5 Billion to fight corona.The liberals in Congress, who serve big pharma, passed 8.3 Billion. The left has been on the side of drugs, doctors, needless surgeries, gender change, needless vaccines, SDS's, gender fluidity, etc etc ever since Hillary was appointed by Bill to enrich them, for their contributions to his campaign. Part of our health care is badly needed. Much of it is terribly corrupt and hurtful to many many people."

"Ashley did you check this one out?????? Let me know what you thinkLevaquin Users Sue J&J for $800M for Hiding Side EffectsBy Michelle LlamasThis page features3 Cited Research ArticlesLast modified: June 5, 2018Elderly man with chest pain and wifeFive former Levaquin users filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson and its Janssen unit claiming the drug giant deliberately downplayed side effects of the medication to boost profits. The plaintiffs’ lawsuit said J&J mislabeled and misbranded the popular antibiotic, causing “significant harm and/or death to consumers of Levaquin, including plaintiffs.”In addition to J&J, the plaintiffs name additional defendants, including former FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg. The suit falls under the under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) act, the law used to prosecute organized crime. Plaintiffs seek more than $800 million, about $120 million in compensatory damages and around $750 million in punitive damages — damages meant to punish companies and discourage the same kind of behavior in the future, according to Fierce Pharma.The plaintiff’s attorney, Larry Klayman, argues that the defendants worked together to mislabel and misbrand Levaquin. Doctors use Levaquin and other drugs in the same class called fluoroquinolones to treat bacterial infections. They are popular because they treat a wide variety of illnesses from urinary tract to respiratory infections.In November 2015, the FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (ADMAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee called for a black box warning, the agency’s strongest warning, for all fluoroquinolones.The class of drugs is linked to several disturbing side effects, including tendon damage, peripheral neuropathy, heart problems and skin conditions.“We … believe our actions regarding the medicine have been appropriate, responsible and in the best interests of patients,” J&J told FiercePharma in an email.Did you suffer side effects from antibiotics like Levaquin?"
How much is JNJ worth after you back out the unethical businesses?
W.w says sell that's all I need

This has 8-10 point move by the end of July
"Actelion price is a mystery to me.Taking annual revenue and applying an average 5 multiple yields a value $9.45B market cap. Given that J&J is not getting the R&D, it's probably not realistic to use a market average multiple and a 3.5 multiple is probably fairer. Thatgives a market cap of $6.75B.However, let's throw logic to the winds and assume a massive 10 multiple. Now we get a completely irrational $19BWe're still nowhere near $30BCan anyone explain the numbers in this deal?"
I wonder if they are buying Auris due to the health ramifications of Esketamine….

Time to short
If you own jnj doesn't it make sense to own gern am I missing something here?
"Yes I agree with Edg. I work in a hospital and have been for 35 years. Doctors due become drug addicts, alcoholics, and whatever else. Doctors are not immune to becoming addicts. 18 million alcoholics in this country. This is why you should never have a surgery on Monday after the Docs are partying on the weekends. I know plenty who do. Had on anesthesiologist years ago on a Monday attempt to give a spinal block and shoved the needle into her aorta which killed her. Cost the hospital 10 million. Lawyers are the only people who make money off of any big lawsuit."
FOR all of you who bought those PUTS ! OUCH ! They will be ZERO tomorrow
If J& J has the miracle ￼vaccine then their stock will skyrocket.
I like dogs but this one right now sure has a lot of fleas. When will it start to rise again?
Great company bad times and bad stock for the foreseeable future. In this bear market all get slaughtered. JNJ will be at $100 by end of 1st Quarter. The ramifications of the law suits and pending litigation will take a toll on its earnings.
Strong sell. 
Deborah do you think this will lead to more lawsuits about the antibiotic?
"Well there are facts, and then there is rampant negative opinion. I suspect JNJ gets beat down some more, but it has made it on my radar to consider once I hear overwhelming negative bias. PE is rather high tho, even now"
We're at the same price as late 2017. this is pathetic! Do a post we may claim Bankruptcy and we may shoot to $300.
"I started following ""awesomestokcalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."

Does anyone know how many vaccines J and J currently has licensed globally? I didn’t realize they were a major player in this space.
I can see this stock hitting its low of the year. And probably fairly quickly particularly if more bad news comes out like that of today. This is not good.
Today is one of only seven trading days in the past year with less than 4 million shares traded.

I love these trolls. What a sad life they all must live. Do they really think that their toxic comments are going to have any real meaning effect on JNJ. Happy New Year to all the JNJ longs.
"We should be @ 150.00""ssssssssssssssssssssss now"
Cancer stock deserves to crash. Lol Deborah actually thinks that it’s a conspiracy and that the media only writes about when JandJ loses a case.
Tank City !
j&j comes out with more news this week?
Super cool
Quietly JNJ going with VXRT 100% vested in oral pill vaccine.
How far can this stock go? It is almost at its high and it seems like this is just the beginning.
It looks like this is turning out to be a bloodbath and not just for JNJ but for many pharmaceuticals. Will we see $120....$115.....$110.....or perhaps even lower?
is bottom forming?
Down another %. Woohoo
I don't know which stock is worse right now. T or JNJ. Both have been the worst performers in my portfolio since last year.
This old fart (me) is up 300+ percent on JNJ and with dividends paid out to me election. Yeuhoo!
Buy at 85.00
Many things we consume could be linked to cancer. i think what JNJ is saying is that there is no coralation to baby powder and cancer. My question to jurors how can you determine if baby powder itself caused the cancer. Seems impossible to make that determination. As a reslut many of these lawsuits have been overturned during the appeal process. That should tell you what you need to know.
Phara was out of favor today. Tomorrow's a new day. GLTAL.
What is the real answer on JNJ vacine? Is the company seling the vacine or giving it away for free for humanatarium reasons. The price of JNJ is dropping.
reversal? haha... wishful thinking
Another monster company posting Lower Rev's and Lower Earnings. The contraction of the global economy continues.
"OK, since JNJ is an arguably dynamic company, any speculation on who they may be interested in buying now? KMB is a revenue enhancer, but really doesn't offer any blockbuster innovative ideas?"
"Incredible how even with a rate cut by the Fed, this stock is in the red. Do we need anymore proof that Gorsky has to go! And maybe a lot of board members need to go."
Just voted my proxy to try to get rid of Gorsky. He's nothing more than the human Coronavirus of this stock!
The minute JNJ goes down a bit...like yesterday the trolls assume JNJ is going to tank. What I don't understand is how miserable these people must be with their lives to spend it spewing negative comments about a stock like JNJ. If you're short JNJ stock great. Good luck.
Another down day¥£&$@
ADIL is the next move 
Let it be...Go you.tube: one day
"The White House virus staff was notified of HCQ over 3 weeks ago. Results in 6 days they were told. 100% cure rate. Today, 3 weeks later, some tests were stopped, some in progress, some never started. Its obvious big pharma is colluding to stop this. Big pharma had big plans for hillaries victory. They've been waiting and plotting for something to happen, to steal trillions from the world. They must be stopped. They are keeping people from at least feeling better, to even helping them die. Lets get a dam test done. Its way over due. Maybe some anchor will ask when in the world will we see an overdue report ?"
He’s either lying or a sociopath. Who vehemently defends a company that it’s own memos admits it sold a cancerous product. Then says stuff like “I’ve learned in life not to blame others and take responsibility”. Lol so if a company without you knowing starts filling your food with lead and radioactive byproducts you should .just “take responsibility” lol
Added more shares today on the recent pullback!
"GALT has approved patents to support the development for treating over 20 cancers, and approval by the FDA to start phase 3 for a Nash drug, and a combination trial that makes keytruda twice as good in 1/8 the time and significantly improve safety, Imo this stock is way under value at $3.94 and should be trading more than twice its current value."
JNJ is huge and will always produce profits for people with the dividend and the GOV just announced that people should start receiving JNJ vaccine asap
No demand.Straigt down from here.

This company has no forward thinking management!

This is far from over.
J&J Plans to Appeal Staggering $1B Judgment Against Hip Implant at TheStreet
Also in my opinion just was deleted earlier is the FDA should be investigated to how does Johnson & Johnson get so many drugs approve so quickly there's got to be friends on that board there or investors something fishy going on.

Why doesn't this jump like Maderno and others with vaccine releases? should have jumped $50.
they can by back all they want but if theres more sellers it wont matter fixing a stock price imo.
Ohh creepy 70 year deb back to obsessing about my love life. Must be because at her ago its is like sticking a jello cylinder in sandpaper.At least with the alzeihmers she never remembers.
sell on the news hence short
No sympathy at all for JNJ. Let it fall. Putting other at risk for the sole purpose of greed. And they show their true colors owning the evil human killer MONSANTO!. DOWN WITH JNJ ALL THE WAY!
"JNJ should dump its talc product line. Not that it contains asbestos, it simply is not worth being associated with."
120$ come to daddy and I keep you for the whole life
Disgraceful. I hope they lose major share price and goes to hell. ASBESTOS in Baby Powder since at least 1991.
"Almost every food company, supermarket, mini market could be sued for selling food that contains miniscule residues of potentially “dangerous” plastic, heavy metals (chocolat) , arsenic (rice), etc. ￼"
JNJ will be over 167.00 before earnings
Jnj socks as baby powder least it will win l will pray cancer power del will lose
"Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in DC today, attending the March for Life.Of course some people, like Miley and drug companies, encourage bad behavior. Miley keeps her name on tabloids, sells a few more downloads. Drug companies make billions supplying drugs, other things needed with surgeries and treatments required after our young people were told that if it feels good, do it, and if you don't you are a fool, and will miss out on your life. When someone tells you to not worry about responsibility, you should knock their lights out. They want you to suffer from pain, and hurt, and unnecessary treatments like they had to go through. Do not succumb to peer pressure, or your grade school teacher, or your nutty professor in college who all want you to be like them. Be something you can be proud of. When you learn to Respect your life, you will learn to respect others. And one day, we will pay trillions less in healthcare, and we will all be happier and healthier."
Imo all of the products in question should be pulled of the shelf 's in us and the world.
Stock up on bandaids before JNJ goes under.
CRIMINAL corporation. BURN. Target: 70.
"How is Talcum Powder a thing we use around babies anyway?Talcosis: look it up.Also, look at the chemical composition of Talc and the chemical composition of the most abundant form of asbestos.Talc - H2Mg3(SiO3)4 or Mg3Si4O10(OH)2Asbestos - Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4.Pretty sure these minerals would get created in similar processes."
"Last year's low, at the end of trading day, was 111.76. This was ~ 31 dollars off of the high last year, and finished the year at 139.72. Every year that I've followed, as the stock price rose to new highs, the spread between high and low increased. Don't know if this trend will continue, however this year so far, the spread is ~26 dollars."
Let see if they take it to 150.00Get BUY orders ready.
LoL. @ CORPORATE DRUG PUSHERSNOW WHO'S YOUR DADDY!!!
Whahoooo...let's ride this wave to riches!
UPGRADED !soon we go over 200.00+++++ as new vaccine comes online.
"And....thank you for proving my point. As I said 6 hours ago, ""wannabe Walter, never learns...and never wins. So he blasts the board with nonsense gifs, angry posts, and irrelevant politics""See below how he proves my exact point...omg... this has gone from sad, to just pathetic...the saddest part is, he is too dim to even understand it...wow..just wow...Nite all..happy holidays..."
"Oh btw , fair market value is 160$ stupid not to buy 130 or sub 130"
JNJ wizzzed fifty billion dollars down the drain.
JNJ is down 5.00% to 113.89
"How many of you non-essential, non-thinking, replaceable drones would line up to have gender reassignment surgery if fake epidemiologists like Fauchi went on national TV and said even though there's no real benefit or science to support the procedure, it probably would be a good idea? Discuss."
Just found out that JNJ got alerted by http://bestpix.xyz. Seems bullish
meant to put a put for next week...didnt see exp 11/22 silly me..why cant they bring back the asbestos news the last power hour...
It seems like a screaming buy lol way oversold today.
"JNJ WILL BE WELL OVER 165.00 THIS WEEK, LOVE MY DIVIDENDS"
Looks like Gorsky showed up for work today! Too bad. We were doing better as shareholders when he wasvon the golf course!
BK Coming!!
Nice clip at the end to once again finish red!! What a turd
new litigations coming in next week
Uttely disappointing. It gets killed with market down 3% and then does not recover even half way when market is up 8%
If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on JNJ before rallying up. Im not sure about you guys but awesome-STOCKS has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
I want Johnson and Johnson but I want to pay less....
"The fed and s buying, otherwise this thing would see match lows"
I'm gonna look into buying some call options.
Another Gorsky Day coming.
Look for SILLY dips in JNJ
J n J let’s go get with the program
JNJ on sale! Will get in under 130....
"BIVI has received FDA Fast Track approval for its Nash cirrhosis of the liver ascites drug, which is currently in Phase 2A, which has shown positive results. Current price is $0.06 per share, unbelievable for a positive Nash related drug. DD.This one could make you big money."
"What a total #$%$ company. Asbestos in baby powder? And JNJ executives hid it from th public for over 4 decades. Now here is the questions to ask theirCEO: Did you know Asbestos was in your product for years? If they answer NO my mediate next questions is: What other products of JNJ have carcinogens in your products? if they say none to their knowledge then her is what I think of them. First, they lied to Americans for decades. There would be no reason to even ask the questions because whatever they say is likely to be another lie. This stock should be toxic and down even further. Thesis the evil behind the SEC. They should shut down trading until a full investigation is completed. As far as consumers know today, JNJ products are harmful and their executives cannot be trusted. Cramer is going to question the CEO tonight. What a joke. It will be soft questions to protect investors. Cramer and JNJ are pathetic. This is a horrible brand and i am sick knowing I had money in it."
Puts and shorts are paying off nicely!!
Good buy at this price
Too bad the Dow is tanking today. Otherwise we would have been up over $5.
is it true the dividends will be gone eventually?
"my IQ shares are up 10% today. Yep it offers no dividend. But I don't care! I'm up over 125% in the stock and its been 3 months lol.You all chase dividends, i do what makes me rich. Suck it to you all chasing boring old companies while I get so wealthy LOLOLOL"
The door for JNJ taking over BSX is closing fast !
JJ WILL GO TO 125 UNTIL THEY CLEAN U THE CO TO MUCH SWAMP IN COMPANY
First 100M are at cost...unfortunately covid is here to stay so this will be a revenue goin fwd
If they added on the loses from lawsuits JNJ would be losing $
"Wouldnt touch this thing. The way they are all pushing this #$%$, very suspect to me. This issue hasnt even begun to be addressed yet. The best they could do is announce a share buyback to try and stabilize the price. Theres surely more pain to come for longs."
"Frank I agree with you, the drop far exceeds the insignificant Miss in revenues in spite of earnings ahead of analysts predictions. But that's wall st for you, over reaction. GLTU."
All these JandJ shareholders justifying asbestos in a baby product and their role in the opioid crisis would of done well in #$%$ Germany justifying all sorts of horendeous acts

"Oh look, you have the joy of the wannabe Walter white. A man who idolizes a genius, who owned his own actions, for better or worse. The antithesis of this dolt, who loses all of his money in GERN. But even after JNJ pulled out there deal, crushing from 6 to 3, this mastermind keeps holding as it's about to break under a dollar today. Since he still believes, he cant badmouth GERN, so his scapegoat is JNJ. He shakes his fist furiously ALL day and ALL night on this board, so he doesnt have to look at his own stupid mistake. How UNLIKE Walter white...sad."
Will JNJ fall from all time high to 52-week low in one day?
Im back TIMBER 140
Is baby powder the cause of ovarian cancer?
Hang in there - better days coming.
pps drops. DRIP buys more at lower price. :-)
JNJ to zero. Company is going under. Chapter 11 soon. Why not lol. Love these boards lol
All you greedy morons that forgot to sell your puts and or cover your shorts can shut up anytime now. Futures up. Healthcare sector breaking out. Don’t be surprised if JNJ settles the major lawsuits right before trial. Happens all the time in the courts. Nobody wants to go to trial. Gaps down—gaps up.
"The two resident idiots, kristopher & mr walter white, will not like this one iota!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-johnson-johnson-may-not-100000896.html"
"JnJ is a very dirty company. I worked there for more than 3 years, and was the most experienced and qualified employee in the department. But, they let me go for no reason. They had people like Flora Ng, Bernie Davies, Vikash Varma etc. who were very biased and looked for their own good. All of them tried their best to hurt me. There was another guy ""Bill McKechnie"", who was good for nothing. I worked for him for a couple of years, but he never knew what he was doing. Bottomline, J&J IT is very dirty, and is not doing justice to its share holders."
only down 1.66 pre market. Thought it would be at least $3+. Still have the whole day. Down $10.00
The news articles are based of Johnson’s own memos which the judge made his ruling based on.Why can’t shareholders just take responsibility? Oh right. Because them making money depends on them being purposely ignorant and attacking cancer victims
All your 401k funds are now stuffed with all the way over priced stocks so guess who is going to get stuck with all the losers it not Wall Street it is main street again. Get to CASH before the CRASH the chats tell you it's coming

JNJ is down 8.65% to 122.67
Over 17 million stocks sold today. I may hurt today but you will be glad come monday when J&J opens below $120. Not to late to short. This thing will drop below $100.
credo of this company: bring cancer to people and make them addicts. so sad
The reason the sock went right back up at close is this is all short actionsorry shorts this stock is predicted to just go up and will be over 200.00 at earnings :)
Johnson & Johnson reached a 52 Week low at 124.82
When they report the news online this will drop more
Jnj strong sell w.w...
Why is it down today?
$128 (a few days ago) to $137 (yesterday) and today $131 on recall news - gotta trade people to capture green trading $$$
The funny thing is its not the first time they engaged in criminal activity against consumers....
Just in JNJ decided to double their share repurchase budget to 10 Billion
nice business model: selling products which bring cancer to ppl then selling drugs to cure it
"FDA are crooks, going short and disapprove drugs, even when phase 3 was very good. Other trick is supplier of ingredients has faults in its factory, now saying bad ingredients in powders....wow. Trump should change the system. Because those guys are playing Godd for a way to long period!!!"
"5 Yr chart, nothing looks bad at all. This isn't anything. Ignore the media."

How come JNJ vaccine did not work as well as Inovio vaccine?
Ashley did JnJ really have to recall its baby shampoo no more tears because it contained DIOXANE (carcinogenic) as well as EMBALMING FLUID. PLEASE Ashley let me know what you find out???? thanks (I USED THAT ON MY KIDS)
"It would suck to be a JNJ scientist right now. Yeah, they developed a vaccine pretty fast, but it is like a D- or an F compared to their competitors..."
So Charles jury says it caused cancer and a 4.7 billion verdict and that's irrational what planet are you from Planet denial and lies?
"Johnson & Johnson cant come up with a vaccine and 3,000,000 will be infected by June 1st. 5,000,000 by Labor Day! Its over folks, we are not going to escape the carnage."

"How ill someone proof he used or has been used with baby powder from J&J? Pictures? documents? people can only claim that they even used the product, and how to ptoof your cancer is from the talc???"

Lol cash has stopped directly stalking me with comments on my posts in other boards. Instead chose to be even creepier and just dislike them.I guess I will have to take action against this worm.
Geo says “it’s absurd to assert JNJ would allow asbestos in Baby Powder.”It’s in their memos for decades admitting they knew lol. I’m sorry you hate facts :s. JandJ isn’t even saying they didn’t know. They are saying it can’t be proven theirs caused the cancer. Some basic research does wonders kid :)

Has jnj already bought back 5 billion in stock??
JNJ parterned to the tune of $935 million with GERN two years and seven month's ago. During this time JNJ has made great strides in bringing Gerns Cancer curing IMET to market. Today very well might be your last chance to buy shares in GERN below $3.

"Lawyers will make a killing on this evil company, hope you guys bought enough puts on Friday"
Buy JNJ in dips! Everybody and their grandma use JNJ products. Don’t over think!
thanks for the sale price. Boolean
When you think that JNJ is good at this price or that price. Then you realize they have a decade of lawsuits to litigate and the states are desperate for cash things get a little confusing
Sell now. Thank me later. Monday things will be much worse.
And here he goes...furiously typing....wait for it....
JnJ should be looking for the MLSS of the world. Patents etc for pennys on the buck.

JnJ and Janssen are a bunch of morons for dropping a billion dollar drug from Geron! There only one other competitor and they’ll have Phase III going soon. I guess making $1-2billion isn’t enough each QT or year for them. It’s a shame it’s about how much money they have to put out and not about helping the science in fighting cancer!

Wow what a disgrace. I will never buy any J&J product again. How dare this company put our children at risk knowingly. Bring on the lawsuits.
"Well, I'll just have to hold this longer and accumulate along the way.....I have no idea what is holding stock down. Company is by far the standard (AAA rated) to which other companies aspire, yet it's treated by the market as if it's a pariah."

"If Johnson and Johnson stopped contaminating us with dangerous chemicals, we could do away with the American Cancer Society, and many other companies spending money on cures, when we know darn well what the casues are. So why do you invest in a company like this. if you made money with J& J, YOU should be sending these cancer victims a check. you own the company. they are doing what you told them."

Figures. Yesterday JNJ broke above water versus the beginning in of the year and it's down again.
"I see this as a good time to buy rn this news in the baby powder is from a shipment last year in 2018 when the news was released, so this is fear/over reaction I’m sure by nov is will be close to 140"
I head the J&J covid 19 vaccine has some bad side effects. One young mother reportedly grew a third nipple. Trials on hold. This doesn’t look good...

how a company like JNJ hid the asbestos in baby powder for years is now coming to light. It will cost them
"Maybe it's a dumb question, but how can you personally sue for this ? How do you give proof that you used it ?Even if they checked your blood, you could have gotten asbestos from anywhere."

In addition, it now sees annual sales in a range of $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion, up from $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion."

"This from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health: There is very promising news about a third vaccine that is expected to be authorized by the FDA for emergency use and roll-out across the country soon. This one-dose vaccine, produced by Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine division, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, has shown to be safe and effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID infection in a multi-country study. This means that by taking the vaccine, you would be less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to suffer moderate to severe illness or death due to COVID-19. Plus, this vaccine is a single shot which will eliminate the need for scheduling a second dose. If this vaccine does receive emergency use authorization, it is likely that it will be available for use in the United States in early March."
Nice momentum. Could take us to 150.
President trump should investigate f.d.a and jnj relationship this might open up a big can of worms and take pressure off every day everybody looking at him.imo
mrna is preparing to launch.
Maybe we did find what was causing cancer for all these years and decades maybe after all it was baby powder I'd there baby powder or do woman use it under there armpits? What I was younger I never heard of so many so much breast cancer and now it's like everyone I talk to.
Meltdown. Game Over.
More CANCER CAUSING HAIR CUTS on the way...LOL!
So J&J wins an important talc cancer case in NJ and has FDA approval to expand Xarelto treatments - then most analysts are expecting an earnings beat next week. What do we get? another red day when the market is up?? Totally illogical and quite frustrating that positive news is ignored and negative news sends the price plunging. There is no logical reason JNJ should not be steady over $140 right now.

"GR-MD-02 showed statistical significance and would have met the endpoint in Phase 2B trial for treating patients with NASH cirrhosis of the liver without esophageal varices. The FDA approved phase 3 trial, planning is currently underway.GR-MD-02 make Merck’s (NYSE: MRK) blockbuster drug Keytruda twice as good in 1/8th the time in Phase 1B trial for treating stage 4 Melanoma. Making this a must have acquisition target for any drug giant including MRK. To get into this melanoma trial, you needed to be refractory, which means that you had tried all known drugs to mankind and nothing had worked. GALT GR-MD-02 is not just a huge Nash drug but it's also a huge cancer drug. So when comparing GALT with MDGL which has a Nash drug now at $306 per share, keep this in mind. Now add in the rest of GALT pipeline. This is why I said that GALT is currently worth $60 to $100 per share and could be worth in excess of $300 per share in the next one or two years. Plus I believe buyout plans are being discussed."

I guess money can buy anything. Including a conscience and a decent human beings dignity.“But but Mac Donald’s is unhealthy!!”Yes and people know the risks. No one knew their talc would be laced with asbestos. Sorry my mistake Johnson knew.

SANP Rocket mining bitcoin pool...

First it was it’s all a made up story. Now the morally disgusting ppl are claiming that asbestos doesn’t even give you cancer lol.
Can not even go 50 cents up from $156.69 level? Tomorrow should be very good day.
“Kris you have no life! Hey kris I commented about you! You paying attention to me? Please I’m so lonely. Okay I’m done for the day. I just had to post that and make sure Kris pays more attention to me”Lol beta males here

Johnson & Johnson reached a 52 Week low at 122.65

The sum is just one state!

"Buying a great stock is great but if your looking to see when is the best time to jump in and out then you are a swing trader or day trader , that you have to research your self"
today
The management team at JNJ should be in jail. They knew that talcum powder causes cancer and they covered it up. Shame on them! Take a look at the internal memorandums and you will wonder how these people sleep at night. This is just the beginning.
How long is Reuters going to propagate this old story....waiting for JNJ to take them to court?
Lol cash had followed me to other boards. The guy is a poster boy for increasing mental health funding lol.
slaughter as sheep bought thinking it is safe. Less than 100 soon and decrease dividend
Strong sell.
Share price is essentially flat for past 12 months whereas DOW is up nearly 10% at all time highs - very disappointing performance
"""Dow down because of job shock?"" How about, ""unemployment number is no shock after 3 major hurricanes devastate a good part of the USA. IMO jobs are just fine and barring any further natural disasters we will see good numbers again next month."
Prpo tests for cancer.good news yesturday.only 13.4 million shares trade public
Article about not being able to overturn verdict broke a few minutes ago. Stock dove down $2
Lol goodbye all of yesterday’s gains
Medicine before vaccines. ￼
Reason it's so hard to find a cure for cancer because imo Giants like jnj are the ones causing it. 
who are the contract makers for J&J's vacine?
Should break 140 legal cost and potential billions In losses
JUST LOADED UP ANOTHER 330 SHARES LOVE MY DIVIDENDS AND ONE SHOT VACCINE
JNJ was to be a SAFE HAVEN. Oh well ... I don't know where one goes to invest. Sickening.
The FDA needs to jump on this and pull everything off the shelves.

Just a reminder the day after Father’s Day this company sold cancer causing laden talc to be used by fathers and mothers to be used on their babies and kids.I guess it’s too much to ask for ceos and shareholders to pay for horrible things they caused.
This stock is going nowhere. It will go up to 140 and dive again. Time to get rid of Gorsky and have the BOD split the stock. And then let's hope the new CEO sues Reuter's for the whole company!
More protection drinking a glass of water then taking their shot
"best business model ever. being cancer ti babies, then sell drugs to cure cancer"
recall 1 lot. crazy
Good news on Covid 19 vaccine. The stock still not moving. We are stuck in this $145 to $149 range. I thought today as people start buying quality stocks versus the dash for trash we had lately JNJ could finally go back to $150. Disappointing day despite the good news.
what happened they halted trading they did something
"No vaccine guys, not till 18 month at least. We can’t even cure simple cold! Market will crash and follow by real estate. Cash out and save up"
JNJ's forward P/E is 14.32. A raging buy here! God bless America and our great American companies like JNJ that make great products that improve our lives in the US and around the world.
Holy 0.81%. You guys must be rich lol
I'm it's time for Congress to look at the relationship between Johnson Jannsen and the FDA
$JNJ while I am very happy yu got the contract. $GSPI has 100% FULL SPECTRUM SHIELD. And will be sending out more.than $JNJ FDA and the US juat wont do.it bc they want BIG PHARM $$.
"Question to investors, if you make money on this stock and brag to family. Do you also mention how hilarious it is that their own memos show they sold asbestos laced talc to be used in children and babies?I’m sure your families would be so proud of you."
Not Buying... Expensive Stock...
This company has old management that has no clue how to run a company in this era!!! They should all be let go golden parachute or not!!!
The stock just SHOT UP!!!
"Buying via Drip, ONLY wish I started a decade earlier!"
Play it safe and sell now. Who knows what will happen with so many upcoming law suits?
JNJ slow to the party...when will this dip again???
CYDY is shaping up to run again.
JNJ is down 4.91% to $140.58
"Blah, blah, ""J&J press release in response to Reuters article"", blah, blah....What are they supposed to say? We have killed milions and millions of babies with our asbestos infected talc over the last 50 years?They are paid to lie like crazy now, deny, deny, deny everything."
Bullish
"Uh oh, it's going down again... not looking good for the next week... sell now and come back then."
"Vaccine is at least 12 - 18 months away. The USA will have over 5,000,000 infected people by June 1st. This is the it folks, its over. Even the smartest cannot create an effective treatment or vaccine in time. In fact, in the USA, we cannot even produce enough rubber gloves and hand sanitizer. It was meant to be then!!"
I hope Johnson and Johnson gets sused for 300 billion dollars.
EASY ONE FIFTY?????????????????????
Looks like we have broken out of the 112-114 trading range
That was probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve ever read...
Such a lagging stock
no good numbers?????
I love seeing all the old people in crisis. Taking it out on me because they are not useless to society.
"EVERY VACCINE HAS HAD ALLERGIC REACTIONS AND JNJ ONLY HAD 2 WITH SOME REDNESS... BIG DEAL!HOW ABOUT THE REACTION FROM COVID, LIKE DEATH.... STOP TRYING TO USE 2 REACTIONS OF REDNESS TO TRY TO SHORT JNJJNJ IS ONLY 1 SHOT !!!! KIDS HATE GETTING SHOTS JNJ TO THE MOON ROAR LONGS"
SOOOOOLD151.00
Why wait till September to test take too long some small bio even tru this April
Solid early gains? Month end buying? I wont be surprised to see 140 by june end.
J&J will buy UEEC if not them someone else Better than there surgicel !!!
FAUCI is a Fake.....Always looking for negativity on any vaccine advancement.
Down $20 at the close.
JNJ (65% effective) = JOKE
JNJ soon to take off.........................................
Split time.
Listen... there is NO WAY this does NOT go down.
Why the drop you ask. Now there is a Federal Criminal Probe against opioid manufacturers. SMH.
Still Falling!
sell in May go away 
"When Gorsky testifies you can tell he is hiding behind $2,000 an hour lawyers to try to not commit perjury. He ""believes"" that the talcum powder does not contain asbestos. What a creepy way to phrase his denial. He looks bad."
1 year from now JNJ will be at $140-$150. Need to see pass COVID.
Is the next thing all Johnson & Johnson products pulled off the shelves Walgreens CVS and other stores that sell it? Just so they don't get sued also?
VSTM picking up pace time to load up guys
IRA's and 401k's to CASH before the CASH you were all told 16 days ago. You may have run out of time any move higher should now be sold. The computers are going into SELL mode not all there yet but soon you can see them start to sell any moves higher more and more computers going into SELL mode. One day you will se them all in sell mode and we have seen that playbook before. History always repeats and Flash CRASH told us that you can't beat the computer and the only move is to get out before they All go into SELL mode. GET to CASH before the CRASH.
"JNJ performance is horrible. Mr CEO, please resign, your leadership is outdated. Break up the company so it can be managed correctly. JNJ buys small companies and turns them to dead and slow that just adds more expenses. JNJ rules and regulations are not proactive to help small companies."
Down down big
Another Gorsky Day.
Tell the jnj guys that a vaccine is already being tested on humans. They are late to the party.

Joe I like to hear your comment about the levaquin situation did you think Johnson Johnson knew about that situation the came right from the FDA saying it caused heart problems
I was shocked by the number of law suits pending against JNJ. It isn't only the baby powder but also huge pelvic mesh law suits. I am ready to move on from my long hold position.
"JNJ, could be the cause of Friday and Today's sell off, because there is no news."
best business model ever. bring cancer to ppl then sell cancer drugs. atrocity. sad
Talcum powder 
Did jnj short geron corp before decision ? They put a drug on right to try list before decision then says it was an error? This all needs to be investagated also.
lawsuits incoming
I’m expecting another 5% day on my non cancerous stocks
looks like short sellers are taking it lower...................waiting for fire sale............................... then bbbuuuyyyyy
Looks like the market is drunk in love with FAANG stocks so defensive stocks like JNJ are being ignored... for now.
JNJ is down 4.90% to 135.07
JNJ only making the lawyers rich with TalcGate.

"Just posted after hours today Thursday march 09Johnson & Johnson was hit with six of the seven largest product-defect verdicts of 2016, and 2017 could also wind up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more. The company is facing at least 17 trials in state and federal courts this year in cases blaming five J&J products for injuries and death. They follow trial losses on some of those products, including a $1 billion verdict against the company in December over hip implants and an earlier $72 million verdict over claims its talcum powder causes ovarian cancer.

If you suddenly see Tony Soprano show up on the board, you know which genius is behind it. Wow...what a life this poor guy must have, rofl...seriously, WOW"
Not a dime owed by JNJ. Blame the government and doctors for committing malpractice In over prescribing drugs.
JNJ will probably hit 166.00 monday and JNJ will hit its new target of 185.00 in one week
It's stupid discounts like this that put a smile on my face that I have dividend reinvestment.
Listen to Charles does your wife and kids know you defend this ???
Do you get extra boooobs from that radioactive asbestos powder too? That’s $8 billion a set. J&J will go out of business giving people extra boooobs. Hah! Hah!
Can't these industries make something without side affects?

"As I keep saying, time to get rid of Gorsky! Unlike people who care about their dividend, I care about growth. As of now, the stock is down by $ 2.62!"
"Alex maybe companionate and politically correct but he is running J&J like a charity not a corporation. It's time for a change in leadership! When he announced that J&J would no longer be selling J&J talc products in the US or Canada, our late, great CEO Jim Burke probably rolled over in his grave!! Had Jim Burke done that during the Chicago TYLENOL tampering, there would be NO J&J TODAY. Mass tort lawyers would have flocked to every court in the nation. Gorsky's action with the talc products only insures that these #$%$ of the earth lawyers will now tell the liberal juries ""look what J&J did - they took the products off the market, they are obviously GUILTY!!"" Thanks Alex!!"
time to sellthe junk
lmao - send the stuff that only work 65% of the time to S. Africa
It's funny how all the big mouth bumpers left you don't hear a word from them now.
60 Minutes mentions JNJ as one of the problem companies dumping opiods on the masses. Why don't they just get out of the opiod business? How many people have to OD?
“ lots of things have trace amounts of asbestos therefore it’s okay JandJ sold a product with a dangerous amount”Lol who are you trying to convince? The JandJ defends are intellectual lightweights
why did jnj not share their tax bill implemented money their bring with their employers
Next time someone wants to complain about JNJ's stock price remember days like today.
Started out a bit lethargic from the open but should end up green eod. Don't think the algos were prepared for dovish comments by Powell this morning.
Just hearing about asbestos in their Baby Powder. Asbestos? And they new about it for decades and didn't say word to the public? JNJ should be banned from doing business ever again. I am so mad because i sed tha product for years and they knew i was rubbing Asbestos on my skin and didn't tell me. How can any business be allowed to keep their doors open after this? Everyone knows about the health risks and the Billions of dollars in funds to go to victims or members of families who lost or dies to cancer. JNJ is a horrible brand now and X'd out of my list.
JnJ will higher bid than pfe offer sgyp in feb-23-2019!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But not sure how much Bristol-Myers bid for sgyp?
"Ouch, but looks like an buying opportunity"
Sold this Biden market is a clear sell. I'll buy back under 100...
JandJ shareholders be like “show me the evidence?!?”“it’s right here infront of you... the memos say they knew their product had asbestos”(Proceeds to our fingers in ears and head in sand)*mumbles*”I said show me evidence. I can’t see any!!”
一直播 ID:247772407
Is this really the only defences JandJ shareholders have? Rather than being men and women and take reaponsibility. We have little boys and girls. So far The defences have been-how do you know only jandjs talc have them cancer!-semantic arguments about words used to describe the quantity of asbestos in their talk- and most disturbing. Blaming the cancer victims for just not taking responsibility.- oh I forgot “it’s okay cause we will all die eventually”
PTLA is way oversold $40 buyout $JNJ $Bayer $PFE $NVS
"Any why shouldn't they pay? Is there asbestos in talc? They wouldn't be paying if there wasn't. Are they dishonest & greedy?I worked for Merck for a few years and can tell you that ain't no longer don't by George Merck's saying that ""We put patients before profits"". Funny how they show you that film at your orientation but after being there you realize that greed prevails especially in the Pharma industry. If they have been lying about this and women have been dying as a result then they should pay, they should admit it, and you should sell your stock and move on. I don't want to be involved with a company that is out there killing women and hiring the best lawyer to say they're not doing it."
"JNJ TIME TO ROAR, WE NOT ONLY HAVE PRODUCT, BUT WE HAVE A GREAT DIVIDEND AND EVEN A 1 SHOT VACCINE!"
at least another 30% down
The increasing ridiculous defences I see just show that some shareholders are afraid. They’ve ran from the “how do you know it was only Johnson’s talc”To now “well they’ve done other good things so it’s okay”
Didnt know Appl uses J&J products to make....
Multiple medical sources all day asbestos causes breast cancer. Fail man...

Sinking fast. Sell sell
Jeffrey's analyst says J&J might buy Pfizer's consumer franchise. That would be the second time for J&J to do that?
Yes shark bait the relationship between Johnson and Johnson and the FDA needs to be investigated by Congress imo. Great point you point out

next stop much lower time to drop again
JNJ down in AH. California jury awards $29M in talc case. Appeal expected. When are they going to understand that there is no asbestos in JNJ talc. This is ridiculous and not backed by science.
Okay so the question is does jnj break 100 this fall? If you don’t think so why? 75? Don’t ignore reality folks
"When you lie, cheat, criminally obfuscate the truth about the safety of the product and the lethality of the contaminant that is a known, KNOWN potent carcinogen, you need to pay extreme price and 100 billions is not enough! Let JNJ go bankrupt!"

I bailed out with a small loss when realized that markets going to hell anyways. Better to stay out of trouble. Goodluck
"Yes, this is quite a ""muted response"" to some very good news. But don't let that fool you. the professional traders know that the retail investor is going to try and buy on the news so they hold the stock down and wait for disappointment of the day traders to settle in. Then they get control of large volumes of the stock thru the OPTIONS market. HOLD ON."
IMO if it cures they don't want only thing they want is to mask it to sell more and more of their product
Just found out that JNJ got alerted by http://tradenow.xyz. Seems bullish
What ifiots are going to even listen to a ceo when the main thing is that they're lying in the first place from the article.

JNJ owes a lot of info all of their products now. Nothing will be taken on their word anymore. JNJ screwed themselves for at least the next 10 years.
Cash needs help. Look at his comment history. He’s gone full out stalker lol.
"I love you all support the company blindly while revenues have no growth, the company isn’t innovating, and the share price has been complete garbage. It truly is an abusive relationship but you will do it for your tiny dividend (that comes out of the share price) I love that you are putting your money into this POS while I get rich beyond my wildest dreams in IQ, in nvidia, in Netflix, in Amazon... It makes my day:)"
Breaking news ......Walter white and Donald TrumpAre the same person.
If we can invest our president of United States then we can investigate Johnson & Johnson the FDA and all of them in front of Congress Under oath
Anything out of the ordinary from Shareholders meeting yesterday?

"Value has stated very openly that his disgust at JNJ can be placated at the right price.Value, you are a moral delinquent."
This might imo be the next reuters piece Levaquin that was being manufactured by Johnson & Johnson that was discontinued a few months back was it known to Johnson & Johnson did it cause heart problems?
"Wannabe Whining Walter doesnt like apples, but he really hates the sour grapes of JnJ. Seems it was JnJ's nefarious plan to make him lose all his money by pulling out from the Geron deal, and NOT his own stupidity of ignoring obvious risk. They ruined his fantasy of being an overnight millionairre. Now you need to hear him cry while he hopes for an approval on a second mortgage. It's the plight of the idiots."

JNJ should drop Genscript before putting more money in it. Genscript is a fraud. Most Chinese companies are. There is some truth in the faking data by Genscript.
another red day in the books
Janssen and JnJ have made a point to hire folks that will deal specifically with imetelstat and it was put in their PowerPoint presentation recently. So if you really think they won’t continue with Geron you must be delusional. If they didn’t want to continue they wouldn’t have waited all these years and drag along Geron. If they do decide not to then that will be a shocker to everyone including folks at Geron!
After Hours crash starts in a few minutes ..... HOLD ON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I found a tear in my no more tears shampoo!This is false advertising! I'll see you in court, JNJ!!"
INO got their Covid-19 vaccine into the clinic in Philly and Kansas yesterday. JNJ should just licence that rather than waiting 6 months!
You believe me now.
Vaccine tests halted...SELL !!!
$100 will not hold.
SHORT IT SHORT IT SHORT IT
Come on out JNJ trollie-moley. Remove another comment you don't like. The caddie shack guy has a golf club with your name on it. LOL.

"Here's an idea: J&J buys CLVS who just happens to have an FDA approved PARP breast cancer drug that is close to approval for ovarian cancer indication. Settle those cases by offering treatment. CLVS, $5B, as opposed to a few million times 11,000. You might have to give them a few bucks more but you also own a money maker drug soon to be approved for prostate cancer. You can use that for all the guys that powdered their junk and sue. Buy CLVS. Win-Win!"
scam remains scam
I DON'T WANT A SECOND RATE COVID SHOT FROM JNJ
The accusations by JandJ shareholders are so laughably ridiculous it’s insane.When it comes to the asbestos issues there is only two possibilities.1. The johnson internal memos do exist showing higher ups knew their talc contained asbestos.2. The judge or plaintiff fabricated these memos.The funny thing is johnson isn’t even making the second accusation. Instead they are going down the cigarette company defence route“Ya but how do you know it was our particular carcinogenic product that gave you cancer!!”
Asbestos is very hard to detect so quality control to eliminate it is very costly. Talc powder may be critical for JNJ.
terrible bring back old format!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS GO GUYS TODAY IS FOR JNJ
JNJ going to $150s by EOY.
"Market is up, JNJ is down. Another Gorsky day."

JNJ is down 4.92% to 133.13
Johnson and Johnson is getting sued again. This time the allegation is their baby powder causes ovarian cancer.
Deborah you work for Johnson and Johnson?
"Okay, so I think most of us would agree the organic growth prospects for needle-moving sales/profits are somewhat limited in the short term, and paying stratospheric valuations for development companies with promising products in Phase II or Phase III trials is a speculative use of capital.So...Why not buy GILD? Up to $85/share ($110B in Market Cap).We have the balance sheet flexibility to pull it off (interest rates are still low), combined with GILD's OWN cash/short-term investments, without issuing any new equity.The acquisition would be immediately accretive, to the tune of at least $5/share under the above scenario...more, factoring in any synergies and cost-cutting redundancies, which could make our shares *POP* by more than $100, assuming no multiple contraction.I'm not suggesting in any way this is GOING to happen, only that it could...and it would be GOOD thing for all involved.Ha ha ha. Especially me."
They obviously are going to deny the accusations! They would have law suits left right and center if they agreed to them. I think they found high traces of asbestos in their products and didn’t care and tried to cover it up rather than sending out a mass recall/ have law suits against them. What a disgraceful company.
Canada to make a decision in about a week to implement JNJ vaccine as per Gov statement.

"Just seen a video on retest of J&J Baby Powder. I believe the lab contamination they're talking about is where the initial results came from....FDA. They make it sound as if it were JNJ's labs. JNJ had independent, non-biased labs, do the testing....and the tests showed no asbestos. So, if Yahoo has new information on the original ""contamination""....I'd like to see it."

"The court system in this country has reached ""ludicrous"" speed. Blaming makers of the drug is the same as blaming the water company for providing water to a home where some lunatic decides to drown somebody in the bathtub, using water of course. and since the water company previously new the water was needed by the victim; the victims family can now sue the water company for knowingly providing water to a murderer to use to drown the victim. All water companies must be sued immediately for providing water to murderers out there!!!!!!! Have I made my point. Does anyone else not see the ridiculousness of what that knucklehead judge did in OK to set a precedent. We must remove stupid people from positions of power in this country. I'm open to suggestions!!"

pe waaaaay to high stock only worth about $6 with a safe pe of about 10. good luck.
this app is garbage
In my opinion every store should take all Johnson and Johnson products off the shelves baby powder everything from the Walgreens from CVS is until further notice so they're not liable that gets sued also
Bought another 100 shares at $127.75 ths morning. Couldn't resist another knee jerk reaction to the lunatic in Chief. Plus ex dividend next week. Also betting that the Oklahoma judge makes a common sense ruling on Monday. A win win.
Just another worn out stock thats done almost nothing in 6 months. To think these hack dividend investors are still peddling this. What a joke!
go down for 3 dayswe will see on tuesday
Guess corporations can't be self regulated huh?

Link to the latest scandal?
"Watch ""The Bleeding Edge"" on Netflix"
JNJ should just buy INO and start making vaccines now. Trump know this is where its headed. Buy INO before China does.
"JNJ is at heroic valuations. I am interested in seeing how successful management is at driving growth in JnJ's various segments inc. medical devices, consumer segments and pharmaceuticals. Revenue has been stagnant, but JNJ's valuation is priced for moderate to high growth which I do not see in the companies earnings guidance. With the summer doldrums coming and stocks tending to trade lower, along with the uncertainty w/ Trump's lower tax plans and the Trump administration overall ie. FBI former director James Comey is answering questions form the senate on Thurs re: if Trump tried to interfere with his investigation of conflicts of interest essentially of the Trump administration support for Russian interests verses the US. Comey has far more credibility than Trump, looking forward I suspect his testimony will suggest Trump did try to influence the investigation to protect the Trump admin., thus was obstructing justice with thus grounds for impeachment. Anyone interested in JNJ for a long term hold as this why most people buy it, I would certainly wait for a pullback experienced investors would not by JNJ at these prices I suspect this is largely retail investors bidding the price up.Now is not the time to buy JNJ for certain just wait pullbacks will happen."
Would this type of CHAOS be occurring if Ronal Reagan was POTUS today?
Timber. Going down believing me now?

if JNJ ever paid this it would open the flood gates and bankrupt the company - they have no choice except to keep appealing it - over 1000 potential suits already those alone would kill the company - this goes to the supreme court - the other idiots that paid think they are off the hook--that was only the start - companies have to stop feeding the sharks - it only draws a whole school of them
Today’s question: Will JNJ go bankrupt or will the poor stockholders only lose 50%?
Lol at the cancer product justifications“But fat in burgers is unhealthy!!!”“But other things can cause cancer like cigarettes!”Yes conscious choices by consumers of unhealthy products is the same as a company selling a product they know has severe cancer causing ingredients but the consumers think is safe and they use on babies and kids.

In the one guy that posted false information that Johnson Jonathan said that imetelstat was bad science wonder if the sec contacted him yet us less Johnson and Johnson released false statements why they didn't continue with Geron.
“Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing the company documents that sent J&J shares tumbling.”Reuter’s didn’t lie. They simply published Johnson’s and Johnson’s own internal memos that the judge saw in the court case.Disgusting

Notice last Friday's jump in volume....>2X average volume. Who has financial capability to do this? The rise happened towards end of day.
The long term chart tells me that a gap to $95 will be filled. That would also tend to normalize the dividend yield from a historical perspective.
Ouch today’s going to be rough for JandJ. More lawsuits to come
two words- baby powder
Priced for a $4 move. I hope is moves less than that.
Maybe instead of going on with his buddy Cramer he should be asked under oath through congress?

"If JNJ doesn't have enough cash to pay my 8B breastlement, I'd be willing to accept a ton of fentanyl instead. No generics please."
I guess until a few of these lawsuits get decided upon JNJ is going to be ignored by the markets and trend down to neutral. It also doesn't help that Pharma is a hot topic in this election cycle. An easy target for both sides. If we weren't up over 250 pts on the DOW today we would've seen another $1 + loss in PPS. GLTA longs.

Did my white heart attack post get deleted?Hey white: what's your blood pressure at? Chill!
"JNJ is s company that I always thought I should buy into. BUT it just seems that they are ALWAYS having some legal problems . And the settlements are always BIG. Plus , some years ago I heard tales of rampant drug use at one of their production facilities in NJ ( Ethicon??) How well could that have ever worked out ?? So, NO JNJ for me !!!"
"Until this BOD splits the shares, we are in a trading range. The stock is too pricey from a psychological POV."
“Why Kris do you only care about only jnj cancer patients and not all cancer patients ???”Who said I only care about JandJ cancer patients. Join your wife man. You are a waste of space
No guilt or shame? All you care about is share price and you wonder why this country is in it's current shape?
Looks like Gorsky showed up for work today.

Correction...the breakdown has started. It'll be $110 before anything else
The most reputable company in the world...this talc #$%$ is nonsense
"Beautiful pre-market movement, AKA no movement. I've got some options that need to expire worthless."
Trump emergency good for stocks ? Looks like it.
If JNJ appeals the next jury will pound them into the ground and break it off short.
Headline chasers are running the market. Propping up EV stocks with no revenue no earnings. Value continues to lag for years. Sad. Not sure when it changes but so much money out there now investing . Dumb money. But they seem to be winning.
JNJ IS APPROVED JUMP ON BOARD THIS SHIP IS GOING ONE WAY AND THATS UP
This market is crazy and sucks
"In one year, Elvis Presleys doctor prescribed over 10,000 pills to Elvis. Big deal ?Well yeah. Doctors like this work their way into the AMA, The FDA, and into drug companies including lobbyists and board of directors. Do you understand why we have a drug crisis in our country ?"
"I saw nothing but, I'll take a hit of what ever your smoking"
don't worry - jnj shot over work 66% of the time and it looks like they are going to sell it to S Africa - buy buy buy - thank god i don't have to take this one
why is it so weak lately? Any negative news we missed for big pharma and health care?
still kind of a high PE for what's going on
Panic selling. Problem is an old one and on going. Multiple generations of management have condoned this....dont think so. Are you old enough to remember the tylenol scare??? Blood in the water = opportunity!.
"Closing green today, hahaha"
It's time to get rid of Gorsky. He should be suing Reuters for their fake publication. Notice the difference between a typical corporate liberal like Gorsky and a fighter like Trump.
Yahoo Reader...Your wife was pretty inexperienced. I had to teach her everything last night. Man is she ugly a real woff woff mi key brain.
The Trump Administration needs to look into the relationships with the FDA and Johnson & Johnson in my opinion this will open up a huge?
JNJ beat!!!!!
I’m up 5%. You guys want my crumbs?
"Hmm. On the 5 year graph do I see a head and half shoulder arcing into a future pan waiting for a handle, or just another chart-fart."
Omg he’s telling me he’s leaving like anyone cares. The guy is obsessed with me...
OVERVALUED by $100.....
this shows the dishonesty of JNJ management. i bet there are side effects also on this garbage vaccine.
sick greed
The company simply has to get out in front of this. Back in the day a Tylenol scare occured due to tapering. A news article came out and crushed JNJ short term. As always you need to not act irrational and emotional. This too shall pass.

"June 2017, JNJ = 129 p/s. Today, two years later, same price. DEAD MONEY."
Still have to laugh at all the hoax spreading folks...now jumping the line and raising their hand for the vaccine. Hopefully they didn’t influence someone who didn’t know better as they clearly did
I was always an Android guy that begin with I thought their phones were way better than them.
Market manipulation before the upgrades come in. Sometimes boring is better.
Comment on that.
Go on JNJ - been waiting for a breakout. ZERO death rate rules !!
"$JnJ really needs to show their shareholders some level of confidence. They need to take command of this situation and make a strong offer for $GERN now. Having this platform cancer killer will created unheard of shareholder value immediately and over time. As for GERN, well one amazing payday. The biggest winners? Those who's cancer will be killed."
SOOOOOLDstay short now..................................
How come their PE ratio is so high?
$110 stock price coming soon for JNJ
dang... 8 billion.. whoa. 4 bil a teet.. good money
Cash’s wife would of been proud. A man defending a company that’s own memos showed t knowingly sold a cancerous product. While she got cancer according to him. Wow. The nazis could of taken lessons.
"JNJ made cancer-causing product to be put on people AT BIRTH making $, then offer healthcare solutions to help people manage Cancer and make double $$, brilliant!! Sarcasm."
Is JNJ overvalued at current levels? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awe-someSTOCKS.
Timber. Woogy you get it yet? Deborah that dividend may not even be safe.
This should be 200!!
"No worries once the information is clarified ny JNJ, it will come back to 170 by afterhours"
I believe everyone's been looking with causes cancer why couldn't be right under our noses baby powder ? I'm sure every person on this earth at sometime was exposed to it wouldn't you say?
"2 doses 2 months apart, wow, this vaccine doesn’t look exactly as the safest IMO"
Will we have another Gorsky day or will the stock go up? Maybe he took off a few extra days for the holiday? We can only hope.
you are going to see J&J split and go up in price went congress pass the new health plans next year TRUMP and WOODY JOHNSON are great friends was white house this week I say J&J will be the major supplier drugs for the new health plan next year I say the stock to 150 and next year SPLIT
"StockProphet777- Even JNJ is running out of steam, as the general stock market is getting ready to turn negative. The volatility etf UVXY, currently at RECORD LOWS, is turning positive as the general stock market sells off."
Are we having fun yet? Huh? Just sell. Take a deep breath and get it over with.
Where’s the VACCINE
Exit all stocks.
This will go below 160. My sell got hit at 165. I forgot I had it.
Does anyone know how many more appeals JNJ has for this latest award of $2.1?
We hit $129.61 and just bounced. Nice!
JNJ has become a “has been” Healthcare stock. Don’t tell about their great pipeline of new drugs and products...just look at their earnings and stock price. It is time to move on.
"More resultsDextera Surgical Inc(NASDAQ:DXTR) All in this, they got buy out"

You guys should sue jew run Reuters for damages

"What happened is Apple charges over $1,000 for a phone before phone companies used to give you the phone for free with a 2-year contract but that doesn't happen anymore so when people have to dish out $1,000 for a phone they are going to hang on to their phone as long as possible and you're going to see sales drop and drop every single year"
Looks like Vir might be the play here. They are doing it right
"Still remember how JNJ went 120 two years ago when the lawsuit started. Now case almost settled, no reaction?"
Any mesothelioma victims?
JNJ IS A VIRTUAL MONOPOLY AND THAT IS MY BET TO GO UP
No lying. That's what I thought.
Cancer causing drug pushers.
Gorsky has to go!!!! Where are the mutual funds on this?
TTNP just got started!
The best thing here is despite my challenges. No one has dared to say they would be fine telling their families about the memos and the fact Johnson knowingly sold cancer causing products to be used on kids and babies.Even with the anonymity and disconnect of posting on the internet. Even you Moral and conscience free couldn’t say you’d have no problem telling them.Just shows you how deep down you are guilty and ashamed

Don’t except this share to be red forever. But a nice slow steady downturn would be great
Boycot India.
JNJ must drop since it has many weaknesses.
I love this. The JandJ shareholder keep proving how bad I’m getting to them. They keep reacting and crying nonstop. This is perfet
thats why ur price now is downa nd #$%$ bad results... nvax has the second most contract globally.... best results so far...
Under pressure
"TTNP, buy it to fight the opioid crisis in this country."
"JNJ is -without question- a great company but unfortunately at current valuation a very fully valued stock. With JNJ at 128.55/sh and a 130/sh PT, there is very little upside potential from current levels. A more attractive investment in my opinion is AGIO. AGIO and CELG are partners. AGIO has close to $800 mil in cash and a pipeline with blockbuster potential. Canaccord currently has a $90/sh PT on AGIO and mgt owns 25% of the stock. In a buyout or as a standalone company I believe AGIO is worth more than $85/sh over the next 6-12 months while JNJ and PFE represent dead money. The market is speaking to us. Listen..."
Baby Powder Sale !
"JNJ's ""vaccine"" is a patchouli scented band aid you put over a dead guy's eyes and mouth after he's died of Covid-19 and just before he's lowered into the ground. Guaranteed to be 100% effective at keeping zombies away for at least 6 months."
Someone please explain what is going on. This rollercoaster ride is ridiculous!!

Has anyone heard the status of the JNJ Puerto Rico plants? If the whole area is without power they aren't going to be producing some of their big runners like Remicade. There isn't much supply in the pipeline. Worried there might be an earnings miss or a the potential for a short attack.
They are hitting us hard today!
"Yahoo doesn't update the EX- Dividend date....do they wait for an announcement from the company? Anyone know....it should be sometime this week, no?"
"J&J should partner with Moderna for the coronavirus vaccine,Thoughts?"
JNJ is at the moment vastly overvalued should fall back to $120 level in the coming weeks.
hmmm...why would anyone expect it to rally anytime soon..if ever. Are you and friends rushing out to buy there products??
"Todays action is simply a short term rotation and money shifting into CAT, MMM and MCD. New week and new earnings reports."
I’ve literally went 90% in. Dividend in two weeks on a stock very undervalued . Who would sell this ? The nonsense talcum powder lost its steam already . You’re an idiot if you sell anything under 140
Added today on the recent pullback and today is last day to get dividend.
Why not buy AMRN at $20 per share all stock transaction?

"Last year it was talc and opioids to put brakes on this company. This year it's coronavirus....is this a necessary evil to knock the value of stock down only to buy up shares and watch it grow to new highs? If so, who is in the know here?

Don’t see this going back down to $150 at all. Maybe $155/$156

The one thing is these cases can drag on for a really long time...all the while jnj keeps printing money. Z
JNJ is a healthcare giant trading at an oversold status with an RSI of 33 and a P/E of less than 20.This company is pharmaceutical icon in America. It seems that Wall street is FIXED ! The current drop comes in the face of much good news and earnings that were great that beat expectations.

If you like blood money this stock is for you. The shareholders here are some of the most disingenuous disgusting individuals I’ve ever seen.

"WOOHOO 2/26/21 @ 2:44 PMA Food and Drug Administration advisory committee is expected to endorse Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine later Friday, with panel members framing the shot as a crucial third option to vaccinate millions of Americans.The vaccine appears broadly effective against the virus and is especially good at preventing severe cases, according to data presented by FDA staff and Johnson & Johnson at the meeting. And because the vaccine is given as a single dose and is easy to ship, it presents an appealing profile for public health officials struggling to vaccinate hard-to-reach or skeptical populations — groups of people increasingly in the sights of state leaders launching outreach efforts."
"Of course they announce a repurchase plan, right after their major screw up to cover their backsides.."
Should retest 120 soon
How about we get rid of Gorsky. That would be a nice Christmas present!
HAHAHA $499K and its over! CHUMP CHANGE

Is it time to make a move on JNJ? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesom-eSTOCKS.
JNJ doesn't plan to start testing their vaccine on humans until September. I got my money on another company developing a a vaccine way before they do. Not to mention the potential of a mutation in the virus.

Johnson just had to pay out 10 million in talc case. I guess the judge fabricated those memos right?
everything is down.
good move
Wondering why JNJ getting killed lately. Any news or just manipulation?
"The reality is JNJ has limited growth, but a steady dividend. I do not think pharmaceutical drug sales will increase significantly as people are increasingly focusing on prevention and living healthy lifestyles thus they healthier, as well drugs only act as band aids verses providing solutions to an illness, as most people seek complete recovery this means less demand for drugs, but more for good vitamins not the synthetic kind but food grade, personal trainers, yoga facilities, exercise cloths ect...But I think medical devices and consumer products will continue to have steady sales, thus with this very, very, very overvalued US market JNJ is relatively a buy albeit JNJ's price to book, price to sales are both high but with people buying NFLX with a PE of 198, flat revenue but increasing subscribers suggesting to low a subscriber price or something odd is happening and stratospheric debt, the market is out of sync, and I think well overdue for a correction."

Iodine 131 is an attractive agent to use because its physical properties of longer range and higher energy could potentially improve efficacy for bulky lesions and lesions that have lower PSMA expression. Iodine has been used widely in other cancer therapeutics, is broadly available with a ready supply and known safety profile. We look forward to evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1095 in this Phase 2 study.”"

"As expected, the resident angry moron who lost his life savings in GERN, posted more false information, saying that there were no rate hikes in the ""obama era"". Aside from rate cuts being needed to stop the 45% free fall in the market, which was a culmination of the bursting of the housing bubble, caused by toxic mortgages, allowed by lack of regulation under the Bush administration, the statement itself us simply false. There were 2 rate hikes, 1 in 2015 and 1 in 2016. Remember, just because you may THINK something is true because it FEELS right. THOUGHTS and FEELINGS are not FACTS...especially when you are either to dopey to understand this concept and to lazy to actually look up this fact.This describes the type of person, who vents their frustrations at stupidly over investing in a mega risk micro cap biotech, and looking for a scapegoat for their own stupidity."

"JNJ partnered With GERN because TGET Will bring IMET to market to address many different forms of cancer. Search3 Stocks Billionaires Can't Buy, but You CanExtreme wealth has its downsides. Warren Buffett is too rich to own these stocks, but they are fine investments for smaller investors.Anders Bylund, Sean Williams, And Matthew DiLallo(TMFZahrim)Jul 11, 2017 at 8:47AMEnormous wealth has its downsides. Small investors like you and I can build game-changing wealth in stocks no billionaire would ever touch. We asked three Foolish investors to share some of the best names that Warren Buffett and George Soros wouldn't or simply couldn't trade. Read on to see how CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust(NYSE:CORR), Magic Software Enterprises(NASDAQ:MGIC), and Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) fit that bill.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The little software-building company that couldAnders Bylund (Magic Software Enterprises): You won't find a whole lot of interest in Magic Software Enterprises from deep-pocketed investors or the largest mutual fund managers. The company is simply too small and too thinly traded to move the needle for an investor with huge assets.To wit, the provider of software development and marketing solutions sports an average trading volume of less than 48,000 shares per day. Trading at roughly $8 per share, that works out to a daily dollar volume of roughly $385,000. That's small enough that individual investors can wield enough capital assets to account for more than 10% of the daily volume in a single trade. It's also small enough that a million-dollar buy or sale would soak up several days' worth of current orders, with market-moving results.Add in Magic Software's relatively small market cap of $360 million, and you'll have a complete set of big-money handcuffs. This is a thinly traded small cap, best left to smaller mutual funds or individual investors for the time being.Only 5% of Magic Software's shares are held by insiders and very large shareholders today. The largest mutual fund holding is a 0.7% stake held by the Westcore International Small Cap Fund, for a grand total of $2.1 million. The largest owner overall is a hedge fund called Denver Investment Advisors, whose entire asset base adds up to just $2.2 billion.Of course, none of this matters unless Magic Software qualifies as a stock worth investing in. In my view, it's at least worth a closer look by growth investors. The Israel-based company's shares are trading at a very reasonable 13 times forward earnings. Those earnings are expected to increase by 17% next year and an average of 14% over the next five years. Don't back up the truck to invest your life savings here, but Magic Software could be a quiet little winner over the next few years.This small-cap clinical-stage drug developer appears ripe for the picking Sean Williams (Geron): Clinical-stage biotech company Geron could be an intriguing stock for investors to consider, and it's certainly one that'll stay off the radars of billionaires.To begin with, it's a small-cap company with a $457 million market cap. Most billionaires prefer to buy larger companies and often view small caps as risky, volatile, and unproven. Second, Geron's share price is less than $3, which is a level often associated with risk and volatility. And finally, Geron is a wholly clinical-stage drug company, which means there's potential for wild share-price swings, and the need for investors to stay on top of clinical data. Most billionaires, including Buffett, simply don't have that kind of time to devote to keeping up with clinical trials.However, billionaires' loss can be your gain. Geron has but one compound in clinical development, imetelstat, as a treatment for myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndrome. But this one compound demonstrated jaw-dropping results in early stage clinical trials for myelofibrosis a few years back.Previous therapies targeted at MF have focused on the symptoms caused by the orphan disease, such as enlarged spleen and anemia, and done absolutely nothing to slow or halt disease progression. Imetelstat, however, demonstrated both partial and complete responses in MF patients, suggesting that it could become the standard of care in treating MF. The lone Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy on the market specifically for MF is Incyte's Jakafi, and it's on track to generate around $1.05 billion in sales this year at the midpoint. That $1.05 billion could almost entirely be imtelstat's if it excels in ongoing studies.Geron also isn't navigating the development of imetelstat alone. It's partnered with Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Geron and J&J worked out a deal worth as much as $935 million in 2014, which netted Geron $35 million upfront and gave it the opportunity to earn $900 million in various development and regulatory milestones. It's also entitled to a handsome royalty on net sales of imetelstat, if approved. Considering how versed J&J is in bringing new drugs to market, Geron may be able to sit on its laurels if imetelstat is approved, push its costs down substantially, and bank significant profits based on royalty revenue. It is also possible that J&J could just choose to acquire Geron if imetelstat is a success.Billionaires won't be going anywhere near Geron, but it could be ripe for the picking for biotech-savvy, patient investors.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.An income growth stock you won't want to missMatt DiLallo (CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust): Billionaire investors tend to avoid smaller stocks because they'd need to buy an outsized stake in the company for it to make a meaningful difference in their portfolio, which alone could move the stock. Because of that, most uber-wealthy investors would likely avoid buying CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, as its current market cap is less than $400 million.However, just because most billionaires wouldn't bother with CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust doesn't mean you should avoid this high-yielding energy-focused REIT. That's because the company offers investors an eye-popping yield of nearly 9%, with plenty of upside potential as it buys additional assets.Supporting that payout is a growing portfolio of mission-critical infrastructure properties that it leases to customers under long-term agreements, which provide the company with stable cash flow. While the company endured a period of uncertainty during the oil market downturn after two large customers went through bankruptcy proceedings, CorEnergy's leases survived untouched.Adding further stability to its payout is the company's conservative payout ratio, which has averaged around 75% of its adjusted funds from operations over the past year. Finally, CorEnergy has an excellent balance sheet, evidence by a low debt-to-capitalization ratio of 24%, which is below its 25% to 50% target.Because of its healthy dividend coverage and ample financial flexibility, CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust has the capacity to make a couple of acquisitions per year going forward, targeting deals in the $50 million to $250 million range. Given its small size, these deals could be needle-moving, potentially providing the company with the ability to grow its already generous payout at a brisk pace. That combination of income with upside makes CorEnergy a compelling stock to consider, even if it's too small for most billionaires.Anders Bylund has no position in any stocks mentioned. Matt DiLallo owns shares of CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust and Johnson & Johnson. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Johnson & Johnson."
"With a already huge Market Cap and huge float and a lot of the approval baked in, it will be hard to move this pig much."

Just think about this. JandJ ceos according to their own memos knew about the asbestos..Knowing their product would be used especially on baby’s.. just to make afew extra bucks they turned a blind eye while their product sold to be used on children and baby’s.
