"OK price, dividend is too small"
$CTSH Target Raised by UBS Sell USD 50 » USD 55
Why this up like $1.50 after hours today? Tried to grab a 63.50 weekly call for 5 bucks didnt get filled so I loaded up on December 65 strikes may end up in the money tomorrow.
Into the 50's....wall street hates lower guidance.....stay away.
POOR RESULT!!!

IS CTSH in Financial Crisis? Why they delay the payment to Vendors citing COVID? Cognizent sent emails to their vendor and delay the payment to 90 days instead of net 30 days. This is actually exploiting the situation. Vice President of Procurement sent new Payment terms to its vendors indicating that they have cashflow issues. Trouble is brewing. or exploitation is happening. Publicly traded company can be better than this.
Way way oversold RSI!!! Time for $$$
"Not bashing, just stating the facts. They missed Wall St. earnings expectations & on top of that cut 2019 outlook. Basically, if you are not holding bags then hardly any reason out there now to invest in this sinking boat imo. At this point, all trading is gambling as no one knows how deep the bottom is. My small entry point is set at 50."
"I've been holding this stock for 8 years now, been stagnant for couple of years. Seems this could continue for awhile. No point in holding this and missing the action."
Looks OVER REACTING
GOOD TIME TO BUY!!!!!!!!!!

Monitoring this one very closely.

A winning trade if you got in this morning.

All these technology services companies will disintegrate slowly in next 10 to 15 years. There is not much business from the clients to these service oriented companies. Already most companies automated a lot and companies are not willing to spend.
CTSH is down 5.58% to $65.36
Why so weak?
Shouldn't this stock tank after Trump's executive order going after the H1B visa and the outsourcers? This company heavily depends on H1B visas for profitability. Plus they hired an ex HP guy as CEO to lead acquisitions but this is one of the guys who brought down HP how is he going to fix Cognizant?
"Earning tomorrow, definitely hits $90"
I been holding this stock for 15 years and it's been very good to me. But the last 4-5 years it been mostly trading in 59-64 range. I am going to start divesting if upcoming ER disappoints. The good old days appear to be over!!!
cognizant isnt likely to be bought but the company is a real vood one and its cheap
this company employees purchase stocks on regular basis... this share boosts up with out market circumstances....and no short attacks... great long term investment 
"Reposted from Seeking Alpha I think the author @sa Editor Brandy Betz is expecting a lot of things in Q2 to have gone right for Cognizant with Covid, India shutting down and the Maze attack. Having some experience in the security realm and software in general, I can tell you these situations rarely go well and can be, in fact, disastrous.I have compiled some questions for the Q2 conference call for the analysts, followed by what I think the more reasonable answers from management likely are. 1) When did the Maze ransomware attack stop affecting customers? Answer - The impact from the attack is ongoing even into July. There has still been no attestation of our platform and so the effects are widespread including significant loss of revenue from major customers who no longer use the platform. 2) Why did the company provide no updates to investors during the quarter regarding ongoing impacts to customers? Answer - We did not understand the full impact of the issue and may have unintentionally mislead investors and analysts in the Q1 call by saying that it would be over by May's month end. 3) How many employees are still not able to work, have been furloughed or have been terminated because of the attack and the aftermath? Answer - Many thousands, and the number is increasing every day because if Cognizant isn't paying them they quit and go elsewhere. 4) What was the impact of the Maze attack coupled with the 4 hour notice shutdown in India? Answer - Thousands of employees were stranded without work-from-home equipment for weeks, making them unbillable for long periods of time during the quarter. 5) How many employees were/are being paid but were/are still not billable because the Maze attack made customers no longer trust the platform, making it doubly costly? Answer - Thousands more. 6) What have customers said about your liability for contracts which have been unable to be filled? Answer - Most of our major customers are likely looking at substantial legal and financial remedies. We don't know how great of a loss this will cause Cognizant in future quarters. 7) When do you think the platform can be trusted by major customers again with a full attestation? Answer - We really don't know, but we have tried to be transparent, if not with investors, at least with our customers. 8) How many of the major customers had to find alternative solutions, contractors, their own employees working overtime and competitors (like Accenture) to fulfill Cognizant contracts because of the attack and therefore risk the brand going forward? Answer - Many of the major accounts had significant work that was unable to be fulfilled in Q2 and will likely not be undertaken in Q3. The risks of cyber attacks from a reputational perspective are significant and we will need to spend considerable resources in Q3 both in people and money to remedy the situation. 9) Were the data and processes partitioned that were compromised? Don't the contracts you sign with customers require that separation? If it was partitioned, why did this affect so many customers? Who has taken responsibility for the security failure, and who is the cybersecurity expert in-house? Answer - We are looking at the architecture and no one, of course, blames themselves.My opinions are my own and different ones are what makes a market. The situation above just takes into account an average cybersecurity disaster, relatively competently managed, not even close to a worst case. My best case scenario estimate for Q2 earnings is .30, down 68% yoy. Price target $40 in the very short term. I expect numerous downgrades post earnings as analysts take down their numbers amid lost faith in management for their lack of candor. IMO looking ahead, Covid, India, slow platform attestation and the loss of significant numbers of billable employees make even a quick turnaround in Q3 unlikely and those and future quarterly numbers will have to come down appreciably."

"Digital Transformation Services Market Astonishing Growth | Accenture, Capgemini, CognizantRead Detailed Index of full Research Study at @ https://www.htfmarketreport.com/reports/2486847-global-digital-transformation-services-market-4"
"Wow, this board is pretty lively. Shows how much retail investors are interested in this one."
"This came off the CSCO board:While I usually feel political posts should go elsewhere, I will make an exception. Working with the U.S. intelligence community on several projects I could not resist giving my thoughts about what has been going on in this country for quite a while. Disclaimer: I voted for neither Presidential candidate of the major parties during the 2016 election. ""Who rules America""?After forty years of observation, readings, and conversations, it's the elites via their organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.They are the primary drivers behind the efforts to impeach Trump. They are using their assets in the Press, the intelligence community, the media, etc. for the impeachment of Trump.They had heavily invested in getting the Clintons into power. The Trump election and the Brexit were major blows to their plans for a one world government run by their shills like the Clintons, JImmy Carter, George Bush I, etc.They cannot control Trump like the others and they are afraid he will expose them. During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an ad in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans."
Just hang in there
"Hedge funds are buying anything IT and services with a California location anywhere near silicon valley. Be careful when stocks like guidewire and everbridge go up and stocks like Pager Duty, Zoom, and Slack go down. Slack was even a direct ipo, so it will be harder to manipulate and for hedge funds to force its movements. I am still in the two best luxury sites till after Christmas REAL and RVLV and was lucky and blessed to add cannabis biotech SRNE before the bell. A baby GWPH with huge potential, could go to 30."

"Updates from SEC’s web, the whole year performance of CTSH was announced today. Other than profits collected (cash flows), the reported earnings also include “accruals”, which is benefits estimated to be received in the future. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/CTSH. Nevertheless, the estimation is not perfect. For example, managers may abuse accruals to adjust earnings, resulting in low future profits. Based on this, whereas two firms report the same earnings, the one with higher accruals would perform worse next period. To know the quality of $CTSH ’s reported earnings, You can use the method at http://www.financial-education-hub.com/2/CTSH to calculate the firm’s accruals level, and the portion that may not be able to be collected in cash."

"with the current administration restricting Visa, CTSH and other outsourcers will have to shy away from pure labor arbitration play model.
