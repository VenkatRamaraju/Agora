Recent headlines and conversations for QCOM
We can copy NXPI strategy. Vote blue now to get the buy out approved the hold out the stocks to request $90 to tender :). Win / wint strategy. Any comment?
"Settlement with Apple is huge. This will take wind out of sails of other pending disputes/ litigation. This is huge that qcom and Apple are Partners again. QCOM potential is huge. Going to 150 within a year or 2, in my opinion."
"Ballot is in the mail today, DO NOT IGNORE IT, VOTE AGAINST BROADCOM BUYING IT FOR $70. THAT IS JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE WHERE IT IS TODAY. DO NOT IGNORE IT, WHATEVER BROADCOM SAYS VOTE FOR, VOTE AGAINST. IT IS YOUR MONEY. THIS IS LIKE GIVING AWAY THE COMPANY."
I will just discard that blue proxy!
"Actual QCOM trial opening statement documents exposing APPL's plot. Worth a glance if you've got the time, it is well summarized.https://www.scribd.com/document/407463620/Qualcomm-opening-statement?campaign=VigLink&ad_group=xxc1xx&source=hp_affiliate&medium=affiliate"
"Numbers to watch: If QCOM breaks above $68 and/or NXPI drops below $121, the writing is on the wall."
"FTC answered y‘day Q‘s opening brief to the 9th (can’t link it, it’s 130+ pages, it’s on Scribd). In a nutshell: FTC dropped Judge Koh‘s Argumentation around the Aspen Ski Ressort, saying that the high standards of the Aspen Ski Ressort court findings are not applicable. Focus of FTC is now the partial summary of Judge Koh: Q is committed to license on component level due to ATIS and TTA rules (whilst Q is a member of ATIS and TTA). FTC does not refer to Texas Court Ruling, which denies the duty to license on component level. Argument of FTC: Q has contractual obligation to license on component = chip level (not on device level) due to the obligation based on ATIS and TTA rules. Apart from the diametral findings of the Texas Court, it’s worth to understand, that both ATIS and TTA don’t make it clear, which SEP have to license on what level: SEPs which are fully carried out within a modem chipset OR SEPs which are partially carried out within a modem chipset OR all SEPs regardless of where implemented. As there are no standards for chipset modems, how would be deciding process what sections of what standards are practiced by Modem chipsets ? ETSI does not require component licensing: so companies, who are only ETSI member could license on device level, ATIS and TTA members on component level. Looks like ridiculous...FTC case is dead, for my opinion. The 9th, who criticized the Aspen Ski Ressort finding from Judge Koh already will do the same with component licensing. It’s only a pity, that if will take until spring..."
What a gift. Clear leader in 5G tech and chips and the sheer volume of patents alone will push this company into the 2020s as a powerhouse. Loading up at $150.
It will break 150 this week!
"Apple claiming they want to make EVs, modem chips. What is next? Appl is just pumping their stock"
"Despite the ruling, Qualcomm is unlikely to ever pay that amount to Apple because the iPhone maker has already withheld about $1 billion in payments to Qualcomm, and Qualcomm's financial statements have already accounted for that loss. The judge's ruling will not become final until after an upcoming trial is completed, Reuters said."
Shouldn't this stock be trading up instead of down?
"Very rough and quick math, perhaps someone more involved can comment. Next year estimates of $3.50 cents, or roughly $5.2bn of net income. If I take out 1/3 of the shares ($30bn is rougly 1/3 of market cap), leaves roughly 1bn shares outstanding. That would imply EPS of $5.20. Now, you won't be buying all shares at today's market price, so let's say $5.00 of EPS. I don't know what the right P/E for this, trades 17x 2019 today, but historically traded closer to 14x. Even if I use 14x-15x multiple, I get to a 70-75 dollar stock without NXPI. Am I missing something?"
The bottom line is we are going higher. It is an easy $100 stock that could go even higher if they announce another stock buy back program and a dividend increase. I could have bought more but I am doing very well so far so I am not complaining.
"When a trillion-dollar company threatens you and uses every dirty trick in the book against you but you don't bow down to them and still come out as a winner, you are an exemplary company! QCOM is the best!!!"
the chart looks real nice for a fast rise to $65
"I would buy more, but I think I have enough shares at this point lol What is your thoughts on the whole higher tax rates for ""Corps""?"
https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/apple-5g-modem/
Anyone has any idea as to what to do with Qcom shares if you are already holder of
"I honestly thought we would be around 160 - 170 by January 4th, 2021. Now I think we will reach these levels right after the next earnings call. If what analysts are saying about Apple's iPhone 12 having a 40% jump in sales in China I just don't see how QCOM can't be at these levels."
I think the market now realized these antitrust allegations way overdone and political motivated by a party activists (judge and the 2 FTC commissioners) wants to show their party loyalty for future positions. The case will be settled or reversed by the administration particularly now after Apple settlement and INTC exited the modem business. I do not think there was ever been antitrust or monopoly case by any government/country outside their country border just to side with foreign companies outside the US?????? Crazy politics.Just wondering what is the role of the FTC head commissioner (R) and why’s he is MIA ????? How come 2 commissioners (D) prevail against 2 (R) ???
Who's selling on 5 year bullish trend guaranteed company?
"With splits, my 3500 shares date back to 1998! It's been frustrating and infuriating at times, but they have always led in IP, patents and licensing strategy. Have bought and sold shares along the way and would have 7400 if I'd never sold any. Never stopped believing, but still waiting for that price target of $250 called before just before the dot-com implosion. "
"One week ago, many people here motivated me to keep faith. Now, 260 million shares later, feels like heaven. Happy Eastern, future looks bright !!!"
"For those longs on this board, don't be concerned with tomorrow's ER and keep your eyes on the big picture. The big picture is the 5G revolution in communications. This is not a typical cell phone wireless connectivity rollout. 5G technology is very disruptive and will change wireless, communication and technology as we know it. Just the low latency part of 5G (from 50 milliseconds to less than 2 milliseconds) is ""required"" by autonomous driving for real time response (see Mars drone flight!). For phones - yes.. with MM Wave it will now take seconds to download a movie instead of minutes. Cell towers can now handle 10X more subscribers, etc. However, what the analysts are not understanding is the cell phone part of this is not the big deal! The problem is that 5G technology covers many other industries and the guys covering QCOM are phone guys! The 5G technology will grow at over 100% every year for 5 years. This technology will be in healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, government, military, etc. Then you have consumer IOT, home networks, on and on. NOT JUST PHONES. QCOM owns the patents, they invented it! Now they have court protection for that invention, they are effectively sitting on a gold mine. Years of growing revenue. The last few quarters and the surface has not even been scratched - yes mobile phones are rolling out. Big deal... there is huge technology rollouts yet to come. It will take years for anything close to a peak in JUST 5G! So, I am only mentioning the above to help you understand what you own. At today's price it is a steal - this company will begin growing fast as this ramps. They will become the next FAANG type stock. If you own shares - feel confident you have made a very good decision."
Congratulations bulls! Bullish crossover attained. AI robots and funds usually pitch in here!
"GS ""downgraded"" QCOM from neutral to SELL on 4/17. UP 9 % since then........nice call GS. I repeat, never listen to analyst upgrades or downgrades. They are just trying to get the small investor to lose money to them."
hedgeFunders used qcom as a scapegoat (besides beating EPS under shipment constraints)..to find fault and sound like a miss and use all this short money to cover their GME etc losses...hopeless ...everybody should do their own research before listening to citi...the same guys will buy shortly...
Shorts gonna have trouble shorting this right it’s just gonna spike when they cover again... too much volume
"Trump: Tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase to 25%""President Donald Trump, despite repeated claims by the White House that trade talks with Beijing were progressing, announced Sunday on Twitter that tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase next week to 25% from 10%.“The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” Trump wrote in the surprise announcement.""He also threatened that the U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, just days after Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that Trump was hopeful he could hammer out a deal with China.""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-tariffs-on-200-billion-of-chinese-goods-will-increase-to-25-2019-05-05?link=MW_latest_news"
buy on the dip!
"5 G is kicking in, finally, Huge buybacks in process, and if Apple and Qcom make peace, we are looking at a 100 buck stock in less than a year ."
What's up with the FTC legal battle? This could mean big moves up or down for QCOM depending which way the court dictates.
"I got thumbs down for saying this would close the $136.57 gap, why? I said it’s a big time buy based on when this technical threshold was seen. I don’t get people here"
Where is the ceo. Start a buyback program.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 beats by $0.07; GAAP EPS of $0.42 misses by $0.06.Revenue of $4.81B (-17.5% Y/Y) beats by $100M.
Oh. Interesting.
Bad day try 3years 9 months go Joe great job
"Wow, NXPI is trading north of $118. I guess that $110 QCOM buyout aint gonna happen."
My 2021 calls went up like a rocket. Congratulations everyone who had the insight to build a position before today.
"Fly Qcom, fly! New price traget for end of April $75! https://stocktwits.com/symbol/QCOM"
"I'm so tired of trying to battle the censors, so I'll go this route there is a good bit of news alerts popping up from yesterday through this morning about QCOM and Jio and their plans to rebuild India's cell infrastructure using QCOM's RAN technology. HAPPY HUNTING!!!"
"The real reason for taking out Qualcomm is to remove competition. Qualcomm is licensing it 130,000 patents freely to anyone for a very fee. The Essential Standard patents portfolio is licensed under FRAND, an agreement between the patents holder and the Standards Organization, the Telecommunications Industry Association. All the patent holders, Qualcomm,Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, Nortel, Siemens, Motorola, and Alcatel must agree to license their Essential patents under FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) before these patents are included into the ""Essential Standards Portfolio"". The system has worked very well. The telecommunications industry is growing at a very fast rate and the technology is advancing beyond believes. The consumers are getting all the benefits of these technologies. It even make Apple the biggest company in the world. Qualcomm has over 150 licensees, and they all paid the fee. Apple is the only company that do not have a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm? Instead indirectly through its iPhone manufacturers. Destroying the licensing model will do great harm to the telecommunications industry. It will destroy the competition that we now all enjoyed with low priced cellphones of all mades and prices. There is no monopoly. Destroying the current licensing system will surely create an environment for future monopolies! Your opinions are welcomed."
"Seems like Qualcomm is a stock now that you can buy even here, and a few years from now it will have a 200 too 600% stock gain. There will be pullbacks from here to there, so I plan to add after every major pullback like what I did with Amazon, buying AMZN at 290 initially and adding every time it was hit more than 10% after that"
Is this a good time to open a position ?
"Months ago, big mouth said reduce your holding; now he said missing the party & don't buy it. Nothing is right except BS"
Rod Hall has it out for Qcom. He is a mid to low performer n probably has shorted the stock so hes trying to minimize his losses. You will see a big pop today.
Page 13 from the link : Qualcomm wants 1.3 bn USD late payment charge from Apple’s manufacturers in China....https://www.scribd.com/book/400152253
Why volume is so low for past 10 days? All waiting for ER before buying? Even I thought the appl pull back was for late joiners accumulating. But volume numbers does not say so.
It's a nice QCOM day today!
"Qualcomm QCOM, +2.80% reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $2.96 billion, or $2.58 a share, compared with $506 million, or 42 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were $1.45 a share, compared with 78 cents a share in the year-ago period. WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"
More than 3 months tank with amazing revenue and profit. The outlook is bright as well. I really don’t know what else is needed for a stock.
"Really liking those 1000 shares I purchased in the low/sub 50s several months ago, at the time it was all about the dividend. This whole patent thing, which I knew would be resolved in QCOMs favor eventually (I was thinking 2 or 3 years), is just icing on the cake!Should be hitting 80+ by the end of the summer, thanks AAPL!"
"We tested Sprint's 5G speeds all day so you wouldn't have to""Now it's Sprint's turn. In a bid to prove its 5G readiness, the country's fourth-largest network operator turned on its network in areas of Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Kansas City on Thursday. In the coming weeks, Sprint expects to launch service in parts of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. The company claims the roughly 2,180 square miles of coverage, which covers 11.5 million people, makes it the largest 5G network in the country.""""We timed how long it would take to download PUBG Mobile, a 1.86GB file.

As long as up a quarter everyday I am really happy
I thought BloackRock are the largest institutional investors in Qualcomm (~ 8.9% of the company). I also noticed recently that the BlackRock Co-founder and Director is an Apple Board member! How did the Boards of both companies allow this dispute between Apple and Qualcomm to go this far? This dispute is harming both companies in the long run in addition to risking US national security. Mind puzzling!
We may have to consider the possibility that Apple will go its own way with 5G chips soon as they are working on their 5G chip. They acquired Intel division in past and it's a matter of time.
up 2 bucks a share. now go to 3
Anyone knows the NXPI mergin agreement? Will NXPI must pay QCOM $1.3B if NXPI investors do not accept tender offer? or QCOM must pay NXPI $2.5B?
"I want a QCOM buy out but at $90, not $79. What is the best strategy to get that?"
"Prediction: qcom gives one final deadline to nxpi and the nxpi shareholders keep playing games. Qcom announces dead deal, qcom up to 80 and nxpi crashes, then qcom buys nxpi for 90 per share"
I'm still curious to see what happens when/if/after AVGO moves to the U.S. on 4/3. What if they still want Qcom? What then?
Q deserves class action by shareholders.
"Many may not like it, but Mr. Mollenkopf: like a rock. I try to imagine how it is, fighting Apple, Intel, Huawei, Avgo, FTC, nervous shareholders and not going insane over this nightmare. Seems, that he is clear what he wants...and gets it. He promised around 8$ EPS, if I’m not mistaken, he will deliver. Respect !!!"
"so glad I sold this AM, but I'll be back at a discounted price soon as the carnage is cleared."
4G was adopted and built out during the last 10 years beginning in 2009. 4G created a boom in smartphone sales due to 4G’s increased speed and lower latency bringing practical internet connectivity to smartphones. Smartphones was one of the fastest growing segments in the tech industry during the 10 year period. QCOM was the leader in 4G chips during the boom in smartphone sales as consumers bought 4G smartphones to replace their 3G phones. In the last 10 years the price appreciation for QCOMM verses the semiconductor index SOXX was 73% versus 354%. Will 5G adoption be any different?
I added to my leap call position yestersay. Qcom is going to be a winner.
"Qualcomm call volume above normal and directionally bullish 10:25 QCOM Bullish option flow detected in Qualcomm with 12,989 calls trading, 1.5x expected, and implied vol increasing almost 3 points to 39.87%. Oct-20 123 calls and Oct-20 118 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 3,700 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 0.22. Earnings are expected on November 4th."
When fab companies are spending billions on expanding their facilities to meet demand while QCOM sits in the back and makes money off royalties...
"Sam, know what you are saying but, don’t believe for a second that Qualcomm isn’t highly focused on the legal issue and one must believe (I do), Qualcomm has several different business plans in place to be able to rework there licensing agreements no matter what the government rules. They will adapt. It might be that the model alpha is talking about...Qualcomm knew when they started licensing that they were maybe pushing the limits. That’s why I am only suggesting they probably have many workable solutions."
The new CEO. Better come through with the next earnings report
"Hey gamestop is up 40%, I mean that awesome company that has such a great future and plays in the best technological revolution of today. LOL. This is where we are people, that is why you need to be patient and sanity will return within the next few months."
"I bought shares at $123 on Mar 08, and sell at 135.50 last March 22. Will be buying today for sure!!"
"TSMC and Qualcomm reportedly are moving to further cement their ties, with the pure-play foundry agreeing to fabricate a batch of rush orders of high-end 5G chips for the US chipmaker, according to industry sources."
SMH has been up slowly implies that QCOM TSM MU will rise again due to chips shortage badly!
"BRCM needs to be able to show the QCOM board a solid plan to overcome almost certain regulatory hurdles much greater than the NXP merger in mere 12 months. They need to address each of the overlapping technologies, their plan for divestiture of those divisions, and the creditable buyers already lined up to buy those tech/divisions. Anything short of that would be considered hot air. They need to address how they'll be resolving the various legal disputes, appeasing EU and China that 5G commitment will not be hindered with all the android OEM and carriers. Simply forfeiting away rights to patents or reducing licensing terms to pennies to appease the like of APPL is not an attractive way for BRCM to bring shareholder value back to QCOM investors. Talk is cheap, let's see some more details."
"What Qualcomm really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Qualcomm (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Qualcomm just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"SWKS was up again today on strong ER from Friday. It helped out all 5G companies, but Friday was a bad market day so most of them slipped off their high by the end of the day finished with small gains. SWKS is setting the tone now. QCOM will crush the numbers also. You could read between the lines when the new CEO was announced, they would not booby trap him with weak numbers. Plus Steve M is staying on as an adviser.Come 02/03/21 QCOM the big boy of this 5G build out will roar. Hoping for a huge up-day on ER!!!Good luck to all longs!"
"So, who’s the leader in mobile 5G chipsets in the end? This is an easy call. If you look at which company has the most products out in the market and the one with the most complete 5G mobile solutions, it’s pretty much no contest. Qualcomm has two generations of 5G modems shipping to customers and already has devices with their first-generation in the market. We’ll cover 5G devices in more depth in the next phase of this leadership series, but Qualcomm is currently the first one to ship a 5G modem and is already shipping their second generation of modems to customers. It also has both Sub-6GHz and mmWave commercially, which shows leadership due to solving the very difficult problems of mmWave. It also has numerous 5G front-end products in addition to its 5G modems, which collectively gives it the right to claim undisputed 5G leadership in mobile chipsets."
"Including CEO, six directors got 40% of the votes. This tells me CEO and his puppets should be in PIP or the puppets (including CEO) shd be part of 1B cost cut. Q needs a yesteryear Lee Iacocca of Chrysler or present year Satya of Microsoft. Sanjay Jha is a good bet."

"If Qualcomm loses the current trial, can it appeal?"
"My thoughts...from before... all together...Judge Lucy Koh decision and her action had so much errors and self-serving, she should be really be removed from her office. She failed to be a judge. Judge by definition should be unbiased, be fair, objective and be loyal to government and its people she is serving. She failed to do all these. She never should have presided over this case, since in her mind Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust and she went out of her way to make sure she was right. She found Qualcomm violated Sherman antitrust act for not being fair, reasonable and non discriminatory and found Qualcomm to be monopoly. Judge Koh however had no problem with these traits found in her action during this trial. Koh’s decision in trial was just bad interpretations with antitrust overreach using Aspen case as her model. I wonder how far she dug to find this rather unique case and its relevance? Really ski resorts to cell phone chips! Her policy was complete opposite of what it was meant to do...protect consumers. Her policy is anticompetitive, anti innovative and anti American.She wrote 233 page lengthy documentation which was planned from beginning to make sure Qualcomm not only was found guilty but also make it difficult to win its appeal. Even Qualcomm’s evidence of Apple’s slide prevention that clearly showed Apple’s plan to “hurt Qualcomm financially” was ruled inadmissible in appeal process without any explanation. This Apple’s plan was the very reason that started as result of Apple’s instigation that lead to FTC’s attention therefore should have been allowed without prejudice. I believe that she has the right to be socialist belief and her way of life, however it should have stayed out of US court room. I had chance to follow her court room through twitter few months back, and I was really appalled at how she Behaved. Only time will tell whether or not Qualcomm will win appeal at the Supreme Court , I do hope Qualcomm prevails since this will be not only win for Qualcomm but also win for all US citizen including Judge Lucy Koh!"
So does Bloomburger (I know it is misspelled) has it in for QCOM. Posting another article on how MSFT now is designing their own chips and pointing to QCOM as being the one effect on this which is not true at all.

Added to JP Morgan Focus List this AM
"Can someone help me understand this: ""Qualcomm notes in the press release that 56,605,079 NXP shares or about 16.5% of outstanding NXP shares have been tendered. That’s down from last week’s reported 65,276,925 or 19% of outstanding shares""How they can have less shares than last week? If you tender shares, can you get it back ? This sounds nuts."
Laughable rumor someone building modem chip just because it purchased dying division from Intel. Let me tell ya. There is no comparison in WiFi modem industry - only one company stands tall called Qualcomm
"Don't sweat A/H action. Earns were great, wafer capacity is a problem for major fabless players and QCOM uses massive amount of wafers - they sell every chip they make. Watch it roar back over next few days."
Anyone know what the pop is about this morning? Looked through the headlines but couldn't find anything positive?
"I find Christiano a better PR CEO which will help project QCOM to front and center with many investors. I mean Musk is the ultimate showman and PR dude, at least half of Tesla's cap is not about its technology it's about how Musk is presenting this technology that will impact the future of mobility."
"I see QCOM similar to how I viewed Apple and AMD in the past. Technology companies who were presumed washed up, but instead proved to have a 2nd much larger life. AMD and APPLE both had great leadership and didn't diverge too far from what they knew. Both were dead stocks which suddenly grew rapidly. QCOM was a CDMA company... providing communications for mobile phones. Did a very good job of this, but like AMD and Apple decided to expand their market and invented a communication technology unlike what they have been doing which will revolutionize how technology is used going forward. Not just mobile phones anymore, but how EVERYONE and EVERYTHING will become connected (devices, homes, businesses, phones, etc.). They brought on a known market builder who is also an engineer (sound familiar? So did AMD) to run the company during this expansion. Qualcomm is becoming and will be a new brand - they are investing in IOT and likely will end up with their own products. As Cristiano Amon famously said, we are only in the first inning. I will add to that and say, it is the first inning and no outs."
Last day before ex-dividend. Shares need to be bought today not sold.
"I bought 100 shares of Qualcomm on February 4th 1994. Several splits, big year in 1999 when I thought I was going to be a millionaire through buy out offers through code division multiple packets, through 3G, 4G and now 5G. Sold shares along the way and better price points than today.Better for all when companies work together. Better for America when politicians work together."

It is the games the Money Runners play! Hold your shares. They will re-buy when they get it lower! Don't be fooled!!
I bet -20% on ER day.
Not only phones rely on 5G. The autopilot in Booming EV industry also rely on the 5G chips.
"QCOM has a beautiful future with all 5G and 6G technologies in the pipe. This quarter is good but future quarters will be much better. Now US is invest heavily in 5G and may be 6G, QCOM, AMD, & TSM will be most valuable players."
Did Judge Lucy Koh's nephew have a short position in qcom?
"SIMPLE MATH. Most of us don't know the actual financial impact of the deal. HOWEVER, QCOM did say it will add $2.00 to the RUN rate of EPS. So we know Qcom sells at about 15 times earnings. So an increase of $2 should add about $30 to the stock price over the next few weeks. The market may get the stock there much quicker uo $18 today counting after market gains. Should that $2.00 run rate gain also increase longer term growth rate because of the 6 year deal, higher price are a strong possible. Near term target $89."
I think 155 tomorrow close what do you think? real predictions please
"Last month we were all saying how qcom was bouncing around 80, this month it's 90. Next month 100, January will be 110. I'll take this progress."

"Automakers and some other companies have complained that output is being hampered by shortages of some key components. Amon said Qualcomm, whose chips are at the heart of most high-end smartphones, had experienced much higher-than-expected demand.Separately, Qualcomm welcomes efforts to bring more chip manufacturing back to the U.S. The building of U.S. plants by TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. would help Qualcomm. The company would would also consider giving production orders to Intel Corp. if that company decided to open its factories to outsourced manufacturing, Amon said."

"Kingspellchecker, you’re implying that Qualcomm would rise 50% from here on a trailing PE basis since it’s currently 19.74X, which of course is $206, as mentioned. For this to happen, you would most certainly have to have QCOM trading upwards and away from whatever other semi chips are doing in which this stock hasn’t done this since 1999-2000 era. I actually believe they will earn $8.75 for full year being $2.17, $1.90, $2, $2.68z I just don’t see a trailing PE greater then 22.5X tops which should put it at roughly $197 but probably leading into the Q1 report in January. My opinion here is that this never sees a trailing PE of 30X even when they wind up growing close to if not 30% over the next few years on an annual basis."

TRUMP is actually doing a good things for US by not allowing China to get their hand into US top high profile technology. AndQCOM 5G is the only precious one that US Congress wants to protect at any cost! Things about it....that's why they did not allow AVGO to acquire QCOM last year!

"Meanwhile, on Wednesday the companies continued their arguments in court.Much of the testimony was over the patent that helps to direct traffic between an apps processor and modem, while also saving battery life. Apple tried to downplay the effectiveness of the technology in terms of power-saving.But Russel Jacob Baker, an expert witness called by Qualcomm and a computer science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said the patented tech saves 1.22 percent of power on smartphones. However, that's for smartphones in general, not specifically iPhones.""In the end, I think the numbers I came up with are fairly accurate,"" he said. He said he thinks the tech is ""very useful."""

"How Accelerated Share Repurchases work in simple words: bank partners of Q lease the stock from shareholders with a promise, to give back the shares to the original shareholders during the running time of the ASR program. After having leased the shares, the banks sell these shares to Q ( so Q has to pay for shares and therefor cash position goes down). The bank receives the money, Q the shares. Q then disposes the shares (therefor you see Q’s equity position to go down). So Q gas less cash and less equity. The banks, having received the cash from Q now buy shares on the market and give these shares back to the original shareholders ( and lease partners). It’s called Accelerated, because cash out and share disposal can happen quickly, whilst the share repurchase happens later and during the running time of the ASR....."
If this deal were expected to close QCOM would be selling much closer to $82.
Does anyone realize QCOM could make Apple obsolete? Try offering devices without 5G for the next three years. 5G is the WiFi killer. Adios Steve Cook!!
"In other words they are planning on making a higher bid, nice upside potential!"
Interesting how analysts haven’t said a peep about QCOM’s press event yesterday. From what I can glean from the slides it’s almost time to party like it’s 1999.
"Did Qualcomm Just Reveal A Key Piece of the New iPhone?Louis NavellierLouis NavellierThe race to 5G wireless is on – and if your mobile carrier isn’t already pestering you to upgrade to a 5G phone, they will be soon.Your first opportunity is the Samsung Galaxy S20, due out in March. It’s sleeker than the latest iPhone: thinner and lighter, while offering a larger display – and connectivity to the ultrafast 5G networks. While the iPhone 11 launch in September was all about “slofies” (and a third camera), Apple (AAPL) is said to be working on a more innovative iPhone 12 for its 5G debut this fall.All of this is made possible by the hardware inside. In my experience, great hardware is one of the best ways to profit from any tech boom – and that includes 5G. Let’s take a look at that today, because Qualcomm (QCOM) just announced its latest contribution to the 5G revolution. And Apple is sure to take notice.The hot new product Qualcomm announced today, the Snapdragon X60, is a 5G modem. Now, when most people think of modems, they think of something like this – the equipment that gets you online at home or work:But the modems we’re talking about here are actually tiny chips that go inside smartphones (and other mobile devices):Above you see an example from Intel (INTC), which in August sold a modem division to Apple for a cool $1 billion. Like its Chinese competitor, Huawei Technologies, Apple was more inclined to develop its OWN chips.Custom hardware is a hallmark of Apple products. But, in the meantime, Qualcomm is still its chip supplier for the next few years – and the new X60 chips prove that it can make them as small and as efficient as Apple (and other smartphone makers) could hope for.Qualcomm has not announced the exact dimensions of this year’s Snapdragon X60 chips. But we do know that it’s made of transistors that are just 5 nanometers (that’s 5 billionths of a meter!) in size.From the expert who ""recommended Google before anyone else"":Is this 5G opportunity like getting in on Intel in the early days? (Surprise Verdict)Money manager Louis Navellier says anyone who makes an informed ""bet"" on this ""Smart Antenna"" technology right NOW... could fast-track their dream retirement over the next 24 to 36 months. Go here for details.And Qualcomm’s making another key upgrade from the current X55 chips: This will be the first “to support spectrum aggregation across all key 5G bands and combinations.” We talked last time about how 5G will use new millimeter-wave technology, and basically Qualcomm will deliver chips that let you access 5G speeds in any of the different networks.With 5G chips that are more versatile, efficient and smaller than its rivals, Qualcomm is clearly a step ahead in terms of the technology. How about as an investment?Well, I’m actually taking a different approach to 5G in my Growth Investor recommendations.To help you see why, here is how QCOM is looking right now in my Portfolio Grader:QCOM earns top marks of “A” for its Quantitative Grade, which is certainly a strong point in its favor. But overall, its sales and profitability scores make for a mediocre Fundamental Grade of “C.”Add it all up, and QCOM does manage to ring in as a B-rated “Buy.” But I’ve got a better way to invest in 5G now.Grab the Biggest Slice of the 5G ProfitsAs amazing as 5G promises to be, it doesn’t get us anywhere without the right infrastructure in place. You can never stream Netflix (NFLX) using your smartphone plan (at any speed!) unless there’s a cell tower nearby.With 5G, those cell towers will be able to provide cable modem speeds (approximately 100mps) to wireless devices. Within two years, most cell phones will be 5G enabled and be able to wirelessly handle television streaming. In fact, with the 5G infrastructure market set to grow at an annual rate of 67% over the next 10 years, the entire market will go from $780 million to nearly $48 billion. This buildout is where I see opportunity now.Cable companies can do their best to fight back with fiber optics…but their services aren’t even available in many rural areas. And anyway, they can’t compete with the convenience of a smartphone, once it’s got ultrafast 5G. That’s how my 5G infrastructure play will capture more market share from the broadband cable companies.The stock I’m targeting is enjoying an influx of big money on Wall Street, and it has strong fundamentals, too – making it an A-rated “Strong Buy” in"

"History says rising rates come with higher stock prices""From our perspective, rising interest rates can mean that the bond market is correctly anticipating future economic growth and staying ahead of inflation — things that typically benefit stock prices,"" BMO Capital's Brian Belski said to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. ""A closer inspection of the data reveals that investors should welcome, not loathe, higher interest rates if history is any sort of guide.""In a recent note to clients, Belski observed that during seven prolonged periods of rising rates since 1990, the S&P 500 climbed at an average annualized rate of 15.1%.""The economy is recovering because earnings are going up; the fundamentals are improving,"" Belski said. ""So of course, interest rates are going to go up.""All that is to say that one worrisome variable like rising interest rates is no reason to think stocks should fall. Especially, when you can argue that variable is moving for other bullish reasons like an economy that's perking up."
I am very optimistic with qcom and the valuation is much better than many others in the semi space. I am long AMD and AVGO as well. Quite honestly I love AVGO as well. The dividend is awesome. AMD sorta scares me as the PE is much higher but it is a compelling growth story so I am hopeful that the story continues because a selloff would be brutal and much worse than the other two if they disappoint me. Overall I think the chips are in a sweet spot. What’s not to love when demand outpaces supply!

Who else is adding more stocks this morning? 70% of my portfolio is in QCOM. Excited to see growth not only in cellular but also autonomous and RF
They are in the forefront of 5G. They will have their suit against them thrown out on appeal in my opinion. This stock will be back in the 80's by the end of the month.
Where is the ceo. Wake up
"after reading article on how Qcom makes its money, its really simple and just a travesty that apple has been able to blackmail, conspire and continue to extort all this from the company that makes them billions. why can't qcom have several streams of revenue under 1 umbrella company?qct produces hardware and qtl is the brains behind it. not a crime. the cost per phone is paid by consumer in the I overall high prive of the gadgets called cell phones. is there an iPhone for $100 or less?"

"Not that it needs to be said but it wasn't trading at $57 because earnings estimates only allowed for that, it was trading at $57 because a loss to Apple could have destroyed the company so while 23% seems like a lot I would argue it only gets back the potential for the destruction of the company. Now you need to add the impact of the $2 earnings increase on top of that."

"The facts of the matter are that TXN, MXIM, XLNX, NVDA, CRUS are all trading with forward PE’s of at least 23x.

"If after earnings and the recent rise in the share price has begun to take shape then QCOM V shape run would be far from over. In my view, QCOM share price appears to make sense today at approximately $200+ than where it presently trades today. Which in my view should and could result in a straight and unobstructed run to my target in a more daily and straight V like shape to my target price mentioned. Recently there are some companies that have made approximately $100+ points in a very short time, but these same companies only appear to have further success with QCOM's technologies and what is evolving to become all new access to media through QCOM's technology which leads me to the shares presently trading undervalues in light of other positive results recently reported by the company during their earnings report and guidance."
"Forget your politics. I gotta wonder if Trump and Co recognize that they're facilitating the opposite of what they wanted. They sought to protect and enhance the u.s.'s prospects (e.g. via 5g) by what they felt was protecting and enhancing a u.s. company. Instead, that same company has been weakened by shareholder revolt, employee uncertainty, a management shakeup, wasted time on a former owner meddling into affairs with a pie in the sky acquisition idea, and worst of all, now having its own abilities to create a better strategy denied because of a response to that same govt. I agree w/ some things trump has done and disagree with others. But at times, I just flat out wonder if he sees the bigger picture and contemplates unintended consequences."
We also have to remember that the SMH and the SOX are both down >1.7%. Qcom down 2.4% prob means a good chunk of it isn't apple related.

"kohs decision will be overturned and Qcom will get paid handsomely through royalties. the fact that apple was able to buy the Necessary Technology in order to produce their own chips and Shores that there is a free market. They print money like nobody knows, and it's all because of the money Qualcomm spent on research and development. Apple has never spent a dime on research and development. what Apple is good at is marketing. they took a piece of plastic that played music bandwagon the idea to make it a phone that was only done possible with Qualcomm. there has to be a much deeper reason and $7 a phone for why Apple has chosen to go to war with Qualcomm on every single front. they make up the $7 but just raising the price to the consumer. And they never lower their price to the consumer. Why are they allowed to do this arbitrarily and never have to answer for any of their actions. they went so far as to slow down a Qualcomm product so it could match an inferior Intel product and reap billions in profits but nobody says a word. judge Koh was incompetent from the very start had no business even being involved in this on any level whatsoever. In the end and it will take time perhaps, Qualcomm the leader and all the technology Wireless will prevail"

And now, other companies like INTEL are going to benefit from all these feuds. Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in what will likely be a long and epic battle. Following news that Qualcomm had been charging heightened royalties for use of its tech, as well as reports indicating Qualcomm required Apple to pay a percentage of the iPhone’s revenue in return for the use of Qualcomm patents, Apple has sued the company in three countries.https://www.digitaltrends.com/business/apple-vs-qualcomm-news/"

We also note that Qualcomm provided some indication of how numbers were likely to shape up for the June quarter so whether the company will also choose to provide directional commentary for FQ4’21 to September will be important.

"One thing I find odd. While everyone knows that politics get played during trade negotiations, it's puzzling that China would so blatantly say that approval of the qcom/nxpi deal is a quid pro quo. Clearly that would run afoul of WTO or even general business practices. At least w/ the U.S. and ZTE, we can point to specific, serious and blatant violations. There is a reason for the U.S. actions on ZTE. But w/ China, they've pretty much said out loud that the holdup on qcom's deal relates purely to trade. I just find it really odd that no one is calling this out. Would seem to be good ammunition for the U.S. in diminishing China's business practices and environment. Guess I'm naive."

"Copied this from an article that indicates that they did a teardown on a new iphone 12 yo identify the QCOM chip and they seem to feel that Apple is going to be sticking with QCOM for years to come.Apple to Continue Qualcomm Chips, After X55 in iPhone 12 Will Use X60, X65 and X70 for Future DevicesApple is using the Qualcomm Snapdragon X55 modem in the new iPhone 12 lineup, a teardown has revealed. The report also says that Apple could be using the recently launched Snapdragon X60 modem in its future iPhones, and continue to partner with Qualcomm for its unreleased Snapdragon X65 and X70 chips. Apple and Qualcomm had settled a long-standing dispute last year and signed a multi-year deal and the new reports indicate that Apple will not be making their own 5G modems anytime soon.A teardown video comparison of the iPhone 11 with the new iPhone 12 posted by Century Weifeng Technology had confirmed that the iPhone 12 was using the Qualcomm X55 modem. The video has since been pulled from YouTube. The video had also claimed that the iPhone 12 housed a 2,815mAh battery which is 15 percent smaller than the one of the iPhone 11.A report by Mac Rumors, referencing court filings from the Apple-Qualcomm settlement last year, says that Apple plans to continue the partnership with Qualcomm for its next generations of devices. It says that Apple could launch new devices with the Snapdragon X60 modem between June 2021 and May 2022 — the expected timeframe of the next iPhone series launch — and the Snapdragon X65 and X70 between June 2022 and May 2024."
Until they replace the computer chip with a potato chip I'm in!#looooong
Last chance buy qcom at a discount. July 29 earning day. It may pass $100 on july 30
Monday we will find out the result.
"does anyone know if the stay is automatically granted pending the appeal , must qualcomm put a motion for it to lucy koh , or must the QCOM ask the 9th circuit to stay lucy's decision before the appeal starts ?"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-says-china-iphone-ban-003813739.htmlLooks like a settlement is coming in the immediate future folks.
"Qualcomm in talks with Honor to supply 5G chipsApple is shrewd to have entered a 6-year global patent licensing and chips deal with QCOM, or Apple may face a severe 5G supply shortage.https://www.gsmarena.com/qualcomm_in_talks_with_honor_to_supply_chips_honor_hopes_to_become_chinas_top_smartphone_brand-news-46675.php"
"So QCOM announced 30B buyback.. so who's shares are they buying back from and at what price? how much per share is worth after buyback considering there are 1,482,622,000 outstanding shares"
"Even without apple paying up, QCOM's prospects looks even better now that they can focus more on building out 5G networks and tech thanks to NXP deal falling through."
"This is PE contraction folks, based on higher taxes and eventual rising in rates. As noted from prior posts, Qualcomm can’t separate itself from the pack and so it gets hammered, even worse than other semi chips today"
"Qcom has basically gone nowhere for the last couple of years because of this Apple dispute, it has a lots a lots to catch up to.sure, it may pull back in a day or two, but Qcom is basically a 200 buck stock in a year or two, and I am more than happy to collect and reinvest a high div to wait for it."
"Qualcomm – The semiconductor company’s stock dropped about 4% in extended trading though the company beat analysts’ estimates on both the top and bottom lines. CFO Akash Palkhiwala said on the earnings call that there is significant uncertainty around what the coronavirus outbreak will do to the company’s supply chain, which relies heavily on China. The company reported first-quarter earnings of 99 cents a share on revenue of $5.06 billion while analysts expected 85 cents a share on revenue of $4.83 billion, according to Refinitiv."
And more shenanigans. They didn't get the 70% tender and are now extending the tender period.
QCOM getting 90+ dollars per phone for X55 5G chipset...
"Huawei to lose big in China phone marketThe US trade sanctions against Huawei are reshaping the Chinese smartphone market. Digitimes Reseach expects weak 5G mobile AP shipments to China in fourth-quarter 2020, with Huawei standing to lose more than half of its share in China's smartphone market to its domestic competitors. But Taiwanese PCB makers still expect steady shipments to China's 5G handset sector through November 2020, dismissing rumors about Chinese clients cutting orders. And IC substrate makers are set to scale up their shipments next yea to support AiP production for 5G mmWave phones."

"President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order next week banning Chinese telecommunication equipment from U.S. wireless networks, Politico reported late Thursday, citing three sources."
"Getting ready to bake in a fresh new low of the day. Down much worse then any other semi chips as if it was trading at an astronomical forward PE! This is not a liked stock. People might like the company, but it sure is easy to kick the  out of the stock"
"Can someone explain: stock barely unchanged (dow Jones nasdaq roaring). Whith updates etc, stock down 20$, why???"
"Stocvks like QCOM and AMD and NVDA are becoming more and more dependent on TSM's technology. Qualcom has some pricing power as their contracts with TSM are long term, but look to TSM to eat into these companies' margin as contracts renew and new programs are priced. I predict Margin will be under pressure once we get a little further into the semi shortage."
"Lordy, why didn't I buy more QCOM when the div yield was 5% and higher? dohhh...... QCOM has been paying and increasing their div for many years now, at a steady clip with great % increases. A div paying stalwart of tech ..."
130 entry :)
"Ok, folks a little history lesson! Apple a few years ago contracted Intel to make the 5G Modem chip for them (Apple). Well, in the mean time QCOM was working on Snapdragon 5G Modem chips. QCOM's new Snapdragons were a success, while Intels attempt ""Failed"", and Failed badly. Apple had to give in and buy QCOM's chips or they would not have a 5G phone worth anything. The next step Apple then bought from Intel the 5G division from Intel, at a fire sale price. The experts explained that QCOM's chips were 2 years ahead of the Intel chip. Nothing has really changed this cobbled together Chip division Apple put together is not experienced it mm wave length communication chips; QCOM wrote the BOOK on it!This nothing but Apple trying to save face as Tim Cook makes Apple money by cheating good suppliers, that is his back round; not a product guy like Steve Jobs! Also, Cook has been living with Egg on his face from this whole fiasco with Intel, he is holding a grudge!! Also QCOM has TCM locked up on 5nm and 7nm spacing, Intel/Apple bunch are hung up on 10nm, they are way behind the Experts! This is Apple bluster ignore it!!"
"So glad that we had an analyst give us a ""wimpy"" price reduction from $115 to $95 (with the stock at $65), while holding his BUY recommendation. One more analyst out of the way.........next."
"As I predicted, new lows of the day hitting like a slot machine takes longs money"
"SO IF THIS IS TRUE, SOME CHINESE MANUFACTURERS ARE GETTING QCOM CHIPS... Oppo Reno 5 series detailed, expected to feature unannounced Snapdragon 860 What’s interesting is that at least one of the handsets in the series could feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 775G or Snapdragon 860 SoCs – both of which have not been revealed by Qualcomm yet.AuthorHT TECH 22 Aug 2020, 04:53 PM IST in MOBILEOppo Reno 4 (HT Tech) Oppo has already launched the Reno4 flagship but it looks like the Chinese tech firm is already working on Reno 5 smartphones. This is hinted by a tipster on Weibo. The post suggests that the Reno 5 series may include the Oppo Reno 5, Oppo Reno 5 Pro, and the Oppo Reno 5 Pro+ models. Some information on the processor of the handsets have also been revealed. What’s interesting is that at least one of the handsets in the series could feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 775G or Snapdragon 860 SoCs – both of which have not been revealed by Qualcomm yet. sually Qualcomm reveals the processor, days or weeks before the arrival of first handset that features the chipset. We saw this happening quite recently when Qualcomm revealed its Snapdragon 865+ processor, days before Asus and Lenovo revealed their ROG Phone 3 and Legion gaming smartphones featuring it. Corning did the same with Gorilla Glass Victus before the Galaxy Note 20 announcement.Also read: Oppo F17 Pro with an ultra-slim design set to launch in India soonHowever, from the moniker it is safe to assume that Snapdragon 775G will be the successor of Snapdragon 765G while the Snapdragon 860 could be the slightly less powerful version of the current Snapdragon 865 SoC.What, however, adds weight to this claim is a report from earlier this month when a user on Weibo said that Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 was mentioned in a meeting that involved Oppo executives as well.But as per a theory, Qualcomm might not launch the Snapdragon 860 at all or is late to do so. if Qualcomm sticks with its launch plan like every year, it will introduce the rumoured Snapdragon 875 by end of this year. This doesn’t leave it with enough time frame to launch the Snapdragon 860. In addition, the model number suggests it to be the lighter version of Snapdragon 865 but Qualcomm is already giving Snapdragon 765G, which it launched alongside the 865 late last year."
"Exactly one year ago Rod Hall put out a sell on QCOM and a $61 price target. Today, he reiterates that sell with over double the price target. I guess if anything he is a ""try hard"" because the Excel spreadsheet he is using to value QCOM obviously has some issues. Just another MBA with spreadsheet and an opinion.."
I never looked at the dividend related dates as I just have them re-invested. Please let me know what ex-date and record date mean. Googled for those definitions but they are confusing. Record date mean one has to keep the shares as of market closing on that particular day ?
"Broadcom is accusing QCOM of more business dealings with China than themselves to dispute the issue with National Security...May be true as business dealing and partners, but QCOM was not being acquired by China and will it not be acquired Singapore....Apparently Broadcom and Hock Tan do not understand this basic fact."
"Shares short QCOM. A couple days prior to ER - short interest in QCOM was 13.7M. Since then a steady increase and as of 4/15 short interest is now 23.3M. Highest short interest in a year and probably ever. I would expect those shorting the stock have been trying to cover prior to earnings (and asked CJ and Rod to help), but as you have seen... any increase in volume for QCOM and the stock rises quickly. Not good if you are trying to close out short positions! Bring it on Cristiano!!"
"It is now well-established the QCOM management and its Board all conspire to advance the interest of their own, not that of shareholders. This point alone suggest all should be voted out and new management/ board established. This will take some concerted effort on the part of large funds that hold QCOM positions or another US co makes an offer."
They have to quantify and put a number in all these advancements. And innovations. What is the bottom line. Improvement.

"STILL, eps confusion. So in the piece from market realist below, they talk about how the co could quite possible achieve the 7.50 2019 eps guidance. This is just dumb because they're including the lump sum settlement w/ apple in that number. It's dumb because while for accounting purposes it will in fact work out that way. However the co's target was not intended to include this settlement. How could it? But my confusion still revolves around what the last full year forecast for eps from qcom was, and/or has there been anything in between the SM discussion of 2020 eps, which he used to fend off brcm?Qualcomm’s fiscal 2019 third-quarter guidanceAn interesting aspect of Qualcomm’s earnings results was its third-quarter guidance, which included the impact of its Apple settlement. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm will receive $4.5 billion–$4.7 billion in unpaid royalties from Apple, which is expected to increase its fiscal 2019 third-quarter generally accepted accounting principles revenue to $9.7 billion and its EPS to $3.67 at the midpoint.This payment from Apple will help Qualcomm achieve the midpoint of its fiscal 2019 EPS target range of $6.75–$7.5. If the chip supplier settles its dispute with Huawei in the next six months, it could achieve the upper range of its EPS target. (market realist excerpt below)"
qcom at 500 in 2 years. That's how these hot tech stocks work. Explosive growth. Don't forget to sell at 500. Don't ride it back down.
The modified Dutch Auction is complicated and shows that QCOM is desperate need of shares. I am not sure if it is for consolidation or boosting its key financial ratios. But they want shares pretty badly and the company is willing to pay a premium
This one is definitely forgotten by the market
Anyone knows about when the stay decision.?

"I’d be surprised/happy/shocked if it hit $155 after earnings this week. I don’t expect it, but I would welcome it. I’d sell if it got follow through to $160 though, as I think many would because of the huge short term gain. Then I’d wait back to $145 after the market correction I expect in May some time to get back in. I still believe market corrects 5-7% in May"
"I still think that Google should try to buy Qcom. Android phones use Snapdragons almost exclusively, 5G coming, Apple is in the process of removing all the Qcom silicon from iPhone anyways . Driverless car with NXPI, and they can better fight Apple on licencing , and most android manufacturers already pay Qcom on licensing , or spin off the licensing business if it runs into anti trust, Google has the money and stock to offer 90 to 100 bucks a share no problem"
"My April 1, 155 call is making me nervous..."
imagine selling at 136 at the close 
Hope AVGO announces another bid soon. Looks like QCOM is intent on staying independent. Going to do a stock repurchase if the NXPI deal falls through. Interesting presentation to release. And good timing.
"Before anyone panics with the Apple Iphone news - it only applies to the iphone 12 mini. If anything, this is good news for QCOM who makes more money with the higher end models. Apple’s new iPhones are still in high demand. Apple plans to build 230 million iPhones in 2021, up 11.6% from 2020, according to Nikkei Asia. But, the iPhone 12 mini isn’t selling as well as expected as consumers gravitate to either the older iPhone 11, which has a bigger screen, the larger iPhone 12 or the more premium iPhone 12 Pro models."
Thanks to those fear mongering Bears who sold me their 80 shares of QCOM in the past two weeks.
"I bought a couple times today, every $3.00 drop added to position!"
"Whether QCOM beats the numbers or not, the stock will be down. So, anybody wants to buy QCOM shares, hold your buy until tomorrow. Punishment will come today after the close."

Interestingly QCOM has come out and said it doesn’t matter what it is as going forward they already have agreements already in place for pricing. That said, Mr market should take this stock higher regardless of the ruling."
Low volume play.No worries.

robinhood targets the companies with big short positions. Hedge funds selling their qcom to cover their short positions in heavily shorted stocks I hope doesn't affect qcom stock too much.

"The Court was irresponsible and sloppy by defining monopolistic power and prices too high in the Q case. Based on the Court, it’s enough that competitors or clients claiming prices being too high. With these conclusions, a landslide of court cases will be the result. No wonder, that we have seen yesterday’s announcements reg. antitrust cases like Apple etc. Now it will come back to Apple full force, as their badmouthing reg. Q was a joke, looking to their own behavior in respect of AppStore or patent litigation. Think, that the announcements yesterday will make 9th circuit overthink the courts findings. Otherwise, we see plenty of court cases...."
With Hedge funds buying this stock will not run. I know it is counterintuitive but not really. These thieves with the MMs are keeping the stock in this range to load up before the next leg up. And the leg up will be epic. Just for food of thought guys PEG for NVDA is 3.44 for Broadcom is 1.71 and for QCOM is 1.18. For Tesla is now 17.99 (this is where some of us faint but that is what happens with the WOKE new investor I guess). Any way you look at it QCOM is the best deal and one of the best ways to play 5G

He also said the company’s agreement with Apple lowers potential risks of patent litigation from other industry players.WHAT STANDS OUT....

I have a strong feeling that INTC will be making a buyout offer very soon.I wonder what price would the board accept?
I have been a share holder for 20+ years and never sold a single share. I am an engineer and read Jacob’s CDMA book before I bought my shares. Now I feel the company can finally fulfill its potential to become a 500B MC company a few years from now.

"Even they beat speciation the slightly difference was due to chips shortage and that’s a good problem !Qualcomm shares dipped as much as 9% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as the company said that semiconductor supply constraints that have roiled the industry contributed to fiscal first-quarter sales that slightly missed Wall Street expectations.The results come as chip shortages force automakers such as General Motors Co on Wednesday to cut production at multiple plants. While Qualcomm does not make the chips that are holding up automotive plants, the company works with some of the same chip contract manufacturers that are backed up, and Qualcomm executives told Reuters that supplies will remain tight through the first half of 2021.

I'm confused...there is a $70 buyout offer on the table and the stock is at $63??? What am I missing? We know how offers work that normally the buyee trades higher than the offer. Not happening here and I'm not sure why...
Retail investors don’t understand that the free investment articles the show up on Yahoo etc coming from the likes of Bloomberg or Motley Fool are likely being highly manipulated by hedge funds to help them either get into a stock cheap or sell at a peak. How do free articles get funded? Hedge fund A contacts media outlet B and offers $$ for an article with a certain spin. Media outlet publishes the article suppressing the stock price which enables hedge fund to get in at lower price offering an immediate return on investment.

Itc trial is just noise for day traders. Qcom will win trials against Apple as already have in China, Germany and even in the USA (although judge didnt allow ban on iphones). Apple will have to pay at least $7 billion in the USA plus X billions around the world.Apple is just buying time, and waiting for the ITC trial to see if it can pay less to settle afterwards... point is Apple will pay something, and anything is better than nothing... Qcom already has no revenue from Apple so anything will be a win.Also find hard to believe ITC will force Qcom to license to chinese companies!!"

"Not licensing chip competitors isn’t anti competitive. They can sell modern chips for free. Qualcomm takes a % of phone price as a royalty because it is their patented technologies that enable the network to work. Being paid for your patent rights Is not punishable by Anti trust. Enforcing patent rights (royalties) at a device level instead of a component level is also not anti competitive. No consumer harm, no industry harm, royalty rates have fallen, chip prices have fallen, technology has improved significantly. Plenty of healthy competition in the modem market. What exactly will the benefits be of all these orders that Lucy declared against Qualcomm? What makes her fit to determine how the industry should work. She’s a social studies major. The only consequence of her ruling, if it stands, is to stunt the advancement of wireless communications. Bravo Lucy."

"Tim cooks arugument is simple yet apple does not follow its own argument. App store in iphone...how come vendors has to pay 30% percent license fee to apple. Vendors call it apple tax. Yet apple does not want to pay license fee to qualcomm. Only difference is software to hardware, but basically same thing. Apple is 800 pound guerrilla and qualcomm 40 pound chimpanzee, basically apple is crying that qualcomm is taking too much. Who is bully who? Apple is trillion company and qualcomm just 1/10 the that and apple is using thier dominate power to avoid paying license fee which apple has agreed to pay for qualcomm innovation.Regardless how much it took to develope a app apple charge 30 percent tax. Qualcomm wants to charge percentage of the iphone selling price rather than just price of the chip. Apple arugment is since apple bought the chip apple doesnt have to pay anything else however apple just bought the hardware and not the right to use it. Its like when you buy the app but sometimes there’s In-app purchase you must purchase to fully use the software. Its like Apple agreed to buy in-app purchase and does NOT want to pay for it after they use to make money."
I've read about the sourcing of chips by apple from qcom and samsung in a couple of places. It seems maybe the market is getting it a little confused. Or maybe I am. I understood it as qcom will primarily be used for mmwav and samsung for sub6 and that mmwav is the primary network for 5g. Techies?

"Let me get this straight. Judge Koh, who ruled against QCOM is Korean-American, and LG (a Korean company) is objecting QCOM's request to stay Koh's antitrust ruling against QCOM. Add to that Koh's refusal to admit certain evidence to prove QCOM was not engaging in anti-competitive behavior.Seems this is a textbook example of conflict of interest and judicial bias. QCOM should not only easily get a stay but an easy turnover on appeal."
"QCOM becoming beginning to work much more closely with Google, AI, Iot and 5G stuff. Apple going to go it alone and try to own the world......after they write a very large check. God bless them."
I bought 35 shares of QCOM today.
Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit 2018 Live coveragehttps://www.qualcomm.com/company/events/snapdragon-tech-summit
Goldman talk at 11:10 Central today. Link is available on company website.
"New numbers. QCOM says the QCOM/NXPI will bring $5.25 in earnings plus another potential $1.25 from AAPL. AVGO says the numbers are $4.50 and $1.00. If we use 20x the $4.50, we get $90. If we include the $1 and use a 15 multiple, we get $82.50. That is using the AVGO numbers. QCOM is probably correct that AVGO is undervaluing the company, but looking at the past stock performance, $82 is still attractive to investors. All-on-all, I think AVGO still wants QCOM and will make a new bid, hopefully pre-negotiated with QCOM so they can have a definitive agreement. What gets it done? I think AVGO can easily go $91.25 ($60 plus .125 shares). Let's hope common sense abounds on both sides and AVGO, QCOM, and NXPI shareholders can all come up winners."
problem is that this is dead money for a few weeks. perhaps even a sell back into the high 50's as people realize that nothing will happen for awhile. No way to they come out with a higher bid until the bod has responded. if they reject the offer then it could tank a few points. if they accept then it could go up a few. either way there won't be much movement for a bit. probably will reject and price will fall into the 50's then maybe they come back at 75 per share. But that might take a month.
"Dad gone it ! I was wanting a decent pull back , I need more QCOM, maybe it will open up down in the morning"
Here is the PE for these companies who compete in same field:QCOM : PE 35AMD: PE 43AVGO: PE 73NVDA: PE 88Oh yeah QCOM also has the highest earnings. Say thanks for the dip and load up! This will be above 200 next Q.

QCOM business is over. FTC will be cracking down revolutionary American company and give opportunity to Chinese company to lead mobile and its adjacent market.
Stock down 3.77% Thanks to QCOM
QCOM should be $165 at least at this point. Getting 100% of Apple modems plus 5G dominance plus new infrastructure and automotive business potential. Compared to AVGO that has 30% higher PE and none of the growth drivers.
"Qualcomm kicked off its annual 5G Summit by revealing its latest chipset for high-end smartphones, the Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile platform, set to be used by device makers Honor, iQOO, Motorola, Oppo, Realme, and Xiaomi.The company claims the Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile platform offers enhanced photography and mobile gaming using AI.For gamers, the new chipset promises 30 per cent faster input response, with the GPU upgraded to boost power efficiency without sacrificing visual fidelity.Qualcomm explained AI improves the quality of video calls and reduces background noise.The Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile platform runs the X53 5G Modem-RF System, which is produced using a 6nm process.Qualcomm also announced upgrades to its Snapdragon X65 5G modem-RF system, including a wider 200MHz carrier bandwidth in mmWave spectrum which the company explained will be important as Chinese operators deploy the frequency, building on their current launches using lower bands.“We are empowering the ecosystem to bring next generation Rel-16 5G products as early as late 2021 and helping create new business opportunities across computing, CPEs, XR, gaming, industrial IoT and beyond”, said Durga Malladi, SVP and GM of 4G and 5G.Malladi added Qualcomm expects half a billion 5G smartphones to ship this year, and noted network rollouts are progressing faster than LTE, with 150 operators globally having deployed the next-generation technology."
"Today's smear by AVGO shows that Hock might not have gotten the CFIUS message fully. U.S/Trump Administration loves selling goods, license patents etc to China as long as we are in the driver's seat and we are in the lead. We love it when the Chinese line up outside of Apple store or line up behind QCOM to prepare for the 2019 5G roll-out because that fits the American products/tech MAGA mantra.It is not about having business relationships with Chinese OEMs or paying NDRC fines and partners with them on JV with encrypted IPs that pose a risk to national security or national interest. It is about damaging a strategically important U.S leadership by putting QCOM in limbo mode for 18 months during the hostile merger and knowingly hand over the leadership to our frenemy. Once huawei or Samsung take a 6 months lead on 5G, it'll be a hard up-hill battle to try and catch up.Yes, the term frenemy correctly describes the relationship between the U.S and China. The two countries depend on each on trade amongst many other thing, but at the same time they are our strategic opponent. Painting QCOM has having close working relationship with China to sell, promote and license American products does very little to appease the original security concern for this takeover."

I believe for all the reasons noted in these messages over the last week, that our earnings, will be absolutely blow out.

Not traction in the 90s—slowly slipping backwards while moving forwards to the earnings call next week. Mollen selling 1/3 of his stock stake damaged investor confidence.
"Qualcomm has won all of its court battles, including the right to charge license fees in China, a crucial win.“Through it all, Mollenkopf’s approach was mostly to not get caught up in the moment, hunker down, and focus on the product roadmap,” according to Bernstein’s Rasgon. “And while controversial (and painful) at the time, looking back with the benefit of hindsight we have to admit that the approach was probably the right one for the long term.”Under Mollenkopf’s leadership, Qualcomm’s stock first slumped as the legal battles mounted, but later rebounded to end 2020 at $152.34, more than double the price when he took office. The company is on course to record sales of $30 billion this year, according to the average of analysts’ estimates.The main point here is bcnc ran an untrue article this morning and this post sets it right.This is the item they had wrong! Qualcomm has won all of its court battles. Yes they won all their court battles!! Sent Lucy Koh packing! BB corrected this item in their article."
more downgrade coming after ER.
"One step forward, ten steps backward."
"Regardless of good or missed target earning and/or good or lower forecast. If good earning and strong forecast, stock will be down 5%-10%. IF forecast is missing, will down 10%-15%. Wall Street is the criminal that our SEC creates rules for short sellers. This is a joke this market."
"Guess investors listen to Citi and not Don or Lie Kin, huh? Weird since those two spend such an inordinate of time on QCOM stock analysis and predictions. Maybe some day they will work for Citi and people will listen, unless of course one of them is made CEO of QCOM!"
"BEING DOWN THIS MUCH FOR MISSING BY A SMALL FRACTION IS REDICULOUS. STILL A SOLID COMPANY AND 5G IS JUST BEGINNING AND THEY ARE IN MANY MARKETS, INLCUDING THE EMERGING AUTONOMOUS MARKET FOR AUTOS. BUY ON THIS DIP, QCOM IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE."
"When Koh rules against FTC, QCOM pops 10%Gotta be int it, to see $55+SHORTLY////soon////// Last call."
Why does he keep emphasizing litigation costs the more says that lower does the stock go
"Management should probably support the stock a little here with either a statement (supply is good, etc) or a small buyback..etc. Or they may just wait for ER... regardless this is will bounce hard north within six weeks and likely sooner as we get close to end of quarter."
"Good value here. While many companies, including startups that make no money, are overpriced, this money making, tech juggernaut is undervalued."
"AAPL, QCOM, Samsung and others has a new competitor Nvidia?"
"Remember my friends. As it relates to Broadcom purchasing Qualcomm. BROADCOM IS APPLE. The price Broadcom can raise their bid to, is not the question, because they have pools of low cost capital to get a deal completed. APPLE has a special fund called. LOW COST MONEY AVAILABLE TO ANY COMPANY THAT CAN END QUALCOMMS ROYALTY MODEL. Broadcom is Apples chimp. Qualcomm is not Apples chimp. In many ways Qualcomm, is the last entity that Apple does not indirectly control. So I think more smart people are going to come to the understanding that Qualcomm remaining independent, with NXPI digested is very healthy for continued innovation and competition."

Do not forget the tech shavy analysts who kept downgrading. The most obvious manipulation ever. As far as I am concerned such practices should be subject to litigation both against the analyst and the institution they work for.
you can bet it's conveniently reissued by the likes of goldman and the short funds they front for.
Keep in mind Bloomberg is often a shill for hedge funds looking to either enter or exit a position. They are known for timing articles to manipulate stock prices. In this case I wouldn’t be surprised if they aren’t doing this for Goldman who has obviously missed the boat on QCOM.
This is what they call in the stock market as an inflection point Qcom still has a huge runway to run
"Bloomberg: Apple's Cook will be deposed in Qualcomm suitApr. 5, 2018 4:53 PM ET|About: Apple Inc. (AAPL)|By: Brandy Betz, SA News EditorApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook will be deposed on June 27 in the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) lawsuit, according to Bloomberg.The suit accuses Apple of “lying to regulators in order to spur investigations of Qualcomm. Apple had filed complaint over chip royalties.” Qualcomm shares are up 0.7% aftermarket."
"It looks like Intel have been dragged into this situation by Apple, Intel does not want to be in modem chips business they failed at it earlier in 3G 4G, lost $200M in the last 3 months (see earnings) providing Apple's modem , they are behind at least 12months in 5G, Intel 10nm mfg challenges continue. Now they are dragged into legal issues of using Q's code provided by Apple illegally (court case Pending). In addition Apple unhappy with Intel’s chip performance. Probably they would be very happy in any settlement and reduce their loses cause by Apple’s modem business."
They are in a hurry to buy before this gets over $100
"I’m no expert in chips. I don’t know anything about Display Integrated Circuits. I don’t know how 5G works. But I do know this stuff is needed and QCOM is in the middle of it all. I hate reading all these articles and all they want you to do is click on a link or subscribe or whatever. I’ve beaten the overall market by a lot, you know how? By using common sense. QCOM is under 20PE and making like $8B with 50% growth. Investors are favoring Dogecoin and ARKK type stocks this month. Nothing wrong with that. I’m buying options on QualComm. Calls and Call spreads. This should be a $240 stock right now and a $320 stock in a year or two. QCOM is out of favor right now. Wait to hear the news next week or next month. Imagine what it is. NOW is the time to buy, not when QCOM is in the high 200’s. Buy now while it’s out of favor."

"Qualcomm has considered splitting the company in two several times. If the FTC case goes against them, that becomes a more real possibility which will allow Qualcomm to salvage full value out both the licensing division and the chip division. As a result, I dont see a negative FTC ruling hurting Qualcomm significantly. Of course, a split would only happen after Qualcomm exhausts all appeals."
Qualcomm should drop bid for NXP and mega-merger with Qualcomm. A huge challenge with the worldwide government due to Chinese investors behind the scence. Most of the huge mergers ended up in disaster.

I hope that Qualcomm is using the remaining money allocated for the share buyback to buy at these levels before the sales of the new modem and the Snapdragon chip sales are reflected in the earnings. I cant see the price staying at this level very long. It should be at least in the mid 60's to low 70's by May.

"Oh, and EU regulators indicated recently that licensing guidelines pertaining to ""standards-essential patents"" such as those held by QCOM will soon be released and will generally be favorable to QCOM in that QCOM will have no obligation to license Apple and QCOM will be allowed to charge ""whatever the market will bear"" . With over 280 QCOM Licensees today, what the market will bear is well established., Maybe we'll get to see what an iPhone X with 2G connectivity will sell for. My guess is ""Not much""."
"Found interesting article from techspective dated august 3 and this is excert from it....At the heart of one of Apple’s arguments is that the method Qualcomm uses to charge for technology is so onerous that success is impossible thus the reason they aren’t paying their bills. Yet, not only are Qualcomm’s charges barely material to Apple, they are paid successfully by Apple’s smaller competitors (who often are charged much more as a percentage of revenue than Apple is as a function of volume). And, were what Apple is alleging true, then Qualcomm would be approaching a trillion dollar valuation–not Apple. Given this massive disparity in financial performance, revenue, profit, and valuation it looks like Apple is massively overcharging and not Qualcomm. The one huge difference is that Qualcomm is charging Apple, who once again isn’t paying their bills, and Apple is charging you.This kind of suggests that Apple believes that anyone under a contract that believes they are being overcharged should be able to simply not pay their bill. What if every Apple customer decided to follow Apple’s lead and not pay their bill until Apple lowered the cost of their phone and service back to where it used to be for the original iPhone?Now you’d be right to argue that if you didn’t pay what Apple wanted they wouldn’t sell you a phone, but Apple seems to argue that it would be unfair if Qualcomm did the same."

"I am not a technical trader by any stretch, but for fun I looked at some the key indicators (Bollinger Bands, MACD, AROON, etc.). They ALL are showing a trend reversal and bullish indicators. I especially like AROON as this has been pretty accurate - it signaled to sell a few days before Feb 2! Now signaling to Buy. In addition the volume is dropping - which normally precedes an explosion and we know which way it will go. I expect we have to get past OE Friday and next week the trend begins ...or worse case after ER. Probably will need an ""event"" to trigger it which will trigger key buy signals from traders and institutions and QCOM will be above 162 in a hurry."

"The QCOM stock price hasn't been above $82 per share since 1999. Prior to the Broadcom offer QCOM was languishing. To not meet and negotiate with Broadcom is irresponsible.

If you want $82+ per share call QCOM on Monday morning and make your voice be heard.John Sinnott is the VP of Investor Relations and his number is (858)658-4813.

I think AVGO still very much wants QCOM and will not stop till they acquire it. Calls are in effect.
"Three days ending Apr-14 sure looks like an 'ABC' down. Wonder how many shares were shaken loose. I picked up a little more today. 180 possible if big beat Apr-28, IMO."
"CFIUS authority, according to the Federal Register, runs to foreign entities controlled by foreign persons that are seeking to control a U.S. entity. It states that a foreign entity is one that is controlled by a foreign person as judged not solely or primarily by its location or address but by its ownership, management, board, etc. and the exchange on which the majority of its shares trade. Given that AVGO's CEO and Board are overwhelmingly American citizens and its shares are traded on NASDAQ and its owners are primarily U.S. based institutional funds, I think there is a strong argument that CFIUS doesn't even have authority now. Certainly there will be no argument for CFIUS authority after April 3. I think the unprecedented CFIUS action prior to the agreement even being in place was driven by politicians in CA worried about job losses in San Diego."
Positive comments on 5G smartphone demand from David Zinsner Micron's CFO at todays Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference.
"FTC will normalize their position, this stock is a gift to longs"
"In April’s settlement, Apple agreed to use Qualcomm modems for the next six years, with an option to extend the relationship another two. That gives Apple up to eight years to perfect the smartphone modems Intel was struggling with and get them up to par with Qualcomm’s technology. Even though Intel had a history of building modems that didn’t perform as well as Qualcomm’s, Apple now has plenty of time to improve the technology before the clock runs out. (source CNBC https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/apple-spends-1-billion-to-buy-intel-modem-business.html)This means Apple will still be using Qualcom chips for the next six years. Doesn't this mean the sell off due to Apple buying Intel an over reaction or a buying opportunity? JMHO."
"apple is bent on not paying anything to anyone if they can get away with it regardless of laws, patents, contracts, PERIOD..they have leverage like no other has ever had and feel they can do as they please. they need to be brought to justice."
afraid qcom in trouble here because nvda is up big td
Is 5G being over-hyped?Do folks really need faster speeds and a new phone?I am wondering.
"Revenue is accelerating, and while maybe not tomorrow, this is above $100 easily before next report."
Thumbs up for qcom win or thumbs down for FTC win
EU news also suggest that Qualcomm may not be obligated to license Apple to use its technology. this will clearly strengthen qualcomm's hand against Apple.

QCOM will be 150.. soon.
We still have some legs ... should be up to 95-100 before earnings .. then when Apple announces new Iphone release date it will move to 110 in fall!!
"Congrats, Steven Mollenkopf. You somehow managed to lead a big tech down in the 2017 tech bubble. Bravo"
FTC has rested its case. qcom's turn. Better be good.
Why up after hours on good volume?
"If the price breaches 76, head for the hills."
"Today's WSJ Headline: ""Huawei looks to enhance its US image"" - page B3. A good first step would be to settle its controversy with QCOM and pay QCOM the $$ it owes!"
"I do believe there is something there to the rumor. Let’s think about that for a moment to be in the shoes of Intel. Apple currently is using Intel for the iPhone modem, it stops using the Qualcomm chips in its IPhone. It had maintained a dual supplier relationship (QCOM and Intel) for quite some time until Intel could stand up on its own). Apple has to slow down the QCOM chips iPhones to make both phones have similar performance. Intel has really made strides in the development in mobile chips, and its almost caught up with QCOM in the LTE world. Broadcom is supplying the RF components to the iPhone, and it has a great relationship with Apple. If Broadcom successful buys QCOM, and IF Hock Tan cuts a sweet deal with Apple to 1.cut licensing costs, 2. Be the exclusive supplier for both modem chips and RF components to have a seamless integration in the iPhone, this would be a major threat to Intel’s mobile communication’s revenue.For the reasons listed above, I do think Intel WILL need to do something to disrupt the potential edge that AVGO would have in buying QCOM, and I think it has been brainstorming on what to do, and the rumor that AVGO is being targeted by Intel is probably an internally leak from its behind the door brainstorming. Should we pretend we were Intel and try to do some scenarios planning of our own?Ie.Intel buys AVGOIntel buys QCOM"
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM): Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.96 beats by $0.04.Revenue of $12.92B (+25.4% Y/Y) beats by $240M. It's not QCOM but a good forecast of the sector.
I believe QCOM is the must own company in the 5G space. They are essential to so many of its aspects. In addition they continue to acquire companies that further strengthen their position.
It's quite likely that the Huawei lobbying effort is about to payoff soon here given the recent settlement announcement. The timing would be way too coincidental. These rumors tend to lag by a couple weeks. $120+ easy next week.
"Anyone know if San Jose is considered Northern, Central or Eastern Cali? Here are the appointments of judges for each district. We can see if they're predominantly Bush, Obama or Trump appointees. https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view_council.php?pk_id=0000000898"
QCOM's downward trend is over. Good luck shorts.
"I don’t think nxpi acquisition is a good idea.However, Qualcomm board think it’s eminent, re-negotiate cash tender offer below 90.No penny more!!!"
"This was not the Quarter Qcom was going see improvement.. we were all waiting for the 5 G effect to start next year for a multi year cycle as 5G build out to start. The fact we are seeing earnings/ sales effected now .. this is very positive sign. I see perfect storm ahead .. Trump will start reducing tariffs (election year), 5 G will really start to be adopted and legal trouble can improve (not sure about this one .. but the fact Qcom is buying back stock is a good indicator)Why would anyone sell this now.. unless ur a trader not an investor!!"
broadcom/apple takeover is probably not happening as it will squeeze out android.
Consumers in the UK could be owed a collective £482.5m ($678.1m) in damages from multi billion-dollar tech giant Qualcomm.
"Nobody wants to believe PE adjustment due to higher rates/inflation in the coming months, but whatever. Throw in higher corporate taxes and there you have it."
I think QCOM facing too much competition . Any intelligent comment please .
"Looking at the relative strong performance of the stock price during last week, the market expects a positive decision on the stay for the next days, as all formal aspects from Q and FTC are fulfilled."
looks like we gonna close at $60 
What do people think about the department of justice saying any punishment for qcom should not hamper 5g?
Top companies with china revenue exposure. 1) Wynn Resorts 73% 2) Qualcomm 65% 3) Broadcom 54%
Calls being bought hard.
"Even if the earnings are good, QCOM is not going up. The bears are in control after yesterday's sell off without reason."
Im a little worried with Google desining its own chips going forward with Whitechapel and Appl already on it. Can someone give me one good thing coming up cause their 5G was mostly based on phone chips whereas other chip companies are more on autos and iot.I know qcom has abit on it as well but dont think its as good though right?
"I was down 1,000 dollars last evening and sad. I truly felt like this was wrong, I do a lot of research before I invest into a company and to wake up to to QCOM in the green really made my morning so much better..."
"hopefully new ceo, Amon carries the ball to touch line. qualcomm can do better and qcom stock got already punished few times due to management mistakes."

I think I've muted Dave twelve times and he still comes back. What is the purpose of the mute button?
"QCOM has much higher expectations than NVDA,AMZN,FB, GOOG"
looks like the two of the best companies are going to absolutely explode by this summer. apple will be 150+ and qualcomm will be 180+. loaded!
It’s all abt the patents guys. If Apple can’t win the patents no one can.
Poor guidance. Will drop below 140 tomorrow. Qualcomdey always.
"Amon with E Savitz on Barron’s Live at 12 ET today, Techtrader: 5G is here"
We need a NEW Board and CEO!!!!
"Since the ruling between FTC and Qcom is likely gonna be a two fold win vs lose - no settlements; I did some research on Judge Koh and found this article from a year ago; article brings sheds some light on Judge Koh’s position and why she denied a settlement. Not the easiest to read, but does show that qcom could be in real trouble. http://www.fosspatents.com/2017/06/judge-koh-shows-way-frand-non.html?m=1"
I am hoping QCOM close above $92 today and above $100 after hours tomorrow!
Going negative....
"Tests of 5G smartphone downlink speed in the US and UK by Ookla show that smartphones using the 5G millimeter wave bands, on average, achieve blazingly fast downlink speeds 20 times that of 4G LTE. To date, only Qualcomm supplies mmWave chips used in smartphones, but the tests show that the fastest 5G smartphones operating in the sub-6GHz bands use Qualcomm cellular radios as well, according to Strategy Analytics.""Millimeter wave 5G not only offers blazingly fast speed, it offers operators massive capacity when deployed in high-traffic areas, and allows operators to roll out new services such as fixed wireless broadband access and indoor private networks within their coverage footprints, making more efficient use of the 5G core network,"" said co-author Guang Yang of the Strategy Analytics network provider strategies service. ""Qualcomm's millimeter wave chips for smartphones and other user equipment make this possible."""
"it is interesting how people are not well informed about QCOM no matter how much tweets and blogs they read, this company is the absolute strongest real leading edge technology company that will alwayse win in the end because they stay true to their values which be the best in what you do and be the best wireless company on the world, alwayse. Hok tan have no choice but to save face, he is not going to have it .... NxP shareholders, we are all enjoying the movie that will end soon, and Apple, I wish Steve Jobs was still alive.. enough said, the caravan will continue to move in the dessert and the dogs will keep barking."
"I cant see how the FTC can win. If they won, it would help Huawei and hurt Qualcomm. I dont think that the Trump administration would allow this to happen based on his strong support for US firms and his prohibition of Huawei technology sales in the US."
"Making the case for owning QCOM, this review by Stockopedia in my opinion hits all the check points.What's the future for the Qualcomm Inc share priceGiven the uncertainty hanging over the economy, it is more important than ever to identify high quality stocks for your portfolio. That means knowing how to find highly profitable companies that are able to fend off competitive threats over the long term.These sorts of stocks are different because they've got what billionaire investor Warren Buffett calls economic moats. Seek out the article, because, they cover point by point and at the end gives a link to offer differing positions, so it's very positive IMO."
"When the bulls run this thing, they usually run it pretty hard. If it crumbles the $155 coupled with some upgrades, it can top $200 in pretty quick order. If you sold calls, you better cover or not go naked!"
"Today’s price is the same as it was 6 years ago during March 2014. Shouldn’t the price be higher after 6 years of increasing stock dividends, stock repurchase buybacks, leveraged debt, and cost-cutting of non-core business units?"
"Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, -6.22% shares were among the biggest laggards in the chip sector following reports that noted Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.26% analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities told clients that the smartphone giant plans to start using its own 5G chips inside its phones as early as 2023. Apple gets its 5G chips from Qualcomm and as recently as 2019, paid Qualcomm nearly $5 billion in a settlement over the chips."
How long to come back to 92? It can easily go down $3 a day but only go up $3 a day on an upgrade or a massive news like Apple's settlement.
great looking chart. Held 200 and 50 day move averages after big move after eps report. Guidance v good. Time to buy if you are not in!
"i think the 2020 guidance, if provided, is going to be more telling than the current year. there's still some ramping, and at least this quarter won't have any apple, plus who knows how the one timer will be reported. there's def noise in 2019. so the 2020 number is going to be really interesting....again, if they provide it. 7.50? 8 bucks?? wouldn't that be sweet?!"

Remember Star trek we are heading to the interplanetary space era and Qcom leadings 5G to 10G technology will take us there and will be the first trillion dollar company in twenty years.
"Based on my study to QCOM, AMD, NVDA, and INTC, the following results can be concluded:1. 1 yr price for QCOM is $228 (low), $280 (average), and $465 (high).2. QCOM is the relatively cheapest stock among them on the basis of combining P/E, forward P/E, profit margin, revenue, quarterly revenue growth (YOY), and quarterly earning growth (YOY).3. The QCOM P/E is 23.28, which is similar to that of a traditional industrial stock. Based on this low P/E, high growth in both revenue (62%), and high earning (165%), I believe that Qcom will have a limited space to pullback even if the overall market continues to pull back.I believe that QCOM will have a 2:1 split soon."
"There have clearly been outright lies on both sides. I also understand that employees are concerned about there jobs and that shorts want the stock to tank. But, any rational investor should want the deal to go through. The offer price is far beyond where this stock can trade in the next few years absent the deal. AVGO has made concessions on every issue brought up. QCOM had issues with interim control and regulatory approval - those (as per QCOM) were addressed (""all issues except price have been addressed"" FT article). There were concerns on price - AVGO has raised the price twice 70, then 82, then 79/82 (the 70 was an increase when debt is included). Now there are national security concerns. It appears AVGO is addressing those."
how about another 4 dollar day if hedge funds cover. 131 would be nice
Keep saying . Needs management change.
"Serious questionI’m no CPA or balance sheet genius, but...Why is QCOM buying back all of these shares from the banks when they have billions in debt on their balance sheet?Is the debt secured by these shares?Seems odd to me if not.Has QCOM stated why they are doing this?P.S. I’m long QCOM"

"For these two companies, pretty much a quiet day. Hopefully they are negotiating towards a final deal. Any deal will obviousluy be over AVGO's $79 offer and under QCOM's $91 request. It does seem that the odds on an acquisition have moved from 50-50 to 70-30 in AVGO's favor with a negotiated deal being about 50-50 (I wouldn't expect an announcement before Monday morning, but earlier would be wonderful)."
This was always going to happen at some point. Everyone just relax. Step away from your screens. Fundamentals are still there. I’m long

"1. The ban is a preliminary injunction (or ""PI"") issued by a Chinese court that bans iPhone models 6s to X because, in the court's opinion, these devices infringe on 2 Qualcomm patents. 2. These patents are pretty fundamental features. They involve photo editing and interfacing with apps on your phone, using a touchscreen. They are not cosmetic or ""minor,"" as some outlets have suggested. 3. The trial is already over. The PI is in place to block Apple from importing and selling these phones while the court prepares its final verdict. The evidence against Apple must be pretty compelling for the court to issue this PI. 4. Because it is a preliminary injunction, not a final verdict, it cannot be appealed. Anyone who tells you that this PI/ban is being appealed ""through the courts"" is making an inaccurate statement. 5. The PI (ban) makes no mention of iOS11 or iOS12. Stories mentioning that the PI is limited to iOS11 phones are incorrect. Per the PI, iOS11 and iOS12 are immaterial. The ban focuses on specific iPhone models, irreverent of specific iOS versions. 6. The claim that iOS12 provides a fix doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Evidence has already surfaced that iPhones shipping with iOS12.0.1 (in China) still have the features at the heart of the ban. 7. IF a future version of iOS12 does indeed provide a way around the patent infringement issues that triggered the PI, (if), Apple will still have to prove it to the court *before* the updated phones can be deemed exempt from the PI. 8. The PI (iPhone ban) is in currently effect. A separate (but similar) complaint has been filed by Qualcomm against Apple this week, asserting that the same instances of patent infringement are evident in the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. 9. There is more to this ban, but those are the highlights. Apple evidently got caught using Qualcomm's IP without permission, and a Chinese court has issued a PI to block the sale of some iphones. That's it. More cases of this type are ongoing in China, Germany, and in the US."
"Largest position. Sold some dividend plays to pile on here. 17% of my portfolio, most of any stock since I had loaded the boat with APPL a year ago. This is THE tech company to own, GARPY indeed."

"After 21years, qcom's pps has finally cleared its 1999 peak. its pps has come up slowly from 2011-2012. It has lagged the general US stock markets."
QCOM is the only bargain left in the space. Under valued by about 25%. What other semi stock can say that? None.
Because someone else is going to make 5g chips
I seriously doubt QCOM would be installing a VP in Taiwan with sole responsibility to secure even more capacity if they were about to lose their modem business from AAPL.
"As I was saying with the potential dividend increase (well its here and now if you buy at these prices you will be getting over 2% yield on your investment) plus the incredible opportunity for double digit growth in the next 3-5 years, you basically are guaranteed to get double digit returns. Reinvest your dividend and make even more money. This is how you get rich. Not speculating on overpriced companies that sell at triple digit PEs."
Any reason why QUALCOMM is up by 3%? Any positive news published?

"I bought 65 Call Contracts over a 3 day period starting a week ago. My two expiration dates are 3rd week July and 3rd week October. If QCOM goes to $100 before the 2nd week of July, I will be a very happy man. The last time I bet this big on options was in 2014 with a small company that only sold fracking sand. I watched that stock go from $22 - $65 in about 13 months. I made enough money on that one to buy a house near the beach! If you really believe QCOM will go up quickly, why are you not buying some option contracts?"
"Tomorrow should be a big day, Lots of shorts have to cover."
"Read the Bret Kenwell, Investor Place, article linked on Yahoo Finance QCOM page. It says almost exactly what I have been saying including the 68 breakout price I mentioned earlier and the downside risk."

Now I've got to figure out how to get this boy in the boat! 
when the markets are up 300 points its a sell day. Thats what my wife tell me.
I bought at 71. Should I be worried??
"We estimate a damages award totaling $1.6 Bn in favor of PRKR in the QCOM case and net accrual to shareholders at $927 Mn ($7.17/share). Our model suggests 1.75Bn infringing units and average damages per unit of $1.44, implying total damages of ~$2.5Bn. Discounting this number by 66% (probability of win per historical data by PwC) results in a damages award of $1.6Bn. Adjusting for legal and other fees, we estimate the net accrual to shareholders at $927Mn, accounting for full dilution expectations and a 30% settlement rate (industry average), implying that the expected per share accrual to investors is $7.17/share (~14x PRKR’s current market price)"
They are taking out all the panic sellers and stop losses. It will close at close to 67 or 67+.

QCOM price target raised to 145 at Mizuho.
Listened to some financial guy on Bloomberg radio after the closing bell today. Thye asked him what he liked and eventually got around to saying Qcom. Said they had been tarnished as of recently but they still expected the stock to perform well and THEY were watching it heavily.
"Very important point from today call: There is still $7.2 B remaining in share repurchases of the $30 billion authorization. In addition, ""As of today, January 30, the ASRs are approaching 40% completion and the average repurchase price to date is approximately $61"". That mean Q still has $7.8 B plus $9.6 B cash for share repurchases. That's a lot of cash."
"Good old Karma, I guess Apple Charging 30% for app tax wasn't enough... and Not paying QCOM for the fee wasn't enough..."

"Kingspellchecker, so here’s the question. So far we have $2.17 and $1.90 for this year. The midpoint is for $1.65 for this quarter but I know it’s going to be much higher, likely $2. They should finish this year at say $8.40 next year, they should do 25% minimum above this so let’s just go with $10.50. I suspect by say August/September, people (the market) will sniff this out and Qualcomm by years end should be $195, even with a  forward PE of 18.5X. Just my assumption, although new analyst numbers won’t support this when they revise their numbers just yet, eventually they will. With respect to doing 25% growth next year, the analysts will be behind the curve but the market won’t. The analysts will probably have them doing $9.75 after the report in October, idiots"
"Either way no problem. I'm very long and with all it has going for it, it will grow over time. If it dips a lot, great I'll buy even more."
QCOM has just started inching up from yesterday and the trend is your best friend. I bought some yesterday by the close.
Lol guys. Imagine if we don’t turn red even from today. That will be the most epic run ever. But I can only dream lol
Not going anywhere. I don't see any reason it to be over 140.

"Second part...Carl Shapiro, a professor of economics at the University of California in Berkeley, took the stand Tuesday to analyze the impact of the no license, no chips policy and Qualcomm's royalty rates on handset makers, chip rivals and consumers. He concluded that Qualcomm had monopoly power over CDMA modem chips and over premium LTE modem chips through 2016.""It's my view they harmed competition in those two markets,"" he said. ...Qualcomm should be commended for its technological achievements,"" Shapiro added. ""But...what's really important is that companies who aren't quite as good or who don't have the scale are not impeded from trying to catch and threaten and challenge the leader.""He testified that Qualcomm is using its market power and its monopoly power over chips to extract an ""unusually high amount"" for royalties for patents. That raises the cost for rivals, weakens them as competitors and fortifies Qualcomm's monopoly power, Shapiro said. Losing access to Qualcomm's modems would impose costs on handset makers, including not being able to supply to consumers. ""That's a very heavy hammer that Qualcomm is bringing down, at least as a threat, in those negotiations,"" Shapiro said. Michael J. Lasinski, CEO of IP consulting firm 284 Partners, on Monday testified that Qualcomm's licensing fees are ""far too high to be consistent with their FRAND operations."" Standard essential patents must be licensed in a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory manner. An Ericsson licensing executive, Christina Petersson, said in video testimony that a fair royalty rate for multimode LTE should be 6 percent to 8 percent per device. Lasinski said he determined it should be 6 percent because there's a lot more going into a phone than when Ericsson came up with its rate.Qualcomm's rates tend to be higher than that amount. Apple wanted to pay $1.50 per device in royalties to Qualcomm, based on a 5 percent fee for the cost of each $30 modem connecting iPhones to mobile networks. Instead, it ended up paying $7.50 per phone, an amount Qualcomm later wanted to raise, Apple's Williams testified. Qualcomm has argued that its broad patent portfolio and innovations justify its fees. CEO Mollenkopf, who took the stand Friday, defended the company's licensing practices, saying the way his company sells chips to smartphone makers is best for everybody involved."

"Chip shortage is due to increased demand because of all the EV manufacturing and the demand for technology due to working from home and schooling online. The only reason this stock would trend down is because they’re spending money expanding to increase manufacturing. This is a monopoly and 5g patent leader in that sector. Chip shortage isn’t bad news for this company. It’s great news, means increased demand which means expected earnings will be exceeded. I’m so bullish I’ve decided to maximize leverage, let’s get this thing back to 165"
good luck to Cristiano..he was the man behind Steve for qcoms succesz
"At least I understand now, why Apple did not appeal the San Diego Court decision: Apple is arguing that Q was fully compensated with the 31 m$ and ITC should not speak out import ban. Strange...ITC can’t speak out financial compensation, only a court can do. Import ban can’t be spoken out by a court, only by ITC. Sounds helpless...."
"Still long QCOM after 20* years, thru all the highs (Ericcson, Nokia court decisions) and lows (Mirasol, Loral sat project). Gotta have faith...and look long term. Dividend keeps me happy for the time-being. NXP, 5G should be blockbuster as long as they protect all their IP. Staying long!"
"At the mid point, QCT EBT is set to jump to $672 million, up from only $468 million in the December quarter. Investors should expect QCT margins to advance even further with the addition of Apple 5G revenues in the next few quarters.The key in late 2020 is matching the higher QCT revenues with the higher QTL revenues and those margins in the mid-70% range. Any Huawei royalty payments remain a bonus that will push EPS above $7. On top of this, the 5G market should ultimately lead to a growth rate in device shipments by next year.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that the stock is cheap below $90 when Qualcomm still remains on a path toward a $7+ EPS. Even at just a 15 P/E multiple, the stock would reach $105. The path to a higher EPS remains in sight once all of the royalty payments are collected and 5G phones become the norm in CY21 and beyond."
QCOM chips & dip makes for a great snack today!
"It's not hard to see a huwaei settlement, which one analyst suggested could result in .50-.75 in additional eps. That's another 7.50 increase per share. PLUS, if the FTC drops its suit or the judge sufficiently dilutes any punishment, that's prob worth another buck or two. I mean, it was easy to get to 90-100 WITHOUT these add-ons. It seems unreasonable making these projections because of where we came from (57), but everything most of us are saying around justiification for incremental price improvement are rooted in facts or quite reasonable assumptions/projections. I can't see it below 90 in another month and likely, much higher in 2-3 mos, esp if this earnings report has some morsels no one yet has forecast."
$300 by second quarter
What is the matter with holders of this stock selling???? It has everything going for it including low PE!

God covered?
Don’t know why she’s lagging unless it’s option action but if Intel news doesn’t give it a lift tomorrow I would be surprised as the SMH should fly.
"I didn't know 5G was going to stop growing in 2022. Some soothsayers see this, others see 50% CAGR for 8 years. IoT imaginary technology?"
Does anyone have a realistic idea when this judge might issue a stay order?
"What about QCOM to acquire NOK when it is dirt cheap now. Will become a complete turnkey US 5G solution provider. Besides QCOM used to have a network division. Currently, there is no major US network vendor such that the acquisition would be an easy approval from trump and a lucrative future business addition for US network market necessary for AI Smart technologies and IoT advancement."
So QCOM is going to sell 3 times as many 5G phones at a min of 1.5x revenue per phone (excluding premium for mm wave) and (per the analysts) only make .10 $/share more in Q1 22 vs 21? GTFOH.
144 is way way overpriced.
"At this point, it should be pretty clear to all that Apple's hate for Qualcomm steps from the fact that Qualcomm enables Apple's Android competitors and not because of the cost of Qualcomm's IPR. True, Qualcomm does charge a % of the cost of the phone but caps the phone cost @ $400. If Apple wants to lower the royalty payable to Qualcomm, they can reduce the phones price."
Still way overpriced.
This is the biggest mobile phone chip maker in the world. We are on the cusp of the biggest cellphone refresh cycle we have seen in our lifetime. Good luck all longs
"QCOM drops today, because the street doesn't think QCOM was receptive to the offer. Yet NXPI dropped a bit yesterday, because QCOM met with Uncle Hock. I think that price action clearly illustrates what NXPI is worth without QCOM, and what QCOM is worth without AVGO and Uncle Hock.The open interest in QCOM calls for February, March, and April expiration is extremely heavy. I feel that's indicative that hedge funds and institutional investors are bullish on this deal.I guess we'll see when it's announced, but this volatility is testing my nerves in the meantime."
FTC FILED APPEAL 
"I think Apple should settle already. They don't really have a good 5G solution. I think a decision against QCOM is already priced in. If QCOM wins, it will be up strongly. If they lose they can still stand alone as they have for 2-3 years and the stock may go down to $50-52. I'm long Apple and QCOM."
Don’t read anything into this weeks action. Options expiration so lots of positions bring settled in both directions. News caught everyone off guard this month so market makers trying to minimize damage for suits.
"if you are looking for the next nflx, goog, fb, amzn, then you are in the right message board."
"Back in July QCOM announced they had invested 97 Million for a 0.15% in India's Reliance Jio, between then and now, they indicated in a October PR the following plans for their partnership. Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and Reliance Jio Platforms (Jio) along with its wholly owned subsidiary Radisys Corporation today announced their expanded efforts to develop open and interoperable interface compliant architecture based 5G solutions with a virtualized RAN. This work is intended to fast track the development and roll out of indigenous 5G network infrastructure and services in India.Now todays news from ET is that India's telecom sector is expected to see some major developments in 2021 which will fuel the growth for all telecom operators such as spectrum auction, likely launch of 5G services, Open RAN adoption, among others. This hopefully could be the signal indicating a major rollout of ground systems that I hope might be be awarded to QCOM ((((or at the very least a significant piece of the equipment orders)))) in a market that could eventually rival China's in size. Adding to my belief / hope is that the border tensions between India and China and China's ongoing spying has led to the barring of certain Chinese companies like Huawei and almost all Chinese created APPS that might allow access to data in India .Todays news as written below is also indicating the 2nd half of 2021 for initial 5G launch which I believe may be the next major escalation in sales. Recently at the India Mobile Congress 2020 (IMC 2020), Reliance Jio chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said Jio would take the lead in launching 5G in India in 2H21 using in-house 5G hardware. He also added that Jio would take the lead in pioneering the 5G revolution in India.All in all this investment in JIO was a smart move and may eventually open up the entire India market to QCOM for 5G ground equipment.Hope I am right... GLTA"

"Feb 28, 2019, 09:10pmNew iPhone Leak Reveals Apple's 5G Design Problems￼Gordon KellySenior ContributorConsumer TechApple’s response to angry critics has been impressive. Plans for a folding iPhone and Face ID-inspired display miraculously surfaced this week buy some goodwill. But a much bigger obstacle suddenly lies.The ever-excellent MacRumors has attained a new research note from financial giant Barclays which reveals iPhones will not only miss out on 5G in 2019, but all 2020 models may be restricted to 4G as well.Barclays explains that the modem design for 2020 iPhones ""needs to be set now,"" and Intel’s race to ship its first 5G smartphone modem in late 2019 ""does not work with Apple's timeline.""Compounding this is Apple’s legal fight with Qualcomm. The chip giant is the obvious alternative and its 5G modems are commercially ready. Unfortunately, the two companies are engaged in a ferocious legal battle and Barclays states that time “seems to be running out"" for Apple to patch up differences with Qualcomm to plug its Intel-shaped gap.It also seems Apple has exhausted all alternative avenues.Apple testified that it approached Samsung and MediaTek as potential suppliers, but doubts have emerged that they can “meet Apple's production, performance, and cost demands.” Apple has even started working on its own modems, but they are years away from commercial release.The good news is Apple should get away with it this year. While 5G phones and 5G networks will both launch this year, availability will be limited. But this changes in 2020 and releasing premium iPhones without 5G for the October 2020 to October 2021 lifecycle is marketing suicide.When Apple and Qualcomm kicked off their legal battle in 2017, it was widely assumed Apple had the upper hand. But it appears the technological tide is turning quickly. Recent Qualcomm victories infuriated Apple and today’s news will do nothing to improve the company’s mood..."

"@mad https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17479480/supreme-court-apple-vs-pepper-antitrust-lawsuit-standing-explainer It’s misunderstood why Apple has court case due to monopolistic behaviour: the reason for Apples monopolistic status is not the market share of IPhones, it’s the usage of Apps, where App Developers are forced to use IOS and pay a high price for using IOS. Apple might be forced to make the IOS environment available to other smartphone manufacturers. If that happens, Apples ecosystem is done. It’s an irony: Apple will use the same arguments to defend their business model, like Q is using arguments to protect their business model. No license no chips ? No IOS no Apps !"
"Excellent interview article with Steve Mollenkopf out earlier today by the WSJ, I'm just posting the one point that I'm sure will put a smile on everyone's face.WSJ: What are you most excited about technology-wise?Mr. Mollenkopf: Subsequent releases of the 5G standard are positioned for use outside of cellular networks. I’m really excited about them transforming industries. The next big industrial companies are going to be the ones that figure out digitization. AND THIS IS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MARKET CAP. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE KEY TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES THAT.BUCKLE UP FOLKS!!!"
How much in revenue will qcom generate with the new server chips and 5g? $85 is still seem low.
We should get some action on the upside tomorrow as people pile in for the dividend. Looking at the next earnings report I just can't see how we are not at least 160 by end of the year. But the major returns will come in a couple of years as this stock at least doubles from here by 2022. It is still unloved unlike AVGO and NVDA for example.
"March 23 is fast approaching, I will vote for change"
16k profit today
"Mark it on your calendar, 12/06/2017. The day that QCOM reach $77/share"
"Generally speaking their revenue breakdown and margin profile is not easy to understand or is not transparent for a number of different reasons. This can lead to confusion among investors and analysts and a resulting discount in what they are willing to pay. However, it is quite clear the business is hitting on all cylinders and the look through to the future is compelling for long term investors. I simply recommend reading the earnings transcript from the most recent quarter."
Just listened to Goldman Sachs Q&A....Two takeaways..1) Short term capacity constraint is due to incremental demand over and above original forecast created from Huawei exit. Original forecasted demand is NOT under capacity constraint.2). 2020 5G phones were 125 million units. 2021 phones are forecasted to be 500 million units ALL with at least a 1.5 step up in revenue per unit to QCOM.
"I would be surprised if they don’t settle before or during the court proceedings because the FTC in my opinion has a weaker case (indicated by one of their commissioners when they filed the suit), 2nd judges do not like to be reversed through appeal, it could affect their future and the confident in their future decisions. Usually judges encourage parties to settle to save them making decisions. In addition, how awkward for the US administration to sue and win to damage the US technology’s “National Champion” ??"
What would happen if tomorrow meeting goes well in favor of accepting the offer and what if not?
"Sorry for previous post, didn’t read it careful enough..."
5G industry is accelerating in 2021. QCOM says
CNBC roundtable said buy the weakness; interestingly analyst mentioned merging with Intel; however knowing Qualcomm they will never sell; besides Q market cap is not much lower than INTC. Still an interesting thought.
"Want another Apple patent winner? QTRH has recently won $145MM in court from Apple and they are dragging that out like they did Qualcomm. QTRH holds 3G, 4G and 5G patents and already have license agreements with companies such as NVDA, Samsung, Amazon, Cisco, TSMC and Ericsson. Check them out."
is anyone really shocked by FTC? It's time for TRUMP to step in and straighten this out. an accepted business practice with agreements in place cannot be over run by some incompetent judge who knows nothing about the industry. qcom has a right to not only survive but to profit from many of its innovations and should be protected by patents. this actually SHOCKS THE CONSCIENCE!!!
"This is a very low self esteem stock. Especially against its peers in the 5G semi chip space. The so called 5G king is by far and away the worst performer out of them all. Why? It’s simple, people think back to what a piece of  this was from 2008-2019 and love to sell it down on any news not to their liking and then incrementally buy but always lags it’s peers. Market doesn’t like this company. People here will say “it’s doubled off it’s bottom since last March”, however, it’s down 18% off it’s 52 week high while peers in the same exact space are down oh, 3-10%. Any questions?"
"Hmmmm. $16B for 178M shares, simple math is $90. Wish I understood more about how this works."

The loss in Germany today is about one patent dispute out of 6 infringement complains against Apple. Five more to go at the same court. If Q hit one of them should be sufficient !

"wait til future upward guidance, announcement of new contracts., share buybacks, and more importantly dividend increase...."
Getting ready for a bounce back up. Technical 76% bullish at foxchart. Long over 68.90.
Can it stay green?????
"The answer to what happens if QCOM has a reduction in orders from any given handset maker is clearly stated in the last conference call transcripts…immediate switch in capacity usage from low margin modem chips to high margin integrated Snapdragon…“What we’re seeing there is really since we saw supply constraints and which we continue to see across a broad set of businesses, we were able to take action to optimize our product mix, both across tiers and then also when we had reductions in orders by a large OEM – handset OEM, we were able to redirect that capacity to integrated Snapdragon products with strong margin profile. So it’s really a combination of those things. So while we remain in supply constraint, we’ve been taking actions to manage to optimize the mix within the constraints we have.”"
"AVGO=APPLE, QCOM will remain independent, Win disagreement over royalty rates, but will reduce Royalty rate marginally as settlement, and will be successful in acquisition. All opsticals have been orchestrated by our friends at Apple. They need to break down QCOM to rule the world. Apple needs to understand that their agenda is transparent, and good for only themselves, no one else. The US government sees this as well. All the noise will turn quite, then very large positions will be placed with Qualcomm. They will then get back to the business of innovating for the industry for Google, Apple, LG, Samsung, Hauwai, etc. I think the US governments got their back. QCOM is a true US technology Gem. Broadcom ...come on..are you kidding me."
Why do so many (investors?) on this board think stocks only go up??????? Day Traders?

"Also Qcom will easily beat 2019 guidance as It already signed with 30 companies to provide 5g chips. I dont see much downside, Apple is already not paying Qcom a dime. So any deal will be better than nothing.Also in the future there will be no WiFi, no need for it, everybody will just be connected to 5g at all times."
"These brokers - are they thinking ahead to 5G for IoT? Don't think so. The newest downgrade mentions 'commodification of the processor', apparently Snapdragon, good luck. Only thing I don't like about the picture is the guy with the TV show says buy."
QCOM is the best way to play 5g
"All of you guys that have not done this yet, you should check out the PEG ration of QCOM compared to other stocks. I have given a few on this board but a couple I have not given, I will now, stocks that I own LMT. I love this company, I have been an investor in it for over 15 years, reinvesting the dividend. PEG ratio 2.2 Even though PE is about 16, the PEG is almost twice as big as QCOM's 1.3, pointing to the fact that QCOM has a projected much bigger growth rate. NVDA. Excellent company but why buy it at PE 118 and PEG of 3.92 when you can have again QCOM at PEG 1.3 plus a dividend to boot. Again I know this is a simplistic way of looking at two similar companies but the PEG is actually a much more accurate evaluation IMO than PE. do your own research, don't get caught in the hype. This market is overvalued but stocks like QCOM are actually undervalued when future growth is taken into account."
"Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland maintained his positive rating on Xilinx and upped his price target to 150 from 110.The 5G upgrade opportunity is ""still a monster"" that is ""far from peaking,"" Rolland said in his note to clients."
A ton of call options above 145 strike expire this Friday. My guess is Citibank is holding the other side of those trades. Let the casino get their profits and then it will be time to move onward and upward.

"I used to own QCOM, but after languishing in the mid $40s for a few years, when it jump to $80ish, I got out and never looked back. Super product - their chips are simply the best, but their management is poor, starting with the CEO on down. They have no clue on how to unlock its value to the shareholder, but the CEO and the rest of management sure likes to pay themselves terrific bonuses at the shareholder's expense. Why am I here? just to do a check-up. If management ever changes, I'll probably buy back in (at a decent price point)."

"Here’s what’s in store for Marvell Technology, Qualcomm and other semiconductor companies this yearHere is a snippet from the Market Watch articleQualcomm’s mobile RF front end leaps past Broadcom: Qualcomm QCOM, -0.81% may be known for its modem business and has seen a great run since the company put to bed major litigation with Apple and the Federal Trade Commission over the past year, but the company is diversifying, and one of the big bets that it has made has been on the complexity of fulfilling the demand for mobile RF front end technology as 5G comes good. In its final quarter of its 2020 fiscal year, Qualcomm’s RFFE business grew to $2.36 billion from $1.48 billion. This is thanks to the company developing technical competencies to support 5G, whereas competitors Broadcom AVGO, -0.62%, Skyworks SWKS, +1.40% and Qorvo QRVO, +1.62% have all struggled. The company seeks to capture 20% of this market by 2022 and is on pace to achieve the goal.Qualcomm will also benefit significantly from the rapid growth of 5G in 2021; it rolled out its new 4-series Snapdragon mobile platform this week, making feature-rich 5G devices possible in the low-end smartphone tiers. This should significantly add to incremental results for Qualcomm as it is still early days for 5G. All of this coupled with the announcement Tuesday of the appointment of long-time Qualcomm executive Cristiano Amon to succeed Steve Mollenkopf at the helm of the company sets up 2021 to be a promising year for Qualcomm."

Why aren't we following the Nasdaq going up :(
"Think the current court case in San Diego in not interpreted correctly in the media: first it is interesting to see that Q has engaged a top notch lawyer -Kathleen Sullivan- in this case. Second: if the jury determines any price for the patents concerned (3 patents to be discussed), it will have impact on the FTC case and the Apple trial in April. During the FTC trial Apple was saying that 1.50 USD would be a fair and reasonable price for all SEP and non SEP licenses, whilst Q wants to charge 7.50 USD (applying the cap if 400 USD per device). If the San Diego Jury determines 1.58 USD (Q position in the court) or 1 USD or 0.5 USD or 0.1 USD for the 3 patents concerned, how can the whole portfolio of patents (> 100.000 patents) be worth 1.50 USD ? I think any amount determined by the Jury in San Diego will make it very difficult for the FTC case ( one major accusation of the FTC was that Q prices are not Fair and Reasonable in context with FRAND). Next week will be decision of the Jury...I hope it will be game, set and match for Qualcomm. The media reports that we talk ,only’ some multiple of 10 m USD...I think it’s completely irrelevant."

"Qualcomm Snapdragon 875, Next-Gen Modem Based on 5nm Node Reportedly Go Into Production at TSMC FacilityBy Omar Sohail / 30 mins agoAccording to new reports, TSMC has officially entered the production stage for 5nm chips. Depending on what its clientele desires, there are reports of three 5nm nodes; the regular 5nm, 5nm+, and then you have the enhanced 5nm manufacturing process. There’s no confirmation which process Qualcomm has opted for, but if reports are true, the Snapdragon 875 should be available soon along with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X60 5G modem, which is the first baseband chip to be made on the 5nm architecture.The Timeline Also Suggests TSMC Would Have Commenced Production of Apple’s 5nm A14 Bionic ChipsThe production phase at the Nanke 18 factory has been increased by 10 percent to nearly 60,000 units in a single month, according to the text published at MyDrivers. Qualcomm is reportedly investing between 6,000-10,000 5nm wafers per month, most likely because it wants to deliver both the Snapdragon 875 and Snapdragon X60 on time. According to a previous report, all iPhone 12 models would feature a Snapdragon X60 5G baseband chip instead of the Snapdragon X55 one rumored some time back.Also, a previous Snapdragon 875 specs leak pointed towards an integrated 5G modem, which is the complete opposite business practice that Qualcomm employed with its Snapdragon 865. Looking at all these previous reports provides weight to the rumors that the new iPhone models will be rocking the newest Snapdragon X60 5G modem, but we’ll still advise our readers to treat this information with a pinch of salt.According to estimates, the Snapdragon 875 could be delivered to Qualcomm around September, with the chipset manufacturer’s executives expected to make an appearance in December 2020 at the Snapdragon Summit to showcase what the new silicon can achieve. It’s very unlikely that any smartphone this year will tout a Snapdragon 875, not while there’s a huge change that the Snapdragon 865 Plus launch is right around the corner, thanks to a wave of leaks.The Snapdragon 865 Plus is tipped to have higher CPU and GPU clock speeds than the regular Snapdragon 865, which only means that the Snapdragon 875 unveiling will take place in December later this year. Like always, we’ll provide you with timely updates regarding Qualcomm’s plans, so stay tuned."

"Recommend everyone to watch or read the Bernstein Analyst (Stacy Rasgon) discussion with Qualcomm President (Christiano Amon). Good insights and information.

Qualcomm is going >180 in 2 days.
"The most important thing from this Bloomberg panic piece is this.Srouji (Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies ) did NOT say when the cellular modem would be ready to ship in products, but a 2019 patent agreement between Apple and Qualcomm INCLUDES A SIX-YEAR LICENSING PACT. Qualcomm charges license fees to phone makers based on wireless patents it owns, regardless of whether they use its chips or not."
Why it’s dropping?
82 appears to be the new resistance of the day. Nice little breakout today nonetheless despite the market
"Here are some facts:1) QCOM knew it was going to lose the vote and had to have the shareholder meeting postponed to avoid losing Board control2) QCOM knows the $79 and $82 previously offered were fair as evidenced by the CEO selling about 20% of his holdings for about $66 per share on 12/18/17 (he was awarded the shares at zero cash outlay per the Form 4 filing with the SEC)3) QCOM hasn't been buying shares nor have any of the management or Board members over the last 4 months, added evidence they don't believe their statements about value (I didn't look to see when they last made an investment but they own much less than 1% of outstanding shares. In other words, they are financially incented to keep their jobs.)4) Broadcom was subject to a CFIUS review in their recent acquisition of Brocade and passed5) the suspicion that Broadcom is a foreign agent for China seems a little ridiculous given that the CEO is a U.S. citizen, the Directors are primarily Americans and the shareholders are 75% institutions most of which also own QCOM shares6) Broadcom will be a U.S. based entity on or before May 6th which would make the CFIUS review meaningless7) it doesn't look like the NXPI deal is going to get the 70% support it needs given the view by the NXPI shareholders that more money is coming because QCOM needs to overpay to save themselves from BroadcomQCOM is thwarting the will of its owners. It might work for a 30 day delay but it won't work in the longer term, it will only make the shareholders seek out a management team and Board it can trust to maximize value."

"What will be interesting is to see the institutional ownership #s in a couple weeks for Q1. Guessing they added... which was the whole point of this Q1 ""consolidation"" nonsense."
Broadcom will need to make an offer shareholders can't refuse before nxp acquisition or risk losing Qualcomm altogether as the price will be too high after the acquisition.
"I had this experience about 5 years ago. Here's how it went down.Pfizer made a great money offer to acquire Astra Zeneca .Astra pulled out every excuse known to humans why this was a terrible deal,Astra said there were so many new drugs in the pipeline that shareholders would be richly rewarded in 2 to 3 years. When that fell on deaf ears, you guessed it.........Astra ran to the Government complaining that British Law was being violated.Anyway Pfizer had enough so now 5 years later Astra stock price is lower than it was before Pfizer made their offer. My problem was that I stuck with Astra. This time I sold Qualcomm today with a $10,000 profit. I had a $17,000 profit until last week."
Qualcomm stated Apple suppliers owed it $7 billion as of October 2018 even if the settlement halved the royalty amount Qualcomm should have billions in cash coming in soon.
"Down because they can't sell chips to Huawei, but it is also possible that Huawei would have eventually stolen their technology. Right now, Huawei phone buyers may have to switch phone brands to get 5G, and that could help QCOM. Too close to 5G roll-out to speculate on selling now--I say hang in there for $102."
"It’s just 2 weeks since the big drop. Be ready for another 10 days consolidation at least, the chart says."
"Not giving in to any BS scare tactics by the media and those 2 political loons dragging out problems longer than they should be. QCOM will be sitting in the iron throne of 5G, will there be blood? Yes, but not QCOM's"
Must have been a bad earnings report. Market is never wrong. Fire mgmt!
"I saw the 132.x 5 min ago, is that right?"
"The Federal Trade Commision did not like the way QCOM set up its business model. If everything was honky dory, QCOM would not be under fire. They gap it up in the AM and sell into it, Institutions are unloading there shares. I think they will take it back down to the previous box pattern, stage a head fake rally and break it back down to new lows. The reason is, QCOM is now worse then they were before the Apple deal. The appeal is the bag which contains uncertainty. It just prolongs the inevitable."
"Broadcom has got no tech. What it has are backers like Apple. But the clock is winding down. The sooner 5G becomes mainstream, the more desperate Broadcom and APPLE will be"
"JPMorgan, Overweight, PT Raised From $88 to $96""Near-Term Earnings Challenges from Smartphone Industry Weakness Unlikely to Materially Change 5G Bull Case,"" analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a note out Thursday morning. For the near-term, ""the softer than expected end-market conditions are unlikely to impact the positive investor sentiment relative to Qualcomm's leadership in the imminent transition to 5G for the smartphone market,"" he added. He lowered his 2019 EPS earnings per share estimate to $3.86 from $4.56, and reduced 2020 EPS estimates to $5.95 from $6.90. However, Chatterjee also raised his price target on Qualcomm due to ""a premium valuation associated with 5G leadership,"" with his new 2021 EPS multiple going from 12 to 16."

"5G Technology May Be in Use by 2021Qualcomm also made some big splashes at CES this year, where Ford and Qualcomm announced a partnership to study cellular V2X technology. That may have been a significant victory in the push to promote cellular. As recently as April 2017, Ford was telling federal regulators that it agreed that “DSRC is the only proven communication technology currently available that meets latency and availability requirements” for these systems. Only eight months later, Don Butler, Ford’s executive director of connected vehicles, said that technologies including 5G and cellular V2X are “fundamental to support our vision for connected cars.”Qualcomm’s cellular V2X chips are expected to be deployed commercially next year, and Duggal says they could be underpinned by 5G technology to be commercially deployed by 2021. In vehicles, Duggal says, 5G will give these connected systems longer range, better reliability, and lower latency than either DSRC or the LTE-based systems in today’s cellular V2X chips. Should its products underpin the arrival of 5G in automotive uses, Qualcomm’s role in the industry will only expand. A 2017 report from consulting firm IHS Markit suggests that 5G connectivity may enable $2.4 trillion in economic output across the automotive sector by 2035"
My only regret is that I didn't buy more. This is an underrated tech titan. Am I a contrarian here? I prefer if this thing stays down as much as possible so I can load up more!!!
"Guys, can someone explain how the following would normally work out? Company A (QCOM), selling for $55 per share at a $80 billion capitalization, acquires company B (NXPI), selling for $110 per share at a $40 billion capitalization (numbers are imprecise). Why would the stock go up or down apart from its intrinsic growth value? Shouldn't the combined company have a cap of $120 billion with a share price of around4 $55? Won't every share of NXPI convert to 2 shares of QCOM?"

Good day for the Q on Friday
"Few days left until ITC decision. In a first decision , Judge Pender (Administrative Law Judge for ITC) found a patent infringement but ruled out, that an import ban is against public interest. It was discussed, as an import ban was not often overruling an infringement. The nomination of Judge Pender is discussed to be in line with law or not (cannot link it but google calabresi pender itc, you will find details). Many things have happened, last Friday gave 3 court decisions (Rebate, Japan, San Diego). What could be decided on 26th ? A) The first decision is confirmed. Personally I don’t believe, because in San Diego another 3 patents have been found to be infringed by Apple. ITC would start to loose face, when they stretch the importance of public interest even more and devaluate patents at the same time. I give it a 30% likelihood. If it happens, share price should go below 50 days average. B) ITC speaks out a hard import ban. Apple would be forced to settle with Q. It is questionable, if an infringement of 1 or 4 patents (including the last three from San Diego) can justify a hard ban, although historically the argument of public interest was used only a few times. If it happens, share price will significantly go above 200days average, direction 70. I give it a 40% chance, the San Diego ruling makes it much more complicated for ITC. C) ITC speaks out temporarily import ban. ITC could contribute constructively by speaking out a time-limited import ban. It should be long enough, that Apple cannot play with workarounds but short enough to make Q think about a settlement as well. I give it a 70 % likelihood. The durance of the import ban is unclear for me (1 year ?) and the mechanism to bring Q also to the table cannot be ,ordered’ by ITC. However, I believe a temporary import ban will be the result. Depending on durance, share price will go direction 50 days average or 200 days average or above. I’m thankful for constructive advice and hope it’s helpful. Unnecessary to say, that leaks/rumors/fake news or true news could change the picture. Last but not least, I find it interesting that Apple did not appeal the San Diego court decision."
"I think now is a good time for Q to reconsider a speedy NXP deal, may be after court stay!"
The Revenue and Earnings power QCOM has in front of them is much larger than most people realize. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-business-takes-internet-things-130000105.html
We are going to 15 PE?
"Apple is going to put a ""big hurt"" on QCOM's business as soon as they launch the new modem."
"Manfred, we need you to weigh in! What is the significance of this???"
Well GOLLY! 
Inevitable
Huge buy at the close.
In case people here is wondering why QCOM is down today...Reuter reports that commerce dept will announce additional restrictions on HUAWEI today...aimed at preventing huawei from buying any semi chips that were developed in US using without special license... this is nothing new since QCOM was not able to sell chips to Huawei until we get special license anyway... Qcom is lobby government to get this special license. When this happens it also could mean QCOM can sell it to Huawei with higher pricing. Huawei need QCOMs chips to effectively compete against competitions. Buying opportunity for those waiting to buy QCOM
"here's an ideal outcome as a qualcomm shareholder - nxp shareholders refuse to sell their shares at $110 and Qualcomm is free of obligation to buy, broadcom increases offer to 85 above all time high to complete the purchase. broadcom has all the right products heading into the future."
So I walked into an IPhone store just the other day. I wanted to buy an IPHONE for $350. Apple REFUSED to sell one to me. Can I sue them? Seems like they have a monopoly on Iphones. Where is the FTC?
In @ $129.05
Own QCOM since 1999
a Huawei - QUALCOM agreement is very near...the 5G ROLL out is here and it is happening...
cook blew 1B just to screw with qcom value....can't anyone see that????
Premarket is very useless - I think I hold more shares than has been traded in pre-market this morning. Hang in there longs - likely ending soon. No Supreme Court risk and we will soon find out about substrate supplies - it will be nothing but green fields ahead for QCOM in a wide and expanding market.
See you at 50
Now we know why QCOM seemed reluctant to negotiate all this time... lol
winning in the courtroom and in our hearts
I can imagine weak rebound today
"Wait for more dips, we should see 100."
"I'm so fatigued by reading and interpreting legal #$%$ that I'm going to be lazy and ask the board for some help. Does anyone know generally about the Huawei litigation? Is it potentially material, if settled? Likelihood of settlement? What is the beef? Thanks so much."
all these new contracts with the 5g rollout. they should be raising guidance
"Is a question of time when $QCOM will get approval from China In regards of $NXPI after Trump’s tweet about ZTE today. Now imagine NXP , Apple and Huawei behind us. ;-)"
QCOM board meeting to discuss PJ’s fate or PJ’s sweetened bid?
"DZSI, fresh meat in 5G. New management delivering. Great earnings. Expanding TAM. Dominant, albeit still small, player, in a couple of 5G niche markets. Well financed and well positioned to capture the coming wave in 5G. Worth a lot more than the current price IMHO."
"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a stronger-than-expected 22% rise in quarterly sales, buoyed by orders from its largest customers including Apple Inc.The world’s largest contract chipmaker saw revenue for the three months to September climb to a record NT$356.4 billion ($12.4 billion), up from NT$293 billion a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on monthly sales data disclosed by TSMC. The average forecast of analysts was for revenue of NT$337.2 billion."

Welcome to the NIO Family guys! $NIO $QCOM
"It’s just one company AAPL going away, there are hundreds of companies still with QCOM and going to be with it in the long run because they don’t have a in-house modem department. I am going long. Good Luck."
Fun fact. ioT revenue now approx 40% of AMD’s total revenue and gaining.
Qua debut its new chip designed for wireless headphone with a similar connection function as Apple does in android phones. Xiaomi will be the first one to use this chip to release products in this Sumer.
CNBC Half time Report: Qualcomm is cheap and has a PEG under 1 which is crazy - Jim Lebenthal
"The incredible part of QCOM that investors (at least retail investors) typically do not see is that 5G will be much larger in industry applications than phones in the coming years. There are things happening, even today, of partnerships offering private wireless 5G solutions designed for enterprises. 5G has ultra low latency which was the missing link for robotics, etc. QCOM is expanding in this market and I completely expect 2022 to be a boom kick off year for this revenue along with IOT. 5G is bringing a digital revolution and transformation to enterprise businesses and retail (and Defense - gov) - all outside of mobile. We haven't even talked about automotive ... but the low latency is exactly what we needed there also. QCOM is positioned to benefit greatly with their IP, chips, software and relationships. I totally believe this downtrend we have seen is setting up for a very large upward wave in this stock. Will it be in the next 3 months, 6 months or 12 months? Who knows -but its coming."
Let's face it: there is no news here. $AVGO will propose new directors and as we knew the vote for them will be in March.Just before that they will make an offer. If they would make offer now it would not change anything and we would have to wait for March vote regardless
"Does anyone believe this will empower other companies e.g. apple, or nations like Japan and So Korea, who've already settled, to reopen the issue? I'm more concerned about that than the FTC case itself, which I think will be overturned. Doesn't it make sense that other countries would infer ""well, if their own court system determined their practices are illegal, then they really must be!"""
"QCOM under $65 is an easy buy. Nothing to worry about. Even if the deal doesn't materialize, there is so much going on with QCOM lately, opening up multiple Revenue channels. The NXPI deal will be the icing on the cake!"
"Took the opportunity to buy another 400 QCOM shares, thank you, Qualcomm will be at $180 by next year"
It's truly sad a 30+ year old company that is one of the most innovative in the world and spends billions every year in R&D to stay competitive would only rank third in market cap versus made up digital currencies that are truly ponzi schemes. Bernie Madoff does indeed have the last laugh on this one.
"No, the current QCOM Deutsche tender offer of $67.5 will expired midnight today. It is likely under-subscribed so QCOM will create a new one at $75 that expire by end of Sept. That will push stock up to around $74 around the board meeting, so they can keep their jobs and we are happy too ;)"
"I believe QCOM will be range bound to 85 to 95 until announcement from 9th circuit FTC judgement. Its really taking longer than expected, i am hoping for favorable results ... we should then be trading around $125 and heading toward 150 by year end. Anyone heard anything? Its really taking long time considering this case should never gone to trial in the first place."
Check Point Research found bug in QUALCOMM chips. 30% of all phones in the world are vulnerable.

"from wsj ....San Diego-based Qualcomm “has asserted its economic muscle with vigor, imagination, devotion, and ingenuity. It has also acted with sharp elbows—as businesses often do,” Judge Consuelo Callahan wrote for a three-judge panel.Despite what naysayers say, qcom is the Michael Jordan of telecom, let those elbows swing Mike!"
They reported $2.17 estimates were for $2.10 beat by .07 cents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Anything right / wrong with these Analysts ??If they are right, then I'd rather SELL, instead of holding , do I ?Oppenheimer: Perform rating“We see Tuesday’s settlement as a positive step, clearing legal overhangs while bringing former No.1 customer back into the fold. Impact to model remains uncertain and QCOM still faces regulatory rulings from FTC and other global regulators. We remain sidelined until model implications become clearer.”Citi: Neutral rating, $55 target“We believe the deal could be positive for Qualcomm given the restoration of licensing and chipset revenue and we estimate the deal could total an additional $7.0 billion and $1.55 EPS accretion to our C20 revenue and EPS estimates of $22.5 billion and $3.57 respectively. We expect Qualcomm’s other customers will pursue similar royalty and chipset pricing if Apple gets a good deal.”Bernstein: market perform rating, $60 target“The resolution caps a multi-year period in which Qualcomm’s stock has broadly been viewed as virtually uninvestible, and the resolution will likely go a long way toward assuaging investors who have been terrified of the potential for negative legal and regulatory outcomes.”Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Neutral rating, $71 target“We think the risk of changing the model to component-based licensing is muted now and going forward, the stock could start tradingon its own fundamentals of strong semiconductor and licensing businesses. On the negative side, the impending FTC decision adds some risk to Qualcomm and the stock’s 28% positive move yesterday (vs SP500 +0.05%) mitigates our enthusiasm.”Morgan Stanley: Equal weight rating, $55 target“We think this settlement is a significant win for Qualcomm and results in a similar, if not better, outcome to a scenario we laid out in January, which would have been reached had Qualcomm achieved a win at the FTC … We think settlement with Apple provides Qualcomm some leverage with other handset OEMs to ensure future royalty compliance.”"
Anyone knows how big treats from mediatek to QCOM?
"Clumsy traders have pushed the long range RSI on daily and weekly as low or lower than in the middle of pandemic crash of March 2020. Remarkably stupid even for a high beta stock, not even factoring in the booming sales and demand plus zillion of other good news compared to last year.Jus buy with both hands!"
"guys like Anon and Don, should go and invest in ketchup (kfh), because they completely do not know what semiconductors are: )"
Do not short until we find out how much Apple paid And what Qcom will do with the money... imagine a $15 billion buyback or special dividends announcement.. OUCH
"Underperforming it’s peers today, I don’t get it with this stock. For the beating it’s taken, you would think it’s up 5% today or more like many others"
"picked up more at 133.50 ,nice"
"Now is the time to load up on this one. 5G star on sell. Better load up. Huawei new phone just came out. No google apps and $1,600 price tag. Apple phones will take off global at a cheaper price point and QCOM is the chip maker. Cha Ching."
"Earnings Whisper has QCOM at 1.77 share, consensus at 1.67 so beats by 6 percent"
I think faber just said incremental eps of 2 bucks. Hang a 15 multiple on that and you get an incremental change in stock price of 30 bucks. I may be too giddy here though. maybe i'm wrong. but i think it goes much higher than this 8-9 dollar pop.
You guys ready for some news....
oh I think a big buy is in order
"somebody is buying, if not us . mm,s???"
"This is QCOM's fifth day trading above the top Bollinger Band. That is incredible, since there is only a 10% chance of trading above the Bollinger Band. Ten to the fifth power is 100,000 which means there is only one chance in 100,000 that this could happen. Tomorrow it will be one in a million if it does it again. QCOM is about as close to a risk free investment as you can get. AMGN is another one."
"So the good news is yes, Apple and Qualcomm have settled their differences. The FTC lawsuit against Qualcomm is a total interference by the FTC/government to regulate. And with the potential for a huge international issue. If the FTC prevails then Qualcomm will not be fined but rather be told to allow competitors easy access to Qualcomm’s intellectual properties and the biggest winner would be China!And along with this, security issues with worldwide negative downsides. China would rule the 5g universe. Competitive issue amongst the competitors and the courts should see that companies can regulate their own differences and resolve disputes without government intervention in most cases. The FTC lawsuit should be dropped. Apple and Qualcomm have taken that step...now it’s up to the FTC. If not, everyone will be the loser. Here is a great must read article concerning this topic!Ned Ryun: The critical 5G warhttps://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ned-ryun-the-critical-5g-war"
"Nice 3% gain for the week. QCOM acting like a stodgy blue chip with hefty dividend. Likely at 150 by Father’s Day, 160 by the 4rth, and 180 by Labor Day. NICELY PLAYED QUALCOMM!"
the Japan decision explicitly states that they were not involved in monopolistic behavior....its great for qcom and the FTC decision...
QCOM should prioritize sales to all customers other than Apple. Oh… and… triple the cost of hardware shipped to Apple.
"QCOM is still in distribution mode, drop with close to 3X, 50 day MA volume. Wait in the sideline for the time being. QCOM problem is also signified the problem with foundry, semiconductor companies with its own manufacturing capacity has an edge. For that like INTC, ADI, and TXN."
What happened. After hours jumped up
If QCOM gets a government license to supply Huawei we'll see new highs.https://www.asiatimesfinancial.com/new-huawei-chairman-bends-the-knee-to-qualcomm
Might get some buzz from the Samsung unpacked event today. Many new 5G phones launching today including the Galaxy Note 20 with snapdragon 865. Onward to $120+ we go.
Anyone holding for 172 or are y’all getting ready to sell
It's overpriced so low volume today
"Also, Qualcomm never seems to have a big up day on its own, away from other semi chips except for an earnings report. You don’t see this outperforming other semi chips when they’re all up by any significant margin when it does."
"Folks my opinion next weeks earnings may mean little to nothing!! QCOM's Apple settlement changed everything going forward. Since the new ""Agreement"" there has been really no amount of time for the ""New Revenue"" to hit the bottom-line. Maybe the billions Apple agreed to pay that they owed QCOM will hit but I'm not sure at this point. Maybe someone knows the date of back payments are to be made to Qcom will help that Question?? Food for thought!Long for a Long time!!"
"I might not be the smartest guy around like some of the BRILLIANT minds on this board, so please answer this question for me.If I own a stock for 3 years and the stock hasn't given me any capital gains in that time period, and has been sued numerous times also, why should I believe that this time is different?Just a simple question."
Hey anyone using Bull spreads going into earnings? I’d love to hear some ideas from people using this strategy. Credit or debit and shots and long strike. I would appreciate any ideas. Thnx and gl all
Let's all hold our breath and hope QCOM closes at $118.
"If Broadcom offers 2000 USD per share, it is worth considering"
way oversold...
always buy a stock with a healthy dividend during market manipulation. It is your best friend. That is what we have with QCOM here.
USA ruling basically says a valid contract (one not in violation of law) is in fact valid. Nippon ruling took QCOM out of the penalty box. It's just positive to get these unknowns settled. The next patent infringement ruling will hopefully be known before Monday.
Just be glad you don't own SWKS on days like this. They were (were is keyword here) at their 52 week high - at least with QCOM we know the downside on these bad market days is limited.

"Strange to put out a PR with this language: ""We met with representatives of Broadcom for two hours earlier today, and listened carefully to what they had to say. The Qualcomm Board will promptly meet to discuss the meeting and to determine next steps.""""Listened carefully"" means it wasn't really a dialog??""Determine next steps"" means (a) there is some potential there for a deal, or (b) we need to figure out a way not too accept the offer and still look like we care about our shareholders"
"This stock price will fall until enough people have sold. Don't try to convince people to hold, convince them to sell then, when it bottom buy it for cheap."
Enjoying the enthusiasm but I'm going into earnings quite cautiously. It has been a mix bag for tech. Intel and Google missing and Apple beating. I'm skeptical for tomorrow. Hope I'm wrong.And I do miss Don.
"As ITC starts tomorrow: Apple/Intel argued at the beginning, that an import ban due to patent infringement would delay 5G development and force Intel out of modem business. Somewhen later a workaround is presented. So from ,evil monopolistic’ to ,sorry, we fix it’ within 45 days. Tells you a lot about the quality of arguments used by Apple and Intel. The judges concerned should really feel mocked. https://www.phonearena.com/news/ITC-to-rule-March-26th-on-possible-U.S.-iPhone-ban_id113823"
"The difference between Tesla and QCOM is that Tesla is being valued on future prospects one to two decades from now. QCOM is being valued on its prospects one year from now. If you were to flip that methodology, Tesla would be a $30 Billion market cap company instead of $300 billion and QCOM would be a $2 Trillion market cap company instead of $125 Billion."
"I have to say this. INTC is trying so hard to figure out why QCOM chip is better. Their AAPL customer are not happy. AAPL is cornered. Sooner or later, they will be looking for a face saving exit from this mess they under estimated otherwise they will miss the 5G window to revive their phone business."
When can we see green?

"A little historical perspective with Rod Hall. As history is the best predictor of the future. Almost exactly this time last year he downgraded QCOM and APPLE pre earnings. QCOM to 61 and Apple to 58. This downgrade came after QCOM had corrected from 90 to 70 (Feb to March)... sounding familiar? Since then - both QCOM and APPLE have more than doubled and had a banner year. Rod is ranked 3,250 on Tip Ranks and is right 50% of the time. He also said at the time that he expects iphone sales to slow by 25% going into 2021 and the Apple services segment to slow - well... iphones have had record sales and Apple services is Apple's fastest growing segment over the last year. If it is not completely obvious that Rod Hall is buying QCOM for his clients right now, then you must live on Mars."

Litigation expense savings, for next quarter, 5g standard setting. Litigation saving for entire year. 6 year contractual agreement"
Guidance is slightly above Street on both sales and earnings for next quarter.
"Apple bad news more likely is a good news to QCOM. It means that more people are buying Android phones. Apple has been ripping off its customers for years. Consumers are smarter now, especially after the battery scandal. For several years, Apple has no new innovation, it just copies the ideas from other phone companies, and keep raising price. Less and less people are willing to pay $1-1.5K to get an iPhone. It is just too ridiculous to get an iPhone for $1.5K with the inferior Intel chip which is less capable than QCOM chip. Android phones from Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus and even Huawei are more popular these days, especially in many European and Asian countries becausethey are equally capable, some cases more capable, and much cheaper. Android is more open than the iOS."
Wow! The auto business must be a gold mine for QCOM or the automakers wouldn’t be whining about it already.

"Qualcomm new PT $100 - Qualcomm upgraded to Buy from Hold at Stifel (via TheFly)""Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy upgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) to Buy and raised his price target to $100 from $57, saying today's ""surprise"" agreement with Apple (AAPL) to settle all pending litigation removes a legal overhang that persisted for the past two years. The analyst also contends that the concession made by Apple was designed to make sure that a 5G iPhone would be available in the market in 2020 and may signal that Intel's (INTC) 5G modem ""may not be production-ready"" next year. Shares of Qualcomm have extended their late session 23% spike on the news with another 5.8% gain afterhours, while Intel is trading down about 0.6%."""
MRVL and AVGO is the leader.Qualcomdey always the follower.
"Good day not to be affiliated with that very computing power / fossil fuel intensive industry known as crypto mining (i.e. NVDA, AMD). 5G super cycle will hopefully lead the next leg up in tech (QCOM, AAPL, etc)"
So it is possible that we might get more than $82?
"IOT GameChanger QCOM 315 5G modem shipping NOW!5G may soon come to robots , tractors and self-checkout lanes, among other things, thanks to a new wireless processor from Qualcomm . On Thursday the chipmaker unveiled the 315 5G IOT modem, its first chip to link internet-connected devices to superfast 5G networks. The processor will be aimed at industrial segments such as agriculture; automation and manufacturing; construction; energy; mining; public venues; and retail. A stadium owner could install the 315 5G IOT to bring better connectivity and coverage to game attendees, while a tractor manufacturer could use it to enable more-precise data collection in fields, Qualcomm said.Play VideoBeyond the 5G hype: Searching for real solutions to the coronavirus messREPLAY VIDEOTo address the needs of industrial customers, Qualcomm designed the processor to be low power -- which means the machines run cooler in hot warehouses -- and smaller than its modems for consumer devices, letting the 315 fit in the same size package as its earlier 4G processors. That should let industrial companies easily switch 4G chips for 5G modems without having to completely redesign their machines, speeding up how quickly they can deploy them. ""Power, thermal efficiency and size are ... the key elements as to why we felt that there is a need in the market for this type of part,"" Qualcomm's vice president of product management, Vieri Vanghi, said in an interview ahead of the news. ""Those are important characteristics of this chipset that make it suitable for IoT and that are meant to remove some of the friction points"" that prevent Qualcomm's mobile-focused processors from appealing to customers in the IoT sphere. IoT refers to the internet of things, or devices -- from refrigerators to cars to factory machines -- that can communicate via the internet.Experian Boost is Free, Easy, and…AdExperianDownload￼ QualcommQualcom's 315 5G IOT modem will help connect robots in factories and enable high-tech tractors in the field. The heavily hyped 5G technology runs between 10 and 100 times faster than today's typical 4G cellular connection, and it's much more responsive than 4G and Wi-Fi. 5G provides more capacity on the network, letting a greater number of devices be connected at the same time. And it's more reliable than other wireless connections. The initial hype around 5G has been all about mobile , but the technology has the ability to transform more than just phones . And Qualcomm wants to be the company providing the modems to connect everything to 5G networks. The 315 runs on the slower but more reliable type of 5G known as sub-6GHz. One version of the chip also comes with 4G connectivity for customers who aren't ready to go all-in on 5G. It's capable of downloading data at up to 1.54Gbps and uploading data at up to 330Mbps. ""Sub-6GHz is what the industry requires, for good reasons,"" Vanghi said. ""Most of the applications ... even the ones that relate to robots and control, those are not high volume data. ... Those require low latency, [but] they certainly don't require high data rates."" Right now most 5G networks in the US are something called nonstandalone. They need 4G as the anchor to make that initial handshake between a phone and network before passing the device along to a 5G connection. The next version of 5G networks, called standalone, lets a phone go straight to 5G, speeding up the connection and improving the power consumption. The 315 operates in standalone mode, which is only deployed by T-Mobile (and formerly Sprint ) in the US. The processor, because of its standalone capabilities, will arrive first in Europe and China and later expand to Japan. It's unclear if customers in the US will use the technology, Vanghi said. Qualcomm's 315 5G IOT modem will ship this week to customers and will likely appear in devices later this year and early next year."

Added to my position when it was down 10%. with high chip demand I see it as a buy and recovering quickly
"Like I said before, more QCOM downgrade is ahead of us."
I like how the 5 day chart looks

"This doesn’t fluctuate much because a large amount of people are not willing to sell their stocks, cause it’s undervalued when you compare QCOM’s PE to other companies in this industry, and with a PEG less than 1, it’s a no brainer. This is clearly either going to sit at this price, or people are going to start to jump in, but the shorts and the hedge funds can try to sway you emotionally, but hang in there!"
Apple and Qualcomm are reporting ER on the same day. That is either going to end very good or very bad. Ha ha.
"Does everyone feel qcom's board has fulfilled its responsibilities as defined below:The primary role of the Board of Directors of the Company is to enhance longterm stockholder value by (i) selecting and maintaining a succession plan forthe position of Chief Executive Officer and key members of management, (ii)establishing and reviewing the strategies and goals of the Company, and (iii)overseeing the business and affairs of the Company in light of emerging risksand opportunities."
Qualcomm will be buying their stock back heavily. Stay tuned.
I’m not selling for no good reason. There is no apparent reason for this other than manipulation to steal shares.
"Qualcomm does not own ZOOM any more, it exited already! For full list of Qcom private equity investments check:https://www.qualcommventures.com/companies/enterprise/zoom"
"QCOM seems to start realizing that an acquisition by Broadcom might be beneficial given the growing competition in 5G (+Huawei), stagnating mobile chip business, uncertainty of future success in automotive and litigations based on their license business model. In my opinion QCOM has a price in mind at which they will sell."
"Has QCOM stated any plans to be able to increase demand? Such as expanding facilities, or buying smaller business in chips to utilize their infrastructure for increasing supply? Just looking for information."
"Different recipe, same flavor"
"I thought this was already known, we all knew that Apple signed a 6 year licensing agreement with Qcom in 2019 with the understanding that they would be developing their own Modem Chips. I added to my Qcom near 100 so I am not going to add more on this dip, but If you don't have a position in Qcom, this would be a good time to start one. This is a nothing burger with extra nothing"
"Long Qualcomm! I'm not selling under $120, until then, I'm enjoying the ride and the dividends!""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" - Warren Buffett"

HAHA how many folks glad they didn't panic sell when it dipped into the mid $$60s.
Apple need Q in the next 6 years more than Q needs Apple otherwise why did Apple settle their dispute and signed a 6 years agreement ? Most of the cell phone manufacturers have signed to purchase Q's chip. Q must have the best modem chip in the market. Tremendous growth plus 3.3% dividend.
"Last time QCOM closed above 70 was October 27, 2016. Before that date, May 28,2015."

Not seeking any big announcement about Apple 5G chips...just some credit agreement from Qcom
nothing prevents this from being a 100
"Finally had a chance to go through the stay. Complete victory for Q. “The court order must have sounded like music to Qualcomm’s ears. Even they could not have written it better! Don’t be confused by the title of the court order which says “partial stay,” Qualcomm actually got all of what it requested, and then some. The tone, the language, the arguments, the selection of phrases and words, the precedence cited, the direct denunciation of the lower court’s decision, everything screams a thumping Qualcomm victory.“"
"Hopefully the management used up the rest of the buyback money. Once the FTC and the Apple trial verdicts are made public, the share price will be north of the Broadcom take over offer price."
Keep’em coming!!Analyst sees $120/share Qualcomm bull casehttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3452799
"pple should be the one to buy Qcom. 1) Apple would need the Qcom chip and the 5G in order to keep it's No 1 place in the market2) Apple won't have any anti trust or security concern, it's U.S company.3) Apple has enough cash4) Apple can use the money which they are holding against Qcom as the bargaining chip. that will benefit both.5) Apple's share price is good enough to do share exchange with the Qcom shareholders and keep the happy6) Shareholders of Qcom wouldn't need to be afraid Apple would tear Qcom apart and sell them away. The legacy of Qcom will still continue in Apple but only to create a bigger empire together.7) Qcom would not need to face any anti trust law suits which has caused them so much anymore.it would make perfect sense for the two to merge together. if that's the case, everybody should stock up shares of both Apple and Qcom now. it's gonna be multiply when the deal goes through"
APPLE phones were sold exclusively in ATT for 2 years so is it not against competition ? what was that deal then ?
"I invested during the dotcom, and housing bubble and never panic sold. QCOM is a keeper. Stay long and ignore Wall Street. Stick with companies that make money and pay dividends. The Corona panic will abate in a few months."
Cristiano during the ER said supply constraints will ease in H2 and 2022. Maybe this means something important to the other companies in this group. Group strength (share appreciation) should be good for QCOM shares.
I wasn't able to catch Amon on CNBC - can someone provide a recap? Hoping he stressed the fact they are growing in non-phone revenue! They need to stop being valued as a phone chip supplier...ughhh.
How high do you think a positive decision in the FTC case could move the stock?
"Probably the most important ER and more specifically Q&A after the ER that QCOM has had in many a year. If Mollenkopf handles himself like he did on the Squawk on the Street program after the Apple settlement was announced, then this stock will soar and I mean take off! This is a time you want to be owning this stock. Watch out for any head fakes after the ER is initially released. What QCOM did in the past quarter is all fine and dandy but where the company sees itself going forward now, with the Apple settlement behind us, is what the Fund managers wants to hear. It’s a call I can’t wait to hear. Me thinks we fly on Thursday :)) TUNE OUT AND MUTE ALL THE NOISE."

"Looks like we have another Ilon Musk type working for Intel this time. Dude came out, guns blazing, promising all kinds of ""new"" and ""exciting"" things for Intel except we know Intel has not done anything that new or exciting since 2007. I know many will say why doesn't the QCOM CEO come out and say a few exciting things to get the stock moving. He doesn't need to. QCOM doesn't need any cheerleaders, they have the technology, the patents, the engineers, the future."
"As I see it QCOM is a winner either way.If it is successful in its bid to acquire NXPI it wins,if AVGO acquires QCOM it’s shareholders also win. That being said my personal preference is QCOM buying NXPI and avoiding the merger with AVGO."

This demonstration was operated in compliance with the 2x30MHz technical specifications of CBN’s 700MHz FDD band and utilized a 5G smartphone form factor mobile test device powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon X55 5G Modem-RF System. This demonstration achieved download speeds of more than 300 Mbps and provides a foundation for further enhancing the spectral efficiency of the 700MHz band and accelerating CBN’s commercial 5G rollouts nationwide."
I will believe Apple developing its own chip when I see it! Be cheaper just to buy QCOM.
"In related news, Aletheia Capital reportedly downgraded MediaTek stock, saying in part it expects fiercer competition from Qualcomm once TSMC begins fabricating 5G chips for Qualcomm in the 4th quarter of this year, resolving its shortage, media say."
"I have been following this board for the last 9 months or so. I to am slightly annoyed by all the spam. From a stock confidence perspective I am very pleased that QCOM is allowing their results to speak for themselves. They are not reacting to stories on the periphery of their success. They are executing on a well laid out plan. We are all invited to enjoy the ride. In my opinion it is to early to develop an exit strategy as this needs to be revised as results (not rumours) are released. While the news of Apple producing their own chips is concerning, it is old news. Microsoft, the same. 5G is just getting started and those of us in the stock are highly likely to reap the rewards. No guarantees, however from my perspective QCOM has positioned themselves and their investors in an enviable position."
"im thinking the crux of the issue with appl is that qcom has created and supported the anti iphone with ANDROID. apple resents the fact the they paid and Qcom was their primary source for modems,and chips and Qcom turned around and supported android as well. they had a showdown and apple is sticking it to Qcom in spades. what's your take?"
"Here we go…….Successful Milestone Addresses “The Last Mile” Connectivity Challenge and Enhances Consumer Broadband Experiences as Data Demand GrowsSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 6, 2021-- What’s New: UScellular, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., Ericsson and Inseego today announced the companies have successfully achieved a 5G extended-range milestone over millimeter Wave (mmWave) on a commercial network. This milestone was accomplished at a distance of 7 km, the farthest 5G mmWave Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) connection in the United States, with sustained average downlink speeds of ~1 Gbps, sustained average uplink speeds of ~55 Mbps and instantaneous peak downlink speeds recorded at greater than 2 Gbps[i]. Additionally, at a distance of 1.75 km with no line of sight, the companies achieved sustained average downlink speeds of ~730 Mbps and sustained average uplink speeds of ~38 Mbps. These results were achieved in Janesville, Wis., on UScellular’s commercial network by applying Ericsson’s extended-range functionality to Ericsson commercial hardware Antenna Integrated Radio (AIR) 5322 advanced antenna system, along with an Inseego Wavemaker 5G outdoor CPE FW2010 powered by the Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access Platform gen 1 featuring Qualcomm Snapdragon X55 5G Modem-RF System and a Qualcomm QTM527 mmWave antenna module. The achievement demonstrates the impressive range and connectivity speeds 5G mmWave can provide to homes and businesses everywhere."
Will new ceo give us a surprise?
"Guess what, QCOM has a good chance to beat estimate around 7% only, but the stock keeps going up. Don't I know something what the traders thinking? All I know that AAPL will definitely use QCOM chipset this year, otherwise AAPL will lose the market share of 5G without any doubt, particularly in China."
This situation is no different that a drug company that has a patent on a unique drug and can charge high prices for it. No one is preventing other drug companies from finding alternatives to provide competition. No one is preventing other tech companies from doing research and finding alternatives to Qualcomm devices stimulating competition. Qualcomm should be fair in its licensing practices but should receive a premium. Why penalize a successful company just because others are complaining about its prices. Who's gonna determine what's fair...the judge? I don't think so.

"NXPI is a good deal for Qualcomm. The NXPI techology , Patents in IoT, compliments the Qualcomm portfolio well.

Recent downgrades from Evercore and Susquehana analysts claiming headwinds will weigh on QCOM are not helping. Price targets reduced but still higher than current shares are.
"In context with charging 30% reg. Apps, the argument of Apple is, they are the best (security...). Qualcomm’s argument to charge a high percentage for licenses is, they are the best (speed...).

"""Any attempt to trivialize or delegitimize Qualcomm’s IP and its role in the industry will have a long-lasting impact not only on the smartphone market but on the entire tech industry. If the FTC undermines companies’ ability to earn rewards for the investments, or worse, arbitrarily caps the value of their technology, it will discourage the American innovation and severely curtail the flow of capital to those innovations. Small and medium-sized companies that are the backbone of this innovation engine will be the most affected. So, in essence, this trial may (unwittingly?) amount to a war on the American innovation engine, and a negative outcome will ultimately hurt American consumers by decimating competition and choice in the marketplace; this is the antithesis of the FTC’s very existence and charter."""
"""In the mobile space, Qualcomm is the only company that has the technical aptitude to keep up with Apple when it comes to silicon and processor design. The entire Android smartphone ecosystem, which is multiple times larger than the iPhone market, depends on Qualcomm and Snapdragon to move forward performance, efficiency and features.

"FTC will not petition Supreme Court for review of Qualcomm case - TheFly""Following the Federal Trade Commission's decision not to petition the Supreme Court for review of the Qualcomm case, Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter issued this statement: ""Given the significant headwinds facing the Commission in this matter, the FTC will not petition the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in FTC v. Qualcomm. The FTC's staff did an exceptional job presenting the case, and I continue to believe that the district court's conclusion that Qualcomm violated the antitrust laws was entirely correct and that the court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise. Now more than ever, the FTC and other law enforcement agencies need to boldly enforce the antitrust laws to guard against abusive behavior by dominant firms, including in high-technology markets and those that involve intellectual property. I am particularly concerned about the potential for anticompetitive or unfair behavior in the context of standard setting and the FTC will closely monitor conduct in this arena."""
I’m buying more tommorow
"I view the 25,000 a day fine on Apple meaningful. Money is money and the more they have the more they want and their board has to insist that they do not exert any more that what is not necessary. Additionally, I see QCOM closing out the NXPI deal and Broadcom and Apple's knees will buckle. I see both Broadcom and Apple believing QCOM is no match for them. Although, a QCOM/NXPI union will change that the second it is finalized and announced, they yield from $103 billion to nearly doubling it to $210+ billion. Both Broadcom and Apple know what awaits once QCOM/NXPI deal is completed, that no matter how much money both Broadcom and Apple have in order to evolve in technology with their offerings they will have to kiss the ring of the true king of the throne QCOM/NXPI. Presently, it almost seems as if QCOM is loosing or will loose and I view them as being the victor. And once the QCOM/NXPI deal is close there will be a sling shot affect to the stock price from current levels to $180+. And this scenario could occur within a week+ and would not be totally surprise if with 2 to 3 days of the announcement depending on the day of the week. QCOM/NXPI may become the technology darling of 2018, the one company that burned Broadcom backed by Apple by its QCOM/NXPI Targaryen's Snapdragons."
"This puts the Huawei advance buying question to restTSMC Shrugs off Huawei Ban and Shows Who’s King By Tim Culpan | BloombergJuly 16, 2020 at 7:07 a.m. EDT Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. was expected to be severely hurt by a U.S. ban on producing chips designed by Huawei Technologies Co., one of its largest clients. The opposite seems true. The Taiwanese chip foundry posted earnings Thursday that far surpassed estimates, and went on to raise its revenue and spending guidance for this uniquely troubled year. Not only does Huawei make a large slice of the world’s telecommunications network equipment, it’s also a major international smartphone brand. To power a lot of that gear, it designs chips at its own HiSilicon unit that are manufactured by TSMC. But a May 15 edict from the U.S. Department of Commerce banning the use of American technology to make chips for Huawei has forced the Taiwanese company to stop taking orders from its Chinese client. Given that Huawei is the company’s second-largest customer behind Apple Inc., the move was widely expected to deliver a body blow to TSMC, especially in orders for its latest manufacturing technology. TSMC has barely flinched. The supply chain will adjust, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told investors bluntly. In other words, the broader trends toward 5G mobile networks and smartphones, coupled with high-performance computing products (such as artificial intelligence and graphics) means that if end-customers don’t buy from Huawei, they’ll find someone else. And that alternative supplier is going to turn to TSMC for chips. So far, it looks like Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB will replace Huawei in networks. In smartphones, brands from Xiaomi Corp. to Apple Inc. may benefit, while Huawei itself can ship devices using semiconductors from third-party designers like Qualcomm Inc. and MediaTek Inc. Asked how the Huawei ban would impact TSMC’s ability to fill up its multi-billion dollar factories, Chairman Mark Liu said that the company is progressing well in using any capacity left open. He’s putting his money where his mouth is. The company will now add another $1 billion for spending on new equipment in its 2020 plan, taking the budget as high as $17 billion. As if to prove the naysayers wrong, TSMC went one step further by raising its revenue forecast. In April, it expected sales would climb a “mid to high single digit percentage” this year. Now, the company reckons it will top 20% growth. It’s almost as if the Covid-19 pandemic and the Huawei ban had never happened. Companies are installing new servers, stay-at-home workers are buying computer monitors, and quarantined consumers are whiling away the hours on games consoles. What it comes down to is that in any scenario, electronics are being bought and semiconductors are running them. Inevitably, that means the world still needs TSMC.

"I'm not selling, I'm buying"
"Qcom has raised dividends on Q1 earnings 5 years in the row. Expect very big bump on dividends on earnings. Also buyback will be announced with all $7 billion it received from Apple, thats 9% of the float.... Plus increased EPS guidance from 30 new contracts signed at CES for 5g chips.Dont sell before earnings on May 1st. You will regret it."
Something strong is brewing
"To all the boards valuable contributors and even the lurkers that are shareholders, I'm wishing you all the merriest of Christmas's and a VERY happy, healthy and profitable NEW Year!!!We are now only 4 trading days away from the end of the year, which is also the end of the quarter :-) and the beginning of the countdown to 2/3/21.I'm hoping that Santa come early for all of us in 2021 preferably on 2/3/21, thereby ensuring a VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR for all of us shareholders on not only 2/3/21, but for all the subsequent quarters to come.GLTA!"
"I'm itching to lighten up the load come Jan, these #s are just too scary for someone who's used to 2 digits."
"Who care about the sandbagged forecast? Next Quarter earning and revenue will beat the guided numbers with big margin again!Probably, there will be another guidance raise between now and Juy/August report!"
"Is it for another run or not, I have a feeling that QCOM should be valued for premium valuation, because of the suspended payment from contract. At the same time , smart phone 5G already starts on ads, it will be on sales in the fall. I know that China Huawei will be spearhead in China, Asia market. Samsung will not hesitate to get smart phone ready for 5G. So I guess AAPL can not wait for others to make the market. Let's see July when AAPL announces the new line of I-Phone, I think it may be a surprise."
I'm wondering why qcom has delved into the cloud and storage arena? tins of $ made there....

06:33 Today CitiQualcomm price target raised to $132 from $108 at Citi
I notice that Zacks has just reaffirmed its buy recommendation on QCOM!
Someone bought 2m shares in one lot after hour.
"Here's why Jacobs was 'removed' from the board:While he was chairman - the BOD claimed that AVGO's offer vastly undervalued the company. Now that he's gone, they can claim that the BOD statements under his leadership can not be taken seriously. The bar will be lowered (again) so the current CEO and other C level executives can milk this company for at least another 2-3 years."
"I think a lot of day-trading is done in QCOM stock, resulting in the ups and downs of their share price. QCOM is an excellent target for this type of trading, up and down of 2-3 points a day, so you can make a fair amount of profit( or loss) in a few days. This does not add to its stability and causes the price to tumble when you expect it to rise, and vice versa.Most major analyst have put a buy on QCOM based on its superior product, so just ignore the negative opinions, knowing that what counts is QCOM's result every quarter. So, don't pay attention to these negative opinions, hold the course, the shares will advance to exceed 100 and cherish its dividends. Don't sell, because you might look at a much higher price a day later! 99% of investors do not know what is going on in the company anyway, so let the stock ride, do not sell if it performs well ! Have a good time reading all these comments!!"
People should stop blaming this activist judge only. She made her judgment to side with the US government represented by the FTC (3-2 republicans Trump's appointee) against Q. The main blame should fall on the FTC and their Chairman (R).
"New Article on Apple and 5G; looks like Apple will be buy even more 5G chip modems from QCOM for next years phones.Copy and paste... with a comment...All three models of Apple’s 2020 iPhones will support 5G, according to TF Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.Kuo originally said just two would offer 5G support, but Apple will need to compete with lower-cost Android phones that have 5G. Apple has to compete so more sale bucks for QCOM!Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF Securities said in a note on Sunday that all three models of Apple’s 2020 iPhones will support 5G in order to better compete with 5G Android devices.In June, Kuo said only two models of Apple’s planned 2020 iPhones would ship with 5G support, while a third would only offer 4G LTE to help keep costs down. But competition against Android in the low-cost segment will force Apple to add 5G, Kuo said.“Apple has more resource for developing the 5G iPhone after the acquisition of Intel baseband business, ” Kuo said in his note. To be a so called top analyst, he has to know that the Apple modem chip business will be hard pressed to be producing their own Chips in one year, or maybe forever!! Most experts agree they are behind QCOM by 5 years or more! “We expect that the prices of 5G Android smartphones will decline to $249–349 USD in 2H20,” he added, noting that “consumers will think that 5G is the necessary function” by the time they’re launched. Kuo also said the more expensive iPhone models will need 5G to win favor from wireless carriers that will be pushing the new techn.Anyway this is great news for QCOM and Snapdragon!!"
More than twice the average volume for a stock price gain today of over $4/share is great for shareholders. At least a $100 after earnings. $125-$150 after apple starts selling its 5G phones. Thoughts.
qcom will do vgood with bright forecast
Why not FTC fine all mobile providers that over charging consumers $36 on the activation fee which consumers don't want to pay for and Apple over charge consumers on their all i-products? WHY WHY WHY FTC?
"Wow, never thought I would see qcom this low. What a discount...still holding to my shares and buying more at discounted price. My Price target $200 by end of 2021 and collecting dividends while I wait."
"Some want to believe Qualcomm is or will be growing at 20%. This is just plain wrong. Consensus for 2021 is 70% earnings growth. Why would that decline to 20% with IoT, 5G and automotive just starting to gain traction?"
Hearing rumors of Apple and MVIS deal in works. Any truth leaked?
"There’s Apple vs Epic Antitrust fights happening... if Apple is not using monopoly to charge excessive fee I don’t know what is? Apple is charging 30% fee while complaining that Qcom should charge them 1.5%... Although it’s been settled and behind us, I hope apple’s lose big time.."
Ask aapl what company has the best technology for their iPhone? as long as appl is booming qcom will continue to grow. also qcom is not dependent on appl. qcom technologies is very desirable to many other industries. Coronavirus headwinds are small in comparison with the large scale demand for 5g innovations that Qcom commads.
"Can anybody explain why Texas Instruments has a forward PE of 26x and is scheduled to grow at an average rate of 10% over the next five years? Meanwhile, Qualcomm scheduled to grow 25% average over that timeframe with a forward PE of 17x. Any explanation for this ?"
"From an article written by an analyst named Bruce Kamich for the Street titled QCOM was easily or third pick for 21, after a somewhat extensive analysis with no time frames mentioned, he's calling for a price target of $282.00!!Bottom line strategy... QCOM could have been one of the recommended stocks for 2021 but I went with 2 others. QCOM would have been third on the list for the coming year. Traders should approach QCOM from the long side & be prepared if weakness in the broader market knocks QCOM down to the $130 range that presents a buying opportunity. The $282 area is our longer-term price target.Personally, I don't think we'll se $130.00 as the earnings draws closer and hopefully not after, that would be a heck of a surprise call, which the evidence we have does not support."
"It Makes No Sense For Apple To Buy Intel's Modem Business https://seekingalpha.com/article/4277078?source=ansh $INTC, $SSNLF, $AAPL"

"I don't think qcom could be on that list of china's of unreliable entities. What is it, 60% of qcom's sales are in china? So wouldn't it be pretty surprising if they cut off their own firms from that large a supply source? Also, obv in this country there is no competitor to 5g modems. Does china have a competitor? If not, then they couldn't damage the qcom relationship since if they did, qcom would withhold (or be forced by our gov to withhold) 5g modems. I guess nothing should come as a surprise, it's just that there are pretty easy replacements in china for even apple, despite the damage of lost jobs re apple's supply chain in china. But at least it could deal w/ that. Could they so easily replace qcom's products?"
"EPS aapl portion is about $4. $3,75 -4, net w/o appl. PE=37, still ok, i guess"

Will 5G help increase earnings at QCOM? Any comments appreciated.
I thought I smelled a goldman rat the way the shares were behaving. I found this today:Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall reiterated a Sell rating and $122.00 price target on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and is cautious on QCT heading into Qualcomm’s upcoming FQ2 report given incremental potential for weakness driven by a key Samsung foundry shutdown in Texas.I detest that bank with every fiber of my body.
"I believe that Judge Curiel is taking the contracts literally, which should be good for Qualcomm's claims!"
What is going on with the earnings talk? The Q4 earnings grow was outstanding and increased substantially compared to the previuos Qs as well as Q4 2019 . Why this is down? I just bought a lot last Friday... just wondering...
In at $57.75. Collecting 4% dividend while waiting.
Getting cheaper after meeting!!!!!!! When a turnaround????
Was going to sell at 91.5 but am always afraid this will be the time it takes off. That makes now 5 times I didn't sell and replace and it always tanks about 7 or 8 dollars and goes back slowly.
"Maybe the company looking to buy Intel modem patents is not Apple, but Nokia or Ericsson. Both companies have been working with Intel on modems for years."
in 2009 Qcom was in the low 30s. while I wish it had performed better it has more than doubled. truth be told management from jacobs to current has imho destroyed the share price....that being said if youre long it doesn't matter if youew a day trader you made a killing playing the range. good luck to all.......
QCOM is the single best 5G play you will find. Fully expecting to trade $200 this year w a healthy dividend to boot. At last earnings call they not only gave guidance which everyone else was scared to death to do but they raised guidance. Tells me all I needed to know.
Down worse then all of other semi chips. Amazing how this is hitting fresh new lows like a knife through butter. Never ceases to amaze me on how they don’t like this company. It’s simply a poor stock
You’ll be very angry with yourself when you miss the next leg up to $120+ hoping it pulls back a couple more bucks from here. We will eventually start to catch up to the rest of the overpriced semis in the space with significantly less prospects going forward. Apple keeps rallying on 5G super cycle hype while the better of investment in QCOM lags. That’s not gonna go unnoticed for long.
Anyone in a $167? Lol 
"Please answer this question.When I bought in the middle of Oct. for $52.49, this stock was going nowhere. Only bought for the dividend.Then came along AVGO and the stock zoomed.Anyway, after the buyout got to be dicey, I sold @ $61.50 for a $9000.00 profit. I just got lucky on the tradeAnd now the stock is trending down.My question is this?What has changed from Oct until now?The NXP trade was already known.I don't see anything that has changed and I wouldn't be suprised if it goes back down to the low 50s.Replacing Mollenkopf is the key to move this stock higher."
Last two months have been a slow slog 9-10%. The next ten percent happens in a week. See you at 155 by Friday. One of the easiest buys still in the semi's.
"shorts had their fun ,now it's our turn"
Down a bit in ah after AAPL missed analysts expectations on iphone 12 sales. Services revs were exceptional. They beat analysts estimates in eps and revs but didn't give guidance.
Can't even stay above 138. Weak stock.
Apple also blows away this earnings. People like I have posted before 5G will be so much more than just phones. QCOM will be in every wireless application/hardware it will be leading almost all of the time and honestly I just don't see how this is not a trillion dollar company by 2025.

Tried to watch the Duke UNC game at a wedding reception on Saturday. I have a 6S iphone on Sprint and an 8plus iphone on AT&T. The sprint is personal and At&T is work. Modem sucked on the 8plus but worked great on the 6S. Guess which one was Qualcomm and which one was Intel? Apple went backwards adding the Intel modem to its 8 series. Mind boggling how Apple is dropping the ball for its customers. Just wondering when or if it will eventually catch up with them.

"Has anyone been to a wall street building where Hedge funds offices are? Parking garage filled with beautiful cars - these guys own yahts... these guys make a lot of money every month - millions go into their pockets and traders and those supporting their activities by running supercomputers, etc. All, or most, of that money is coming from the regular investors. They know how to run the system - up or down - short or long or both - coordinated or not - using analysts and trade rags for public opinion...on and on. We the retail investor does not control the stock price (except for that Reddit episode! ha ha). They know exactly when retail will break and sell, etc. I am saying all this because the only way to gain is a long term hold or gamble. Long term holds, such with QCOM eventually play out. As you can see with QCOM the TTM PE is now under 20 and future is something like 15 or 16. They will choose to turn the tables when they are ready and make money on this stock long. It is set up for that. Too many shorts in this now - so we get more gyration. Gamble... is trying to out think what they are doing and when... works sometimes. I find the long term leaps very profitable. Look at the Jan 22 Calls. Expensive, but you can buy them ITM with little premium if you go deep (like 75s). Good luck all - and have a nice weekend!"
"Yeah, I saw the Apple announcement and had to laugh. They spent years and millions trying to develop their own 4G modem with Intel and failed. So they buy Intels modem division and now think they can develop a 5G modem on their own. The reality is that any Apple modem must be a multi mode / multi band 3G/4G/5G modem to operate on all networks and facilitate domestic and international roaming. It's incredibly difficult to do that and Apple will never get there with the data speeds and low latency of QCOM modems. Qualcomm is also already doing it on a 5 nanometer process. Or. If they do, the world be on to 6G by then. My take from that announcement was that Apple wants to renegotiate their supply contract with QCOM and this is the only leverage they can conjure up."
"Qualcomm (QCOM) - has had quite a run since its March 23, 2020 low and investors are right to look through what will be a less exciting 2020 than initially thought, according to one analyst. Qualcomm is up 30% since that low, but still down for the year as earnings for 2020 have been revised lower on account of coronavirus. Semiconductor stocks have enjoyed a big run up and, like many stocks in the U.S. market, are now trading at elevated valuations on next 12 month’s earnings. Although part of the reason is lowered interest rates, investors are looking for a sharp recovery into the end of the year. But Qualcomm now trades at 17 times 2020 earnings per share, using FactSet consensus estimates, compared to its recent average of roughly 16 times. The reason: 2021 is looking to be a strong year, especially as 5G handsets make their way through production and into the hands of users around the globe. “Despite the near-term uncertain smartphone supply-and-demand environment, Qualcomm is well positioned to benefit from the long-term 5G investment cycle and anticipate recovering earnings in 2021 as 5G smartphones ramp, Apple reenters the model for QCT [a business segment] shipments, and global demand for smartphones improves,” wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley in a note after hosting a meeting with management. Economic activity is expected to recover in the second half of 2020, a trend currently looking much sharper in China than in the U.S. Excluding a second wave of virus outbreaks, this looks to be on track. Walkley is looking for 5G handset volumes between 175 million and 225 million in calendar year 2020, not a far cry from previous 2020 estimates. Combined with other revenue segments, this would translate to about $20.25 billion in sales for Qualcomm. But investors are more concerned with 2021 results and Walkley sees Qualcomm taking market share from other players in 5G chip sales in 2021, as the company is producing a powerful chip. Walkley is looking for revenue in 2021 to grow 29% to $26 billion, suggesting profit margins may expand too.Walkley also points out that Huawei, which the White House is disallowing from buying U.S.-made chips, does not represent much revenue for Qualcomm. According to research from Alliance Bernstein analysts, Huawei only accounts for roughly 5% of global semiconductor purchases. And according to CFRA analysts, Huawei only comprises roughly 3% of Qualcomm’s revenue, allowing other revenue streams to outweigh Huawei’s impact. Walkley has a $102 price target on Qualcomm shares, implying a 16.9 times multiple on his 2021 earnings forecast of $6.02 a share. Pre-virus, 5G-exposed chip makers were indeed trading at elevated multiples compared to their histories because the multi-year 5G ramp was expected to bring strong revenue and earnings growth. Walkley’s price target reflects 30% upside. Risks to the thesis on Qualcomm: stronger 5G competition from other makers or another virus crisis, disabling suppliers from building and consumers from buying, although the latter argument is rebutted by the industry’s position that 5G devices would be highly beneficial during a pandemic period."

Qcom sells only the modem chip to Apple.. this chip is less expensive than the SOC with the cpu processor which is sold to all of the other cell phone suppliers.

"Qualcomm charges maximum of $13 per phone. That's much less than what Apple charges for their cheap plastic charger that now you have to buy separately!. Please read below: In court filings and interviews, Qualcomm has argued that chip level licensing is not required under its agreements with Telecommunications Industry Association and the American National Standards Institute.In addition, the company contends component licensing misinterprets how cellular technology works.Qualcomm says its cellular inventions are not limited to a single piece of silicon such as the cellular modem. Delivering high-speed wireless broadband requires myriad chips and software working as a system not only inside smartphones but also across the broader cellular network.That’s why the cellular industry has licensed smartphone makers instead of chip suppliers for three decades. A chip level licensing requirement for Qualcomm would put it out of sync with the rest of the industry and the top standard setting organization in Europe, which has supported device-level royalties.For its standard essential cellular patents, Qualcomm charges 3.25 percent of the smartphone price up to a $400 cap – or a maximum of $13 per phone."

"Great article from Market Watch; below some comments, but read the whole article!! Also link below...The Market Watch writer, Daniel Newman says - I believe the case will be overturned on appeal.One of the most glaring red flags in the judge’s 233-page ruling is the conspicuous absence of any economic analysis whatsoever — which usually serves as a predicate basis for the proposed remedies in a ruling of this kind.I also find in the ruling no attempt to balance harm against benefits to consumers, whom Judge Koh claims — against all evidence presented at trial — were “hurt” by Qualcomm’s business model.Based on those two items alone, the ruling leaves itself wide open to be overturned on appeal. originally the most notable proponent of the FTC’s case, Apple settled with Qualcomm last month, essentially making this case moot. Apple had even attested to the superior quality of Qualcomm’s technology, acknowledged the need to have access to it, and agreed to the mutually beneficial terms of Qualcomm’s entirely legal licensing model.

Definitely last chance to get in cheap. Well it is a coin toss for earnings tomorrow. But next earnings will blow it out of the park. Remember 6 bil pay from Apple last week. Well I guess last week's jump is tied in to current SP. But... we all know with roll out of 5 G Qualcomm will have a shortage of their chip for next generation mobile phones. Especially after Intel decided to stop their roll out of their chip. Can't compete just join the rest.
"According to the M.F. this morning, 3 Best Tech Stocks to Buy in 2021A strong connection to 5G profits (Qualcomm): Thanks to 5G, investors can connect with this chip stock on a new level. Since Apple now sells 5G-compatible devices, the upgrade cycle has begun in earnest. With 5G offering speeds exponentially higher than that of 4G, most users will likely upgrade at some point.Qualcomm benefits because it is the only maker of a critical 5G chipset. This should remain true for at least the foreseeable future. Last year, Qualcomm persuaded a court to overturn a ruling that Qualcomm was a monopoly.Apple also dropped its lawsuits against Qualcomm in 2019. However, it did buy Intel's smartphone chipset business, presumably to someday offer a competing product.One can understand why Apple wants a piece of this market. This business is so large that Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63% through 2027.These increases have already begun to materialize. In its most recent quarter, adjusted revenue rose by 35% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share surged by 86% over the same period.Moreover, despite recent growth in Qualcomm stock, investors may not yet appreciate the value proposition. Even with the move higher, Qualcomm's forward P/E ratio stands at about 21. This is extremely cheap, especially considering the potential growth and Qualcomm's market position.Finally, as CEO Steven Mollenkopf retires, Qualcomm insider Cristiano Amon will take over the position. Amon spearheaded Qualcomm's 5G strategy. As he takes the helm, Amon could bring an added 5G focus that should help take Qualcomm higher in 2021 and beyond."

"Some key takeaway’s of the Marketwatch article!! With 5G handset shipments likely to more than triple from less than 200 million in 2020 to over 750 million in 2022, according to estimates compiled by Qualcomm, Qualcomm’s licensing, chipset and RFFE revenues are likely to experience a significant uplift as well.The Snapdragon platform’s versatility has also allowed Qualcomm to score some impressive design wins in extended reality (Augmented and Virtual Reality), voice and audio solutions, the IoT (including robotics platforms), mobile gaming and PCs. For reference, Qualcomm already counts over 11,000 IoT customers, with a SAM expected to reach $13 billion in 2022. In the PC/compute space, where the SAM is expected to reach $8 billion in 2022, Qualcomm’s partnerships with Microsoft and Lenovo to deliver always-connected 5G laptops with all-day battery life should be a strong growth opportunity.In the short term, the Ninth Circuit’s decision to overturn the lower-court ruling may not have had a big impact on Qualcomm. However, had the district court’s judgment been upheld, Qualcomm’s inability to fully monetize its more than 140,000 patents would have likely undermined its ability to keep properly funding the kind of R&D operation that allows it to pursue so many opportunities for licensing and hardware revenue.IHS Markit research from 2019 indicated that 5G will have $3.6 trillion in economic output by 2035 — and over $13.2 trillion when its contributions to adjacent industries are included. Qualcomm will benefit both directly and indirectly from the entire $13.2 trillion as its licensing and chipset business monetize 5G handsets and adjacencies.Now, without the handcuffs of uncertainty that have tethered the licensing disputes to the company’s entire innovation portfolio, Qualcomm is in a great position to deliver the returns investors have long been looking for."

They point to growth trends in data centers and video games. On Friday, Nvidia stock scored two price-target hikes. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and raised his price target to 500 from 400. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves kept his outperform rating on Nvidia stock and upped his price target to 461 from 385. In morning trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock rose 0.7%, near 423.20. Earlier in the session, it notched an all-time high of 426.21. Several Strong Quarters PredictedNvidia's data center business should see growth for several quarters thanks to new graphics processing units, Mosesmann said. That's due to the secular shift to accelerated computing, and the company's Mellanox acquisition, he added. Nvidia's gaming chip business will benefit from expected growth in high-end desktop and notebook PCs later this year, he said. ""Strength in both of these segments should last for several quarters, in our opinion, helping to drive overall revenues for the company,"" Mosesmann said in a note to clients. ""We continue to like the Nvidia story over the long term."" Nvidia is a beneficiary of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its processors power cloud computing services and video game machines, Steves said. The pandemic has forced many people to work from home and has boosted at-home entertainment such as video games. ""We continue to believe that NVDA will work higher through year-end and wouldn't be surprised to see the stock eclipse $450/share in the next 5-6 months,"" he said. Nvidia Stock 'New Bellwether In Semiconductors'Steves called Nvidia ""the new bellwether in semiconductors"" after passing Intel (INTC) in market value earlier in the week. ""Not only is the company tied to a secular growing industry, we believe their software assets should allow the company to drive higher-than-normal operating margins in the foreseeable future,"" he said in his note. Nvidia stock ranks third on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. Nvidia stock also is on IBD's Leaderboard stock watchlist. On April 7, Nvidia stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 275.50, according to IBD MarketSmith charts. Leaderboard analysis informed investors of a follow-on buy point at 367.37 from a three-weeks-tight pattern."

Remember, it was AAPL that was already calling the shots at this group earlier.From all corners, this looks more like an experiment. We can visit the scenario say 2 years after the acquisition is complete. Until then, it's just life as usual on the modem side of things. In the mean time, may be as an immediate first step, AAPL can rename these modems to: iModem or iConnect! That way the professional run websites out there can write reviews about how AAPL was able to improve the performance drastically immediately."

"By Karen Freifeld(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce on Friday lifted a ban on U.S. companies selling goods to ZTE Corp, allowing China's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker to resume business.The Commerce Department had said it would remove the ban after ZTE paid a $1 billion penalty and placed $400 million in a U.S. bank escrow account as part of a settlement reached last month.""While we lifted the ban on ZTE, the department will remain vigilant as we closely monitor ZTE's actions to ensure compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an emailed statement.ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.ZTE, which relies on U.S. components for its smart phones and networking gear, ceased major operations after the ban was ordered in April. The punishment came after the company made false statements about disciplining 35 employees involved with illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea, Commerce officials said. ZTE pleaded guilty and settled with Commerce last year over the illegal shipments.On Thursday, ZTE's Hong Kong shares surged some 25 percent after Reuters broke news the United States had signed an escrow agreement that paved the way for ZTE to deposit the $400 million. The $1 billion penalty was sent to the U.S. Treasury last month.The $400 million will stay in an escrow account for as long as 10 years to provide the U.S. government access to the money if ZTE violates the latest settlement.The June settlement also required ZTE to change its board and management, and to allow the U.S. government unfettered site visits to verify U.S. components are being used as claimed."

Judge by definition should be unbiased, be fair, objective and be loyal to government and its people she is serving. She failed to do all these. She never should have presided over this case, since in her mind Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust and she went out of her way to make sure she was right. She found Qualcomm violated Sherman antitrust act for not being fair, reasonable and non discriminatory and found Qualcomm to be monopoly. Judge Koh however had no problem with these traits found in her action during this trial."

"Did the board fulfill its duty based on the following (feel free to comment but would appreciate thumbs up/down to conduct an informal survey):Duty of care. The duty of care requires that directors be informed and exercise appropriate diligence and good faith as they make business decisions and otherwise fulfill their general oversight responsibilities. When reviewing plans to sell a company unit or to buy or merge with another company, the board must exercise proper oversight of management, especially with respect to issues of strategy and compliance with legal obligations such as mandatory disclosures. Pricing is another important consideration, and boards should be wary of claims of synergy. Academic studies offer mixed opinions on the track record for merger returns. Some find positive returns compared to non-acquiring peers (Petrova and Shafer, 2010), especially for frequent acquirers (Cass Business School and Intralinks, 2014). Other studies, for example a recent Fiduciary Group study citing McKinsey, claim a 70% failure rate.Duty of loyalty. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in the best interests of the corporation, including in the M&A context. Boards can maintain independence from an M&A transaction by appointing a standing committee of the board composed entirely of independent, non-conflicted directors to review the terms of a particular deal with the help of an independent third party, who can render a fairness opinion. (The National Association of Corporate Directors submitted an amicus curiae letter on this issue in May 2015.) For a substantive legal discussion of the board’s role in M&A transactions, see this article by Holly J. Gregory of Sidley Austin, which appeared in Practical Law (May 2014)."
"It is oversold obviously, that is why QCOM turns green since opening.

They are hungry to use it in E-commerce and entertainment. When HUAWEI hits Europe, the users will appreciate the speed of data transfer. I believe HUAWEI will settle with QCOM before the second quarter ends in order to rush the handset to the users. In China alone the demand is high and Asia will welcome the 5G, so the settlement will come sooner than later."

"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday asked a federal judge to delay a preliminary ruling in an antitrust case U.S. regulators brought against the mobile chip firm in order to pursue settlement talks.In a joint filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, the regulators and Qualcomm asked a judge to delay ruling on the FTC's motion for partial summary judgment for 30 days.What do you all think of the effect on the stock?"

Apple about to send a large check to Qualcomm
QCOM sales % up so much that is cheaper than nVDA and AMD.. and AAPL.
"Actually, let me correct myself, QCOM is trading at a forward PE of 20X based on 4.19 for 2020. However, if you apply of course the numbers of 6.10 they have for 2021 and apply a 20x PE, then of course by this years end, you get $122. I however believe by years end the estimates will be revised to more like $6.50 for 2021 giving it $130. As we all know as well, in many cases, a stock will get there sooner than one thinks because of momentum. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it print $125-130 as early as October, in my opinion"
"By the way, YTD Return for 2021 = Negative $14.00+"

The institutional owners of shares are the ones who will decide the fate of Qualcomm. that being said does anybody have any insight as to what would happen if possibly Texas Instruments or an IBM would be interested in acquiring Qualcomm and merging the synergies rather than selling off portions. at the end of the day I think most of an agreement that the current board and management need to be send packing. they have fumbled 3G and 4G. hopefully they don't mess up 5G. all intelligent people are welcome to respond"

U.S. trade judge recommends import ban on some Apple iPhoneshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-trade-judge-recommends-import-180746701.html
"Zero chance Qcom will lose ITC trial, actually it already won. The appeal is just to ban iphones in the USA. Since Apple said it already found a solution it proves Qcom was right. So Qcom will win and Apple will work around it as it did in Germany.The FTC trial is a different story, Judge Koh cannot be responsible for such an important decision. 5g is the future of everything and in the middle of China/USA trade war. USA needs Qcom, there is no other American chip maker close to Qcom. Intel knows about servers but its 5g chip is at least 2 years behind it. So I think after the Qcom wins ITC trial, FTC will be forced to reach a deal with Qcom.And Apple will soon follow it. Also I wouldnt be surprised if Apple goes back to using Qcom chip. It will not have a choice."
"A U.S. International Trade Commission judge said Apple's phones infringed one Qualcomm patent related to power management technology, but denied the chipmaker's request for a ban on the import of some iPhones into the United States. In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but ""it makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban.So Basically, US ITC is saying its ok to infringe patents as long as its in the interested of the public. So its ok to infringe on patents in all since infringed products are usually cheaper than genuine products and cheaper products are good for consumer and for the interest of the public. It also kind of make ITC themselves useless and invalidates their existence."

Today is the first time that I am making $$$ on chip stocks like: QCOM TSM INTC + DRNA GRWG PDCA PACB PLUG BLDP FCEL are for 2021 and beyond!
May see GREEN today guys despite the market sell off. The trend is up from $143-$144!
"The trading volume from yesterday told all that the big boys saw that QCOM will suddenly become the only US company that supplies 5G chipset. Huawei will dominate the low end market but QCOM will sweep the high end market. SAMSUNG, AAPL, LG, and PIXEL will use QCOM chipset for the spring and fall season. QCOM also receives the windfall withhold money from AAPL and the others. I guess QCOM does not need to buy back the stock, it may probably raise the dividends and raise the future earnings. Let's guess that QCOM will have the earnings around 6 dollars adjust after AAPL, plus dividends another $2.40, QCOM's PE will be around only 12 the most. I guess QCOM will raise the dividends, may be one time special dividends, it will ignite the stock value even higher. Let's see QCOM can hit 90 after FB and AMZN earnings report. which I guess it is very possible. If QCOM can hold 90s the sky will be limit next week."
"The talks with China will not effect QCOM, smart money will hold their shares and Buy more!KeyBanc’s John Vinh upgraded Qualcomm from Sector Weight to Overweight, with an unchanged price target of $105.The Qualcomm ThesisWith the restrictions placed on HiSilicon, Huawei will be unable to procure new silicon internally and may turn to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipset for its flagship 2021 smartphones, Vinh said in the note.This will require Qualcomm to obtain an export license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The analyst added that the license is likely to be granted and could be accompanied by a licensing agreement between Huawei and Qualcomm.Vinh expects this to add an incremental $2.33 billion to Qualcomm’s revenues and $1.13 per share to its earnings. He raised the revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2021 to from $23.7 billion to $27.9 billion and from $4.85 per share to $6.64 per share.The analyst said Qualcomm stands to benefit even if the export license is not approved. He explained that the license not being approved will impact Huawei and other Chinese smartphone manufacturers, which are already Qualcomm’s customers and licensees, will gain share.The USA does not care if Qcom 5G chips are in Huawei phones, the problem is the new 5G systems can not trust hardware and software made by Huawei. QCOM is in the cat bird seat, Huawei has to use QCOM 5G modem chips if it is going to make a top tier phone that can compete with other phone makers. The main point is Huawei 5G systems will not be secure if they control the whole system with spy stuff embedded in our 5G systems!! Americas security would be at risk with Huawei in it!"

"AAPL does this to all its suppliers. Threatens to build their own chips, displays etc. Customers rebel and only buy the premium component phones.

"Despite all the smoke and mirrors and noise QCOM is moving ahead with plans and launching new production in Vietnam.Qualcomm Expands 5G Development Via New Facility In VietnamBy Ramish Zafar / Jun 20San Diego, California-based chip giant Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), like other American companies, is caught in the middle of the trade war between the United States and China. The bulk of the modern tech industry's products are assembled in China due to easy access to labor and other incentives provided by local authorities. Additionally, the East Asian country's massive population also ensures that not all products that are assembled there are exported to foreign markets, with a big chunk of them also being consumed locally.Nevertheless, a souring of ties between the U.S. and China has caused several big tech giants to look for contingencies to their operating plans in the off event that affairs go fully south. With this in mind, we've got more information today for Qualcomm's research and development plans for its modems and other smartphone radio front-end chips for current and next-generation cellular technologies.Qualcomm Snapdragon 875, Next-Gen Modem Based on 5nm Node Reportedly Go Into Production at TSMC FacilityQualcomm Opens New R&D and Testing Facility In Hanoi, Vietnam For Modem and Radio Front-End ChipsThe information is courtesy of a new report published on the Vietnamese website 24h, and it reveals that the facility is located in Hanoi, Vietnam. Its purpose is to assist Qualcomm in developing new cellular technologies and to allow the company's local manufacturing partners to test out their products.Within the testing center, Qualcomm will also look to developing image sensing applications ion addition to focusing on radio front-end modules for smartphones. Three sub-facilities, which include a radio frequency (RF) laboratory, a laboratory designed to test power consumption and performance metrics (PPT) and a laboratory designed to adjust image sensors and gauge the quality of sensor results.Given that Qualcomm does not produce camera sensors, the term 'image sensor' as available in the translation of 24h's report refers to either the company's image signal processors (ISPs) that are integrated within a Snapdragon system on chip (SoC) or to Qualcomm's virtual fingerprint recognition sensors that also take the image of a user's appendage for security verification.￼￼Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7nm 5G modem (right) and the QTM 525 mmWave antennas pictured. The QTM 525 is crucial in allowing the San Diego chip giant to maintain a lead over its 5G competitors. (Image Credit: Qualcomm Incorporated)While the report does not explicitly state whether Qualcomm will also test 5G chips in the facility, it's clear that the next-generation cellular standard will play some role in the plant. One of Qualcomm's partners in Vietnam, VinSmart research and production, has already entered into a partnership with Qualcomm and Fujitsu to manufacture 5G smartphones in Vietnam. This will be carried out in the Hoa Lac Hi-tech Park in Hanoi, and it will be powred bt a Snapdragon 5G modem and IP68 and power management features from Fujitsu.Yet, despite Qualcomm's decision to open a new plant in Vietnam, it's impossible for the company to move its modem fabrication facilities in the country as well. Right now only Samsung (in Korea) and TSMC (in Taiwan) have the technical capability needed to print circuits on the level of minuteness required for a bleeding-edge 5G modem.To that end, TSMC is expected to commence producing orders for its advanced 5nm manufacturing process soon, and one of the customers is rumored to be Qualcomm. The outbreak of the coronavirus has put a dent in the San Diego-based company's high hopes for 5G market demand, and performance of upcoming products including Apple Inc's new smartphones will determine the consumers' mood towards next-generation connectivity standards at a time when purchasing power is shrinking and the need to work and study from home is rising."
"TSMC monthly sales are recovering, great sign for Q: https://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/ExtIRListingMonthlyAction.do?action=listByYear"

I own Apple n QCOM. I very much doubt that QCOM can win its case against Apple. However QCOM has the best 5G out there. Xilinx stock jumped $20 on its growing 5G sales to China n South Korea. I believe that QCOM earnings will show big 5G sales as well.

I RULE IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANT. ALL CHARGES DISMISSED"
The bottom is near.
"Reg. Import Ban in Germany: As known, Munich Court found that Apple infringed patent of Q and the court ordered an import ban and to stop selling certain IPhones. Based on German law, the producer (Apple) has to undertake serious activities to make sure that products are being withdrawn. However, in press releases Apple did rather the opposite by informing that these IPhones remain available in the trade, but not in Apple Stores. Q filed a complaint, the court came back with an injunction that Apple has to withdraw the press release and is not allowed to repeat. In a further complaint, Q is arguing that Apple does not undertake serious steps to withdraw IPhones and wants Apple to be fined. Normally fines could be between 5 and 250.000 € per violation (in rare cases imprisonments of CEO could be ordered). Q had to deposit almost 1.4 billion €, in case the injunction of sales stop would be overruled from an appellate court; Apple appealed the sales stop, whilst the injunction had immediate effect. Apples behaviour (press release) could lead to a situation, that the court feels mocked; the fine also in context with Q deposit of 1.4 billion (not million) € could be hefty. Other patent infringement cases are partly decided, either Apple or Q are to appeal the court decisions. Partly the European Patent Office is involved, which will move final decisions to May. Only if the German Courts reacts very harsh on Apples a.m. behaviour, a General settlement seems to be possible. Personally I think ,only‘ a fine will be ordered by the Court. Today there was a press release on finance.yahoo that Apple works on a workaround reg. the infringed patent. As the infringed patent is a hardware component, there is quite some skepticism around this workaround. The German court for sure will want to understand precisely what Apple intends to do (whilst imposing the fine). Again, the situation in Germany may only trigger a settlement, in case the court feels mocked or even more. This will bring more attention to the ITC case, where decision was postponed to late March. The ITC tribunal will decide on an import ban in the US due to another patent infringement."
Price / Sales now less than 4 with Revenues increasing 30-50%.
Just looking at recent results from nxpi. 45% of their net revenues was derived from automotive. They had a nice beat yesterday and was able to slightly raise guidance.

"I am looking at 5G from start to end with the chip manufacturers, phone makers, network carriers, and Phone tower owners. Most of what I see is that the world still does not believe that 5G is important, or that it is ready to be rolled out (Forget about 6G! for now). I would have expected that the 5G roll out would have been on the way by now, but it seems that even at its basic concept 5G is not moving, and I don't even see the infrastructure laid in for the next year or so. I am looking at the carriers (that should by now have engaged the tower owners), or for more real estate on the towers, and the phone makers to announce the ""REAL"" 5G devices.If the process as a whole is not engaged, then the concept of 5G is not valid for the foreseeable future.I am not saying that 5G is not going to happen, or that QCOM is not going to grow (I can see it being $400+ in the future), but I can't really see it happening in the next year or so. So I will agree with @Louie that for right now it's a waiting game, and if you want your money to be producing $$ right now, you must invest to another stock.

"Here is a summary of 10+ number of non-SEP patents found to be valid by PRB review in China and only 2 of them are being used in the current injunction with more PRB decisions to come. So for all those who actually believed APPL about the whole IOS 12 ""workaround"" or how the injunction is not enforceable. Think again, this injunction can be just a start if APPL does not come to its sense and quit trying to bully and destroy its supplier. ---From previous IAM reports on the Qualcomm vs Apple PRB struggle in China ( Patent review board) : According to a search of the PRB’s public database, Apple has challenged the validity of 22 Qualcomm-owned Chinese patents during 2018.

It will be a busy holiday season for both sides’ counsel in China.So far, the PRB has issued decisions on 12 Qualcomm patents. Apple has notched just two total wins, and two partial ones.

"Tidbit from AAPL conference call...draw your own conclusions but IMO Q4 was just the very beginning of an extremely robust 5G cycle...and they didn’t even have their best selling phones (Pro and Pro Max) until half way thru the quarter. Luca MaestriSo on the December performance, as you know, Toni, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so, we had an initial part of the quarter where, obviously, we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched the new phones, we also did the channel fill that typically happens, to a certain extent, in the September quarter.At the end of the quarter, the demand has been very strong. And so we've been constrained, as I said, on -- especially in the Pro models. At the end of December, we exited with a level of iPhone channel inventory, which was slightly below a year ago. So we -- and we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter.In terms of the sequential change, we talked about -- during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly, last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, fiscal '17, '18, '19, that's our typical seasonal progression.And we mentioned a couple of product categories, Services and Wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your conclusions around the iPhone."

Intel announced on late Tuesday it will exit the 5G smartphone modem business.In similar fashion, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay on Tuesday reaffirmed his Outperform rating for Qualcomm shares after the Apple settlementWe believe shares remain undervalued even after [Tuesday’s] 23% move,” he wrote. “Our checks have consistently pointed to Qualcomm’s ~1-year+ technological leadership in 5G modems versus peers.”Looking ahead. Cassidy raised his price target for Qualcomm to $100 from $57, while Ramsay increased his target to $91 from $70.The back story. On Tuesday, the companies announced they reached a six-year license agreement, effective April 1, and a multiyear chipset supply agreement. The deal includes a payment from Apple to Qualcomm and ends all ongoing litigation between the companies.Previously, Apple had said Qualcomm was overcharging for its wireless patents, while Qualcomm said Apple wasn’t paying it the full royalties required.Yes Apple had to blink, and Snapdragon did it!!

"I think that the current Qualcomm Board of Directors could be doing a much better job than they are, however, I think it would be extremely reckless to elect Broadcoms board members who have no experience whatsoever in any of these fields.

I own 5k of qcom and I will vote blue. I will sue qcom management if the stock price continue to deterioate

"Broadcoms bids will be much higher soon. They have an unlimited pool of capital provided to them from a little company that really wants the current royalty payment model to go away. They are a company that wants to sell phones for 2,000 a piece.They are a company has amassed 250,000,000,000 in cash from the technology that Qualcomm developes and licenses. Can you guess the company. No, Broadcom will have no problem coming up with capital to do this deal Apple will make sure of this. Question is really anti-trust approval and if Mr Mollekopft and company interest in giving up the company. This is going to get very interesting, Apple really wants the current Royalty system to go away, Broadcom is a vehicle to get rid of the model through a very large cash payment to Qualcomm's senior Management and Institutional investors. Note Broadcom is a vehicle that Apple is indirectly involved with to take out Qualcomm. HOLD SHARES TIGHTLY. STOCK IS GOING UP."

"Yahoo Finance today is running a story about how Yangtze, a Wuhan based Chinese company, can now build a complicated 128 layer chip like Qualcomm. We know with patent applications, the Chinese see the patent ideas online months or years before the chip is ready for production. Some times China starts production of their copied chip BEFORE the developing company does. No doubt the chip was reverse engineered and copied. No doubt Bezinga, who ran the story, is on the Chinese payroll. When we work through the virus, and the infection is gone, we re going to have to fight the Chinese infection of our politicians and our college teachers, and our news services.

Nightmare before Christmas to QCOM employeesQualcomm announced that its Board of Directors approved a $16 billion accelerated stock repurchase agreement as part of a $30 billion stock repurchase program announced in July. “We remain on track to complete a large majority of the announced program by the end of fiscal 2019,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf. “The Board and the management team remain committed to returning capital to stockholders while we also continue to invest to create longer term stockholder value.” The repurchase will be funded by existing cash resources.Furthermore, Qualcomm has been embroiled in antitrust lawsuits in the past couple of years and has had to pay billion-dollar fines, and its NXP acquisition was cancelled, which forced the company to cut another $1 billion dollar in costs and lay off 1,200 employees.Qualcomm continues to shed workers in San Diego and elsewhere as part of a pledge to shave $1 billion in annual costs: 269 jobs in California and North Carolina. It disclosed the layoffs in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices filed with the employment agencies in both states. At its San Diego headquarters, Qualcomm is letting go 125 workers. In North Carolina, 144 workers are losing their jobs. Layoffs take effect in early February.Qualcomm has all but eliminated its server chip division, cutting its workforce from about 1,000 employees earlier this year to only 50.

Apple and intel deal? This is the very reason why companies should never do business with Apple. Intel has spent billions of dollars to develop modem base band for years. Apple killed intel modem business and buying its business for mere 1 billion? It’s good thing intel is big enough company to overcome this financial disaster because if it was small size business like imagination graphic chip company ( which was also bought by other company for not going chapter 11) it would never have survived it. Apple may bought this in bargain price but will never be able to fully utilize its patents and its technologies. Qualcomm is 5g leader now and will be 6g leader later and beyond.

"Guys, no worries for Qualcomm. Always remember that Qualcomm Goes Beyond Core Mobile Market and Apple In These Growth Segments: https://finance.yahoo.com/video/qualcomm-goes-beyond-core-mobile-192453316.html"
"Augmented reality (AR) glasses are one of the most talked about technologies of the future. The idea of taking the functionality of a smartphone and turning it into a hands-free, wearable device that can intelligently interact with the world around us is the goal for many. The path to that goal has proven difficult at times, and although companies continue to make progress, the often asked question is, how long until truly smart AR glasses become a reality?As with so many areas of emerging technology, it pays to listen to those involved in the silicon layer. Identifying the next major step in the semiconductor market can provide a clear insight into the world of tomorrow, as the next wave of devices will harness these chipsets and platforms for power and performance. That’s why I think the latest news from Qualcomm’s extended reality (XR) division is so significant.This week, the company announced a new reference design for AR viewer devices based on its Snapdragon XR1 platform. The design showcases a split-processing approach, meaning the viewer can share computing workloads with a host device, such as a smartphone or PC. In contrast, existing XR viewers, such as the Nreal Light device, don’t hold any processing power on-board, relying on the host device for its performance entirely.Why does this matter? Well, to return to the original question, I believe this is an important next step on the journey toward fully-fledged AR glasses, and the next generation of spatial computing. The split-processing approach will help to solve some of the problems facing today’s XR viewers, providing a stepping stone to even better devices and richer computing experiences.For example, a problem with today’s XR viewers is that the devices fully rely on a host for their power. Qualcomm says that the split-rendering approach, assisted by computing power within the viewer, will pave the way for XR viewers that use up to 30% less power overall than the current crop of devices — that’s a huge improvement.The additional processing power will also lead to new uses. For instance, users on a smartphone or a laptop should be able to run multiple virtual displays within their field of view, making it easier and simpler to engage with 2D content in XR. And, in time, newer 3D applications designed to take advantage of these devices will revolutionize the way we socialize, work and play together.Much like the way the virtual reality market is segmenting as it matures, with devices targeting a variety of uses, different AR device designs will play to different strengths. Simple viewers like the Nreal Light offer a lightweight, simple design for things like streaming content, whereas designs based on a split-processing approach will be more valuable to enterprise customers in the shorter term; Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 glasses, launched at CES 2021 are an early example.Still, consumer uses like media consumption and gaming will emerge and find space in the market. And as we’ve seen in virtual reality, improvements come quickly in areas including displays, tracking and user interface, delivering continuously improving experiences that will roll down the price curve over time.Naturally, the next step will be taking this approach to a wireless design, a view shared by Qualcomm, which has said that this is the next step on its journey. The company has already achieved wireless split-processing in the virtual reality space with what it calls “boundless XR” technology. So realistically, once we see this distilled into AR devices, we’ll only be a half step away from powerful AR glasses that are indistinguishable from a pair of spectacles.As a result, it feels like the promise of AR glasses is sharpening into focus. As a major player helping to build the XR ecosystem, Qualcomm’s view of the future is clearer than most, and as the silicon provider of choice for major XR devices, it’s important to pay attention to its reference designs. I’d argue that this update gives us the best look yet at the future of AR, as well as the steps required to deliver truly smart glasses and the next generation of mobile computing.￼"
Trump's recent strategic defense initiative which calls out 5G wireless connectivity as being Strategically Important to US national security is a clear signal that QCOM will not be sold to a foreign entity like Broadcom

"Investors Broadcom's Hock Tan does not have QCOM investors' interest at heart. He is trying to low ball Qcom investors with best and final, while creating huge value for Broadcom investors.Be smart, don’t let Hock underpay Qcom investor by voting white to ensure negotiation process is fair and not one sided.Hock needs Qcom, 1. he is afraid Of Qcom’s new line up in RF taking away Broadcom’s bread and butter. 2. He is salivating over Qcom’s intellectual Property. As Broadcom does not have much to show in the way of innovation. 3. Hock needs to position Broadcom ahead in the 5G race, and there is no faster way to get there other than acquiring Qcom to cut down the R&D. For the very same reasons above and the acquisition of NXPi, Qcom will have a very bright future as an independent company. Just look at all the technologies and customers Qcom has lined up, and it’s all there in public information, you will get the sense of how exciting things are at Qcom.Let’s get it done by voting white!"

"Result of option trading keeps it down, I think. EU fine clear, support from DoJ etc....Apple working full steam on 5G, TSM showing momentum. Snapdragon well positioned. The moment, the stay is granted, it takes off."
"Go read Daniel Newman, analyst from Futurum Research, on Twitter. Really calls BS on AAPL story. Small sample…Building a Modem Takes Time and Requires Complex Regulatory and Operator ApprovalsMore likely, the migration away from Qualcomm will be a multi-tiered process that will take time. Many see this transition as the same as the migration off of Intel to M1; this isn’t the case. First of all, the complexity of the modem is much greater than the CPU. For instance, the 5G-RF system built by Qualcomm is complex and requires massive investment, testing, and refinement to make it work as well as it does. Further, Qualcomm, which is part of 3GPP, and Apple, which is not, need to work closely with the cellular infrastructure providers to extract optimal performance from the modem. This process is highly complicated as the modem isn’t a standalone device; it needs to coordinate and negotiate with operator equipment to send information back and forth.Then interoperability and acceptance testing, and certification will be required in every country, and approval needed from each government regulator equivalent to the U.S. FCC. This will be a lengthy and costly process, and one that can only begin once Apple has a working modem. A similar approach will also have to be done with all operators to assure proper operation on their networks, and with their equipment. Again, this is going to take a ton of money and time. Not suggesting Apple can’t or won’t do it. But it isn’t the same as using an Arm instruction set to build a CPU for the M1 Mac. This is also a recurring expense, as new features are introduced in the modem every year, and certification is required for every new modem. The implication here is that it’s not clear where Apple will use these new modems, or how it will phase them into different products over time.It May Happen, but not likely by 2023Building a 5G modem and making it fully viable in the communication ecosystem will be a major lift. It isn’t by any means an impossibility, but it will be exponentially more complicated. This entire concept of designing Qualcomm out of the iPhone may be a real plan, or it may merely be a negotiating tactic (or both). Most likely, this will last a few years longer than 2023. First, Apple will have to build a discrete modem, go through the quality and testing, and make sure it works incredibly well. Then at some point, integrate it into its mobile SoC (A14 or A15) or other product (e.g. Mx).All in all, most of this is conjecture. Apple is taking steps to build its modem to eventually have an SoC with its own 5G modem embedded. But don’t be surprised if this is more posturing in the short term for better terms and if ultimately it takes a few more years than expected to build an Apple Modem–If ever."
nothing like a 3% move upward to get one psyched for the weekend!
"In markets beyond handsets, where Qualcomm is expanding, the company did well in Q1. Revenue rose 48% for Internet of Things; 256% for radio-frequency front end; and 44% for automotive.Analysts expect Qualcomm earnings per share to rise 72% in all of fiscal 2021, then increase a further 13% in 2022. The company returned to growth in 2020 after several years of declines.https://www.investors.com/research/qualcomm-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220"

if QCOM is so essential to national security one would think the share price would be much higher.
All in all I think it has a bright future. I think it’s a great long term stock to be in or to put in your watchlist. http://profiledstockpicks.com/OnDemandDelivery

$65 tomorrow. $80 after a few upgrades coming soon! QCOM fully eqipped to charge ahead now!!
Follow the trend. Fed may hold or reduce interes rate. Qcom is free on all ligititation and now FTC will be in favour. So good luck
"To those of you making comments about apple making their own modem: first of all, Qualcomm was already in the process of replacing the entire revenue stream coming from Apple by their diversification into adjacent markets. It's great to see apple business back, but in a few years qualcomm will be so much more diverse that they won't endure such a grave hit from one customer. Second, if apple wants to stay competitive in the smartphone markets, they will ALWAYS buy at least a significant portion of their modems from qualcomm simply because they're the best, by apple executives' own admission. Third, qualcomm makes much more money selling a Snapdragon chip than a modem chip to Apple. Every other customer buys Snapdragon except for Apple, which means qualcomm's strategy in making Android stronger will pay off big time in long term and reduces their exposure to Apple even further! So stop worrying and don't fall into Apple's trap of always threatening their suppliers. Qualcomm is the most innovative company!!!"
"enough already. the tech that makes an iPod into an iPhone is qcom. what jurisdiction could possibly justify manufacturing, sellig and conspiring with other companies to withold fees? its time apple paid up. its not like they don't already overcharge their loyal customers. Apple pay for what you USE ACCORDING THE AGREEMENT YOU SIGNED AND WHAT IS THE INDUSTRY STANADARD"
The Hedge Funds aren't buying or selling based on some stupid analyst's call. And no one on any message board making positive or negative comments about any stock has any influence whatsoever on the price of the stock.
My math may be a bit off here but if AAPL started making all their own silicon immediately they would still have to pay QCOM about 25 $/phone for a full spectrum license. At run rate of 300 million phones per year and EBT margin of 77% for license QCOM this translates to about $5.77/share EBT assuming 1 billion shares outstanding. This doesn’t include the benefit of additional capacity that’s freed up to sell more Snapdragons instead of AAPL modems.

I've got good news!It will bounce back!...once it drops to zero.
Going below 139.
there are no point guys to sell qcom at this pricelook like some day traders are manipulating price ..I am more than 100% sure qcom will go above 90 after earning
Analysts are saying earnings will only grow 10% next year. Here’s why that number is way low…1) Currently only 20% of RF front ends are mmwave. QCOM gets a huge premium here. That percentage should easily double next year as mmwave is rolled out in China and other countries via iPhone 14 and other Chinese brands.2) 5G phones this year should run approx 50% of total phones sold.m or 500 million units. Next year that number can easily increase 50% to 75% of phones sold or 750 million units. 3) Now if I take a 50% increase in 5G phone volumes and a 100% increase in mmwave and suddenly you go from 20% x 500 million phones x QCOM market share to 40% x 750 million x QCOM market share which gets you to a minimum of 3X the number of phones with mmwave QCOM will sell in 2022 compared to 2021. Holy cow!4). Throw on top of this the massive capacity increase coming on line this year to not only support the increase above but to also accelerate the growth in iOt and autos and address the Huawei 10 billion $ dollar TAM available. Gotta stop here. The story just keeps getting better.
how about $100/share qcom
Pure manipulation is over. Time to go below 140.
150 this week
time in the market not timing the market earnings matter
Conference call was not an honest picture of what is going on with Qualcom. I would not buy here. I see more downside from here.
"Huawei & ZTE declared security risks by FCC on Tuesday and the US Senate has now passed this... The U.S. Senate today voted unanimously to pass the Secure and Trusted Telecommunications Networks Act. Written as a response to recent concerns around Chinese hardware manufacturers, the bill would ban purchase of telecom equipment from embattled Chinese manufactures like Huawei and ZTE.H.R. 4998, which passed the House last December, would also include $1 billion in funding to help smaller rural telecoms “rip and replace” existing equipment from specific manufacturers. The bill still needs to be signed off by Trump in order to become a law, though Politico notes that the administration has already acknowledged support for the funding, which would be managed by the FCC.“Telecommunications equipment from certain foreign adversaries poses a significant threat to our national security, economic prosperity, and the future of U.S. leadership in advanced wireless technology,” Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi said of the bipartisan bill in a statement. “By establishing a ‘rip and replace’ program, this legislation will provide meaningful safeguards for our communications networks and more secure connections for Americans. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming together to help move this bill to the President’s desk.”Huawei in particular has been the focus of U.S. concern over alleged ties to the Chinese government for a number of years. The Trump administration has targeted the company over spying concerns — charges Huawei has long staunchly denied. Last May, the company was added to an entity list, effectively barring U.S. companies from conducting business with the hardware giant."

And some handset vendors are likely to adjust their AP inventories in the latter half of the year.Digitimes Research estimates that APs for 4G smartphones will remain the mainstream of shipments to China in 2021, accounting for over 50% of total shipments.In the second half of 2021, the ratio of APs built using 4/5nm nodes will reach 7% of all AP shipments, and 5nm products will be the majority in the 4/5nm segment.China will continue to be the largest outlet for 5G APs in 2021, taking up 56% of the global total, with Qualcomm, MediaTek and Samsung Electronics being the top-3 vendors.Both Qualcomm and MediaTek will see their market share increase significantly in the year, with the former enjoying a higher growth rate."

$QCOM beat big time!!!
"QCOM IN INDIA...Qualcomm has become the newest high-profile backer of four-year-old Reliance Jio Platforms, which has raised more than $15.7 billion in the past 12 weeks from as many investors. On Sunday evening, Qualcomm Ventures said it will invest $97 million in Reliance Jio Platforms to acquire a 0.15% equity stake ""on a fully diluted basis"" in the top Indian telecom operator. Qualcomm said it will help Jio Platforms ""roll out advanced 5G infrastructure and services for Indian customers."" Reliance Jio Platforms, which competes with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in India, has disrupted the Indian telecommunications market by offering cut-rate voice and data plans. It has amassed nearly 400 million subscribers to become the top carrier in the world's second largest internet market in less than four years of its existence. Its dominance in the Indian telecom operator while maintaining an ARPU (average revenue per user) that match those of its rivals has made Reliance Jio Platforms -- a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, India's most valued firm -- an attractive firm for a roster of high-profile investors. Facebook, Silver Lake, General Atlantic, Intel are some of the firms that have backed Jio Platforms at the height of a global pandemic. Jio Platforms has sold 25.24% stake in the firm during the period. The digital unit for Reliance Industries also operates a number of digital services including streaming services for music, live TV channels, and movies and TV shows. Earlier this month, the Indian firm added a new service to its arsenal: A video conferencing service. Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm, said the firm believes that Reliance Jio Platforms ""will deliver a new set of services and experiences to Indian consumers"" in the future. ""With unmatched speeds and emerging use cases, 5G is expected to transform every industry in the coming years. Jio Platforms has led the digital revolution in India through its extensive digital and technological capabilities. As an enabler and investor with a longstanding presence in India, we look forward to playing a role in Jio's vision to further revolutionize India’s digital economy,” he said in a statement. India’s richest man built a telecom operator everyone wants a piece of Some investors have told TechCrunch in recent months that Reliance Jio Platforms' owner -- India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani -- and his closeness to the ruling political party in India are also crucial to why the digital unit of Reliance Industries is so attractive to many. They believe that buying a stake in Jio Platforms would lower the regulatory burden they currently face in India. The investors requested anonymity as they did not wish to talk about the political tie ups publicly. A person familiar with the matter at one of the 12 firms that has backed Reliance Jio Platforms said that the Indian firm is also enticing as globally companies are trying to cut down their reliance and exposure on China. India, and the U.S., in recent months have taken actions to limit their reliance on Chinese firms. New Delhi last month banned 59 apps and services including TikTok that are developed by Chinese firms. Reliance Jio Platforms has interestingly yet to raise capital from any Chinese investor. ""Qualcomm has been a valued partner for several years and we have a shared vision of connecting everything by building a robust and secure wireless and digital network and extending the benefits of digital connectivity to everyone in India,"" said Ambani in a statement Sunday."
Wish I had some funds for this buying opportunity today... Qualcomm will continue to dominate and grow.It's not all about cell phones.
"Cristiano AmonHappy to answer the question. By the way, we get the question all the time. And I think my opinion, Stacy, I don’t think investors should be thinking this like in binary terms. Like when we think about our relationship with Apple, we are very happy.We have restored the relationship. We are developing great products together. And the way we think about it, we don’t make any heroic assumptions on our business with Apple. We think about it, that is a business that is going to be very stable, much like our business with Samsung.Samsung has gone and developed their own platform. I would say they have more assets than Apple does to do it. They have an infrastructure business, which is growing. They have a semiconductor business in very large scale. And they have built a solution, and we have built a very stable relationship over the years as we continue to move technology forward to about a 50% share, give or take, within Samsung.That is how we think about Apple. And I’m sure they are a great company. They are going to be focused on developing the platform. And if they succeed, there is always going to be room for a company like Qualcomm driving the premium technology. I think companies that they go into the vertical transition, they look at optimizing building materials.They look at how to have a common platform they can use in a number of devices from phones to watches to different things, and Qualcomm will continue to be focused on driving the modern technology for. That is the number one core competence of the company. That is what we do for a living.The other way for you to think about it, we also were very excited. We don’t want to speculate or making any disclosures, but I’m telling you, we are very excited about rebuilding the relationship with Apple and opportunities to expand you, we are very excited about rebuilding the our relationship even to other products beyond the modem, for example, to RF front end.So I think we are just the beginning of our journey with Apple, and we are very happy with the relationship. Great products they launch, including looking at the millimeter-wave penetration of their products as well as the price points. That is great news for millimeter-wave."
This stock is really giving me heartburn 
Institutional ownership holding nasdaq data Qualcomm: 82.50 % !!!
Hope it closes at over $140
looks to me like a total beat...no downgrades as a result .....only the 5g rollout coming down the pipeline.. more revenue and more share repurchasing...
What you think will QCOM worth (with the NXPI deal) even if the Broadcom deal does not go through?
"Given this morning’s 5G oem partnership and carrier trial announcement, it would seem that the board is leaning towards a no ?"
"company is buying back 50M shares in upcoming quarter, clearly they see value at this price. pretty sure its going to climb"
Ouch
"For all of those uneducated posters that don't think the pps will approximate the deal price almost immediately, remember QCOM jumped from $51 to $68.91 when the $70 deal was announce and BEFORE a deal was even agreed to. It only pulled back on rejection of the deal."
"Nasdaq pre market up 184, will we ride the wave of a strong markets tomorrow, if so there is a little less of a chance of games and manipulation!"
Apple is preparing a large check to be sent to QCOM.
Snapdragon Tech Summit 2020 is being held Dec 1 and 2nd. THAT'S TOMORROW!!!! Should be some interesting applications on display.....
All I hear is good things about QCOM yet the share price does nothing but go down. What is up with that??
"what do you think is better to buy now after the correction, QCOM or AVGO? Both have huge upside potential and nice dividends."
"Yes ,do they have the chips? Now Taiwan is reducing production because of water supply problems"
"Although not likely, theoretically CFIUS could block a deal (but probably not until after a deal is struck). What they cannot do is prevent the six new directors from being elected. Nor can they prevent the new BoD from cutting R&D and operating QCOM like a private equity would. Thus all of the concerns about what ""could"" happen if a deal went through remain even absent a deal."

These license deal are pure profit. i.e. profit margin 100%..I think QCOM stock price is underetimated.. should be $200 right now.
"QCOM is worth 100, minimum - accept no less"
Lets review the past monthSP increased 20% on great earnings Hauwei agrees to settle and pay 1.8 billion Ftc case gets thrown outQcom only up 20% from precovid high!Apple 5g growth not started yet and will add to sales and margin on increase royalties We are not even in first innings of 5G growth curveWe get paid 3% dividend to enjoy the ride in 5G future Qcom not over extend on trading at less 20 pe future earnings.Waiting for upgrades b4 this rises to next level .. Qcom is both growth stock and value stock at these low levels
"Nice, but still significantly undervalued"
qcom skyrocketing. Going to 80.
"So Ms Koh stands by her revengeful and heavily misinformed decision, which is pretty much a death sentence for QCOM license business. It will wipe out 75% of their operating income. Also on grand scheme of things I see two main problems here: 1) All the inventors have no incentive to invent and patent their ideas 2) Anybody licensing any patent what so ever can claim royalties are unfair and stop paying."
Intel halted the bidding process and sold the unit exclusively to Apple. There was no point where QCOM could get it. To me auction was just a staged drama. Intel was foolish enough to sell it for only $1bn. Remember QCOM blaming intel of stealing software. Its the same team now under Apple banner. And can reverse engineer QCOM ip to some extent. 6+ years of support from QCOM and Apple will come up with their own modem just like they did for the smartphone SoC.

Vote blue for $82Vote white for less than $60 stock priceSeems like an easy decision. All we nee is a plurality of shareholders to put Broadcom's director slate in the majority position.
"No Qcom chips in iPhone, why Q got impacted by Apple bad news? They’re well deserved, but it’s so unfair to Qcom."
forget about who has upper hand. QCOM and AVGO both wants deal to be done but at what price. If QCOM would have said 90 when they had meeting this would have been done. NXPI deal made AVGO angry. AVGO reduced the price to show that they are angry. Now that period is over and meeting is coming next week. They both know deal could go either way so they will negotiate by Monday and announce something . This is what history says. wait until last moment. Last moment is Monday.

"One Step Closer to Nationwide 5G: T-Mobile, Qualcomm and Ericsson take Massive Step Toward Delivering Broad 5G on Low-Band Spectrum"
Question for the board. I noticed EPS estimates have not budged since the AAPL announcement. Is that because there will be a delay before it impacts the bottom line or is there something else going on?
How many 5G antennas you think they'll sell in the next year or two?
"Skyworks has fared much better than QCOM in the past few months. They closed Friday at 189 and average analysts price target is 204 (15 off the targets or 7%). They are near their Feb highs now and have a TTM PE of 30. Compare this to QCOM... and you get the idea that QCOM is due to catch up - PEs in low 20s...price targets at 170 (32 away or 23% from price targets). I believe we see QCOM come back to a more normal valuation soon and likely new price targets will be made after ER for both companies once it is known how hot the 5G market is (mobile, IOT, auto, etc.)."
"This is a very good and must read interview with Amon. He clearly points out the HUGE opportunity beyond hand sets - which they are already delivering on. His priority is 5G and diversifying QCOM. Once QCOM demonstrates ""clearly demonstrates"" they are expanding big time outside of handsets - they become a higher valuation (see NVIDIA). Here is a teaser from the interview:Look what we did in the last two earnings calls. Yes, we have our licensing business, we have our chip business, we have handset revenue . . . but we hit a billion dollars in IoT in the quarter. So that’s the answer. Looking into the future we are going to be executing on this incredible 5G opportunity that we have.

"Chip companies are even less at risk since they are not as vulnerable to consumer boycotts, he said. “There’s limited strategic moves China can do because Qualcomm on 5G is so integral on the smart phones, ” said Ives.“Qualcomm is as integral to the Chinese smart phone market as Tiger Woods is to golf. It’s that intertwined. Micron and Skyworks are also key, especially Micron, but it also speaks to the semi food chain. China needs to handle that with kid gloves, if they went after it, it would have worse implications domestically that would far outweigh the benefits of retaliation..China knows that and that’s why the U.S. knows when it comes to Huawei, that they know that ’s a card they could play,” Ives said."
"SEOUL, Sept. 2 (Korea Bizwire) — LG Uplus Corp., South Korea’s No. 3 mobile carrier, said Tuesday it has formed an alliance with global telecom operators, content developers and U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Technologies Inc. to develop 5G-based augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) content to boost the budding industry.The Global XR Content Telco Alliance will collaborate on developing 5G-based extended reality (XR) content, which covers all immersive content such as AR and VR, according to a statement from LG Uplus.The alliance includes Japan’s KDDI Corp., China Telecom Corp., Bell Canada and Qualcomm, and it will be headed by LG Uplus at launch. Global VR developers such as Canada’s Felix & Paul Studios and France’s Atlas V will also join the alliance as content partners.The cross-border alliance will develop XR content based on Qualcomm’s platform that promises more immersive quality using high-speed 5G networks.The group said it will release a VR series on the International Space Station in November, which will be shot in space and feature a space walk, by working with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."

"DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHEN THE OFFICIAL RULING? DOES IT MATTER? QUALCOME HAS LOTS OTHERS CUSTOMER and everybody push for 5G. One of the reason that AAPL can not sell its new IPHONE X series is because these phones 4G performances are pretty slow as compared to other phones that're using QUALCOM chip! PLUS 5G is US competitive advantage in the technology development so US will have to protect it at any cost! MARK MY WORDS HERE! SAY ONE MORE TIME, TIME TO DOUBLE DOWN ON QUALCOM!"
Hopefully an upgrade will help the stock. IMO shares of QCOM have been heavily manipulated going lower and lower daily from earnings on. Earnings report was decent so why the daily drop in share price every day since??
Just bought more today to accumulate. Average up my cost but this thing is gonna skyrocket (again)
"Even the fiercest critics write, that there will be an appeal court (which should support the stock, as current business practice will continue for an indefinite time frame). After the stay is granted, I believe a settlement between FTC and Q is likely; the panel of judges, analyzing the district courts reasoning reg. monopolistic power, will make it clear to FTC, that settlement is best option for them."

Snapdragon owns the Market, every phone maker is using it, it is the Gold standard.This was a manipulation to move money from QCOM to NVDA, trash one and pump the other. Even if is a lie. To prove my theory, Apple and Cook had to cry uncle, and sign a long term contract, also pay the money it owed QCOM for illegally withholding royalty payments."
"Apple will most likely win the case against Qualcomm. Tim Cook’s argument is simple and powerful. “If I purchase a refrigerator for my home, it’s cost should be independent of the value of my home”. Qualcomm’s attempt to charge for a “refrigerator” based on the cost of the home holds no water. In the process, Qualcomm allowed INTEL to replace it and become Apple’s only modem supplier. While QCOM chips may have higher download speeds, no cell phone company is going to give you that download speed. Eventually the 2 companies will settle."

"The only way Apple can even come close to 5G modem is by hiring away key Qualcomm personnel and picking their knowledge. It's not for nothing they set up shop in San Diego. If Intel IP were sufficiently strong they wouldn't need to do that. This however amounts to stealing intellectual property. I'm sure Qualcomm keeps tabs on everyone who left and went to Apple for modem development. At appropriate time they can unleash legal firepower. Apple already tried legal avenue and failed. Qualcomm never lost either legal or tech contest, and my $$$ is solidly on them."

"Many are ignoring the verbiage that the letter specifically articulated much of the national security concern were classified and those discussed in the letter in details were only the unclassified portion! Which means, we do not know what the real concern is. This tells us that the spooks from the U.S. intelligence community were and are involved in the investigation and that's never a good thing for this current QCOM situation and future AVGO M&A endeavors if the investigation does not go favorable for them. If CFIUS advises against any deal but does not disclose the classified reports, it may put up a perceptual cloud of unknown for AVGO. The interim order requires AVGO to notify CFIUS 5 days prior to their actual re-domicile. Why this requirement was made we do not know. Regardless of whether one likes it or not, the probability of CFIUS killing their own on-going investigation by a mailing address move is low since this move was anticipated and required by CFIUS before they jumped in. It would obviously set terrible precedence for other foreign domiciled companies to follow suit and try to skirt CFIUS scrutiny when preforming US M&A. Time will tell, and daily mud slinging from AVGO is probably not gonna help much, stark contrast to the now muted QCOM PR. Is QCOM under some gag order from the GOV ?"
"Folks lets keep in mine that the ""Chips"" Apple will have to use if they don't give in to QCOM are Intels and Huawei's modem chip sets. It is common knowledge that Intels and Huawei's chip are no match for QCOM's Snapdragon modem chips for 5G.So Apple will try and sell the most expensive phone made with 5G chips that are garbage, that will make their so call ""Flag ship"" phones a third rate below average phone. This is because Tim Cook the supplier ""Squeeze expert"" has a bug up is butt about paying the bargain price for QCOM's chips. He does not know how to win buy vision with great products like his predecessor Steve Jobs. All he can do this Bully suppliers to add to insane profits that Apple makes.This whole law suite situation with Apple should have been thrown out Apple is completely in the wrong!!I hope Cook has to pay out the rear end for money owed to QCOM and penalties for damages.Pun intended for ""COOK""!!!Also this CNBC writters claiming Apple does not need ""Snapdragon"" have rocks in their heads!"

Both companies need to have chips made here in the USA. Taiwan is becoming a place that has to many eggs in one basket.

"The case is entering its final stretch, with closing arguments expects next Tuesday. At this point I believe the FTC’s case is built on theory, while Qualcomm’s defense is grounded in real-world data and market observations. It’s disappointing to see FTC resources wasted on this flimsy case and I hope Judge Koh rules based on real world impacts, not a flawed theory."
"Kind of disappointing volume development, explained by inventory adjustments and Huawei facing headwinds outside China (makes sense logically; Huawei although produced strong figures today, if they are correct). On the positive side: incremental 2 USD per share due to Apple settlement confirmed, lot of design wins, OEMs continue to pay, strong statement that stay will be granted and (only) 1.1 bn shares outstanding end of the year. Apple/Intel seems not to impress. So a mixed bag. The 9th decision will trigger stock development. So another quarter to wait...."

QCOM can take this win and expand it to all the new iphones and across the globe, QCOM can also compound these infringement win and press ITC for ban, time for APPL to come to its senses."
Great job by management. They’ll surely get to over $82/share in their own. LMAO

The Forced Sharing of Tecnology thru Licensing by the Judge will have widespread Ramifications thru Tech Land.
"An observation - Skyworks is trading at around 31TTM... they have about the same growth trajectory and earnings as QCOM... they even both share the around the same div. However, SWKS has around 65% of all its revenue coming from Appple which normally would degrade the valuation. So you have to wonder why are they getting a much higher valuation than QCOM who also owns all the patents? The only thing I can think of is they have a very small amount of outstanding shares compared to QCOM... near 17% of the shares outstanding than QCOM. With more shares, higher manipulation as we all know. Not worried - but thought the observation was worth pointing out. QCOM TTM really needs to be running at 30 and even 40. 30 puts PPS at ~195. It's coming..."
"This insanity can not be explained, so the 10 year Bond goes up one tenth of a percent. Like .01 of% and now high tech stocks are worth less! Give me a break. This is Wall Street at its worst!They claim it makes borrowing of money more for high Tech cost more, most of the these companies have billions of cash on hand. They could go years without borrowing money. What, Apple has close to 100 billion in cash MSFT has billions QCOM has billions!! We need about one million Valium pills for the nut cakes in Wall Street!!"
"This CFIUS delay is (unsurprisingly) nothing more than another stunt concocted by the QCOM board out of desperation to keep their jobs. They know full well the majority of their long-term investors aren't happy and that they were about to lose their seats after tomorrow, had the vote been held. The timing of this delay announcement is just too suspect to believe that QCOM didn't force the hand of CFIUS."

"What’s New: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. today announced real-world test results demonstrating that 5G mmWave connectivity speeds on commercial devices is 16 times faster than 5G operating solely in sub-6 GHz frequencies. These unprecedented results were based on Ookla Speedtest Intelligence data* from user-initiated tests on commercial devices in the United States. 5G mmWave uses ultra-wide channels to deliver exponentially faster speeds and greater capacity compared with lower frequency 4G or 5G bands. 5G mmWave momentum continues through the world, with deployments from all major operators in the U.S. and Japan, recent deployments in Europe and South East Asia, and more coming soon in regions such as Australia and Latin America. China is also expected to deploy 5G mmWave for the Winter Olympics early next year.Why It’s Important: 5G mmWave is critical to dramatically improving the performance and advancing the variety of connected experiences in every setting. This advanced technology delivers massive bandwidth whether you’re at home with 5G fixed wireless access, on-the-go in a train station streaming TV shows, at work or school with a need for enterprise-grade connectivity, or in heavily crowded venues and similar public settings.Qualcomm Technologies made 5G mmWave technology a reality and it is building breakthrough technologies and products to ensure its availability to users. Qualcomm Technologies, along with leaders in the mobile ecosystem, began this work years ago prior to standardization efforts, then moved to interoperability tests in 2017 and 2018, and ultimately commercialized mmWave in 2019 launching multiple flagship smartphones. Last year, the Company showcased 5G mmWave speeds of over 5 Gbps.Qualcomm Technologies is committed to making ultra-fast 5G mmWave connectivity rapidly available to a wide array of users, and have already undertaken multiple initiatives to spread the advanced technology’s footprint, including: • All tiers in the current portfolio of Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Platforms, from 8- to 4-series, are now capable of supporting 5G mmWave • 100+ commercial and pre-commercial 5G mmWave devices according to GSA, including phones, PCs, mobile hotspots, customer premises equipment and modules; Virtually all powered by Snapdragon • Snapdragon-powered 5G phones, including all top flagship devices and models priced as low as $400 • Qualcomm Technologies is enabling mobile operators to deliver Gigabit internet access to many communities using devices based on Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access Platforms, now including extended range 5G with high power mmWave solutions • Radio access networks, such as small cells, are operating today on operator networks using Qualcomm 5G RAN PlatformsThe recently announced Snapdragon X65 Modem-RF System will further extend 5G mmWave with new capabilities such as 10 Gbps peak speeds and mmWave/sub-6 GHZ spectrum aggregation using dual connectivity for further enhanced performance.“Our end-to-end modem to antenna solution brings together all the key 5G breakthroughs to optimize 5G connectivity using the massive bandwidth of mmWave,” said Durga Malladi, senior vice president and general manager, 4G/5G, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “With almost every major OEM offering 5G commercial devices globally, we’re playing a critical role in enabling 5G to live up to its promise of speed and power. This not only redefines the smartphone experience, but also paves the road for endless possibilities, including the further expansion of 5G into fixed wireless access, 5G private networks, compute, XR, and Industrial IoT.”Qualcomm Technologies will further showcase how 5G mmWave is delivering state of the art user experiences during the Qualcomm 5G Summit, May 19-20."
Just bought in for the first time. Good dividend and room for growth with the rollout of 5g. Just need this overblown virus to pass.
"Today, interestingly enough, the 5G stocks are up on a down day. This bodes well for 5G growth/opportunities in coming years getting some much needed love in the coming weeks/months. Maybe Hedges are running out of good growth stories (AI is exhausted, Cloud is taking a break, FAANG out of favor, Everyone hating Amazon lately, etc.). 5G is the shining light on top of the hill with a long runway - 1st inning."
"it is not a coincidence that at the same time the news broke on Apple dumping Qualcomm for Intel that Tan made his ""Final and best offer"" There is some serious colluding between Apple and Broadloom to steal qcom for dirt cheap pricing, just saying ."
qcom will not be affected ..affect is negligible...in one way qcom.becomes monopoly
"Qcom doesn't need APPL!Apple only 28% of the smartphone industry.Love to sell to them, but can live without them"

The biggest ever short squeeze started. It will lift far higher than you thought. GL short sellers! And thanks. :)
"As of today, QCOM is my biggest position. Bought 10 more October $160 options and put in a lowball order to buy 30 of the Jan $150 options on a drop this week."
Why it is so big volatility?
"Although I deign to bring politics into the conversation, I do see an interesting parallel. QCOM is Obama and AVGO is Trump. Although you may not like Trump or his style he is actually getting results and getting good things done. That would parallel AVGO taking QCOM. QCOM, on the other hand, is like Obama, all hope and no results; eight years of pain and suffering hoping for something better. That is QCOM without AVGO, hoping they can find a new strategy (they haven't so far) that might pan out in some distant future."
Sold FB and bought qcom. Get paid and the Nxp deal will happen
QCom offered a Dutch tender for $10B = 148M to 167M shares. At $67.50 148M shares tendered reduces the 1.47B shares outstanding by 10%. This tender will be paid using a quarter of the $40B of cash on hand which currently earns little interest. If 148M shares are tendered the EPS should increase almost 10%. Why would anyone tender a $65 stock for $67.50 I do not know.
"What they are saying: BUY VALUE STOCKS with low forward P/E. What is that value stock?I learned low p/e is for a reason vs high p/e is for a reason. Me, I think this market I stick with what is bringing in the revenues. That will keep bringing in the revenues going forward. They can keep the junk stocks."
One thing I noticed was high call volume at the 117 strike price. Apparently somebody has high hopes for QCOM's advancement!
"7 May, 2021 at 11:17 AMVodafone and Qualcomm jointly developing blueprint for suppliers to build future 5G networks using Open RANDino Flore of QUALCOMM Europe IncVodafone and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. announced plans to join forces to develop the technical blueprint for more equipment suppliers to help build the 5G networks of the future using Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) technology. The move aims to lower the entry barrier for many companies and drive diversification of network equipment vendors."
"This is a great article outlining the future of 5G without Huawei and how it’s opening up the Open radio access network, or O-RAN base station markets to other companies besides Ericsson and Nokia.“””The crackdown on China’s largest technology company has given startups such as Altiostar Networks Inc. and new entrants including Qualcomm Inc. a rare opportunity to grab a slice of the $35 billion the telecom industry spends each year on this crucial part of mobile phone networks.”””As we peel the layers of this onion, the future possibilities of QCOM become clearer and the purpose behind dives like the ones we are seeing are revealed, the street wants our shares, whether you surrender them to them is up to you!The bottom line is QCOM is not just cellphones!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huawei-ban-spurs-competition-ericsson-100000970.html"
the presidents failing this country.
"Engulfing daily yesterday unhealthy. Same for the SPX, DJI, Nasdaq and IWM. On the bright side, down less than all these benchmarks, oil, gas, airlines. We know what that means."
Apple news is total BS. In July 2019 Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel's smartphone modem division. Just how did that workout for QCOM? QCOM doubled since then.
"Hehe, you really believe management responsibility is to manage stock performance??? How? What else are they supposed to say about IOT sales increasing dramatically or cell phone growth with 5G. The market doesn’t care right now and so what is management supposed to do? Do you want them to all of a sudden start announcing mid quarter updates? Or Yeah, “we are going to do X amount of modems and Snapdragons etc.....for 2022”???? They continue to see Qualcomm pretty much as only a chip supplier to cell phone right now, that’s the problem and why they won’t get a forward PE of 20X or greater. It doesn’t matter if they grow 25-30% year over year, they just won’t buy it to that valuation. It sucks, however, it’s not gonna change for at least another year."
"QCOM , rocket to the Stars. can you say 1999."
Where in the world is Don? Doesn't seem like much of a mentor to poor Anon if he keeps disappearing every time he is wrong about QCOM. How do you feel about being abandoned Anon?
I told you guys to just buy it this morning when it was down over 4%. Sometimes you just have to look at the facts and ignore the noise and the scary cats....and have cash for opportunities like this. QCOM headed to over 100 soon...
Pretty quiet here for a 35 year old company hitting ATH. Hope something is cooking for an unprecedented jump on 04 Feb 2021.
I’m gonna get out in front of the next cycle and upgrade QCOM to strong buy since the price of the next downtown (which is at least 12-24 months away) now has been factored in.
looks like yesterday's court judgement is a win-win for QCOM and AAPL.
"Next week , we will see $165 again. Actually, company did really well in the past quarter, Citi has no idea about their downgrading. Be patient."
Forward P/E of 16.25 is lower now than March of 2020.....
"Hedge funds are attacking this to the short side in order to drive price lower so they can buy back in. Same with the Nasdaq futures. Coordinated attacks each night around midnight to 1 AM. Be patient. Once they are happy with the shares they've bought, we start going back the other way."
I don't understand why MMs are always against qcom. SEC should investigate.
qcom should gain at least 10% today with stellar earnings. I don't understand why streets ignore this company. pe is too low like oil companies. Hopefully this can be changed soon with the growth of 5G.
"Well I bought another 178 shares , see y’all at the end of the year good luck to all"
"Watched CEO interview with Yahoo. I do not own Intel but I would be so worry if I have Intel shares. He did not sound very confident when he asked if he can take on $TSM. He was shaking when he asked if he can win $AAPL, $QCOM etc. He was clearly not confident and optimistic. He is from old era. He does not sound like someone can move the company to new era and have new vision. He said he was kicked out Intel 11 years ago LOL, then why they hired him back lol"
Can any one pls explain why they are having a shareholders meeting earlier when all is quashed by the govt. what vote are they talking about
"EU fine on this company is a joke. Apple wants to sign the agreement with QCOM to lock the price with multi-year of supplying chips so won't get shortage and affect Apple Iphones for its demand. Apple now turn around telling the regulators that QCOM discount price to knock out other competitive company like Intel. Who else besides Intel n QCOM the the modem chips? EU is telling the world, you can innovate the pruducts, but you cannot marketing to sell your pruducts. EU, R&D costs tons of money to come out with product; unlike regulators sit their asking for their bonus. Business + politics = corruption simple as that. In this case, Apple uses politics to get what they want. Apple is teaming up with Broadcom so Broadcom later can give Apple better price of the chips (Broadcom is major supplier for Apple). Apple knows QCOM has great products."
It's going to be a rocky road short term with the chip shortage. Buy and hold for long term and you will be rewarded.

CJ Muse is clueless or has ulterior motives. Stay the course on Qualcomm. They are the dominant company on 5G.
Let's enjoy losing money
no way I am letting my shares go at 70
When the hell will this nightmare end ?
Is the DOJ's interference giving Koh a way out? She issued the preliminary judgment and it seems was kinda boxed in. But then apple settled and she was left holding the bag. Maybe the DOJ now gives her an out.

I really do think that by the time Apple gets their act together with 5G the next generation will be coming out rendering 5G as a dinosaur. let's hope so
"Looks like the deal is getting very close the only thing how much Broadcom has to raise to satisfy qcom because they have 33500 employee with no job after the deal done my guess 87 a share will make it happen by this weekend I know it’s just wishful thinking .., I’m happy with 87"
"Xiaomi confirms the Redmi K40 is coming with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, the Redmi K40 will be unveiled in China next month. The device will pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 SoC, coupled with a 4,000mAh battery, and a premium flat display."
"I will buy some more shares. If stock goes down some more again, I'll buy more. This company has a very bright future! :)"
Why did QCOM tried to settle with FTC if they Innocent? Also why don't they just sell the chip but also charge for system level patents separately?
"Boy, that was a short party. Welcome back to reality. "
Hysteric short term market reaction. Qualcomm is the best positioned chip supplier for 5G.
Broadcom will have to give Qualcomm it's best offer before the Dec 15 tender deadline for nxp shares. This is the most straightforward and practical path if Broadcom wants Qualcomm.
"stay, trade resolution, huawei settlement and sales resumption, QCOM at $89Youve been warned :)"
"This will be absolutely phenomenal next week, Folks. Let's go."
DEAL IS TERMINATED at the end of the day. Just announced by the CEO in the earnings call.
Good day!!
"This drop today had nothing to do with the Apple rehash news, but rather the TSM news that April revenue was down 13.8% compares to last month, up 16% compares to last year."
"you read it here first, april 2018 , qcom 75.00 per share"
"It's hard to hide the fact that ALL semis are doing very well. AMAT CEO said he has orders for the next decade. QCOM announced Mega progress with Open RAN - multiple chips - and just this morning the new 315 5G which will be sold into solutions for factories, agriculture, and anywhere there are robots. The future communication technology is here and its driving huge demand for Chips. Hold onto your shares."
what % of profit is from aapl?
"Lots of pure speculation here,...guessing the stock price outcome because you want it to be more than it is...just pure wishful thinking so calm down and realize there is no magic just sales and earnings and hard core reality that QCOM is not a high flyer dreamer stock but almost a utility stock with added juice to it. Just buy and hold and relish and reinvest the dividends for the next 20 years, ok? Long term holders will do just fine."
"Couple things to point out here. NVIDIA/AMD/TSM all down probably in sympathy with TSM on Intel news. Yet again big nothing burger for years to come, but gives traders reason for volatility and shake shares loose, etc. QCOM volume low and nothing to be concerned about... this will languish here up or down a few points with the market until an event happens. When it does, you will know it and it will quickly move up to old levels and above. What is that event? Longest to wait is ER at which point they will probably say chip shortage looking better and seeing stronger 2nd half, etc."
"oh thank God, up in AH"
"This is old news for Qualcom - Apple bought intel modem division and everyone knew they were going to try and develop their own modems. You think qualcom is just sitting back. They are so far ahead in this game. Intel gave up and everyone thinks apple is just going to show up and dominate everything. The modem market is going to expand very rapidly with all of the devices (IOT), and cars being part of the 5G revolution. Wouldn't be bothered one bit with Apple. Forgotten news shortly as we move forward."
Many analysts will raise Qcom’s price target to over $100
"Some bad news for China is good news for the USA and QCOM...Tsinghua Unigroup Co., a key player in China’s push for self-reliance in semiconductors, is in default on nearly $2.5 billion of international bonds, in the latest instance of financial stress in China spilling over into global markets.Late Wednesday, a unit of the company said it expected not to repay principal or the last chunk of interest on $450 million of bonds due Thursday. A separate filing said that would trigger cross-defaults on a further $2 billion in dollar bonds—three issues, coming due between 2021 and 2028.On ward to going Belly up!!"
AVGO is getting desperate with trying to take control of the board. What it indicates to me is it has no intention to significantly raise its bid. Soon they will go away.
More downgrade coming soon
My guess is there will be a one-time dividend announced on May 1 ..... a special way to help fend off B/O suitors and also recognize their loyal supporters on the march to $100.00 !!!

CRNT Ceragon management reports book to bill better than 1 for March. Sees 5g ramping up sooner and better results in 2nd half 2020.Ceragon does back haul equipment for 5g.

"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4258734 The guidance for non GAAP 3rd quarter is very very conservative: Page 4 Q is saying, revenue is to be 5.5 bn $ in 3rd quarter. Page 5 Q says, Revenue for QCL (licensing) to be 1.325 bn $, This leaves 4.175 bn $ revenue for QCT. EBT margin for 3rd quarter: 15% QCT, 70% QCL. Taking these numbers, I come to EBT of 626 m and 928 m totaling 1.554 bn $. With outstanding shares at 1.2 bn, this gives 1.3$ EPS for 3rd quarter. The 3rd quarter 2017, EPS have been 0.83$ ( I took 3rd Q 2017 being without the legal issues with Apple). Using the percentage of increase 3rd quarter 2019 (my assumption) to 3rd quarter 2017 actual and apply it to 4th quarter 2019, I calculate 1.44$ for 4th Quarter 2019. Total 2019 would end with 4.71 $ non GAAP EPS. For 2020, incl. 1.50 additional EPS for incremental Apple business (total effect of Apple 2USD, thereof 0.50 already realized in 2019) I come to 6.2 $ EPS for 2020 without Huawei settlement, without additional RF business etc. Think Q plays it very conservative in the moment."
"Apple under Timmie Cook is a very different company these days. It has a penchant for stealing other people's IPR, tax evasion, using child labor and treating her suppliers like indentured slaves. She also thinks an app that mimics a users facial gestures adds more value to the phone than does the incredibly complicated wireless voice, data and internet access capabilities. I would not be surprised if mean ol Apple was backing Broadcom in it's take over attempt of Qualcomm. Yep, she a mean ol bag these days, kinda like her CEO. If it weren't for Qualcomm, the iPhone X would be little more than an iPod in search of a wifi connection. And ya wouldn't be paying $1,000 bucks for one of those. Trust me."

"question...when Intel puts their modem in apple products are those done without Qcom patented tech or chips etc? specifically is Qcom tech fee accrued when the hardware is manufactured elsewhere? when tsmc or Samsung produces chips via qcom tech patents, they pay a royalty, so why is apple able to attempt tobavoid this? never really understood this argument. I mean if a company isn't buying the chips but wants the tech a toll is collected. if that company buys directly from manufactuer than they pay for both the hardware and the tech. 2 separate fees for 2 separate items. how else would there be any guarantee of revenue for creating the technology."
We are going to be in the 147 -150 trading range I think until next Friday. A huge load of options will be expiring with a strike price of 150. So a week from Monday I believe we can start seeing appreciation of above 150 and beyond.
"why would anyone want to do business with apple. schizoid, back stabbing sons of bit----. wasn't it part of their settlement that they would use Qualcomm's modem? I guess they don't feel they need to abide by their settlement. they'll screw anyone including their customers. well they couldn't get a chip/modem to actually work in the past, so there is no reason to believe that they have anything that works now."
"This is the problem with short sellers...it's not about needing them to equalize markets when things get overvalued. IMO, it's a manipulation by them to make money by taking shares of decent companies down just because they can. It's b.s. and it should be illegal."
I see Bloomberg and their market maker buddy Susquehanna out with fear porn on chip shortages tonight. Must need supply before the next run up.
"Look!I told you folks a week ago that I owned QCOM in 1998 and sold it in the low 60s. 20 years later and nothing.This has nothing to do with the product.This has to do with the Jacobs.They care nothing about shareholders, only themselves.Their wealth is staggering, but still want more.If they cared about you, they would have engaged Broadcomm in the beginning.I'm not saying they should have sold right away or sold at all, but they pulled a fast one on you shareholders with the Gov. intervention.This one is going back to the low 50s."
I’m so sad :( lost a lot of money betting on earnings. Thankfully I only put 1000$ so I can recover with my long shares. But man next time remember not to bet on earnings especially for large cap companies.

"iPAD Pro with 5G and (big margin) MM Wave. Thanks Apple. Chip Shortage abating per multiple reports including Amon. QCOM expecting 1B 5G phones and only just began. $1B in 5G IOT in one quarter - growing and diversifying. Apple not with their own chip for 3 years and then will need to license and buy QCOM high end anyway. $8B in pipeline for Auto. PEG under 1. Future PE under 20. Per Amon full guidance in the bag - only upside left. Smart City using 5G. Low latency factories. 5G IP portfolio MOAT. (I could keep typing, but I think you get the idea - hold on to your shares.

Deja Vu all over again!! Looks Apples Cook is playing his games about their own 5G modem chip. We have been there and done that!There is no way Apple has turned around a viable top rated 5G chip in less than a year. They bought Intel’s division that was working on a Millmeter wave 5G chips. Intel failed to come up with this kind of chip. Now Cook is rocking the boat and claiming Apple will have a workable 5G chip by 2023. We all know this is a pipe dream. This will end with more egg on his face. Also when 2023 comes around QCOM will be 2 years ahead of Apple again! Some people like having an Ax to grind! Give it up!!

AAPL should settle with QCOM and work with QCOM on 5G etc. to survive!
"This I will tell U. Historically, selling qcom in panic is always a mistake. I know - I did so 3 times over the years. Hey, I was in qcom before most of U. Based on George Gilder's newsletter, I invested $13,000 in qcom - when no one ever heard of qcom. I rode it up to $320,000 - then rode it back down in the great tech bubble of 2003. Even so, qcom survived and emerged as the leading wireless tech company. Despite all the criticism and naysayers, it seems to me this is still an important wireless tech company. Based on my experience - qcom survives all the woes it faces."

"It all looks perfect for the 9th Circuit to do what is normally impossible: make everyone happy. Apple has settled, most likely for technical reasons. As a result, Intel is leaving the segment. If 9th is correcting district courts order, Q can continue to invest in R&D, shareholders would jump for joy anyhow (like me). The reputation of 9th would be polished. Everybody happy, apart from Judge Koh. Why did she order in such a rude way against Q? Apple settlement did happen after the Jan trial. Huawei discussions started after Jan trial. So some parameters have changed since her decision. Hopefully the judges from 9th will use the opportunity, at least to ease a settlement between FTC and Q. Interesting weeks to come !!!!"
"Sold my Jan 2021 $60.00 calls for a loss today. Scared the heck out of me when the CFO departed.

"Qcom will blow it out this quarter! with a new phone cycle, 5G implementation, and other catalysts, expect to see Qualcomm over $200 in the near future!"
"Interesting that a low level analyst puts out a story today that Apple will stop using their chips, manipulation much?"
"It turns out that AAPL is definitely at the back of the line when it comes to being supplied with the mobile 710 Snapdragon chip. The Fly points out to coming disruptions in leadership with those being supplied for the 5g future (Chinese companies) moving ahead, and those not being supplied (AAPL) falling behind. No wonder AAPL fought to put QCOM in the cheap seats. Now AAPL must pay the piper."

"This was a classic how to arm your enemies with a weapon to beat your brains out. A mere one tenth of one percent mistake when earnings were reportedAll they did is give the naysayers a big stick to hammer QCOM by saying they missed on Revenue.

"Because of the freeze on the economy, on the other side, the USA will have to move exponentially much faster including the demand for communication which in my view set 5G to be scale-up faster than predicted.

I think QCOM goes higher from here. Good RSI and good 20 day and 50 day moving averages. Any thoughts?
what was that flush late in the day?? trading is kinda weird w/ this stock recently.
I am sure we will be rosy in 2nd half this year. lots of good progress are happening in qualcomm business expansion and chip shortage issue will get resolved or mitigated gradually.
I even found a vote-white ad from Qualcomm in my Facebook feed. The board of directors is certainly doing a good job spending shareholder money trying to save their own jobs. Hopefully it won't work.
"There are few interesting timeline for QCOM + AVGO merger:1) 12-8-17 deadline for board of director nominations for QCOM, from CNBC news feed, it seems AVGO CEO wants to nominate people to have the entire QCOM board members replaced.2) 3-6-2018 we (share holders) get to vote on the nominations.If I read correctly AVGO will probably offer the 2nd bid for QCOM between 12-8-2017 to 3-6-2018 to have institutional investors to be voting on their side. Institutional holdings are about 78% for QCOM, info from Nasdaq.com.Good luck longs!"
Did not upgrade my iPhone this round. Reason: waiting for 5G.
"Apple paid only 5 Bn to Qcom and its capital got increased to 40Bn...please think this would go down to $65 with the settlement news. Max is $65, this is my neutral analysis."

The only way for the U.S. to win the wireless war against China is for it to find a way to reduce Qualcomm’s reliance on China. Why don’t we have a domestic industry outside of Apple that produces Android based phones? Why is Apple allowed to skirt payments for Qcom’s technology? Until these issues are resolved Qualcomm will remain dependent on China and thus handcuff the U.S. in it’s attempt to win the wireless war against China.
if you believe this company can approach INTC and NVDA valuations then $175-250 is the target range

AAPL is betting on the FTC to hand them QCOM patents on a silver platter, but if they settle, AAPL will be forced to settle with QCOM."

"Minus 6% and heavy volume ?? Is Apple's own chip such a big impact ? Wondering why Qcom is not giving any statement either ? The volume both yesterday and today is so high. R they shorting or selling ! And the dam news article is so manipulative saying they just started development with no indication of timelines or relation to the 6 year agreement. if this is such a minus to Qcom, should have a big+ for Apple i guess. Cant understand these dam over reactions ! unless this is a serious impact."

"QCOM News cycle is getting more active.Qualcomm’s new robotics development platform is 5G-enabled Qualcomm this morning just announced the latest version of its robotics development platform. The chipmaking giant is skipping a number, following up last year’s RB3 platform with the Robotics RB5 — which seems to signify, among other things, the key embrace of 5G connectivity this time out. The next-generation wireless technology has been seen as a key enabler of Internet of Things products and robotics alike, bringing a new level of high speed wireless across a broad spectrum of connected devices. No wonder, then, that Qualcomm is pushing hard here. The system also supports 4G, just in case. Qualcomm is one of a number of operators looking to get in on the ground level of third-party robotics development. Perhaps most notable among the company’s competition is NVIDIA’s ISAAC platform. But Qualcomm certainly has a lot going for it from the standpoint of components, with a depth of knowledge in connectivity, processing power and AI. It also has a number of high-profile partners already developing for the new platform, including Intel, Panasonic, AirMap, SLAMCORE and ROS gatekeepers, Open Robotics. The system will support a number of third-party components, including Intel’s RealSense depth camera and Panasonic’s TOF (time-of-flight) camera. There are currently more than 20 early adopters to the new platform, with the first commercial products expected to be released before the end of the year."
"So as I'm sitting here on a bleak Sunday morning looking out at the freezing rain mix and wondering what the earnings call in February might bring, I started thinking about all the new phones that we are now seeing daily in little press releases or news articles announcing their launches with the Snapdragon chips, so if they are already launched like some, or have pending launches, those chips sales IMHO should be showing up on this next earnings call (depending how they record the sales) since they would have had to be in the hands of the manufacturers sometime ago to go through the assembly processes.So my rationale is that this next earnings call may just bring a larger earnings surprise then the last one (I pray that I am right) LOL :-)A quick G search of the text... launch phone with the Snapdragon, in the news section and restricting the time window to one week, returned 12 pages of hits. Now I'm sure there are duplications from different outlets, but my rationale and hope is that there are a LOT of other cell phone manufacturers, (remember several months ago when Steve Mollenkopf stated they had from Equipment OEM's, 110 licensing agreements in hand at that time) so my suspicion is...we all know about the Samsung, Apple. Google etc. phones, but what about all the places and companies around the world that we are not factoring in because we may have never heard about them, well a search for that indicated around 180 manufacturers, granted they will not all be going to 5G, BUT MAYBE SOMEDAY!!! Are any of us factoring the potential of any of these other OEM's launching and their purchasesshowing up on this next CC on 2/3/21?Of course, I am hoping I am right, because this will either lead to a short squeeze after the call, or a possible runup to the previous high's before the call in anticipation of what I've indicated here, because the professionals that short, are not stupid.Here's the search link I used...https://www.google.com/search?q=launch+phone+with+the+Snapdragon&tbs=qdr:w&tbm=nws&sxsrf=ALeKk01srFOHX8ktPmY5cQ0aY8U18UOvbg:1609687454765&ei=nuHxX-SpLqOd5wLZxZ6YAQ&start=0&sa=N&ved=0ahUKEwjk8MKHiYDuAhWjzlkKHdmiBxM4ChDy0wMIhgE&biw=1920&bih=832&dpr=1GLTA"

"Next week theres a call with US and China to start discussing phase 2 of deal. The US doesn't agree with.everything China does but must play nice in the sandbox with them, as US companies understand the importance of diversifying their manufacturing. Great news for Qcom!!!"
This is why QCOM is universally known as the serial disappointer.
congratulations folks especially to long term holders..memorable week and dont forget to buy for others as tomorrow is good friday and no trading
Another hedge fund funded Bloomberg hit job to try to get QCOM down to their buy point.
2023 - lol - Apple will be behind the eight ba... - scrap that - 6G ball.
Yesterday's news wasn't some profit beat. It may of shifted the power of big tech for a generation. That's why we're getting back to back 10%+ gains at this cap. When was the last time this happened?
they will get the Huawei deal now
Shouldn't a global chip shortage lead to increased pricing power?
QCOM's current pullback is a gift right here and right now and should be bought with conviction.
"Lets assume that CFIUS closes the investigation and does not stop the deal. Lets further assume that the NXPI deal is dead. Now then, if AVGO proceeds with a purchase price in the $82-$91 range, is there any remaining opposition?"

news of NXP deal approval will pressure broadcom to do better. hock tan better wake up
DEALREPORTER: QCOM UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO SCHEDULE MOFCOM MEETINGS.There you have it. NXPI acquisition is toast. The end. That’s the reason why NXPI is tanking. I guess we have to open our wallets again and pay the NXPI shareholders $2 billion.
Forecasting a 100% increase in earnings for next quarter. Let that soak in.
"For those of you who are voting white because you think it will give Qualcomm more leverage to negotiate the price up with Broadcom, that is likely not going to happen. “Mr. Tan essentially signaled that Broadcom would seek fewer board seats in an interview on CNBC on Monday.“If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen,” he said. “We will walk.”He flat out said they will walk from the deal on CNBC, pretty strong words."
There is a positive news between China and Us in chip industry. Will that give a bull to qcom?
"With all the positive attention 5G has been receiving I would have expected QCOM to be testing its high (94) by now. Of course investors are surely concerned about QCOM's ""favorite"" judge threatening to drop the hammer on them."
who keeps selling at these levels????
"I thought i read that companies can petition to sell to huawei. Perhaps I'm being naive, but my understanding is we're very concerned w/ their equipment installed here in the states. Why would it be a security risk if they bought from qcom? And wouldn't any licensing deals be unrelated to this mess?"
"Qualcomm employees will receive a nice severance package after Christmas. Qualcomm following leads from GE and Wells Fargo in early 2019 to cut cost and improve the outlook. Qualcomm announced that its Board of Directors approved a $16 billion accelerated stock repurchase agreement as part of a $30 billion stock repurchase program announced in July. “We remain on track to complete a large majority of the announced program by the end of fiscal 2019,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf. “The Board and the management team remain committed to returning capital to stockholders while we also continue to invest to create longer term stockholder value.” The repurchase will be funded by existing cash resources.Furthermore, Qualcomm has been embroiled in antitrust lawsuits in the past couple of years and has had to pay billion-dollar fines, and its NXP acquisition was cancelled, which forced the company to cut another $1 billion dollar in costs and lay off 1,200 employees.Qualcomm continues to shed workers in San Diego and elsewhere as part of a pledge to shave $1 billion in annual costs: 269 jobs in California and North Carolina. It disclosed the layoffs in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notices filed with the employment agencies in both states. At its San Diego headquarters, Qualcomm is letting go 125 workers. In North Carolina, 144 workers are losing their jobs. Layoffs take effect in early February.Qualcomm has all but eliminated its server chip division, cutting its workforce from about 1,000 employees earlier this year to only 50. The division was in charge of building the 48-core Centriq 2400 processor, which Qualcomm launched in 2017 on the 10nm process.Chinese Joint Venture Will Build Qualcomm’s Centriq Chip. Qualcomm’s Centriq IP will continue to live under the Thang Long 4800 brand name used by HXT, a joint venture set up between the Chinese Guizhou Province and Qualcomm, with 55 percent of the joint venture owned by the Guizhou Province.The Thang Long 4800 seems to be almost identical to the Centriq 2400, with one exception. The chip uses a different encryption module that aims to comply with China’s encryption regulations, June 19, 2018, Qualcomm is laying off 1,231 San Diego employees and another 269 workers in Northern California as part of a $1 billion cost- cutting plan.Qualcomm's cost-cutting plan was part of an effort to prevent a hostile takeover by rival Broadcom. The Trump administration blocked Broadcom's buyout, but lagging stock prices and poor financial performance have left investors worried."
"Qualcomm completes NUVIA acquisition, will release high-performance ultrabook processors in 2022NUVIA's CPU technology will be integrated in many upcoming Qualcomm products, including ultraportable laptop processors, smartphone chips, digital cockpits, AI-assisted driving, extended reality and infrastructure networking solutions."
"Actually here’s the latest ...they must have a real demand problem Qualcomm has been gearing up to seek multiple supply sources for both silicon-based and III-V semiconductors amid increasingly tight capacity at the global IC value chain, and reportedly will install one vice president working exclusively to cement support from production partners in Taiwan, according to industry sources. #capacity #GaAs #ICmanufacturing #Qualcomm #Taiwan"
I’m confused by the FTC’s comment that Qualcomms chips don’t compete on the merits. He says that OEM’s are forced to pay exorbitant licensing fees to get access to Qualcomm’s chips in “Monopoly Markets”. So if Qualcomm isn’t competing on the merits how is it that their the only one with a chipset that OEM’s want to purchase? FTC’s arguments are very disruptive. They misdirect and confuse with the goal of making their argument believable.

"OK, here are my thoughts on the Quarter ER coming up. The Analysts after the ER all (except for CJ & CITI which don't count) confirmed or raised guidance on QCOM. This was pretty significant considering the chip shortage and very slight miss on top line. This was a vote of confidence to the new CEO which speaks to his credibility. They were saying we have your back, don't screw us. Targets average out to ~170 for pps. Now this ER is Amon's test. As the brand new CEO, he really needs to keep the trust of the analysts and investors. If, after he said they can make their guided numbers even with chip shortage, they don't meet both bottom and top? That is very bad for Amon and don't think he doesn't know that. I don't expect he will let that happen and likely why Q2 forecast seemed a tad light. Ideally, AMON will come out with guns blazing here - guide higher and meet and exceed Q2 to establish his credibility. All (and I mean all) market indicators point to a very good quarter for QCOM (TSM, 5G sales, MU, AVGO etc.) We will see."

Either way QCOM shares should take off even if share price drops more it will rebound stronger. So I picked up more QCOM shares this morning on weakness.
"From Seeking AlphaQualcomm: Huge Growth Approaches Qualcomm has experienced years of bad luck and setbacks that appear to be coming to an end. After the coronavirus slowdown is complete, wireless 5G acceptance and product growth should propel results far into the future. Qualcomm can be purchased at cheaper than historical valuations, heading into well-above normal operating growth. High profit margins, a conservative balance sheet, a large share buyback leveraging upside, and a solid dividend story are worth consideration. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been busy since 2017, getting its future arranged for faster growth rates. Finally, after years of setbacks and obstacles, Wall Street is expecting a sharp jump in Qualcomm EPS into 2021-22. The owner/manufacturer of many of the patents and semiconductors that make wireless communication possible, Qualcomm is a critical player in the world’s information-technology economy. For long-term stockholders, patience may yet prove a virtue! It took several years of fifth-generation (5G) chip research & development for the newest wireless industry standard to become reality. The company spent hundreds of millions in legal fees fending off the Apple (AAPL) licensing and patent disputes between 2017-19. Plus, Qualcomm had to deal with its failed takeover attempt of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) during 2018. All told, today’s $89 price is not much different than its 2014 high quote around $80. Last but not least, the string of bad luck has been capped by the coronavirus economic shutdown and supply chain problems of 2020, estimated to dent June Q3 sales by 20-30%. After the NXP Semiconductors merger fell apart (an effort to expand and diversify away from its cell phone and smartphone chip and license focus), the company has done an admirable job of redeploying its cash hoard into a monster share buyback. The company has been able to repurchase 25% of its outstanding shares since the end of 2015, with a sizable chunk of it acquired last year. The good news is the balance sheet remains quite strong and liquid after the buyback, while leveraging future operating results for the remaining owners. Qualcomm has refocused its preparation for the new 5G wireless growth wave that began deployment in 2019. This back-to-basics approach should help the stock price to much stronger performance soon. Just last week, Qualcomm announced a new processor, the Snapdragon 690 CPU chip for cheaper sub-$500 smartphones (a consumer price-point representing 50% of global phone sales) geared toward 5G network access. Are you wondering what all the fuss over 5G is about? For perspective, experts believe the speed of 5G may encourage customers to use phone access as a replacement for cable TV subscriptions. If 5G does revolutionize wireless communication and internet access, Qualcomm’s piece of the pie could turn into an income bonanza! Settling all disputes with Apple was a huge win for the company, as sales/income trends from one of its largest customers will remain intact. Intel’s subsequent withdrawal from the immediate 5G chip market was also a positive, reducing competitive pressure, at least for a number of years. In the end, once the coronavirus economic mess becomes less intrusive to operations and demand sometime in 2021, the final weight holding Qualcomm in check will be removed. Wall Street analysts agree with this view. 2021-22 should usher in a dramatically stronger profit picture. And, the increase in earnings will be divided between fewer owners, after the large share buyback. Below you can see the unusual bump higher expected in EPS, especially against other available equities for your investment capital in the U.S. Estimates are calling for cash income to nearly double from $3.45 in fiscal 2020 to $6.23 per share by 2022-23. Analyst estimates collected by Yardeni Research are only looking for 2022 S&P 500 earnings to make it back to 2019's pre-recession level. On a relative basis, Qualcomm’s 75-90% surge above last year would be a standout winner."

"I'm not say history repeats itself, but, we had a steady rise in April up to about 57 and just two days before the big jump to 76 it was driven down to about 54 or about 5% and then it jumped on Apple news. Until they say QCOM is bankrupt I think I'll stay with 5G."

But what will be ITC’s basis for next weeks decision ? If somebody could tell me...."
"If QCOM ends up with NXPI, then AAPL will make a run at the combined entity. AVGO will go back into the woodwork where they belong. AVGO's heart isn't really into this deal."

"More than likely a stay will be issued during the next few days. That stay will be in place for a very long time (years) during the appeals process. Qcom will continue with business as usual during the appeals process and eventually reach a (likely favorable) settlement with FTC. The DOJ is already on Qcom's side and Qcom already settled with Apple. They will come to a settlement with the FTC. Ultimately, this ruling should have a negligible effect on Qcom's future."
"“We delivered an exceptional quarter, more than doubling earnings year-over-year due to strong 5Gdemand in handsets and growth in our RF front-end, automotive and IoT adjacencies, which drove recordearnings in our chip business,” said Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated. “We remainwell positioned as the 5G ramp continues and we extend our core technology roadmap to adjacentindustries.”"

I hope the SEC would be interested in looking into today Q's trading activity by Kerrisdale Capital before and after their announcement and who's trading what. Very suspicious trading movement.
"So the way I look at it, after one year of initial decisions, review of initial decisions and new initial decisions, ITC managed successfully, not to be involved. The final final ruling of both yesterdays’ decisions will be in July. Which is quite practical, as until July, other decisions will have taken place to make whatever ITC decision irrelevant. So far, we still don’t know, if patents have been infringed, about consequences of that like import ban and the role of public interest. So this leaves it to the April Court Case, where a jury has to decide. Almost forgotten: Judge Koh on the FTC case. So what she will do now? She preliminary ruled, that Q should go for component licensing. 2 month later, a Texas court ruled the opposite. Whilst FTC was saying, that Q’s prices are too high, in San Diego the jury ordered a price of 1.41$ fir just 3 patents. And during the FTC trial, Apple said, they have been forced into an exclusitivity contract, whilst Q said it was Apple who insisted on 1 bn rebate ( everybody who is in business for a year may know, who has the stronger hand in this negotiations). So what will Judge Koh do now? Maybe it’s the best to leave all decisions to the jury in April. It seems, that jurors, who have accepted their nominations, are the ones who take their job serious and come up with a decision. Well, it will be appealed anyhow...."

"With so many complicated cases going on, who knew we would have to be legal experts to invest. One thing I know though is it’s a dirty move, whether qcom wins this or Apple, to know you owe royalties but not pay them when you are still using another company’s ip to sell your products. Even if you feel you are overpaying, let the courts decide that, but pay something, even if it’s just what you believe you should have to pay. But what kind of move is this to not pay when you know you should."

"TSMC Results, they beat the street and guide higher, this bodes well for QCOM. The world's largest chip foundry earned 78 cents per American depositary receipt on sales of $10.38 billion in the June quarter. Analysts expected Taiwan Semiconductor earnings of 71 cents a share on sales of $10.35 billion. In the year-earlier period, it earned 41 cents per U.S. share on sales of $7.75 billion. ""Our second-quarter business was sequentially flat, as the continued 5G infrastructure deployment and (high-performance computing) product launches offset weaknesses in other platforms,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said in a news release. He added, ""Moving into third quarter 2020, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer technologies, driven by 5G smartphones, HPC and (Internet of Things) applications."" Circuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter. Taiwan Semiconductor is leading the race to make chips at smaller process nodes. Smaller circuits translate to faster, more power-efficient processors. Its customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM) and more. Taiwan Semiconductor Guides Higher For Q3For the September quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor expects revenue of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion. The midpoint of $11.35 billion is higher than Wall Street's target of $10.71 billion. In the third quarter last year, Taiwan Semiconductor generated sales of $9.4 billion. In pre-market trading on the stock market today, TSM stock rose 0.4%, near 66.35. TSM stock notched a record high of 67.21 in intraday trading on Wednesday."
"Folks the long term strength in last weeks events, paints a picture that can not be ignored.When you take time to read and understand all the positive implications of what happen last week with Apple and QCOM it shows a very clear picture of a long term higher stock price for QCOM.. I'm talking about years not weeks or months. Trust me in the last 3 months I have sold about 5 stocks on big gains that have popped for just a day or two. Most of them on good earnings, but I took my profits and ran, all of them have since held or gave back part of the gains.I know that much of this was just plain luck, I have been humbled many times by the stock market. I have learned what events that have lasting power for the stock price to keep climbing.Right now to me, it looks like all the Planets are lined up for QCOM going forward. Good luck to all the folks that see this and HOLD their shares, and good luck to the short termers who sold; but I hope the Shorts burn for ever!!!Regards to all; the joe with a small ""j"" ...Please review all positive growth potential we now have in QCOM"
"Kingspellchecker, as suspected, great numbers and it’s up very little to what it should be. Only thing that concerns me going forward is a market correction with respect to where it is by next earnings. I would think it’s at $160 but who knows."
"From MU conference call...5G handset volumes could grow to approximately 500 million units in 2021, from around 200 million units in calendar 2020, and these 5G products feature higher memory and storage content to enable enhanced consumer experiences."
"Ways Qcom will grow EPS more than just $2 per share from Apple:1. Reduced legal fees will increase profits. Also other costs because of disputes; such as cost of firing 3 CFO/Directors, espcial R&D for 5G chips and etc. In 2018 special itens expenses on The balance sheet was $3.4 Billion (yes billion) this should go back to zero or even positive as it was in 2016 before Apple lawsuits started.2. More than 30 contracts were signed at CES in January, this will only show at earnings on May 1st. Most of them are for 5G chips for phones and cars.3. With the $6 billion it receive from Apple Qcom will do more buybacks reducing the float by about 6.5%.4. New audio chips for voice control for earphones and smart speakers, completly new segment for Qcom.5. Artificial Inteligence chips for data processors. Another new segment for Qcom.6. Uncertanty risk off the table and Apple deal will allow for renogotiate existing debt, less interest it pays, larger EPS."
"Now that the tax bill will be law, QCOM has to pay 15% tax on their cash holdings overseas, about $29 Billion which they had planned to use on NXPI purchase tax free. It will be interesting to see how this affects their thinking regarding an increase in their NXPI price/sh offering."
More hits to come. Beginning of the 5G rollout cycle. Can u say 180 -200 bucks. By Christmas.
"I see no news on Tim Cook deposition. What gives? Postponed? Settlement????? haha. would love the latter. But seriously, odd there's nothing out there. Shouldn't this have been a fairly big story?"
"Qualcomm won another chance Wednesday to try and avoid facing a class of cellphone buyers estimated at 250 million people, thanks to a Ninth Circuit decision granting immediate appeal to Judge Koh's granting of class cert in an antitrust case."
Stock is going to fly on Monday!!! Then Judge Koh will short it and then deny the appeal and she'll clean house!
Qcom is still very cheap. 5G will rule and QCOM will rule over 5G. See you at $150
"The QCOM press department is working overtime today!!!Verizon, Ericsson and Qualcomm first in the world to achieve 5G peak speed of 5.06 Gbps – Companies continue driving advancements in 5G technology using carrier aggregation technology on mmWave spectrum – SAN DIEGO – October 20, 2020 – On the heels of Verizon’s news last week about advancing both the deployment of 5G and innovations in the technology, Verizon, Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. have teamed up to continue driving development forward by being the first in the world to demonstrate 5G peak speeds of 5.06 Gbps. Using 5G mmWave spectrum with carrier aggregation, a technology that combines multiple channels of spectrum to provide greater efficiency for data sessions transmitting over the wireless network, the companies combined eight separate channels of spectrum to achieve the multi-gigabit speeds."
Almost 1.8 mil deep in money call options were bought today for June 21...big news coming
"Here is thought, for those blue dudes who sold today causing the stock to tank, do their vote still count ? That would be a bit odd right ?"
let's buy LYG (Lloyds Bank). It's going up.
question: how does qiqi making modem antenna affect qcom?
"Apple's responses to the Chinese court loss reflect its absolute refusal to settle the QCOM litigation.This despite the growing list of adverse consequences Apple is facing because of its stance.Despite Apple's unwillingness to settle, we all know that QCOM has outwardly signaled its desireto settle everything. What is it going to take to get Apple to the settlement table?"
No easy money on wallstreet
QCOM gets authorization for NXPI. So does the deal get done now or do they walk away because of price?
i bought in today at bottom ....can I win for a change?
"Doh...(second head slap)..why didn't I buy more QCOM back when the div yield touched 5%?! That's in ute/telecom land, with higher DGR, much lower payout ratio, higher financials rating, and a long track record.. Doh-doh"
Today’s closing price eclipsed the $82 per share that chip rival Broadcom offered as part of its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm in late 2017 and early 2018. Broadcom’s effort was thwarted by the Trump administration over national security concerns.And softbank investor sunk billions into WeWork instead of hostile takeover of QCom with Junior Jacobs.Brilliant strategy put forth by Q C-Suite and Directors. Can’t wait for FTC appeal to be won. CU at march shareholder mtg longs!
Qcom is like a bank only giving us 4% return on Our money never moves.. this should be in 90’s now!!!
"So, US, China and Germany gave verdicts that Apple has infringed upon QCOM IP. And importantly each court gave their verdict on unique set of patents. Apple is basically in violation of infringing (as found by courts) on not only these 3 patents but much more than that.Meanwhile, Taiwan, China and Japan gave clean verdict (no monopoly) on the licensing business.Up next is Korea and US FTC."
"AVGO doesn't want to be acquired, so it has to raise the bid for QCOM to fend offer INTC (Does that look familiar?)."
Tonight...
"Just read any Q patent and you will realise the power of Q patent portfolio. Very clear and presice. Claims are accurate and reasonably broad. It just have no weak patents. Recently, the European Patent Office recognized Q contribution to technology by awarding Dr. Marta Karczewicz (one of the Q main contributor to the technology and author of Q patents) the LIFETIME ACHIEVMENT AWARD https://www.epo.org/learning-events/european-inventor/finalists/2019.html"
Perfect. Now we all get to file amended tax forms as QCOM mischaracterized the December dividends as return of capital instead of as qualified dividends.
"Hey Tim Apple don't be late to the 5G party - Samsung Electronics Poised to Dominate 5G Smartphone Market in Apple’s Absence""... It is difficult for Apple to receive 5G modem chips properly because of a dispute with Qualcomm.""http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=30618"
Complete garbage sell off. Same price as in October 2020 after the revenues and outlook has improved by miles since then.
"Think. QCOM did not request a national security review from CFIUS; they merely requested a review of the proposed new directors, probably as a hope to get one or more directors disqualified as an insurance policy in case they lost the vote. Treasury expanded the review while it was underway.If QCOM had not made that request, as of today, barring a disqualification, the BoD would have six new directors, the NXPI deal would not have been extended, and the $82 AVGO bid would have likely been accepted. The share price would likely be $78-$80. The CFIUS investigation would still have occurred, but in the normal way as part of vetting the deal.Those that want to put their hopes in CFIUS nuking the deal and QCOM getting to some mystical price sometime in the far future, could still do so. Those that want to see real, immediate appreciation would have done so.Based on a current price in the neighborhood of $62, we would have a jump of over 25%. Instead, we are getting around 25% of 1% over the course of an entire year via a dividend increase, and neither QCOM, NXPI, nor AVGO are able to move forward with business plans."
QCOM is a unique chipset maker that makes money without selling chips. Its IP biz is robust and brings billions. This stock should price at around 200 USD
I'M LAUGHING HERE AT THESE ARTICLE ABOUT APPL MAKES IT OWN 5G! EVEN INTEL HAS EXPERTISE IN CHIP BUSINESS FOR 60 YEAR COULD NOT EVEN BUILD A COMPARABLE 5G TO QUALCOM 5G! LET NOT TALK ABOUT THESE NON-SENSE! I'M A DESIGN ENGINEER AND I WORK in SEMICONDUCTOR IC Design Business. It takes more than 15 years to copy cat a IC design product line.
"Pure and simple, the market finally knows we have treasonous NWO administration!"
"rare situation. I get the point that it’s early to price in the incremental eps based on forecast without execution but tbh, the contract is already signed so it’s fair to price it in already. And they are also best in class in this game."
Rumor on the street is that Warren Buffet took share in QCOM. Great volumes in the first 30 mins today already.
"s20 using Qualcomm chip , apple using Qualcomm chip, all other major phones using Qualcomm chip. GM, VW, Honda, Audi etc using Qualcomm chip , Honeywell, Bausch, etc etc using Qualcomm chip, all major wireless equipment manufacturer use Qualcomm technologies and pay them royalties with the exception of you know who h.h.h. , 140,000 patents owned by Qualcomm. and you having the stock at less than $100!!!! really!"
Buy on the dips.....Qualcom will prevail and prevail BIG
Qualcomm is up 6.39% to 145.30
https://twitter.com/jamesowenthe3rd/status/1123136866025263105?s=12 The Twitter with docs : Apple to comment on possible settlement FTC/Q
qcom up big in morning followed by big volume sale rest of day downhill. So can't get real excited on any up day really. however over time always moves up (so far anyway)
AVGO up 400% QCOM up 3%.in the past 5 years. and QCOM is a better company.
Hedge funds got burnt so they manipulate all little people stocks to recoup
"The market is fudged. Makes no sense that all these great companies show great earnings and don't even move the needle. AAPL, QCOM, AMD. I quit investing."
"Apple 5G iPhones expected to begin volume production in July 2020, looks like we are taxiing onto the runway"
"Do those of you hoping for a QCOM “win” next week really think that would send the price of the stock higher?If so, I believe you’re badly mistaken. Because if a Broadcom “win” would result in a buyout at approximately $79/share and a QCOM “win” would result in an even better price for stockholders, the stock would likely be trading higher now. In other words, we’re not looking at a win-win, regardless of the vote. The stock price is telling us that there is another potential result - one that is not a long shot. And that is that no deal gets done. As the saying goes “be careful what you wish for”."

"congrats to all who hang on in difficult times, we should expect more tomorrow as analysts raise price and ftc settles."
buy ratings rolling in on this retirement stock..
Gotta laugh at the blatant price suppression here. Probably QCOM doing it to themselves to keep a lid on the buyback
"lets get to the next leg. up to 100. Qualcomm chipsets are in a number of phones, plus the 5g rollout"
".... Sell Qcomm? Why? Big div, growth prospect...... why wouldnt I hold his for years? They have billions in cash."
Alright got independence for QCOM to appeal in higher courts!!1
"I think QCOM has a chance to retest $65 and if it hits that price point will increase position. Don't think US-China trade talk will be smooth and if there is any supply chain disruption, watch out some major correction in the market place. September will be an interesting to watch and I believe it will most likely trade downwards."
$114 coming very soon as I mentioned 2 days ago. Jump in
Closing in on 200!
"It is simple now, If QCOM shareholders elect 6 members proposed by AVGO on March 6th, QCOM stock will trade close to $79 may be more (Possibility of further negotiations and price increase). But if 6 members are not elected QCOM will drop to $50."
Intel modem chips are slower and less relatable. They will be back once customers notice and stop buying the iPhone. Apple is playing hardball at it’s customer’s expense.
I'm glad Broadcom lowball deal was rejected.
"Is Apple still buying chips from QCOM? If so, under what conditions? If not, who has technology equal to QCOM? Seems like Apple will need to eventually pay QCOM what it owes if for no other reason than they agreed to terms. Going forward, Apple is free to buy from whomever they want but I would think they are contractually on the hook for past QCOM purchases. I am surprised it is taking this long for Apple to settle up. After all, Apple did force QCOM to renegotiate licensing terms and after all, isn't that the basis of Apple's argument?"
"Sold NXP...staying with QCOM. If deal miraculously goes thru it goes up. If it fails, it buys something else and goes up...if it does nothing, it goes up."
"Chazz and any others, these distractor's are simply doing their job to clutter the board, in fact based upon some of the images, they could be working from China or Korea. Luckily... this QCOM board is inhabited by people that have done their homework, that by no means that they will give up any time soon. people have made fortunes manipulating the PPS by posting garbage and distractions, the past weeks strength is wonderful, but lets not delude ourselves into thinking that given an opportunity they won't try something after Apple does their unveiling, but keep your eyes on the prize and remember, their are people more than willing to take your shares even at these prices, if you're willing to let them go today. Never forget the roughly 80% institutional ownership of QCOM, that alone should make people realize what they own.5G IS THE KEY... Cramer was talking it up this morning, marveling at the future impact it will have on our lives!"
The new CEO Amon is succeeding this business in difficult time. Hope he shows revolutionary recovery soon
I'd think MU will help all the 5G stocks based on its guidance!
"From the ER conference call, it seems we will have next two quarters to add position in QCOM before the 5G will actually pick up in the first quarter next year."
"Judge Koh has close to 10 days to talk to experts on chips, intellectural properties, trade politics, national security, both sides of the arguments, she could rule ANY MOMENT.Either Apple can settle up w Qualcom or face disappointment."
Bashers can't even stomach the thought of the $150s...
I'd like to see a Dividend increase. Shareholders deserve it. Otherwise I like the stock.

"Qualcomm 5G Home Broadband Reference Design Announced: Aquantia Multi-Gig Ethernet Inside""One of the key target markets for 5G deployments is ‘the last mile of copper’ from the local cabinet to the home. In order to avoid churning up streets to create fiber to the home, Qualcomm has repeated its intention to replace that last connection with some form of wireless, namely 5G.

"For Friends can't access to WSJ :05/19/2019 | 12:15pm EDTBy Asa FitchNvidia Corp., the computer-graphics giant that made a successful bet on chips purpose-built for artificial intelligence, is facing new threats to its market dominance as rivals enter a multibillion-dollar race to power everything from customer-service chatbots to robotic lawn mowers.Qualcomm Inc., long the leading designer of silicon for smartphones, unveiled a new AI chip last month for use in cloud computing that it plans to sell next year. Graphcore, a U.K. chip-making startup that recently secured $200 million in new funding from investors including Microsoft Corp., is testing its chips and plans to release them commercially in the second half of this year.Underlining the commercial prospects for AI hardware, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. on Friday reached a deal to acquire Cray Inc., a company that makes high-end equipment for supercomputers that are increasingly being deployed for AI research.Demand for chips specialized for AI is growing at such a pace the industry can barely keep up. Sales of such chips are expected to double this year to around $8 billion and reach more than $34 billion by 2023, according to Gartner projections.That growth is creating opportunities for everyone. But with increasing competition, it will be harder for a single company to stay on top of the race for performance, said Linley Gwennap, the president of the Linley Group, a Silicon Valley research outfit.""When you have so many different companies, there's a new chip coming out every month, and if that one happens to grab the lead, how long are they going to stay there?"" he said. ""There is going to be a lot of this leapfrogging going on.""Nvidia owns about three-quarters of the market for AI chips, based on Gartner estimates. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said some of the most sophisticated AI algorithms recently had been developed using Nvidia hardware.He said Nvidia also is working to make its portfolio more flexible for customers by customizing its robust general-purpose chips with AI-specific circuitry -- and developing software to speed things up further. ""I think that's a really great advantage,"" he said.AI software enables computers to mimic human activity such as having conversations, making recommendations and avoiding obstacles on the street. Such systems require machines to perform a gargantuan number of simple calculations at the same time. That kind of math has traditionally been done by the central processing unit, or CPU -- the brain of a computer. Yet CPUs, which make their calculations one after another, aren't as good at the task as chips with lots of small brains making calculations at the same time.Nearly a decade ago, Nvidia recognized graphics processing units it sold for videogame enthusiasts and other niche buyers -- chips that calculate how to display animated pixels on a computer screen -- were well-suited to AI because they work largely in parallel.The Santa Clara, Calif., company plowed investment into adapting its chips for AI, positioning itself for a boom. Nvidia booked almost $3 billion in revenue last year from selling AI chips used in data centers. Its stock price has risen more than eightfold over the past five years.On Thursday, Nvidia reported quarterly earnings that fell 68% but beat analysts' expectations. A slowdown in data centers where the company's AI chips primarily reside was one factor that led to the decline. Cloud companies that made significant purchases last year are getting the most out of existing chips before buying new ones, Mr. Huang said.Chip companies aren't the only ones building AI silicon. Cloud-computing giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc., huge buyers of Nvidia's chips, have started to design their own to meet their customers' specific needs. Their size -- Amazon's cloud unit had $25.66 billion in revenue last year -- give them ample resources to fund the high cost of development.""We can aggregate a bunch of customer demand on any workload type and justify investing in one of the specialized chips,"" said Peter DeSantis, vice president of global infrastructure at Amazon Web Services. In November, the Amazon cloud unit unveiled a custom processor called Inferentia optimized for a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The processors are to be deployed on AWS; Amazon doesn't plan to offer them to other companies.Intel Corp., already the biggest supplier of chips for computer servers, has gained a sizable foothold in AI chips for data centers by tweaking some of its most powerful CPUs to do better at AI tasks.Smaller companies, too, are building AI chips from the ground up. They include startups Mythic Inc., Graphcore and Habana Labs Ltd., which have drawn a surge of venture-capital interest after many years during which early-stage investors shunned chips."
"Broadcom said the improved bid is premised on either Qualcomm acquires NXP Semiconductors N.V. on the currently disclosed terms of $110 a share, or if that deal is terminated, and on Qualcomm not delaying its annual meeting past March 6. Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman said Broadcom's latest maneuver makes it ""abundantly clear"" that it doesn't want to own NXP.""What we think should not be overlooked is the notion that an acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm is a form of 'poison pill' to thwart a possible takeover by Broadcom,"" Ackerman said in a report Monday.If Qualcomm is dead set on remaining independent and buying NXP, it could appease Elliott and possibly make Tan go away by increasing its bid."
any more hope for this stock?
"If the Apple Board of Directors is looking out for the best interest of its shareholders, they will support a legal settlement with Qualcomm. Let’s get her done."
Intel has not 5Gtechnology.. how is possible that Apple switches to them???
"all fund managers are loading up QCOM, they want to show on their holding for the next report to the holders."
"Here is a key statement about going forward!!""The biggest surprise, however, is that the company is sticking to its annual 5G handset unit forecast of 175 million to 225 million units, which are very profitable for the company,"" Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said in an email. ""This is a very good sign for the company as it indicates 'business as usual' for 5G handsets.""Take that GoldDoom!! Also many comments about a very strong second half of the year. Reason why, Snapdragon has been signed up for every major phone make and even the small phone makes!!QCOM owns this space!! Cream comes to the Top!!"
Great technology can't go ignored. Smart decision by Apple.
"No analysts are bashing existing laptop or notebook portable computer companies. This is a field Nuvia will be exploiting in addition to auto and IoT. Wouldn't Qualcomm's Nuvia products be competition for all these companies, Apple, Dell, Hewlett, etc?"
Confirmed Breakout above yesterday's close..No resistance above...
"If these? analysts were any good, they would not be doing what they do. Bottom #$%$ of business"
120 after earnings
Let's go boys! Really hoping the price hike is not solely due to the buyback bid price.
"Why is QCOM up? Shouldn't investors be fleeing in panic based on the pending FTC case? I have learned that it is a mistake to dump qcom in a panic. I have done so a few times over the years, and it always was a mistake. QCOM is a leader in wireless chip technology."
"make the switch! ditch iPhones, get a Samsung Galaxy! cheaper, faster, more customizable!"
"TSMC to Spend $100 Billion Over Three Years to Grow Capacity(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its chip fabrication capacity, a staggering financial commitment to address booming demand for new technologies.TSMC, the world’s leading manufacturer of advanced semiconductors, already planned a record capital expenditure of as much as $28 billion this year, but recent trends and developments have pushed for even more capacity. Now at the center of a global chip supply crunch, Taiwan’s biggest company has pledged to work with customers across industries to overcome a deluge of demand.THE GAME IS……… ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TSM is... and... WILL REMAIN!!! THE WORLDS LEADING CHIP FABRICATOR!!!I'd love to be a fly on the wall at the INTC home offices tomorrow!!!Now... does anyone have any doubts as to how big the future of technology and that it is going to be driven by 5G??? I SURE DON'T!!!"
New tax law changes for interest deductiibility on debt would certainly give qcom pause to raise its bid for nxpi. It may also affect the amount of additional debt avgo may be willing to take on to raise its bid for qcom. Perhaps a higher portion of stock to offer if it increases its bid.
Expect a wave of upgrades going into earnings. QCOM reports 2/3/21
"Steady slide down, very disappointing. I sold my calls for a small loss. Was hoping to get out of them with a small profit prior to the bell. No sir, short term continues to be a bad stock with no confidence"
"Does anyone else notice that both sides are less hostile than before? Apple could have used stronger words after loss, perhaps Spotify gave Apple a wake up call, Apple and Qualcomm are actually on the same boat, licensing is Qualcomm's bread and butter, so does App Store tax."
QCOM won !! Jury agrees with QCOM on all claims.
its tax time. will be up next week. so I bought more under 124
"I'd like to buy this stock but I'm confused. We're less than 8 hours away from tariffs being imposed by the US and China and Qcom generates over 60% of their business from China. Further, China is purposely providing no certainty regarding the Nxpi merger. Can you explain why it's a good purchase at this point in time?"
"good Morning QCOM investors. The continued opportunity to own this great stock is still here. I honestly don't know how we are not over 160 by now. In the meantime, Apple is about to hit all time highs."
"They didn’t miss at all, Peter. Non gaap was .95 vs .85 estimate"
"Did you see SWKS report just now. Beat by 50%, huge........ But they are not even considered the King of 5G, QCOM is. Own both. Should prove an extremely interesting ER next week for QCOM!!!Long and strong 5G"
how long will courts let apple order suppliers not to pay qcom royalty? any other company than Qcom would have already been put out of business or forced to give in. Qcom has held on but in time this WILL severely hurt the bottom line. why should Qcom be forced to absorb this while apple continues to sell products without paying fees?
when the 9th sneezes against qcom the stock dumps $5 for days. now that that's over lets see a $5 pop for days
I don't think we can quantify the upper end potential of qcom until we know the settlement details with Apple. Got to be worth much more than 80 dollars a share.
"Folks keep this in mind…The US ban means that Huawei can't use these services from Google, Huawei unveils new operating system to use in place of Android.Without Google Android system Huawei is a second or third rate phone.Another reason they have to bow to QCOM for the Snapdragon 5G modem chip.Who is largest phone Manufacturer in the world? Huawei? (Samsung close behind). . So have the analysis added the increase in sales for QCom with the new #1?? QCOM has them in the Corner!!"
I received a message that Qcom will be supplying chips to Huawei
That is equivalent to 35% short squeeze (trying to cover)$100..
"Open interest for options expiring this week Mar-26 much heavier for puts than calls; by about 10k, so some more share buying from arbitrage on those. Also shares getting close to the prior daily low of 123.20 on Mar-08. Turnaround at that level?"
"We definitely need a new board and new blood in management, we need to see shareholder value rise!"
INTC just received approval to keep supplying Huawei. QCOM not far behind?
"What's up with the huge call buying? June 12 $85 calls -- 30,432 contracts volume today so far vs. 170 open interest. Buying at 63 cents. That is around a $2 million investment (on $243 million underlying equity) with only 11 days to expiration. Is news pending? I know ex-div is Wed, but that shouldn't account for that much buying for a very short term trade."
"I don't know why but QCOM seems to remind me of HP 10 years ago. A quality company with quality product line but mgt that just couldn't get out of its own way. The mgt of QCOM will continue collecting their salary and bonus as they ride this puppy into the ground, just like HP mgt did."
OkHe does not seem like face guy nor was mollenkoff They don’t have that pizazz but we will seeI wish Cramer would have Amon on to discuss the na sayers
"And there is the first ""apology"". Now when is this #$%$ going to apologize for his horrid QCOM call?""We are upgrading our rating from Sell to Neutral after Apple posted another large beat and implied a raise vs. our June revenue expectations. Our original view that the iPhone cycle would disappoint in the midst of COVID was clearly wrong. Not only has Apple done better than we expected on iPhone during the cycle but Mac and iPad have also materially outperformed our forecasts,"" analyst Rod Hall said in an early morning note Thursday after Apple's second quarter earnings. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-we-were-wrong-about-apple-101929474.html"
"In April, Qualcomm slashed north of 1,500 jobs, primarily in California. Qualcomm focusing on 5G and laid off 269 employees in all, including 144 in Raleigh, North Carolina, where its data center business is located, and an additional 125 in San Diego, the company’s hometown. This is the latest in a number of cost-cutting moves made by the company this year."
Bloomberg obtains information showing that at least half the votes already cast were in favor of Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) nominees for Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) board.
"Guys,with all the potential this company has with the implementation of 5G it makes no difference if you buy at 80,81 82,83 84,or 85. This is the best situated company to benefit from 5G. The price will increase dramatically and waiting for what you perceive the bottom might leave you in the dust. My advice is to just own it. Don’t just trust me. Do your own due diligence."
"I believe the CEO said this settlement with $AAPL gets them to $2 EPS. If thats the case, then this stock is undervalued still..."
"What’s funny is Wall Street chases those earning higher when companies miss current quarter but forecast the next quarter above. Same thing happened to QCOM. Their forecast exceeds top and bottom line. With a paltry sales miss, this after hours dumping of 8-9 mil shares is unjustified. They already said 1st half 2021 will be tight. Why else market needs comfort with its bright 5G business???"
Wow! Did not see this coming!
"Under consideration for this stock, why this one keeps dropping ? Anything wrong with the company ?"
"Who was it that said ""the market"" doesnt want the NXP deal? Up about 2% on the day ZTE signs agreement... paving the way for NXP deal to finally get approval."

"To those of you who think this is just going to get past US regulators with no problem, Trump already assigned a team back in August 2017, before the Broadcom offer, to investigate “… whether acts, policies, and practices of the Government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. “. Trump already saw the threat beforehand, what do you think he’s going to do when he sees this proposed merger which he was probably made aware of first through the concerned letters of respected congressman? Broadcom has undeniable connections to Chinese entities (see Duncan Hunter’s letter to Trump). There is no way this makes it past US regulators. When it comes to national security Trump’s mentality is always better safe than sorry. https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2017/august/ustr-announces-initiation-section"

"Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said in an interview. In China, smartphone demand is “very close to the level it would be normally but the mix of 5G is better than we expected.”Mollenkopf said the supply issue has largely been fixed and future sales will depend on consumer spending levels.Spending on the build out of the new networks is strong in China and has been maintained in North America, Mollenkopf said. In some parts of Europe it has been slowed by efforts to fight the virus. Still, the company is maintaining its annual prediction of from 175 million to 225 million 5G phone shipments. Those handsets require more expensive Qualcomm chips.Folks the future looks great!!! Snapdragon Rules!!"

"I have been long on QCOM for quite sometime now. However, I do feel this is good time for some profit booking if you bought QCOM in mid 50 about a year ago. On fundamentals, there is no doubt QCOM is doing great. Their cash flow is solid and was solid even when Apple stopped paying. But the headwinds are really annoying. My single most argument for near term sell is as follows:Judge Koh is very likely to reject the stay appeal. Once this appeal is rejected and before 9th circuit puts a stay QCOM will have to re-negotiate their licensing terms. Worst part is they have to open up for external monitoring. While QCOM has solid case for bringing a stay on court order, even under expedited process 9th Circuit will take about an year to do so. Meanwhile the damage can be quite serious. Also FTC has no incentive to settle. They will push for full implementation of court order, which is a terrible judgement for QCOM. And QCOM will eventually win the FTC battle (even head of FTC says Koh's decision is ""bad application of law""), it will not be anytime soon. At least not for next 2 years. Till then the uncertainty hangs over QCOM. Others can share their thoughts. Pls note that I am not suggesting to short QCOM. Do not do that. But if you are thinking of booking profit, I think this is the time."
"Nick, the CEO is fine. I have friends that work at Qualcomm and I can tell you he’s well respected and has more charisma then Mollenkopf. He just took over as you know and with Qualcomm’s strength in patents and business model, I don’t believe the street really puts that much into who the CEO is here, but he will do well in any event."
If we open and close above $130 then the bottom is in and we should rocket next week. Close today is important.
"AAPL has licensed all of QCOM's 5G patents. At the point they no longer purchase actual chips from them, AAPL will have to pay them a licensing royalty. Previous press releases has this royalty at 5% of a phone's value up to $500 for a ""full spectrum"" license (meaning including mmWave). Now, given QCOM is capacity constrained it seems to me that they would actually make a ton more money using the capacity they currently have dedicated to AAPL modem chips for additional higher margin Snapdragon while simultaneously cashing the register on royalties from AAPL."
INTC tanked on earnings. Don't believe that QCOM can possibly do better

Will they build their own Fab's, that will not happen, will they get Intel to make them, Intel can't get past 10nm spacing now.

Is it not strange that Qualcomm waited Till Right before the vote to come up with 90? Can you really trust those Guys?
"Enterprise 5G is so much larger than most ""retail"" investors realize. I think smart money sees it - this shake out is evidence of it. 5G for the enterprise will likely replace WIFI as it is faster, lower latency and better security. 5G is not just the next generation to 4G - it is a disruptive technology. It allows drones to delivery packages (5G network from a mobile truck), allows robotics in factory due to low latency, autonomous cars can leap forward, etc. This will grow and evolve over the next several years. I posted earlier using NVIDIA as an example of how it gets beat down right before an incredible run (almost triple in six months from 200 last year). AMD is another one ... sitting at 16 to 19 then sudden drop to 9 only to be followed by a run to 30. AMD had a disruptive technology and large TAM... it was obvious but they had to go through that shake out. Same thing happening here - so rest assured QCOM share price will grow ... likely to around 240 by year end. From there even higher as they have enterprise 5G locked and loaded - we are only seeing mostly mobile now... mobile is a fraction of the QCOM patent potential."
"READ IT AND WEEP IF YOU""RE A SHORT, S.A. JUST OUT WITH THIS!QCOM $200.00 PRICE TARGET JUST CALLED.the company is at the center of the unfolding 5G secular cycle, according to S.A. Baird has started Qualcomm with an Outprfrm rating and hi price target of $200"
Just a reminder that GS downgraded QCOM just 12 days ago. I wonder how much they were buying on their downgrade?
Why down AH?

This is why even legal monopolies are good. Stock could hit $150 if approval to sell Huawei comes through. Really no security risk in that.
No doubt about it. QCOM will goes up above $160 today & continues moving upward to $200+.QCOM is the next TSLA & NFLX of 5G.STRONG BUY!
"PROOF QCOM IS GAINING HUAWEI MARKET SHARE... Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp on Wednesday reported a 36.7% rise in fourth-quarter net profit, as its major Android rival Huawei steadily retreats from the global market due to U.S.-led sanctions.Adjusted net profit for the quarter ending Dec. 31 rose to 3.2 billion yuan ($490.84 million), beating analysts’ expectations of 2.9 billion yuan.Sales jumped 24.8% year-on-year to 70.5 billion yuan. Smartphone sales, which make up the bulk of the company’s revenue, hit 42.6 billion yuan, a 38.4% increase.In the October-December quarter, Xiaomi’s shipments in China surged 52% from a year earlier, and the company cornered 15% of the market share.AdvertisementFollowing a ban by Washington on key components placed on its smartphones, handset shipments by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd plummeted both in China and overseas, according to market research reports.Anticipating the opportunity, Xiaomi and other Android-based smartphone makers ramped up production of their devices towards the end of last year."
at least the dividend went up 4.6%

awesome recovery yesterday glad I added at 86 ..today market is red so we may see 88 but wont go below 88
While QCOM is one of my favorite stocks for the long term we are just one presidential tweet away from a 10% correction. Be careful.
blue!
Some people that sold covered calls to get a few extra pennies will be sad or have to buy closed for a loss. All that call closing will drive the price up more. I like it
Soon I'll be able to buy the entire company. Push shorties! Hahaha
"Good old Goldman. Up to their old tricks. Looking to maximize their buying window. Trillions of dollars in stimulus going into the economy, treatments looking promising which will get everything back to normal sooner rather than later, and they decide to cut QCOM to Sell (because their spreadsheet says they should ) just before the entire world starts switching their phones to 5G and QCOM gets 50% extra revenue per unit than in the past."

"Here is the real story here. Apple is a fan of this deal all day long. They are big fans of BRCM, because they only have to pay them for chips, not royalties for the technology that has enabled their entire ecosystem of revenue. Apple is behind this and Qualcomm knows it. 70 dollars, give me a break. There isn't a conversation with Management or Shareholders until this thing gets to 82-83 a share. Apple has put a lot of thought into how to manipulate their partners to squeeze everyonce of profitability they can get. There is nothing brilliant about this, Andrew Carnegie was the master at this business maneuver over 100 years ago. In any event, Qualcomm is not considering doing away with Royalty structure and Apple knows it, so along with organizing and colluding with other Qualcomm customers to manipulate their input cost, along with withholding payment within a contract agreement with Qualcomm and giving Intel the source code of Qualcomm, Apple has shown it is absolutely ruthless at pushing our laws bounds in their mission to pound down all of their partners into subservient/controlled rolls in the wonderful world of Apple. The US government hopefully is seeing through all of Apples methods of playing the game monopoly. Here is how I think this goes, Qualcomm get EU clearance for the NXPI deal, Immediately adding 10% to this stocks price, from there hostile offers can begin, but this company and shareholders will approve nothing short of 85 a share....and that is if the deal gets antitrust approval."
I asked the question the other day why did Huawei pay past royalties of 1.8 billion . ... there was no mention in this news of a supply agreement.. like we got with the Apple settlement.Now we no why .. they are now lobbying Trump to get this approved! Either give the 8 billion dollar market to Media tech .. this side of the business does not represent spying or national safety like the routers. If approved Qualcomm would grow another 10% in sales and I’m not sure what the royalty payments will be annually? But this could add another 10/20% in stock price. Buy now while it is low price before all the politicians in Washington get the gain b4 they approve the sales!!!
What would be the effect of Samsung’s Austin fab downtime due to winter storm and subsequent delays to ramp up to normal production on the upcoming QCOM earnings report. Based on some articles this facility makes QCOMs RFIC chips. This might not have an effect on the earnings but will probably lower guidance especially considering the supply constrained environment. Thoughts ?
"Potential outcomesFirst, the NXPI acquisition requires a 70% tender by 3-5. There is a 60-70% chance the tender hits 70% (currently at 28%). If it does not go through, all six AVGO directors are elected and QCOM is acquired at $82.If it does go through, AVGO gets 0, 4, or 6 board members. I still think AVGO wants QCOM, but will need to restructure the deal depending on on much board support they have. With 6 directors, the deal likely gets done for $55 cash and .125 shares of AVGO stock. They will need to go moderately higher with fewer board members, but won't over pay. Look for 15-20 times forward earnings of the combined company. QCOM just set their forward earnings at $2.75-$3.50. NXPI adds to that number. Plus AVGO can downsize the combined three companies and sell off units they don't need. I am thing they walk away if they don't get any board members and go $60 plus the .125 shares with 4 board members."
"This stock is going way past $150 in the next few years. They are innovating faster than any other chip maker with their processors and 5G. Intel is complaining which means they are seeing Qualcomm eating into their laptops and note books over the next few years. Micrsoft's Surface and Surface Pro laptops are Snapdragon powered, and they are beautiful. And of course everyone's complaining about how they QCOM to share their technology because they are all so far behind. This thing is unstoppable!"
"So the writer here says the trial so far has made qcom look bad. Really? Apple, making billions on their phone and phone-related ecosystem, is saying 7.50 per device is too much?? And they wanted to pay 1.50?? Who's the bully?? https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182441/apple-qualcomm-modem-iphone-xs-max-ftc-trial"
Well for everyone who didnt want the 80 bucks we now have a stock worth 60 !! hope everyone is happy !!!
qcom will definitely sell off following earnings report.
"From Forbes on the new QCOM 480Qualcomm Debuts New 5G System On ChipThe number of handsets shipping with 5G support should increase thanks to the launch of Qualcomm’s latest SnapDragon chip. The SnapDragon 480 is targeted at the low- to mid-range market, broadly speaking this would be the $250 price point, that . Andrei Frumusanu reports:""The new Snapdragon 480 is an extremely impressive SoC not merely because of its 5G feature list, but also because it’s a major performance upgrade in many aspects, including the use of two Cortex-A76 cores as its main performance CPUs – a very large jump in the 400 series family, likely representing a major leap in performance for millions of low-cost devices in the market."""
QCOM down to 54 and change -- market up . Are there any questions from those of you that were opposed to the Broadcom deal at either 79 or 82?

"OK... I tried to put up a link and once again the censorship police at Yahoo erased it, but there is an article with a video done by Forbes on QCOM's Technologies Licensing Business, On 5G IP and the 9th circuit, the headline of the article starts with... An Interview With Qualcomm’s Alex Rogers, EVP And President... so I'm sure that anyone interested will be able to search the text. I skimmed the text and haven't had a chance to watch the video yet since I wanted to get this shared to everyone, but here's some of the lines in the text. ""All said and told, the company has licensed over 10 billion devices, and holds over 140,000 patents and patent applications globally. According to Rogers, this makes Qualcomm the holder of the world’s most valuable patent portfolio and licensing business.""The bottom line... KNOW WHAT YOU OWN!Sunny skies here in NY, looking for the future of 5G to be even brighter!"
The iPhone 12 sold out in 45 minutes in Taiwan and sold 2.3 million units in China preorders. The 2021 numbers will be staggering.
The short seller Kerrisdale is under big pressure on short squeeze. I hope FTC ruling is against their wish and their short position is closed with huge damage as their non sense report damaged shareholders.
The smart investors switching from high growth hi tech to value stocks ... QCom is now both.. high growth and value since it has not moved and has dividend and potential growth with 5G just starting!!
"Did anyone read the shareholder letter from QCOM? At the very end, 2019 GAAP eps from the NXPI acquisition is only eight cents. They can only get to the $1.50 by backing out all of the dilution and acquisition costs (real costs)."
"Apple to introduce modem chip, replaces QCOM just like it replaces Intel CPU. remember it bought Intel's 5G modem division."
I would not be surprised to see their revenues jump into the $50B per year range with earnings around $10B a year by 2022. 5G is going to be huge...and it’s not just cell phones. $250.00 stock imo
DO NOT SELL BEFORE EARNINGS!! Increase in dividends and buybacks will be announced!!
Still waiting for 70 to get in. It appears it is unable to get past 80. There is also the threat of trade war so.....

We should see $150 within a month!!!!
A week or so ignoring my Qcom daily dose of disappointment. NXP fell to 92 due to missed EPS. QCOM offer is still at 127. I think the deal will go through. Isnt NXP free money now? I am thinking of buying it. Would appreciate any advice
We may see over $110 today and $115 tomorrow. Good luck longs
"Apple was probably behind all these craps:1st: they think unfair to pay higher fees from QCOM so accused QCOM all unfair practices but Apple on the other side wants to maximize their profits. All about profit margins.2nd: Since Broadcom has good relationship with Apple, so Apple wants to do some dirty works behind so later Broadcom come in to buyout QCOM with low price after 30% off that lawsuits tight with Apple.3rd: If Broadcom suuccesfully buyout QCOM, Apple will save more money for the long run. 4th: QCOM spent R&D money, not Apple. So Apple doesn't care. All Apple wants for free ride of lowest fees as possible to accused someone. Apple actually abusing its power as playing monopoly game, not QCOM.5th: Apple breaches QCOM's contract and sharing the codes with Intel. Apple won't get away for that bad behavior as Apple planned to break the relationship with QCOM and to go with Intel.Good news for QCOM:>> https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-adds-security-battery-life-203250925.html"

I wish intel buy Qualcomdey.I would say yes for 145.
QCOM will win the contract breach and tortuous interference lawsuit against Apple and CM's in a jury trial in San Diego and collect more than $7BILLION. Just in case the shorts weren't aware of this.
Qcom has broken through $115 today...every vibes and charts is indicating that its heading higher... will it break through $120 tomorrow? Maybe...we shall see tomorrow. Exciting time for qcom and its investors. Anyway i am convinced that we are going to reach $200 in 12 months or less. Good luck to all longs
Show me the $$$$money.
Anyone short is now trapped. Reverse head and shoulders and oversold. Should be up at least 5 percent today with follow through tomorrow. Great company to hold long term as well.

"I am glad I sold at $85 two weeks ago. I think Qualcomm is going to grow their earnings dispite the China trade problems but I think that will start somewhere in the third quarter. In the mean time, I dont think it is going anywhere. It may dip to $70 depending whether the trade issues get resolved. In the mean time, I am going to just watch it."

Why?
"This is so stupid, fear from inflation,you know the results of inflation mean , mean you will buy Qualcomm share 200 or 300 because all prices materials lot land gold shares will raise by inflation . Then why you sell . You want keep cash  at bank this is not make sense!!!!!!"
holding all together 1761 shares . God less Qualcomm and all the longs here.
BUY BUY BUY !! Great stock at a great discount
"The FCC has set a record with auction of key spectrum for 5G use, so obviously they are expecting a substantial ROI on that money, so going forward, is there really any doubt about how massive the 5G networks and their effect on our every day lives 5G is going to be? Last week the FCC wrapped up an auction of mid-band spectrum in the C-band. The airwaves are in the range of 3.7GHz-3.98GHz and the heavy demand for the rare mid-band spectrum helped generate a record $80.9 billion in proceeds related to the auction, that's just for the rights to the airwaves, not a single piece of hardware is included in that CAPEX... INCREDIBLE!"
Why is this stock price up only 3% in the past 5 years now that all the obstacles facing QCOM have been overcome? Seems to me it should at least be at the $82 price of 5 years ago and more likely have kept up with the S&P500 return and be about $120. Think $120 is a likely price within the next year.
"To those that understand this case better than I.....as I understand it, basically two things can come out of this trial. First, the requirement that qcom license its SEP's to other chip OEM's. But i believe that was already mandated in Nov in the partial summary judgement, so I suppose this would be an affirmation. And on this point, is qcom already complying? Second, the 5% number can be reduced or maintained. But since it cannot be eliminated, the question will be what the F in FRAND comes out to. Gotta be between 1-5%, right? Just trying to create my own little summary. Thx in advance."

what about the buyback? isn't is going to raise the stock price??
Why sell at the Dutch Auction? Make no sense to me.
This looks like 2 steps forward and 10 steps backwards- Why can't we break 140+++++???
We are backing to the pre earning price. Lol
"To all of those criticising Qualcomm on this post for not reducing their royalty rates for Apple, take note that Qualcomm has MFN Clauses in all of its licensee contracts which would entitle those licensees to the benefit of any royalty rate reduction granted by Qualcomm to Apple. Therefore since Apple has nowhere else to go but to use Qualcomm technology why would Qualcomm bend to to Apple's pressure. it's a very slippery slope for Qualcomm and there is no logical reason to go down it."
Qcom was a darling of 2000 era. Due to legal issues it kept down long by shorts. That is the truth. But today showed some real performance. It should continue to 130 levels of Momo picks up regardless of the noise
"I don't understand the monopoly court ruling; the proof is in the Apple case. Apple tells Qcom to forget it, we'll buy Intel chips. The market is free and competitive, Qcom saying you want better chips, you have to pay. Apple realizes it needs to upgrade all those iPhone 6's to 5G and therefore changes their mind. They are not forced to buy the Ferrari chip, they could have stayed with the Ford chip! Until there are no other options because 5G is universal, Qcom is not a monopoly."

Calling some serious BS that we're pulling back due to high multiples in tech. QCOM by no means is trading at a high multiple and yet the market is still taking it down.
Lucy Koh needs to look at why QCOM withheld a one billion dollar rebate from Apple! Do your homework judge. Perhaps she knows the answer but doesn't want it heard! Sorta like asking repeatedly wasn't that redacted! It might not be the same billion that Qualcomm refused to return. Apple behaving poorly again and again!

"So much bluster, rhetoric, and craziness on both sides (companies and folks on this board). Here is my take on the facts as this moment in time.First and foremost. There is a CFIUS investigation. This is a serious, non-trivial matter. On the macro level, I see three possible outcomes. Based on their history, the most likely outcome is that CFIUS will require remedies to their concerns from AVGO, but will let the shareholder meeting proceed in four weeks. The second most likely outcome is that they will not be appeased by the remedies and will simply stop the transaction. The least likely outcome is that they will ask for another delay. I doubt this outcome because 1) it is such a high profile case, and 2) they are approaching jurisdictional deadlines.The second item is the QCOM acquisition of NXPI. As it currently stands (lack of significant tender, lack of regulatory approval), it is highly unlikely that QCOM will be able to acquire NXPI. The odds are almost nil if CFIUS allows the AVGO deal to continue, somewhat higher, but still unlikely absent AVGO.There is no other suitor waiting to swoop in and save QCOM from AVGO and from itself. If the AVGO transaction does not proceed (close to 50-50, but, due to potential remedies, probably a little in AVGO's favor), QCOM needs to come up with an entirely new plan.It is highly likely that all six AVGO nominated board members will be elected if the slate proceeds and a vote occurs.It is highly unlikely that AVGO will voluntarily either decrease or increase the current bid. It is possible, but not very likely, that the new BoD will enter negotiations for a higher price. If so, I would think a $1-$3 increase is about all that can be expected. So, the purchase price very likely be $82 with a very small chance of increasing, but probably not past $85.Assuming the AVGO deal is inked at $82, the QCOM price should rise to the $78-$80 range almost immediately; potentially a little higher initially as shorts cover.If neither the AVGO or NXPI deals are finalized, the QCOM pps should settle into a $58-$62 range for the next couple of years. It might initially drop a little further, but should rebound to that range fairly quickly.If the AVGO deal fails and the NXPI deal is inked (I view this scenario as probably the least likely of all), the QCOM price will probably settle into a $60-$64 range for at least a year. Even with the rosy QCOM earnings projections, thay don't see actual GAAP earnings from QCOM until at least FY20 (FY19 is 8 cents). AAPL will be in no hurry to come to a settlement agreement."
Tomorrow we test 93.

"FROM TSMC PRESS RELEASE THIS AM....The company has flagged ""multiple years of growth opportunities"" as the COVID-19 pandemic fuels demand for advanced chips to power devices such as smartphones and laptops."
"Here is the net net of the situation. The market/economy has always risen during years with rising interest rates. Treasuries at 1.6 is way lower relative to history. Any rising interest rate will not break anyone with regard to debt. It may mean some re-balance portfolio, etc. Net net this treasury scare is a nothing burger and will pass. On to chip shortage - QCOM just two days ago said they would deliver on their forecast so I really think they will. Yes additional growth beyond forecast may be delayed a quarter - but their forecast was pretty dang good and justified alone a higher valuation than we are seeing. Demand will remain and this thing will pop big when chips free up for sure - probably over correct! So the net net is no reason to worry - just sit back and watch wallstreet ensure they make big bucks off the backs of mom and pop."
ATH finally broke thru: At this price Qcom is both a growth stock and value stock. And we get paid a dividend while we enjoy the ride. Blue sky ahead
Apple should make the right business decision and settle with QCOM. They probably won't and they won't have good 5G alternative very soon. QCOM is still viable no matter what happens in the lawsuit. I think all the bad news is priced in for QCOM if it goes that way. Lots of upside if it goes in QCOM favor. Downside resistance looks to be around $52.
This one should be back to where it belongs. Break the 140 support today!

"Qualcomm Plans to Battle Nvidia, Intel and Others in the AI Accelerator Market""The mobile chip and patent giant is expanding its addressable market by entering the fast-growing -- and highly competitive -- market for AI inference accelerators.""""The inference accelerator market is quite competitive, and Qualcomm is arriving relatively late to the show. But the company has made some impressive performance claims for the Cloud AI 100, and has clearly put effort into creating a product built for the needs of cloud giants. That could help it win some clients in a market that's unlikely to be a winner-takes-all one.""""And just as it has made sense for Qualcomm to invest in growing its automotive, IoT, RF and Wi-Fi chip businesses at a time when smartphone sales are sluggish and a lot of uncertainty surrounds the company's massive patent-licensing business, there's certainly some logic to going after a fast-growing inference accelerator market with the help of silicon and software expertise built up while developing other products.""https://www.thestreet.com/investing/qualcomm-is-jumping-into-an-ai-accelerator-market-featuring-nvidia-intel-14920652"
Folks we should have another Catalyst coming up soon they will rule in favor of QCOM and strike down Lucy Koh's insane ruling!! The climate right now is to protect our great high tech companies like QCOM! It is in our countries best interest to rule against what she did. Our 5G infrastructure needs to be super secure. And Qcom needs to be allowed to make money off of it Intellectual properties or patents! That is how capitalism works!!
Nice breakout today on what looks like heavier than average volume. Would be nice if we could close above $116 again. Should be a good next few weeks for the Q with a potential iPhone 5g event on 10/13.
CNBC just gave QCOM a mention. Their PE is only 17 x Cheap !
Looks like China’s iphone ban for infringing Qualcomm patents is starting to have an impact on sales there.
"All week, Bloomberg TV was really talking up the semiconductor shortage. And so much coverage of Qualcomm's great earnings. QCOM will keep going up and year."
Apple is gonna lose even if they win at the courts .. companies like QCOM are specialists when it comes to mobile technology. Going to intel is just playing a bluff. Intel has it's own set of problems right now. Being deprived of the best 5g mobile modem will start the fall of apple
"Tim Cook in his quest to screw QCOM and not pay for IPRs and breach the contract that Apple signed, tiedup with Intel transferring proprietary info, source code, etc to develop 5G tech, just as he had done with 4G. Apple instigated the FCC, foreign governments including Korea, Japan, China, Japan to fine, or reduce/withhold royalty payments. Using all kinds of fried chicken analogy. What Tim Cook and his engineers did not understand is that base band chips, in concert with other RF components, power control, etc are very complex to design, especially regarding 3G/4G and more important 5G. We are talking about complex wave transmission, interference, etc. A whole different game than designing power hogging microprocessors which is the core competency of Intel. No wonder the Intel 4G chipset is power hog and has low performance.Tim Cook bet the future of Apple on second stringer Intel for cutting edge 5 chips... in order to save $7.5-1.50=$6.00 or less than 1% of ASP of the iPhone. Talk about greed! Yes, Apple had to give up before the trial. Worse, is that Apple has been loosing market share in the smartphone market due to hi prices and lack of innovation. It is too late for the iPhone to have a 5G phone this year, while the competition will start selling them. Expect the iPhone market share to decline further. It is likely to affect their service revenue. Apple has not innovated much lately. Financial services are limited and late. They should have offered secure biometric based B2B, B2C, C2C, multi plaform, multi currency banking services, point of sale services, social networks, e-commerce, etc. Steve Mollenkopf stuck to his guns.,, kind like Churchill after the Blitzkrieg of France. QCOM has to deal with FCC plus the China/Huawei. FCC is unlikely to wipe out QCOM contracts and biz model at this stage. Huawei will cave in due to political pressure, especially if they want to export. QCOM is not an easy stock to hold. This time around I had only a small position prior to the trial which I increase within minutes of settlement. Nothing that will change my life at this stage of the game. Unlike in Sep-98 when I bought 6,250 shares at $38. Did not sell when the stock spike to $850 ($1,700+) in 15 months after QCOM won a legal case against Nokia (or Ericson?). Sold in 2005 for a fraction. This time around, I did not have the courage to make a big bet and I felt the upside was limited since QCOM is already an established company. Looking back, I should have bought a bucket of out of money call options expiring this month. A lot less risky that buying the stock. A loss in court for QCOM would have knocked the stock to $20 or less, especially with all the debt.I figure the upside is $100-120 in the intermediate term. Downside is bad if the FCC case goes bad."
"Worst semiconductor chip stock to own since last earnings. Down worse then any other and this is factual, not a lie"
"With a good job report, trade truce, and lift of Huawei as well as 5G tech, QCOM will have a bright future."
"Just got done watching a 30 minute interview with QCOM CEO that aired last night on Bloomberg TV that I recorded, the show is Leadership Live With David Rubenstein, they covered lots of areas from surviving the pandemic, to the future of 5G and relationships with China. Mollenkopf is a smart man and he is confident thst 5G is moving ahead despite what the naysayers here would have us believe.I guess the question is did you buy, or do you, want to buy QCOM looking for a 30 day miracle, or is it something you'll be happy you bought in 3 to 5 years?Technology almost always wins."
Counter offer from Intel in the horizon!
The financial rags have given investors a unique opportunity to buy QCOM cheap. This is your last chance. Get in now!!!
"“Apple intends to solely use our competitor's modems rather than our modems in its next iPhone release,” explained Davis.This competitor is Intel and independent testing has repeatedly shown this month that Qualcomm modems deliver vastly better real-world 3G and 4G performance compared to Intel modems. For example, almost 500,000 user tests on T-Mobile and 570,000 user tests on AT&T showed typical download speeds to be 53-68% faster while worst-case download speeds were 97-192% faster.These are not small numbers.I guess iPhone users blame their slow speed on their carrier because they just don't know any better!"
"FYI, check this articles to help you understand about the current situation which the QCOM is facing Qualcomm: Apple Is A Problem, But Not Worried https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394309-qualcomm-apple-is-problem-not-world"
Quote is X dividend so technically up today. Also market is down due to Italian political issues. Let us wait and see
It’s doing great
"Wow, ended up lower than before earnings. I guess we will see $128 again before $158"
"QCOM management with all INSIDER INFORMATION paid over $60/share, spending BILLIObuying Back shares.I JUST PAID UNDER $50.... i am not known to be the sharpest tool in the tool shack.May be I can be CEO of QCOM.... at least Sr VP of asset management??!!"
"With the intel news just coming out, the boost from the Apple deal not even close to being priced in, and the countless upgrades coming tomorrow, does anyone see any way the stock doesn’t end the trading day above at least 85$? I genuinely would like to hear from someone that doesn’t. I was originally expecting a temporary pull back until the pricing in of the Apple deal completed later this week, but with this intel news I don’t see how it skips the pull back and bulls right up to the 85-90$ range by the end of tomorrow. They literally don’t have competition now"
never lost a faith in this one
Go qcom. Great upbeat forecast by micron. Go 5 g.
Excellent summary !!!https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190825/analyst-angle/ftc-qualcomm-appeals-decision

Thank u Jared Kushner and Don Jr. forforcing us to elect a good human being who is a socialist.
"When Apple formally announces iPhone with qcom 5G chip, you can bet that qcom will jump $20+"
"It does not matter, but the QCOM would not be going higher for couple of days .but after that we continue the upward journey . as some said they started on the development now if they get succeed then QCOM is in trouble . but like intel they spent so much money and the failed. and Intel has 60 years experience in chip making , No apple just starting the development , well good luck on that .I wait till this bottom of this temporary pull back and then I jump in head first ."
"For comparison, AVGO's management and BOD own 3.3% of that company which much more closely aligns the financial incentives of shareholders with the team. Vote blue."
140 is indeed way overpriced.
Qcom does not need this deal.the stock price of 82 and higher can reach there on it's own.
"As vocal as trump has been about the 5g race and protecting our tech vs china, i would be stunned if the trial starts and continues unimpeded by settlement. If that were to occur, then it's also possible that one day trump wakes up and a headline reads ""5G Champion Qualcomm Severely Damaged By Loss"". No way. Especially knowing that apple actually brings nothing to the table in terms of our country advancing the cause of 5g leadership. I will say however....I'm really surprised it's even gotten this far."
That GS downgrade to sell ain't looking too smart is it ! I wonder how much they bought on their downgrade?
"With the 1st selection in the 2021 NFL draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars select QCOM, chipmaker, San Diego... "
"Down worse then all other semi chip stocks, laughable how poor this performs"
"Is it a good time to start a position yet, or wait for $120 ?"
PT = $35 in 6 month.... considering we are in an overbought market (45% up since a year ago)
"As for revenue, estimates call for 13.1% growth this year and an acceleration up to 23% growth in fiscal 2021. The numbers here are astounding really, and Qualcomm investors may be set to be major beneficiaries.As Citi analysts recently argued, the company has big exposure to the coming wave of 5G. As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung and other companies shift to 5G service, it translates to top- and bottom-line growth for QCOM. That’s why analysts are so bullish on the coming 24 months of business."

I am thinking EPS could hit $8-10/s as the 5G tornado kicks in. Increased sales of 5G chipsets with increased ASP and margins. PE expansion to 18-20. Not too many competitors supplying 5G chipsets. Samsung asks for stiff commercial terms. Huwei is a security risk. Intel is out of the game. Rest are not even close.
"Todays WSJ front pageNotes Huawei's dominance of 5G world wide, while the FTC wants to decimate QCOM 5G (withthe help of Apple, of course)"
Jack up the offer price.... I want 80 at least.. 100 would be more favorable.
"Samsung Galaxy S21 series will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, and possibly an upgraded ultrasonic fingerprint sensor"
Stock was $66 five years ago. It has done nothing except frustrating shareholders every earnings season and mounting legal problems and now mgmt can't even process a takeover offer properly
https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/14/apple-concedes-qualcomm-german-iphone-ban/?yptr=yahooIt sounds like Apple is done trying to fight an injunction in Germany broughtabout by its legal battle against Qualcomm
I predict that APPL will return to buying their chips from QCOM within 2 years.
Thanks again for the great dividend yesterday to be paid out March 21st.
This is huge! Start investing now! Before you miss out on the ride
"Interesting that no one is talking about Apple modem anymore ); With Qualcomm pipeline of X65, X70 and X75 modems and future 6G they are so far ahead that Apple with its failed ex-Intel team has no chance. Qualcomm is going to be in Apple for many years to come."
give me some love here...Anonymous2 days agoIll predict up as much as 3 bucks a.m. then close up about 1 - 1.50
SMH is up meaning QCOM TSM will rise from here as usual!
It’s bad for Apple because they just bought a failed 5G from Intel. And I don’t believe they could get around QCOM’s IP.
"There are 16 million shares shorted, not for long. I will say the short position on QCOM will decline by a huge amount. Remember Shorts can lose for ever!!"
Short squeeze will move the price much higher than 100 and it just started.
I am expecting to see $145 - $150 this week guys....since the whole world is shorted in chips. I own QCOM TSM MU NVDA & INTC recently!
"Folks are underestimating Qualcomm activities outside of cellular, particularly in Automotive. Below is an excellent article from eetimes. When analysts catch on Q will really catch fire - remember NVDA and AMD. But by then it will be too late.https://www.eetimes.com/why-qualcomm-is-set-for-auto-dms-dominance/"
Watch for 120 support !!
should I buy now? I'm a bit new to investing and I still hope to hold this for long but is it best to just wait for earnings and buy tomorrow? I don't want to miss any gains but I know how rocky things can be during earnings date and the potential for them to miss the mark
"Long and I ain’t worried at all. Excellent company, great financials. Great growth and potential with 5G. Ask me in 3-5 years how I fell about purring some of my novavax profits here."
$86.66 today or no food&water whole weekend!
I think Mollenkopf chose to step down now to give Amon a good launching pad to announce quarterly results. I believe Q will have a monster quarter announcement perhaps coupled with divy raise. Stock is very cheap compared to NVDA/AVGO/AMD. Can easily blow through 200s.
"Few things to know:1. If the back payments are part of the projected EPS?2. If the $2 EPS estimate is coming only from the licensig business or that includes chip profits as well?3. If the increase in EPS is effective from next coming quarter or later?If the answer is yes to any, then the current price is way undervalued.I think we might get clues to some or all come May 1st."
"I have held Qualcomm for close to 30 years. Ever since the 1 St CDMA Sony Digital phone came on the market. Then it followed with 4 forward flips. If the 4 forward flips never happened. $2,000 today. I see $.05 cent increase in dividends for June. Next year 1 St Q 2020 I see an increase of $.75 to dividends. There is a reason why most of Europe did not update its networks. Most of all Europe was waiting for 5 G next year."
Mediation is integral part of the appellate process; so FTC and Q should settle after stay is granted...
"INTC 3x plus the market cap of qcom. That, and no constant overhang of legal mess. I used to be a cfo. The process of properly reserving for and disclosing potential legal liabilities was mind numbing and no cfo wants to attach his/her name to such subjective estimates. I have no idea why he left but I bet those two reasons were at least part of it."
"If nVDA sales not so good, QCOM pops because it justifies it..if nVDA sales meets esitmates, QCOM still pops, because it relatively cheap..win win."
"In yesterday’s court case, Qualcomm expert estimates, that the value of battery life is 1.90 USD per phone for 15 min. So one hour battery life is 7.60 USD, 12 hours 91.20 USD. 2 patents of Q being used by Apple give 3% more battery life equaling 2.74 USD. One patent gives 1.50 USD because of one flash memory chip less for manufacturers. Would be interesting to see the assessment of the jury for the value of patents, as Apple was saying during FTC case that all patents of Q (SEP and non SEP, > 100.000 patents) would have a value of 1.50 USD royalties per device. Q wants to charge 7.50 USD after all volume and other related benefits. So it will be interesting Decision next week, once trial is over...."
"Volumes are incredible. Big investors use the opportunity to load, as long as it it cheap. I’m astonished that obviously many short term interested investors are willing to sell at these levels. Don’t think it’s possible that only traders generate these volumes. So the big investors are right to use the situation. Scenario for the next quarters? May: in focus will be settlement with Apple, increase of EPS. Good guidance, but careful. Stock will move to 90. September: effects of 5G and other measurements will lead to further increase of EPS. Accelerated Share Repurchase to be finished. Balance Sheet will show payment from Apple. Q’s Balance Sheet will look like a fortress. Strong guidance. Share price will move > 100. Year End: Apple scope of business will be integrated fully into guidance of 2020. 5G will strengthen brands in China, a lot to win from Snapdragon-brands worldwide, it’s just starting. Share price > 120. FTC settlement, Huawei settlement, end of trade tensions and other activities from Q not even included. Any buying price under 95 is super attractive. Use it !"
"Nokia, Elisa and Qualcomm Achieve 5G Speed Record in Finland Combined Speeds from two Devices hit 8 Gbps on a Commercial 5G Network on mmWave Spectrum – – Supports Low-latency, High-bandwidth Services such as High-speed Video Downloads and VR/AR – Nokia, Elisa and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. today announced that they have achieved the world’s fastest 5G speeds on a commercial network in Finland by delivering 8 Gbps for the first time serving two 5G mmWave devices connected simultaneously"
"If Q win this FTC case it will be a huge win, if Q loses the case it will probably appeal to the 9th Circuit and/or SCOTUS to reverse. That appeal could takes years to be decided. In the meantime expected be business as usual to continue and the new 5G, IoT, AI….. could dominate and change the whole business structure. I still believe at the end of the day, the FTC would like to settle with Q as long as they agree on Q to negotiate in good faith with their licensee period no fines no restrictions just to save face."
How bout 135 tomorrow
how about a short squeeze
wondering what will be the next tender price .. 72-75 ?
"Everyone's too fussed about all the little.things. The main thing is Qualcomm is going to dominate when apple start doing 5g and in the meantime you're getting a nice lil dividend, especially for a tech stock with such growth potential. Shut up and load up on this stock whilst it's a bargain."
Are we back to 90?

"Bagholders, better take this opportunity to sell while Dow is still doing reasonably well.If you believe overall Market's peaked out and QCOM is trading at $50/share now, imagine where QCOM will be trading at when Dow corrects another 10%, or even 20%?"
"I've just read through the Q2 (Mar qtr) transcript and the questions from Rob Hall and the Deutsche analyst. They downgraded BEFORE the ER. Since the beat was 14%, and answers to their questions included words like 'China is a tailwind for us', ""expanding margins"", etc, etc, I expect to see upgrades from both Deutsche and Goldman."
be nice to see a 4 dollar day
Remember there is a one time payment from the royalties Apple owns Qualcomm of at leadt $7 billion. This will be used to buyback or special dividends. Either way shorts and puts will be toasted... Do not short or sell until earnings on the 1st of May!!!
Seems like demand for Iphone 12 is much more than expected. QCOM should continue to rise.
"So I'm bummed out today. Almost everything is green except my 3 holdings of 5G stocks. What's up with that?So what do I do when I get depressed? I go out and buy something. Just happens to be a nice amount of out of the money, short expiration options on QCOM. I've been saying the ER will be a BIG BEAT, so now I've put even more money to back up what I've been saying. Good luck to Longs. Long and Strong QCOM, Long and Strong 5G."
Not crazy about the daily volume trend last few days. Sold an August long call and sold a May call short.
The decision by Powell was what I expected. What Qualcomm needs now is a China deal and the stock will soar!
Now we know why the hit job happened.... Reports are that Apple plans 30% boost in production of I-phone.. per Jim Cramer.
I don’t care about volatiles. 5G technology is a future development....
"Again I thank Mr. Mollenkopf, Dr. Jacobs and the rest of the QCOM board for their dedication towards protecting their own interests while minimizing shareholder value."
"Getting shook here, but not letting my emotions hit that sell button. I’m going to cover my eyes from this stock and only leave enough gap through my hands to slightly read the market news."
This is a game of negotiation. Of course 82 is asking price from AVGO. QCOM never told anything from their end. If one ask and if they have any price in their mind it will be around 100 - 110. even though they know they will not get that. Do not forget that AVGO will also get NXPI with it since qcom is acquiring NXPI for 38B. I believe this is why QCOM thinks they are worth more than 82 a share. Board of QCOM thinks Christmas in February and March is an excellent season. They also know no one will offer them any better price than 82 so now they have to think hard weather they should let go this offer or not. Based on todays comment it seems they want AVGO to come to table again and make finalize the offer with little bit of more money and brake-up fee. may be 85-90 price per share and 10B brake-up fee
Should do what AMD did. Up 10% then deep RED by the close. Funny last good earnings down $50. Blowout earnings and up $5. Ponzi market
"We are trade deal pending.If all major issues are resovable, it will be great for QCOM, Apple, and whole list of tech stocks from both countries.... like unclogging the log jam, everything will FLOW AGAIN."
"Sold almost all of my non-tech positions yesterday and this morning. Dumped everything from financials, XLE and Marriots and shoved huge positions into Apple, QCOM, Broadcom and Qorvo. Chips are the key to the future, period. ALLLL-IN."
I bet close at 138.

For 5g doubters
"Source : seeking alphaEach time someone buys a mobile phone, Qualcomm QCOM...makes a little bit of revenue. That’s because Qualcomm is the brains behind much of the knowhow that powers smartphones, including code division multiple access (CDMA) for third generation (3G) wireless networks, and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) for 4G. The wireless world is now on the cusp of another big network upgrade to 5G, and Qualcomm has a hand here, too. Qualcomm isn’t as domineering in this area, but 5G phones have to be backward-compatible, so they contain 3G- and 4G capability. The upshot: Qualcomm’s licensing business will continue to see solid growth for years to come as 5G ramps up. The company also designs chips used in smartphones, but licensing and royalty business represents about 75% of operating income.Importantly, COVID-19 doesn’t seem to be hurting the roll out of 5G. It’s a leading indicator for the health of Qualcomm, says the company’s CFO Akash Palkhiwala, so this is key for investors. Surprisingly, Qualcomm maintained its 2020 guidance for its 5G business in its late April earnings call. “We feel very comfortable with the full year guidance,” Palkhiwala told investors. In a hint of what may come soon to the rest of the world, about three-fourths of mobile phones launched in China so far this year were 5G. Qualcomm also benefits from two major long-term trends: The increasing wireless capabilities in cars especially as they add self-driving capabilities, and the Internet of Things."
"A great article, basically almost announcing the advent of 5G in industrialization, search the text for the full story, no price tag was discussed, but IT'S HAPPENING FOLKS, check for intentional spelling errors before you search.Verizon said on Monday it has struck deals with Nicrosoft and Mokia to improve the telecoms giant's ability to target business customers by offering clients the ability to automate factory floors, lower costs and speed up data traffic through private 5G metworks.Private 5G networks remove the need for bisinesses to jostle for speed with others on a public network and help enable data-intensive applications that use computer vision, augmented reality and machine learning to increase productivity."
"People sell at market for no reason, pls dont follow them."
$120 when all said and done.
"What would really help QCOM is if press coverage (not just trade rags) started speaking to the transformation of factories, medical, autos due to 5G rollout. It would be great if 5G branding changed to more than cell phones. I think this is coming - also the QCOM summit will speak to some of this but we need ""coverage"" !! QCOM's revenue in IOT growing from $1B to $1.3B QoQ is pretty significant - and EXTREMELY surprised (not really surprised) that the analysts didn't ask what they heck is driving this growth!! This is the story."
"I thought QCOM went to the toilet on Wednesday, even though it has great news from AAPL. At this price I still think it is so cheap, made it up from the last three years. it will shine from now on, and I think it will rise up to the challenge of Huawei. Now it will depend on Steve which I think he is brilliant."
"QCOM has several positions in the evolution of 5G that appear to indicate the share are substantially undervalued and within the near term and next few months, $200+ may be already in the cards. It does appear that QCOM will soon present without much resistance new highs to my target price, which has for quite some time presented itself were to occur unbound by the prior events that kept the pressure on the share price."
"The secret communique with CFIUS is proof positive that QCOM never intended to negotiate, that all of their PRs were lies, a nd that they need AVGO now more that ever. It looks like the March options are toast, but my April and June options should be great as I see a near unanimous blue vote by institution investors."

What was clear to me after looking at these charts is the 2022 sales growth #s for QCOM are way low which is typical at this point until Analysts update their forecast. I expect they are unsure about handsets, etc. If QCOM would come out with a 2022 guidance that would do the trick!

I like reading everyone’s reactions to today’s proceedings. However I thought yesterday was a good time to get in. Oops. Didn’t do my homework. Wondering if I should just take the loss and invest in something else. Any suggestions?
"Add another 50 million+ annual 5G/mmwave Ipad's to the 5G revenue stream going forward. Prolly a minimum of 20-25 $/unit.....straight into QCOM's pocket. If my math is right, that's another $1/share earnings."

"Oh my this is good news...Happy freakin New Year! Apple's iPhone 12 supercycle reality 'meeting the initial hype,' says Wedbush Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the firm's Asia supply chain checks on iPhone 12 5G demand point to a trajectory that now exceeds his ""bull case scenario"" for units in FY21, contending that it appears the iPhone 12 supercycle ""reality is meeting the initial hype"" so far. Based on recent Asia checks, he believes the supply chain is anticipating iPhone unit builds in the low to mid 90M range for the December quarter and for the March quarter he thinks builds for total iPhones ticked up another 5% over the last week and are now in the 60M-70M range, Ives tells investors. While the Street is forecasting roughly 217M iPhone units for FY21, based on the current trajectory and in a bull case, Apple has the potential to sell more than 240M units and ""250M could be in the cards,"" added Ives, who keeps an Outperform rating and $160 price target on Apple shares with a ""bull case"" target of $200."

"Anyone that sold this stock in the 120s must be the most weak minded people in the world.

I am just glad that during this ""down"" period I was able to add another 1340 shares. I can't wait until earnings and then Q3 and Q4 earnings when I am almost certain we will be over 200.

Will QCOM deliver as SPEC DIVY ???? Lots of cash now
Big investors are buying and adding QCOM if you are listening to CNBC now....
"NUVIA acquisition, what Qualcomm says about Windows, Android smartphones computers and auto for H2 2022;Qualcomm Technologies expects to integrate next generation CPUs across a wide portfolio of products, including powering flagship smartphones, laptops, and digital cockpits, as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, extended reality, and infrastructure networking solutions. The first Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms to feature Qualcomm Technologies’ new internally designed CPUs are expected to sample in the second half of 2022 and will be designed for high performance ultraportable laptops."
"For those that have not read the real reason QCOM won here it is. This is why car and smartphone companies can cry all they want to the FTC about appealing, it still would not matter. The full court will come to the same conclusion.""The trial seemed to invoke mixed responses from within the government as the Department of Justice — the other primary antitrust regulator in the country — disagreed with FTC's legal theory and viewed the decision as anti-consumer. The Pentagon and the Department of Energy also observed that the enforceability of the decision would harm national security interests.Considering all these views, the appeals court unanimously gave the verdict that Qualcomm has not violated the antitrust laws and had not resorted to any anti-competitive trade practices. The judgment also opined that its business model was rather “chip-supplier neutral”, paving the way for the raft of new agreements, which were already in place, to continue without any legal hassles."""

"OK QCOM with your long term business it is time to bounce like the rest of the Chip companies and most of them can't ""Shine your Shoes""!!! QCOM the 5G power-house!"

"This is why AAPL had to reach a deal. Apple needs to bring 5G to its iPhone sooner than later - intel is exiting the 5G modem market, and it is unlikely AAPL was going to buy from competitor Samsung or Huawei.

Investors in QCOM needs to stop looking forward to APPL revenue lining. QCOM is better off seeking replacement in many other markets. QCOM does not need APPL anymore. Good to hear they are investing in AI.
very interesting. stellar er and guidance-up. but stock drops. this could be a manipulation or just serious hate from MMs.

Once upon a time QCOM had a $250 target price back in the dot-com era. Still waiting. 
Just added some after hours after the good news from the 9th Circuit Court (seems they are tending to agree with QCOM's appeal).
Anyone here know a synonym for “inevitable”?... oh here’s one: QCOM to double digits ASAP
"Qcom down 1%, Nokia up 4% explanation????"
Take my word. In the short term Apple has to bow to Qualcomm. Long term once they build real combo modem things could change.
"This accounts for .65 of the drop today.QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) will begin trading ex-dividend on March 03, 2021. A cash dividend payment of $0.65 per share is scheduled to be paid on March 25, 2021."

no hard feelings here.aapl will come back begging for Qcom business.we know that when it comes to quality and performance INTC does not match Qcom also AAPL phones are overrated and over priced.Braodcom my vote is no.
An observation. 4 of the last 5 trading days in QCOM has shown significant buying in the last 10 minutes of the day. Clear sign of accumulation and a very bullish signal.
"Welp, this may be your last chance to pick up QCOM under $130 before the inevitable stair climb. A solid 22 p/e 5G, mobile computing powerhouse w/divvy to boot..."
Qcom will double. There is no other company's able to compete with their patent technology. if you're in doubt just ask apple. I would not bet against Qcom.
wow the rocket is taking off1
"Looks like AVGO or Broadcom forward statement is helping the the communication chips like QCOM; they expect strong sales going forward and this is good for 5G chip-makers.Broadcom Says Wireless Sales Will Rebound. Broadcom, meanwhile, forecast current fourth-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, encouraged by the upcoming 5G phone launches and strong demand for its data-center chips from the growing remote work market.The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $6.4 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $6.18 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The pandemic-led shift to work-from-home has fired up demand for infrastructure such as data centers at a time when the semi-conductor industry is gearing up for the launch of 5G phones that use higher priced chips.Broadcom posted a 5.6% rise in third-quarter revenue to $5.82 billion, ahead of estimates of $5.76 billion."
"Heart of the sector, Backbone of the Index."
yep. told u so
the biggest joke is that the chips cost next to NOTHING of the total retail price of phone and are the MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT of the cell phone. the whole witch hunt is absurd....
QC should consider charging more for chipsets and reducing the licensing costs however make sure that the ASP net effect is higher. FTC gov involvement is bad to have low brow gov attorneys set the course of your future.... OMG the simple work around is raise the chipset price.
"dividend increased to 0.68$. Results for next 2 years will be mind blowing.. 5G revenue just ""starting"". a big slap to so called analysts who say 5g is done!! loosers!!"
"There are so many spams on this board such as ...pumping market, finance criss, trump with numerous variation... i have been muting them, but new ones are coming everyday and its getting annoying. Is there way to remedy this? Anyone? Anyone here reported as abuse?"
"Let's see if it slams into the 58 resistance again today. Would represent a pretty good move and at this point, a larger gain than the market at-large. So I'm ok if it doesn't blow through it today but it would be disappointing if it approaches 58 again over the next few days and backs off in a definitive way. As I told Manfred Man and his Earth Band, I'm not a believer that in this case, the charts foretell the court decision, but maybe for the short term breaking that resistance would give us some mojo."
"As per this settlement, Apple may not have to pay some billions to Qcom and as Apple's iPhones sell go down because of less demand of high price, at last Qcom would not get that much from Apple and this deal would be in favor of Apple as Apple didn't have to pay to Qcom. Good job, Tim Cook and his company. There are other competitors there for 5G chip maker and there is a case pending against Qcom as well so I am thinking BIG Slide....Be ready, keep watching...."
"Well since we are talking about news outlets, I have never seen market realist have a question in their headline that they actually answer in the article."
I don’t trade options and admittedly don’t understand completely the mechanics of it but noticed higher call volume at the 150 strike going into tomorrow expiration. I would like to think this is bullish sign.
"Keep in mind that this is just the warm up for the major action about to kick off in April between the two companies. An outcome of which has the possibility to force Apple to the negotiating table with potentially huge sums of money changing hands, or to send Qualcomm off licking its wounds with a business model which would appear unsustainable. Obviously the financial ramifications for both companies will be huge."
Looks like ASML is hiring.
Anyone that thinks a company can survive on IP and licensing should research Rambus; they had the IP that all memory chips use and it didn't help them.
"Ok, QCOM, it’s time to wrap up the Huawei licensing deal!"
understanding some of the headlines? Intel sold that chips not their modem business?
Apple +4% up. Good signal that QCOM may follow the same.
I see the Detroit Lions lost yesterday and the Detroit Lions of tech is losing today....

Qualcomm has beat earnings every single quarter ! Is the only company who owns the modem for 5G and is at this price how is that possible ?
Imagine spending years and tons of money to develop these technologies and patents only to have to share them with your competitors who have sat there doing nothing. Where are the rulings against AMZN for not pricing product fairly so that brick and mortar stores could stay in business.. but no instead we hurt a company who has worked to be able to price and license THEIR OWN patents how they want to.

"Mergers & AcquisitionsBroadcom is reportedly preparing to intensify its pursuit of rival chip maker Qualcomm after its initial acquisition effort was rejected.Reuters, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that Broadcom officials are considering adding more stock to its offer in order to entice Qualcomm shareholders. Broadcom also plans to submit a slate of candidates for Qualcomm's board in coming days, who will go before a shareholders meeting in March.Broadcom earlier this month offered to acquire Qualcomm at a value of $70 per share. Although that would be the largest tech merger in history, Qualcomm rejected the offer as too low and said it could present antitrust issues.Prominent Qualcomm stockholders, however, indicated that they could be interested in an offer of at least $80 per share. The value of a new offer from Broadcom was not determined as of last week, Reuters reported.The report added that although Broadcom officials met with Qualcomm investors, Qualcomm itself rejected numerous requests for meetings following the unsolicited bid."
Larry Designing a modem chip is very very difficult. I can see Qualcomm doing their phone. They did it before. Nuvia acquisition is huge for Qualcomm
"So much it is written of the impact of 5G, but we are going thru an entire paradigm shift right now and 5G is more important than ever. How many millions will transition from working at an office to working at home? With your 5G phone, you can tether it to your laptop and work from anyway with 1000 times the speeds you experience today. It will transform entire industries on how their workers work, nevermind entertainment, gaming, smart cars, and so many other applications. Companies have been trying to figure out how working at home will impact productivity, well now they have the data to prove that in many cases it is very positive. I know we have experienced this in our company thus we are not going back until the end of the year if ever. When you look at the cost of having offices, the commute expenses for workers, the wear and tear on their vehicles, and the stress of fighting traffic and reducing pollution, it makes so much sense. And in the middle of it will be QCOM. All we need is a good execution from management and this stock will be a trillion-dollar company in 3 years."
"Just asking, were all the super wealthy people invested in QCOM?"
$137 by Friday!
Remember - management proclaimed that $82/share severely undervalues the company. Top 4 layers of management should all be fired for the dismal stock performance over the past 12 years.
This is worth 165 fair market value. Should be trading 155-157 range. So much manipulation.
Very muted reaction though. Maybe when the official press release comes I hope to goes up at least to 65

Well the demand however just goes on to the next quarter, so watch and learn."
Just for the record. Granted yields going up and NASDAQ crashing - but QCOM in one month will have a PE of 19 at this level. This is a stock growing earnings by 40+% and paying 2% dividends. Many investors are getting a very good deal here.

Very low volume - what a weak showing from the sell side. 5 of last 10 days have been half the average volume. Last time we saw this low of volume was in January prior to the big drop. Low volume ALWAYS precedes a new direction in the stock. Volume is money for the Hedges and Market Makers - when it dries up they will move it up again to get volume and benefit from the rise as they did the drop.
If there is any truth to the story I would expect that any Apple phone not using the Qualcomm antenna module would be sub 6 frequency only. Probably for TMobile/Sprint phones that dont plan on rolling out MM wave.

However, I think Apple will come to regret its acquisition, if my intuition proves correct. In lieu of supporting a $1B+ losing division, Intel decided to sell it to Apple and... in the, if you can't beat them, join them philosophy, acquire / merge with QCOM knowing they'll be free of any regulatory hurdles having sold off its modem business to Apple.

I know what you are thinking, but Apple is sooo cool, They have the cool guy who formed the company,..(no he wasnt cool..he was a consumate #$%$), now Tim Cook in his footsteps, believes the company with their 275 billion in cash, can do absolutely anything they want...like not abiding by the constructs of a legal contract. This is going to be a very expensive lesson for Apple and the outcome of this is going to make Qualcomm even shinier than it was before.."
TheStreet Quant Ratings rates Qualcomm as a Buy with a rating score of A.
One poster on here is touting Qcom will be at $195 after Q2 earnings. He is delusional. This is what the CEO said tonight: Just saw an interview with CEO Amon of Qualcomm. Said they have “line of sight” that supply/demand of chips will be in equal balance in Q4 which means Qcom should be bought or cost averaged down in May/June as market looks 6 months ahead. It was on Bloomberg
"qcom is outperforming SOXX lately, maybe because most are speculating that a stay on ftc case is imminent? also can anyone explain why its taking so long to grant a stay or not? Some industry observers said 4 weeks, then on earning cc, management said any time, that was 3 weeks ago."
LG siding with FTC is no surprise as their chip contract with QCOM is coming to an end and I’m sure they would love to pay less for chips this next go around. Classic backstabbing at its best.
This Board was unable to play the Broadcom bid the way that NXPI played QCOM to drive the share price up. They failed to negotiate with Apple. Might be nice to let the shareholders know what their thoughts are. I don't like this; I have seen the same kind of play on other stocks and some didn't end so well.
"EVERYONE SIMPLY NEEDS TO KEEP ONE THING IN MIND! QCOM owns state of the art and advance 5G! NOT INTEL NOR SKY WORK! WHEN ALL THE CELL PHONE COMPANIES ROLLS OUT TO NEW 5G, ONLY APPLES IS THE ONLY ONE THAT""RE IN DISADVANTAGE POSITION BECAUSE THEY CHOSE INTEL! AND INTEL 5G IS NOWHERE COMPARABLE TO QUALCOM! DON't LISTEN TO THE BAD ANALYST! DO SOME ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS FOR YOURSELF.REMEMBER TO DOUBLE DOWN ON QCOM!"
"it's also of interest to note that apple is already getting a better deal than most of Qualcomm's other licensees in that qualcomm's license agreement is not directly with apple but is instead with apples subcontractors like Foxconn and the royalty rate is charged on the wholesale price of the phone from the contract manufacturer to Apple. . All other Qualcomm license agreements are directly with the likes of Samsung, LG, Motorola and others and the royalty rate is based on the retail price of the phone. So again apple is already getting a better deal than any other handset manufacturer and yet they're taking it to this extreme. It's called greed and bullying. QCOM has been down this road before with Nokia, Erricsson and Broadcom in the early 2000's and won. History will repeat itself because the facts and IPR law are on QCOM's side."
if 5G buildout is over then usa is over bc  will continue to expand 5g & usa be left with buildout being over.  will continue with usa done. sad for usa to acknowledge this (if true).

"Just don't understand why this stock cannot move up, when the whole market is rocking. Is there a shoe that is going to drop? It's got a lock on the 5G market, its Chinese customers are already recovering, CEO was optimistic in his CNBC interview, and yet this stock is stuck in neutral? Is there some news us retail investors are unaware of?"

nuvia is start-up - yes ! not much proven record as per wall street - yes! but aquisition is a game Changer for Qualcomm future - mostly YES. Qualcomm lags with GPU chipset & drivers. it will take on to NVIDIA just like it captured market from Broadcom on RF. A must buy as the wild thing is unleashed along 5G tsunami.
"stock gets pushed down, trades sideways, gets accumulated pre-earnings. always manipulated. I've owned qcom since 1999. I've seen it all. what makes this very manipulated is the fact that the excuse with big caps is that there are too many outstanding shares to move stock up. (never a problem going down) but look at Apple. they just split and stock has no problem climbing. strictly and obviously manipulation. the powers just don't love this company. they can't however ignore the tech so they beat it down. rigged!!!!"
great news!

QCOM shareholders seem overly concerned with AAPL case. AAPL shareholders seldom even mention the case. Somewhere in the middle?
Qcom is at 17 PE forward earnings. This is growing at 25 percent a year This is a steal at these levels. Ignore the people who don’t understand this company. Will bounce to 145/150 in May and by 200 year end.
Anyone here to explain why the stock is going down on the news of Broadcom raising it's bid?

I think that Qualcomm is gonna bullish because Qualcomm is doing good in the chip market the cellphone is very much interested in like Xiaomi they are cheap and the most phone they are selling in with a Qualcomm chip and the new generation fold are coming to the market and 5G so for me there is no reason why I should not buy it in

"Early indications of Iphone 13 usage Qualcomm price target raised to $180 from $175 at KeyBanc KeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised the firm's price target on Qualcomm (QCOM) to $180 from $175 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst sees tailwinds from continued robust demand from China smartphone OEMs and also incremental demand from Honor, indications Qualcomm has been able to qualify its low-band PAD for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 13, and expectations the 5G smartphone market is expected to more than double to 550M units in 2021 from 230M units in 2020. Nonetheless, Vinh believes Qualcomm is struggling to fully meet demand given foundry constraints at Samsung (SSNLF) relative to MediaTek, which could result in relative share loss in 4G and, to a lesser extent, on 5G."

Is it worth holding 100 shares through the unsureness of whether it goes up or down according to the news of buyout or just hold long term.?
Green bean. Green buy-EEN!
I couldnt post it but everyone should watch the interview with CNBC and the Qualcomm CEO.
"Qualcomm CEO should learn from Elon Musk. take advantage of twitter, CNBC, Robinhood accounts, and Fed free money.start talking about robots."
anything under 130 is a great deal
Broadcom's acquisition of Qualcomm will never get regulatory approval around the world. Qualcomm's enabling of Android device manufacturers is to critical to the Chinese and the likes of Intel and Google. in addition leadership in 5 G is to critical to US National Security. For those reasons a foreign entity will never be allowed to acquire Qualcomm
"Market started to realize actual 5G perspectives of Q: Another analyst, Tal Liani, agrees that demand weakness is a temporary issue ahead of the 5G smart phone release. On August 1, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered the price target from $105 to $100. Despite the price target drop, he believes share prices could jump 41% over the next twelve months. “We believe Qualcomm's bull case is unchanged, with global 5G roll outs expected to increase both royalty income and demand for semiconductors beginning in 2020. Press reports suggest that all of Apple's 2020 iPhones will contain Qualcomm's 5G chipset, which could drive a 5G cycle across the entire industry,"" the Merrill Lynch analyst said."
"So what's going to happen if CFIUS refers the matter to the president.Here's a hint. It's what Trump said upon learning that AVGO is redomiciling to the US : ""Trump praised the move, calling Broadcom ""one of the really great, great companies."""
"Some meat and potatoes on this strategic buy-out! WSJ.. Smart move by QCOM!Mobile-phone chip giant Qualcomm Inc. said Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire a chip startup founded by former Apple Inc. engineers, adding to a wave of deals remaking the semiconductor industry.Qualcomm said it plans to buy Nuvia Inc. and use the two-year-old company’s technology in its flagship smartphones, driver-assistance systems, laptops and networking infrastructure. The proposed all-cash transaction is valued at about $1.4 billion. Nuvia’s expertise in designing central processing units, Qualcomm said, would help it boost chip performance and power efficiency—characteristics that are vital to success in the hot 5G-networking market that Qualcomm has made a priority. The San Diego-based chip company is also bolstering its talent pool with the planned acquisition, adding Nuvia’s staff and three founders, Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno. Mr. Williams was lead chip architect at Apple before decamping to start Nuvia two years ago. Mr. Gulati and Mr. Bruno both worked at Apple and Google. The Nuvia team are proven innovators,” said Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president who this month was named to replace Steve Mollenkopf as chief executive at midyear.A wave of deal making across the U.S. semiconductor landscape is transforming the industry amid strong demand for laptops, videogames and data centers. That demand has sent shares in some companies surging, helping companies gain financial muscle to do deals."
this thing will be trading around $150 by end of this month
timmy the “innovator” mr cutting edge...etc who arm twisting vendors to keep margins
Wild guess: QCOM surprises to the upside and gives more guidance forcing Broadcom's bid higher. $78-82/share. Stock price goes to mid 70's by close on Friday.
"What Qualcomm really needs to do to strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Qualcomm (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Qualcomm just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Slowly rotating ownership into Qualcomm. Morning run-up followed by profit taking not unusual.
"Qualcomm is a heavyweight... I never understood the bashers. Intel tried... and it goes to show, Qualcomm is the best! They made aapl crawl for it...."
$123.20 is the gap from March 8th. I expect this to be filled within the next couple days. PE contraction
Surprised by the sharp fall as there don’t seem to be many shorts. My best guess is that market makers have “shaken the tree” after taking some profits for managed accounts higher up. They know where major institutions wish to buy - the punters who are worried are completely in the dark. That’s how markets work !
"Successful investors are good at find next big thing. Now QCOM is the one before your eye. Although the stock was up 75% last year, now PE ratio is just 32. Its EPS growth is close to 100%, which should support a fair PE ratio at 60. So the stock is almost 100% discounted. 5G is just getting started. In next 5 years, QCOM could become a trillion company. Folks, you have to understand that QCOM is in a position of FANNG stocks (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT,..) 5 years ago. Do miss this big opportunity of getting really rich."
I worked at Qualcomm and I can tell you that company is horribly managed. The company has so much fat that they can get rid of half the engineers and still meet all their target deadlines! Broadcomm management will show them how to cut cost and grow earnings so that the stock price will grow 500% in 5 years like what happened to Broadcomm stock. I am definitely voting my shares for the Broadcomm directors.
I hope the 9th Circuit is reading it very carefully !!!https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/03/2002109302/-1/-1/0/DIB_5G_STUDY_04.03.19.PDF
You still think it will take Apple 5 years to develop its own 5G modem? I say 2 years or 3 years max.
Well now. Qcom is just saying that they feel they have a right to charge for technology that is very expensive to research and create. their tech is the reason that you can move five feet to the left or right and not have your call dropped. and Apple believes this fee ( like 9 dollars a head) is too much for the tech that goes in their phones that they charge us 1000 dollars a head for. Hmmmmmm what's wrong here?
"Great piece of news from latest Wall Street Journal article... Below....With the addition of revenue from the Apple settlement, Qualcomm expects revenue in the current third quarter to jump to between $9.2 billion to $10.2 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, total revenue was $5.6 billion.Like about double, and I bet the low balled it!!"
Q4 price targets please.
"Apple modem development is old news. They spent $1B to buy Intel's modem IP well over a year ago, so of course they will work on it. But Intel spent upward of $5B on its modem development and failed. By the time Apple will have something workable Q will already be onto 6G. I always regarded Apple's Intel modem play as negotiation/insurance tactic, no more than that. Someone is trying to spin it"
"Low PE, High Payout Adds to QCOM Stock AppealTo be sure, even if such a deal takes some time, other factors make QCOM stock worth the wait. Despite the much-higher earnings projection for fiscal 2020, the forward PE comes in at just 15.7x. That multiple will bring an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.5% that year. Going further out, Wall Street projects average annual profit increases of 27.05% per year over the next five years.Furthermore, Qualcomm will make it worth it for investors to wait for the 5G revolution. Qualcomm’s current dividend stands at $2.48 a share, which takes the yield to just over 2.9%. While that pales in comparison to the 4.3% yield before the price spike, it still comes in well above S&P 500 index averages. QCOM has also increased this payout every year for the last eight years. If these payout hikes remained safe during the recent years of struggle for QCOM stock, they should continue once consumers begin buying 5G-compatible devices.Final Thoughts on QCOM StockFollowing its settlement with Apple, QCOM stock again trades in a range as the company faces its next battle. The magnitude of QCOM’s post-settlement move, coupled with a mixed earnings report, may weigh on the equity for now. Moreover, the company relies on China for the majority of its revenue. Such concerns could bring the same stagnation to Qualcomm stock that the shares faced during the Apple dispute.However, much like Apple, China may also have to agree to a trade settlement to move forward in 5G. Once the China situation becomes more settled and manufacturers begin to sell 5G-compatible phones in earnest, QCOM stock will have nowhere to go but up.Qualcomm Inc. shares were trading at $85.40 per share on Friday afternoon, up $1.62 (+1.93%). Year-to-date, QCOM has gained 51.81%, versus a 15.44% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.QCOM currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of B (Buy), and is ranked #15 of 90 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip category."
"the ftc lawsuit is all about whether qualcomm can charge royalty fee based on device level or chip level. As long as qualcomm holds device level licensing, it is a win. Tim cook called it 'double dipping', the whole telecom sector has been doing it for over 20 years, even nokia which doesnt sell chip to smartphone still collects royalty fee.I do not think judge is able to break a 20 years tradition, it will be a chaos. Imagine you go to a big theme park, instead of paying a main entrance fee, you just pay for what you ride, sounds very fair right? but what about guest experience?"
Honestly is it still a buy now? Can someone advise?

"Barrons also picked up this story. Regardless of the impact on apple of not delivering 5G, the seeming lack of concern on their part and/or their apparently poor supply chain management doesn't bode well at all PR-wise. Apple's move to fifth-generation wireless technology, or 5G, for its iPhone may take longer than some investors expect, according to UBS.The back story. Apple (ticker: AAPL) shares have rallied 23% so far this year through Tuesday as investor sentiment regarding its strategic shift to services has improved.Last week, the company unveiled an array of new paid services such as Apple TV+, a video-subscription offering; Apple Arcade , for gaming; and Apple News+, for news and magazines.But some analysts are also looking forward to the potential big upgrade cycle from a 5G-enabled iPhone in 2020. Samsung has already announced a 5G-enabled phone, which will be released this year.The shift to 5G is tremendously important to the technology industry. Analysts expect 5G to deliver 10 to 40 times the current speed of 4G LTE networks. Its lower latency promises to make possible new applications from augmented reality to cloud gaming.What's new. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri on Tuesday said Apple may not be able to launch a 5G iPhone by next year.There is ""increasing potential that AAPL may not be able to ship a 5G iPhone for 2020,"" he wrote. ""Barring settlement w/QCOM in the next few months, field work suggests Apple is increasingly in jeopardy of being unable to ship a 5G iPhone in 2020."" Apple is embroiled in a patent dispute with Qualcomm (QCOM) over technology used in the company's phones. Apple stock was 0.5% higher at $194.89 early on Wednesday. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for commentThe analyst said he thinks Intel (INTC) won't be ready to produce a 5G modem for Apple by 2020, and that he doubts Samsung will want to sell Apple a 5G modem.Looking ahead. Arcuri reaffirmed his Buy rating and $215 price target for Apple shares, saying the smartphone maker will still be able to increase its iPhone sales over the long run due to demand from people seeking to replace their phones.Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.com"

"@qcom Anyone know how much in license royalties qcom will receive anyway from apple if apple develops its own modem chips? It should be significant, unless apple tries again to not pay and dispute qcom IP rights. Wonder how much qcom makes per unit when it sells apple modem chip, how much qcom makes per unit in royalty when it simply licenses its 5G patents."
"QCom finally wins a case against AAPL, yea. Seems politically motivated ,however. QCOM R&D is second to none except maybe NVDA but its management and legal teams have not lived up to their part"
"Why would you not hold this stock longer term with QCOM essentially owning 5G modem business while leading all 5G competition at least one full generation for the next 4-5 years ?!The next 5G super cycle of upgrade for iphone and android install base will mostly be using QCOM 2/3/4/5G MSM/MDM. Guys this is not just a modem chip we are talking about here, this is the entire 5G module, complete with optimized RF front end, PMIC, antenna etc. It ain't gonna be cheap. (SKYWORKS, QRVO and AVGO won't be so happen here) * Qcom will be selling these 5G modules like hot cakes plus the % royalty as per license agreements for that super cycle * Even if Judge Koh rules negatively, QCOM will prevail on appeal eventually due to FTC's super weakened arguments. * Even if Apple eventually goes vertical in 5-6 years with their own integrated A+ modem SOC, they'll need to pay Q, ZTE/Huawei/Sammy/Erickson/Nokia royalty for each 5G unit sold. * I doubt APPL will ever try this contract negging, litigation bully stunt again, Tim Apple might contemplate a revenge, but the APPL board won't let this fiasco happen again. So you impatient folks need to chill out, stop worrying about a pull-back to 75 or what not in the short term and look a tad further into the clear blue horizon."
The settlement will consist of APPLE paying Qualcomm to settle. Big uncertainty lifted on Qualcomm to move forward.

As I am invested in $NIO I watched the Nio Day presentation. Seems they are going to use best of breed vendors for their new ET7 car. ( $NVDA $QCOM ). Do you think they will use Skyworks as well?

Chipsets are ""much stronger than expected"" for March, but the company guided for a drawdown in June, while royalties were guided down for March and June, Moore tells investors. While the net result is that his EPS forecast comes down ""slightly"" for the year, Moore still sees the potential for tailwinds to resume, he tells investors.Qualcomm price target raised to $150 from $127 at Deutsche Bank - Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore raised the firm's price target on Qualcomm to $150 from $127 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares following last night's ""strong beat/raise.""

Eventually other phone makers will follow $AAPL lead and move away from $QCOM unless the pricing structure changes.

"Interesting that we are now bouncing around the price just prior to the re-release of the old new about AAPL chip development. I stick by my prediction that we will be volatile within the current range ($154-$162) until the week results are released. Results are due mid week and I predict the price to start its’ rise Monday morning, Feb 1. As long as there are no quick policy implementation surprises by the Biden administration prior, I am comfortable we will see fantastic results as well as a spike in SP immediately after earnings are released. As always there will be an over-reaction and quick correction on Friday, however we will be over $175 at the end of trading on Feb 5. While it may be getting harder to hold at these evaluations, and the ride is bumpy, that is what you get with a stock that has moved up so quickly, and has a history of disappointing SP reactions to good or great results. I must admit that I am potentially looking to lock in Somme profits between $175 and $200!"

So a few weeks ago Steve M CEO of QC demenstrated his lack of experience in the CEO roll. He said “we are on. The door step of a resolution”. Then ceo of Apple denied this demonstrated they Steve is out of his league and needs to be rained in. If any employee made this inaccurate statement they would of been let go ASAP. Even if they were on the door step one would think a CEO would not say a word and let negotiations move forward. When are the shareholders going to rise up with this behavior?
how long before Qcom rally starts?if the Federal govt save Qcom surely thier stock has value and it should be considered a national defense stock now.110 is my price.
last time when Erickson caved qcom went up 3000 percent i dont see that again but 300 tp 400 percent is possible
curious why Intel is NOT MONOPOLISTIC in the PC market but Qcom is allegedly a monopoly in wireless?

"Raymond James upgraded Qualcomm to strong buy from outperform""Raymond James said it has increased confidence that Qualcomm will see greater value ahead of 5G and after the Apple settlement.“While we had already been positive on the stock ahead of the settlement due to what we believed was the company’s intrinsic value, our upgrade reflects greater confidence that the mechanism is now in place to unlock that value, after the Apple settlement and ahead of the 5G cycle. Based on details from the release, we believe Apple’s licensing payment amounts to $7.50/phone, precisely in line with our view following the settlement announcement - and we believe very close to what Apple had been paying (net of rebates) prior to the dispute. In the near-term, that’s being offset by China market weakness (which QCOM believes may reflect a stall ahead of 5G phone availability), and higher expenses (which will improve as legal costs come down). Longer-term, our estimates assume $7.50 in earnings power once they begin to ship Apple chipsets, which can move to ~$8 after a Huawei settlement, presenting an attractive valuation even after the stock’s recent move. ”https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/calls-of-the-day-uber-qualcommvisa-estee-lauder-more.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
"Apple owes Qcom $8 billion + interest just based on the signed contract obligations. There is no way I can see Apple can escape that in the court. Even if the court rules that going forward Qcom must license per cost of the chip, they are still obligated to honor the contract that they have signed. Then there is this payment for damages which is normally 3 times the amount owed. So if Apple loses the April court it could owe Qcom close to $30 billion dollars for withholding payments and damages for breach of the contract. That is almost 40% of Qcom market cap."

So, $80 five years ago. 10% return is $130, 12% is $140. Seems reasonable for one of the greatest technology companies in human history.... did I mention 5G is the future?"
Well you didn’t think she was gonna stay red forever did you?Back to greener pastures... 
can FTC appeal? what is the likelihood of that (appeal) happening?
"Qualcomm is the next revolution for 5G . I see $100 , did you?"
"It seems quite clerly that most of today sellers do not understand how IP works. Even with the Apple's own ""efficient"" 5G chip, which is very unlikely imho, Apple will still have to pay Q licencing fees for using Apple's own chips implementing Q patented inventions (which were granted to Q more than 5 years ago). If Apple wants to compete and not depend on Q in future (now it is not possible), they have to invent a new technology (6G, 7G etc.) and go through all the standard setting organizations to prove that their tech is better than any prior art tech"
Cascend Securities increased their target price on shares of QUALCOMM from $175.00 to $185.00 and gave the stock a buy rating in a research note on Tuesday.

"Money is going into Energy today, QRVO reports after the close also and they are down almost 5, very weird action in these two stocks.

Remember, GOOG was up 30 points before they reported earnings yesterday. We are the last to know"

"Still cheap, get in before the $AAPL 5g phone unveiling on October 13th; will be trading over $130 post announcement and by this time next year $200 (so that means, 12 month price target) is not an unreasonable expectation assuming all current expectations are met."

"Kevin, NXPI did not hit it out of the park. They matched estimates at $2.21 and sales also. Silver lining here is that they’re flat in AH as to where if QCOM does hit it out of the park, has a good path for a big day. They need to do $1.82-1.85 and guide for similar to get this to $155 in my opinion"
Bought 1000 shares at 152.05 after hours. Thought earnings were excellent. Will see over next 2-3 days. Also bought 1000 shares mvrl which is down in sympathy.
"This is a day where it would be nice to see Qualcomm separate from the pack and be up 2% to show it is looked at differently, and perhaps at some point in the future it will, just not today. Those are the days that led Nvidia to where it is today from the past five years"

"I will guarantee you that apple is in some way behind broadcom's attempt at acquiring Qualcomm. what Qualcomm does by constantly and inexpensively enabling Fierce competition against Apple is threatening to Apple. I would not be surprised if Apple didn't already have some kind of an agreement in place with Hok Tan that contemplates broadcom's successful acquisition of Qualcomm. Tim Cook and Apple have no moral compass these days. they're happy to steal other people's IPR, evade taxes, use child labor and treat their suppliers like indentured servants."

"From JP Morgan upgrade....Overall, Chatterjee expects Qualcomm’s smartphone baseband chip sales to reach $18.5 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $14.7 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends next September. He sees 5G-driven revenue making up about two-thirds of that $18.5 billion total.We are talking about big money here folks!!!!!"
Probably Apple!
What is it with all this span on this board? Way to go Yahoo stopping this nonsense. Anyway right now for us the only thing to do is wait for earnings because that will set the stage for the next leg up. Stay long and strong and you will be rewared. I have a lot of faith in this company.
"Anyone else thinking this is totally insane? How can a $100 plus dollar stock drop 1/4 of its value in such a short time? We back at levels when we heard the case was resolved and there was that quick jump into the high $70s. It's like someone yelled fire in a theater? So what do we do? Expect more pain? A further drop into the $60s (my thoughts- a normalization/no pumpers), or buy like there is no tomorrow? What are you doing with qcom?"
"QCOM has been a great buy under $50, going back 5 years has happened many times. I always started looking when div yield hit >4%, which is really nice as the div keeps increasing every year. I'm now early retired, and divs are my paycheck. The market and stock prices are impossible to predict short term. Dividends are easy to predict."

Wow! Check this comment on QCOM from Seeking Alpha article...Just to give some perspective how much ahead of the pack Qualcomm is in mobile AI department: Apple's M1 (notebook 7+W TDP) processor only has 11TOps of AI performance while Snapdragon 888 has 26TOps at 5W TDP power envelope. The 865 last year already had 15TOps. They are so ahead of the pack in power efficiency that in 2021 they are commercially venturing into data center AI and autonomous driving where they deliver over 2x AI inferencing performance per Watt on the same 7nm process node used by competition like NVDA/INTC/AM

If the ""patent-licensing business"" preserve in the US, then I expect Apple would have very weak arguments against Q."
Lets take bets on what QCOM gets to before the holiday.
QCOM is the best company in the world for 5G. No argueThe results are fantastic This is a share to hold for long term. The fluctuation is to throw weak hands.Any deep is an opportunity to buy
QCOM board should be arrested for grand theft. Shareholders could have had $82/share - now stock is almost 40% lower.

"Hold tight, folks. The guidance is way more important than whatever the numbers were for the quarter they're reporting on. If you look at the analyst estimates under the 'analysis' section above, you'll see the 5G ramp really starts next quarter, so that's what I believe the focus will be. We do know the 5G iPhone is due in October and the TSM numbers last week could be bullish for QCOM. We should be north of $100 if all goes according to plan. Good luck all."
Daily bottom right here at 86.14. Just added 50 more. Stay long my friends.
anyone watching the after market what is happening lol
Please don’t fall for the hedge fund hit job that got put on the market today. Classic move to try to get tech stocks lower.
"Love the comments. Let's sum up-Sellers only have nefarious reasons for selling, its always an overreaction on the sell side. Buyers are always pure, they never overreact."
"Much less chatter on the message board than usual. Wondering if this last Naz correction lost some investors. Possible margin calls and panic selling. If that did happen, then this could be seen as capitulation and maybe we finally move forward from here? Who knows!"
Good opportunity to own 5G leader stock. This will eventually pay off
Congratulations to shorts! They called it and won.

"Is this really ""new news"" or just a head fake to manipulate QCOM's lofty price?? I'm leaning towards the latter. Remember people, QCOM and AAPL still have an existing licensing agreement for SIX more years. Another fact to consider, AAPL's purchase from INTC to develop their own chip is iffy at best; WHY would INTC sell if INTC couldn't be successful? AAPL is said to be building their own team and where do you think these ""rocket scientists"" are located??? Think about that folks. Additionally, plans for 6G are already in place so by time AAPL comes up with their own chip, it will more than likely be too late as technology continues to move forward at the speed of, well, light!!! I'm adding to my QCOM position and still waiting for a lower entry point to add to my AAPL position!!"
"At $167 I said a hundred times QCOM will fill gap @ $130. Sorry, I was wrong, went to $120!"

"WOW, what the heck happened to QCOM??!! It's broken through ALL of its daily SMA, 5, 20, 50, 100 and 200!!RSIs still indicates more selling may occur. QCOM knocks it out of the park two quarters in a row and shareholders are rewarded with huge sell offs ..."
"QCOM is the biggest deal out there right now in stocks. PE and PEG at levels you would expect to see with a 5% to 10% growth company. QCOM is on the front end of a huge growing market, expanding their TAM into areas outside of mobile and they have a huge moat. Anything under 170 right now will gain you a great return in just a year. We haven't even heard about 2022 yet - but just looking at 2021 earnings which have been forecast, this should be 200 to 240 by end of year."
Today is the last day the FTC can appeal to the full 9th circuit court. That is all.
could intel be forming a basis to make an initial bid for qcom...The ex CFO is a great place to start.....just saying...
wow really hammering the nasdaq. this summer qcom will be 180 or 190...?
"Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Joseph Moore, see Qualcomm benefiting from smartphone demand and Lam benefiting from a bright long-term outlook.The analysts raised the rating for both companies to overweight from equal weight. They lifted their share-price target for Qualcomm to $102 from $83 and for Lam to $334 from $253.As for Qualcomm, “we see smartphone demand improving through the year, with rising average selling price as we transition to 5G,” the analysts wrote in a report"
NAS correction is well over!!!
Could some of the shareholders who sold this morning at the open (2 million shares) tell us what thread or message they were reacting to that made them so such a thing? Its pretty obvious APPLE could be behind this offer as it gets the QCOM IP regimen out of their way permanently. Doesw anyone really think Broadcom and Apple didn't discuss this acquisition in advance? Why sell out when the offer is about to go up? IMHO
bought step 100 call after early morning dip. good luck everyone
Great buy until at least $160! Stop gambling and selling hoping for lower entry points.
$120 this week.

"AVGO announced a rather large dividend increase, 72% to 1.75 per share quarterly. Now just need to wait for all the analyst to ask question about QCOM deal on the call."
QCOM shareholders will take the power away from the entrenched Board on March 6th. Vote blue.
"All good tech stocks took a hit yesterday. Many were already a little frothy (NVIDIA, AMD, and TSM) - but QCOM went down with the rest regardless of valuation. We had a well respected analyst come out with a BUY rating and explained that QCOM valuation was a bargain at this point considering the coming quarters and their position in 5G. Result is this market needs to finish its correction as this is how the hedges make such big returns and swings up and down - not sure how long this will take but everyone just needs to close their eyes and let these gyrations pass as this is what the market does. If you don't sell you won't be fleeced, it is as simple as that. Buy good valuation stocks and you can easily ride these out - as smart money will use anything in the news to drive stocks in one direction or the other (right now is treasury yields which is a joke as it is not wide spread - was semi shortage, etc.). As soon as this quarter is over you will be hearing of how booming the economy is ..."
"Interesting that all todays potentially positive news for Qualcomm about 5G, TSMCs seeing increased smartphone order increase, and that Apple may not have in 2021 a 5G iPhone, are absent from the news feed!?! You only find the news of the CFO who switched to Intel!"
"Forward looking theme is 5G. As QCOM ceo said in his earnings call, the softness in China is “the lull before the storm”. Ericsson engineer on CNBC talked about the need to equip 350,000 towers with 5G modules and antennas. In addition 650,000 additional towers need to be added for the 5G infrastructure. I’m betting on Apple, Xilinx n QCOM to benefit in the next few yrs."
Nobody can deny this is having another underperforming day in comparison to many other semi stocks by far. This has been horrific
"The UK government looked set to begin the process of removing Huawei from networks in the country and ban operators from purchasing new equipment, after a review into the vendor found severe security issues, The Sunday Times reported. It reported a review by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) deemed Huawei’s products unsecure, and ministers are likely to approve policy in the next two weeks which would see a ban on the purchase of new Huawei equipment implemented at the end of the year. Should the policy come into force, Huawei kit would be removed from existing parts of 5G networks by 2026 or 2027, which would be followed by its 4G and 3G involvement. UnprecedentedThe NCSC’s decision represents a major shift from earlier in the year, when the UK approved operators to use Huawei equipment in non-sensitive parts of their networks, limited to 35 per cent. However, in May, NCSC confirmed it was conducting a fresh review into the vendor to assess the impact of tightened US sanctions around the use of domestic components in overseas chip production. The Sunday Times reported the NCSC found the US move “fundamentally changes” the situation, prompting the policy changes, which could be announced officially at the end of this month. An unnamed government source told The Sunday Times the US sanctions are “unlike anything we’ve ever seen before”. “Huawei is in a position without any easy fixes or loopholes. This fundamentally changes the calculation. The impacts are so severe that, given the need to give clarity to industry, there will be decision taken and parliament will be notified this month,” the source said. The shift in stance on Huawei would represent a major victory for both the US, which lobbied for its allies to ban the vendor, and certain MPs within the government, who maintained pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take a harder line on the company. Huawei has protested its innocence since news of NCSC’s review in May, arguing it posed no security risk and insisting it operates independently from the Chinese government."

"Apple's (AAPL) transition to in-house basebands is not a new risk for Qualcomm (QCOM), but is increasingly coming into focus with ramp in investments from Apple, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee tells investors in a research note. The recent announcement from Apple to increase its investments in the Munich facility as well as feedback from the supply chain is driving an increased focus on the ""well understood risk"" around the potential substitution of Qualcomm's basebands on iPhones with an internally developed solution, says the analyst. He believes this will remain on overhang on Qualcomm but keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $170 price target. Relative to the analyst's fiscal 2022 earnings per share estimate of $8.60 for Qualcomm, Chatterjee estimates the earnings power for the company is closer to $7.00 per share when excluding Apple revenues from QCT. His ""base case"" remains for a multi-year transition across the iPhone portfolio, with the potential introduction of a new baseband solution in non-mmWave markets."

Amazing news for Qcom!!! Judge will rule in Qcom favor against apple in April!! So he said damages that apple will have to pay Qcom limits for only the time after Qcom entered with the lawsuit!! So its clear Qcom will win some money!!
CPI data is calculated YOY. Last year both CPI and PPI were actually negative relative to the year before. So yes we are higher but much of the increase is just “reflation” back to where we were before the pandemic.

Huawei’s R&D budget hits $14bn as next-generation networks arrivehttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/11c61c36-d9eb-3f89-8796-3024a5799407/%5B%24%24%5D-huawei%E2%80%99s-r%26d-budget-hits.htmlHuawei spends a record 13bn on R&D. Meantime Apple's greed is going to destroy QCOM R&D just to fill their exec's pockets with bigger bonuses. QCOM R&D once the prized jewel who invented every thing we enjoy now on 3G/4G and fueled the growth of the smart phones making Apple rich will not survive without getting the intellectual property royalties -- which is by the way contrary to what apple let everyone to believe is very cheap ($18) because it is based on the price that iphone manufactures sell to apple not what apple sells to the customers. At the end it will be the American greed that will destroy us not the Chinese.

I have a question: why did Huawei settle And pay 1.8 billion to Qcom? Is it because they want to use there 5G chips in future? Was there a mention in earnings call of a supply agreement like the Apple settlement? To put in prospective Huawei sold over 40 million phones and Apple is under 8 . Who is largest phone Manufacturer in the world? Huawei? (Samsung close behind). .. so have the analysis added the increase in sales for QCom with the new #1 Cell phone supplier in the world .. we need to ask about a supply agreement with Huawei. Apple signed 5 year deal?? Any thoughts on this?
I doubt any semi related names are green today. aside from NVEC.
MediaTek delivered a strong guidance. Qualcomdey is going to lose big this time.

When WIIL APPLE PAY UP ?????????????????????
"QCOM has been hostage to the mobile phone handsets for so long - analysts covering them only know the game which they have played for years. Cyclical, inventory, declining demand, when is the next launch, etc. QCOM is redefining the playing field and today's call was evident the analysts didn't what to ask or say... they were stuck on MM Wave, RF, Phones, QTL, etc. NOBODY asked questions like what areas of IOT ARE EXPANDING! Really incredible to me... the highest growth segment 20% Q over Q with a $1B to boot... yet nobody asked ...so what is driving this demand? No talk of factories, networking, healthcare, military - really amazing. Either totally missing the boat or more likely just too ignorant and therefore only ask what they know - phones. Incredulous when you really think about it."
I know what the hot chip stock for the next two years is....look atop this screen. Funny how what was old becomes new.
should close low green to red tomorrow just like amd
it looks like big boys are buying large blocks at a time. they drive it down to buy cheap... hope everyone got some around 124 or less

"Quite some hype reg. LG, as they filed a support letter in favor of the FTC motion to keep the court order intact. Qualcomm filed a motion to stay the enforcement May 28, FTC did the opposite yesterday. LG supports the FTC. Time for the court to come up with a solution quickly. If the Court would agree with FTC ( which most likely will happen), Qualcomm would seek a stay from the 9th circuit within 7 days of the Courts ruling. So there is no news, apart from LG supporting the FTC. Personally I think it speaks for itself: the FTC wants to keep the courts ruling because of public interest. LG seems to represent the public interest. What a disgrace."
This is not a surprise news at all. All players knew this merger was not going to happen. That was why qcom was traded in the low $60s while the offer was $80s. This is an opportunity to buy more ata discounted price.

"Firefox Beta for Native Windows on Snapdragon Now Available""In December at Qualcomm’s Tech Summit, the company announced that it would be bringing a range of software applications natively to its Windows on Snapdragon platform.

I looked back to about October 2017 and there has not been one single share acquired by a QCOM insider other than shares acquired through the deferred stock option plan that does not require a cash payment. If the market is undervaluing QCOM every single day and AVGO's offer is an insult, why aren't these insiders buying shares?"

Amazing!!Qualcomm's Breakout May Be Imminent $QCOMhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4252351
Qualcomm processors are featured in Vuzix' augmented reality Smart Glasses.
"this is nvda 2.0now everyone is paying, and less lawsuit expenses, apple in bed, i am looking at eps 7-8 next year,and grow 15+% annually from there, 2 years from now, i think most smart cars will be equipped with 5g chips.i was calling for 100 today before earning report came out, now i am calling for 200 by end of next year."
"QCOM and MSFT are getting hammered for no reason. One is a leader in cloud the other in 5G technology and yet they are struggling to break out. I don't get why stocks like Tesla, Apple, Amazon, NVDA, etc continue to hit new highs and these two are just stuck in the mud after great earnings."
What is going on with this?
"If NFLX can goes up to $550, there’s no reason why QCOM can not goes up to $200.STRONG BUY!"
"Not particularly impressed with today's price action. Street seems to be saying ""Job well done, but now go back to the wood shed."""
"If AAPL wants to enter the 5G market, they will be FORCED to pay royalties to QCOM, the company with the largest portfolio of 5G patents, especially components with small form factor which save batery life. QCOM announced their royalties price of $16.24 for every 5G mobile phone sold. There will be cross-licensing and volume discounts which will lower that figure but QCOM will greatly benefit financially once 5G launches worldwide early next year. Apple is not special, they will not get a discounted rate to what QCOM is charging other mobile companies no matter how much they cry to the FTC. QCOM is collaborating with 18 telecoms and 20 manufacturers worldwide to launch 5G-enabled products beyond mobile devices next year. The opportunity for QCOM is staggering and will easily lead to annual EPS growth of over 20% for many years. AAPL had better wise up and make peace with QCOM or it will get left in the dust next year. Iphones make up over 60% of AAPL's total revenues and they could go the way of the dinosaur without QCOM's 5G technology(which came about from many billions spent on R&D)"
I heard about QCOM the other day on (http://Pick-stocks.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
AAPL dropped 14 bucks after the best ER they've ever had and the following week bounced back 9$. I expect a similar trend here.
"https://twitter.com/JamesValvo/status/1293221267726839808Ninth Circuit reverses district court in FTC v. Qualcomm, concludes no anti-trust violation."
QCOM now has over 16 billion dollars of debt. 81% of their capital structure is debt! With the money they have purchased a lot of over priced stock. Some of this purchase has been a cya purchase by management. It is way overdone and will catch up with the company.

Michael Walkley on Monday reaffirmed his Buy rating for Qualcomm shares, saying Huawei accounts for a small portion of the company’s business.“Our current Qualcomm estimates include minimal contributions from Huawei,” he wrote. “Despite the near-term uncertainty from the Huawei ban to the wireless infrastructure and handset markets, we believe Qualcomm remains an attractive investment opportunity.The analyst is optimistic about Qualcomm’s ability to generate strong sales from its leadership in fifth-generation wireless technology.The shift to 5G is tremendously important to the semiconductor and telecom industries. Analysts expect 5G to deliver 10 to 40 times the current speed of 4G LTE networks. Its lower latency promises to enable new applications from self-driving vehicles to cloud gaming.Looking ahead. The analyst reaffirmed a price target of $105 for Qualcomm shares, representing a potential gain of 35% from the current price.“We believe Qualcomm is well positioned to benefit with increasing smartphone market share with leading Android OEMs as 5G smartphone shipments ramp entering 2020 and beyond,” he wrote.Get smart think long term and be rewarded!!"

"This is retail investors that don't understand the technology behind 5G, selling. And then it's Apple right? These retail investors think everything Apple does is a success. Not so. QCOM has the patents in this technology, it has a huge lead, and is already working on the next generation of chips that put Apple behind before the starting gate. But what everyone is missing is this. Apple can't afford to put out an inferior product so in 6 years if they can't bring a chip that is as good or BETTER than QCOMs (which is highly unlikely) they will need to resign with them.Intel has a huge R&D department on chip development, they invested over 5 billion in this technology and failed. They sold to Apple 20 cents on a dollar spent. Think about that. I think Apple will use what comes out of that division as a much less expensive solution on wireless chips on gadgets they will come out in the future but the high-end modems they put on their future best and most expensive phones will continue to belong to QCOM."
"QCOM as % account value = 170%, including long calls, 60% without calls. Only live once."

"Qualcomm’s Rf Business Is Under the Street’s Radar, Says 5-Star Analyst As the largest mobile chipmaker in the world, Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries of the upcoming 5G cycle. However, there’s a particular segment of Qualcomm’s business that gets less attention, but has gradually become more prominent. Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland recently spoke to Qualcomm’s resident RF expert, to discuss an “often-misunderstood piece of Qualcomm’s business model.” Qualcomm’s RF front end business – the components that turn the information into radio signals – grew by 50% year-over-year in the first quarter. Rolland estimates the segment makes up 10% of Qualcomm’s overall business, amounting to what is now a run-rate of $600 million. Looking further down the line, in the long term, Qualcomm sees RF making up 20% of the company’s business. The company has expanded its RF “revenue base” significantly, with recent technology advances in parts, such as power amplifiers, switches and antenna tuners. Furthermore, some 5G networks will be powered by mmWave – the tech which makes it possible to move massive chunks of data at high speed over unused high-frequency bands. Qualcomm’s “integrated approach” gives it a competitive advantage as it provides the performance required to “meet complexity challenges at high frequencies.” But 5G is not the only opportunity for the RF business, as Qualcomm is making strides in 4G, too. 5G is based on legacy 2G/3G/4G networks and Qualcomm has been able “to inherit legacy bands when winning 5G platforms at some customers.” Summing up, the 5-star analyst said, “Qualcomm has defined the cutting-edge cellular standard by consistently ‘moving the goal posts’ in baseband capabilities for the last two decades. Every time a competitor matches Qualcomm’s technology, they quickly add important new ‘table-stakes’ features… We continue to believe the RF opportunity for Qualcomm is generally underappreciated by the Street.” Rolland keeps a Positive rating (i.e. Buy) on QCOM, and raises the price target from $95 to $105. The implication for investors? Potential upside of 23% from current levels. (To watch Rolland’s track record, click here) https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-rf-business-under-street-212037960.html"

Of course this is all in addition to the 400 billion in new tariffs for China’s stubbornness and deaf ear..

All this Zacks and Bloomberg SB (turn the letters) is comments that will not affect QCOM's Snapdragon chips. There is no way 5G chips will be re-programmable as it states in this latest article from Bloomberg & Zacks. The Snapdragon chip is where most of their money will be made.These writers are talking about pie in the sky Tech stuff that will never happen and if does it will not adversely affect QCOM.
I would love for INTC to buy QCOM (and drop NXPI). Epic.
"Another thought... If QCOM sees the votes rolling in and they realize they are beat, do they finally just throw in the towel and enter into negotiations with AVGO? They can still save the shareholders money and axe NXPI. $82 is better than $79, and ultimately the large shareholders want that to happen. Plus it saves them the embarrassment of not closing NXPI."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing in Beijing she wasn?t aware of any deal the firm may have reached with the U.S.?The Parties have agreed upon a path forward that would resolve this litigation without the need for contested briefing,? according to the filing, which didn?t state whether the agreement included any conditions for removal.

Its designation as a Communist Chinese Military Company by the U.S. early this year had no bearing on fundamentals, but preceded a 15% drop in Xiaomi?s share price since it was announced, even as mainland investors increased ownership by 27%.-- Matthew #$%$erman and Nathan Naidu, analystsClick here for the researchXiaomi, which makes robot vacuum cleaners, electric bikes and wearable devices alongside smartphones, had been an unexpected target for the Trump administration. Co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Lei Jun more than 10 years ago, with U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. as one of the earliest investors, the company has insisted it?s not owned or controlled by the Chinese military.A U.S. court in March sided with Xiaomi in the lawsuit and placed a temporary halt on the ban. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras said at the time Xiaomi was likely to win a full reversal of the ban as the litigation unfolds and issued an initial injunction to prevent the company from suffering ?irreparable harm.?Read more: Xiaomi Jumps After U.S. Trading Ban on Phone Maker Is HaltedThe agreement marks a rare victory for China?s technology giants caught in the crosshairs of the U.S. government, as the two nations clashed over issues ranging from trade to human rights and Hong Kong?s rule. Trump had signed an order in November barring American investment in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what the U.S. has described as abusive business practices. The order against Xiaomi, alongside a handful of other Chinese firms, was issued in the waning days of his administration."

Apple has 70% of its sale from only one product. This should be very scary for Apple shareholders. Tim Cook may be risking way too much for a one trick pony company by putting all his eggs in one basket and not to be prepared for the 5G. And all this really for saving $7 in royalties??! Even if Apple makes its own modem it is still not going to be free? They will need to build a huge R&D facility and spend nearly $5 billion in R&D to sustain the future development. Frankly I think Tim Cook has lost it. With no new innovations in the pipelines he may be soon remembered as the guy who broke Apple

"Browsing the amicus briefs in FTC vs QCOM was interesting. Against QCOM are either phone makers that don't want to pay license fees (obviously) or chip makers who have inferior products or could not bring their technology to market (because of inferior technology) and want help. Mediatek is a prime example. The pro QCOM and one neutral (Interdigital) are very well written, especially Dolby's. Their arguments should resonate with free market advocates. The Koh decision needs to be overturned."

Hopefully we cross that benchmark with huge volumes again tomorrow.In the last 5 years, the high was around 82 and that time the outstanding shares were around 1.5billion.

Only then, we will be back to normal.Considering the old business is back to normal, now few new things gets added to both the top and bottom line. 5G (including mmWave), Automotive CV2X and Infotainment, RFFE, WiFi, Cloud Server, Wearables, Fingerprint, Wireless Charging, AI/VR, Audio chips. The contribution to revenue from these segments were either non-existant or non-significant in the last few years. And these are expected to grow moving forward.Future definitely looks bright.Just hope that no other country or Govt. meddles with the company's affairs again.In the immediate future, just counting that the earnings call turns positive and good guidance that is beyond expectations is suggested. That would then keep the current party alive or may be even take it up another notch."

Looks like QCOM will have a 2H launch of something. Maybe here about it during their 5G Summit event.A new report tells us that Qualcomm has secured a deal with TSMC to manufacture some parts on the latter's 5nm and 6nm process node. Whether this is for bolstering existing Snapdragon 888 capacities or for an entirely different line of products remains to be seen.
Some on here are suggesting the possibility that qcom and the FTC will settle. Is this possible? How can two parties agree on terms that don't necessarily comply with the orders of a fed judge who just issued a ruling on the trial between those same parties?

"Tendered their shares, are in bed with Hok Tan and Tim Cook. Qualcomm will eventually close this deal. The reason why this has been so difficult is that APPLE knows that once NXPI is part of Qualcomm it greatly minimizes their chance being acquired and the currenlty royalty model being eliminated. Once the NXPI deal is completed there will be an immediate pivot of Qualcomm and government staring down APPLE to pay them money owed in the billions, and complete a renogotiated % of phone cost Royalty agreement, similar to what was ratified with Samsung. At that juncture, Steve Mollekopt will continue to reduce costs within Qualcomm, own the 5 G evolution of wirless, and continue to drive new IoT NXPI techologies. Tim Cook needs to understand he will pay a % of phone Royalty for Qualcomm technology, if he doesnt negotiate in good faith and stop his planned out/ obstruction to Qualcomms business, Apple can then stop utilizing Qualcomm technology and go it alone in processor development and compete against technology developed by Qualcomm. But Mr. Cook if you dont wont to pay, you dont get to use it, and if you dont utilize Qualcomm technology, I dont think you will be selling plastic accessories for 10,000% mark up anymore."

"Sdm 870/sdm 860 released by Qcom this year were unusual, they usually just do a single flagship chip in premium tier. Sdm 888 was the premium flagship for the year.

Qcom ceo has mentioned before that chip shortage has improved for older nodes. sdm 870/860 might be to mitigate shortages on latest 5nm node. It’s pretty clever if that’s the case."
Tip of the iceberg. The eventual momentum flood of FOMO investors and those who were worried about the chip shortage should take this to 150+ in the next 2-3 days. Sticking with my 155 by Friday prediction.

However, we caution that 5G technology standards today are not yet market-ready, while previous launches of 3G and 4G smartphones in the past often arrived much later than promised. The smartphone industry is understandably very excited about 5G right now, but history suggests early 5G products may well suffer technical or financial teething problems, and the industry should be prepared for future possible delays in initial smartphone or network launches of several months, perhaps up to a year.”The full report, Global 5G Handset Shipments, Price & Revenue Forecast, is published by the Strategy Analytics Emerging Device Strategies (EDS) service, details of which can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/yd8ugncy.About Strategy Analytics:Strategy Analytics is a global, independent research and consulting firm.

Lenovo announced they will use Qualcomm chip in their game glasses
QCOM took it's company's stock from $64 to $65 in 5 years! 5 Years! Please don't give this board another 5.
obviously apple will not be buying qcom chips in the future because apple will be making its own chips..... google it
"Now on CNBC: Michael Dell (CEO of Dell) says, because of the COVID-19 pandemic 5G market penetration is accelerating!"
"$QCOM likely going to go and hold at 90-92 for a little bit, then run to 95 and hold until next earnings, then over 100"
"Looks like all the profit takers are finally out of the stock, and it can start moving up to 100"
qcom management should stop increasing dividend. instead they can do more M&A to diversify the business. who care the little increase of dividend?
Will the chip shortage hurt QCOM earnings in 1st quarter? thoughts?
"saying its a good thing apple won't have 5g because their customers hold on to older phones is like saying byclcle growth not likely to rise because big wheels last a while. how ironic that without a Qcom deal, apple might go down like nokia and BlackBerry!!!! snf snf snf"

"The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and has been through one of its boom phases. However, Susquehanna’s Christopher Rolland says the cycle is reaching a peak.“Industry lead-times and valuation multiples have expanded to levels well beyond their historical averages,” says Roland. With the segment due a pullback, Rolland thinks it’s time for a reassessment of one of the chip industry’s giants – Qualcomm (QCOM).And it’s not a positive one. Rolland downgraded QCOM’s rating from Positive (i.e. Buy) to Neutral (i.e. Hold) and slashed the price target from $175 to $155."
"Wow, great insight into where Cristiano Amon comes from in this San Diego Tribune article. I didn't realize he was instrumental in expediting 5G and taking 7 years to build the relationships in China. He is now focused on diversifying and opening up new markets and seems like exactly the right person for that job. We forget that they had $1B in one quarter in IOT... the QoQ growth of that segment is something to watch closely. Last, with regard to today's action. Just watch the volume... it tells the whole story. No volume here - so no worry. This stock has the capability to rise 10% in one day on high volume. This is nothing more than manipulation which is fine for now, but we do need QCOM to deliver the goods in the ER!https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2021-04-17/qualcomms-incoming-ceo-elect-cristiano-amon-prepares-to-take-helm"
"So they didn’t wanna wait anymore and didn’t extend the deadline for nxpi. They then immediately announced the buyback. Then they came up with a Dutch auction. Most companies out there that have been doing buybacks haven’t been doing Dutch auctions. Qcom could have just done a regular buyback like always. Putting all this together, qcom seems to me to be wanting these shares and wanting them ASAP. Maybe they are expecting major events in te very near future and wanna get as many shares as possible in advance. That’s my take at least."
we knew this was coming
"Crazy bullish IPhone 12 numbers from Morgan Stanley • Citing an internal survey of nearly 3,500 consumers, Morgan Stanley raises Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bull case price target from $171 to $191. • Analyst Katy Huberty writes that the AlphaWise survey, which included consumers in the U.S. and China, shows strong smartphone purchase intention driven by 5G. • Huberty: ""Our conviction in the AAPL bull case is rising with iPhone 12 Pro lead times at record levels, upward revisions to supply chain forecasts, and US carriers noting strong initial demand. Our AlphaWise consumer survey outlines a bull case that is much higher than we previously thought, with iPhone upgrades expected to outperform other vendors and our past surveys correlating to future growth."" • The analyst says the survey results translate to 268M bull case iPhone shipments in FY21, above the 213M consensus estimates and Morgan Stanley's prior bull case of 240M. • The iPhone ASP bull case is $842, 9% above consensus and the base case."
Market down - qcom down. Market up - qcom down. Qcom management providing consistency.

"I like 5G and I have put a little money into QCOM, but I am not sure about the time-frame for the ""uptake"" that is expected. I am down 14% since I invested into QCOM, and I am worried that it is stagnant.Any ideas as to what is the expected time-frame for the stock to start performing better?"
"Anything below 125 on this stock is a gift. I am putting every penny I got from the dividend into this stock on Monday. The possibility of this stock doubling in the next two years is almost a certain thing. The only reason it is hitting resistance in the past few weeks is that investors look at the past and not the future when it comes to this stock. Too many times in the past QCOM has disappointed, then you have the lawsuits, etc. Well, the sky has cleared and the sun is indeed very bright for the future of this company. Buy it and lock away the sell key for the next 5 years. You will be very glad you did."
4% drop going against shifting trend lines. There is no excuse: people that sold today at a loss will eventually go bankrupt in the stock market.
This is an absolutely bizarre legal ruling. This judge is telling them despite inventing and patenting technology that they aren't allowed to charge what the market will bear for it. Specifically she is claiming they need to license the rights to their IP at prices that allow competitors to use the technology to compete with them. Thats just left coast crazy talk. If competitors want their technology they have to pay whatever Qualcomm wants. If they don't agree they are free to invent their own technology. The American innovation engine is dead if this ruling stands up.
Over 5% dividend? Sold some utility sticks yielding 2 and 3% to scoop up more qcom
It should go straight back to the 150s.
Bought at 138.60
It is puzzling to me that in light of the semi shortage that QCOM would trade in such a lackadaisical manner.I look forward to some excitement to lift the stock.
NVIDIA's sales increased by 57% driven by its compute and networking segment. Is that a good signal for QCOM? Not sure how relevant NVIDIA is to QCOM tho
"CEO on CNBC expects deal to go through. 90 day deadline still intact or buyback goes into play. Says progress in China is being made. Regarding AAPL, decision made via settlement or court by EOY. Thinks settlement is more likely."
There's an article on Entrepreneur (.com) about how undervaluation of Qualcomm .
Sell offs seem to be getting milder and milder.
The judge disallowed Apple's financial model testimony last Friday. I think that QCOM is buying shares again. Volume is low but it is going up a little at a time. I increased my position by 25% yesterday to lower my average cost.
"its all politics, sit tight. you can make a lot of money playing the puts & calls. if you r long term justyawn as usual. if you r new to qcom relax. it never goes too high or too low. it is however, very frustrating to watch this soap opera as it plays out. my prediction is apple gets a slap on wrist, is content on scrappy iphone and goes for developing g their own chips. in time after China looks in the mirror and realizes that they really do have a small one and slightly gives in. the US also gives in and takes less than deserved. hey, I'm all for pressuring China to respect tech patent laws, Any ans ALL laws for that matter. just wait and watch hiw this plays out. everybody loves money and there's too much on the table to lose, for everybody....."
This has been the most fun 2 weeks of being long on QCOM. Cheers to all the longs

"Qualcomm May-14 and May-21 equity options are very heavily weighted on the put side, so downside risk in the stock now greatly reduced. The May-21 are about 10:1 Put:call. This means two things, 1.) Retail now bearish, 2.) The decline recently was in part due to the new heavy put positions (the market maker shorts the puts, in order to make a market. Then the stock is shorted to hedge that option position)"
Why Qcom moons when its earning tanks? It moons from $137 to $145 now... Weird
"oh thank God, up 3%"
I couldn't help but buy more
Great buying Point. Remember there is no substitute to QCOM. Mark my words
I'll pretend to cry since 1/2 my position is from $AMC profits.
So what is company's strategy since Koh announced that disastrous ruling? Just stay put? meanwhile stock just drifts with market after 25% haircut in short order.

And qcoms snapdragon is the best.2. Apple lawsuit, as they lost in china and germany and in the USA, Apple will loose everywhere. They signed a contract, thats it! Nobody put a gun on their head. Without qcoms chips, iphone is just an Ipod. Qcom spent a lot of money in R&D and to hire very expensive employes.Its like saying pfizer or abbv must give for free the formula for there drugs! It makes no sense. Qcom could buy nokia for exemple and put their chips only on their phone and have a monopoly. Nobody forces coca cola to give their formula to pepsi!?!?Maybe they could say qcom can only keep their “pattents” for only 30 years, but that it.3. Even if they loose, one judge doesnt matter, they will appeal. 4. Huawei the biggest witness!?! Arent their CFO in jail? Arent their products banned in the USA?5. For me the biggest proof qcoms contracts are fair is that apple when wanted switched to intel. Why didnt they started out with intel!? Nobody forced them to go with qcom. They chose qcom because it was the best, and much of the market share apple has today is due to qcom. Lenovo huawey also have their own chips."

"Qualcomm Is Poised to Rise Higher Aggressive traders could go long QCOM at current levels as after consolidation the tech company should move up.By BRUCE KAMICH Jun 29, 2020 | 02:45 PM EDTStocks quotes in this article: QCOMQualcomm Inc. (QCOM) looks ready to resume its rally. Let's check out the charts of this company that makes semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology."
"I may be wrong, but a few days ago I said I am sticking with 5G, 5G is going to change everything in digital communication and to get 5G one has to go through QCOM. One way or another this company is going to triple, i.e., buyout or straight up!"
"Because of the current ominous pandemic that spreads in multiple the world on the other side will have to move much faster to make up for all the loss of time. There will be massive pent up demand for 5G for growth in all aspects of business, which means whatever growth was in stored for QCOM before the pandemic may have just increased several folds in order for the growth that will be needed to stabilize all the globes economy. In my view the pullback on QCOM now leads me to view it trading at a massive discount price. QCOM may well be worth $300+ buy 2021, on the event we have to flatten the curve and the world gets back in motion. In a more distant environment with a major shift to outright delivery, there will be an immediate requirement for speed and new forms of communication in IoT."
"Boot Steve and Paul out to the curb, terminate NXP transaction and announce a major partnership with them instead. Declare a monstrous cash dividend and bring that $40 billion back to the shareholders."
"Fund companies holding QCOM shares have the final say on Broadcom's offer, not retail investors or management,Qcom investors have missed out on the biggest bull run in the last year by a Qcom's management team too consumedwith litigation."
"Trying to digest the 9th circuit's stay document a bit more : Important excepts to anticipate how 9th circuit will rule in their final appeals ruling, we can already see how the 9th is relying heavily on DOJ/DOE's positions as well as dissenting FTC commissioners. The wording used in the stay is very indicative : 1) We are satisfied that Qualcomm has shown, at minimum, the presence of serious questions on the merits of the district court’s determination that Qualcomm has an antitrust duty to license its SEPs to rival chip suppliers.2) Qualcomm likewise has made the requisite showing that its practice of charging OEMs royalties for its patents on a per handset basis does not violate the antitrust laws.3) The fundamental business changes that the injunction imposes cannot be easily undone should Qualcomm prevail on appeal. 4) Indeed, the Department of Defense and Department of Energy aver that the injunction threatens national security, and the DOJ posits that the injunction has the effect of harming rather than benefiting consumers. https://essentialpatentblog.lexblogplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2019/08/2019.08.23-074-Order-Granting-Stay-of-Injunction.pdf"
Absolutely no reason for this drop of the gates with Nas being up 80 points. I am starting to believe the MMs are really trying everything to keep the price in check so the hedge funds can load up because those earnings and good news probably caught them out
"I'm voting blue and as Cramer said on CNBC this morning : we do not know how large institutions are going to vote . We may assume that AVGO contacted them and have them on their side.

Isn't Samsung making the 888 and the new modems. Does anyone know for sure because that is what I read. Also Qualcomm guided after knowing what April looked like so why would thy fall on TSM april news?
NXPI shareholders don't think the QCOM buyout will happen. NXPI price $120 and change / share.

I don’t get it. Who holds QCOM until after the amazing earnings and guidance and then decides to sell their shares for $140??? This stock should have a 40PE ratio.
"Let me canoodle on this a bit.1) Judge Koh ruled that QCOM must license Standard Essential Patents to Intel, since modems cannot be built to the Standards without this patented technology.2) Intel is selling modems that meet the Standards to Apple.3) Did Judge Koh just rule that Intel is using QCOM's patents without a license?4) And if so, where did they get this technology. Apple, do you happen to have any clue? Isn't QCOM suing you for umpty-ump dollars, allegedly for this behavior?Did the FTC just blow-up Apple's defense in the other court case?"
"Samsung S21 is launched today. By many indications customers are unhappy with Samsung's use of own Exynos which is considered inferior and would much prefer Snapdragon. As Samsung is locked in competition with Chinese in India and elsewhere, they may rethink Exynos if continue to lose market share. This is not a given by any means, but recent moves Qualcomm made with Nuvia show they are competing head on with Apple for the processor crown and not just in smartphones. The big loser may be Intel and perhaps AMD which is way overpriced."
Apple a customer once again. Much better result to the litigation then expected. This is going to $80 by end of year.
This could be a huge win for Qualcomm. Infringement of their patent could cost Apple billions of dollars.

"Great buying opportunity created by news article concerning hack. Article indicate that issue was resolved but may still have holes... same thing happened to intel/amd chips few years back. They both came back strong. Here are some of the reasons why this is buying opportunity. 1) this is more likely android issue since this doesn’t happen in Apple phones. 2) they will always come up with new ways to hack, as a consumers only way to be safe is to update software and only download from reputable source as mentioned in same article. 3) are there as other rival chip out there? Intel is no longer making modem chips, and your not not going to buy from Chinese chip companies due to more security issues 4) if you don’t jail break your phone like most people, this should be non issue. Like I said buying opportunity... QCOM is in early stage of 5G revolution and growth. Good luck to all Kong’s."

"Concerns reg. Q and National Security are undoubtedly serious. One could ask, why FTC brought forward this case. Looking to the parties who are supporting the FTC case (Apple, Intel, Huawei, Samsung) the answer seems to be easy: get rid of a competitor as Q is a very important player in the ANDROID world and keeps competition moving. That’s the bitter irony: FTC, who should protect consumers by strengthening competition, is doing the opposite now, trying to support the ongoing accumulation of profits towards Apple, Intel, Samsung and Huawei. Next victim could be Intel. Brave new world, where innovation is depending on a few companies. Hopefully the Judge ( who has to follow the law, which does not directly refer to aspects of national security and Short Term Profitability) will look at the mission of FTC in general: ensure competition."
AAPL infringed on QCOM's patent for battery saving technology. Buyers of an iPhone now will not know if they have a 'snapdragon QCOM modem phone' or a lemon (Intel modem).
"QCOM put out the theater of appearing to negotiate and the stock started moving up. Now that we see that it was all subterfuge and not a real offer, the stock is moving back down. You can see the movement even more in the pricing and volume of the options. It is still more likely than not that AVGO gets the six seats on the board, but the odds of a negotiated deal prior to the vote seem to be diminishing."

"I need someone to explain somethings to me. Honest question. No pumping. No trashing. I am not familiar with all the small details of Qualcomm's business. What I do know is that they make chips for all kinds of devices and they have a ton of patents on all kinds of chip technology. I also know that they are very big. Really big leading company. And, of course, I know that they have conflicts with other companies, like Apple and a few others who think they can do without Qualcomm's products.One thing I understand pretty well is fundamentals, and, oh boy, Qualcomm's fundamentals look pretty spectacular.Now, speaking of chip shortage. That's where I am getting a little bit lost. People are talking about shortages being a big problem. I can't see why it's a problem for Qualcomm. For others? Yes. But doesn't it mean that Qualcomm sells everything they have in their inventory? Granted, they can't ramp up production very easily, but just the fact that prices of everything they manufacture keep climbing up I can't see how their earnings could not improve. And we all know that an improved bottom line always leads to better stock prices.So, can someone tell me why the chip shortage is a negative thing for Qualcomm?"
Brutal. Why didn’t I sell after earnings?!!!

"Assuming AAPL win its fight on licencing fee, QCOM can pull the plug on the software. AAPL can't make a phone on their own without QCOM software support. They can buy chip from INTC, but INTC can't make chip that outperform QCOM. Bottom line, AAPL will have to come back begging QCOM for 5G chip and software if they ever dream to have chance in the 5G. CDMA is now obsolete. btw, I don't like QCOM (they treat their worker as slaves). But I own their stock because they are far ahead on the 5G."
"In a worst case scenario where China increases tariffs on US-based QCOM chips that makes QCOM chips too expensive to be use in phones manufactured in China (but not too expensive to use Samsung and Huawei chips), how badly would QCOM’s stock suffer?

"I'm no lawyer and not even a techie. But I have been around the block and have served in executive capacities. In reading the cnet article and previous commentary on the trial, it seems Apple's defense was basically an eye roll. The comment that Qcomm ""dusted off some patents and saw what would stick"". I mean, huh? As if new patents have better value than older or old patents aren't worthy of IP protection. It sounds like something a non-legal person would say, not the lead defense lawyer of a trillion dollar company. Also, the idea that the patent wasn't rightfully Qcom's. Isn't that something for another trial? It's like saying the US Patent and Trademark office was wrong in their decision to award the patent, and so therefore, this case is wrong. What?!?!? Would love to hear others' views."
Qualcomm does not need this deal. There are so many other companies they can acquire now.
So apparently $Qcom did well so how will Gsat be affected tomorrow or this week? New Investor here..

"Coronovirus is no longer an epidemic it is now really a pandemic as it has spread to 28 countries on different continents. Also the incubation period in at least one case was reported as long as 38 days. The death rate is not 2% but more like 11% when you measure the ratio of deaths vs survivors after the having had the disease. The seriousness is being played down by all governments as there currently no vaccine even though a US company by the name of Inovio says they have one in animal testing. Be cautious most companies will be adversely affected by this pandemic,probably among the most vulnerable are technology companies that rely on suppliers and/or assemblers in heavily affected areas. This condition won’t last forever and it offers opportunities to increase positions in companies you like and have done you due diligence."

"Food for thought!! Why do you think Apple had to ""Blink"" and settle with QCOM??

Just saying i don't buy the ""oversold"" theory. Kinda meaningless here. You wanna point to a moving avg or something, ok. I sense today's move is more news or rumor driven."
I’m not really following this trial as close as I’m sure some here are. But it seems to me that one company isn’t pleased with intel’s components but had to settle for them. This could be why Apple is going hard at qcom and shooting down any idea of settlement.

Broadcom ignored this express warning from CFIUS and appeared in court the following day.

Qualcomm anticipates that it will get 50% more revenue from 5G phones than from 4G phones. The analyst expects the company’s quarterly sales to grow to $7.4 billion in the September 2021 quarter, from $4.8 billion two years earlier, driven by increased Apple iPhone modem sales, greater dollar content with 5G, and market-share gains. Longer term, he sees growth opportunities for Qualcomm in the Internet of Things and automotive markets.5G is happening no matter what the Beer Virus does!!

"Here is the reason why I thing QCOM will eventually win the court battle over Apple. QCOM won the same argument in courts in Europe a few years back against Nokia and will win it again this time because once the issue is dissected Apple has no case: Without QCOM essential patents there would not be a wireless internet access (at a meaningful speed) that would thrive the smart phone business. In other words all the smart phone manufacturers will not be where they are today (specially Apple) if it wasn't because of QCOM's breakthrough inventions in 3G and 4G. So the court judge will ask this question from a potential apple customer to determine who should win the court case. The question is:How much would you pay for an iPhone if it didn't have any wireless capability except through WiFi? Meaning you could only access the internet at home. If the answer is people still would pay the full price, then judge will vote in favor of Apple. But if they say they wouldn't pay anything, then judge will vote in favor of Qualcomm and grant permission for QCOM to continue with the existing model. In my opinion no one would buy an iPhone without a 3G/4G capability. And it is only fair for QCOM to be rewarded for their inventions in 3G/4G so they can continue funding the 5G and future technologies.Notice that this model was not invented by QCOM. It is also used by Nokia and Erickson and was blessed by the communication industry to increase the competition and keep the price of the chips low. That is why you pay only $40 for a QCOM snapdragon but you pay $300 for an intel chip. That is the proof that the system worked. Apple probably pays more for the plastic material it uses in iPhone than the money it pays Qcom for their breakthrough inventions in 3G/4G and the modem chips they use."

QCOM around $145 is our NEXT huge opportunity. Wait a month or two for sentiment to change and PE to expand. This will be over $200 soon and heading to $300. Analysts will revise their targets.

"Qualcomm - Arm Announces ArmV9 Architecture: SVE2, Security, and the next Decade""It’s been nearly 10 years since Arm had first announced the Armv8 architecture in October 2011, and it’s been a quite eventful decade of computing as the instruction set architecture saw increased adoption through the mobile space to the server space, and now starting to become common in the consumer devices market such as laptops and upcoming desktop machines. Throughout the years, Arm has evolved the ISA with various updates and extensions to the architecture, some important, some maybe glanced over easily.""""Today, as part of Arm’s Vision Day event, the company is announcing the first details of the company’s new Armv9 architecture, setting the foundation for what Arm hopes to be the computing platform for the next 300 billion chips in the next decade."""

Anemic volume. Friday is monthly option expiration with 200k OI with Max pain at 135. I expect next week ER date will be announced and we see some buying. Unlikely to happen this week. I sure hope Amon did what he needed to do for the ER! Increasing guidance for second half would be a welcome event - and maybe even providing some color for FY22.
"They must have known I bought June 4th calls $138 strike today because the minute I did, it cratered $1.25 in less then 10 minutes. Looks like more losses coming for me. Should have stuck with Viacom as I sold too early today in those calls and gave all the gains back due to Qual "

"With huawei being banned from 5G Qcom will dominate the western market!!! This will sky rocket!! Just have some patience through the trial... but QCom can only win in the end.. even if ftc wins this trial, there will be appeals...Apples trials around the world has nothing to do with this... it has to do with broken pattents and the money they own qcom will not seize to exist..Worse case scenerio is Qcom looses ftc and goes to appeal, no impact in revenue... makes a deal with apple doenst receive all the money, but for sure some money which is better than nothing... And will dominate de 5g world for the next decade increasing profits extremely!! Even if cell phones sales decline, 5g will be used in cars, military, smart homes and businesses..There are no downsides, specially with such a high dividend for tour patience!!Plus the company has done and still doing a huge buyback... 30% of the float!!! Which means that when the stock does go up a major ahort squeeze will happen since there will be less shares available for the shorts to repurchase..."
QCOM is the next NVDA.5G leader in USA.Should be around $200 by year end.
I'm losing patience with this. It better not go back down to pre-earnings price.
The headline should read ''ITC rules Apple is INFRINGING on Qualcomm patent'' but allows sales to continue because the judge could never face the public if he banned sales on the iphone..
"beleive me, street will like young and dynamic new CEO. 400$ by 2021 for sure."
best thing was that I sold at 67 because of all the hype that the deal will happen... lol thanks oktalose for the nice cash .. buying again tomorrow at this low price

I remember the last earnings report. This thing tanked and people said it’s a buying opportunity. Hasn’t gone anywhere since. Hate Wall Street.
It’s about time to party like it’s 1999.
"Today's move was right in line w/ the SOX and SMH and far less than MU, which gotten taken out to the woodshed. So one would have to think that investors were not moved by the FTC or LG. Will be interesting to see how much it moves if Koh denies the stay. I would guess 2-3 bucks and maybe then I'd buy some calls. Hopefully that's moot because she orders a stay."

I said it before I said again Qcom is King of all chips..
"Again, I have to reference activist investors... If one has the time, money, and experience, accumulating this morning could lead to an easy 30% gain within one year for an activist investor. AVGO even offered a fee back to QCOM if it doesn't pass regulatory approval; and a fee if the deal takes longer than expected.

"Concessions from Qcom to end legal disputes. It is a start and Qcom is at least showing in good faith to settle disputes. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) announces three concessions it hopes will resolve its legal battle with Apple.Qualcomm will offer a lower-cost license that charges 3.25% the cost of the device for “standard essential patents” instead of the full suite for a 5% fee. The company will include use of its 5G patents at no additional cost. And, as previously announced, Qualcomm will assess patent fees against only the first $400 of a phone’s selling price instead of the prior $500 cap. The discount benefits makers of premium-priced smartphones like Apple’s iPhone X."
"Agreed. Almost 5% while you wait for them to work through one of biggest extortion attempts in the history of technology. This management has fought through the organized attempt by Apple and Broadcom to weaken and overtake this company. They failed. Half of the international antitrust uproar is fuel by the Apple machine. Apple has to find ways to keep growing. They are masters at pinching all of their suppliers. The supplier they cannot pinch is the one that owns all the core technology that allows their devices to have so much utility and value. Ultimately Apple wants to change the rules. Qualcomm is powerful enough to object. Apple doesnt like that, so they go about conspiring with the rest of the world to contend that what Qualcomm charges is unfair. Here is how this goes from here.... 1) NXPI deal is approved by China as part of a ZTE slap on the wrist workout 2) free Cash flow following that deal will be around 10 Billion a year. Now the street can ignore that fact, and that is ok, for Steve Mollenkopt will proceed to buy back every share he possibly can at these levels. 2) Dividend. Stable. Covered. Potential to increase. 3) Apple winfall payment. Even if Qualcomm makes concessions int Royaly rate, a royalty is still going to exist for the use of their technology. Once the Apple lawsuiys are settled, Apple will be forced to pay a negotiated royalty, as part of that royalty settlement, back payment in the billons will need to be settled to Qualcomm from Apple. Royalty Model stays in place, Billions in Cash settled to Qualcomm, NXPI deal approved increasing free cashflow to over 10 Billion Annually, 1 Billion in expense reduction, leaner, Meaner Qualcomm. (Understand Apples game. Will watch them much more closely as they do business with Tim Cook in the future). BUY BUY BUY"
"If the market starts to correct this time, don't blame Jay Powell. Trump is the only one who you have to blame. Trump keeps saying China pays tariffs, misleading us, even though every body knows that the consumers pay for every dollar. I will tell you that the cost of livings will go higher, every thing that imports from China will be priced higher, up to one point, the household will start to cut the expense. business will slow down. Trump will push Jay to cut the interest rate in order to stimulate the business, but will not work this time, because every thing already gets higher, to force down will be hard to do. Minimum wage goes up, rent going up, cost of livings going up. Recession will come by, and Trump will blame Democrats, LOL"

"Said it before and I'll say it again....it's high time qcom takes some sort of decisive action to preclude further suits. Perhaps that's splitting the company, perhaps another alternative. But you can't tell me that shareholder value is being maximized, nor can you tell me the company's abilities are being maximized with this CONSTANT legal overhang. Is there another company out there comparable??? It's almost become part of the culture of the co."
Time to buy this stock ?? in at $75 today.. hope she soars..
The argument is simple: Many want to get paid now and some want to get paid a bit more a longer time later. I wanna get paid now and move my cash to the next investment.

"the company that is feared the most is always attacked the most. Why is qcom feared o uch? Because they own 5G. qcom will dominate 5G is mobile devices, mobile infrastructure, self driving and assisted driving vehicles, edge computing and AI. The fear mongers will change their tune in late april and early may."

"WSJ. ""Qualcom to receive European approval for NXP bid as early as next week""!!!!!"
"We all know QCOM positioning into 5G is among the top of the top and we will UNDOUBTEDLY succeed and do very well over the next 5-10 years. QCOM is ready to break to new highs, imo. 2021 target of $250+. FEDS won't let the crash happen until Covid is gone, as these BIG BUSINESS companies need to position themselves well for The Great Reset - Sustainability, renewable energy, green and technology push into the 4th Industrial Revolution, and we are living through it! Stay invested because IMHO, FED will not let the markets crash at a time like this when all BIG BUSINESS is positioning themselves for this push. Market crash comes very shortly AFTER Covid is taken care of and they loosen QE efforts. MP"
"I was bound to happen to the tech stocks. However, this company should not sell-off like this. If you have spare cash jump in. QCOM is just starting to get the valuation it deserves. With 5G, litigation risk in the rearview mirror, and every Tom, #$%$ and Harry that want to play in 5G begging them to use their technology, this is a sure bet to be over 200 by 2023, and that is being conservative."

"the dramatic movement in stocks recently is ALL based on bond yields going up and worries of inflation. the 10 year treasury has been moving sometimes 20 bips at a time up OR down. Remember the 10 treasury bond was around .60 at it's lowest. It's now at this moment 1.59. Watch the 10 year to know which way the market is going. Also, it's also because it's going up, but because of speed. the market will digest this eventually and settle down. Good trading to all."

By then it will be bought out for $40/share, half of Hock's offer."
where is the apple/qcom suite going. when could we expect it to be over???
"At least I read why the ITC disregarded the San Diego order: the jury in San Diego did not determine if the patents are invalid. I’m asking myself, if it is possible that a patent is invalid but being infringed. Common sense would tell me, that once an infringement is ordered, validity is ordered as well....quite sure Q will appeal."
Without Apple FTC most important witness wouldve been Huawei hahahahah $100 on earnings $154 in 12 months
"I personally think that in 15 years time. The Market cap of Qualcomm will exceed that of Any other company on the globe. It probably should already if not for government/political interference and unethical corporate law,"
I think there’s going to be big money moving more into the 5G stocks in the new year so QCOM should easily be north of $100 soon. Jmo but this is a gift here

"After week 1 of the San Diego Court Case, Q experts want 1.40 USD as compensation for the infringed 3 patents. The amount is about 50 % of the added value, that these patents create ( longer battery life, one flash memory less). So the stated amount of 1.40 USD represents the sales, that Q would have realized, if patents would have been paid for. It’s worth o mention, that the 3 patents are non standard essential patents and have nothing to do with modem. Again, many press articles translate the 1.40 USD, multiplied with the number of devices, to an amount of 31 m USD and consider this as a lousy amount (which is true). Big picture, I believe it’s a cornerstone for Q, because the value of Q’s patents are described. So when 3 patents are worth 1,40 USD, what’s the value of Q’s total patent portfolio of more than 100.000 patents. Is Apple having a point, when they want to pay 1.50 USD for all Q’s patents ? The following article describes the stand points of Q and Apple, the article itself uses also an interesting link....https://www.cnet.com/news/qualcomm-wants-31-million-in-damages-in-apple-patent-case/"

"According to trending on yahoo yesterday, the United States government is facing a severe shortage of chips also. It was also recently announced in a Chinese daily that there is a world wide “severe shortage “ of chips! What is that telling you?

These limitations will also free up capacity at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Amon said in a webcast with Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall."
"Shannon CrossGreat. Thank you. And then, I'm sure you're probably expecting a question on Qualcomm settlement. So what would you like to say on this settlement? How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? And how should we think about this with regard to -- I don't know your development plans in the future? Because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G, but clearly it helps that path. Thank you.Tim CookYeah. Thank you, Shannon. We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world has been dismissed and settled. We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement. And we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.Wamsi MohanThanks for the color Tim. And as my follow-up Luca can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near-term? And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? Thank you.Luca MaestriAs Tim has explained we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter we guided 37% to 38% fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm."

apple and qualcomm... are on sale!!!!
"HERE'S A REALITY CHECK...

"Spectacular plummet here in last five mins, waterfall in effect"
"And finally, if Qualcomm would have seen any threat from Intel’s IP portfolio, they would be the first in line to buy it for any cost"
So Qcom is pulling out its application to mofcom and to refile
"problem with QCOM, for the past (from the beginning) , 5-10 years of hibernation after each peak of 'good' news, $165 recent peak? until 2030? - end of apple and 5G, the next 10 years will be down and boring, again..?"
So I Purchased 35 shares at 146$ and also bought 3 contracts for march 5. 146$ calls. I’m hoping this bad boy can start to recover and trend back towards the 160 levels within the next two weeks!
"Its amazing the analyst questions are centered around hand sets... QCOM saying ...hello, we are growing IOT from 1.1B to 1.3B in Q3. Sure you guys don't want to ask a few questions about that RAPID growth in diversified revenue? What a joke...these analysts guys know nothing but hand sets and are missing the elephant in the room."
ASML was down since early Feb along with QCOM - reported an earnings beat and now past their Feb highs.
That large sell order before close must be crying now.
"QCOM royalties sales should experience exponential growth once Apple starts shipping 5G iPhone. There is a lot of pent up demand including replacement cycle. Plus network effect of expanding 5G Networks. QCOM is the 5G Gorilla with key enabling proprietary tech, open architecture and value chain like OEMs. Usually the market underestimates revenue and profits. Especially in the Tornado Phase. These will be real profits, real cash flow, dividends. On current share price. Assuming the FTC case does not have a bad outcome."
"FYI for those that haven't caught this news, QCOM developed this miniature helicopter to be the first flight on Mars, the flight is supposed to take place this Sunday. so although it may not bring in the bacon, the prestige and press coverage to QCOM is priceless if the flight goes off as planned.

"After watching the first hour of QCOM's event day presentation, I'm blown away by the picture of the 5G future they are outlining, almost every device we use in our everyday lives will be connected to 5G...QCOM is the KEY to 5G and the future device connections potential is HUGE!!! By the standards the are forecasting, I believe that this train hasn't even left the station yet.GLTA"
"CNBC Live: Dan Niles owns Qualcomm, bullish on 5G!"
"For those thinking of buying QCOM at $50 and believe is a good deal, remember this:QCOM will trade in the macro-economic weather that is not supportive of further stock price growth:(1) Fed will raise rate 2X more this year, 3X next year.(2) Fed will pursue QT. There's strong correlation with Fed's balance sheet and S&P500.QCOM is basically now trading a pre-AVGO event, but back then AAPL lawsuit & trade-war issues weren't as pronounced. Dow has advanced further and like this bull market is ending or will be trading side-ways like during the period of 2015\2016.Why would I buy QCOM when NASDAQ is at record territory? There's a saying ""tide lifts all boats"", well yes, the opposite is true too. If you anticipate a 10% correction or more in the broad market, QCOM will sink even more.I see low $40's or even low $30's by year end."
"One step forward 3 steps backward, that is Qualcomdey."
This is about 5G! Infrastructure will take place. Why is the stock again tanking??? It is difficult to digest again!!!!!!!
"What happens if all AVGO's board recommendations are accepted by QCOM shareholders but Hock and team decide that now with the 127.50 for nxpi, the deal is too pricey? Do they just resign? Seems the timing here was awkward to say the least. Proxies went out before the nxpi offer increased."
"QCOM, Should B a 100$$ Stock. EZ"
Even if Broadcom doesn't buy QCOM we need major changes in management. This group has shown they can do nothing to enrich the shareholders who have trusted them.

How do you think the earnings report on May 1st will affect this surge?
"QCOM is not going to pay $135 for NXPI, as Elliot wants. QCOM will walk away from this deal and accept $80 a share from AVGO. Really poor management from QCOM and the way this was handled."
"OK, so it's my understanding that the disputed funds withheld by Apple and Apple's vendors are in escrow. I have wondered just how much is in that kitty, since it's important as bargaining takes place (I am presuming bargaining does take place).My admittedly uneducated guess is $6B, mainly eyeballed by revenue changes over the last couple years. I will not fight and die on that $6B figure, other estimates may well be better than mine.I bring this subject up as I have further thoughts, but this is enough for this post."
"My understanding is, the reason that they did not mention the newer iphones because the newer iphones did not exist when the lawsuit filed last year. It could very well included this decision?"
Babu says QCOM to Mars but first it will have a pit stop on the dark side of the moon..
"Interesting that QCOM just recently indicated to Broadcom that there were no longer and regulatory issues to be concerned about and the only thing in the way of an agreement was a better offer price. I still think this will occur once Broadcom replaces the BoD, becomes a U S company in May and makes a better offer to share holders."
Dragged by the bearish market
QCOM is so cheap. It looks oil stock. It seems street hates this company. Hopefully it is changed soon.
"Folks when you analysis the details of Apple buy the Intel modem patents and IP the only sane conclusion is it is a mistake. After all Intel busted it’s butt trying to make a better 5G modem chip then QCOM’s and could not do it. And after years of research and hard work, basically Intel wasted so much time that it put Apple in a pinch, without a top rated Modem chip for a high end phone maker like Apple they would have ended up with a third ranked phone, they need the best for their phones.So, Apple was between a rock and a hard place and was forced to settle with QCOM so they could use “Snapdragon” in their phones. To now go back and spend money on this old Intel modem research seems really dumb. Or maybe as some folks are saying that they did give Intel a bunch of QCOM’s secrets and now they have to buy it back to hind the proof that they did an illegal act!! And even with QCOM’s secrets they could not make a better chip, ummm!The “Analysis of the facts” show’s us all that selling on this news is a huge mistake!! Hold your share or add to them."
Anyone thinks QCOM will be $82 p/s sometime soon?

QCOM will snap back to $170 very quickly guys!
I added 50% of my stake from avg 68 to now 75. I’m happy with it because I think funds are just picking up sellers that doesn’t have a long window. The 5G bull is real
The US gov will not allow AVGO to buy QCOM. It's over. Ready to add to my position in the mid 50s
Qualcom stock is trading around 55 Dollars which is very cheap. AVGO wanted to buy Qualcom at 80 Dollars just last year and the old CEO wanted to take private at 80 dollars. They see value in Qualcom stock
There is now an 11 percent swing between NXPI going up and QCOM going down. We got no bump from AVGO bid of $82
I sold last Friday. The Apple deal was not going to affect Q1 earnings so I did not see it going up. Q2 earnings will get a bump from the one time settlement
"Don’t listen to CITI. He is a shill for hedge funds.

"QCOM on the docket, Judge Koh weighing in any day now."
"Thinking of making a substantial investment for me in QCOM. $40,000.00 Any thoughts or opinions would be much appreciated. Should I dollar cost average or should I invest it all at once.

"It is typically not good for a CFO to leave but here are my thoughts on this. INTC is a much bigger company and perhaps INTC CEO sees potential, even being instrumental in valuing QCOM since he knows a lot about it and helping INTC make a bid for QCOM. My opinion is someone big will bid for QCOM again. Thoughts?"
"Among rumors that Apple is facing back orders due to high demand, the premium phone wars are about to heat up even more so, because Samsung’s is launching it's Galaxy S21 early it is going to arrive surprisingly soon and not only has Samsung now confirmed the new models, we now also know they will have stunning new designs."
"Hock Tan has to keep buying companies, or his house of cards collapses in on itself ,,,,"
"Some reports give the impression, that the court case is also due to personal issues between the CEOs, escalating in the last two years. True or untrue, Apple wrote already a letter to ETSI in 2011 ( S Jobs died sadly one month before the letter was send...still think that the whole problem started then). So in 2011 Apple was voting for a percentage of selling price of a basic communication device (which is a modem chip for 30 $). ETSI, as the main standardization body, has never replied to this letter openly; think ETSIs reaction or better non-reaction speaks for itself. Look to the link, in the letter look at ,Common Royalty Base‘. https://appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/07/apple_asks_etsi_standards_body_to_set_rules_for_standards_essential_patents. So it’s not a conflict since 2017, ETSI by showing no reaction shows, what they think about it."

Cramer said shorts are driving QCOM up. That is impossible because volume is so high. QCOM going higher because it is a value buy!

"As an EE, I am familiar with both of these companies: BRCM/AVGO & QCOM. I can tell you that based on past dealings, the real gem wrt BRCM is their AVGO acquisition. BRCM acquiring QCOM will not be positive for QCOM long term. If BRCM had not acquired AVGO, I don't think they could have remained viable. QCOM doesn't need BRCM/AVGO to thrive."
Good time to buy?

"consider: QCOM has been belly good to me... up almost 125% in the 3 years since first bought. But lordy, it's way above it's historical FV. The 5 yr. blended P/E (three trailing yr. average and 2 year projected) is 17.73. Even with great E. increase est. for FY21 of $6.40, at QCOM's own historical avg. that would be ~$114. Using it's 10 yr. blended P/E of 15.5, which averages in several years of undervaluation, would be $99 by EO FY21, $116 for FY22. If the FY21 estimates of 50% E increase come about, yeah price could keep rising..but still would be well above hist.P/E avg. I've put a down sell limit of $125..I could always buy back, probably lower. What do you think?..no ra-ra fanboys or perma-shorts... just LT shareholder thoughts.."

"I have been following FTC vs QCOM trial through twitter for few days now here is my understanding. Please correct me if i am wrong since i am not a lawyer and I am trying to understand.First, According to many articles and interviews QCOM’s view was NO license, NO chip. One has to sign license agreement and agree to the price if you want the chip. Apple didn’t want to pay $7.50 but wanted to pay only $1.50 so qcom didn’t sell the chip to them ... how is this unfair? I don’t think $1.50 would have covered cost of research and development and qcom would be going out of business.Apple operating chief Jeff williams say something like he felt there was gun to his head... I guess Apple shouldn’t have tried to steal from qcom. Second, Shapiro idea of fair is in-fact unfair. Technology leader is leader through technological innovation and good engineering. He mentioned something like Qualcomm should be commended for its technological achievements but companies who aren't quite as good or who don't have the scale are not impeded from trying to catch and threaten and challenge the leader. Who aren’t quite good? Should be allowed to catch up? As long as leadership is maintained through innovation and through technological advancement its fair game.So far this trial didn’t prove anything indicating qcom did anything wrong. It only proved that qcom was saying from beginning. No license agreement, No chip.Apple stopped paying why should qcom continue to provide chip?"

"Huawei wants > 1 bn $ patent Fee from Verizon. It’s clear what happens now: Verizon will go to Chinese FTC. Argument: too expensive. Chinese FTC will announce court case. Due to negative press around it, Huawei will dismiss hundreds of engineers, will say : future development unclear as R&D will not be recovered. During trial, all arguments from Huawei will be ignored. Huawei will worldwide be forced by Chinese Court to lower patent fees and license on component level especially to Nokia, as Nokia can’t afford R&D due to their wrong execution of the past. Everything is now FRAND (Free and non discriminatory). Huawei will stop R&D. Nokia, not being supported by others, also stops operation after 2 years, as other companies have their own ecosystems only.Bizarre, isn’t it ? Who would think, such things could happen in other countries ?"

"Barnett: I agree that economists are vital to sound antitrust analysis and adjudication. But I don’t feel that the court in this case gave due consideration to the economic analysis on either side, which does not give a great deal of confidence in the substantive outcome. It’s surprising that the court did not assess the strength of the government’s key expert witness and, in a single sentence I believe, essentially dismissed the testimony of the defendant’s key expert witness. Yet the opinion has no trouble relying on and describes at length the obviously conflicted testimony of producer/licensees, such as Samsung, Huawei and others, who unsurprisingly allege that Qualcomm’s royalties are “too high.” The district court’s failure to engage with the economic testimony in this case compares unfavorably with the district court’s thorough examination of the economic testimony in US v. ATT et al (Time Warner merger), independent of whether or not the substantive outcome in that case was correct.From https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2019/06/10/no-license-no-chips-no-dice-dissecting-judge-kohs-opinion-in-ftc-v-qualcomm/ One of the strongest arguments that there is no economic proof reg. the courts decision that prices are too high from Q.

"An open apology to Steve Mollenkopf: Dear Steve, I'm sorry I had such little faith that you were truly doing what you felt was right for the Company versus acting in your best interests. In the AVGO deal, I suspected you and your mgmnt team wanted only to hang on to your role and all that comes with it. I didn't believe for once that you really felt qcom was worth north of $82, especially at that time. But in reading all the news stories over the last week and through to today, it seems to me that you did indeed believe you were doing what was right for qcom. So.....my apologies."
I think the only benefit of Apple buying the Intel Tech is to keep Qualcomm from buying it. Reality is Intel's Tech was inferior to qualcomm's forcing Apple to make the original change back to Qualcomm this is a whole bunch of nothing to worry about if your Qualcomm shareholder a lot of smoke
Qualcomm says 'all' top-tier OEMs will launch 5G phones next year
"Once and for all will qcom spin out the license business, reap the benefits of offering such a huge cash-flow generator and focus on their chips. I don't see that synergy is gained from the license business and newco would have a large contingent of legal staff to fight this thing as part of their normal, ongoing business.......rather than qcom maintaining such a huge legal team and wasting time and creating the opposite of synergy - inefficiency. Come on Steve, it's time. Give shareholders a reason to believe you're actually working for us."
Approximately 20 years ago on 12/27/1999 the closing price of a share of QCOM was $85.06. Today’s closing price was $90.47. Only tulips bulbs during the Dutch Tulip Mania would have been a worse speculation.

we're going to be millions Ares by summer I promise
IPad pro gets 5G!
Semis with good CEO much better return than qualcomedy. Qualcomedy is the forever “future” stock.
The next smart move for QCOM is to acquire NEXCF to solidify its position in Augmented Reality the next mega play.As soon as October Apple and others are rumored to be coming out with AR glasses and AR will takeoff.
Zacks downgraded QCOM from OUTPERFORM to NEUTRAL. There's your BUY signal.

"I check the site, QCOM is a good value at PE=33, compared to industry at PE=38."
"Qcom must move forward with NXP or leverage is over. In addition, that combo itself brings Qcom to 80. If ago wants us so bad and believes their stock is in pop mode then lay down 95 & some avgo shares"
investors should be thrilled at the getting more dividends so not sure why the dip yesterday
Might end in green!
love this stock
What we really care about the ER is not ER itself but how the market will react to it....
"QCOM is such a good buy below $130, I am seriously considering breaking my rule about using margin."
"United States International Trade Commission suggests Apple infringed on Qualcomm patents....RTTNews.com) - As Apple's legal battle with Qualcomm continues to drag on, the United States International Trade Commission recommended that a trade judge find Apple guilty of infringing upon at least one of Qualcomm's patents.The decision from the ITC doesn't constitute a ruling, but rather a mere suggestion for judges. In many cases, however, the judges often follow what the ITC decides."
"Way too early too see the impact of Intel -Apple deal on Q. So many other factors have more impact on Q i.e stay decision on court order, implementation and success of 5G, automotive ,AI, IOT. Everyone wants Q technology?"
"In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but ""it makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban.""That goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products,” Rosenberg said. “There are many ways Apple could stop infringing our technology without affecting the public interest."""
"The deduction power of a so called Analyst, CJ Muse of Everdumb brokerage made this statement, I quote. “Over the next year, however, news of Apple’s progress will likely damage Qualcomm stock. Muse predicts Apple may launch its modem in 2024”. So, Muse claims Apples modem chips will be a threat to QCOM. His power of deduction is lacking big time. Did he consider that QCOM has a 3 year head start on Apple, and that when 2024 comes around QCOM will have increased their technological lead with their own Modem chips? For sure they will not be sitting still! So, I rate his comment as a grade “F” on this one. His next big whopper is – “Muse wrote that his team predicts that the shift to 5G phones is farther along than many believe”. I know of almost no one who is using 5G in a big way yet, and as far as Industrial Companies it has hardly started at all. My opinion, him and his team better go back to the drawing board, you can’t be this wrong, but they are!! This comment also gets an “F” grade!! One other fact to add QCOM will be down to 5Nm by 2024, who will Apple get to make their chips; QCOM and AMD has TSCM locked up for now and the future, is Cook going to build his own Fab, no... Folks, Think about it!"
Easy:EPS $6.5 x 20 P/E = $130Not rocket science
"It looks like QCOM is attempting to build a base around $65, its 200 day MA is about $60.8. I think if it holds above the $60.8, then we can start to build positions in QCOM again."
Lisa Su announces a $4B share buyback at AMD. Nice to see a little fighting back going on... time for QCOM to do a little fighting back of their own!
"YTD -8%. A big money earning company with a less 20 PE. The 5G is blooming in every corner in today’s life. Remember, 5g is just into commercial usage from 2019, 5g is not only limited in phone. This is a artificial intelligence era. 5g is needed in everything."

"Great article excerpts from motley fool...Connect with the 5G upgrade cycleWill Healy (Qualcomm): As the dominant maker of smartphone chipsets, Qualcomm will probably benefit as billions of consumers upgrade to 5G devices. So powerful is this upgrade cycle that Research and Markets predicted a compound annual growth rate of 87.8% through 2025!At least as things stand now, Qualcomm is able to reap significant benefits. As a result of this power, many of its long-standing issues have disappeared...My thoughts captured exactly. Good luck to all longs!"
"If you don't know Max-D Corp, check this company out...By the way, this is great news for MAXD shareholders: ""For the past several years, TIP and MAX-D have separately been working with Qualcomm, each under the Chip Giant's Developer program to bring their respective technologies into the Qualcomm Snapdragon chip set eco-system. Now, thankfully, both firms will double their strength by working together on their mutually compatible goals which will build even better overall products for end users.""https://developer.qualcomm.com/case-study/max-d-complex-hardware-upgrade-becomes-simple-software-upgrade"
"Can someone explain the following?: qcom is being accused of having a ""no license-no chips"" policy. But if an oem didn't pay the license fees, and therefore not buy chips, wouldn't they be infringing on the patents? Because aren't these essential patents that, without them, would render the phone inoperable? Just not understanding how it's being suggested that firms could elect to NOT use the technology enabled by qcom's patents. Thx."
LETS GO
"Stock buyback? From the failed merger of years ago, QCOM was supposed to use the unutilized cash to spend billions $$ on stock buybacks. I see that the number of shares outstanding now has hardly changed. What happened?"
They had some interesting insights about QCOM on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Lots of business are ongoing. Qcom is so active in multiple chip field. No way to down more. Patience is the only weapon to against WSJ. All the tortures are aiming to force you sell the bargains. Hold!!!!
"$QCOM $AMD $NVDA $TSM all great stocks, all getting hammered at same time. March is historically a bad month for stocks, soon we will be back to booming."
The government made qcoms importance to national security and America's technological future clear in the Broadcom fiasco. For the FTC to now be attempting to crush qcom just doesn't pass the smell test. What is really going on here?
whats going on after hours...gap up...big boys taked it down and now..filling the gap up..
"Added a lot more. Largest, position, really oversized at this point. Momentum downtrends in tech is over sold, this company is now basically a value company that's growing. Happy to get in cheaper."
"Frankly the story about Apple trying to make their own modem is yet another ploy to try to keep Qualcomm’s market cap from getting to high. That was the objective of the lawsuit as well. Its simply Apple’s way of denying a currency for Qualcomm to go out and make acquisitions as the wireless revolution continues. They effectively want to slow Qualcomm down in the hopes that they can catch up and compete in the future technologies driving 5G, 6G and beyond."
"Jacobs is out of the Qcom Board. Good ! All the board members must be replace along with management, but Qcom must remain independent"
Just added to my large position in $QCOM my position is now over 30% of my overall portfolio glta! Let’s get it guys!
"Last January Qcom approached CFIUS to investigate the buyout offer from AVGO in the interest of national security. I personally believe that the action was made to fend AVGO buyout interest. A lot have been said that the accusations were tied to China. 65% of Qcom business comes from China. So if you were in MOFCOM’s position, why would they cooperate and support the NXPI deal? Management inept decisions is now causing a chain of negative events."
"Based on tweets from impartial experts who are in the courtroom, qcom seems to at a minimum, be holding its own, and possibly scoring some big points at the trial. A lot of it is really technical, but that's how it seems. Not sure what this after hours reaction is."
"It's funny how we never heard any reference to Apple v. Pepper during the FTC trial. That's the one where the supreme court will decide whether the app store is a monopoly. That's right, a monopoly. So ironic. On the one hand crying that the much smaller qcom is bullying it, yet on the other hand, using their enormous size to bully everyone else. I've really built up such a distaste for Cook and the company at large."
this will go to 100 easily by Friday..smart people will not sell tomorrow because Intel is also out from 5g which is big achievement for Qcom.go qcom .let's have 90 tomorrow
Oh well the nice little run-up yesterday was fun. Back to bitter reality.
"Been tracking this puppy for sometime. When NXP deal was announced, the stock was around $50ish. from business perspective nothing has changed since then except the additional song and dance. The only additional drama today added is stock buy back. If you account for the 30 bil ( remember that the target, they may do or may not do this after all, factor your trust ). This many help the stock to pop up at most ~30% max from $50 original price. Given there is not diversification, competition getting stronger, SOC, ASP trending down along with recycling of phones per user getting longer and longer, is there any strong reason this should trade above ~$65 , including accounting for the multiples next year ?"
Listened to the CEO on Bloomberg and he didn’t seem overly concerned about the chip shortage and said if need be they could partner with TSM to facilitate production.
"Put aside the sink, seriously curious, does QCOM has comparable competitors in near future? I think it’s more important than short term down."
Looks like QCOM is recovering decently from the macro and micro troubles as of late. Any news on the latest from the court troubles?
"I think many people underestimate the changes that will occur as 5G takes hold. This is not just about a replacement for 3G and LTE. Many additional use cases will be platformed using 5G. Consider corporate and university campus', industrial and manufacturing plants, warehousing and etc. that are dependent on wifi today. Wifi is expensive to purchase, install and support. As companies move to update their wifi infrastructure they will find a better TCO with 5G. Of course that is depended on VZN, AT&T and other carriers pricing ""fairly"". If they don't many business may move to band 48. Which of course is already supported by QCOM."
"From what I know Apple is working together with the guys at QCOM to develop their ASIC. So actually both companies benefit. I don't get why people are dumping QCOM. But everyone is down today, so..."
SOX and Naz both about flat. qcom on the move. Hoping something like a stay is brewing!
My thoughts on apple vs qcom...Apple claims qcom is taxing them for apples innovation yet apple have no problem taxing everyone else for using apple App Store for developers innovation. Isn’t that the same thing? If that’s the case shouldn’t app developers stop paying apple too?
Al Weiss is not good at what he does
"Qualcomm's royalty regime was inheretedbfrom Nokia and Ericsson and dates back to the mid 90's. The structure of it has been carefully constructed by industry participants including Qualcomm over the last 20+ years. It is incomprehensable to me that a US judge with little, if any, understanding of the industry or its evolution is now seemingly on the verge of restructuring one of the most dynamic, competitive and robust industries on the planet. Let's hope judge Koh realizes that it ain't broken so dont try to fix it."
"Another day, another upgrade:DA Davidson raises to $177 with BUY/ADD strong recommendations.That's around 37% higher than today! Analysts do not usually like to go that far outside a current stock price, unless they really see strong upside potential."
How exactly did qcom violate an anti trust law?
What’s the biggest single day jump in this stock recently? Does it ever have 10% single day moves on good news or is it just gradual? Av at 142 so hoping for the odd big jump here and there!
Looks like the hedge funds have the shorts over the barrel today
"QCOM - Qualcomm Target Raised at Evercore on Boost From Apple 5G RampQualcomm’s price target was raised to $140 from $120 at Evercore ISI, which wrote that even after a recent advance in the stock price, the company’s growth potential was “still very apparent.”• Shares have more than doubled off a March low, but there are “a number of catalysts remaining,” including Apple’s 5G ramp and “Huawei restrictions driving share toward Qualcomm’s customers”• NOTE: Oct. 6, Apple to Hold Online Event to Unveil 5G IPhones on Oct. 13 (1)• Analyst C J Muse added that revenue from radio frequency products and stock buybacks “all provide a strong pipeline of growth” starting in the fourth quarter and moving through “at least” 2022• Outperform rating; QCOM is a “top pick” for Evercore• NOTE: Earlier, Qualcomm Will Be Go-To Chipmaker as 5G Gains Momentum: BI Focus"
"Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock, the next big catalyst is 5G. Considering the massive rollout we’re about to see, its chips will be under sizable demand.In fact, Qualcomm expects global smartphone makers to ship up to 450 million 5G handsets in 2021, and another 750 million in 2022. We also have to remember Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones will be powered by QCOM 5G modem chips.As a result, Qualcomm will benefit because phones will therefore need more chips.“We exit the fiscal year having successfully executed on our strategic priorities: helping to drive the commercialization of 5G globally, completing a number of important anchor license agreements and executing well across our product road map,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf, as I pointed out the other day."
Underperforming again vs most other semi chips. Laughable on how this behaves
Huwawei has not settled with QCOM over the same NON payment of Licensing fees as APPLE. did a couple weeks ago. I belive as part of a TRUMP sanctions settlement with Huwawei these FEES to QCOM wil have to be paid!
The story that China is talking about a specific operating platform and not all models is a made up story by AAPL. The Chinese mean all models are part of their decision.

"to be honest, qcom is very good at engineering and innovation. but management screws up everything."
"I wonder if AAPL has done this yet....Qualcomm looked set to deliver a major boost to US operators’ 5G ambitions, after completing a test of data calls combining mmWave with sub-6GHz spectrum over a standalone (SA) 5G network.The trials were conducted using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 5G modem and antenna module in a smart device form-factor and, the company stated, showcased the modem’s capabilities “to aggregate low-, mid- and high-bands across key global combinations”.Qualcomm said spectrum aggregation such as the blending of mmWave and sub-6 GHz frequencies is critical for multi-gigabit speeds and massive capacity which can be used on 5G devices even in crowded venues and transit hubs.SVP and GM of Qualcomm Technologies Durga Malladi explained the calls enable consumers and enterprises around the world “to make the most of 5G networks and devices, especially in traditionally congested, bandwidth-hungry spaces”.The company claims to be a leader in the 5G mmWave space and while the spectrum is gaining some traction globally, to date it has mostly been a US play.T-Mobile US rolled out mmWave in June 2019 and recently unveiled plans to introduce it for in-building and private network deployments. Rival Verizon started using the spectrum in 2018, and AT&T claimed a world-first in conducting a test call using mmWave in collaboration with Qualcomm in the same year."
The fact that NXPI now popping more than 10 percent in two days shows that it was an expensive acquisition for QCOM. That is why the pre-market is in red.
Some detailed and informed readhttps://futurumresearch.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-iphone-ban/
I just for the record I recall the last few times as Qualcomm started to tank pre-earnings we had good results only to have our losses wiped out and brought back to what it was before the start of the tank. the manipulation never ends.
"SA has a lengthy article out, making the case for QCOM's future, with a lot of emphasis on QCOM's intellectual property and licensing fees contrary to Citi bought and paid for propaganda... 5G is not dead!!! The heading of the piece is Qualcomm: 5G plus Patent Portfolio equals Big Upside"
"This is a stock market and there's buyers and sellers. QCOM is definitely going to benefit from 5G. A solid beat followed by the stock slide early today is a great way to accumulate shares. IMHO, QCOM will be over a $100 by end of June and over $125 when APPL launches 5G iphones. Thoughts."

It will be a very interesting day today as shorts have been going over the earnings report and know they must cover.

Back to 120 in no time you will see.
First bar to overcome in an antitrust suit is that someone was harmed. The judge in this case failed to show that in her ruling. FTC missed the mark and that’s why this will ultimately be overturned although I’m guessing it will need to go to the Supreme Court for that.
"In this instance, QCOM is the pure play of 5G, and is extremely undervalued. Even if they give conservative guidance, this stock is over $100 by sometime early April at latest. I still stick to $115 by July and $130 by year end if not more."

"NIO's new ET7 sedan looks absolutely awesome. Makes Tesla model S look very dated (and it is in terms of design). Best of all is this:The interior is designed with a ""second living room"" concept. The car comes with Nio's in-vehicle artificial intelligence, NOMI, which provides infotainment and navigation functions. It has a 12.8-inch AMOLED central display and uses a third-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon automotive cockpit platform.And people were worried that Apple will design their own 5G modem? In like 5 years? By then I see QCOM playing is such a large field in the automotive and AI space they will not be able to keep us with demand."
So dividend payout is tomorrow? What if you bought today?
131 please
"Rosenblatt is one of the more fair securities houses out there (not controlled by a trading desk) - so for those following stocks always look for that analyst. Kevin Cassidy is a balanced guy who does his homework. After yesterday's ER, he raised to $180 on QCOM which seems about right based on mid-point guidance. We of course use upper range of guidance and optimism which puts PPS at around $200. If and when QCOM again beats next quarter this will get raised again accordingly. However, a fair analyst has to use mid-point guidance even through QCOM has been beating regularly lately. Cassidy is a 5 Star analyst (103rd out of 7,489) on tip ranks with an average return of 29% and success at 73% (unlike 3,250 ranked Rod hall with a 50% success rate!)."

"QCOM helps by winning 5-G in Europe; copy and paste below....Leading chip maker Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM, together with Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGY and BMW recently won an enduring legal battle over the use of 5G technology in vehicles across Europe, per Bloomberg. The triumph came after European Union member states repudiated prevailing rules that proposed WiFi-based technology for future connected cars.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipset built on baseband technology. The company has been working hard to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with several technological feats and state-of-the-art product launches.Side note- Zacks rating on QCOM is insane, I wonder what they are smoking???"
"On the other side of the pandemic is exponential growth for QCOM, why because of Asia. Asia is leapfrogging the USA in 5G and a large amount of the impending infrastructure stimulus package to come will need to be spent on 5G for the demand in communication and transportation to make up ground for what has been stalled under the COVID-19 crisis. At this point in time, the USA should know that any divergence from stepping on the gas on 5G growth could pose many issues to its world standing in leadership in advanced technologies.QCOM = value play, enormous high reward."
"Low PE, rising dividend, rising profits, rising revenue, incredible amount of 5G exposure, embarrassment of riches in 5G and mobile patents. This is GROWTH and VALUE. Never held so much of one stock in my portfolio. Over 20% at the low of 124."
want to guess tomorrow price?$120. Now we know AAPL want to do 5G...Refresh rate and license fees (and a few back pay)I know you people think Media will kill QCOM.. But licence fee...A 5G phones still need to backward compatible with 4G (or even 3G) because not everywhere has 5G.So you know QCOM stands to gain..$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Who listened to the meeting at Barron’s yesterday????
"https://articles.marketrealist.com/2019/04/qualcomm-gets-multiple-upgrades-after-apple-dispute-settlement/ Upgrades go from 82 to 95 $. Looking to the midpoint of it, it’s ok for the midterm. Think the next wave of upgrades to come September, latest year end. Still think, 120 to come mid 2020. The risk/reward is now outstanding."

Just go up now for shucks sake !!!
"Why am i getting so many mail?Ive voted three times already, all against."
The timing of this ruling is highly suspicious as if Koh is directly trying to sabotage current administration’s sanction on Huawei and to protect the U.S tech leadership. The licensees that she orders renegotiation are all foreign and mostly Chinese. Her blatant disregard for our national interest and security will eventually come back to Haunt her career
So what is the strategy here if you have Qcom stock? Hold it till today’s trading and sell; or keep on holding it?
I think this is the best time for Mr. Jacob to buy Qualcomm.1. The commercial war will end soon2. The intellectual property will be respected by China3. The value of the shares are very low4. 5g is coming soon5. He has a very good relationship with Mr. Tim Cook. They could reach an agreement before the FTC decision6. This way you could avoid any decision against future patents.7. Mr. Jacob does not like the form of royalties that Qualqomm proceedsI see it as a possible solution before facing the FTC and thus have Apple as a customer.
"nxp deal is done, history it is over no turn back"
Bloomberg reporting that the CIFIUS investigation may take up to 75 days and looks like it will go beyond 30 days.
"Load up. Citi would look to add to Qualcomm positions, calls Apple report 'no biggie' Citi analyst Christopher Danely said he expects upside to both results and guidance when Qualcomm (QCOM) reports earnings next month and he would look to add to positions on weakness in a note partially titled ""Qualcomm Stock Down on Apple Trying to Do Its Own Modems. We Still Expect a Repeat of Samsung So No Biggie."" Bloomberg's report that Apple (AAPL) has started its internal cellular modem chip development for 5G is weighing on Qualcomm shares but he has written about Apple going internal before, noted Danely. He continues to think Apple will end up like Samsung (SSNLF), meaning that it will use its own modems for low to mid-range phones and keep Qualcomm for its high-end devices, added the analyst."
"As usual, I am late to the party. How I miss these parties even when I think I am ""on top' of all news is a mystery to me."
Zacks has upgraded QCOM now to a Buy.
"Compare with XLNX, no matter from what standpoint, Qcom is much better but the stock price is much lower. it should move up quickly and beat XLNX by the end of this year. Target price $125 IMO"

"Apple inroads into china, trade talks to be finalized, qcom sells apple it's chips."
I am very confidence on qcom lead in 5G market. Hugh market.

"My best guess, which I’ve mentioned before is that the PE contraction of not only QCOM but Apple and others has to do with higher taxes coming. This is why I said QCOM won’t get a higher forward PE of 20X. We have an incompetent president on many levels in which Americans will pay a hefty price for."

"More on Iphone 13...Orders up 25% over Iphone 12.100 million Iphone 13 order.....that is according to one analyst’s reading of the supply-chain tea leaves. It would compare with an initial build of 80 million iPhone 12 units in 2020.The next iPhone lineup likely won’t be unveiled until September, but Apple begins to work with its suppliers months in advance. If its initial iPhone 13 order is in fact 25% larger than it was for the iPhone 12, that is a sign that management expects the 5G-driven smartphone upgrade cycle to last well into next year.Wall Street already expects 2021 to be a huge year for iPhone sales. The consensus forecast is for about 220 million units, just short of 2015’s record 231 million. That was when the larger-screen iPhone 6 came out."

"Qualcomm gets 4G license for Huawei, but not 5G, says KeyBanc 10:37 QCOM KeyBanc analyst John Vinh says the firm's checks are confirming media reports that Qualcomm has received an export license that will allow it to ship 4G chips to Huawei, but notes ""significant skepticism"" that Huawei's suppliers will be able to procure a 5G export license. The analyst views this as a modest positive for Qualcomm given he expects Qualcomm to gain an incremental share at Huawei on 4G handsets. It's unlikely this license will represent a source of near-term upside to estimates, but likely to be modestly incremental next year, Vinh says. Longer term, Vinh believes Qualcomm is likely to be better positioned if only 4G-related licenses are granted to Huawei given its stronger footprint at other OEMs. The analyst made no change to his Overweight rating or $175 price target."

The options market is expecting either another delay or an AVGO win. The out of the money puts are dropping and the out of the money calls are unmoved. So the options don't expect a quick anti-AVGO ruling or the puts would be holding their value.
This is a rockstar company ahead. Way over-reaction. On sale today and maybe a bit more ahead. A great entry point.

"Big green day, small rise. Little red day, big drop. Qualcomdey for sure."
"If I was the CEO of QCOM I would make sure that AAPL products never saw the light of day as concerns the Snapdragon 710. AAPL products would become like Blackberry and just fade away. I would still want the money though, that AAPL owes the company."
"Down in strong market, i think it has to do with Huawei.according to Ross ""On May 20, we issued an order that prevented American technology from being used in Huawei-designed chips. That led them to do some evasive measures. They were going through third parties,"" Ross told ""Mornings with Maria."" ""The new rule makes it clear that any use of American software or American fabrication equipment to produce things for Huawei is banned and requires a license.These rule must apply to Mediatek too since Mediatek uses TSM to manufacture chips, TSM uses amat and klac equipments. So i wonder did mediatek have the license to supply huawei?"
"Apple still has to design, test and manufacture the chips. This is over blown."
"From Qualcomm's site: ""Xiaomi Mi 9"" Featuring a Snapdragon 855 Mobile Platform. (According to today's article, Xiaomi is removed from a US government blacklist). Seems this should bolster shares, although article released early today, May-12."
Why does Yahoo still show 4+ % dividend it’s a lot lower now due to the price appreciation.
Broadcom today or tomorrow morning at max need to announce a new $85 counter offer if they r serious about Qcom. That was a bully move reducing offer to $79 which might have angered shareholders and could work against them in the vote.
apple and qcom should be talking and eventually come to a compromise....
A week ago i told you guys that this stock is heading down to $50 because 5G will not roll out in significant quantity until 3-5 years from now. Hope some of you listened :) And now with Huawei not allowed to buy from QCOM this stock will hit $50 a lot faster than I initially thought.
Let the times roll.
"Buy back guys, working harder man, need to buy all 30B before apple settlement news come out ;) ;) :) so that both QCOM and long make $$$$"
Earnings MAY 1st ! Lots of good news. Imo this is best stock to own in 2019.

"""If you look at ZTE it sells around 45 million smartphones per year globally, and almost half of them have Qualcomm chips,"" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.""So if you look at an average of 25 dollars per chip set that's close to half a billion dollars in revenue.""it's critical for QCOM having ZTE back in the business."
"Qualcomm is going to keep climbing past $175 per share and further, there’s a big reason why Chinese companies wanted to acquire Qualcomm, and that’s because of it’s ongoing innovation and brilliance. Qualcomm will by the 5G leader for the U.S., and the rest of the other countries will always depend in it’s technologies"
Last week mad money -> Qualcomm technical analysis indicates break out (crammer said this will happen after a slight dip);strong 5G company with early June 3 dividend; it is worth holding it till June 3-4.
"Nice buyback, now that you don't get the talent of my brother, an NXP engineer. Compare the percentage of shares (using current market cap) reeled-in by QCOM to those by $WDC in it's program. QCOM $30 billion out of $106 MC is a 28% reduction. WDC $5 billion out of $16.75MC is a 30% reduction.In either case, and with consideration of each company's current ""headwinds"", the share price is too low."
"Qualcomm should really consider increasing their chip prices by 10%. Why?Q2 2019 QCT revenue = 3722 millions USDQ2 2019 QTL operating profit = 674 millions USDIf they lose 50% of the QTL profit, the loss is 337 millions. This should get offset by 10% hike in chip revenue, which will purely get translated into PBT.As QCOM chips are the best (especially true for 5G), I guess customers would pay the premium, because % hike in phone's price will be negligible.Any caveats here?"
"Wow! Look what Sharp just released in Japan…..watch competitors soon follow. Sharp released a God-level smartphone: AQUOS R61-inch camera, Leica lens, 2000 nit 1～240Hz refresh rate 2K+ OLED screen, Qualcomm 3D Sonic Max fingerprint sensor, Snapdragon 888 processor. 5000mAh，"

What an excellent bear trap!
EPS beat is nominal...but im sure everyone knew that already...guidance during conference call is whats important...1. Share Buyback with new revenue flows?2. Dividend is already healthy at 4.5%...will it increase the dividend?I am long and those are the only 2 things im concerned about...Revenue appreciation and EPS are important but I think its steady as she goes on those 2 fronts...
Unless you are given votes to equal your shares I have no doubt there are way more people holding less than a 1000 shares as opposed to those holding more so I see this vote going blue. Most stock holders are not whales and cannot wait. IMO.
Simple really. Either the current board solves the Apple dispute or NXP acquisition by March 6 or hello new Broadcom board. Either way...the stock price goes higher from here.
"Why all the downgrades. Qcom is sitting on a hoard of cash and more is coming from Apple. it can raise the div,buy backs, pay debt and so much more . Better deals are coming then NXP. I see  soon."
"Despite recent speculation about decreasing demand from Apple for semiconductor manufacturing services, the latest news from the supply chain has indicated TSMC will start shipping chips for the next-generation iPhones by the end of May ahead of schedule, with the foundry set to see major increases in output from its advanced processes. The Taiwanese foundry has also recently obtained rush orders from Qualcomm for making the US client’s high-end 5G chips. For wireless connectivity, Digitimes recently interviewed Ignion CEO Carles Puente to learn more about the company’s Virtual Antenna – a small off-the-shelf antenna booster that he says simplies the design of devices and shorten their time-to-market."

"INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIPThe public number hasn't changed much, but consider this we are at according to Yahoo 79.91% % held by Institutions for a while now, does anyone think for one minute that we wouldn't see the PPS cratering if they were bailing, or thought the future wasn't as bright as the sun? IMO based upon the clutter and tape painting we are experiencing they are continuing to try to accumulate to even higher percentages and in all likelihood already have, because EVERYTHING I can find to read about 5G indicates that this is a 5 - 7 expansion into this new technology that is going global and for those that are thinking just cellphones, do your homework 5G is going to impact EVERYTHING we touch see and do in the future and the magnitude is staggering and remember the words of our CEO Steve Mollenkopf from the recent WSJ interview... ""THIS IS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MARKET CAP. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE KEY TECHNOLOGY THAT ENABLES THAT"" (I LOVE IT!!!) the potential of the entire globe using 5G for all the applications that have been revealed so far and remember that people laughed at Apple when it was down around $10.00 and Amazon when they were selling books, but who's laughing now?Those that put in small amounts that made them multi millionaires, that's who!GLTA"
my memory is correct Qualcomm originated the wearable prior namely The Watch Flash iWatch blah blah blah I wonder how much Qualcomm brings in on that royalty?

"So I'm totally wrong at this point. QCOM is actually outperforming the SOX. That's nuts on the heels of the Koh decision.....well, in my view anyway. Thrilled by it, but equally surprised."
Haha I must be one of the few remaining folks who are actually optimistic about the stock. Good luck to my fellow longs!
It's a long way from saying you are going to build a new modem to actually building a state of the art modem that can compete with the competitor you are buying licensed technology from.

"Qualcomm on March,5 releases plan to deploy Qualcomm Sound, a new standard for wireless audio solutions. The standard includes criteria for audio quality as well as audio latency, an important factor within the ever growing gaming sector."
Any ideas as to when we should expect the verdict on the stay since all the parties have responded. Will it be before the October 4th date?
Qcom is in right place right time
"I agree with the idea that current management (and board) just doesn't get or care for shareholders - it's been too long in the cellar. Time for a change. The effort put out to keep the current board is astonishing (multiple live phone call and advertising etc), too bad this much effort and energy could not be shown to improve shareholder value!"

"George said 27% growth in non-smartphone biz, and most patents are non-SEP .. this is the most undervalued stock in tech."
"Worst performing semi chip stock today after stellar earnings and outlook. But we know the reason, which is, according to the market, this is nothing but a cell phone chip supplier and so if they pounce on Apple like they have today, gotta pound Qualcomm much worse then any other semi companies. I’m longer term as you all know but this is still just an awful stock still since Jan earnings, just pitiful"
"I would buy QCOM on this “gift”; funny how they put this article out the night before options expire....hmm ........how is Apple allowed to hire all Qualcomm engineers to build their wireless chips? Seems illegal and doesn’t QCOM have 1000 patents? Imagine Qualcomm hiring all Apple’s employees and building IPhones, IPads, etc."
QCOM is so undervalued. QCOM is the front runner for 5G in every category including autonomous driving.

"The 5G infrastructure budget, $300B, will benefit QCOM greatly"
it's a great stock to mess with. so much controversy all the time. the shrewd play it up and down. dead money until all supply issues subside and then a huge gap up. the big boys keep shorting and profiting. they will create the bottom and buy it up. unfortunately it will be the sheep who pay high and get slaughtered.
If the board of directors believe the stock bid by Broadcom undervalued the company....then why isn't the stock trading at least at the bid value?

"5-star analyst rates QCOM an Overweight (i.e. Buy), while raising the price target from $160 to a Street high of $185."
Anyone else suspect that the government leaned on Apple/QCOM to settle? Kind of weird how they settled when going after each other with knives out. Also - does anyone think Q will be a takeover play for a larger tech co? I’m hoping no because I think they’ll do much better without a takeover. Comments welcome.
"Consider: QCOM is better and safer than even the best fast growth utility stocks, such as NEE and WEC. A- financial rating, 16 straight years of paying and increasing dividends, with an average div. drowth rate of 27.5% in that time! The current ~3.5% dividend, even with the huge price jump- is higher. Growth is faster than any utilty stock. QCOM is the tech version of the old widows/orphans ute..!"
This stock will go up. What a cheap buy!
"Qcom will buy 20-30 Billion of share buyback if they do not close on the NXPI deal and boost earnings by $ 1.50 per share either way, ie or with the purchase and the Pres reiterated earnings of $ 5.25 with David Faber of CNBC.So what is the issue here.Someone please respomd"
"5G chipsets need to use Qualcomms SEPs ,Standard essential patents!! Qcom will license apple to use their patents for a price that will more than buying the chips from QCOM.

Very good Bal Sheet, spending 25% of sales towards R n D, leader in more important then ever 5G space, share count has dropped by almost 10% recently, solid dividend n a PE of less than 20 based on forward looking PE. This stock should easily be in the upper $90s at a minimum. Get it while on sale!!"
"By creating a way to reduce the processing required to do visual AI computations and thereby reducing the power requirements, size, and cost of AI chips, Qualcomm hopes to create mass market devices that can be deployed in lower cost and higher quantity devices, and without sacrificing AI quality. If it can accomplish this, the number of devices with self contained capability will skyrocket, relieving the strain on edge computing and allowing it to do more important processing functions. This is a win for Qualcomm, and potentially a win for all forms of new, visually “smart” products. While Qualcomm is not the only silicon vendor in this race, its R&D efforts should put it ahead of many, and it should benefit significantly from its leadership. "

In my opinion, the negative legal outcome is almost all priced in for QCOM whereas Apple is taking a big gamble to the down side if they lose and a win will be a moral win only and will not benefit its share price. Apple’s Board should step in and prevent their management for insisting on such an emotional path gambling with investors money for personal spite and vindictive purposes."

"Smartphone shipments in China doubled yoy in Q1....driven by 5G upgrades.￼Smartphone shipments in China during Q1 doubled year-on-year, with 5G models accounting for a greater portion of the total, government figures showed.The China Academy of Information and Communications (CAICT) reported total shipments grew 101.5 per cent to 96.2 million units, of which 71.3 per cent were 5G compatible compared with 29.5 per cent in Q1 2020.In the recent period, vendors introduced 64 new 5G models and local manufacturers produced 88.5 per cent of total smartphones shipped, up marginally.A major factor driving growth in China’s 5G shipments is rapidly declining prices: Counterpoint Research data showed nearly a third of compatible devices sold in January were priced below $300.Shipments in Q1 2020 were impacted by Covid-19 (coronavirus) restrictions, falling 34.7 per cent year-on-year to 47.7 million units.The global smartphone market returned to growth in the final quarter of 2020, with IDC figures showing shipments rose 4.3 per cent to 385.9 million units."
"5G Honor 50 series officially to use Snapdragon 778GAfter cutting ties with Huawei last November and announcing a partnership with Qualcomm in January, Honor has now confirmed plans to introduce a Snapdragon-powered smartphone in June.The next flagship Honor Magic phone will also use Qualcomm powerThe Chinese brand revealed this morning that its upcoming Honor 50 series will use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G chipset, which was announced earlier this week as a small step down from the Snapdragon 780G that still retains 5G support.The Honor 50 lineup will be announced in full next month. The company is teasing “ground-breaking features and aesthetic design.” It also says the devices will be “industry-leading” products.In addition to that, Honor has confirmed that it’s developing a premium flagship device to be launched under the Honor Magic series. That product will feature “the most premium Qualcomm chipset” and “unleash remarkable image processing capabilities.”Both the Honor 50 series and Honor Magic flagship are expected to ship with Google services on board, making them both potential candidates for the best Android phones of 2021 list. Honor confirmed back in January that it was in talks with Google and, although nothing has been announced yet, the brand said at the time that it expected ties to ‘resume soon.’"
"Instead of buy back, they should have used the money for data center chip or some other promising developmental efforts."
"in this type of market, you have to have a conviction on the stocks you buy. QCOM for me is such a stock. There is no way I can justify holding let's say Tesla because the evaluation is nuts. Not this stock. They will not only supply over 60% of the chips used in 5G technology, but they will also continue to rake in big bucks on royalties and that is the key. They will have a flood of cash to throw at R&D for future technologies and to increase the dividend probably double-digit for at least then next 5 years. In other words, your original investment right here right now could be making 10% plus 5 years from no while the stock appreciation will probably be at least 100% in 3-5 years' time."

Another down day most likely. It is a full court press from analysts like Rob Hall to take this company down. Ask yourself one question however. Do these analysts have one shred of evident that Apple will be successful in designing a competitive chip to what QCOM will have by 2023. Do they know how diversified QCOM will be by 2023 in other areas where if they were to lose all the business from Apple more than compensate from this loss (IoT is growing by double digits and by 2023 along projections it will be double the business QCOM does with Apple right now). Also ask yourself why not a single analyst has not come out and be skeptical on how successful Apple will be in just two years time in getting a competitive modem. Intel sure didn't and buying their failed effort doesn't automatically mean they are good to go. I mean it took them 10 years to design and produce the M1 chip but magically they will design and produce a 5G modem with the right packaging to fit their phones.if you need the money in the next few weeks then bail. If you can wait for a year or more use the dividends to buy more. This is how you make money in the market not moving in and out of great companies.

Poll:How much % will go up monday!?I say 4.5% !!
Qualcomm is on the way to go bankruptcy. Part of the reason is government. It shuts the door to sell chips to China. This will wake China up. 5 years later you will see a brand new “Qualcomm” built by Chinese. The 200billion each year domestic market can easily make this happen. Years ago the government banned to export Chips for super computer to China. Now china’s super computers are ranks world top 2. The chips are purely made in China. I wonder why the government always fee good about himself. Ban the international business put self in danger.

The so-called new IPhone is not 5G capable. These phones will be obsolete in 6 months when Android 5G phones hit the market — almost powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips and modems. Apple will be late to the party as always.
Qcom shares will be at $120 in 12 months!
Why this board is so quiet? Nobody enjoy this ride?
"the best semi-conductor company next to broadcom... sell intel, sell amd, sell nvidia, BUY QUALCOMMM!!!!!!"
Look at the huge volume! It's obvious that QCOM path to 200 is real.
"Death, taxes, and computer chips..."
"I think if CFIUS believes the technology is that important that it need to remain in house, then the value if QCOM will in the long term reflect that. IMHO."
Apple will settle shortly as their problems escalate and their 2020 plan to deploy 5G is recognized for the mistake it is. QCOM and not Intel is Apples only chance. This will mean $10 billion to QCOM and a large contract (with new terms) going forward. It will goose QCOM share price but Apple has much bigger international and domestic demand issues (Apple tax has finally caught up with phone sales numbers).
I am aiming to a slightly bigger shareholders if price keeps dropping !!! :) Sorry for your loss!!!
Good to see this come back today.
"I am going to add to my position if the stock price is in the green on Monday. The price is cheap. Once the FTC case and the Apple case are resolved, it should be north of $75 per share."
Let's put this in perspective. Let's completely ignore phones for a second. QCOM Quarterly iOT revenue of $1 billion is a approaching 33% of all of AMD's quarterly revenue. Let that sink in for a second.
glad I added lot at 82 range
"Taiwan struck by magnitude 6.2, 5.8 earthquakes 3 minutes apart - #MU #TSM #QCOM #AMD #NVDAShockwaves from temblors felt across Taiwan, no injuries reported so far"
triple digits coming soon
I had to sell my QCOM late last year to make a big purchase. I'm happy it pulled back today and I could buy back in to this great company
$8.5 billion exchanged hands today!! Amazing... it will be $100 after earnings
Congrats to all who kept the candles burning. Freakin' great quarter and even better guidance. That's it. That's the message.
"One has to ask themselves why, after the NDRC settlement, is Huawei not paying royalties to Qualcomm based on the settled rate and holding out. Perhaps the U.S government just got fed up with their shenanigans and took its actions to send a message about how serious it is about protecting the intellectual property rights of U.S. companies."
"In December 1991, Qualcomm issued its IPO and sold 4 million shares of its common stock at $16 per share on the Nasdaq. As of November 2019, after adjusting for stock splits, Qualcomm's stock price has increased by a colossal 11,954% since it went public in 1991."
"Ara, this will never get a forward PE of even 25X. Despite almost certainly of growing somewhere on average between 25-30% for the next few years, they refuse to see this as anything but a cell phone chip supplier and cyclical, hence a 16.5X forward PE on 2023 numbers at the current moment. I think the best you will ever see as a forward PE on this for the remainder of the year is 20X. By the way, I believe the true numbers they’ll wind up doing for this fiscal year, which ends in September will be $8.60 and for 2023 will be $11, at least. Of course when they report in late October to finish their fiscal year and do $8.60, the idiot analysts will have them doing like $9.80. Part of that will be on Qualcomm’s guidance as well so I can’t entirely blame it on them. The market should be ahead of this though and know the real number for 2023 will be closer to $11 as I said. So it’s possible with $9.80 to end this fiscal year and a forward PE of 20X going into the 2022 Earnings report the stock could be $190-200 but forget about a forward PE of 25X, much less 30X, they just won’t give it this valuation no matter what."
"If this drops in 140 zone, this is a buy tomorrow. This was a strong report, not big deal on the sales miss."
So how does this work? A us company can by bcom but bcom can’t buy qcom???
"STOCKHOLM, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Veoneer will cooperate with Qualcomm Technologies on software for its driver assistance systems, the auto technology .......... "
"Does anybody have a number for how many connections from the Edge to the Cloud there will be for IoT? Smartphones are one thing, but throughout the economy and it's IT, a Snapdragon required to connect to the web, right, from each device, a robot at GM, traffic cameras, checkout stations. I wonder what that number would be in a few years, even next year. J.C.Muse? No. But I think Qualcomm has a good idea since they're going to be providing the processors and modems to the Edge, and they're hiring people from diverse industries to inform about that."
It’s coming. From INSIDE
"Attached names of judges in the panel...This month's Ninth Circuit motions panel (consisting of Judge Mary M. Schroeder, Judge William C. Canby, and Judge Morgan B. Christen) now has all the briefing in front of it to decide on Qualcomm's motion for a partial stay of the FTC's antitrust remedies."
"NXP sells JV stake ahead of Qualcomm takeover https://seekingalpha.com/news/3342069?source=ansh $NXPI, $QCOM"
QCOM should buy AMD. QCOM needs to expand to include server chips because that is the growth area for many many years as data centers continue to grow and expand their services. Data will continue to increase and companies can't keep up with the demand for data centers. They need to buy AMD while they have the upper hand on Intel.
Guessing CJ might have overlooked this when he said 5G has peaked...or run its course... or whatever stupid thing he said. Considering 5G opens the door to low latency applications this is one of MANY that will have a decade of growth (across the world!). Imagine the data that can be retrieved and used for efficiency and safety by governments. It will blow your mind... QCOM is the best way to invest in this future.https://velodynelidar.com/blog/qualcomm-smart-cities-program-velodyne-lidar-navvis/

was guidance kind of soft?
I see why qcom didn't want to sell all this upside to broadcom...75$ bucks here we go yes....

nice to end the day on a high. I'm sure we will be close to 143 tomorrow
"If you chair a board and your leadership team just settled a $4.6 Billion and pulled in a multibillion dollar six year contract, You give them a bonus. End of story. $3.5 million is about 0.076% of just the settlement (not the contract). There's still $4,596,500,000 left to benefit stockholders and invest in the future. (Yes, I want to see a buyback announced)."
good luck to the shorts......settlement equals $65 buck price tag.....
Has there ever been a company embroiled in so many worldwide lawsuits and royalties squabbles year after year after year????
Missed Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Tech Summit 2018? It’s All In Herehttps://www.anandtech.com/show/13729/missed-qualcomms-snapdragon-tech-summit-its-all-in-here
"qcom will be held down untill the in the money calls, for which the big money is on the wrong side of the trade, have been flushed."
I find it interesting people blasting Apple. I own both QCOM and Apple. Qcom has been a nice dividend stock while Apple has been a superb growth stock. Don't develop a loyalty to a stock. You are in it to make money not to fall in love with a company.
"Folks this new ruling is a slam dunk; comments from Barrons below....In a note to clients Tuesday, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso wrote that after securing license agreements with every major handset original equipment manufacturing and the apparent conclusion to this case, Qualcomm’s licensing revenue, “is more secure now than ever before.” Caso noted that because the company recently wrapped up two more licensing agreements, a negative decision would have had a muted effect on the company, but that in winning the appeal, the issue is essentially over. His estimate for annual licensing revenue is now $5.5 billion.The Ninth Circuit ruled that Qualcomm didn’t breach antitrust laws because the company isn’t required to license rival semiconductor suppliers.“The panel held that Qualcomm’s patent-licensing royalties and ‘no license, no chips’ policy did not impose an anticompetitive surcharge on rivals’ modem chip sales,” the Ninth Circuit panel wrote in the judicial opinion. “Instead, these aspects of Qualcomm’s business model were ‘chip-supplier neutral’ and did not undermine competition in the relevant markets.”"

"I just saw a cnbc video in which an analyst said the whole 5g marketing thing is a bunch of ""hooey"" on wall street and that apple isn't actually behind, and nor is intel, and that the marketing of 5g is way out over its skis vs the reality of 5g. Wow, either there's a LOT of misinformation out there or some wildly differences of opinion or both. The telco's have already deployed 5g in certain cities and within defined areas as I understand it. And reports are that speeds are incredibly faster. Also, there have been numerous stories published that say apple is indeed behind and only has a few options. Only thing I can think of where the opinions are this diverse are the price of oil and tesla's stock price. lol."
Going back up :) lets see if we finish above $145
"What a great buying opportunity.. sorry for those who where in before the dip, now yo all will have to wait a bit to get it back. But you will :)"
"It’s over, accept it"
"Just buy at will on open. This is an oversold beta stock about to reverse course opening with a gap up. Sellers, shorters and FOMOs will all want in at what it is a bottom, despite the gap up!"

"Let's make sure that everyone understands the facts.1) CFIUS only regulates foreign purchases of US based companies. Thus, CFIUS has NO SAY in the matter once AVGO becomes a US based company.2) CFIUS cannot dictate the corporate structure of a US based company - ie private equity or anything else."
"I think the NXPI deal gets China's approval next week. My basis? I had a vision. But then again, I keep having these visions-----since January 2018 that's when they first appeared.

looooaded up. Long-term hold. The entire advanced world is moving towards ground-breaking 5G technologies and this is literally the leader. Awwwwwwwl-in.
oh thank God it's up 4 1/2%.will see 135 next week. nice

microsoft new smart phone Microsoft duo have snapdragon 855 processor and will be in market shortly.
"My take on all of this is simple=there is too much money at stake here to let this go. After all that's happened it's obvious that Qcom is the company to buy, the question is who will buy it? My April 13th $68 call is in effect. We shall see."
"Pardon my memory lapse, but there have been so many things dramatically affecting this share price. With that said, what was/were the catalyst(s) taking this from the Sept high to present? I believe the stock was in the 60'ish area and earnings pulled it down a good amount. Also, obviously the overall market decline has contributed. But what was the thing(s) that took it form the Sept high to the pre-earnings price in the low 60's?? I'm sure it was apple related but scrolling through news has been a chore. I'm blaming this on too much eating and drinking. Thanks Board."
I wish intel could buy Qualcomdey. I would raise my both hands and say yes. 150 would be way good enough.
based on fridays proceedings and cnet article..lastchance to buy at 51
This is a great company with a very good future! Holding good company stocks LONG like QCOM enabled me to retire early! :)
QCOM is a strong buy hands down. Waiting for some mutual fund to go into sell mode and price to lower a bit. I have few QCOM stocks and want to pile more.
"QCOM says in filing EPS going to be +$2 a share, unclear whether 1 time or ongoing (currently $1.56, so going to $3.56), i.e. +128%. Stock trading at 45x 1.56 (70.45). Even if multiple falls to 30X (check what historic multiple is). 30x $3.56 = $106 stock price"
Think - Apple worth 2T. Qcom gets IP for every iPhone sold - this has to worth way more than current value
every autonomous car will have Qualcomm technologies in it no exceptions..

"Is TSM a precursor to the rest of the semis? Once again, TSM gets  on, but I actually expect it to recover today’s losses and be back to $125 next week and $130 within 2-3 weeks. Qualcomm remains an underperforming stock until proven otherwise. Probably goes down tomorrow to fill the gap up today, but my bet is TSM actually recovers today’s losses tomorrow. I still see Qualcomm at $139-140 prior to ER, although it’s still a bad stock"

MRVL could be a great acquisition for QCOM at its current market value.
I own some QCOM options and I can tell the trend is up slowly since my $$$ has just started going up not big big amount but it is indicating the good sign - FYI
"Qualcomm has now officially become a buy on the dip stock,For the last few years, it was more like sell on a rally stock,Huge difference !"

"17 analysts - the average of all 17 (after the NXPI increase) is for the pps to hit $71.50 12 months from now. So, you can get $79 in two weeks or $71.50 in 12 months. Seems like a no brainer. The most optimistic analyst only sees $86 in 12 months. Take the $79 now and make 10% on that money and you can match the most optimistic outlook for QCOM without AVGO. The AVGO acquisition is the best option."
$QCOM earnings tmw. Last time QCOM CEO made a comment that lifted $GSAT to $2.
"If you read the news, they want these chips in everything, and they ran out. Hopefully they will find a way to increase production."
"The tug northward is inevitable. Too much value here, too many patents, too much exposure to an enormous, secular growth story, both in 5G and continued digitization of the planet. Long and Strong Qualcomm. Expected prices in the 150s by Summer and probably 200-somethings by early next year. Inflation scares will only hurt the shortterm - in the longterm, inflation is GOOD for what is now essentially a commodity - chips."
Your the best joe keep up the good work
"Can't wait for earnings. So many shorts will get burned, we are going to have a BBQ party for them."

Qualcomm is that stock that won't get out of it's trading range. Kinda like Compaq back in the early 2000s
what can we expect for a best case scenario market cap in the next 2 years for $QCOM?
Doubt if you'll see 168 again.
"Folks lets use the analogy of Baseball to compare QCOM to where it is and where it is going. Right now QCOM is in the bottom of the first inning in this ball game! During Spring training our CEO and coach had to take care of a crooked umpire call Lucy Koh, and a TV broad caster Tim Cook that would not pay the viewership royalties that QCOM (our Ball team) deserved, well he took care of both of these issues. So while in Spring Training the team came up with the Snapdragon 5G Modem Chips, turns out it is the “Gold Standard’ of Modem Chips or the best Pitching in baseball. And after we win this game in 9 innings we are going to the World Series and sweep it in 4 games straight!!! So, how do you like them apples, pun intended? Thumbs up if you agree!!"
"Looks like 149s come and gone. Good chance this goes above 155 T-morrow, and 160s within a week or perhaps two following slew of upgrades. Long term trend is very strong, especially once they remove supply constraint."
"It's highly likely Huawei will end up buying QCOM modem chips; recent license settlement and payout all point to this. QCOM will get a waver on selling to H. To do otherwise would only hurt US interests. The best outcome is allow H. to make hardware but with US chip content, and block H. from own chip development. That will be a win -win."
"Tell you guys a little story. A few weeks ago in our ""amateur investor group"" I said I am thinking of going very heavy in QCOM. Everyone said how come? Well, I said why would NVDA be THAT high and this stock lack behind it so much with a third of the PE? it makes no sense, especially the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G and beyond. The more I think about it, the more I am convinced this stock could double in a year."
I don't want to sell to AVGO at any price.After the merger with NXPI this company will be unbeatable
beat by 6 cents and revenue beat by 0.2billion
"They're working very hard to steal shares, there ought to be a LAW :-)There's only 11 trading days between now and the day of the CC, all indicators are pointing north and I'm sleeping well at night, I added significantly during Covid downturn, and at multiple points on the way back up. If I wasn't selling at the low in March at $60.91, I'm sure as Hell not selling at $130.00+ because of some head fake.Buckle up folks, the next two weeks could be very interesting. GLTA"
"It's just never ending. I give the co. credit for fighting the litigation off over all these years, and with a fair amount of success. But don't you wonder why at some point, the co. doesn't pursue some kind of end all of this? Like splitting the company? Trying to form a coalition to establish fair pricing once and for all, with licensees, industry standards groups, legal minds, etc. I suppose I'm being a little naive with the second one, but it doesn't really matter what the idea is, just something, anything. It would seem that such an initiative would unlock shareholder value since the constant legal overhang produces a discount and it's got to be a drain on innovation to some degree, what with executives being called to testify, produce docs, answer q/s etc etc. That impedes value creation too. Come on Steve, it's time."
"I went on QCOM page to see what time the annual meeting is (9:30PST) and noticed that they have Q2 ER date posted for April 28th. Just fyi - I don't really expect much from annual meeting, they are normally non-events and used just to vote in proxy. I still say that we need to go up on a red Naz day or break 150 to know this ""correction"" is over. Some good signs yesterday for the NASDAQ - but we need a QCOM event (news, ER, buyback, etc.) to shake this loose and back to 160s/170s."
100* quarterly eps of 1.90 = fair price at this time. (*4 = annual run rate of $7.6 at pe of 25). That's the way things worked in the 80s when rates were much higher). Discounted cash flow has everybody twisted into knots and nots.
is it true that all USA iphone 12 models support mmwave?
"QCOM announced a fee months ago that it would walk away from the NXPI deal, if it was not completed by July 21.Well, folks, we are just 19 days away from QCOM having to pay a multi billion $ breakup fee to NXPI."

Well my AMD was on fire yesterday and now my QCOM is smoking!! I have 2 more chip companies to go!!I'm hitting the Jack Daniels tonight!
"The recent announcements in Barcelona were only the latest examples of the company’s growing prominence. Back at CES in January, Qualcomm announced new deals with Chinese carmaker BYD, Honda, and Jaguar Land Rover to provide its next-generation infotainment components, the latter of which generated particular interest because Qualcomm will actually integrate multiple modems into its JLR products."
My vote is to complete acquisition of NXPI and go it alone as an independent company with a huge future.
"Q have the technology and the IP. However you want to negotiate/renegotiate contracts, they will come on the top. just a matter of disruption for short period of time. Everyone wants Q chips and technology, if there is better alternative Apple and like would not sue Q to start with, they go and get the better ones if exist !!!!"
Great buying opportunity on recent pullback. Huge call volume yesterday. Buy!
"it is totally nuts to see companies like Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc go up so much and this great company with so much future potential languish like this. The patience of any investor in this company I believe will be rewarded, however. It is almost unthinkable this company will not be over 200 in 3 years' time with 5G dominating so much of the tech world and you get a nice dividend while waiting."
"Interesting timing of these downgrades. If they wanted to get best value for their clients by selling they would wait until after the stock pops from the beat and raise. On the contrary, if they are tying to get their clients into the stock, today is an example of how that happens."
"Every time we hear apple buying intel modem business, or hear the name Koh, or ftc, qcom drops couple percentages. These are all old news, the biggest unknown is whether 9th circuit will grant stay or no,i am long because i think 9th circuit will stay and qcom will make $8+ eps next year when iphone 5g and others with snapdragon 865 come out. also if trump let huawei out of jail, what will Xi do in return? Huawei signs licence agreement with qualcomm."
Just this evening : FTC Gets Qualcomm Expert Nixed Before Antitrust Trial.It seems to me the FTC vs Qualcomm’s Judge has a mandate from the previous administration to rule against Q in order to benefit Apple later on their own trial. This FTC lawsuit filed on 1/17/2017 just 3 days before inauguration despite the objection of one out the 3 FTC commissioners. I do not think even a settlement would be permitted nor even a government Shutdown would delay the trial. I think Apple knows that. I’m surprised that Qualcomm have not realized that and pursed a settlement yet?Thanks to the Chinese court for enforcing IP rights the US have been lecturing them on. They will try to delay China’s court injunction against Apple till after 1/4/2019 trial.
"Reg. the San Diego Court Case : On patent 949 Q says, that manufacturers save 1.50 USD per device because you need one flash memory less. Apple says, they believe they have been part of the invention. On patent 490, Q says it saves > 1% energy per device, creates less heat for a device which results in less wear and tear. Apple says, they have not metered it. The level of competence, that Apple shows so far, is frightening. One could say, they need to hire engineers to get their basic act together. Whilst Huawei is cooperating with Leica, even Nokia with Zeiss, Apple tries to hire engineers. It becomes more and more clear, whilst others are making better products, Apple’s focus is supply chain, and everybody knows why. To be the best in everything was a believe of command economy, we know how it ended. Will Apples shareholder wake up ? Whom they want to impress by hiring a thousand engineers? Huawei?? It’s project Titan 2.0..."

"I sold all my QCOM last Oct 28 @ $83. QCOM is tops on my buy list to buy back but I'm waiting until earnings reports & forward guidance starting Apr 14. I figure I will take my cue when I see how market responds to initial reports by JPM, C & BAC on the 14th & 15th before I start deploying cash. Figure DOW will easily drop to 10,000-12,500 and that QCOM will be under 40 before the recovery starts. I'm looking to open a new position in QCOM under 40 and add more if it reaches 35 aand even more at 30. I believe the drop still has a long way to go. Market was severely overvalued to begin with and this virus disaster will create a depression before market starts back up and it will take years to recover."
man this is really awesome it's still green even in bad market ..I love Qualcomm stock
Im just getting so sick of seeing red. Should have been the end of it after we got a correction in February. Hearing every excuse about why the sell off continues to be justified. It's manipulation and subjective mindset that tech just has to self off is why this keeps going down.
supply shortage I guess prevents hitting earnings estimate. but Oman said qcom could get the chips they need.
Long awaited biggest short squeeze is started. I'm pretty confident that accumulated volume on short will lift the price far beyond 120$ 20 years of bullish trendline still active and the second biggest breakout is about to burst.

"Good job, longs. I remembered 2-3 years ago, people were calling rhis thing dead money. I considered it as dividend money. Best of luck to all. 1 day we might see 300."
Time to move into $100’s
"Don't worry guys, these earnings give QCOM the go ahead to start going past 100 in the next few weeks..."
"QCOMs gonna be fine here, because unlike some of these stocks caught up in a mania, it’s supported by increasing fundamentals that don’t rely on the health outlook either way. We will earn $6.5 to $7.5 next year which makes this stock still relatively cheap."
Give me another down day and I will buy more
Just broke out to a 3.5 year high today.
after I watched the interview I am more determined that the avago buyout is a disaster fir QCOM shareholders plus the humanity in general. this deal is a Ponzi scheme for Hoc Tan and silver lake....
Qualcomm is the only provider of 5g chips in the western world after Intel dropped it!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfZxsGcWB4
"Hey Tesla, quit your whining or be willing to open up all your technology and offer it for free so it can be copied."
I am very confident this stock will double due to dominance in 5G modem chips. I had meeting with one of its licensees and felt Qcom's greatness
"This sounds more ominous than it seems the market is treating it. Thoughts? 07:59 AM EST, 12/27/2018 (MT Newswires) -- Qualcomm (QCOM) and the US Federal Trade Commission will present arguments on Jan. 4 in a 10-day jury trial over claims that the chip maker is leveraging its strength in the market for smartphone components to force technology companies to pay inflated license fees, Bloomberg News reported.US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, CA., refused to postpone proceedings amid settlement talks and narrowed the scope of the semiconductor manufacturer's arguments in pre-trial rulings.A loss for Qualcomm in court would threaten billions of dollars the company makes in licensing fees, which have been used in research and development. Any blow to the company's ability to further its chip business compromises its future competitiveness as well as its current profits, Bloomberg News said."
Holding up better than I expected given the market is down 340 points. Think a lot of people agree this ruling was far fetched and should be overturned. People who were scared sold yesterday. Expect trump and DOJ to step in shortly and at least temporarily guide this verdict to the sidelines as we battle for 5G dominance.
"TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the firm's latest survey work indicates that the demand outlooks for Q4 and 2021 for Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac are better than expected. In that context, he thinks the shares of the main suppliers of those Apple products are ""worthy of investors' attention,"" Kuo said in a note to investors published yesterday. Some Apple suppliers include Qorvo (QRVO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qualcomm (QCOM), Skyworks (SWKS,) and Synaptics (SYNA) and Broadcom (AVGO), though none of those were mentioned specifically by Kuo in his note."
A substantial increase in the dividend would go a long way in raising share value.
"Funny how Jim Cramer likes to tell everyone they missed the boat on QCOM. Where were you when it was at $58? He asks. Then he says I can”t recommend it at $145, Do not buy this stock he says.. The reason why they didn’t buy at $58 was that Jim was always bashing the company not really understanding what they were all about. Then.at $145 Cramer says that Apple is the real 5G powerhouse not QCOM. Really? If the cat isn’t” out of the bag by now for him it never will be. He clearly either has no idea what he is talking about or is trying to keep a lid on the price to help his cronies accumulate. Who has enabled smartphones and all the apps that have created many multi billion dollar companies and made our lives so much better? Who is about to do the same in numerous other industries. Stay tuned Jim."
Market makers playing options expiration games.
"At this price, should I still buy in?"
"QCOM shareholders ""think"" everybody needs Chips including AAPL ok then buy QCOM $500 cash"
"obviously the China market is a roller coaster at the moment, but what about the rest of the world? Europe, middle east, Australia, n.america , s. America, etc. 5 G will be everywhere. I look at the China market as a huge potential but if it never fully takes hold isn't the revenue from the rest of the GLOBE enough to propel the stock to tremendous growth??"
"Q deserves class action from shareholders because they unfairly avoided shareholder vote, they were sure losing vote and their positions. Now Q management has jobs and money but by their desertion and unfair practices share holders lost a lot."
This company needs new management. Two failed buyouts.
why build when you can get it for cheaper. it seems like Aaple bought the technology from INTEL to suppress anyone else from competing against QCOM as they have signed a long term deal and would be ahead of Samsung and other phone makers.
Did anyone actually think the court would ban apple from importing there products. Qualcomm will win a financial settlement of sort. Then hopefully they can kiss and make up. This would be the best thing for both companies.

"INTC, QCOM…Biden to address chip shortages with executive action, WSJ reportsPresident Biden plans to address chip shortages by ordering a broad review of supply chains for critical materials from semiconductors to pharmaceuticals and rare-earth minerals, The Wall Street Journal's Alex Leary reports. ""There isn't kind of a magic bullet to solve the near-term problem,"" a White House official who works on economic issues said in a briefing with reporters before Biden's action. Last week, a group of U.S. chip companies, including Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Micron (MU) and AMD (AMD), sent a letter to Biden to request ""funding for incentives,"" while Apple (AAPL) supplier TSMC (TSM) is undertaking a major expansion as chip demand outstrips supply. Ford (F) recently said that it would cut production of the F-150 pickup truck because of the chip shortage, while General Motors (GM) has extended shutdowns at some North American plants into March. Reference Link"
I worked at AT&T during the time that they developed the wireless technology. Bell labs came out with TDMA this was the method they developed to “stack” calls during transmission. QCOM developed a competing technology called CDMA. The industry adopted QCOM’s method. This is the technology that is compatible with today’s infrastructure.
Just got 28 shares at 2.4k for the first time with $QCOM. Wish us luck folks.
"Qcom president acquires 19,045 shares recently as well as 2 EVPs each acquired 8,159 and 7,549 shares and CTO acquires 10,401. That’s a lot of insiders"
"The only times I have seen such a share price collapse has been on bad news. Otherwise, all of a sudden investors decide to sell without any reason? Makes no sense.QCOM has lost share value since earnings release!!"
There will be no shorts nor put buying even at $85. Remember dividends will still be at 4%. Plus one time payment from Apple will befor buybacks... Too expensive to short this
"New high, crossing 100B market cap. Removed all uncertainty... keep adding next 5 yrs..."
"Q is above 50 days average, still low obviously. Interesting to see Nokia and Ericsson being close to their 52 weeks high ( business not too comparable), but the FTC case is also impacting them, especially component licensing. Based on this comparison, Q should be around 68 USD. As FTC could not make any point apart from component licensing (and the judge made already a preliminary ruling), Q will be around 68 USD even if the Court will decide also finally in favor of component licensing; if so, Q will appeal anyhow..."
EOD closing $132.5 take my profit... Qcom is unstable today
Best 5G power house - imagine Chinese starts to pay royalties to QCOM. It is money 100% profit
120 next month
"Apple is gambling a lot on trying to bring everything in house but they don't have much of a choice. They are a victim of their own success. Their top line is slowing and in order to keep the growth engine going they need to fight a constant battle with margins. By eliminating Intel, possibly Qualcom, and then who knows next, they have to try and cut costs. When you are trying to move the needle on a $2 Trillion monster you have to try and squeeze everything. This is a hedge for Apple. They have a 6 year plus 2 yr option on Qualcomm and will try their own development. If they fail then they will continue along this road but will pay dearly. This is why they settled last year. They are in a corner and Qualcomm holds all of the cards for years to come. Everyone thinks the Apple ecosystem will never be upended. There are plenty of companies - seasoned and emerging, that will provide years of business for Qualcomm. I'd be more worried to be an Apple shareholder. Their upside is very limited and it's going to be a grind."
Intel has been given the ok to sell chips to Huawei ... this could be good news for Qcom since Intel sold there 5G division to Apple ...
May i know how Qualcomm continuous their production due to lack of chipset?
who else got the yummy dip yesterday.. congrats
"With a good job report, trade truce, and lift of Huawei, the QCOM should be rising from this point."
"While we on the verge to transition to 5G it appears the current crisis may cause acceleration to 5G over the near term. Technology and communication are the Achilles from keeping the world vastly separated because of the necessary distancing to avoid contracting the COvid-19 virus. QCOM should and is going to become even a bigger beneficiary of higher margins resulting in a much higher stock price over the long term. My Qualcomm near term target price before the year's end is $100+, which I am baffled why it has not met as of yesterday, although I am now more inclined to comment it not a matter of if but when it does reach my target."
I love the 5G play and the chip shortage aspect. AAPL is too pricey for such a big company but we can buy QCOM at like 22x earnings right now. And like 16x forward earnings. For a company growing 50%!!! I’m trying to think like Buffet and buy when the market price is waaaay less than the intrinsic value.
"Samsung just announced they're new flagship phone the S21, saying they worked with QCOM on the processor. Another flagship win for QCOM."
"My $165 EOY estimate proved too conservative in the light of Q to Huawei license. This is really big and under-appreciated by the financial community, and 5G is likely to come after. Will likely see $165 EOM and $185-200 EOY."
"The market will look past the coronavirus forecast blip, if there is even soft guidance given."
"Folks I noticed one more item of interest Steve Mollenkopf CEO is not leaving until the end of June, based on that, he knows the next 2 quarters are going to be very good. I would hang around for them too!I think I'm reading between the lines correctly! Good luck to all Longs! Ride the Train!"
"Also coming this month, ITC expecting to release their findings. Last June, ITC staff lawyers are not fully taking Apple’s side in the patent dispute. They have recommended that Judge Thomas Pender rule that an iPhone battery-saving feature violated one of three Qualcomm patents, which normally might enable Qualcomm to stop the iPhones from being imported. But they have stopped short of recommending a ban due to national security considerations."
Back to 100.
I’ll consider buying back in at $39 and if there is a major shake up in management and POS board.
"Semi conductor investors take note. There is a supply shortage. Fabs can create supply if given adequate notice by chip designers! Extra fab capacity is expensive and will take time to build. However, idle fab capacity might be the result - not good. The solution is for product manufactures to build inventory by increasing orders and giving fabs sufficient lead time to produce. I think in the next year this will play out leading to a huge burst in chip sales."
I have feeling as soon I sellIt it’s gone go above $90 . So gone hold on to it
If QCOM stock is undervalued at this price why is it still down????
"OK, more flotsam and jetsam from my skull. The current dividend represents about $900M per quarter. With the stock buy back and all other things equal (which they won't be, but that's for another discussion), $900M over, say, 1.1B shares is about $0.82 per share. And if they raise the dividend 10%, well hello $0.90 per share per quarter."
Btw... This increases leverage for approval to sell chips to Huawei.
"So now intellectual property is worth nothing? Why do research at all if it's worth nothing? This affects more than tech, it affects almost every market!"
"DONT FALL FOR SELLOFF. THEY WANT YOUR SHARES>>>Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives notes that Apple's stock has taken a breather since its ""jaw dropping"" performance in the December quarter came and passed for the Street in late January. That said, the analyst views this as a short-term blip in the stock's upward trajectory as his Asia supply chain checks continue to show robust strength in this iPhone 12 supercycle into the rest of 2021. Given the fundamental strength he is seeing for this supercycle, coupled by a further re-rating on the horizon, Ives believes Apple will hit $3T in market cap by year-end. Importantly, with his estimation that 350M of 950M iPhones worldwide are currently in the window of an upgrade opportunity, the analyst thinks this will translate into an unprecedented upgrade cycle for the company. He also believes there is an upward shift of ASPs for iPhones in this cycle as the iPhone Pro continues to be the predominant model sold globally, which bodes well for top-line numbers heading into the March and June quarters. He has an Outperform rating and a price target of $175 on the shares."
"the low ball offer of 82$ by Broadcom is over .....hello 100$. yes its happening. load up. big time big time share buyback and great dividend ....reality is finally setting in...no more bogus lawsuits ,,,,,its over .."
"Even ISS does not think BROADCOM's offer is high enough so they did not recommend to vote all new board members from Broadcom list, but only 4 out of 6 to negotiate higher price."
Gained another dollar today. Don really needs to learn how to invest if he has any money to invest!
The next two years will be the most favorable risk reward environment the company has ever seen.
"apple and qcom are getting hammered. 2 companies that have a lot of cash and make a lot of cash. kind of companies you should invest in. or you can invest in companies that don't make money, don't have cash, don't have any thing except empty promises."
"Elliott will eventually bail if QCOM keep extending the tender offer, and when the 6 - 8 % of the share flood the market who know what will NXPI SP be like, 110? 100?Elliot is gambling here, all in."
I bought that dip
They had some interesting insights about QCOM on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
who bought at the 132 range last week
"A couple observations. First, I really don't understand the reluctance to let this stock fly but the techs in general are out of favor and Hedge funds are playing in some other sand boxes right now. Saying that, I do believe Cristiano Amon and Kapash need to hit the road...put themselves in front of investor events and do some interviews. This may have to be slow slog grass root effort to get QCOM at least near where it should be. I am long term, and feel confident this is a very safe investment that will pay off in the coming years, so not in a big hurry. However, still frustrating!"
"Fundamentals, earnings, 5g evolution, etc etc.....these are all critically important to qcom, but over the very near term, the stock price is all about one thing.......TRADE DEAL. If there is tangible progress reported during this week's talks, we'll break 80 easily. And I say 'tangible' because the market has shifted somewhat to a show-me phase. The market will discern what tangible is, but for sure, it's NOT going to be ""yes, we made progress and expect to continue talks next month."""
NXPI is turning into a disaster now. Over a year and a half and still not approved by regulators. Amount of tendered shares lower at $127.50 as of March 2017 than at $110 as of March $110. QCOM way overpaid at $127.50 when it didn’t need to because CIFIUS was denying the merger the AVGO hostile bid the whole time and QCOM didn’t need NXPI for a poison pill. Now QCOM has made numerous concessions to Europe and China which will hurt to make this a profitable acquisition. This management team at QCOM is garbage. Plain and simple.
Just hold guys (or buy) the court cases are the ONLY thing keeping Qcomm cheap... Everytime news is quiet it starts heading to 75. Buy cheap while u can.
Qualcomm board still lives in the past relying on a business model that was successful in the last decade but is outdated within current economic dynamics. Time to refresh!
"Look at today's volume on the 8/31 90 strikes. I don't get who could be a call seller. Who would sell to open for a penny and who would sell to close at a penny? I could say a buy to open to try to take a flyer, but who are (is) the call seller??? Fellow?"
People are floacking for companies with no revenue or negative EPS like Snow and Palantir. What enables these technology is QCOM'S 5G and 6G technology that transfer data at faster rate.Buy more QCOM when you have chance like this
Here comes the Huawei market share grab….well ahead of schedule. Snapdragon 778 5G on 6nm released. Honor 50 will be first phone released to public in early June.
"Qcom been waiting and studying really carefully and ready to reject the offer ,my opinion brdcom sweeting the offer a little for not rejecting ,watch the volume tomorrow merge is happening this weekend and qcom is up tomorrow that’s why they waited until market close to announce ...... be smart....do ur homework"
How many articles are needed about Apple buying Intel's modems?
"The QCOM has received a reasonable, adequate and generous offer. The value of stock at 80-85 will be a huge benefit to share holders.Why on earth, those officials at QCOM play game with our money and themselves in this way? Are they hiding something illegal and afraid to be revealed if they accept the offer?Please decide logically. QCOM will never reach those offered prices in the next 10 years. Further, QCOM, like any other product is not unique and without competition.Who knows what will happen in next month or next year to stock market, technology and new invention?"
Small rise to 133 tomorrow then slump to 125.
"So Qualcomm replied to the FTC letter to the 9th circuit. Three judges have been nominated for the panel (two judges have been originally appointed by J. Carter, one by B. Obama). So although there was a time until October for FTC and Qualcomm to raise all relevant arguments in favor of against an appeal of a stay, all formalistic necessities are done, the way I look at it. As judges are nominated, a decision reg. a stay could happen soon...."
Will qcom hit 120? Is that possible? Can U give me a time frame?
Now it makes sense. 20k + $45 PUTS options purchased. FTC and trade war will tank the stock. Selling BMO ...
Demand is through the roof
"In the near term Jay Powell can influence this stock a few dollars one way or another. In the best case scenario he cuts rates. In the 2nd best scenario he lives rates alone, but states there could be a cut n the next quarter. However, ultimately there needs to be a trade deal negotiation with China. Regardless of how you feel about Trump he is doing the right thing for America. You have to stand up to China, the European Union, and Mexico as all of these countries have taken advantage of the USA for a long time. Yes, I understand this can hurt your stocks in the short term, but in the long term it will be very beneficial for Qualcomm. I have held this stock for over 3 years because I knew it was under valued. I think Qualcomm could run to the upper 90's to 100 by the end of the year with a trade deal. They own the best 5G technology which is going to be ground breaking as everyone is going to want this new technology in their phone."
short covering might be near end of day. Bloomberg gave a fantastic chance to everyone to buy at dips with rotten old news. qcom is well well prepared with or without Apple.
"If the stock cannot move higher now, I give up and liquidate my positions in qcom"

"Good forward PE, profit margin, cash on hand and concept. Why is it tanking so much? please give me you insight. Thx in adv."
"Just voted ""NO"" to all Broadcom on the proxy vote. Cannot stand what Broadcom to team up with Apple to steal QCOM and destroy this great innovated company. Apple only care of its profits margin and Broadcom only offer 28% after Apple gave bad news and took down the price. What a joke of $70/share. No to all for Broadcom for that price which they tried hard to replace board members so they can gain control of the board to approve the deal."
"I e had Qcom since 1999. ive seen it pop to about 80 then retreat. its been in the 20s and ive never sold because I beleieved in the technology. unfortunately a great company and a great stock is no guarantee. these week I feel vindicated. I truly believe the stock price, without all the legal issurs over the years, should be mid 300s paying a solid 3% div. i always thought problem was the outstanding shares were huge. that its hard to move up with all those shares. thats nonsense. when the big boys say its going up it moves real high. same for when it goes down big. bottom line is if you need the cash do what you need to do and if you can ride this another 10-15 years you maybe able to retire off of it. this company has always had eyes on its every move from smaller and large companies for the technology and talent. it's hard to stay on top of the mountain....but Qcom despite all obstacles has finally spike its flag!"
"Don't understand, this shld be up at least 15$$ in AH. look at FB up double double"
Large. Large volume at the end. Wowww
"In regards to NXPI, they obviously way overpaid at $127.50 thinking they needed it to fend off AVGO. Now they are faced with China blocking and losing $2 billion and further infuriating the shareholders further. Why risk it? They need to terminate and move on. The tender is a year and a half older and they still are not closer than when they started."
Got a upgrade from Cascend...price target changed to $145 from $125.

"This stock was just looking for a reason to sell-off. This was mostly profit taking in my opinion. This stock has more than doubled since the lows reached in April, so a minor correction was inevitable. NVidia has regularly experienced similar sell-offs on its way up to $500/share. Apple should worry more about developing innovative products beyond their current hardware lineup vs trying to develop their own modem chips to reduce their costs for phones with already the largest gross margins in the industry."
"What are the predictions for tomorrow if tonight AVGO puts our a PR that they met with CFIUS today, listened to their concerns, are structuring the transaction to alleviate their concerns, and will continue to work closely with CFIUS to ensure national security concerns are addressed."
I don't own QCOM but congrats on sticking it to Apple
"Apples lawsuits against QCOM only indicates to me that they feel that QCOM has become too powerful and will eventually control eveything in its current and future spaces. They cannot tolerate a company that can dominate them. If the trend is allowed to continue it would relegate Apple and for that matter AVGO and others to a less significant position.When QCOM completes the acquisition of NXPI it will be unstoppable.Even though I also own shares in AAPL,CSCO MSFTand INTC I think QCOM will prove to be the best investment of all."
"No hate, I own shares. If the company thinks they have a great future/service/product, why aren't they started a buy back process?"
"""""We're fully prepared to use our powers to protect national security,"" Mnuchin said, according to CNBC TV""""For now, the Cfius review and Mnuchin's comments appear to make it less likely that Broadcom would get the votes it needs to secure control of Qualcomm's board, or even obtain a minority-slate of directors.""""https://www.thestreet.com/story/14517497/1/sceptics-put-broadcom-s-5-g-pledge-in-focus.html?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo"
"Trump's Stimulus Plan to Rev Up 5G AdoptionAniruddha GangulyZacksJune 17, 2020, 7:04 AM EDTThe year 2020 is touted as one which will witness network experience transformation through widespread implementation of 5G. The fifth-generation network, which boasts faster download speeds thereby facilitating seamless transfer of data, has gained immense significance amid the coronavirus outbreak that has pushed the economy online. Rapid proliferation of remote working, learning and health diagnosis amid lockdowns and shelter-in-place guidelines to curb the spread of the virus is exerting considerable stress on existing 4G networks. In order to address the rising traffic, online video content providers like Netflix had to compromise on streaming quality, much to the frustration of consumers. Moreover, growing demand for e-commerce, contactless delivery through drones and digital payment highlight the urgency for 5G network development. Hence, it’s not surprising that the Trump administration’s latest $1-trillion stimulus plan has reportedly earmarked a fund for developing 5G infrastructure. The draft proposal shows the latest effort by the U.S. government to revive the coronavirus-ravaged economy. Notably, all three major U.S. indices – the Dow Jones industrial, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – rallied following reports on Trump’s infrastructure stimulus plan. 5G Prospects Aplenty 5G is expected to attract extensive infrastructure spending from major economies. Notably, China and South Korea are already spearheading in terms of spending, while United States is expected to catch up this year. As such, 5G infrastructure market is estimated to grow from $12.6 billion in 2020 to $44.9 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 28.97%, per a Research and Markets report. The solid growth in infrastructure spending bodes well for other 5G-related markets including chipset, equipment, network and edge computing. It is also expected to help in driving user base for 5G smartphone and apps. Additionally, 5G is likely to boost proliferation of smart connected homes, devices, hospitals, factories and cities along with self-driving vehicles. Moreover, it is expected to facilitate rapid adoption of emerging applications like AR, VR and AI. Further, 5G enables advanced technologies in the IoT space, for instance, extending sensor driven IoT capabilities to drones, actuators and robots."
people selling to get in coin?
"ultimately 5G is what caused QCOM to win, they were able to stretch this out long enough to prove that Apple needed QCOM moe than QCOM needed Apple. It didn;t hurt QCOM that Apple sales also tanked during the very long run up to the trial. many regard Apple as the best phone supplier, if the ""best supplier"" chose QCOM for 5G for the very reason to lift their sales by giving them a superior product then other suppliers will jump onot the same bandwagon so as not to be left behind, QCOM is back"
"Resistance in the 66.59-66.72 range, then the 52-week high at 69.28."

"I don’t believe that a CIFIUS 2.0 is necessary, as the author does (the respective judges in context with FTC and ITC can’t ignore last weeks decision of an independent jury being 100% in line with Qualcomm’s evaluation), but it shows cause and consequences in a much better way than a lot of copy / paste stuff. https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190318/analyst-angle/why-ftc-vs-qualcomm-ruling-is-not-just-about-a-company-but-about-the-country-analyst-angle"

"I'm a QCOM Long, and plan to stay that way. I agree with several of the good post replies below concerning the reprinted news about Apple making its own modem chips. QCOM will still be the strong leader, and Apple and others will always be in the rear view mirror. Temporary price drop is a good time to buy more shares. :)"
I am buying like crazy in the $127's....18-months from now we'll be at $254 and I'll be sitting on a 100% gain.
"Sounds like potential movement on the FTC case, and at QCOM's expense. But just to what extent I certainly can't say. Sounds like the next court date is October 18th.http://www.fosspatents.com/2018/09/federal-trade-commission-may-open-up.html?m=1"
QCOM is sky-rocketing out of the stratosphere now. The more money U invest now - the richer u'll become. It's that simple. QCOM has unlimited potential.

"stock:""I think you stick with this stock. I do understand that it's up something like 33% in two days, but fair value to me on this stock is $96 a share. With Apple revenues and earnings now back in the picture — they've been out for two years — you're looking at earnings around $6 [per share], probably north of that. But use $6, put a 16 [times price-to-earnings] multiple on that, [and] you get to $96. If you want to know, why 16 times? Look: if this were just a chip manufacturer, you'd say 10 to 12 times. But what happened yesterday validated ... the high-margin [intellectual property] model that Qualcomm has depended on for 25 years."

"The DOJ filing actually worries me a bit, this signals that the behind the scene pressure from DOJ/DOE/DOD and WH to FTC and Koh did not work out so far. Most likely due to partisan politics. This seems like a formal warning from FTC to the court that the U.S have interest in this case, and for both FTC and Judge koh to proceed with caution and most importantly avoid harming U.S national interest/security. Now she has been put on notice, if she knowingly disregard the request for remedy hearing and proceeds to damage U.S national security and interest to the benefit of China and Huawei. Then DOJ may have enough to investigate her and the involved FTC commissioners/legal team on the basis of national security. Seems like nowadays, no one is safe from some investigations if politics deems it necessary, Trump is not safe, neither is Koh."

Apple just beat... meaning QCOMs party continue tomorrow!
"If QCOM is so important to national security, then why is the stock so low? How come Micron or Intel is not interested in buying QCOM? How come Apple will not pay their licensing fees to QCOM? Almost sounds like Trump and the Government are being paid by someone to quash QCOM stock."
QCOM up $5 in after hours WOW  Did they have earnings? I remember last earnings it dropped from almost $170 to $120
Ignore all the political hype. 5G rollout is doing just fine in America. As everyone's hair is on fire over the headlines the rollout continues unabated. You will wake up one day soon and realize all is well and getting better. Don't let the naysayers steel your shares on the cheap.
"They did an excellent job at the balance sheet: strong cash, much less inventory, much much less short and long term debt. Build up of equity. This in front of a strong year 2020. Congrats !! This will be good !!"

@Fellow We need conclusions. Is QCOM price expected to jump to above $70 by August 31?
They had some interesting insights about QCOM on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"One-time freak weather event in one state creating panic and opportunity; ""Samsung’s own production got sideswiped last month. Its fab in Austin, Texas -- which makes chips both for internal and external consumption -- was sidelined in February by statewide power outages and hasn’t resumed full production. The resulting shortfall in production of Qualcomm 5G radio frequency chips could reduce global smartphone output by 5% in the second quarter, research firm Trendforce estimates."""
"Qualcomm (QCOM) is positioned close to the eye of the macro storm. A heavy reliance on China and uncertainty concerning near-term smartphone supply and demand dynamics have contributed to a difficult 2020 for QCOM, with shares down 12% year-to-date. However, despite renewed tensions between the U.S. and China, Qualcomm could actually benefit from the worrying developments, so says Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley. The recent Department of Commerce ban on Huawei, preventing it from purchasing semiconductors from U.S. companies, has ignited fears of retaliatory moves against companies such as Apple and Qualcomm. That being said, Qualcomm’s management noted Huawei is not a significant customer. In fact, Walkley argues the move could be good for the chipmaker. “We view any Huawei smartphone share losses, which are likely with it not gaining access to Android software, as a benefit to Qualcomm as its leading QCT customers such as OPPO and Vivo are likely to gain market share from Huawei,” said the 5-star analyst."
"Intel and Skyworks will come up with figures later, then we see where we are to a certain extend...Texas Instruments yesterday not too good to my disappointment."
65 by feb 15th. mark my words..
5G will be huge investment in the US. None of the big carriers wants to be left behind. Does not matter the cost. Which one will be first to say “the only 5g network in the US”. Most customers will switch for any implied faster service. What a promo this will be and what pain it will cost any carrier that is not on board. Qcom is position to take the lead and possibly finally be that lead everyone was hoping for. When that happens this stock will be a $150 stock in 12 -18 months. Strong buy!
"So, why is China the last to approve of the QCOM NXP merger? When will China come around and approve this - or not?"
Bad market reading. good moment to buy (I DO)

Falling interest rates are keeping Q from falling faster because of the generous dividend. An increase in the dividend will also stem the decline.

Qualcomm Snapdragon chip is a game changer. In a year's time you will look back at when it was this price and kick yourself
Check out Berstein's analyst Stacey Reasgon's conversation Q&A with Qualcomm's Christiano. Stacey has been a huge skeptic for years but is starting to see the potential. In my opinion it was that conversation that drove the price action today not the 4G licensce to Huawei.
4% increase while volume is lower than 3M average. Bullish!
"QCOM just broke support at $62. Next support is Tuesday's low of $61.06. Light volume, but not a positive sign on a flat to up-ish market day. Under $62, the market is no longer pricing in a slight AVGO advantage. Between 60 and 62 it is completely a 50-50 proposition."
"If I bought $QCOM stocks today, am I still eligible for the upcoming dividend?"
"Jice, there is no doubt this is going to fill the $136.57 gap from Wednesday close. The S&P will correct over the next month. Not surprised as it’s been topping here. Nothing left to drive the market higher. Qualcomm is a gift at $136xx at this juncture"

There are overwhelming demand vs supply, clearly its growing pain that every growing businesses go through. Qcom is selling everything they have...i am sure every business wishes they have this kind of problem... Market’s reaction to 9% percent drop is just over reaction which will correct itself...if you are long term holder like myself just relax and have a drink, i know i am doing just that. If you are short term holder i would hold on until 2 weeks later when qcom recovers, if you are short, you may want to cover."

"NVDA is too expense. QCOM is too good a value. Both declined about 25% off the Dec-2020 reports. NVDA has run way up, in part due to Mr Cramer's support. Of course he is endorsed by an influential institutional broker. If I was holding NVDA with good profits, I would sell and buy QCOM. QCOM is better positioned in it's markets and is a much better value. Qualcomm has not turned on a dime after the last report. It takes time to turn the ownership around, The average daily volume is 10 million and there are 1100 million shares outstanding. The earnings beat was only two days ago, and the entire sector has been very weak last few days."
"QCOM management is primarily responsible for delivering investment returns to the owners of the company. They have failed to do so for many years while their competitors have. The arguments that QCOM is a national treasure or that it is critical technology that must be owned/controlled by a U.S. based company is lunacy. Why should long suffering QCOM shareholders be required to support this R&D center? If not for the AVGO attempt to acquire QCOM the stock would be trading in the 50's.Vote blue.Even with 6 BOD seats a fair and better price can be negotiated. If AVGO tries to ""steal"" QCOM given their majority BOD position after the March 6th Blue vote QCOM shareholders can reject the deal."

"Samsung has nothing on qcom, they are barely going to pump monies in R&D, lol.. a little too late don't you think?. They lacked the vision before, now they want to enter not just qcom, but amd, nvidia, and intel space.

It will NOT be easy for samsung yo break into this sector, they will be the late comers, and when qcom is maybe a decade ahead in design, they'll barely be catching up, perhaps reverse engineering their competitors, while their competitors are leaving them in the dust with newer and better designs. I don't see how samsung can really cause any real hit in the market. QCOM is already a better chipmaker, bar none. And they don't distract themselves with trying to make dishwashers or refrigerators either. Samsung means zero at this point, they are barely doing their r&d, lol...god knows where the mobile chil market will take us, when they can fibally come up with a final product, maybe in three years? with all hands on deck and even then, qcom will be 3 years ahead.

"I have said this before and will say again. Qualcomm will be backed by the US govt in whatever it wants to achieve in the next 5 years. Americs is way behind China in 5G. So much so that when it asks Europe to avoid Huawei, it doesn't have a technology of its own to present to them as replacement.Trump only last week announced emphasis on 5G and its no coincidence that this settlement happens. The FTC ruling should come in Qualcomm favor at any time now. Do you people really think that regulators in America will play right into Huawei hands by punishing Qualcomm? Impossible. In fact, just like Huawei is a darling of the Chinese govt, Qualcomm will become the darling of the US govt. And that will mean $$$"
Lots of upside for Q - Apple's iphone12 is selling through the roof; FTC defeated and gone; 5G is coming like a tsunami; new infrastructure and automotive growth drivers. On top there is high likelihood Huawei will be allowed to get Q modems chips no matter who wins the elections. Better let them buy Q chips than make it themselves.

INTC stops 5G chip due to QCOM deal with AAPL... QCOM $120+ imo.
Which company is better positioned? Qcom or Nokia? Both say they have large amounts of patents re 5G??
Notice that Elliott is now saying that his 6% of NXPI is worth $135 per share. I'd like to ask him why stop at $135 - why not claim $200 per share?
Never had any doubts :)
Do you believe it's likely that AVGO will make a higher priced offer?
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/445777-qualcomm-ruling-a-case-of-antitrust-gone-wrong
Kim Bolton and Gordon Reid support buying QCOM at these levels. Good sign!
It is so unfortunate on how the media can bring in old news with nothing new can wipe out some bill of dollars in marketcap.. QCOM's run has just started and it will reach 200 soon...just watch it in next few ERs
Notice that qocm has been trading sideways from the spring of 2012 on at least even as the general stock markets have more than doubled in value.
"Here is quote from The FTC commissioner Wilson: “As one of the five commissioners who have since taken the helm of that agency, you might presume I am pleased with this decision. I am impressed by the persuasiveness of our legal team, which dutifully litigated the case my predecessors handed it. But I am dismayed that the judge took this opportunity to create new legal obligations, undermine intellectual-property rights, and expand the application of our antitrust laws beyond U.S. borders.Qualcomm has announced that it will appeal the decision. Speaking for myself, and not for the FTC or any other commissioner, I encourage higher courts to reconsider the wisdom of the judgeʼs conclusions. In the interim, I write to make clear to businesses, fellow antitrust enforcers abroad, and law students my opinion that this ruling is both bad law and bad policy.”She concludes:“Thankfully, serious damage can yet be avoided. Qualcommʼs appeal will allow the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and potentially the Supreme Court, to assess the wisdom of these sweeping changes. In the meantime, Qualcomm has an excellent case for staying the judgeʼs ruling, thereby ensuring that Silicon Valleyʼs latest innovation does not become an immediate boon to foreign firms that use American technology to sell foreign phones to foreign consumers.”"
Will likely close up .56 cents tomorrow. 
"From a short term perspective I had mentioned that this would easily close the $136.57 gap from last Wednesday’s close after I saw the stock perform badly on Friday, people didn’t want to hear it so I got a bunch of thumbs down. I still fully believe this rockets higher in the next two quarters to come. I expect, not hope, $180-185 by October earnings"
"What would be very helpful to know:1) How long does Koh have to accept/reject the stay request of her ruling?2) If she does NOT grant the stay, how long will it take for qcom to receive an appeal ruling from the 9th district?3) Assuming the above, is qcom required to commence changing licensing deals prior to the 9th's ruling?4) If she DOES grant the stay, how long will it take qcom to appeal Koh's ruling to the 9th?Where are all the lawyers when ya need 'em!"
"With an amazing quarter, Apple still almost turn into red. If Qcom turn into red as well, I will take all my profit and leave this manipulated market. It is cruel and unfair to longs."

"Apple modem report sinking Qualcomm doesn't offer new info, says Raymond James - maintains strong buyAfter Bloomberg reported last night on Apple's (AAPL) internal modem development, causing pressure on Qualcomm (QCOM) shares this morning, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said he doesn't think the article ""offers new information"" given that ""Apple was very clear to us when they acquired the Intel team that they did so with the intention of building their own modem."" Investors know about Apple's intent to eventually replace Qualcomm, which is the principal part of the bear case on the stock, but the question remains ""if and when"" Apple's initiative will be successful, said Caso. The analyst, who added that ""the threat of Apple's modem development is no doubt a risk - but it's not a new risk,"" keeps a Strong Buy rating on Qualcomm shares, which are down over 8% to $142.69 in afternoon trading."
is this a $200 stock or a $130 one?
"2020 Annual nonGAAP was $4.19. FYE Sep-2021 is $7.06 and for 2022 at $7.8 MEAN estimates. HIGH estimates are $8.2/share 2021 and $10.0 for 2022, according to Reuters summary of all analysts. This seems low to me, given the $2.08 est for Q1 2022 vs only $0.98 for the yoy quarter. QCOM peak earnings will be which year? Seems this should be a 10 year run with earnings compounding at 20%. Maybe I'm getting things mixed up since the FY ends Sept. I'll check Simply Wall Street."
"Qcom will eventually do what NVDA stock has done because of its own quality, not because of Apple or anyone else. It is a good company that's under valued right now. In the long run the games don't matter. We will see 80's by the end of the year."
"Qualcomm / National Security:One more time Im rather speechless: Apple is lobbying since 2011 (!) to pay not on device level, but on component (=modem) level. To be precise, Apple wanted to pay 5 % of the modem price of around 30 USD making it 1.50 USD per unit. With this lobbying activity, it’s more than understandable that there is only one US company left. In case Apple would be successful, there would be no US modem supplier anymore. R&D around the components is ver expensive, the main reason Intel dropped out and sold business. Apart from that, Samsung and Huawei but also Mediatec have been able, to use their own (inferior) components. Apple did virtually everything to scare possible inventors and hopefully, the FTC case is over soon to ensure proper enumeration for inventors again. Q is used to competition, but the Apple / FTC initiative was the real thread to Q and to innovation in general. If licensing on component level becomes the norm, innovations will be possible for Apple, Samsung and Huawei...this was always the target of these companies (and the FTC supported this initiative). What a joke, when I read WSJ !!!"
how can you tell when the buybacks start? just track the daily volume or is there a better method?
"I'm very long qcom calls, so it's an effort to be completely unbiased in looking at the aapl / qcom battle. But if I try really hard, I just can't see a way that this ends well for apple. For qcom, I honestly don't see how a new trial could render their frand pricing excessive with the valuation just recently ascribed by the court to three patents. But for apple, I mean another bruising trial, no 5g modem, potential to wind up even worse off than they are w/ qcom (qcom can pursue non-preferential pricing), the continued patent infringement overhang, etc etc. How could they win? I suppose it would be for a new judge to somehow rule that flies right in the face of the previously established value of the three patents? Am I missing anything?"

"""The idea that Apple might not have a 5G iPhone until at least 2021 might sound like a major problem for the tech giant, but it's not likely to have much of an impact on the company. As Arcuri and Shah point out, roughly 20% of iPhone owners are holding on to devices older than the iPhone 6. And at some point, those people are going to have to upgrade.""We expect some growth in the out years as customers upgrade their phones to be able to use the latest services as well as new form factor (a foldable phone) driving a consumer driven upgrade cycle,"" Arcuri and Shah wrote.Of course, there's also the fact that 5G networks won't be nearly as built out as current 4G LTE networks are for quite some time. In other words, customers who jump on the 5G bandwagon early are going to be left spending much of their time on 4G LTE networks.We've seen this before during the transition from 3G to 4G LTE. Customers who bought 4G LTE smartphones were regularly shuffled between the high-speed connection and the slower 3G network.""Sorry, kiddees...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-5g-iphone-221125077.html"
"1 billion dollars is absolutely nothing, which leads me to believe Apple wasted money on a failed Intel 5G unit. Intel would not have bailed on 5G if their technology was top notch."
"Hmm didn’t Sesq analyst say mmWave adoption was “slowing”. Found this from Jan article...Today, a supply chain report out of Taiwan reveals that a company called Qiqi is in the process of receiving a large order for millimeter wave antennas for the iPhone 13 which could be signaling the expansion of this technology to more iPhone models in the US this year. Apple is also working with foreign telecom companies in the hopes of eventually expanding millimeter wave antennas to iPhones globally over the next few years. According to the report, the Wistron Group invested in Netcom factory Qiqi and has now entered the iPhone supply chain for millimeter wave antennas for the first time, sharing with Japanese electronics giant Murata Manufacturing Co. this year. Qiqi is an important layout of Wistron Group in the field of Netcom. Wistron holds approximately 22.6% of shares and is the largest single shareholder. The large order of millimeter wave antennas for the new iPhone 13 series is the first time a Taiwanese manufacturer has supplied Apple's antenna-related items that are critical to the quality of iPhone reception. Qiqi's chairman Xie Hongbo, who was once the CEO of Wistron's NeWeb Corporation, announced at the law conference a few days ago that 5G-related product shipments will increase significantly this year, especially the US market where millimeter wave-related antennas are being used. It is optimistic that the revenue from 5G will account for a larger proportion of this year than in 2020. Two to three times increase, vaguely revealing that a large order is approaching. An authoritative source said that compared to the current global 5G mainstream Sub 6, millimeter wave can also reflect the characteristics of 5G ultra-high speed, low latency, and wide connection. It is known as the ""true 5G,"" which is making Apple actively invest. The millimeter wave iPhone antenna design is more complicated. Qiqi has been working in the millimeter wave field for many years, so Apple has come to cooperate with Qiqi. Qiqi's supply of iPhone antennas is a major breakthrough in Taiwan's Netcom industry. Qiqi has made a breakthrough in the built-in antenna of laptops, with a global market share of as high as 35%, ranking the leader, and it is a big help for Wistron's laptop OEM orders. In the past, Wistron Group focused on assembly in the iPhone supply chain. Previously, it was assigned to Lixun's Kunshan factory in mainland China and actively expanded its non-mainland iPhone production layout. As Qiqi enters the key antenna supply chain for the iPhone, it means that Wistron Group plays a more important role in the overall iPhone supply. As governments and telecommunications companies in various countries successively open up 5G millimeter wave spectrum and build 5G millimeter wave networks, Apple continues to invest in related technology research and development. This year’s iPhone 13 series is expected to improve millimeter waves. According to industry sources, Apple was actively looking for a second millimeter wave antenna supplier and Qiqi Queping was selected to win the iPhone 13 millimeter wave antenna order and share the order with Murata. According to corporate analysis, Qiqi has good capabilities in antenna design, packaging, testing, modularization, and antenna modularization of micro devices. In addition, it cooperates closely with Qualcomm, including 5G equipment, 5G vehicles, and Wi-Fi 6, 6E products. The development and design of Qualcomm chips has also become one of the key factors for Qiqi winning the iPhone 13 millimeter wave antenna order. Although its not likely that the MacBook Pro will offer 5G with a millimeter wave this year, Qiqi's expertise with telecom antennas for notebooks could be something that Apple could take advantage of in the future. For now, Qiqi's order from Apple are reportedly focused on iPhone 13 devices."

"Reg. possible timelines for final decision :Not unexpectedly but understandably, Qualcomm just filed a 176-page opening brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in its appeal of the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust victory in the Northern District of California--and an 11-page unopposed motion explaining why the opening brief has to be that long.This has implications for the timeline. The most recent scheduling order, based on another unopposed Qualcomm motion, gave the FTC until October 25 for its responsive brief, and Qualcomm until November 15 for its reply brief. But in that motion Qualcomm already indicated that the FTC could also get an extension (after Qualcomm got two more weeks because the expedited schedule was too expedited even for them) should Qualcomm exceed page limits. It now turns out the FTC will even get twice as much extra time: four weeks. Qualcomm doesn't oppose it, so it's a given that the FTC will use that extra time and then file its responsive brief just before Thanksgiving--and then Qualcomm will have until mid-December for its reply brief.When the Ninth Circuit's motions panel for August granted Qualcomm's motion to stay the enforcement of two of the FTC's antitrust remedies yesterday morning and ordered that the hearing be scheduled for January, this extension was not factored in. As a result, the appellate hearing will presumably slip into February (February 3-7 or February 10-14), if not March 2-6; at the very earliest it might take place January 21-24 (the later one of the Ninth Circuit's two January 2020 court sessions), but the January 6-10 session doesn't appear to be a practical option anymore. There are San Francisco sessions scheduled"

The Greensboro, N.C.-based company will benefit from the ""once-in-a-decade shift"" to next-generation cellular technology. It is exposed to both 5G smartphones and infrastructure, Ackerman said in a note to clients. The shift to 5G remains in its early innings, he says. Qorvo is seeing a 40%-plus content lift in smartphones vs. 4G wireless, Ackerman said. Qorvo provides chips to Apple (AAPL, Samsung and other smartphone vendors.

Should be downgraded to 90 after ER.
"I would be enlightening if the 9th Circuit Court asked the FTC why chipmakers feel they need a license at the modem component level and to ask the OEM’s why they feel Qualcomms royalties at the device level are exorbitant. I would expect we will find that chipmakers don’t have the wireless expertise to effectively compete with Qualcomm. Qcom invested heavily, innovated and fostered the growth of the wireless ecosystem. Companies like Intel and Apple with massive financial resources had the ability to do the same but did not. Qualcomm’s royalties are a small fraction of the revenues they enabled for OEM’s like Apple, Samsung and others. Complaints about no license no chips are smoke and mirrors. Why should OEM’s be entitled to the mobile echo system technology without paying the royalty that qualcomm earned and deserves through its investments and inventions? Pay the license royalty and then you are entitled to use the chips that work only because of all that system (network/handset/basestation) technology. Qualcomm is the kind of legal monopoly that patent laws were intended to incentivize and create for the good of invention. Qualcomm earned it, they deserve it. Thank you Qcom for everything you have enable and will enable."
Price is up today. QCOM must be putting on a strong case.
Sold all my Apple this morning and split the proceeds between QCOM and AVGO. I have such tremendous belief in these two companies and especially QCOM that I am very comfortable in doing so. It is going to be an interesting ride.

"Marc and kingspellchecker, I am not negative on Qualcomm as a company. I actually own Jan 2022 calls $155 strike to be exact. With that said, they were the $175 strikes for Jan 2022 and because of the plummet, I lost 75% of the value in which I had paid $18.67 for those $175 strikes. That’s why I sold those and bought the lower price strike being the $155’s. I do not believe the stock will reach $200 by any means by year end as Marc suggests primarily because that would require for example Qualcomm receiving a one year forward PE at that time of say 23.5x on $8.50 earnings for 2022. It won’t happen as this stock is not allowed to have a forward looking valuation like this. Couple that with the disaster administration we have, higher capital gains by a much larger margin then we have today with higher taxes on individuals and there you have it. Also, the S&P is already up 12% this year. That in and of itself is good for one year alone in gains much less the first four months of the year. And yes, the overall market does matter in this equation because Qualcomm is not a stock that will outperform the market individually unlike Nvidia seems to do every year for the past six years. Nvidia and AMD seems to be the only semi chip stocks worthy of this insane 40x plus forward PE’s. I actually believe because of the bad policies by Biden it will eventually compress PE ratios. Therefore, in Qualcomm’s case, and because of higher corporate tax rates coming, almost forgot about that, I don’t see anything better then a 20x forward PE despite the fact it will likely grow EPS 25-30% this year. At best, $175 to end the year, and I’m just hoping by early second half of the year it gives a headfake to get to $160 so I can dump the $155’s with time premium still there to get out of this. As I said before, I made a big mistake thinking the stock would get re-rated on its forward looking valuation due to coming 5G massive growth, I was way off in my thinking. The market knew better then me and isn’t impressed with Qualcomm and won’t be to give it a higher valuation"
"Things looking massive on Iphone 12 front.... The massive demand for iPhone 12s was reported in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) blowout first quarter, the tech giant's first-ever $100 billion quarter. With the iPhone 12 catapulted to the top of the 5G smartphone market within weeks of its launch, an analyst now says his channel checks show that the so-called ""supercycle"" continues unabated, and not even a chip shortage can slow it down. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told investors in a research note that after checking into Apple channels, he discovered builds for the current quarter continue at a blistering rate -- between 56 million and 62 million -- without any letup in demand. Even the June quarter could see them in the mid 40 million range. He says this is the greatest demand trajectory in years, possibly going as far back as 2014 when the iPhone 6 was released. As a result, Ives is keeping his outperform rating on the stock and a $175 per share price target. Factoring in Friday's closing price at a penny under $120, this would mean Apple has 46% upside still possible.There might be good reason for such bullishness. Samsung Securities analyst MS Hwang told Bloomberg last week the tight supply of semiconductor chips ""is affecting everybody except Apple."""

Qualcomm is going through a management change which itself makes investors nervous. The new CEO is unknown. I expect that he will need to prove himself in the eyes of the market. Also, the series of lawsuits on Qualcomm's key asset might be viewed as a liability by some important investors. These factors are amplified by sector weakness and the need to rotate objective forward looking investors into ownership."

Remember when Yahoo rejected Microsoft's offer and then sold for less.Maybe this deal is more about Golden Parachute offer for the QCOM management and BOD.Who wants to buy a company that has big arguments with their biggest customers and governments.Please investigate the CFIUS and the two republicans who voiced their concern for foreign company buying Qualcomm.Broadcom will be US company by 6/2018 and all their board members are American Citizens.Something smells in Denmark.
"The sleezeball call for CIFIUS review at the last second most likely infuriated the big shareholders who were about to vote them out. Imagine if CIFIUS now steps in and blocks it, and then MOFCOM blocks NXPI. QCOM would be back in the low 50’s and they would owe $2 billion to NXPI. Imagine how those big shareholder will feel then? Massive lawsuits against the directors. Perhaps Jacobs resigning was a push by large shareholders. They have had enough!"
Still waaaaaaay overvalued. Will likely fall below $90 by July. Inevitable.

It fill the gap which is exist from November. 1Day chart obviosluy show us cup & handle formation. Probably it will reach first 165 again and pullback to 150 (creation of handle). Then it will increase as a handle `height` to 200$ almost around the beginning of June.

"Qualcomm interview: China’s early launch proves the world wants 5G now""History will remember April 2019 as a particularly big month for 5G networks, as carriers from the U.S., South Korea, and Europe all launched or significantly expanded their first 5G services. Last night, another global power revealed that it is 5G-ready, as state-owned carrier China Unicom announced that it’s moving up China’s first 5G network deployment to May. The news was unsurprisingly trumpeted by key 5G chipmaker Qualcomm, which has taken a key role in supplying components and support for all of the launches, and will have 5G modems inside most of China Unicom’s first 5G devices.""""To mark this significant global milestone for 5G deployments, I interviewed Qualcomm 5G marketing director Ignacio Contreras and 5G communications lead Samir Khazaka, discussing both the China Unicom announcement and the broader state of 5G across the world today. The message was clear: “all rational players in the industry” are in the process of preparing to deploy 5G very quickly, as there’s widespread carrier and consumer interest in faster, more capable devices and networks — noticeably more excitement than in the 3G to 4G transition.""https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/qualcomm-interview-chinas-early-launch-proves-the-world-wants-5g-now/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+venturebeat%2FSZYF+%28VentureBeat%29"

"Well folks I have to comment on this Analyst statement about QCOM. Citi analysts warned that the upside to Qualcomm stock from the current 5G upgrade cycle is over. They declared that more downside looms, including lower margins.He then followed this statement up with some more insane comments as he declared the World is Flat, and the Sun and all the other planets revolve around the Earth. Also there have been sightings of Aliens in Area 51!!I have to wonder how do you take all the positive information about 5G that is in the first inning of development come up with such a ridicules analysis??

There is obvious taste difference. We pay premium to real butter.5G just started, and every company pay premium to real 5G chips. Mediatek chips are not stable enough"
What is the problem now again??
As I said do not sell before earnings..
QCOM has a new chip for watches which will make APPL's watch mostly a play thing. Coming out this fall.

"all smart phone maker have to buy qcom chips if they want make 5g smart phone, 5g networks is trending, so qcom will continue go up, Apple and intc spent huge money study 5g chips, but they lost money, qcom is very smart ,"
"Holy Cow! Look at this...Chinese budget phone maker Honor said on Friday it had signed partnerships with major chip suppliers such as Intel and Qualcomm after being spun off from parent Huawei Technologies in the wake of U.S. sanctions last year.Huawei had sold Honor to a consortium of 30 of the sub-brand's agents and dealers in November to help it resume sourcing components restricted by the sanctions.As Chief Executive George Zhao launched the View40, Honor's first phone model since the split, Honor said in a statement it now had its own deals with some tech firms.These include AMD, MediaTek, Micron Technology, Microsoft, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Sony.""The last five months have been an extremely difficult but meaningful time for Honor,"" Zhao said. ""We feel the weight of expectation from industry partners and consumers.""Samsung and Hynix declined to comment, while Intel, AMD, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Micron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.One supplier source said Honor becoming a separate entity from Huawei was enough for suppliers to supply components.Under Huawei, Honor focused on the budget end of the phone spectrum, but it will aim to move into the middle and higher tier market and expand overseas, Zhao said.The company said it would pursue the 'internet of things' market, calling its strategy '8+1+N', the same term used by Huawei.""They wanted to show they are Huawei reborn so that customers can trust them to have the same quality Huawei was aiming for,"" said Nicole Peng, VP of Mobility at Canalys, a consultancy.Honor shipped 13.3 million phones in the third quarter of last year, making up just over a quarter of Huawei's total shipments, according to Canalys.Honor's roughly 8,000 staff have moved out of Huawei's offices to a new headquarters also in the southern city of Shenzhen. Around 50% were involved in R&D, Zhao said.The same day, a letter from Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei was posted on Huawei's employee messageboard, saying that the company would have to focus its R&D efforts and cut some products due to the U.S. action.Ren's letter was dated June, before the Honor sale.Tightening rounds of U.S. restrictions have choked off Huawei's access to advanced U.S. chip technology, damaging its phone business. The United States alleges that Huawei's equipment poses a security risk, a charge the company denies."
"All this chatter about blue proxy cards, white proxy cards, shred this one, mail in this one, yad, yada, yada. 78% of all shares are owned by institutions. It's their votes who will decide."
as i see it you can now hold qcom for 5 yrs and it will fly much much higher
Being short is a really bad idea. Look at the call options. Pointing to 90 plus.
Ever notice Don is like Pavlov's Dog whenever someone mentions the large 5G opportunity and how it is and will continue to be good for QCOM?
"it's a shame that delegating and NOT being a control freak is hurting qcom. it's always been my biggest issue, even in my own business, when pressed on DOING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE. years ago qcom had KYOCERA a cell phone makingtheir own handsets and could control more. in the case e of manufacturing their OWN chips it may not be as profitable to do so but you are control your inventory. so now they make TSMC and Samsung fat cats and are forced to eat garbage because they control everything. also who knows if this is t a deliberate slow down to push another companies technology as a substitute for qcom. either way a rookie mistake and way too much exposure to outside influences. havng a control freak mentality has its benefits"
oh thank God
"When AVGO was bidding for QCOM, as a shareholder, I was getting proxy info in the mail and getting phone calls to vote a certain way. Today, I get one from QCOM and part of the letter reads..""

Who should we thank?"
great interview! although I have not discovered anything new for myself. my confidence in the company goes through the roof. I listened with great pleasure. it’s good when the company is run by people who know it from the very beginning and from the bottom.

"this isn't complicated, China agreed that Apple was in violation of the contractual agreement. first Apple says it only affects older phones, then Apple says they are not going to stop selling any phones in China, then Apple says they are updating their software next week and it won't matter anymore. this is desperation at it's best. Apple has lost and now they are in negotiating mode with QCOM. Watch for Apple to announce before end of Q1 that ""an agreement with QCOM has been reached that was fair to both parties"". disaster for Apple."
This sell off tells me most investors still only have a very weak understanding of the company
Many companies are doing chip as there a lot of govt grants. Qualcomm can fly....

"This might be what's moving us today......Huawei may sell premium phone brands - sourcesMon, January 25, 2021, 5:41 AMHuawei may sell premium smartphone brands P and Mate. That's according to two Reuters sources. Talks are reportedly ongoing with a consortium led by Shanghai government-backed investment firms. Huawei has denied the report, saying there is no merit in it. Shanghai officials said they weren't aware of the situation. One of the sources says Huawei started exploring a possible sale as early as last September. It's apparently motivated by insufficient access to chip supplies amid U.S. sanctions. Since May 2019 Huawei has faced restrictions over allegations that it's a threat to national security. The sources say the potential divestment is a sign the firm doesn't expect relief from U.S. sanctions, even a with a new administration in Washington. Now any divestment could be a very big deal. Shipments of P and Mate phones were worth 39.7 billion dollars over the year to the third quarter of 2020. Last year Huawei sold off phone brand Honor in a deal one source valued at about 15.5 billion dollars. That seems to have helped the budget handset maker, which last week said it had deals with firms including Intel and Qualcomm over chip supplies."

Big money going into options...this star is rising
if we only get the right management then QCOM will fly. remember $80 was too low of an offer. now they want you to sell your shares $60:67.
"My guess is QCOM has indicators for when to settle NXPI as the price keeps going up (118/share). The other issue is timing as they need a powerful newsworthy story to effect the price of their own stock in an upward position to score an important victory against Broadcom and to preserve shareholder trust and loyalty for the long term battle with them and afterwards. Overall I really don't think QCOM will merge for various reasons (anti-trust issues, national security concerns/trends, potential loss of innovation, and potential impact on the industry as a whole in terms of balance of power structures). Thoughts?"
How does the government expect QCOM to recover the 5.5 Billion it spends per year on research if they can't charge a fair price for the use of their patents?
it is calm before storm.Earning aapl is Oct 29 and qcom Nov 4th.Look like aaple /qcom will address chinese effects on earning.Qcom will balance by more business thought usa and world likely.Also a lineup of 5 g innovation and products .Good luck
This is ridiculous. QCOM has given back all its gains from the good earnings report and then some. Numerous guests on CNBC like Qcom and say its a buy yet the stock moves up a little one day and drops lower the next. So much for a stock market that is based on earnings or future outlook. Imo it seems like a manipulation on any given day what stocks move based on what or who is moving them?? GME is a perfect example.
Soaring. QCOM is back for strong bullish trend.
"I am curious. I understand that QCOM has done everything in their power to prevent the acquisition. However, had they let it go to a vote and a deal and then CFIUS step in (as is normal) to review the transaaction, would that have not triggered the cash payment from AVGO to QCOM or is CFIUS not a regulatory approval?"
Hold!!!
"I'm holding on for dear life. They've got supply issues, but so does everyone else. Things are gonna go well for QCOM and all other chip manufacturers once supply catches up with demand. This is a good problem to have."

"This could be a top second half of the year stock, and a good quarter and solid guidance could see this stock soar, with the rollout hype of a 5G iPhone in September. Good risk reward here. The $120 August or September calls could be a winner in IMO."
"Here is what Qualcomm really said in their CC and it doesnt look good, their words not mine, https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-deal-doesnt-solve-qualcomms-problems-2019-05-01?mod=mw_latestnews"
"filled the gap,waiting on nasdaq to be done then qcom is ready for a couple steady months of growth.amazing shopping day today."
Some food for thought: What if the QCOM moved their headquarters to Texas? Their high-court recently upheld percentage of mobile device as a valid FRAND charge.
"0.50% up in a bloodbath it tells me sth. Buy and hold, 1k stocks added."
WE now know that QCOM would have lost the vote to AVGO WITH the purchase of NXPI. So it looks like now the CIFIUS intervention is just delaying the inevitable. NXPI wasn’t the poison pill QCOM hoped for. The only other nuclear option they have left is to walk away from NXPI and announce a massive buyback of the stock to stop the deal. Anybody have any other thoughts on how they could stop it??
"Looks like more ""Dominance in 5G modems for QCOM""..... read comments at the bottom for sure!!Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM recently unveiled Snapdragon-backed third-generation 5G modem — X60. Upping its 5G chip dominance in the global market, the much-awaited launch is likely to boost network performance and provide flexibility to operators with optimized spectrum resources, in the face of universal migration from 4G to full-fledged 5G ecosystem.Looks like the old Intel 5G engineers now owned by Apple, are now 4 years behind QCOM instead of just 2 years!! The new X60 will leave them in the dust!! Well done QCOM!!"
This is huuuge. Qualcomm selling 4g. To Huawei. Here we go 150. Plus. Take off.
Dropped 7% on nothing has changed. Old news. Looks like add the dip
It's looking like all the Nasdaq 100 stock have flatted out at best... the markets will be in trouble with in 2021.
"QCOM's 5G technology is worth more than this current price. AVGO knows and Apple only care of their profits margin. Without QCOM's custom chips, Apple won't go anywhere to power up Apple like in the past. iPhone X is good example that they using Intel chip and Apple will stop making the iPhone X in the second half of the year with no good sales. Apple no innovation without Steve Jobs and will collapse after many years to come. Apple is one who stirring the pot with QCOM without all issues that Apple uses its dominated market power because of its biggest customer with other suppliers to accuse QCOM. Apple has no choice on 5G technology in the future. QCOM should cutoff any of 5G technology with Apple and let their products to become antique. >> http://bgr.com/2018/02/02/iphone-x-discontinued-second-half-2018/"
January 1st 2021 = QCOM = $148.50 !!!!!!! $137+ by Friday
Considering NXPI just hit it out of the park... I expect good things from QCOM!
"Looks like the real thing, Volume up big time. Should trade 2 and 1/2 times normal volume today."
qcom hope was pricing power now they have none aapl cut qcom off at the knees. I guess GS analyst was correct like Oman said in the last earnings q&a session. Hopefully not back to fill the $100 gap. OMG
I expect QCOM to finish green with strong volume at the end of today just like yesterday... someone is accumulating. Very positive!!!!
I actually prefer this timing. Like bury it now w/ the holiday and don't give time to irrational sellers who might otherwise act hastily. Perhaps some pieces will be written to calm the market and put things in perspective.
"Be a smart investor, do your homework by researching the stock and the market that it competes in to make good buying/selling decisions. Pay attention to good reputable outlets that are sincere in trying to help investors be successful. Ignore the fake articles and constant reprints of old bad news, paid for by those trying to get price lowered for their own personal goals of buying into stocks at lower prices. And.....be careful of following any advice given on these conversation forums. When a great company's stock which I've learned has a great future gets beaten down for no good reason, I watch price sink, and then when it starts to climb again is when I'll buy some shares again. Good luck!"
Broadcom stock prices will be under stress soon. I prefer full cash offer rather than partial stock offer. Qualcomm will be 110 soon if second bidder comes
For the record the Chinese will not approve the buy-out of ARM by NVDA! Take it to the bank! Will not happen.
"The chip company Qualcomm has won in its patent dispute with Apple, a sales ban in Germany, which could be affected by several iPhone models. The Munich Regional Court stated on Thursday the violation of a Qualcomm patent by Apple. Qualcomm can provisionally enforce the judgment for a security of #$%$ 668.4 million for two patent related trials. It's about the model series from the iPhone 7 to the iPhone X from last year. In addition, Apple should pay damages to Qualcomm."
"Earnings prediction, $1.80 on $7.8 billion, guide for $7.5 billion middle of range they give on $1.67, stock finishes at $144 for the day tomorrow. This is what I hope for (of course more in stock price)"
this really needs to go up this week. need a close above 140 tomorrow and above 144 by Friday.
What? green after EU fine? : ) why not selling? keep holding through the fire and water.
"@Don @Fake Rick, they would know with years of comparable experience: Why am I here day after day, week after week, year after year, when I have no investment in QCOM?? What is wrong with me?"
Some analysts keeping their Buy rating as well as Evercore analyst who is staying with Buy rating as well as keeping their price target unchanged at $105 despite the news. Lots of price targets still being kept above $90. Though meaningless in our current reality this is good news in a hectic time.
"qcom management has no brain. they don't know how to deal with investors and how to convince Wall Street. the future of qualcomm stock is too dark if we keep the same management. in this situation, we should ask the company to sell to others."
Apple won the media round. QCOM won the factual round. Will there be any round 3? Interesting times ahead.
Target $120 
Going up baby
Qualcomm $98 before earnings $120 after.
BOD says if nxpi deal doesn’t go thru they will buy back shares using that cash
"Let's see, AVGO comes along and makes an offer at $70; the stock price jumps immediately. QCOM rejects the offer and the stock price starts to drop. QCOM revises their offer to $82 and QCOM immediately rejects the offer; the stock does nothing. QCOM overpays for NXPI and AVGO reduces offer to $79; the stock starts to drop. FT reports that QCOM might entertain a sale to AVGO; the stock jumps. The FT article is seen as Kabuki and QCOM is not serious; the stock drops. Markets don't lie. Vote Blue."
Nice to read about the CEOs 3.5 M bonus as the shareholders got a 0 increase in our dividend
"More info including first indication QCOM customers are gaining 5G phone market share previously held by Huawei.Global smartphone shipments are likely to grow nearly 50% on year to 340 million units in the first quarter of 2021, driven by robust sales of Apple's iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone Pro Max as well as a ramp-up in shipments by Chinese brands to grab the market share relinquished by Huawei, according to Digitimes Research."
Gotcha!!! All the naysayers including myself. qcomey says VENGEANCE IS MINE!!! HAHA
"Today was a bad market to have this great news come out, goonies are selling tech. Analyst up-grades will follow maybe tomorrow."
Just bought another 500 shares and I have some dry powder left. We may go under 120 today I will pull the trigger on another 500 shares.
"Qualcomm has performed very poorly since last earnings report vs other semiconductor stocks. For example, this is still down 18% off it’s 52 week high while the average of other semiconductor chip stocks are only down 5%. The market really has not liked this stock for many years, of course between 2008-2019 was a disaster. It has also underperformed its peers to the upside by a large margin since the March lows of last year. It’s just not well liked, that’s my opinion"
"I feel like aapl can't really like this PR around the trial can they? I mean, they're on the same side as Huawei, fresh on the heels of powerful indictments, fighting a u.s. tech innovation leader, over what is seeming to everyone like a relatively modest price to pay for technology that makes their flagship product work. Granted, I'm long a pile of qcom calls, but I just feel like Timmy C and his formerly cool company now look like greedy bullies in bed w/ those trying to harm us. $1,000 phone anyone?"
"What a difference 4 days makes, the headlines last Thursday night were SCREAMING, about how QCOM was DOOMED because APPL was going to start building their own modems ( kindly notice that the words TRY & ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP) were rarely if EVER mentioned in the AGENDA DRIVEN headlines of the financial media that is complicit with the big people that run Wall Street and who reward these gift seeking journalists with rewards for a job well done when they have used their megaphone to scream FIRE in a crowded theater.Well that was Thursday and despite the efforts of many here to shore up the defenses against maligning stories by pointing out the FACTS like APPLE only has a world wide market share against Android of approximately 15%, or that this was recycled news, which we've known about for over a year, the flash crash was allowed to clean the clocks of ill informed investors who bought in because of the headlines and a chance to ride the wave without researching what they owned and the future potential of 5G and the company that holds the lead in almost every aspect of it because they basically developed it.Well this evenings headline that caught my eye and inspired my mini rant against the manipulation that allowed 25,923,100 on Friday and 12,258,500 shares on Monday to be traded shaking out God knows how many small investors, is this... Qualcomm Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know & then the story goes on to say, the Zacks story goes on to say that Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.29 billion, up 63.29% from the year-ago period. I only put the snippet in to give the gist of the article, because you can research the article, but it was too long to post and probably would have been cut.The bottom line is that they did the temporary damage, achieved their goals and now everything is going to be bright and sunny again, because they picked up MILLIONS of shares on the cheap.Only time will tell, but lets see if the days ahead prove me and others right, about the dishonesty of our corrupt media and the journalists who align themselves with dishonest people."
qcom in 5g everywhere not dependent on just aapl like swks is. only thing is swks has fewer shares able to skyrocket stockwhereas qcom is mega cap company huge # of shares and moves like an aircraft carrier
"""It is the board's unanimous belief that Broadcom's proposal significantly undervalues Qualcomm relative to the company's leadership position in mobile technology and our future growth prospects,"" --- note to myself: get over it :)"
"China(Huawei) is asking US(Verizon) to pay 1B for the use of patent. US(FTC) is asking US(Qualcomm) not to charge much to China(Huawei/Vivo/Oppo/Xiaomi/OnePlus/Samsung) for the use of patent. Well done, smart Americans!"
coming up to earnings is going to be great
"Longs - this company in just 1 month will have an EPS (TTM) of something like $6.50. They have beat earnings expectations 4 quarters in row... the economy is expanding and 5G is at the center of it. There is really nothing to be concerned about, let this gyration pass. This stock goes up very fast as we have seen - average down now. Take advantage of this and make money with the smart money."
"Article on mobile world live this morning cites China smartphone sales were down last quarter, but of those sold 55% were 5G. That's good for QCOM and for those of us invested in it."
I love it! Lots of press today on Qcom vs Apple lawsuit. Good stuff.
"2 of the biggest American tech companies battle it out in courts.Meanwhile China and Korea are developing technology, winning customers and taking a good chunk of the market away.Who is winning Apple or Qualcomm? Neither, the lawyers are winning.You know who else is winning? Corporations with the tax cut. THEY ARE NOT PASSING IT DOWN TO THE WORKERS.Notice the lack of bonuses this year AND wages are not moving down to the labor force."
"I’m Not in QCOM, However... An Honest Opinion= way up after earnings... almost all chip stocks have been..."
Qualcomm ready to beat expectations $200 coming
FTC rests it's case with QCOM and not to go to supreme court.
Qualcomedy didn't go down today and it is a 100% guarantee the Detroit Lions won't lose tomorrow.
"somebody please explain to me, if QCOM is guilty in EU, APPLE should be too, right?"
Didn’t management say $80 a share undervalued the company? Ha
"Explosion time. Those who bought into the face of rising rates(rising to a STILL extremely low 1.5-175), will be proven both right and rich. Cyclical effects also effect semi-conductors, and as the economy super-charges and more and more businesses invest in advanced data transfer, wifi, etc. Qualcomm and similar companies will continue to outperform. Buying and holding, won't trim until 170."
"Qualcomm is heading past $175 folks! Awesome company to own, will be a leader in autonomous driving, AI, 5G, and so many other industries, that’s the reason Broadcom wanted to purchase Qualcomm, it’s the best out there"
if qcom goes to $120 what would the P/E be?
I sold a little at 145 but not at this new lows. back to 143 in no time you will see
06:46 TodayQualcomm price target raised to $170 from $163 at Mizuho
Div today?
"Back to 120s, should see 110 next week"
"If public criticism by a sitting FTC commissioner isn’t damning enough, Judge Koh also got schooled by the erudite New York University law professor Richard Epstein for her “disastrous opinion.” He noted how “Judge Koh concedes the [patent licensing] practices challenged are not ‘collusive, coercive, predatory or exclusionary in character,’ and thus she has to rely on some residual notion of antitrust ‘unfairness’ that has no structure or content.”"
Will never see 130s again.. for next decade
This is total hedge fund manipulation. Don’t fall for it folks. Give it a week or so and you’ll be back. Notice it dropped even before the earnings announcement at 4:45PM?? The slight miss (0.4%) was simply the narrative they chose to explain the drop. But they are using counterfeit shares so just don’t sell and they won’t make any money.
"On May 19th, they have a 5G Summit. I hope they bring something serious to showcase. Seems like no one cares about the great profitability and dividend. Personally makes no sense what has happened but I am going to continue to hold for the next 6 months."
"With options expiring today I wouldn't be surprised to see a deal over the long week end. QCOM management really has to look at the offer and find a real valid reason if the choose not to accept or they will be sued for every thing they own. While $82 isn't an unbelievably great offer, it is still about a 30% premium to the current price. I would love to see BRCM boost the offer to about 90, which they certainly can afford and I think that would seal the deal."

"Happy Holidays! QCOM currently has 39% of a market that doubled quarter over quarter to 17% of all phones sold. In the words of the late great Harry Carey, “HOLY COW”! See below, Qualcomm was the biggest 5G chipset vendor in the third quarter of 2020, powering 39% of the 5G phones sold worldwide, Counterpoint indicated. Meanwhile, sales of 5G smartphones doubled during the quarter, accounting for 17% of all smartphones sold."
"I hope management is taking advantage of the low stock price and buying back shares. Once the market stabilizes, the share price will recover to the $60's. With the pressure that the lawsuits are having, we should see a settlement in the first quarter or at the latest by the second quarter. By the third quarter, those that bought at the current price will be glad that they did."
"I guess I’m in the small minority that thinks qcom can get to $70 and much higher on its own with Broadcom. And I also don’t want any Broadcom shares. They might think that their stock sweetens the deal or something, but I got 0 interest in their stock. My vote doesn’t really matter, but this is my opinion on this deal."
EOD $135.6 Unfortunately....bleeding days ahead....take ur profit & wait for dip
Don't worry. Even people in Wuhan use qualcomm powered cell phones
QCOM is a BUY!
I can imagine weak rebound today.
"A couple of days ago they reported QCOM nearing buying point. Citi downgrades from194 to 165 citing cost pressures like what happened when 4G matured. 5G is barely underway. Not sure I follow why such opposing information. QCOM is a good company, solid dividend and future of 5G. A 160”s price point seems reasonable to future and peers IMO"
It would be wise to understand that the expected forward guidance we are all anticipating is going to be conservative just to avoid any future legal problems from shareholder lawsuits complaining that the company misrepresented their earnings growth rates.
"HONOR 50 series tipped to feature Qualcomm Snapdragon SM7325 chipsetAnyway, talking about the new leak by Digital Chat Station, one of the smartphones in the HONOR 50 series will be powered by an unreleased Qualcomm Snapdragon SM7325 platform. As per him, the chipset will debut first on this lineup. Unfortunately, he did not specifically mention the model that will be housing this SoC.For those unaware, this is not the first time we are hearing about SM7325. According to Roland Quandt (popular leaker), this SoC will be a toned-down version of the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 775G."
"QCOM is now below 2008 levels. No stock appreciation during the entire smartphone revolution. But don’t worry, if 5G doesn’t help - there’s always 6G to look forward to."

Where are the news releases from 5g Summit?
"From Dow Jones....Qualcomm said the settlement will boost add about $2 a share ""as product shipments ramp"" but did not provide a time period for the earnings boost.Put a 15x multiple on that and you get 30 bucks of price appreciation from the 58 range. I'd like to see addtional comments on the eps impact, but that's a good start."

About 15 million of the 21.3 million smartphones shipped during the month had a fifth-generation connection, underscoring the country’s fast transition to the next-gen cellular standard. Oppo and compatriot rivals like Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo are in hot pursuit of the market share expected to be vacated by Huawei, China’s leading smartphone vendor which no longer has access to key chipmaking suppliers owing to U.S. sanctions."

I would not be surprised if QCOM did not make a run at XLNX it is about the same market cap as NXP and zero debt and 2 billion in cash!! Seems it would be a great fit with QCOM they both are top tear in 5G.It would make a super power house in 5G!!!
151.4 Day High;
Lot of $65 calls for Friday sitting open right now. Be interesting to see the movement tomorrow after the AVGO earnings call.
With NXPI 41 points lower than their offering price of $127 they must feel at least fortunate!

Tomorrow is D Day. Up 20% or down 20%.

"It's entirely possible that the share price could rise if the NXPI deal does go through and AVGO walks. HOWEVER ... what is extremely troubling here - and should be to any QCOM investor, are the optics that the QCOM board has displayed in terms of circumventing the shareholder voting process and usurping the rights of shareholders. That is unforgivable, IMO."
Could this article be the reason for the rise ? Sound too good to be true.https://www.zdnet.com/article/qualcomm-meet-the-new-boss-of-everything-mobile/?ref=yfp
anybody add at around 134 because I did
AVGO wanted to get a hold of QCOM's cash and yes QCOM wants to make itself less desirable. The market price won't adjust until there is a serious offer....

According to DigiTimes, the new smartphone could launch as early as this year. Qualcomm has already scheduled an event for 1st December where it is said to reveal its flagship chip Snapdragon 875. New smartphones powered by the chip usually ship in Q1 of the following year after that. The joint purchasing agreement also hints that the phone might be launched under Republic Of Gamers (ROG).Asus Qualcomm is expected to launch the device at the same launch event. All the details regarding the chip will be shared by Qualcomm at an event and it is now expected that a device launch also awaits at this event as well. This comes after Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon 835 chipset, which was first unveiled on Wednesday. The chip has been paired with Android Nougat’s Adreno 4000 processor. It can handle up to 16GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage. A smartphone launch will also take place simultaneously."
Not even 2 hours and almost 9 million shares already. Hope there will be more coming.
"At this point if someone offered $150/share, the current BoD's would reject it."
"Cramer just highlighted how bad the shorts got hosed and their covers pushed Qcom up. But, he said, its a great company and should have more room to grow from here. He covered why the stock was in the mid 50's due to the law suit last week and not that its over and Apple is now a customer, QCom should be a fun stock to watch."
"Not only do I think QCOM is the best investment in the 5G arena but is also the best investment in Artificial Intelligence areas as well,certainly the best combination of both. It also pays a handsome and growing dividend while I wait. I recently increased my position and will continue to do so as opportunities present themselves. If anyone knows of a better choice I would certainly welcome your substantiated choice."
it is kind of unbelievable for the NASDAQ to be up almost 1% and for QCOM to be down this way. I know it takes a strong belief in this stock and their leadership in one of the most exciting technologies going right now to stay long. But that is exactly what one needs to do if they keep their eyes on the future and not on day to day trades.
Don't understand why my jun and jul 90.00 call options went down when QCOM went up 0.77 yesterday?
"Not sure if anyone posted this yet, but it's a QCOM website release about mm wave technology in Japan, they're going to blow the doors off any skeptics when the results start being reported!https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2021/05/12/successful-5g-mmwave-deployment-look-japan"
"I've ridden this roller coaster through thick and thin and while my friends sold when they doubled their investment in QCOM, I held and now I am up over 1,000 % (yes, thousand). I've actually made so much money that I will simply hold and pass on to my children so the massive capital gain will not be taxed. Going verrrrrrrry loooooong! Patience is a virtue :-)"
Dead money.
Massive moves toward 100
The difference between Qualcomm's dealings with Chinese companies and Broadcom's dealings with Chinese companies is that Qualcomm is a United States company and is obligated to observe United States law in how they conduct themselves and those transactions and Broadcom being a foreign company does not have such obligations they do not have to abide by any US laws in their dealings with anyone. That is the difference. They're comparing apples and oranges and trying to cloud the issues. Their level of desperation is growing as it becomes more and apparent that this deal is dead before it was ever struck.
"Stock is being overly punished. Y'all sell if you want, I'll buy your shares at a discount."
"Looks like AAPL big meeting will be Sept 10th to announce their 5G phones. For the uninformed, this is only the beginning of at least 4 yrs for QCOM chips being used in AAPL phones."
Is $65 qcom a reasonable entry point.?Need expertise opinion please.!?
QCOM will make so much money this year that the Treasury won’t have to print any.
Read the AVGO response. Still pretty much Kabuki but AVGO now will to negotiate comprehensively which would include price.
"Hey, given Broadcom offered $82 (before reducing to $79, which was a bit petulant in my view)< and now Qualcomm say they would accept $90, it seems to me a deal is possible in between. The distance is not big really. Regarding the break-up fee, even if 9-10% of enterprise value, it should be slightly more than $10 billion, more than $8 billion proposed by Broadcom, but not in a different ball-park.Conclusion: a deal is possible and likely in the mid $80s."
"From QCOM earlier today.Qualcomm Leads in 5G Speed, According to Recent Ookla Speedtest Analysis With 5G becoming increasingly accessible worldwide, carriers and consumers face the challenge of respectively supporting and selecting smartphones that will enable them to enjoy the benefits brought by rapid, unprecedented speeds. A recent Ookla Speedtest analysis reveals Qualcomm Technologies as the leader providing these benefits. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 and Snapdragon 855+ 5G mobile platforms ranked as the fastest chipsets in the U.S., with the latter delivering 67 percent faster average download speeds — across all technologies — than its closest competitor. In the UK, the analysis found the fastest 5G device is the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G powered by the Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF System. Furthermore, the Snapdragon superiority in the UK is not limited to 5G. 4G LTE devices powered by Snapdragon averaged download speeds that are 44 percent faster than devices with MediaTek modems. The devices powered by the Snapdragon Modem-RF System that deliver faster speeds, uses network resources more efficiently improving overall network performance and extending improved streaming and browsing experiences to all users on the network, not just those using Snapdragon powered devices."
"Q for those that really know this stuff: Would the china govt impeded, at least for now, a deal between huawei and qcom? Do they lose even a small amount of leverage if one of our national 5g champions gains a benefit? Granted, huawei would benefit too, but I think a deal would be seen as more of a win for qcom than huawei. Thoughts?"
"This is on no news, just a head fake! Hang tough! Looking to drive out the traders!For the record I'm and ""Investor"" been here for years, long term is bright!!Forward revenue is off the chart!"
"As I reflect on the Apple/Qualcomm situation I now realize that the intended outcome was to hold down Qualcomm’s Market Cap over a period of time to reduce Qcom’s ability to use its stock as a currency for buying companies in the race to AI, AU, VR, XR, ADAS supremacy. The Key move for Apple was to settle with Qcom to get Apple’s market cap moving higher while at the same time hoodwinking the FTC to continue prosecuting its shameless and ill conceived antilawsuit that continues to hold down Qualcomm’s stock price. The FTC is a pawn and were used by probably the biggest monopoly the world has ever known."
"Appaloosa LP takes share stake in Qualcomm: 600,000 shares to be exact."
"Remember 5g is not about phones!! Its about autonomous cars, wearables, smarthomes, data centers, medical applications, manufacture processement, virtual glasses, gaming, streaming and etc.Apple was just the cherry on the cake!!!This stock in 5 years will have eps of 15 easily!!! With Intel dropping 5g, Qcom has monopoly in the western world!!"
once tan domiciles in the U.S. he will probably make another attempt. if he offers 115-125 and nxp still isn't close to closing I could see this happening. the govt may put some teeth in it but the game changes once he's officially a U.S. company.
Samsung just posted good numbers. Up 45%!!!
"How is it that Trump has no inhibitions on talking about anything, including trying to influence the supposedly independent fed, or railing about cnn and telling people to cancel their subs, thereby hurting ATT, yet is closemouthed about a judge's ruling the could severely damage his ""champion"" of one of his most prized objectives......winning 5g. Come on Donnie, now is when we actually want to hear you rail."
The best way to invest in 5G. I challenge anyone to name a better all around play.
"So I did some calculation: the Q1 FY21 Estimates of diluted EPS are $1.67-$1.87. This means the EPS could go up to the range of $5.6-$6.1. At the current share price of around $147, the PE then decreases to about 26~24. If the share trades at about the current PE of 32, the share could go up to $179.84 - $195.2. This implies a further 22%-32% upside, or on average 27% upside. SUPER BULLISH!!"
Well the sentiment on the street reversed now and more on the side of Qcom: Qcom is valued more than the $79 Offer and they dont think Avgo is serious enough. It is unwise not to raise the offer before the meeting. If they offer $85 now and qcom still refuses well at least they will guarantee the 6 spots. They will get my vote but now still undecided.
Think it will break $70 here soon?
"Investing is NOT about finding a good company with great profits and unbelievable forward guidance, it's about manipulating money and an SEC that doesn't care."
Way undervalued
Qualcomedy Don is very active again. That means this will go up again.
Why hard drop
The details of losing AAPL’s modem chip business isn’t very well enunciated by the company. My take is that they actually will end up better off as they will switch from building and selling AAPL modems with their IP to licensing their IP for a hefty royalty and then turning the precious excess fab capacity to other products. Net/net they will end up ahead and margins should rise as they combine the same output from the fabs with incremental royalty from AAPL. Oh by the way wasn’t there a fear last year of losing Huawei’s business? And didn’t it happen? And aren’t earnings and revenue still actually climbing in spite of it?
"Sony announces the the Sony Xperia 1 with Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC""When it comes to overall performance and platform capabilities, the Xperia 1 is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC paired with 6 GB of LPDDR4X as well as 64 or 128 GB of NAND flash memory.

Why is this stock stagnant while other chip producers are green￼?
"I like this analogy of Koh decision. It makes sense.""Therefore, no license, no chip is the means by which a chipmaker and/or IP owner grants a chip buyer the right to actually use those chips in devices, which is usually the point. That is how chip “users” become licensees. The only reason anyone would ever want to buy Qualcomm chips without their associated licensing would be if they had no intention of ever actually using them or any of their IP. Like, for instance, if someone wanted to build a giant yard statue made of computer chips, or tile the bottom of their pool with a mosaic of cellular modems. (Please don’t try it. It is a terrible idea.) If Judge Koh was thinking about arts and crafts and decorative uses for cellular modems, I can understand part of her decision, but if she was thinking about legitimate technology and business uses for cellular modems, her failure to understand this elementary, standard licensing model is difficult for me to wrap my head around."""
The long term best situation for QCOM is to acquire NXPI and remain independent. End of story.
"There is an old saying… “”WHERE THERE IS SMOKE THERE IS FIRE”” well this is just a sampling of this morning’s email alerts that I received today, proving that this market potential and QCOM and others are no longer the best kept secrets, I am seeing offerings of reports, that I assume are tailored to institutional investors, or higher end financial advisors, because as well off as some of us are doing with our investments, we don’t need to spend the thousands that they are selling these reports for to tell us what we already figured out eighteen months ago.I’m trying to post this in this format for two reasons, I don’t want to inundate the board with individual posts and I’m hoping to slide these through without the robotic screening shutting it down, keep in mind that some are stories and some are offers of reports on the industry and market potential being offered for sale, simple searches for the text will hopefully guide you if you so choose to do so, but to use another old saying that kind of sums up how I feel at this time… “”ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME”” and that seems to be the way our futures are shaping up.Fridays market move did not only move QCOM, it moved every 5G related chip stock I own, so it sure appears that the entire 5G market is coming out of the shadows and into the light.GLTAChina is going to build 1 million new 5G stations in 2021Actual Reality Gaming Market Set to Register healthy CAGR During 2020-2028PLI (Production Linked Incentive) scheme puts India in 'great position' for future says Qualcomm VPGlobal Consumer Internet of Things Market Expected To Reach Highest CAGR By 2026: Qualcomm, Decoding the Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem for the Telecoms Market 2020 (this is a report) offering an In Depth Analysis of Industry Share, Size and the Growth Outlook up to 2026Global MulteFire Market 2026, who the leading Industry Players are, Qualcomm, Nokia, EricssonUpdate Report on Global Artificial Intelligence in the Automotive Market in 2020, Analysis by Types.

Sure feels like forced capitulation by hedge funds and market makers to get retail investors to sell their shares before 2nd half run up.
"Bruce, retail investors aren’t in this stock, more like nvidia they are in to. QCOM is simply not a beloved stock and continues to be disconnected"
$88.67 today. $95.66 after market close. my goldfish predict.

More smart money needs to come in. This is actually happening but bit slowly. Buybacks now could also be a good thing."
bought this at $147 ... loosing way too much money. Sad people are buying fake money..
Is Tepper or Appaloosa in this stock? It looks like the type of plays he pulls. He plays short games against his long positions.
QCOM is a late bloomer. Wait till every other tech stock slows down. This one will accelerate

Especially since Qualcomm’s market share declined significantly when Mediatek entered the CDMA market and Apple migrated to Intel modems. Whatever advantage Qualcomm had by being first to market with new technologies has been repeatedly mitigated over time by competitors such as Intel, MediaTek, Samsung, and HiSilicon.I will be attending future court dates as my schedule allows to see how the case proceeds. And remember, the burden of proof is on the FTC that Qualcomm stifled competition and caused harm to consumers (through higher prices).Based on this article QCOM is in the right; plain and simple!!"

Problem is￼ Wall Street likes the hype. Qualcomm is real deal for a long time. Someone shorted this big time. No way 167 to 123 for a company this sound. They will have to blow the doors off for sure.I wish they go private or sell. So mis understood. I don’t get it.

Let us explain the innocence of it!It's clear more than ever: FTC is Apple's puppet, and nothing more."
We can all debate white VS blue all day but I realize that this vote realistically comes down to the 80% ownership of the institutional investors and I’m sure QCOM and AVGO have had meetings/discussions with all of them to try to secure their votes. This question is if the institutional investors believe in the QCOM board or if they are frustrated by its under performance and see voting for blue as the better investment. The compromise of only voting in 4 or 5 AVGO nominated members may just be how this all shakes out to keep negotiations going but not completely give in to AVGOs current offer.
"Just looked up how much Intel spent on modem development - and failed. Upward of $10B; during 5G modem development Intel was spending upward of $2B/year. They were very happy to call it a day and offload its IP and team to Apple; and how much is that IP really worth? Also why is Apple trying to recruit from Q? I suspect most of the cream from Intel's modem team is gone, so no wonder Apple is trying to recruit from Q, but with recent Q stock rise these engineers likely staying put vesting their RSUs."

"On top of 5G and Apple settlement, more are expected soon: settlements with FTC to further strengthen Qualcomm licenses models, long term deal with Huawei on licensing with the short term deal due by June. Further eroding of PC market with Qualcomm better connectivity.

New development in adjacent market possibly in AI soon. The areas of Qualcomm markets are much broader and strongest than before now. All these are very exciting points to drive Qualcomm shares higher and ever higher. Let us check out on post quarterly results on 1st of May."

It is real cheap no brainer stock. BUY in advance because Huawei needs QCOM chipset for the high end smart phone. I guess HUAWEI will have to make an early move for 5G in Asia by July to steal the show. Huawei has vertical platform both hardware and smart phone. It will move fast in order to dominate 5G and extend more lead. It is an end game for I-phone or Samsung.

look at my qcom boy. got in at $146 thinking it was a good dip. nope
This will go crazy the few weeks.. let's go :)
Next week $90 before esrnings then $120...It held today because of expiring $80 calls... But after dividend increase announcement and buyback.... plus guidance increase from 30 deals signed at CES
"News flash on new QCOM Snapdragon Modem Chip, from Barrons; below a snipe of the article.Alex Katouzian, a senior vice president for mobile at Qualcomm, said the chips would be capable of 26 trillion operations per second, referring to a measure of how a processor will perform when given artificial intelligence-related tasks. Features that are found in flagship Qualcomm chips typically trickle down to the less expensive chips, eventually leading to less costly smartphones outperforming older, top-of-the-line models.The new chips will use the so-called five-nanometer manufacturing process, which refers to the size of transistors and the density at which they can be printed on a chip. Using the more advanced manufacturing process will likely mean the chips will use less energy."
"Here come the analysts in defense.....Qualcomm pullback on Apple modem report a buying opportunity, says Canaccord Qualcomm (QCOM) shares have pulled back after Bloomberg reported that Apple (AAPL) has begun building its own cellular modem to be used in future devices, but Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley sees the dip as a buying opportunity given that this news ""should be expected"" after Apple paid $1B for Intel's (INTC) modem business. T. Michael Walkley still sees Qualcomm being well-positioned to benefit from the long-term 5G cycle and keeps a Buy rating and $175 price target on Qualcomm shares."

I'm voting the BLUE card with my shares. I'm firmly for the merger and a meaningful discussion between the two boards.
QCOM looks timely. Just my 2c.
Why is the semisc industry down today?
"Let me start by saying I have been a QCOM stock holder for 20 years. I have made large multiples on my investment(s). This includes taking $$$ off the table to cover my original investment five times over. So I can't complain! But how does a company that owns the IP for for ""X"" generations (2G - 5G and beyond) for mobile cellular technology consistently not able to blow out their numbers. I am not even including other areas that QCOM plays in (e.g. automobile, fitness). Management has no ability to ""manage"" the street. They should all be thrown out instead of patting each other on the back. With all that said I continue to be long with QCOM."

"surprised the board is this quiet. stock is way up on a down tape, including the ^sox down. one would think there is something positive for sure......one would think. generally, this type of thing (SM's interview last night causing an uptick) would get tamped down pretty quick. not at all the case today. finally something positive. let's hope we get confirmation that it's real and it lasts."

"Thumps up if you agree!! Below....The FTC ruling by Lucy Koh has to be one of the most outrages attacks on “Capitalism” to ever be made.Pandora’s Box has been opened and this will turn the Technology world upside down! The simple principals of making money from patents and IP, is a foundation of our high tech world. God help us!This is not just one small step against Capitalism it is a giant leap against Capitalism, only the warped brain of a pure socialist could make such a ruling. A good comparison would be; making Tom Brady pass the football left handed, make Michael Jordon wear 15 pound ankle weights, and make Tiger Woods cut 6 inches off the length of his golf clubs.To punish an American company in this case Qualcomm for excelling in their field of Technology because they make the best Communication chips in the world is insane. Just because a company has the best Engineers and Engineers with the most experience, that work hardest and strife to make the best product possible, and to issue punishment for that hard work, and skill is shameful and wrong!I’m sure Lenin, Castro, Chavez, and Madura, are all smiling right now. Lucy Koh just handed China and other countries the winning hand in 5G and many other areas of semiconductors. Lucy Koh should be branded a traitor. To use the word monopoly in this case is absurd, there are over 200 Semiconductor companies in the World; this is no monopoly. The case back years ago against Microsoft, had way more merit and they won their case for being the “De-facto” dominate PC operating system of the whole world. Please US Attorney General fast track this appeal to the Supreme Court ASAP!!"

VOTE BLUE !!!!!
"Initial buy in was in July 2020 ... was bored and looking for something that might have some decent upside!! Well I was wrong, QCOM had great upside potential! Bought in again the last 2X QCOM came out with ""bad news"" ... last ER analyst were ""disappointed"" not me, bought more at 146; AAPL came out with their own manufacturing plans BUT the so called ""experts"" ignored the FACT that AAPL still has a 6 year contract with QCOM which will just add to QCOM's bottom line. Got in at 144! Target exit is 167 - 170. Just hold one as QCOM is the premier 5G chip manufacturer. Sure there may be some supply issues but who else is gonna sell the BEST 5G chip!!!"
"Breaking News - QCOM fires CEO, appoints 6 new independent directors. A headline like this would cause a 20% pop in the pps. But this BOD will never do it - it takes away their gravy train."

QC weak Managment.... past 5 years they have not followed other chip suppliers. Compare them to Broadcom and others.... Amon is a child and needs to go...
Apple is reporting after close; with recent carrier promos iPhone12 is red hot and the expensive versions Pro/ProMax selling out. Main chip suppliers likely to fly - no bigger supplier than Q. Add FTC defeat and Q is going to see 140s next week.

Nothing has changed with the minor league take_under attempt. A reasonable opening bid from a minor league company like Broadcom is $110/share plus 1/2 share of Broadcom for every share share of Qualcomm.
"I get thumbs down for saying it’s underperforming again, like yesterday. The stock is a  still, and short term, I expect it to come back some more. I’m not a bear, just think the stock is still garbage in its performance. I don’t see how people don’t see this on this board. Massively underperforming today against other peers"
Close above 140. Then 145 EOW.

"Will be key to see MUs ER tomorrow and what is said about supply constraint. This will be a harbinger of things to come for QCOM and expectations. I sense that supply constraints have been talked about less lately and last couple comments out of QCOM management have been encouraging. The single biggest positive thing that can happen for QCOM pps is for someone to say they are seeing improvements and expect chip shortage to abate. The reason is QCOM has said countless times - the ONLY thing holding them back is supply, the demand is there. Once QCOM can meet demand with supply, this bear story is over in a big way."

"JPMorgan prefers shares of Qualcomm over Apple JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee currently prefers Qualcomm (QCOM) over Apple (AAPL), even as he rates both stocks Overweight for the long term. iPhone build revisions in seasonally lower quarters and the likely discontinuation of iPhone 12 mini will increase concerns on the sustainability of 5G iPhone volume expectations, Chatterjee tells investors in a research note. For Qualcomm, the analyst continues to see catalysts, ""although less modest than prior,"" from broader 5G adoption and increasing 5G mix in 2021 along with ""resilient"" second half of 2021 earnings from the combination of pricing and reduction of supply constraints."
Looks like PJ is off the board after March 23rd. That would clear the way for him to attempt a private take over. Can't be on the board if you're going to attempt a buyout.
I guess Taiwan semiconductor is making chips for media tech which will give qcom some competition. anyone know more about this competition for qcom?
All the technical indicators say it's strong bullish both short term and long term. Go Qualcomm!
This should go up but it is not why why why
T minus 10 days til QCOM minus $2 billion
"As of Friday’s close, Qualcomm stock is only up 0.8% since its last earnings report in early November. In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX has gained 4.8%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP has grown 8.8%, and the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX has increased 4.3% in that time."

"This whole time you were thinking 5G was for you, right? I hate to be the one to break it to you, but it’s not. 5G isn’t for humans. 5G is for machines. Motors, gears, CPUs, GPUs, actuators and sensors: these are the familiar components that make up the modern machine. However, most machines have lived a life of solitude. We've taken our devices and machines for granted by reserving the Internet for our use only without realizing how much better our lives would be if machines could connect to us as well as to each other more effectively. Enter 5G. As Neil Armstrong said it was for Mankind, so is 5G. This quote goes back to JR Simplot he helped to bank roll founding brothers of Micron Tech.He said you know these computers, their going to be bigger than the D__ __ n wheel, and 5G will be bigger than the Wheel also!!As a retired Engineer I can see just how important 5G is. 5G Is for Cars, 5G Is for Factories, 5G Is for Agriculture, 5G Is for Medicine, 5G Is Now. We believe in a connected world that leverages all aspects of 5G and beyond, that is way QCOM 5G modem chips from QCOM will be the best choice; they will protect the USA and keep it secure from China and other dangerous countries.PS - Greg I did read you article you posted.. a good one."
Several analysts upgraded the price target as well as ratings on Qualcomm stock after the company settled the dispute with Apple. Analysts like Evercore ISI upgraded their rating on Qualcomm to “outperform” and price target to $90. J.P. Morgan has also upgraded the rating to “overweight” from “neutral” on April 17. Price target upgrades are as follows:Raymond James: $85 from $65Susquehanna: $95 from $65Rosenblatt Securities: $84 from $70Mizuho: $82 from $62J.P. Morgan: $88 from $54Cowen and Company: $91 from $70Canaccord Genuity: $89 from $75
So apple is working on it's own 5G technology. If every chip maker works for it's own 5G what is going to happen to QCOM.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-deleted-revealing-job-listing-211315221.html
"QCOM has trailing EPS of 5.20 based on approximately 10% of all phones sold in 2020 being 5G (or 130 million units). Now given there are 1.3 billion phones sold every year it’s easy to assume that this year 5G unit sales will conservatively be in the 250-350 million unit range and then next year in the 600-800 million unit range. TBH, next year will probably be higher and closer to 1 billion units because sooner rather than later no one will want a 4G phone at any price. So I don’t know what share of 5G revenues QCOM will capture but I do know unit revenues from 5G sales of QCOM licenses or products will range anywhere from 1.5-10X 4G. With that I think I can safely say QCOM will beat the living snot out of the 8.08 $/share estimate analysts have on the books for 2021. And that’s without even mentioning the growth associate with non cell phone 5G markets.....HOLY MOLY."
"Look guys ask yourself if the stock fell back to $110 or below, how much more would you buy? Probably a lot. That’s why this stock is headed a lot higher. The Huawei settlement and victory over the FTC caught many hedge funds off guard and underinvested, so they’ll want to own the stock on any pullback. Stay invested and be aware of MMs trying to manipulate you out of your shares."

"does this market want an nxpi deal or not? nxpi getting hit today because of heightened concerns on trade negotiations w/ china, and the (un)related decision by mofcom. but if the mood is heightened concern, why isn't qcom getting hit similarly? i've also noticed the opposite too....that when nxpi goes higher resulting from upbeat mood on trade talks, qcom doesn't follow suit. that would leave one to believe that no outcome on the nxpi deal will move the needle much. that would leave apple and their own performance as the near term catalysts. thoughts?"

"Let’s talk about iPhone 13. Is this the end of Skyworks as RF front end gets consolidated into the Modem? Qualcomm Announces Next-Generation 5G RF Front End Solutions, Featuring Use of Artificial Intelligence for Sleeker, High Performance 10 Gigabit 5G DevicesWhat’s New: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. today announced its next generation of Qualcomm RF Front End (RFFE) solutions for high-performance 5G mobile devices. The solutions are designed to support advanced performance and power-efficiency capabilities in the newly announced Qualcomm Snapdragon X65 and X62 5G Modem-RF Systems – bringing together modem, RF transceiver, RF front-end components with artificial intelligence (AI) assistance and mmWave antenna modules to enable OEMs to design premium 5G devices.And from another article...Qualcomm today announced its X65 modem, the 4G/5G component that will connect 2022's phones to carrier networks. The new modem allows for ""10 gigabit"" 5G connectivity, by expanding the number of 5G channels it can use at once. But there's a lot more going on here, which could further transform how we use 5G.Qualcomm's modems are used in nearly every high-end phone in the US, including those from Samsung and Apple. Apple inked a ""multiyear"" deal with Qualcomm in 2019, to cover at least the iPhone 12, 13, and 14 models, after which it may (or may not) start using modems it develops itself.The new modem will appear in phones in ""late 2021,"" according to Qualcomm. That means it has a chance of appearing in the iPhone 13. That would be a swerve for Apple, as it would mean skipping a generation of modems. The current iPhones have Qualcomm's X55, and this would mean they skip the X60. But Apple may also be the only Qualcomm smartphone customer that could pull this trick off, as only Apple buys discrete modems from Qualcomm. Other manufacturers wait for the modems to be integrated into Qualcomm's overall Snapdragon chipsets, which takes a few more months."
My dream is to see qcom cross 87 so I could sell some. I own too many shares of this company

"Do NOT be buying call options into this earnings. The report will be a nothing burger in general. Although the outlook over the next year is great, you saw how TSM and INTC reacted. A nice 5-7% correction coming in May in which you can buy this piece of  at $127.95 the closest gap down it needs to fill. This is a bad stock so far this year against other semi peers, market doesn’t like Qualcomm and quite frankly hasn’t for the past 12 years. It’s been a disaster in that timeframe"

Qualcomm’s appeal has not been confirmed and is pending."
QCOM flipping the bird at Hock Tan and Apple.Its a win win as either Uncle Hock raises the bid orQCOM drops in which we can buy more and collect the 4-5% dividend and then eventually one day QCOM goes back to 80+ on its own.

Do you guys think current BoD wants to negotiate price now before the new pro-avgo Bod come in and force a deal with lower share price or low exit compensation for execs ? since time was running out qcom decided to get CIFUS involved to buy time. CIFUS usually gets involved when a deal has been agreed which it hasn't in this case.

"A reason to own Qualcomm !smartphone manufacturers have only one company they can choose to obtain a needed 5G chipset -- Qualcomm.Despite this situation, both the government and Qualcomm's competitors have failed to label Qualcomm a monopolist in a legal sense.In the end, Apple's settled its lawsuits, and Qualcomm persuaded the courts to overturn a previous monopoly decision. This is because customers and even regulators want 5G chips more strongly than they wish to curtail Qualcomm's market power.Still, although Apple settled in court, it also bought Intel's smartphone chipset business. This could someday give Qualcomm a competitor. However, unless and until that day comes, all of the benefits of 5G chipset growth will accrue to Qualcomm."

"Qcom better shows more than excellent numbers, the stock will tank otherwise!!!!"
Company is leader in connectivity. Autos and AI machines will need QCOMS expertise. Chip stocks and QCOM in particular will take share as 5G comes on line.The phones computer power still needs improvement too. QCOM is a better tech company than Intel. Apple will lose share and won't be in any ones eye sight.Auto industry in China and Europe will lead in the conversion to electric cars. Battry prices are dropping. QCOM will do find with improving the automoble and transportation in general.
"Actual 1) Settlement w/ Apple 2) Settlement w/ LG 3) Stay of the Koh ruling. Yes, the Koh ruling itself was within the timeframe of events above, but if you look at that as an anomaly and assume it will be overturned (you don't have to, but it's one reasonable assumption), then it sure feels like there is some momo building. A trade deal or a trade deal light and there is no reason that w/ 5g coming, this shouldn't be a hundy."
"Wether my vote means much or not doesn’t matter to me. I’m voting with qcom. I’ll ride this out with the dividend for as long as possible. Somehow getting $60 and Broadcom shares doesn’t interest me at all. I mean let’s face it, these guys wanted qcom to buy them but qcom didn’t want them. I mean if they don’t want themselves, why do I want them. Just like qcom, I wanted no shares of broadcom either."

"@FTC, better luck next crime"
No need to sell anymore as the biggest risk is gone! Congratulations on long term investors! This is just beginning.
Watched this stock fall from the $160's to @ $145 range and bought in. Despite the continued drop I still feel good about this position.
"i don't know how many of you realize , QCOM would not be spending all rhis money on buying back stock unless they were so confident in all the money they are going to be making with 5G and all. Think about it, it is going to be boom time for them over the next 5 years."
BofA Securities analyst Tal Liani raised the price target on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) to $180.00 (from $165.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.
In todays market of inflated PEs. A 24 on qcom looks cheap.
"Don't know how to react to this man. I got into this stock just 3 weeks ago in a huge way. i just didn't understand why it was so low so I took a 3rd of my 401 (500K) and bought the stock at 91.35. Never however did I expect this type of earnings and future guidance. And now I feel this is only the beginning. Hopefully, management has a solid plan of growth going forward, both in development of new chips and solid license agreements. If they do then in a couple of years they will have a market cap of over 400 billion."
qcom should take advantage and do a massive buy back to give shareholders confidence and to raise avgo price.
"Based on Doji Hammer Friday. If we close green Monday then we may see 145 by Friday. If we close red, then pain continues."
Dividend yield still over 3%. Should give you perspective on how QCOM is still undervalued even with the settlement news spiking the stock. Buy.
"Qcom is ready to breakout to upside .. the next Year looks much better than last year .. when Apple starts shipping new 5 G phonecurrent levels, Qualcomm trades at a forward P/E ratio of around 22.2. This comes in much higher than the average forward multiple for the last five years of about 14.7.Admittedly, this year's expected earnings increase of 5.6% may not impress prospective stockholders. However, investors should also remember that last year, the company resolved the lawsuit with Apple that had held this stock down for years. Moreover, analysts expect profit growth to take off once 5G becomes more widely adopted. They predict that earnings will increase 55.9% next year and average almost 25.7% per year for the next five years.Moreover, even if COVID-19 delays 5G adoption for a time, investors can still earn a return. Qualcomm's annual dividend of $2.60 per share yields about 3.3%. The company has also hiked this payout periodically since it began paying dividends in 2003."
evercore has quite a reduction price target for qcom cut from $190 down to $150? ouch
"Just a though, here... Why is everybody so confident, that China cannot do anything about Huawei?? Chinese do think always for the long term. For example, they just filed a PATENT on a Covid vaccine production (not sure if process or technique). What if (as everybody seems to want them to) they are FORCED to follow all patent rules worldwide, and suddenly nobody can produce vaccines (or they can, at a high royalty)?Everything looks positive for QCOM and 5G now. But trouble can come now from anywhere. Politics are far more complicated than chips..."

"5G is the next thing. Actually AAPL may be a little shielded for now, but they have to depend on QCOM millimeterwave chips. INTC is at least 1 year behind. The VZW 5G devices you are going to see in October are probably Samsung or INTC based and are not known for their mobility capabilities - which means they can't go into smartphones anytime soon. Only QCOM and probably Huawei have that tech, but you know you (and the rest of the world) can trust only one between QCOM and Huawei."

"From Barrons the best 5G play! Head-line Buy Qualcomm!! Gerra sees Qualcomm as the most obvious bet on the expansion of 5G wireless networks and devices in 2021 and beyond. Stick that in your pipe and smoke Apple!!!Qualcomm shares are getting a boost Wednesday from Baird analyst Tristan Gerra, who picked up coverage of the mobile-phone chip company with an Outperform rating and a Street-high $200 price target. The bottom line is that Gerra sees Qualcomm as the most obvious bet on the expansion of 5G wireless networks and devices in 2021 and beyond.“Qualcomm is at the center of the unfolding 5G secular cycle, eventually expanding from smartphones to many end markets,” including automotive applications and the internet of things, he writes. He also notes that the company’s ARM-based Snapdragon microprocessors“are on the cusp of mass adoption in notebooks.” Longer term, he adds, Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) is “well-positioned to leverage its technology into AI [artificial intelligence] applications notably in automotive and consumer.”"
"once upon a time Qcom produced chips, modems, connectivity and paid almost the ENTIRE cost of R&D for what we enjoy today in the firm of smartphones, flip phones etc. apple woke up one day and said to themselves, ""Hey Qcom is helping our competition and Android is no longer a small player. let's destroy Qcom"". it doesn't get anymore ANTI-COMPETITIVE than that....where is the ftc, the wto, the EU, China, S.korea? where??? they're at the bank depositing apple revenue. that my friends is why this BS has dragged on as long as it has. now that apple demand is dwindling I would expect some accurate depictions of ANTI-COMPETITIVE litigation. this should really becine one if the points to use in the battle, perception is half the game. let this be heard that apples anti competition is the reasin why they are at war with Qcom not the savings per unit. they build it into their outrageous price already and the sheep have flocked fir years...."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"In Feb 1994, QCOM pps was 35 when estimated for FYE Sept 1994 were $0.90 nonGAAP Forward PE 39. At this time, pps is 130 and the FYE Sept 2021 estimates are $7.30 nonGAAP, Forward PE <20. Discounted for prevailing interest rates, QCOM is much less expensive now compared to 27 years ago."
"One more thought on the Apple modem: they may be afraid that Q will stop offering its best as discrete solution in the future. With 888 Q has achieved premium processor/modem integration - this is the future; Apple is wedded to its A-processor line and so needs to get discrete modems which will hurt it compared to the competition using integrated Q solution. Q may well stop offering discrete modems in the future, so A is forced into own modem development where it may or may not succeed - i.e. why did Intel fail at 5G after massive spending and Apple with no prior track record would succeed? Q has been at this for decades - they have massive resources and IP. In fact Q resources in cellular IP are far greater than Apple's. So this may also be a forced move by Apple not to be left behind."
never listen to JIM..do ur own analysis
Man I wished we could put Zack’s articles on mute. Completely worthless IMO
Will QCOM cross $65 if the proposed acquisition is successful?

Qualcomm earnings call replay https://youtu.be/J8Qg0glaC24
"Rosenblatt Securities Believes Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) Still Has Room to Grow (via SmarterAnalyst)""In a report released today, Jun Zhang from Rosenblatt Securities maintained a Buy rating on Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), with a price target of $84. The company’s shares closed yesterday at $86.37, close to its 52-week high of $88.63.""“We think Qualcomm will continue to see weakness from the Android market in the second half of this year due to our belief that there will be an inventory correction in the Android market in late C3Q and C4Q. However, we see several catalysts for QCOM in 2H19 as many Chinese OEMs plan to launch their 5G smartphones in China in late C3Q (albeit at small volumes). In addition, we believe Apple (AAPL: Neutral) will begin to use Qualcomm modems again starting in the second half of this year. We maintain our Buy rating and $84 price target. We believe Chinese OEMs, as well as Samsung (SSNLF: NR), will become more aggressive when launching their 5G smartphones in mid-2020. We see Apple launching their regional 5G iPhone in the second half of 2020.”"
hopefully qcom guided conservatively relative to explosion which will occur when chips production can keep up with demand. then the real blow out #s will propel to $400 range
"only correct things happens even after while.. QCOM is hard worker brain powerhouse, it will win alwayse in the end because real things alwayse overtake smoke and mirrors"
QCOM now sees FY2019 EPS at $4.47-$5.22. Using a p/e of 15 gives a fair share price next year of $67-$78.

The analyst sees the real ""main event"" risk with the company's upcoming trial this month in a dispute with Apple (AAPL), which has alleged that Qualcomm's licensing model is illegal. Kelleher contends however that Qualcomm's licensing model has ""repeatedly been validated"" and the company has ""withstood multiple legal challenges over the past two decades""."

"Qualcomm valuation is way too low - it resembles PE of TI (35) but with growth prospects of AVGO, NVDA and AMD or better. If have same PE as above peers it should be $330 stock. And don't see how AVGO has better growth prospects. If Q delivers earns blowout - and it looks like this will happen - watch out for 200s easy."

"My argument for AVGO merger is that post Dr.Jacobs, Q has been showing consistently pathetic stock performance. In 2000, price stabilized around 40 (discounting dot com blip to 88). Today's real value is in mid fifties (I would attribute another 10 point jump to current 65 to AVGO). Why would one believe in Q mgmt when they say they have solid plans to grow business leaps and bounds going forward as an independent company when their past performance over 17 years returned just a meagre 2.2% (not even cumulative and I was so generous not taking all time high of 88 into account) returns every year since 2000. It doesn't even look like breadcrumbs compared to rest of the industry. So, blue looks attractive even @ 82. Yes, I would believe in white provided they do a major top mgmt/board reorg and bring in somebody new like Microsoft CEO who is capable of teaching a old dog some new tricks before March 6th meeting."
QCOM will fizzle after Q1-21 ER !!!
"If Apple is a Trillion $$$ company - then qcom will be a 1/4 trillion $$$ company. So qcom goes up to 240 and that means it will ""ramp up"" to 267. NVDA had a similar run-up to what I described. This is a no-brainer. Since Apple has teamed up with QCOM it is impossible to stop QCOM."

the BROADcom offer was $82 bucks a share and that was while this litigation was very active.. This is worth well over 100$ also remember the Jacobs family wanted to take this private...

Please pay attention to the whole thread in the future"
"I’m not surprised at all in the minor appreciation of Qualcomm. If you look at the landscape, it appears the overall market is somewhat tired. I just say it based on all these big companies reporting and not much movement. I expect the market to trade sideways to down 4% over the next month. I’m referring to the S&P which is at an RSI of 68, almost in the overbought territory. The S&P is up 12% so far this year. It’s not sustainable to be up seemingly every week during the first four months of the year. On the other hand, the Nasdaq is up 9% so far this year and not overbought. Perhaps the Nasdaq pulls back 2-3% over the next few weeks as well. I still believe QCOM reaches $190-200 by very end of year, just saying you can tell by price action stocks are temporarily going to take a breather, especially with the big earnings now behind us."
Woww. Plus a 3 percent dividend. Don’t forget Broadcom attempted to buy out Qualcomm. Which was rejected for security reasons. This baby is going to 100

"OK here is an addendum from the article that shows the hypocrisy of those customers complaining about the licensing fees in industries that are making a fortune from QCOM's innovations. According to Rogers, what these critics ignore is the actual value of the underlying essential technology and IP that Qualcomm provides. This point was further illustrated by some numbers Rogers shared: the value of cumulative SEP licensing royalties was less than $10B worldwide in the year 2019. Meanwhile, in the same year, mobile device, operators, and infrastructure equipment brought in over $1 trillion in revenue. Considering how much of Qualcomm IP was integral to the development of these solutions, I would say OEM’s are making off with a pretty good deal."

""We are helping as much as we can,"" she said. • Foxconn, another Taiwanese company, also is trying to calm nerves.

""Since most of the customers we serve are large customers, they all have proper precautionary planning,"" he said. • A labor leader for Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) reportedly said the German automaker's biggest plant, in Wolfsburg, is facing shortages of semiconductors and also battery cells.

Their PE was in mid-20s before they turned around - any of this sound familiar? I am sure many were shook out of the stock - but of course NVIDIA was a growth company and deserved a higher valuation than mid-20s. Nvidia now trading (2 years later) above 600 (6X increase). This is so similar to QCOM it is silly - note that both NVIDIA and QCOM prior to the unwarranted punishment had a 1 year triple in share price prior. So moral of this story is to hang tight with QCOM - best way to understand the future is to learn the history."

I don’t see anybody who can bridge this gap,” this person said…[Steve] Mollenkopf, who was born in Baltimore, is a military buff who interned for the Central Intelligence Agency before joining Qualcomm. He has often made decisions after consulting individually with his top lieutenants, but many have left over the years, leaving him isolated and reliant on counsel from outside advisers.[Tim] Cook, an Alabama native, is an operations whiz who works to build consensus among Apple’s top-dozen leaders, often asking them, “What is the right thing to do?” The group-decision approach has resulted in a team of enforcers who defend Mr. Cook’s view that Qualcomm’s licensing practices—taking a 5% share of most of the sales price of an iPhone—was just plain wrong, allowing the chip maker to profit off Apple innovations in display and camera technology…A jury could determine who is the real victim: Qualcomm, which claims Apple is violating its patents by withholding royalties, or Apple, which argues Qualcomm has been overcharging for those patents for years. At stake is the future of Qualcomm’s licensing model and billions of dollars in royalties that Apple will pay or keep."
"Global shipments of 5G-enabled smartphones are expected to reach over 250 million units in 2020, accounting for over 20% of global smartphone shipments for the year, according to Digitimes Research's latest estimation.Digitimes Research also maintains its April forecast that global smartphone shipments for 2020 will contract 15.2% to 1.15 billion units as global economic activities remain weak amid the lingering impacts of the pandemic.Shipments of 5G phones in the China market alone will total 170 million units in 2020 as Chinese handset vendors have been keen on rolling out entry-level and mid-tier 5G models to spur replacement demand in the local market.5G models will account for 52.7% of total smartphones shipped to China in 2020 and two-thirds of the total 5G phone shipments shipped worldwide in the year, Digitimes Research's figures show.Bolstered by stronger-than-expected 5G phone sales, China's smartphone shipments are likely to stay flat or fall slightly in second-half 2020 as compared to a year earlier, finishing out the year with a 10.3% decline in its smartphone shipments.5G phone shipments outside China will reach only 82.3 million units or below 10% of global smartphone shipments in 2020 as the rollouts of 5G networks in most other parts of the world have been delayed by the pandemic.Overall smartphone shipments outside China also took a hit from the virus experiencing a 25.9% on-year decline in second-quarter 2020 and are expected to come out the year with an on-year decline of 17.1%."

"After today will this be the last dividends for a while? It seems to me that regardless of who is sitting on the board that dividends will be suspended for at least a few quarters, although I don't really know and I'm not familiar with dividend protocol. If Q's board is retained, I don't see how they can pay next quarter's divys because Q's shareholders will have to forego the next divy to pay the $17.50 premium ($127.50 vs. $110) to obtain NXPI. In other words we transferred our divy to the S/H of NXPI. Even if it works out in the long run the immediate impact it seems to me is that we want see a payment for a while after next month. If an AVGO submitted board replaces Q's I don't see them declaring a dividend until the acquisition is complete and is a part of AVGO. Even if Q had not acquired NXPI they would strapped for cash just to pay the original $70 ($60 cash) and that assumes they would have gotten Q's pre NXPI cash boat load. Even at $79 and certainly not at $90 will AVGO entertain any thoughts of paying a dividend. It seems it may be a while before we get a dividend again?"

Qualcomm (QCOM) PT Raised to $190 at Raymond James
To be honest people who knew a little about the Qualcomm history in these similar court cases back decade ago with Nokia and knew about the related laws and the contract obligations should have known Apple will make the deal if Qualcomm can stand the pressure. And apple played this the best they could by putting a lot of pressure via the government trade commissions around the world and even encouraging Broadcom to buy Qcom. Apple's game has always been to make Qualcomm to buckle under pressure and give in and they came very close to succeeding. But as far a their argument having any merits in the court of law-- they had little chance to win the April case and they always knew that.

"shares traded as high as $90.46 yesterday before retreating. I am encouraged by the fact that 86% of shares are owned by institutions (all 1800+ of them). Importantly, the largest positions are held by the largest institutions on the street. Unlike mutual funds, institutional investments are house money...vested for growth and income. 5G is also garnering larger positions for specialized and general communications ETFs. 5G is not happening on a large scale domestically or globally tomorrow, but the interest in it and build up of it does garner serious interest and is all good for QCOM."

"QCOM will start to surge next year as global market share for IOT is increasing 5 times til 2024 from 2017. They produced 1/5 of revenue last FY and expect 120% increase this FY.

AVGO and Hock Tan will win on Tuesday. They will then enter into a definitive merger agreement with QCOM for $82 a share. They will also announce a big strategic partnership and investment in NXPI instead of an outright buyout. All three stocks will be massive gainers for the rest of the year. JMHO.
Good news - Chip Shortage Spirals Beyond Cars to Phones and Game Consoles! QCOM and TWST will rise from here guys!
Low volume so I doubt this sell off is by those that are in the know. However it is a little unsettling isn't it? GOOG was up 30 points before they reported yesterday
Who the hell is selling at this price and WHY??????
We will see Wednesday. Blowout. Get ready for liftoff
wait for good news to come...forecast also will be stellar...don will be forever hidden for atleast next 2-3 yrs

Almost passed its index on that BUY run!
Just a little “profit taking” boys as market makers take out tight stops prior to next move up.
Shocking FTC testimony’s this weekQualcomm is definitely being exposed as the extortion racketeers they areStock price reflects nervousness about what the testimony is exposing
I can't take it anymore.

Going to close the gap...no doubt.

No bag holders here! I bought in at $88 on Friday- if it drops I will cost average down. What a great company !!!
Still way overpriced
They are shorting this
if I own it (which I do) it's going down. Guaranteed.
You’s all in at $167+? $130 gap up needs filling! QCUM R.I.P.
"1) Reject $82/share 2) Fail in NXP bid 3) Lose billions in international court rulings over various jurisdictions 4) Produce no shareholder value in five years 5) Take a legal position that could potentially result in substantial losses and upending of business model, or at best, win here / lose there and have legal battles drag out for the foreseeable future. Explain to me where there is demonstrative interest shown in shareholder value. Please. It's bizarro to me that other than the shareholder vote, there is no natural mechanism to rectify this. What a @#$# I am for not selling."
Kevin the legend is that you? And we agree to not buy until the gap around $130 is filled. I never short a stock but I will be waiting for you and will load the boat if/when it ever gets there. Drive it down to me you old shorty shorter in your short pants....
may see $153-$155 on this volatility guys!Volatility is the $$$$...

Quit blaming Apple or the FTC lawsuit for QCOM's poor performance. Look at management who said QCOM was undervalued at $82. Stock is now under $50 but they're still reaping big salary bucks for poor decisions.
Would be interesting to see what QC will get from Apple.... did they win a 5g socket or will Apple do an in-house design w Intel scrap sale? Have not heard much..... any one have info?

"It is real cheap stock if you want to buy and hold for a few years. I don't see any competitor in mobile chipset sector. INTC already say BYE-BYE. QCOM has 6 years contract with AAPL, and AAPL needs QCOM really bad, in order to slow down the I-Phone sales slow down. Let me tell you one thing, this quarter, not smart phone is slow down, but I-Pad too. SamSung tablet is half price of I-Pad. AAPL will need revenue from service in a hurry, otherwise, AAPL will hit the wall this quarter."

"If AAPL loses the lawsuits, will AAPL then say, ""You were right, we're sorry, and we're going to buy everything from you in the future""? I don't see a ""win"" here fro QCOM in court.

"Can you believe managements testimony in the FTC trial ? Mollenkopf said he wasn't aware of q halting chips, but q halted shipments to Sony, and threatened to halt shipments to Huawei, Samsung and others. Amon said he wasn't aware of cutoffs, yet approved 2 himself. Another exec said he didn't recall an IRS meeting, until they played it back on tape.Think its funny. Think again. Why would you believe anything they say, including rev and earning predictions.Even Jacobs made dubious statements during the trial. When I see what these people testified, and actually did, maybe socialism is a good thing, to get these lying execs out of their jobs. Especially when they reaped bonuses for signing apple. Don't think that deal will stand as is. When they look everything over, and come up with fair rates, Q will be half the size it is now. And not only will they reimburse customers, they will probably have to make compensory and punitive payments to the competition they hurt."

Just a pure manipulation by analysts.
Remember this management team is full of geniuses who told us all that $82/share severely undervalues the company. They should all go to jail.
It's heading to 120 or lower.
I m keeping my sell call @120.

"wow, I guess I was wrong to doubt ? but I'll take this gain !!!"
7% off left everyone scratching your heads? Its just wallstreet being wallstreet. It will probably fall 12% and by middle of next week it will 165.
That’s it 4 dollar rise come on. Now there is no issue hindering qcom going forward.
Another painful day 
last time it was told $82 was too low and it should be at least $90 I hope it goes above that price

Weak stock
QCOM: may close 95$ today 100$ tomorrow after INTC earning
QCOM will be using all it's cash reserves and go into net debt after NXP is acquired. With a weaken position - does it not makes things easier for Broadcom to make another offer?
Just buy more on bargain DIP..

WOO HOO ---Qualcomm Gets Apple’s Patent Claims Dismissed from Contract Case - Bloomberg News
It looks like Q is positioning its financials for the possibility of a loss of the San Diego court case to the CMs—a $9B or enhanced $27B judgement for the CMs would be difficult if not impossible for Q to pay off and could force Q into bankruptcy so as to avoid the payment. GD is a clever fellow.

I think Qcom board has gotten the message.i expect them to increase the div and will aggressively do stock buy back.5G it's going to make us money.avgo needs Qcom.qcom share are worth between 110 to 120 with the new NXP deal.AVGO is not and does not want to pay for it's foward value.AVGO deal is a sucker's deal.
Told everyone 100x gap @ 130 has to be filled

Blowout earnings next week. u heard it here firsthand. i got a peek at the company release. next feb ftc courtcase to be over turned too.
Sound like US government supports Qualcomm license business so FTC may have to drop the suit. apple has to settle soon
I sold all my long long term position at 57. I believe fight with apple is huge mistake. IMO within 5 years or so Qualcomm will be pushed out of Asia by Samsung Huawei and they break the relation in western world with apple and other customers will be also careful with such acting. Big mistake. I sold.
"Oh man!!! $80 was broadcomm offer without this 6 years license agreement with Apple, and also before the $30 billion buyback so there was a lot less shares...Also Qcom signed deals with 30 companies for 5g chips supply...This is easy an $120 stock"
Buy Buy Buy! iPhone and galaxy need Qualcomm chips you think they will go down in sales because chips shortage ?!!! They will find a way Qualcomm have 14 buy analysis with 0 sell !!!
New ceo is doing a great job. Navigating through this.

There is no reason why it wont reach $100+Apple’s big deal is the answer!

All clear ahead. Now we can buy with conviction.

Steve Mollenkompt is going to lead this company through one of the greatest attacks on a corporation in the history of American.

"I was skimming through some apple forums such as insiderapple.com, it amazes me how many brain washed fan boys are still in denial. They were utterly disgusted that QCOM or anyone dares to charge a $7.50 license fee on their $1k+ darling. They were completely convinced that this was an Apple victory and that QCOM bent to their pressure and reduced the 5G royalty rate and beg to get back in the Apple camp. I guess the same can be said of the political fanatics, where all normal objective reasoning and analytics goes out the window."

The trend is up now guys and yesterday proved it....
It would seem to me that QCOM would be a much better target of an INTC acquisition if the intent was to disrupt the AVGO/QCOM transaction. AAPL's intended use of the inferior INTC chips in their phones due to the dispute with QCOM would be solved. INTC would get the benefit of QCOM's leading position in 5G and automated vehicles (post NXPI acquisition). The premium required to purchase QCOM is probably lower than required to purchase AVGO and INTC would get so much more technology. The U.S. Gov would look at them like the white knights.

As a result, the analyst expects upside to Q4 guidance and believes there could be ""substantial upside"" to estimates through the beginning of 2021 due to double ordering. He recommends investors buy any dips in the near term on the belief that chances for an inventory build are good. Danely's favorite names remain Qualcomm (QCOM), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), Lam Research (LRCX) and Marvell Technology Group (MRVL)."

What is the P E. Ratio. Undervalued to say the least
YAHOO ADMIN: PLEASE STOP THE SPAMMER!
Nut up and load up!!
Very very low volume after hours. Mostly cowboys working for hedgefunds bringing the price down. Analysts are false prophets. They estimated often very ridiculous revenues. Qualcomm reached ridicul high targets. Be glad with this company.
"Earnings were excellent,revenue was down a little.. the only sellers are the idiots"
Maybe analysts will come up with new estimates tomorrow
I bought more just before the close.
What are possibilities going forward if the ruling stands? Break up QCOM? Would that help or hurt investors? Help or hurt their technology and innovation? Other possible scenarios?
"5G holographic projection needs to be realized through the cooperation of various technologies. In this realization process, it needs the close cooperation of 5G high-speed transmission technology, VR, laser projection and other technologies."
DOW +1.97% #$%$ QCOM +1.21% WTAF???????????????????????????????
"Cracking down on GDP growth is peak “woke”, but I need to know which children’s author gets sent to the gulag next, Joe. Please hurry."
Laying off 1000 San Diego employees is a tough way to boost earnings
elon musk to put up satellites up with space x. musk envisions phones having access directly to their satellites. this better than 5g. 5g bad at going around/thru walls have to have box on every building real pain. this 6g idea more efficient and will also include qcom
Why is the price still declining? Complete and utter manipulation from wall street. The huge sell off in 4 days smells of hedge funds.
QCOM bout to breakout
Very strange decision by the full ITC review. Even Apple admitted indirectly an infringement on 949 and requested additional time to work on work around solution!!!
"Qcom could agree to deal and pray for deal to fall apart inorder to book $8 Billion termination fee, whichQcom has never made in any fiscal quarter."
EPS $6.5 x 19 P/E (standart this market) = $123 price target
This stock will go to 100$ very fast and all the short will be in misery asking some cent for buy a bread and water. Strong buy strong buy.Target price 100$ very very fast.
"Barry, you are correct! I see QCOM around $72 tomorrow. What others dont realize is the fact that patent royalties pay the divi for the next 5 years. Improvement in 5G handset cycle, Huawei agreement, Tencent agreement, Apple has no modem for at least three years....are all icinh on the cake. Management is correct in being conservative...smart move there."
Nice recovery
Apple is going pay QCOM judging from injuction from Germany and China. QCOM should futher jack up the price to punish APPLE infringement
Looks like another painful day tomo 
"QCOM management claims that AVGO's offer significantly undervalues the company. If that's true, why haven't we seen significant insider purchases over the past 2-3 years? These fat cats just want to milk the company in perpetuity via stock grants/options."
Any chance Q will have a 2019 fiscal year EPS of $5.50 to $7.25 as was forecasted about a year ago when Q was fending off the BRCM offer of $82? Not even close to the low end of the forecast? Looks like the EPS year end at around $2.80. Anybody feel deceived?
I still say for some reason this is the most hated stock. And they are still beating it up. It’s hard to believe that earnings report could take it down 20 points. Imagine if the report was bad.

everyone is asiting for 5g phone to replace their smartphones esp china..this also shows in aapl iphone sales slowdown by 17%...removing all litigations and settling with aapl for future growth is good and no competitor in NA for qcom in 5G..its for sure a lkng term BUY
QCOM traded more than 2 million shares in AH. Could be an interesting weekend and week ahead.
"Haven't heard of the latest ANALyst MizoWho??Not much reaction to their UPgrade of $60 target.See it for yourselfhttps://www.mizuhoamericas.com/insights-newsQCOM is on a budget, can't afford the GS, MS, and JPM analysts????"
"Qualcomdey , haha"
I don’t know much but I sense QCOM is going to have a blockbuster 2021 and 2022. Invest accordingly.
I feel sorry for who sold
Thought I’m getting a 10% off discount tomorrow. Now it’s only 6% off. Comon. Keep selling! I want my cheap shares.
"XIAOMI, gain mkt. share globally, especially at China, EU, and India. Huge gain notice in premium high end market. QCOM momentum appears to continue."
"I think, camel's back has finally broken. Something got to give here before we see QCOM to fall further. Would Intel go for a hostile take-over? That would be best for all parties. As for small investors, I would suggest not to buy any shares until judge speaks. The verdict will go against QCOM considering other judgements that have been rendered by Europeans, Koreans and Chinese."
150s see you at 2040
I bought three times today
"total #$%$ for QCOM to be down this much, especially with Apple blowing away earning estimates."
Qualcomdey again
Again one step forward two steps back ward what ever happens for going downnany please share thanks.
Weak stock. It is going to turn red today
"don't sell, hold and let it drop."
lol whoever is undermining this 5G top pick. This is a steal at this dip. Overreaction in my opinion
Fundamentals and common sense will prevail.
Q only gets $4.00 out this court decision WIN? Give me a break
150 this week?
Just bought for the first time. Thanks for the dip 
CNBC keeps running AAPL and QCOM tickers right next to each other. They really want a settlement so they can get 5G Iphones
Anyone here stuck above 60.00 like me?
yesssss Qualcomm confirms it will terminate NXP acquisition agreement at end of dayMARKETWATCH – 4:04 PM ET 07/25/2018
"r, who cares if it goes to $80, you’re posting as if 5G rollout isn’t even occurring. I assure you this isn’t going to dump to $65-66 like you “really think” unless markets come back 20% from here. Also, that would also include companies like Skyworks, Lumentem, Quorvo, and any other 5G suppliers. Qualcomm on the next 4 quarters forward looking PE is 18.5x while they most certainly grow 22-25x this year. Going to $65-66 like you and Don think would put this at a forward PE of 13.9x while nothing will have changed in 22-25% growth. It’s just not going to happen."

What's with the 50 sentence plus comments?
I can bet this will end in GREEN today....
The silver lining in this political war of words with China is that if indeed the US follows through significant additional capacity at TSCM will be freed up to make QCOM chips. They indicated they were worried about meeting demand in their conference call.
"Apple settled for a reason. Qualcomm won in Singapore, Japan, China Annnnnnnnd Germany.Koh has bias here and expressed her bias early to jurors. this will soon be back to $88"
"If QCOM invested in increasing their company to help grow along with the demand, I think this would jump quick."
If this fills the chart gap back 11/04 - 11/05 around $130.00 then step in and buy
This is ridiculous
"I calculated the forward PEG ratios for AMD NFLX NVDA QCOM based on the estimates for forward 12 month nonGAAP earnings, the rate of growth of those earnings and the current share price:AMD 0.83NFLX 0.85NVDA 0.79QCOM 0.31The market is supposed to discount, but looks they overdid it with QCOM, in particular after the big beat by ERIC last week."
Most of the big tech earnings are out so I expect the QCOM to drop further from here. No more element of surprise or upside for next 3 months.
"No one knows, but if you fall, tell me how far you're going to go, how far you're going to go.Also, please let me know how long it will take for Qualcomm to recover to its highest price.Thanks."
Qualcomm lost its case against Apple in Germany. This is a major setback from Qualcomm. I doubt the stock can hold above $60 http://www.fosspatents.com/2018/10/munich-i-regional-court-throws-out.html?m=1
This $70 ceiling is proving resilient

"Notice that QCOM management won't clearly state the pps value it's going to take to get the deal done. That's because if the deal doesn't go through, management will be held accountable to achieving that number within the next 1-2 years. They are in a bind and desperate to figure out a way to keep those cushy jobs."
"I’m not going anywhere, staying long on Qualcomm.. and Hello from San Diego "
CNBC spoofing this stock price and these are all bots if anyone was confused
Target $300 now
"This routine of one day up, two days down has been going on for a month now"
CEO. Start talking.
"QCOM just saved 6 billion by not having to overpay for NXPI above original offer, their eps will increase by a greater amount due to share buyback than accretion from NXPI. NXPI still a decent investment stand alone."
Great opportunity to buy on this dip. Then price will inch upward into $160s again soon.
Thanks for nothing CNBC

Chart says buy right here...
Sold everything as the price is still high over last year.
"sweet, sweet Q shares of mine :))"
"I have been holding QCOM since 1999. I will not give em 1 single share. Let them sell. They don’t belong here. They should go to Intel, that’s where they belong."
Best of luck to all QCOM longs! This is a great company with great returns coming in the years ahead. Buy this stock on the dips.
5G is Unstoppable!https://twitter.com/garyexplains/status/1201941075298050048

"man, so many posters here with long names.....weird."
buy at $110 fair price. very great company. new 5g era.
"I would like to know Qcom's plan when the big boys eliminate their chips as they develope from within. as far as the end of android, well Samsung will have to front the R&D if Qcom is gone. did someone tell them that's very expensive and some bad guys will steal their technology? but really what is the future? everyone is gearing towards cars,del driving, etc etc. I want to know. otherwise if avgo offers 2 shares for every 1 share we might have to listen...."
A fantastic buy at 20.00
"without a doubt, 90 today..... watch"
They beat earnings without Apple. Now they have apple
Looks like Qcom should have taken the merger deal with Bcom ad Hock.

Good day today! More to come tomorrow!
i am thinking more of 5g than i am with China trade........i will sell the shares i just bought much higher and can wait!! :)
"don't sell, it's going back up"
"I am confused. Is not NXP already operating in China? If so, then substituting QCOm for the NXP name changes nothing. So why the problem? If not then, why does QCOM need to get China's OK. Just dont operate in China."
+100 shares for every $5 drop
Is now a good time to buy?
Under $130 is a clear buy. QCOM is a beast of a company.
Price targets raised across the board. Easy buy.
Great buying opportunity tomorrowLong time holderBuy Buy Buy
QCOM leader in hot space of 5G. My estimation- $177 - $180 after earning

Talk about paper hands. Good riddance with you if you are selling at this price
"With the rapid popularization of 5G technology since this year, the selection of AR/VR application scenarios has been further broadened, which will undoubtedly facilitate the development of relevant technologies and markets. $WIMI"
Upgrades are ahead. Apple products are ahead. Overturn in FTC case is ahead(if US gov make America great)

"Apple is in talks to buy or merge with broadcom , how this will affect qcom i dont know, and CFO putting out a damper on conference call about suppluy chain problems regarding the ncov virus in china and now anti trust regulators talk in court this coming thursday regarding qcom's future in 5G... it really is a good buying oppurtunity if the share price tanks."
Qcom can make better industry deals once NXPI closes & AVGO out of the picture.
Only Paper hands run with just 1 buck rise.
not > $160yet? unbelievable
I know this company here + TSM from here on out will be the plays of a lifetime. I have zero capital to buy either...
I’m buying for the long term! Adding more. Go Q!
"Huawei only exists but for the inventions of Qualcomm. Obama admin was asleep at the wheel when China forced technology transfer and lowered Qcom royalty rates under bogus anti trust claims. U.S. Gov’t wakes up and realizes the power and potential of Qualcomm’s wireless tech and its National security interests. How do you stop the proliferation of Qcom across the globe and hoard it’s inventions for yourself? You use the FTC, Anti-Trust Division, ITC and court system to destroy the company and then nationalize it for your own ambitions. The 4 players above may all be sending different smoke signals but at the end of the day are all in alignment with their ultimate goal (the same goal of the U.S Government and Donald Trump)). Nationalize 5G."
Steve from CNBC said the Citi analyst made an asinine call on QCOM today.
"QCOM is no brainer long term stock. At this price it will be tough to move up to 90s, unless earnings on May1 is exceeding from estimate, which I have confidence. It will shoot up when the company change the future estimate, and add more MOJO with AAPL."
"A step forward then two steps backward, that’s the story with this jankkkkk "
"I don't know how safe investors feel about other small cap stocks.QCOM is very profitable, growing, and safe investment compare to those stocks in the market.5G just has started and operators are installing infrastructure now.I don't understand people betting on stocks just for quick return"
Such a good buy today for QCOM and TWST - 2 of the best companies that I like and TWST recovered its losses so well and fast in the past so QCOM.
It is not a definite no. Tactics to get a face saving higher offer. Look for Broadcom to offer $65 cash plus $25 in stock. Should happen Sunday I am guessing.
Can someone please explain today's dip?
"according to wall street journalBEIJING—China’s antitrust regulator has approved Qualcomm Inc.’s joint venture with a unit of China’s state-owned Datang Telecom Technology Co. to design smartphone chipsets, people familiar with the matter said, a win for the U.S. chip maker amid escalating U.S.-China trade friction.The proposed joint venture was announced a year ago, but only this week approved by China’s antitrust regulator, the people said.The venture would be formed between Qualcomm QCOM, +4.33% and Datang’s 600198, -5.06% subsidiary Leadcore Technology Co., as well as Jianguang Asset Management Co. and Wise Road Capital, Qualcomm has said. It would compete with companies producing processors for low-cost smartphones, including China’s Spreadtrum Communications, which is owned by Tsinghua Unigroup.Check out: AMD the underdog bites back, as Intel and Qualcomm struggle in their own waysAnd see: T-Mobile and Sprint use magic words in seeking Trump approval: 5G and China"

MWC coming next week along with China NXP approval. Very bullish for qcom

A most appropriate song at this time: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bpZuAtwDfag.
"I sure hope Qcom accepts Avago’s offer, to refuse would put the boards individuals financial interests above share holders interests which would be unethical."
Living proof there is no way to make easy money in the market. It always a grind
It is time for QCOM to lose on the monopoly issue if we go by the European court decision. Why expect a different verdict?
Gift priceTomorrow buying dayI told u at the beginning of day trade to wait for earnings reportSo tomorrow is a great day to reload and the share price will go even higher that the price drop
as i had said QCOM has lots of selling pressure for some reason
"Up 2,77% and in the green in the after hours?"
"every year is the same. there are ebbs and flow in everything. to all the sky is falling people, yes things may come down but they will go up too. unless you were born in the year 2020 i think you should know this by now"
5G is still a solid 3-5 years away. it takes a lot of those small poles to be installed to give out cancer rays!
I just added my positions in QCOM MRNA IMRN this morming!
apple caved on cdma technology just like Ericsson caved 20 yrs ago this is great
Is 350 shares at 54.12 good? thanks

Wait til the buyback starts. Billions.
Who downgraded QCOM today?
With net income finalizing at an impressive and expectation-beating 5.2 billion dollars for fiscal year 2020... They have really slashed their P/E... And given guidance for even further doing so in fiscal 2021....SP gotta acclimate upward in a response...For me a QCOM is a no-brainer 
"Someone is rocking the boat, trying to make weak hands so sea sick that they sell.In 4 more days, we enter the final month of the quarter, so it won't be long now before the forward guidance has them begging us to sell.Hold tight, because nothing is going to stop 5G."
Wouldn't it be just hilarious if Qcom ends up closing near the day's highs!
We need a big Cramer pump tonight 
Seems There is no surprise today. Next week would be the start.
"Perhaps paying a smaller royalty on the modem instead of the whole phone is not Apple’s real goal. What if they really just want a license to sell billions of modern chips into the IOT, Automotive, Industrial, and healthcare space. Arguing for chip level licensing would appear to be a double bonus for them."
Go Joe
This will tank after hours today. Buy puts. ER is priced in folks.

Qualcomm Technologies is introducing three new 5G RAN platform offerings: Qualcomm Radio Unit Platform, Qualcomm Distributed Unit Platform, and Qualcomm Distributed Radio Unit Platform. The new platforms are the world’s first-announced solutions purposely-designed from the ground up to support leading mobile operators in the deployment of a new generation of converged, open and virtualized RAN (vRAN) networks.

Wow - the vast majority of the rhetoric on this board today appears to be from the anti-AVGO crowd; must be running scared as NXPI continues to fade and AVGO doing an admirable job of addressing and likely resolving the national security concerns.

Apple settled w Samsung
Yesterday I figured this’ll close around $145 today and around $138-$140 tomorrow
great company!
QCOM will go up when they release the iPhone12. I can see this stock going up to $180 by the end of the year.

"The past 5 year chart looks like a series of higher lows and lower highs. So price is certainly coiling towards a big move either ways (Upwards or downwards) soon.

"NXPI drifting lower. Is that possibly an indication that QCOM won't get the 70% tender by COB Monday? Barring a negotiated sale to AVGO, the NXPI deal falling through would be the best scenario as the AVGO bid automatically jumps back to $82. Again, best scenario is a negotiated sale somewhere between 79 and 91. Second best would be NXPI deal falling through and AVGO getting QCOM at 82. Third best is a sale at 79. Worst case scenario is not getting six new board members and stock falls to 58-60 and languishes there for years."
Has anyone priced in the impact of the potential acquisition of ARM by Nvidia and how it would affect players like Qualcomm and many others who uses ARM infrastructure in its product.
Is today EX date?
Let's party like its 1999 qcom!
We have ignition
Slo burn
The good news is after 5 days of distribution its time for a positive close even if minimal it would be welcomed! I'm looking at $64 as first level resistance. JMO
Qrvo up big after hours on the demand for 5G base stations. The crushed their earnings numbers!Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) has jumped 11.4% in very early after-hours trading after its profits topped high-end estimates with a stronger-than-expected revenue gain in Q4.Revenues of $681M with a gross margin of 48.2% led to operating income of $167M.IPD revenue hit $238M thanks to strength in 5G base station deployments
Back to where it should be
"p/e 17, yield over 2%where to add, down from high of 168"
Eps was better than expected but revs were less than expected. Getting punished. Hopefully guidance is great. If not looks like I just lost a lot of money on this call
I'll venture QCOM vistis the high 50's really soon. Mark my word!
If qcom and the other Chinese firm are the only 3 companies in 5g what will Apple do for its phone. Does intel have 5g? Or does it mean that the issues need to be resolved between Apple and qcom before then ? Any thoughts
"Is it worth buying at this level? :) I got interviewed for a job here, very nice company."
Who wouldn't buy a company running at 100% capacity
Odd high volume at the close and after hours...
This baby is money $$
This is still a good long term investment for 5G and IoT isn't it?
"If you enjoy losing money, buy QCOM."
"The real deal. SWKS beat by 50%+, ERIC is half price vs it's statement about next qtr will report $0.21. ERIC belongs at $30, QCOM much higher too."
they can buy pxlw 9 dollar and license the technology together company
All this down draft was because of the 10 year Bond going up by 1/4 percent. Some moron said this would hurt companies borrowing money. Well most of these Chips stocks have no debt to worry about or very little. Also 1/4 % who cares. Just an excuse to shake weak hands! 1/4 % give me a break. This is old left over Wall Street folk lore.
Pop to $200 tomorrow will be loto day
Cut the nonsense! This is QCOM! Go Long - Stay Long- Be Strong!
"these are the type of stocks that i have done the best in the market, ones that have very good growth but have productions issues those issues always get fixed quickly and the sales increase greatly. another company that has had this issue many times is apple"
"Everyone relax, and be smart. Just like so many other companies after earnings/forecasts that don’t overly impress, this will take 3 or 4 days to find a new low. My prediction is close near $145 tomorrow and close in the high $130’s Friday...."
As I said last week: IMOINTC may be ready for a cash buyout of QCOM
"Another round of bloodbath tomorrow, fml :-("
Y’all can thank the bozos over at $QCOM and $QRVO for this GIFT  Buying more SWKS and SELLING the other two 
$80 for open on tuesday
Beat on the top and bottom line. Looks good to me!
NVDA has AI this is why it has higher PE than QCOM ever will.
Where is this Amon tweet???
"AVGO stock has been appreciating for the past 5 years, at least. What growth opportunities could AVGO possibly has to offer. Its WiFi segment? Nope. Its wired segment? Double no. Its industrial and storage segments? Somebody please explain why this stock is going up!!"
TSLA will crash because it doesn't make money from selling car!!!
"Another HUGE market potential??? This is a market potential analysis report and as I've said before, I don't need to spend $3500.00 to have someone tell me something I already know.It indicates the key companies as... QCOM, Media-tek, Broadcom etc.GNSS Chip Market current and future demand through 2027, I didn't know our QCOM was involved in GNSS."
So I guess $145.20 is the bottom
this stock will easily double in one or two years.
get in CRNT. CRNT will take business from QCOM. CRNT earnings report coming out on feb 8th. expected 150+% growth.!!!!!
thats why i said listen to er call
overalll good..listen to earnings call before making conclusions
This is hitting 130. Wowww
It is way overvalued. Should see 140s after ER
"They excluded Huawei payments which they will recoup just like with Apple. Smart that they were conservative with guidance. QCOM is easily a hold at $72.00 with divi. Analysts are clueless...QCOM will continue to innovate, and collect on patents...cant wait to see Apple's Intel 5G modem in 3 years :-)"
"QCOM said today at the shareholder meeting that it would not raise the dividend this year, breaking a long streak of annual increases. No reason was given. Any thoughts on why the dividend wasn’t increased this year?"
"This should be up more, they are going to buy back 44 billion of stock, right?"
Who deleted my comment that foreign companies trying to diminish US Qcom 5g and an American Korean judge sided with them.? I
"My fellow Americans, who shall we trust our national security to? On one side we have an American company born and raised with a 30 + year track record and a proven trust relationship with our government, a proven track record or of leadership and dominance in wireless communications or a foreign company with no history of dominance or leadership in anything, with only a track record of cost-cutting, penny-pinching, who will start off this venture $100 billion dollars in debt and is riddled with National Security risks. I think the choice is quite clear. Proven history over empty unobtainable promises. This will be the biggest natural security disaster in US history if it is allowed to proceed. Wireless communications is the backbone of all military operations."
I have a feeling Qualcomedy is going to miss earning
Guess not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
China awarded Qcom patent rights and ban on iPHOne cause viloating qcom patent. What a victory!
Happy New Year !

I read the transcript and don't understand 7% decrease in price. It should be increase of 7%
"I have not posted in a couple weeks, still ill about the CFO, how dumb. They missed revenue buy one tenth of one percent. It was pocket change. You can't tell me he could find enough money in someones desk drawer to cover that. They could have found it in the vending machines in the break room. All they did is give the naysayers a big stick to hammer QCOM by saying they missed on Revenue. Even if it was by a razors edge or a rounding error. Just no excuse for that. It may have still went down some but not by this amount. I would have him clean out his desk, Steve should found something to cover the short fall."

citi analyst ups fair trading price to $108! cream rises to the top as momma says.
70 coming?
Vote is delayed No one knows for how long that is why stock is going down but look at it this way it will give qcom time to negotiate qcom knows it is losing battle and that is why it is doing this. qcom is playing games
Grrrrr...Come on Qualcomm
Tomorrow it will be up 10% once people realize qcom just signed a huge deal with Huawey
why is everyone surprised the market is going down? As long as Biden has a chance of winning this election why on earth anyone would have hope for the future of this country?
Congratulations longs. It was a brutal couple of years but now we are rolling. Time for me to stop worrying about this stock and head on over to #UNH to figure out how I can salvage that one.
The only downgrade and people listen?????? Wonderful results...Easily $175+
there is still time
"There must be a hundred articles printed in the last few days saying that the Oculus Quest 2 will feature the Snapdragon XR2 processor. I can't imagine how many more will be printed, how many news stations will reference it and how many commercials will repeat that once Facebook makes it official during tomorrow's Facebook Connect conference! IMHO, this is going to be huge for Qualcomm and just the tip of the iceberg once others follow. By the way, any word on if the next iPhone will also feature something from Qualcomm?"
I am all in @147.05
I repeat 135 support with 120 target on this. Strong sell..

this is expected news from JudgeKoh based on her ego..9th circuit will get the required stay...just stay tuned
100 after ER
I just bought a chunk for my IRA - been waiting for a long time to get in - what a gift today is! I kicked myself for not buying 8 years ago when I initially was looking at the company. Long term hold in my opinion - this will be noise in a couple years. Just reinvest dividends.
Gotta love CNBC’s “unnamed source” that says there are no settlement talks. I got an unnamed source that says Q is going to $87 tomorrow!
"It wouldnt surprise me if mollenkopf didnt pop up on Cramer tonite... theyre long time buddiesI have been in this since the $50's.. used to trade in n out during the aapl rev suit days between 60s and 80s.. but with 5g I am staying long.. good tech, branching out, good div, prob will grow as well.. this bump will pass.. pot hole, knee jerk reaction"
"if not 110-115 for nxp, ADIOS! I see Q making deals and chips for auto industry anyway. for the right price nxpi is good. if not at good price ADIOS!"
"Honest assessment sought.Of the two, QCOM and SWKS, which plays a larger, more important role in the roll-out of 5G technology?"
"Hey Alex Smith from Insider Monkey, you are full of it. The Amana letter didn’t say QCOM was a sell. In fact it’s one of their largest holdings in the their growth fund. What they were doing was trying to explain their performance in the first quarter and highlighted QCOM as a stock that had dropped. Guess what? AAPL stock dropped by a similar amount at the end of Q1."

If Cramer believes in this company and Skyworks then I do too.
When does QCOM go ex-dividend?
I said few days ago that QCOM will be trading in $100... and now it is trading above $106.... still cheap considering they are expecting 20% growth per quarter at least for next 4 quarters.... meaning its still really cheap. Buy now at a discount. Next stop will be $150 in 6 months. Good luck and congrats lomgs.

"I just reread the CFIUS letter. As of March 5, CFIUS has determined that a full investigation was warranted and goes on to speak about what they will do during the investigation phase. From my reading, it would appear that the 45 -day clock started on March 5. Of note though, they only requested a 30 day delay in the shareholder meeting, so I would think they expect to conclude their investigation within 30 days even though they have 45 days. It appears from the letter that the 30-day review period began on January 29 or shortly thereafter."
Why down where is $95 did i missed
Up.
QCOM hits 90 the day Apple settles with them. I am more than happy to reinvest my div at these or lower prices until they do.
After APPLE SETTLES !!! HOW MUCH ??

"NXPI is the big news, but the coming Snapdragon 710 mobile chip is big news, being ignored, as well."
"QCOM just keeps racking up ""UPGRADES"" the story is easy to read!! This many money managers are not going to be wrong.And the so called Apple chip for 5G modems is a pipe dream. Intel failed and Apple is just spinning their wheels and spending money for a second rated ""Chip"". Apple had to go to QCOM for a first rate Chip, or their new phones would be piling up un-sold."
The decision should be pretty straight forward:Vote blue if you want the price to creep into the mid 70's in the next two weeks.Vote white if you want the price to drop to the 50's.Projections that fiscal 2019 will be great or just wait for us to execute on 5G or just wait until we straighten out our death match with Apple are promises without substance. The recent fines and very poor projection for next quarter when their competitors are thriving tells you what you need to know about the current team. The CEO's sale of 20% of his holdings at just under $66 per share is a crystal clear indicator that he doesn't even believe the B.S.Vote blue.
What is the best site for getting the best info on moderately safe options?

"There are incentives given to employees at many Chinese firms to not buy Iphones and there is the ban on the sale of Iphones due to the QCOM lawsuit that have caused a drop in Iphone sales in China.

It rotates into up trend. About time.

San Diego small verdict is really helpful
now the road is clear. only going up
"Don't forget the CEO interview on CNBC, chip orders are on track, new hire's, who do you think knows more about the company's business, 5G took a time delay hit, thats all 5G will not be stopped, China marches forward, Trump wants America to be the best with 5G, Samsung and others already selling phones, all with QCOM tech.Goldman didn't get rich by being honest, they got rich by knowing how to play the game."
"PT's keep moving up, so don't confuse market moves for the story."
Piper Sandler a$$clown bashing QCOM so that his firm can have an improved entry point into stock. Old school trick. What a tool. Hope he sleeps well at night knowing he is compromising his integrity.

If QCOM stock is so undervalued here - then QCOM managers should all take second mortgages on their homes and buy millions of shares on the open markets. But these guys are just leaches with no credibility.
Nice movement A/H; looks like the party is just starting. Good luck all longs
Why is apple complaining QCOM license fees when itself charges obscene of fees... (wile aapl is now selling phones almost at cost... and simply lives on these service fees.)
"Advice please I have yet to invest in QCOM I have $5,000 to invest thoughts ?? Thanks"
QCOM vs. AMD - Which is a better buy?
Anyone get a pic of $167 today? Will never see that ever again

This is putting a dent in my oil stock gains.
this is better than the other medication
So Qcom is guiding to a 100% increase in earnings next quarter while being severely capacity constrained during a pandemic. Wait! What? Are you kidding me? That’s just crazy talk.
"Kevin is that you selling me all these cheap shares as I scale back? If so thank you, you the best ever!"

"With the development of 5G in 2021, AR industry is bound to see rapid growth."
"every 5$ drop, imma buy 100 shares"
They might be feeling really good about the future Apple outcome. Otherwise why buy at these levels when a bad outcome would most likely present a much better buying opportunity. There was a reason why they had that final nxp deadline after extending week by week forever. That deadline might have been the last practical date they had to act just in case they didn’t get approval.
"QCOM CEO has zero negotiating skills. Goes on air 2 months ago essentially saying that resolution with Apple is imminent. Now Apple can stall a few months -> pressure increases on QCOM CEO to strike a deal -> QCOM shareholders get shafted again.November 28, 2018Qualcomm CEO: We're 'on the doorstep' of a resolution with AppleCNBC's Jim Cramer gets more on the Qualcomm-Apple dispute with Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf.Mollenkopf says the two companies are ""on the doorstep of finding a resolution.""The CEO adds that Qualcomm ""would love to work with Apple,"" especially on 5G."
Still baffles me how the DOJ requested the district courts take it easy on QCOM and not rush the verdict as we are battling China and the verdict came in during the middle of a trade war. Suspicious to say the least.
167 - 130 = -25% Qualcomm Stonks don’t only go up 
"An old Wall Street motto has been: “Never buy into a lawsuit.” This may be sound advice to the speculator seeking quick action on his holdings. But the adoption of this attitude by the general public is bound to create bargain opportunities in the securities affected by it, since the prejudice against them holds their prices down to unduly low levels.” - BENJAMIN GRAHAM"
The QCOM CEO sold almost 20% of his QCOM holdings on 12/18/17 for $65.38 per share netting $6.6M. He acquired the shares through vesting in the deferred sock compensation plan for no cash exchange.Does that sound like a guy that believes AVGO's offer materially undervalues QCOM.The hypocrisy in this sale is mind numbing given that it was AVGO's offers that drove the stock price.Vote blue.
I m issuing strong sell call with 130 support n target 120.
"Hmm... I suspect Qcom is playing the game in this process, perhaps believing Bcom lacks the ability to support a $90+ bid."
The revenge of Apple continues. Down we go worth <$100 since lost opps on i devices
buy more before earnings?
Glad I sold before ER
"Probably a slow day today and tomorrow. Look for buying on Friday (probably late) in case a deal is negotiated over the weekend. More buying on Monday ahead the vote. Possibly more on Tuesday, depending on when the vote is scheduled. Wednesday, with six new board members should be the huge up day (assuming they didn't get to a deal over the weekend)."
"What Qualcomm really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Qualcomm (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Qualcomm just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

I believe this case wont even last long and that would be in favor of QCOM easily. I am surprised apple thinks they have an argument. Remember this is a Jury case and if you ask 10 people on the street I bet you nine will say apple doesn't have a case to even argue. The reason for Apple to file the case is because they have nothing to lose and think might give a shot.

awesome this is 150 by 2021 hold for long term
QCOM should seek a partnership with Chip Manufacturers in US. They are way too reliant on foreign production.
"(TTOO), will be tomorrow $4.25"
"According to ANONYMOUS sources something MIGHT happen. I'm surprised that 1. this is news and 2. that there's any movmenet on this news 3. that anyone could possibly be surprised that AVGO would raise their initial offer for an unsolicited takeover. Regardless, congrats longs. Low 70's next week."
Not bad for this bad day actually. Means a buy point.
"since green close looks to be asking a whole lot these days, im hoping for a green open."
Acquired something. Story came out an hour ago.
qcom is the msft of wireless
Typical Apple. They have a contract with QCOM to use only their modem. I certainly hope that QCOM sues them for breach of contract.
"This was a good quarter and the forecast is also good. One number matters most: 187M MSM chipset sold and similar amount for the next quarter. So, the smartphone slow-down is not impacting QCOM and clearly is only/mainly in the high end, Apple and Samsung S9, which use also non QCOM parts.So, it looks like there is not much downside and plenty of upside here. Obviously, QCOM stock will also go up and down according to the overall market and sector, in 'sympathy'. But as soon as the various pending issues: litigation, NXPI, licensees payments etc., are resolved one way or another, there should be a good recovery in my view."
So should I buy now...or wait until tomorrow?
cover yet shorts
Qualcomm will acquire Apple in 2019
"90s, 80s, 70s, 60s ,,, 50s? Is the 50s range the natural stopping place for this stock or will it go to a lower floor again?"
"Boys and girls, it’s time to work on the appeal."
"I am neither a short or long at this time. But watching at the correction this morning, I don't see any uptick in the stock. It goes down $2 and comes back up $0.50.....which is only an indication that market makers are offloading their position. They will go long after the stock hits in 130s."
Qualcomedy is going to miss big on earning
$150 by the end of today 
Listen to the Bloomberg Interview with Romit Shah (linked on Yahoo Finance QCOM page). He is an analyst with no interest in either company and basically says it is over for QCOM as a standalone company.

My average is $80. I will get a couple more for fun.
Dont give in to hedge fund manipulation.
Revenue up 62% yoy...that sounds like a positive right.
BOD this morning had the opportunity to make a statement. They could have authorized a massive stock buyback given that - according to them - even at $82/share their stock is 'significantly undervalued'. But just like the last 10 years - they did nothing to support their shareholders.

I'm a new guy.....why BCOM willing to pay at least $79 but the market price of QCOM stiil around $65s.....what is the risk account for the price different? don't get it???

Turn down an $ 80 offer and end up with a stock price of $49. Big value creation.... for the shorts. Well done management.
The judge verdict is one sided and very much helping Korean and foreign Samsung LG .All research and innovation from QCOM means nothing.
Intel supplied modems in my iPhone X are horrible. QCOM chips are much superior when it comes to network chips. Loss for Apple customers on this issue.
what is seriously wrong with this stock. Like the most annoying stock in my portfolio. Like how long this stock take to recover from earnings?
our Don is back on a market red day..hilarious..he has been hiding behind and pounces on a red market day...i feel ER should blast his hopes of being red nexr week..
Can it be? Will Apple finally decide to enter into settlement talks? Hope so but I personally dont think so. It will be out-of-character for Tim.
"People will take some profit before the weekend, but that is a great side effect of being up 30% this week."
I see 5G service is now being offered in Houston and Sacramento by Verizon. Is QCOM benefiting from this or us Berizon using equipment and phones from another company?
Lol at whomever is buying this at record highs
AVGO to Buy QCOM is a great combination. Hold both companies. QCOM goes to $70.
200 here we come!
Qcom have been punished left and right but those days are near to end for good.Roylty issues are settling down and 5G is just started.Qcom was ahead of this technology now benifits and technologies are ready to address benifits.Good luck
what is going on? Down 3% on no particular news.
"GME ruined me, I’m waking up expecting to see 30-50%Gains daily and I’m getting .03% hahaha"
"6 year deal wow, going to add a lot more business to Qualcomm that everyone thought disappeared, making me seriously considering holding and buying more during the pullback tomorrow"
"Just added another 500 shares (2,500 total). At 5% yield and a p/e under 14% (assuming at least 3.60 in forward earnings), almost a no brainer. A lost a bunch of money on my options playing the AVGO acquisition, hope to make some of it back on the long shares."

"for so long the offer was $113 for nxpi. Elliot blew a ton of smoke and Wallah the deal was priced so expensive that I was hoping Qualcomm would walk. at this point it's worth it to pay the to 2B and simultaneously offer 95 / share in today's market that is still a premium to nxpi and a tremendous savings to Qualcomm. one of the fundamental spoofs in nxp eyes value is in the accounting process whereby they put a huge price tag on Goodwill. the only price tag I want to see is on actual Revenue in and out of the cash register. this has evolved into a geopolitical #$%$ contest as I have stated many times in the past. nobody has a crystal ball, wow that is the oldest cliche it is true. 5 years from now we will be able to look back and accurately Pick-A-Part where the mistakes were made or where the best deal was made. and in the end it all comes down to Apple never wanting to pay market price for anything. I cannot wait for Apple to blow up when they fell attempting to cut out everybody and cannibalize the entire industry."
Up she goes bye shorts!
@Fellow MM seems to be pushing it down below $67.
"Big run up into earnings. Earnings solid, outlook strong, sector conditions great. Profit taking now with a few weak hands. This goes up over time. If you are an investor then stay in and enjoy the expected appreciation. Good luck to the investors. I bought a lot more today - shares and LEAPs."
"Broadcom really needs QCOM, no reason for QCOM to give up on bid from AVGO unless they wanted the bid from AVGO to just run up the price of QCOM stock."
got in at 86.15 before closing bell hope it recovers tomorrow!
$120 tomorrow?
"QCOM is not going to buy NXPI, that horse has left the barn and in the end QCOM is actually pleased that it did not happen as they felt in the end that they were paying too much. Broadcomm has no interest, they wanted NXPI not in the deal when they were trying to buy QCOM."
Balance sheet is pristine. Once this quiet period is over. Can you say buyback.
$64 is a reasonable entry point.?Experts need your opinion..please
Once FTC is resolved this will go up 30% in one day. Mark my words!!

Oh man if people starts to short and FTC settlement comes out this will blow up!
NXPI deal gets done. AAPL settles because they must! QCOM controls 5g and autonomous car markets. Throw in wireless medical field. Sentiment on this board is perfect bottom making. Dividend now 5% and going up. Stock buy back occurring now. Whom do you think you're shorting too? Not the stoops!
Major announcements in the 5G pipeline. Wowww
MY FIRST BUY WILL BE $133
$160 s/b in our hands next week!
"buying more, ~144 is a great price"
What is Don's reaction?
"From the CC transcript, I felt that they said this throughout the call, they've got all the bases covered...Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Great. I think the question I get the most is just the sustainability of handset builds, obviously, it has been very robust. It seems like there is some investment to try to take share away from Huawei and yet. Huawei still has inventory still shipping. So can you just generally characterize the handset environment and the inventory environment that you're in heading into the strongest part of the year?Akash PalkhiwalaYes, hi. This is Akash. So we are seeing some minor elevated demand across certain OEMs, given the uncertainty of the OEM mix, especially in China and how things play out. So that's already contemplated in our forecast. As we look forward -- and in our forward commentary. As well as we look forward, we expect some uncertainty over the next few months. ******But really when you step back from that, and just look at overall design win pipeline and customer traction, it's really very consistent with the comment Cristiano made earlier where our technologies and our portfolio are really set up to take benefit from it, whether it's Huawei, who -- if we're allowed to ship to them or if other OEMs pick up that share*******."

About this time yesterday I checked AVGO after earnings. It was up about $11 per share in AH trading. It gave it ALL up today!
Shorts getting caught again today I think... Let's put the ask at $95 and see what happens..
This stock should be above 80 this week. Let's go.

"I'm a shareholder (probably small number compared to most people) and I voted for the current management (Steve Mollenkopf) during the Brocade thing.But now I don't see how this is going to work.What was I thinking?It ended up not mattering which way I voted, but I should have gotten out at $68 when I had the chance.China will never approve the NXP deal.They have every incentive to distract and bring down QUALCOMM because Huawei is also working on 5G.Why would they do anything to help QUALCOMM?Apple wants to pay QUALCOMM $4 or less per iPhone instead of the 8-10 that Qualcomm wants.At this point, any litigation will take 6 months at least.And even if the case goes against apple, they will immediately appeal (they always instantly appeal, right?).That will take forever.The QCOM share price is so low, there will be another take over starting in November.It seems inevitable.Another year of share prices in the $50 and take over.The current management had a good environment the last few years (other chip makers have done well).No major execution issues (if you ignore the 810 over heating garbage but that was a few years ago).It seems Steve Mollenkopf single handedly crippled a profitable company.For a top ten compensated CEO, you'd expect more.What a mess.I should just wait until November for the next buyout, but it's annoying the management can be so incompetent and make so much money while being incompetent.What am I missing?How can things possible improve with the current management?Is Steve just taking time putting together his golden parachute?"
Donnie's press conference on china tomorrow. be ready have ur seat belt on. #amd #mu #nvda #qcom #tsm #ttd #jd #huya. indexes are retreating.
This is classic breakout and classic short squeeze pattern. Beware QCOM will hit much higher than you think.
"Just read an interesting Seeking Alpha article that came in the evenings email on Micron, MU trapped me after the Covid takedown, but they have recovered nicely giving me a 16 point gain, but anyway the article indicates that Micron is seeing broad end-market demand with mobile, auto, industrial, PC and cloud all experiences surging demand for NAND and DRAM, with industrial being the only lagging end-market.They've currently got a PT of $80.00 and are knocking on $70.00's doorThe firm has pushed up its estimate for FY21 revenue to $23.6B and expects FY22 revenue of $27.6BObviously we all are here because of our belief in chips and fractionally my MU is much smaller than my QCOM, but I'm kind of looking at it as if they kind of complete each other.GLTA"
Manu foolish analysts are realizing Apple SOC won't be available in at least next 5-6 years.There is no guarantee that Apple will succeed in making one - which Intel gave up.Now is the good time to invest in QCOM while this company is still undervalued
"Yessss Amazing newsss for Qcom!! Tomorrow stock will fly!!! After smart money actually read the decision, Qcom will soar!!!The judge said a contract is a contract!! And its binding and has to be respected!!! So yeah Qcom according to the rebate clause has to pay Apple $1 billion, but the royalty clause is also to be respected, so Apple has to pay $8 billion to Qcom!!This means Apple just lost the pattent war!!! https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-qualcomm/u-s-judge-rules-qualcomm-owes-apple-nearly-1-billion-rebate-payment-idUSKCN1QV3EV?utm_source=applenews"
looked at calls for two weeks out to catch earnings plus just a little more time. looked at 90 strike. in my head was thinking perhaps a buck or two. was trading 5-6 bucks!! that's a lotta faith. lemme see what the puts look like.
Intel. New CEO. Buyout looming.
Fast money just said if your looking for value in a chip stock look at QCOM. Guy also said that he would surprised when it broke $148.00
This stock hasn't done anything in 5 years. Through a great market and if there wasn't an offer on the table then it would be down over the last 5 years. It is time someone else takes over this company. If you are smart you would vote for the takeover. There is no way they are going to do what they say earnings wise in the next few years. Broken promises to keep their jobs and the company to remain intact. Ask the CEO to bet his job on the earnings projection. Not a chance. Please vote the blue proxy.
Best buy in 2 weeks for me guys! QCOM Jun 18 2021 145 CallI just bought 30 calls on this baby by the close and only $12.65 a contrat
hope we get a bounce soon!

Dont let news of the Apple-QOM deal mask what Apple is doing on the side. It is working furiously to create its wholly own 5G chipsets/modems. Opening a 5G lab in SanDiego by hiring hundreds of engineers poached from others (including QCOM) and grabbing from Intel its premiere 5G leader(s).See news. Meaning that sooner or later Apple wont need QCOM. Hope QCOM is smart enough to prepare for that eventuality.
Qcom management fumbles again. street has voted :(((((

$170 come on
QCOM could have had 82 per share from AVGO and they turned it down. Back to $50. I hated AVGO cause I owned it at 255 and was getting killed with them trying to buy QCOM but you guys won't see 82 for years.
"My gut feeling is that the NXPI deal doesn't happen. It would be nice if it did, but not necessary for QCOM's successful future. I always thought the AVGO thing was an uninteresting sideshow orchestrated by AAPL. This Samsung/QCOM development is interesting and could be a shot across AAPL's bow."
Its going back up. Can we close green?

35 million shares traded today
If the Judge issues a stay and the appeal takes a long time couldn't we business as usual well into 5G Apple rollout?
NXPI at $93 and the QCOM offer at $127 is a 10 billion dollar overpay. $105 was more appropriate.
QCOM INTC + GSAT???
"Regarding the board member vote, Joe invester with just a couple thousand shares is powerless. The decision will be made by institutions that often think differently than you and me. For example, I was planning for a stepped up tax basis upon inheritance, but instead my family will be on the hook for a huge tax bill if forced to sell in a cash deal. Such concerns are irrelevant to instutional investors. It really stinks that we are getting jerked around."
Buying for future...
Do you think this is just a poison pill? That Qcom didn't really want to relinquish it's company and this is a way of preventing the acquisition?

"I am not selling at any price! Qualcomm must remain as an independent company. Continue to do research and development to move the wireless technologies forward to 5G and beyond. The United States must remain in the leadership position for cellular communications. If you look at the list of companies that contributed to the 4G LTE Standard Essential Patents Portfolio, Qualcomm, 350 patents; Huawei, 182; Ericsson, 146; Nokia, 142; Norte, 46; Siemens, 32; Motorola, 16; Alcatel 9. Apple, Intel, and Broadcom , 0. These three companies made no contributions to the 4G LTE Standard! They are the free loaders! These essential patent holders are required to license their patents under FRAND licensing methods. The rates each holder can charge depends on the number of patents each contributed to the Standard Essential patents Portfolio. Qualcomm, 3.3 percents; Huawei, 1.5; Ericsson, 1.5 ; Nokia, 1.5; Norte, 1.0, .....This licensing model was the creation of the Telecommunications Industry Association as a way to compensate the Essential patents holders for their contributions to the industry's Cellular Standard. Apple claimed to have gazillion innovations yet make no contributions to the 4G LTE Standard ! And refused to pay the royalties for using these patents. It is very sad to see the world biggest company benefited from the FRAND licensing method and pick a petty fight to save a few bucks. Shameful ! Qualcomm must remain independent to lead the world in wireless communications developments. Your opinions, please. Should we destroy the FRAND licensing method or enforce the patents law?"
a great time to buy in as I just did. any day this is making a good run.

why doesn't this stock take off????
Analysts are working OT tonight to come up with new price target. $90 tomorrow. Woot woot
New AVGO offer is out: $57 cash plus $22 in shares for a purchase price of $79. An automatic increase of $3 cash is included in the event the NXPI deal does not go through. AVGO appears confident of winning all six seats.
David Faber of CNBC reporting QCOM trying to buy NXPI “for low 120’s”. They were making the calls to the big holders late Friday and Saturday. Nobody is returning their calls.
"QCOM is expected to earn $5.25 / sh after adding NXP's projections of $1.84 / shAlso a resolution with AAPL is expected to add $1.50 / sh Broadcom disagrees. Says it's not $5.25 but $4.50 and Apple handshake is only $1 (not $1.50).Hence the best and final offer of $57 cash and $22 stock. Even by Broadcoms measure we want to know which TECH company earns $5.50 and is at a share price of $79.In fact Semiconductor industry average PE is 22 placing an average valuation of $121 for NXP-COM.Broadcom itself has had a fast and furious stock run up on weak fundamentals. Now that NXP is nearly in the bag, we want Broadcom to offer a fair valuation - even if it comes after a full quarter post NXP-QCOM merger - when Broadcom is able to see the increased earnings and strong forecast:$121 all cash, or$100 cash + 0.2 AVGO stock, or$60 cash + 0.5 AVGO stock for each QCOM share"
"Guys.. could you tell which company makes Radio frequency semiconductor, pls .. is it Qualcom"
Start the buyback.
Texas Instruments beats easily. Great ! Can’t wait for May 1...
NXPI up 6 bucks last minute. No impact on QCOM price. Interesting
Earnings and guidance was great. China won’t impact at all Qualcomm.

"This reaction is dumb, thanks to those weak hands for the unexpected money making opportunity!"
I filled in the blue proxy and I am hoping for the best.........stock has been going sideways for some time now.
95 tomorrow?
All aboard
"This is exactly what I posted here shortly after NXP deal fell through and they announced buy back: the stock will raise to the 70s, but in the long run this buy back isn’t good for the company if management can not find new business model and strategies to innovate; one bad news or market swing can easily wipe out the buy back gains. Congrats on those who shorted at the 70s :)"
"Finally a great buying opportunity, this is back at 175 in no time"
Thank goodness I sold last week..dead money now

"Netlist (NLST) is ""largely overlooked"" Who’s/What’s Netlist?Netlist holds several patents in server, storage, and hybrid memory, as well as rank multiplication and load reduction.What’s goin on here (the main course anyways)?Netlist has been in litigation with Googs since 2009 over allegations that Googs infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 hardware patent. Netlist alleges that Googs infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Googs on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Googs indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Googs then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Googs requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Googs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Googs was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Googs did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Googs shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021.So, what’s the big deal?Netlist has a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Googs to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Googs dominance in search engine capability. Right now, it is not a question whether Googs infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Googs is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages.What are the damages? Are they substantial?Damages will take into account both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Googs dominance in regards to their search engine, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Goog’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Goog’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace. Netlist will most likely seek billions in damages. Also, the prospect of treble damages is in play as Netlist will allege willful infringement on Goog’s part. The most likely scenario is Googs will settle the case rather than risk going in front of a jury. A settlement would include a large lump sum plus licensing of the patent going forward.Anything else going on?Yeah you bet! Netlist also sued Inphi for infringement of the 912 patent in the US District Court for the Central District of California. That case was also stayed pending the Court of Appeals decision, and now that the 912 patent was upheld it is expected Netlist will resume court proceedings once it is finished with the Googs case.Also, on March 2020 Netlist filed a patent infringement lawsuit against SK Hynix in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas based on the infringement of Netlist’s 218, 523, and 595 patents in SK Hynix’s RDIMM and LRDIMM server memory products. SK Hynix petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) to change the venue from Texas to California. This petition was denied and the case will be tried in Texas. The Markman hearing was set for March 4, 2021 with Jury trial set for July 6, 2021. The Western District of Texas is notorious for being very pro-patent holder friendly.$AMD $MU $QCOM"

"On October 15th, the FTC and QCOM jointly requested a delay (until November 14th) of the judge's ruling on an FTC motion for a partial summary judgement. The two parties stated the delay would facilitate ongoing settlement discussions.It is now November 2nd, and earnings are due after the bell November 7th, next Wednesday, just a few business days away.Wouldn't you think QCOM would love to have something positive to report regarding the FTC?Just a dream, I know."
Time for the current management team to exit. This all started with the Broadcomm takeover where they held themselves out as the national treasure. Now they are stuck with that and the courts will force them to share that treasure with other US companies. Live by the sword and die by the sword.
I would suspect AVGO will raise their offer just to prove they want QCOM. They don't want to let the deal slip away when they are so close!
"on tues hedge funds had to cover their game stop short positions. had to sell some of their qcom to cover. this shook up qcom apple cart a little, that's all. hopefully qcom will be back where it belongs Shortly."
It seems that it takes some time to recover...
Just shaking out all the weak hands

"Going through the court decision paper:Market Share and Market Power: during the court case in Jan, FTC and Q presented witnesses in respect of defining a monopoly in Q case. No presentation was used, no FTC witness was even mentioned. Instead : to define monopoly, court used a) define relevant market b) show dominant share of that market c) show barriers for competition to enter that market. Disturbing is c): for both CDMA and Premium modems, high investments are quoted to be the barrier to enter these markets; competitors have not been ready for these investments, due to this barrier the court concludes that Q had a monopoly. At the same time, Q is challenged to charge too high prices. This is ridiculous for my taste, complete absence of economical expertise and common sense. Q was ready to invest, competitors not —> Q is monopolist and not allowed to charge respective price. Unbelievable!! Look pages 22 to 41. Reg. Anticompetitive Conduct and Harm: Court only refers to statements of competitors and/or manufacturers. Is the court/FTC protecting competitors or consumers ? Harm to consumers by Q not even mentioned once. See pages 41 to 113. Very disturbing to think that statements of competitors impact the ruling, as no competitor or manufacturer is quoting the benefits of Q inventions or products. Court has points reg. exclusitivity of contracts. To give licenses to competitors, court ignores other court rulings (Texas) or interpretations (ETSI) completely. All in all: shocking how constructed all this seems to be. Arguments in favor of Q: not existing. As we talk important content: Shocking."

At QCOM's own 5 yr. blended avg P/E of 23.05, even if it meets estimates of a huge 70+% YOY e. increase, that's still only $167. Not a bad gain for EOFY21, but not enough margin-of-error undervaluation. I have to stick to my rules...hopefully I'm wrong."

Broadcom is 90% owned by institutions most of which are U.S. based. The BOD is composed primarily of Americans. The CEO is a U.S. citizen that resides in the U.S. Broadcom is in the process of a move to the U.S. The Treasury letter filed with the SEC today by QCOM questions Broadcom's business model that demands R&D accountability and maximizing shareholder value. They fear a reduced R&D investment for long term initiatives. Since when did QCOM shareholders become primarily responsible for the Treasury Department's priorities? By what right does the Treasury get to dictate the R&D priorities and business model of a commercial business?

"A little disappointed. Went to get some punch and there were two turds (QCOM and QRVO) in the punch bowl. A lesson learned again to buy the rumor and sell the news. I have only a little bit of time to have the options I purchased today come back or it was a losing ""bet"".So with a total blow out report by SWKS, and moderate beat by QRVO and only a meet expectations by QCOM, is SkyWorks now the king of 5G. Has QCOM passed the torch?"
simple solution the chip price gets raised to compensate for the lower royalty.
Looks like Apple bargaining the same way with courts as they do with suppliers. Of course not determined they loose before that asking “can we pay less if we loose ?” Please let everyone live Apple.
Me thinks most of selling done. Will finish green today and fly next week. Into ER and most importantly guidance. That will be as bullish as a call can be. You want to own it now. IMHO
Low guidance is the problem. It will be under $60 tomorrow.
Great news...........

"Ten year bond yield = 1.370% yea, I'm selling my tech holding to get 1.370% I would burn my shares before I would do that. What complete moronic thinking did this human have. Call it a brain fr--t!Copy and paste from WSJ article. get ready here is what it said = That increases the attractiveness of government bonds—often seen as a safe-haven investment—while reducing the allure of tech stocks.How could a sane person even begin to write such an outlandish statement?? Come on tell me!!Lets hear this again = while reducing the allure of tech stocks!! Tell me I'm reading this right??Did Byron Wien crawl out from under a rock some where. He was Bear for most of the high Tech rally of the 1990's. Most young folks will not understand why I said his name."
As I said. Buy. Buy.

"Why was this selloff in chip and other stocks any different than what happened with Gamestop in reverse. With Gamestop, a ton of people 'rotated' into the stock. Yesterday, a ton of people and organizations 'rotated' out of chips. All at the same time. All coordinated. To me, that's collusion, and at the very least is proof of manipulation. With Gamestop, we have an investigation because a lot of the big boyz lost a lot of money, here it's the little guy that lost a lot of money. There will be no investigation but I suggest everyone write their Senator requesting they look into this. THE MARKET IS RIGGED, and yesterday and today is unequivocal proof."

"What is going on with the NXPI tender? Would have thought they had the votes already considering it should have been closed before the annual meeting. If the meeting was held tomorrow and they had China approval, it would have looked pretty embarrassing they couldn’t get across the finish line because of that. Also, NXPI must be quickly starting to realize they could be owned by Hock Tan soon given AVGO is already crushing QCOM in the vote count. I guess they really don’t care about anyone but the shareholders when it comes down to it. Something QCOM should learn."
"The whole tech market is dropping, this is just a very very normal rotation. Money flows into the companies which severely devastated by pandemic like CCL and flights. I will buy more and keep patient."

"What Qualcomm really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Qualcomm (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Qualcomm just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

people posting on here that don't allow anyone on here to respond to what they post should not be posting.
"Here is the reason why I thing QCOM will eventually win the court battle over Apple. QCOM won the same argument in courts in Europe a few years back against Nokia and will win it again this time because once the issue is dissected Apple has no case:Without QCOM essential patents there would not be a wireless internet access (at a meaningful speed) that would thrive the smart phone business. In other words all the smart phone manufacturers will not be where they are today (specially Apple) if it wasn't because of QCOM's breakthrough inventions in 3G and 4G. So the court judge will ask this question from a potential apple customer to determine who should win the court case. The question is:How much would you pay for an iPhone if it didn't have any wireless capability except through WiFi? Meaning you could only access the internet at home. If the answer is people still would pay the full price, then judge will vote in favor of Apple. But if they say they wouldn't pay anything, then judge will vote in favor of Qualcomm and grant permission for QCOM to continue with the existing model. In my opinion no one would buy an iPhone without a 3G/4G capability. And it is only fair for QCOM to be rewarded for their inventions in 3G/4G so they can continue funding the 5G and future technologies.Notice that this model was not invented by QCOM. It is also used by Nokia and Erickson and was blessed by the communication industry to increase the competition and keep the price of the chips low. That is why you pay only $40 for a QCOM snapdragon but you pay $300 for an intel chip. That is the proof that the system worked. Apple probably pays more for the plastic material it uses in iPhone than the money it pays Qcom for their breakthrough inventions in 3G/4G and the modem chips they use."

This company exists only for insiders to profit at the expense of shareholders. So many 'yes sir' guys keep getting promoted (from what I hear) based on internal connections while the guys in trenches don't get recognized.
"It's good news but let's just remember it's a plan. It doesn't necessarily mean that plan will be enacted. If it was to the full $10 bill extent, given the co's market value, it would certainly have a material effect. If you do the math, eps could go higher by 50 cents. Hang a 15x multiple on that and you get a 7.5 point increase in share price. Not sure if I'd prefer nxp or a full 10 bill buyback.....I just want something."

What’s going on with the 10% down after hours? Is it because of earnings not meet expectations?
Breached the $90 firewall. This isn’t funny anymore. The price could go into free-fall without more 5G hype to keep the price above $90 before the close. The CEO needs to update guidance today or Monday before the shorts take over.

Exactly. New CEO. Is just waiting In the wings to make announcements and deals.
Qcom made Apple bend over and settle. No other company can withstand the torture Apple threw at Qcom. No wonder market believes in Qcom and will keep giving it a good multiple and price even if ER is not as great as it used to.
"Manipulated so hard to catch all the short term options. This is not new for big company like QCOM. Relax, build up your position at each dip, give some time, you will not disappointed"
"apparently, the UK crooks have decalred war on qcom so that that they may steal money from qcom. Why doesn't the same concept hold for apple and samsung. These two companies charged much much more than the added cost of the qcom tech for their phone thus, hurting consumers. These companies should also have to pay. It is not clear to me how qcom tech price hurt consumers. Apple and samsung passed this cost plus added some extra."

QCOMEDY is back!
"I sold it last month around 157, and I am happy if this drop under 110, I would like to buy it back."
"QCOM: the troubles and the magnitudes are a lot bigger than everyone can possibly perceive.It is not,"" Even the left hand does not know what the right hand doing"" but it is, ""Even the right hand does not know what the right hand is doing,"". 2. QCOM must get it the sooner the better. QCOM must file a review petition in front of the same judge for grant of immediate ""stay order"" againt the court's ruling and petition the court to appoint a mediator or arbitrator, in the meantime. 3. This will save it and the shareholders a lot of money and time. Otherwise QCOM will be doing and going through the same procedure and practices after a year or so, anyway, no matter what its attorneys claim."
"Just shorted 5,000 shares of Qualcomm at $147.30 thank you thank you !! This is an easy $10,000 to $15,000 gain before the end of the day. Look at the chart it’s gone up too fast, it will retrace back to $138 - $139.50 once the hype is gone. So sell and lock  in you gains and don’t be left holding the bag ."
For prudent investors the choice is simple. Vote blue for an immediate jump of at least 18-20% in stock price. Vote white and there will be an immediate drop of at least 7-12% followed by at least two years of (at best) sideways action. Then if QCOM is successful in implementing their vision a return to current prices and possible another 7-15% gain in the third year.
"Evercore today:Obviously the hits keep on coming and until a stay is granted it is difficult to want to jump in aggressively (likely a 45- to 90-day window since filing),” he wrote. “But our positive thesis on 5G remains intact and we would expect investor enthusiasm to gain momentum into the company’s planned Analyst Day in November.”Not much to add. 45 days from filing to the 9th gives mid September."

"Qualcomm has had a roller coaster ride for many, many years yet it keeps defying gravity and ultimately goes up. If your looking for a rather quick buck then perhaps you should buy and sell this stock, but remember, the tortoise always beats the hare. To all the naysayers, say what you will, but I'm long and up 1000%."

At their event, Qualcomm announced their first discrete dedicated AI processors, the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 family. Designed from the ground up for the AI market and backed by what Qualcomm is promising to be an extensive software stack, the company is throwing their hat into the ring for 2020, looking to establish themselves as a major vendor of AI inference accelerators for a hungry market.""""So what exactly is Qualcomm doing? In a nutshell, the company is developing a family of AI inference accelerators for the datacenter market. Though not quite a top-to-bottom initiative, these accelerators will come in a variety of form factors and TDPs to fit datacenter operator needs. And within this market Qualcomm expects to win by virtue of offering the most efficient inference accelerators on the market, offering performance well above current GPU and FPGA frontrunners.""""The actual architectural details on the Cloud AI 100 family are slim, however Qualcomm has given us just enough to work with. To start with, these new parts will be manufactured on a 7nm process – presumably TSMC’s performance-oriented 7nm HPC process. The company will offer a variety of cards, but it’s not clear at this time if they are actually designing more than one processor. And, we’re told, this is an entirely new design built from the ground up; so it’s not say a Snapdragon 855 with all of the AI bits scaled up.""https://www.anandtech.com/show/14187/qualcomm-reveals-cloud-ai-100-family-of-datacenter-ai-inference-accelerators-for-2020"

"clearly the stocks early day pullbacks are designed to shake out short term longs.This goes much higher , but they just can't do it all in one day so they will be methodical about it.See you in a few months when it's sitting at $120"
"I bought more today, had to."
"I bought QCOM last year at around 53 to invest with a good company with a high div who was going to own NXPI and start the roll out of 5G, not to make a quick buck selling it to a huckster that would strip it for parts ."
"Unfortunately for the day traders, this stock will take another year or two to take off. 5G is not ready for prime time yet, and the infrastructure is still getting ready. Most supporting companies (like Towers and chip makers) are getting geared up for when 5G is ready, but we need at least a year before that happens."
champagne and caviar plus 80 wowww
Overreaction. The same happented to INTC. Will be back on track in two weeks.
Qualcomm Inc. shareholder T. Rowe Price Group Inc. voted for all six of Broadcom’s nominations.
Today starts the 3 day Snapdragon Summit where QCOM will be un-veiling their long awaited 5G platform. It's said to be a total game changer and going to WOW the market with it's 10x 4G capabilities. I predict QCOM will rally to the 62-65 range by next week after the world sees what QCOM has up it's sleeve with it's new 5G technology. GO QCOM!
Boom back in the 90s
$130 gap to be filled QCUM is R.I.P. for a while $167 is a forever high
one step up two step down
At least a 2% drop on Monday to $85. Easily under $80 if more phone factories are shut down or slowed down. No dividend increase in March due to cash flow uncertainty this year.
"Apple was in a weak position going to trial. They are loosing market share and had bet on Intel and it could not deliver 5G chipset. Huwei chipset is not politically and security risk acceptable. Samsung is a competitor and their commercial terms would be stiff. Regardless, Apple would need help in integrating the chip set into their phones. Plus Apple needs the non-essential patents from QCOM regarding power control and fast charging. Would stiff have continuing litigation and liabilities. So Apple had to cave in. It is going to cost $10B in back royalties plus interest, legal fees. I suspect royalties are not going to be cheap. QCOM can not afford to lower royalties because rest of licensees will demand similar terms. Huwei, Samsung will have to cave in. Forward Earnings are around $5/s and this deal could add $2 per CNBC estimate. I think it could be higher because of chipset set margins increasing. Plus revenues from other phone makers. Depends on 5G network deployment. QCOM has been a difficult stock for me. Lot of heart burn. I bought 6,250 shares at around $38 back in Sep-98. After the Nokia settlement in Feb-99, the stock took off and had 2:1 split and still went to $800/s in Jan-2000. I was young and stupid and did not sell and it dived. Sold in 2005 along with other cat and dog stocks that did worse. Waaah! The stock has been stuck in range due to dilution to management awards, buybacks, etc week after week. Then there were bad acquisitions that had to be written off (Netzero, display tech, etc). Not to mention litigation, etc. Simple math tells me this stock could make $8-10/s and PE could expand all the way to 18-20. However, nothing is simple about this company. After being humbled by the market, it is important to have an exit strategy. At this stage of my life I am focussed on spending... not as much fun as it would have been in Jan-2000."

I’m adding more shares. This flutter will pass soon and up we go!!

Apple will develop their own chips
"If you want to take something positive away from today, QCOM significantly beat the SOX. Really first time in recent memory. Other SEMIs were hurt about twice as bad as QCOM today."
"bank of America analyst just upgraded qcom to a buy and price target $75.00, this my friends is a golden opportunity to buy a well know established company at a discount , and that pays a dividend"
"The quarter, even if lets say on a theoretical THIS quarter, THEORETICALY, which Im of the mind they will beat like they have in the last FOUR quarters, which technically those last four were 'so tough on the industry', outlook is a year...this is a buy on dip and hold stock, quite literally look at dip as 'discounted' prices. This a beyond quarter kinda stock. But Like I said, they'll the expectations like they have all last year, the 'tough' year for chips...lile they have been doing. Rest well friends."
The Justice Department finally realized that the ONLY American company producing the core of 5G technology CAN NOT be Stymied. Doing that gives the Chinese UNCHECKED advantage in the 5G space. What was that other judge thinking.
Every stock atm is selling off after earnings?This is over done tho right?Why 10% thats madddd

"I believe Patrick Moorhead would put his money on QCOM (regarding the discussion below). There is a recent article in Forbes which summarizes his outlook from the 'Investor Day' meetings with QCOM. By the way, I'm wondering if O'Neil's ""3 week tight"" formation is exemplified by the weekly chart (where 1 week = a candle). I believe probably not '3 week tight' because the wicks are too long. Probably a correction required from here (an hour from the close) Jan 02, 2020."

"Tic Toc... the days are counting down!How big is the Chinese market for Qualcomm? We don’t have the exact numbers – but it frankly looks enormous and growing.

The Mi11 smartphone is the first phone powered by the new Snapdragon 888 processor, which includes Qualcomm’s Fastconnect 6900 client-side Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E platform. In this case the phone will not be configured for Wi-Fi 6E because China has thus far not released the 6 GHz band."
"Thanks for the nice dip. Bought some more. So, let me get this straight. Q has the superior 5 g modem for phones. Intel is inferior. I-Phone ""talks"" of buying Intel's modem business so that they can put inferior modems in their phones? Oh - so they can develop their own 5 g modems - just in time for 6 g release a couple of years from now? Is that about it?"
Bought some Oct 120 calls this morning So far so good.
FUNDAMENTALLY NOTHING CHANGED!STILL THE KING OF 5G AND STRONG DEMAND!!5G ERA JUST STARTED WITH OPERATORS ARE INSTALLING 5G INFRASTRUCTURE
"A snippet from The Verge commenting on this CONVENIENT & TIMELY (for shorts and those that want in cheaper) release by Bloomberg.Qualcomm has more than physical radio chips going for it, of course; it also has a tremendous amount of intellectual property around cellular that it licenses to companies like Apple (and has been accused of using in anticompetitive ways, though it recently won an antitrust suit against the FTC). Ahead of Apple’s purchase of Intel’s modem business, it reached a surprise settlement with Qualcomm over patent infringement and struck a multiyear deal around the companies’ wireless IP — one where it wound up paying Qualcomm $4.5 billion, and where Apple wound up getting the Qualcomm chips it needed to build this year’s 5G iPhones.With its own cellular radios, Apple could at least be LESS reliant on Qualcomm. At best, it could build a better performing radio and offer better battery life, like it did with its new ARM chips vs. Intel.To be honest, the most “”SURPRISING”” thing about the Bloomberg report is that an Apple town hall meeting LEAKED at all, considering how SECRETIVE the company typically is. Bloomberg also reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed when employees might return to the company’s physical offices during that meeting, saying it “seems likely” that most teams won’t return before June 2021."
Close over $150. Over sold

I wlll buy $5000 worth on shares next week if drops more i will go all in at $25000k more
What a #$%$ Can?t believe they had such a miss on revenue and then matched guidance. Horrible quarter during a crazy boom with semiconductors..#$%$ management how the F you miss during these times...5G is huge and ramping up and you guidance matched analysts??? I hope it burns to the ground...
You cheerleaders understand that if you had sold your shares to Broadcom for $82 that you'd likely be looking that the equivalent of $88 to $90 now?
"Senators Urge $1 Billion Plan to Loosen China’s Grip on 5GA bipartisan group of U.S. senators, alarmed by the rise of Chinese electronics supplier Huawei Technologies, wants Washington to subsidize firms that could counter China’s 5G advances.First thing they need to do is Slap Down the FTC Lucy Koh's bias ruling on QCOM.Only a Socialist of the worse kind could have made such a insane ruling on a great American company that can insure Hardware and Software security!!

poor apple. trump to put tariffs on iphone. boo hoo. they said they plan to inject 55B to american suppliers in 2018. well its almost 2019. how about starting that influx with the 7B to pay Qcom bill!
why QCOM stock drop big in AH based on Intel poor earning? QCOM should be up instead.

"Don was supposed to leave the board for good when QCOM hits $100. That was the deal. Old deal, but nonetheless.. think he will stick to the deal?? LOLOL"
"news out today that Intel will be the recipient of all of Apple's modem business is laughable. Intel chips are slower and inferior to Qualcomm's and will be for years to come as we move into 5G where Qualcomm is leading the pack. Apple is finding it hard enough to sell an $1,100 iPhone but to sell an inferior $1,100 iPhone will make it doubly difficult. isn't it funny how the timing of this rumor comes out at precisely the time that broadcom makes its best and final bid for Qualcomm. What a joke apple and broadcom are colluding to bring down Qualcomm"
"QCOM is just scratching at the 52 week hi. Other tech players are not only at 52 week highs but all-time, silly valuation highs. Q also has the buyback going for it. And someone is about to be assigned $1.5b worth of QCOM on September 1 because the 198,000 Aug 31 $90 player hasn’t covered yet"
"Citi is such a joke. How is it that ""the 5G upside"" is likely over? This sell off is definitely not rational. A big discount!"

Will the new CEO have the same/better credentials? Nervous. I watched the way Steve talked and he's very knowledgeable and well-spoken.
Wow my $60.00 shares went above $104.00 today.

"If China approves deal, does this put AVGO buying Qualcomm back in the picture?Don’t forget the chairman of Qualcomm stepped down to pursue taking company private"
Good buying point because 5G is just started and no one has closest tech than Qcom

"dividends and 5G super Rollout will ignite this to over $80 ,,,"
"Multi year bull run is right ahead, any selloff is the last opportunity to accumulate longs before QCOM overturn and explode their revenue beyond 2020."
It's called a Head Fake
Silly reaction to a great company. Most likely triggered by large funds willing to buy more. Back to 160s before tomorrow evening.
People don't realize they will compensate minimizing revenue impact even QCOM loses. Selloff is great opportunity to accumulate longs as they have clear path moving forward.

Was thinking of getting back into QCOM last few days so it is good to see it up however I don't understand the euphoria that Broadcom will make a bigger offer than previously now that QCOM is buying NXPI and will have $30B net debt. Broadcom was perhaps after QCOM's cash but with the NXPI buyout that money is gone.
hit bottom 6 times
I agree with 7. To 8 bucks. EPS. Multiply that by 30. Well over 200 ez. Money.
Apple bring it on. When is the settlement and how much?
Are the managers who received million dollar bonuses when Apple settled going to give them back if they lose this case?
Qcom is the center of the universe for 5G
Buy buy buy before the news!
The tide has turned and 5G will benefit QCOM greatly!
It's clear that it's last opportunity before we go beyond 100
Give QCOM management props for meeting with AVGO tomorrow. Wednesdays are typically golf days for these guys - showing some sacrifice for the good of shareholders.
"J check this out. Koh has a bad memory or lies. Koh had a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 11, 2010. She received some questions from Republican Senator Jeff Sessions regarding her writings in law school where she said that minority judges must maintain the ""disguise of objectivity"" or face challenges. Sessions expressed concern about what that might mean about her own objectivity on the bench. Koh responded by saying that she had forgotten that she ever wrote the passage and that she ""completely disagree[d] that there [was] no objectivity. Our rule of law would break down if everyone were to insert their own personal biases."" [15] The Committee voted to forward her nomination to the full Senate on March 4, 2010, and on June 7, 2010, the Senate voted 90-0 to confirm Koh as a federal judge. [16] [17] [18]ballotpedia.org"

"This continues to be the biggest pile of  in the semiconductor space and people don’t acknowledge this at all on this board. All they can do is give a thumbs down instead of admitting it’s been terrible off earnings. Down $25 from the 52 week high and people here think it’s not a problem? Their earnings were not that bad and furthermore, their forecast for this quarter was really good. What is hiding behind the curtain here for this to be down $25, because it’s just not supply constraints people, no way. This company has had a history of disappointing investors, and one has to wonder, if they’re such the 5G king, then what the hell is going on here? A forward PE of 19x when all other semiconductor stocks in this similar space are 24x-45x forward PE’s, Nvidia being the highest of course. The market doesn’t like this company, pure and simple. Oh, by the way, the S&P forward PE is 22.5X, so they can’t even get a real multiple. Can’t wait to sell this garbage once I make a little profit because this piece of  will never get a forward PE of even 25X, yet growing EPS at what, 25-30% y/y for the next few years? It’s not worth it if they can’t get an expanded multiple."

Hits $90 by tomorrow .
"Let me go back and see what all the rocket  scientists in here were calling for earnings & price targets hold please checking now, ROTFLMFAO I swear I read 100 posts claiming “$200 after earnings.”"
Will the possible stay if granted alter the stock price greatly still or will the future guidance alter any possible climb Q could’ve taken if granted a stay. In other words would the stay have less effect on the stock given the conservative guidance.
I’d rather see this trading flat then up 5% into the earnings call. They usually don’t carry that over to next day. So it’s better going in almost flat to report

Such an easy buy here.
"She's right, here's why. The spectrum was taken from US citizens, and sold to carriers like Verizon. They have to use it to the benefit of US citizens, since it was taken from us using a form of eminent domain laws, without our approval. In order to access the spectrum, you need CDMA. QCOM has a monopoly on CDMA, and if they use it to hold back a company trying to build a cheaper way to utilize the spectrum for the benefit of the American consumers, then QCOM is guilty. I'm pretty sure QCOM has done that, since they were sued by Apple and even some countries like China. QCOM is guilty here, and whether or not you agree with the judge, Trump, QCOM, or Huawei, doesn't make a bit of difference, what matters is that stock is in a nose dive, and you have to decide if you think they can win this. To me it looks like they can't win this."
"I am thinking going long, but then there is always a risk of trying to catch a falling knife. Also, not seeing anything positive upside on the horizon, so not sure what could be the catalyst for the stock to go when it is already up 50% in last 6 months."
QCOM IS 5G5 so if 5g is not over then qcom is in good shape. kink of like a new ipo growing so fast can't keep up and tends to have some lumpy quarters during the growth period.

Patience is the virtue. This is the only capable company to provide 5G ready chipset. No other competitor (Broadcom or intel) has it. No Chinese or Taiwanese fakes can catch up
buy and wait for next week news...
Just bought 2k shares... QCOM will be trading above $130 after next quarter report.
Maybe just maybe people are waking up to the fact the guy in the white house is just a walking corpse and others are running things...in to the ground.
LG may end up without a Q deal at all! What gets me is if Q is a monopoly why did Apple first go with Intel?
I need a 4x from QCOM in 5 years. Am I going to get it?
"QCOM in breakout pattern, load up old bag politician did"
Not sure that I’ve ever seen a company go down after receiving a 20% premium buyout offer. Wow.
Buy QCOM this is bottoming out. FTC lawsuit is a total bs. Remember QCOM was named a national champion. USA needs a strong QCOM.
Looks like we may see lots of green tomorrow
CEO sold huge chunk of stock. Does that mean Qualcomedy is about to going down to 60 again?
What was that volume spike at 1:30 today? Anyone know?
Opportunity to buy QCOM and TWST today is very rare! You will be very happy next week...
it's time to bring in some adult to the management team.
QCOM should go ahead with their purchase of NXPI regardless of what the Chinese are doing/thinking. They are misusing their regulatory bodies to get their way in a trade 'war'. Eight groups have said yes and the Chinese are looking for a payoff before saying yes.
"They're really shaking the tree's this morning, there are only 13 trading days (and I believe some of them are abbreviated) till the end of the quarter, so they're trying to shake out new investors that jumped in for the flash cash rather than the future, because they're not going to get any from those of us that held and added during the Covid decline.

$80s again. But for how long?
we should be north of 90 this week
some positive reading for the weekend with a bullish take on the NuVia acquisition: https://www.radiofreemobile.com/qualcomm-nuvia-flarion-ii/
"On Monday I thought Hock Tan would use the letter from the Treasury as an excuse to drop his bid for QCOM. The fact that he didn't makes me think that he must stand his ground and defend Broadcom. His business model is that of acquiring other entities, running them more efficiently and making them more profitable. The Treasury letter essentially says Broadcom isn't trusted by the U.S. Government, is not innovative, isn't a telecom leader, etc. How far can Broadcom get in the marketplace unless he can succeed in getting the U.S. Government to eventually approve of the Broadcom business model?The posts on this board and the Treasury letter that proclaim that QCOM is a crown jewel, etc. is all well and good but means nothing if it cannot be translated into a superior return for the owners of QCOM. The suggestion that those demanding superior returns are short sighted is ridiculous given the decade long underperformance. And from all I read 5G won't be mainstream until at least 2020 and the infrastructure requirements probably make that an optimistic view."
Looking the at the Volume of shares this looks like heavy shorting. Already 14 Mill shares vs average 8 mill per day. These dam shorts need one small reason and they start the games. Unfortunately riding up and down is the only manipulative way they make money. The power of wall street money and games never end. Small time retail investors have to bear the pain. Not sure where will they drive this to.
"Thanks for the gift, started positions again (two accounts) this morning. Good luck & great investing!"
Pleasant gift. My call is terrific now! It evolve
Vote them out only solution. Otherwise QCOM will go $50.
It's all because of uncerntainty in the next quarter. This quarter we all know it will be good and pretty much priced in.
Nothing has fundamentally changed. 5G just started and more QCOM chipsets and IP will be in demand. Why losing patience when QCOM is the only legitimate 5G player supporting all spectrum??
Folks never enter a stop loss number in your brokerage acct for any stock. They sell this info to drill team 6. They will use counterfeit shares and drill down to your stop. Then they will buy back at a much cheaper price. Always pul a sell limit at 10X the current stock price. This will scare off the shorties.
TIME TO BUY THIS BABE MORE SHARES.
shorts trying to take this down
price target is meant to be reached and broken ... so do expect Qualcomm to reach the price target soon
buy the dip!!!
I still have faith because 1) AVGO will soon be based in America and 2) there's still a whole lot of angry shareholders as shown by the ballots returned. There will be new mgmt soon.
in since 70 and enjoying the ride
"There are so many countries that now are declining to use China controlled company Huawie for 5G and QCOM is signing them up for 5G modem chips!! Looks like Huawie is getting push out, that is good news."

"Listened to SWKS earnings call. This company is banking big on 5G despite the short term downturn. Evidently QCOM has entered into RF 5G design competing with SWKS. When asked about this, SWKS responded that QCOM is a great company but will have a hard time competing with SWKS with decades of experience and expertise.

Now we have $50.2) Govt actions lead to China non-approval of qcom merger with nxpi.2) Govt says qcom is a great company and key to the 5g race yet Govt sues us.3) Govt says Huwaei is a national security threat, yet uses Huwaei as witness against the qcom, a key to the 5g race.4) Govt initiates tradewar, ensnaring qcom and many others.5) Govt indirectly helps aapl, a company exponentially larger than the key to the 5g race and who does most of its manufacturing outside the u.s., doesn't innovate and charges the average consumer $500-$1000 for a stinkin phone versus qcom, a co that is producing innovation to maintain our national security, win the 5g race and maintain our standing as a nation at the forefront of technology.What's wrong with this picture????"
"IMHO the ZTE deal is much more complicated than appears. Trump's comments to the contrary, our intelligence community is much more against further easing. And with the necssary xfer of very valuable IP to China, I hope QCOM's board thinks long and hard about giving up so much. Is it really worth it for QCOM to give away so much to China. Why isnt the 9 out of 10 EU/country approvals already received by QCOM enough?"
I picked up 3 shares hopefully they drives the price up
I see a deal coming up
It will be wise for both CO. to get together and come to an agreement rather than going to courts to solve it it. Both are great CO. and they need each other Apple should make the first step QCOM should open both armies and welcome them

QCOM a buy rating by ZACKS
".....Microsoft Invites Nextech AR to Showcase its Innovative, Cutting Edge Virtual Education Solutions at Its Global Education Partner Summit"
"Regarding Apples dispute with Qualcomm, ask yourself how much would you pay for an iPhone without Qualcomm's 3G/4G LTE wireless connectivity (i.e wifi only)? Now, subtract that number from $1,200 (i.e. the retail price of an iPhone) The remainder is the value added to the iPhone as a result of Qualcomm's LTE technology. If that number is greater than $17, (the cap on QCOM's royalty), then Apple is getting a great deal. Run the numbers yourself just to prove to yourself how rediculous Apple's position is. If it weren't for Qualcomm's 3G/4G LTE wireless connectivity, the iPhone would be little more than an ipod in search of a wifi connection !"
"Adding, QCOM -1% before ER."

Avgo has not much going in the way of innovation pipeline, it needs Qcom for its IP war chest that it does not have. Qcom has completed a RF product line with better cell phone integration which directly completes with Avgo’s bread and butter, and many non-iOS companies have already signed up.

"Buffet likes to say ""If it's close, it's going to happen"". Qualcomm's stock got within $1.05 of its all time closing price of 89.66. its high was today was 88.61. If that happens its all time high price of over $100 may be next as that would clearly be very close by then. Many people dont see it in their charts but that's a 20 year high!"
"Folks lets read the comments here together and use some common sense, OK!! Below comments about this Law suit.Apple has argued that its former supplier unfairly leverages its position as the biggest supplier of chips for smartphones to force payment of the fees. Qualcomm has countered that Apple is using its intellectual property without paying for it and the legal cases are aimed at forcing it to lower licensing charges.“Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm, said in a statement. “These court orders are further confirmation of the strength of Qualcomm’s vast patent portfolio.”SOME HOW APPLE thinks QCOM should just give away it ""IP"" to them Apple!! How Moronic can it get Apple wants free use of QCOM's hard work and IP.. Apple will lose this case once all of Apples Lawyers deplete their stall tactics. Mean time QCOM get shafted!! The action by China is proof Apple is wrong!! My question to Apple is hey send me a couple I-Phones free, I don't want to pay for them because you are unfairly leveraging your position as the biggest supplier of I-Phones, so send me my free phone!!! What kind of two bit defense is that to use for not paying for what belongs to QCOM!! Geeezzzzzzz!"

"Well at least Lucy said she will need to take her time on this one since it’s not a slam dunk. So who knows, maybe ir’s Not a done deal for the FTC after all."
Both FTC and Apple know Judge Koh is giving them time to work out a settlement w QCOM or else they will likely find ruling in favor of QCOM- a contract is a contract. Innovations and patents are worth little if royalties are not allowed to fund them. Intel might want to step in and grab QCOM while it is down in the gutter by offering 30% premium and work out a settlement w Apple on the sideline.Apple win-Intel win-QCOM win (from ruling loss threats and change its business model and structure ) and Judge Koh is off the hook to make this ruling.

"IMO - one more offer coming from Broadcom 1-2 weeks before Qcom's board meeting in March. $85-90/share, $70/share cash - but only if their director slate is selected - otherwise Broadcom will withdraw both offers. I imagine most shareholders will take this new offer rather than risk a potential 20% drop in the pps if Qcom's slate is voted in."

"Qualcomm Demands German Court Fine Apple for Continuing to Sell iPhones After BanThursday January 31, 2019 10:31 am PST by Juli CloverQualcomm today filed a motion calling for a German court to levy fines against Apple for not complying with a December import ban barring iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models from being sold in Germany, reports Bloomberg. According to Qualcomm, Apple failed to properly recall the banned iPhones from third-party sellers and continued to sell them in some Apple Stores in early January. Qualcomm in early January posted 1.34 billion euros in security bonds to enforce the ban, and Apple pulled its iPhones entirely from the country the next day. Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said that Apple ""intentionally"" defied the court order and continued to sell iPhones in some stores, and that the company ""obviously"" doesn't consider itself ""bound by the injunction."" ""Significant fines must be imposed to put a check on that,"" he wrote in a statement to Bloomberg. To prove Apple's non-compliance with the order, Qualcomm pointed towards a December press release that Apple has already been forced to retract. In the press release, Apple said that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models would be unavailable for purchase at its own retail stores, the devices would be available from carriers and third-party retailers. Qualcomm and Apple have been embroiled in an increasingly tense legal battle since January 2017. Qualcomm has thus far won sales bans on older devices in China and Germany, rulings that Apple is fighting against. Over the course of the last month, representatives from both companies were in a Northern California court for the Qualcomm v. FTC antitrust lawsuit. The FTC has accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive tactics to remain the main supplier for baseband processors for smartphones, an argument similar to Apple's. The Qualcomm/FTC trial wrapped up yesterday, and we are awaiting a verdict from the presiding judge, Lucy Koh, who also handled Apple v. Samsung.Tag: Qualcomm"
Another painful day
"a n o n, every single thing you post and every single thing you say for several weeks now has been hoping Qualcomm would drop in price. it's quite obvious that either you have no stake in the stock or probably a small short position. but the facts can't be hidden the stock sucks but the company has great technology. all you say on- things it's not that I don't agree sometimes it's just that you go to such a great effort to #$%$ on Qualcomm at every opportunity and frankly I'm not interested"

Fact - Apple makes it's own processors and is looking to take more of the semi content in-house as the news not long ago crashed dialog semiconductor; Samsung makes it's own processors and for the first time will be supplying the chip to an external customer; google makes it's own tensor processing unit and Tesla i believe recently started working on an in-house AI chip. Huawei just announced a chip capable of 5G and will likely move to supply Asia pacific at a lower price beating qualcomm. Who's left to supply? Broadcom on the other hand is great at acquiring so called profitable/unique franchises and turning them into long term cash cows and it rids of unprofitable business. A perfect match if you ask me; Broadcomm will monetize on qualcomm's ip and good franchises/technology and rid of waste.
"at this level its ALL politics. Qcom mngmnt has not aligned itself with the same greaseballs apple has. They have a 2 products 1 is intellectual, always paying for this if you want to be inthe game.

"May I ask someone who has access to Level 2, how the orders are looking."
"Notable quotes from a DJ article just out on the news wire:The U.S. made clear this week that containing China's growing clout in wireless technology is now a national-security priority. Telecommunications-industry leaders say such fears are justified -- but question whether the government's extraordinary intervention in a corporate takeover battle that doesn't even involve a Chinese company will make a difference.Many wireless executives and security experts don't consider Broadcom's takeover an immediate U.S. threat. But they believe the American government has legitimate long-term fears.Broadcom has also emphasized its Malaysian-born chief executive, Mr. Tan, and most of its board and senior management team are American. ""It's barely a foreign company now, but politics and logic aren't often friends,"" said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst. ""I'm just not convinced that Qualcomm's going to slash and burn the 5G roadmap and leave it open to Huawei"" if Broadcom buys"

MTK announcing 5G mmWave should actually be seen as a good thing for QCOM. This clearly means MTK sees demand for this technology in the markets they sell well and that is China.

In addition to qcom's legal matters, think about how long it took to drag ATT/TWX through the courts, and now Sprint/TMUS. I love that we live in a country of laws. But there should be some time boundaries.....not just whenever the courts feel like making decisions. Koh just presided over the trial - what's to ponder forever on the stay request???"

"I just keep loading, just like loading $SM months ago."
Up huge at conference call soon today...just bought more on dreaming cheap...
"Good morning good folks. I have said this several times on this board. Looking at the PE is useless with tech and high growth companies. Much better indicator for tech companies is the PEG. And the PEG of QCOM is 1.2. That is ridiculously low for a company like QCOM. Compare this to Apple, 2.67 and to NVDA. 3.91. And for a big laugh to Tesla, 8.46. QCOM by far is the cheapest tech play with huge potential upside in the most lucrative tech space that is 5G. Is like winning the trifecta people. This #$%$ (is the only way to characterize him, this or #$%$ that put out the forecast for Citi should be laughed at. Forget what he said about QCOM, anyone in here even bears think 5G has reach its peak? Seriously? In the market you are presented with a few moments like these to buy excellent companies with huge potential and minimum risk. This is one of them."
I'm wondering if the layoffs that QCOM announced and apparently are happening already reveal anything (source: employees). Why not wait until after March 6?
"Chad... hopefully there is further follow through, the powers we never see have had their thumbs on the scale long enough"
Earnings prediction everyone? Why is it dropping before earnings
OMG. Intel is also giving up developing 5G chips. QCOM truly is the leader here. Go longs.
"When Qualcomms comes through this 2 year assault on their IP business, they are going to be a different company. I would expect this company to make it its mission to combat Apple at every turn it can. Without Apple propoganda, government antitrust suits and foreign thievery of Qualcomms patents/IP, this company is a force in technology. Even if qualcomm has to negotiate down their IP cost to the brick manufacturor, They are still going to get a piece of everyone one of their 2,000 phones. Cook is cooked. Game over. Good try. Time pay all you owe."
Weak rebound today. Qualcomdey indeed
"Price targets raised to $120 at Raymond James, $125 at KeyBanc and $121 at Morgan Stanley. What say you Mr Goldman?"
No bad news about the company besides Apple making their own chips. I think Qualcomm is a buy.
Where’s green
This is a great company to own into 2020. So much going for it. Good luck all longs.!!
"This is where shareholders call to mind the primary responsibility of the Board - that of shareholder advocate. When many boards don't fulfill that very basic and clear responsibility, that's when shareholders become jaded, cynical, incredulous, skeptical, angry, etc etc. And they have every right to be. When the Board supports the CEO's claim that $82/share is not sufficient, even though it represents a SUBSTANTIAL premium over market value, that board damn well better have a plan to reward shareholders in the ensuing yr or two to the tune of something BETTER than $82/share. When they do the opposite, deliver a 30% reduction in shareholder's value, well what is more egregious than that???? It's astonishing that there isn't a law, a regulator, or anything else that severely discourages such behavior and therefore protects the shareholder. In other words, how the bleep is this allowed to happen?!?!?!"
slowly but sure going up
"I survived GME, this is nothing."
perfect buying OP. always buy dips in quality companies. the chip shortage isn't their fault. short term headwind out of their control. it also is affecting multiple other companies. this isn't qcom specific.
"Another question: In a previous news item, it was a judge's determination that qcom can pursue the right to exclude apple from the privilege of frand pricing. Isn't that huge? Or is it just that it's huge, but highly unlikely qcom could win that pursuit.Manfred and some of the other really informed posters....you guys are working overtime here! Thanks as always for your input."
"I checked, in detail, QCOM latest quarter as well as the forecast for the current, and the projections for volumes in 2018:- QCOM will deliver 800M 3g/4g SOC, ~45% market share- QCOM net earnings may easily reach $5B, assuming some, not all, the QTL disputes come to an end- QCOM has >$40B in cash and short term securities and ~$20B in debt with various maturityIf you put all this together, and totally ignoring NXPI, which in fact, due to the current situation with China, may not happen, and only based on sector comparable multiples, QCOM should be worth, right now, between $100B and $120B. The current market cap is $84B.So, shares should be in the $67 to $80. Let's take a middle figure of $73I have therefore decided, even if I have been badly hurt in the past 2-3 weeks, to gradually increase my shares. Inevitably, there will be some big drop but, ultimately, the value will emerge. Don't forget that QCOM has no real competitor in 5G SOCs and is making huge progress in various other areas, such as IoT, AI and data centers."
"Curious, is the onyl way qualcomm can bump up the stock price by buyback and acution and not via other new business expansion, innovation , new products etc. etc. Just think, they hoarded cash due to CDMA, 3g,4g. If that was not the case this would be dead by now. How long can they survive this way ?"
why is judge Koh taking so long to make a decision.....
who cares what wall street thinks anymore. good business long term. Buy on dips!
the volume last Friday was 25 million shares. was this the hedge funds exiting?
110% revenue growth is huge

"""The '674 patent, found to be infringed by Apple, improves power management in processor circuitry to reduce power consumption and improve battery life in mobile devices.

Bracing for impact when Q walks away and we are $2B lighter. We'll hit $50 before we see $60 again. This whole trade war is nuts.

"Lots of know it all people here try to scare us with correction overvalued etc. Know what I own. Modern life does not exist without chips and connectivity. And QCOM with others are driving the standards of the evolution 4g, 5g, 6g and onwards. The transformation is called 4th industrial revolution and our chips will be literary everywhere. It matters not what this is manipulated to do in the short term. Or what ignorant full preaches about the market. Know what I own."

"Lots of times you see disgruntled shareholders calling for a replacement of the BOD and CEO and most of the time this rant is misplaced. In the case of QCOM changes need to be made at the very top. The company needs to resolve the AAPL problem. What is the sense of buying stock, which will become high priced stock if this problem is not solved. This has been going on for almost two years now!"
Little Cupcake Cook is putting the spoon in the mix
Is this the big break out that will propel the stock over $100?
"Apple's motive could be a capacity play here.Apple has guaranteed production capacity at TSMC. If Qualcomm can't supply enough modems because it has supply capacity constraints at TSMC and Samsung, then it could be holding Apple back.If Apple moved the modem functions onboard the CPU, one major advantage would be the guaranteed production commitments at TSMC 5nm."
To me the future looks bright. Good time to be a long!
Why is this acquisition so suspiciously interesting?1 How does Apple get out of paying QCOM on its committed IP formula?2 How does Broadcom increase its market share with APPLE?3 Why was QCOM stock driven down just before the BroadCom offer?All answers lead to only one conclusion which IMHO is precisely why this all makes sense and that is why I am holding while hoping NXP is bought without raising the bid and that some of the current board members of QCOM are replace but not a majority. What is your view of why we are here at this point and please don't just say BECAUSE?
143-144 is a strong support which has been tested multiple times. Even in this two red days. Just about time

Dubbed the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule or DPR, Trump’s latest constraints have implications for China’s 5G rollout, for which Huawei is by far the dominant purveyor.The Trump administration has fired multiple salvos against Huawei Technologies Co. since the start of a campaign to derail China’s technological ascendancy. The latest blow threatens to cripple the country’s tech champion.“HiSilicon a division of Huawei won’t be able to continue its innovation any further until it’s able to find alternatives through self-development and collaboration with local ones, which will take years to mature,” said Charlie Dai, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. “We estimate that Huawei’s inventory of high-end chips (including baseband chips and CPUs for Huawei’s high-end smartphones) may last 12 to 18 months maximum.”"
170 tomorrow. Before earnings
Of all the semis in my watchlist QCOM is the only one in red. What a joke lol
maybe $80 next week—3rd week is a charm.
"The Qualcomm patents Portfolio forms the knowledge base of our nation’s telecommunications industry. Total access to these patents is absolutely a must for the development of the current and future telecommunications industry. Without these intellectual property, you don’t have a telecommunications industry. Economic well being of our industries is very much depends on these patents. These patents are priceless, and they should always be under the control of the inventors, in an American company, incorporated in America, operating under American laws. In the even these patents falls into the hands of a foreign company, operating under foreign laws, a denial of access to these patents would do catastrophic damage to our industries and the security of our nation. Therefore, Qualcomm ‘s ownership of these patents should be protected."
Don't forget my strong sell call on this with 120 target and support at 135. Enjoy !!
Have you noticed that QCOM/AAPL charts are almost identical except QCOM chart looks much better. Do the charts comparison on Yahoo and you will love it!

Yet apple does not want to pay license fee to qualcomm. Only difference is software to hardware, but basically same thing. Apple is 800 pound guerrilla and qualcomm 40 pound chimpanzee, basically apple is crying that qualcomm is taking too much. Who is bully who? Apple is trillion company and qualcomm just 1/10 the that and apple is using thier dominate power to avoid paying license fee which apple has agreed to pay for qualcomm innovation."

Broadcom’s offer price is reasonable but we are creating all of these shenanigans and theatrics as a last ditch effort to keep our cush jobs, fat paychecks all the while leeching off of qcom shareholders.Guys the choice is clear keep us in."
I have decided if it goes down then I will buy for sure because next year is good for qcom ..dont look at short term
"THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT QCOM IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPANIES FOR THE 5G AND THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY OUTLASTED MOST OF THEIR COMPETITORS , THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUITY TO OWN A TECH COMPANY THAT HAS A GREAT DIVIDEND YIELD"
QCOM is gold
I got call options on this but I should have bought a share so I could vote blue. It's a win win. If this deal doesn't go through there might be a public hanging afterwards.
If it hits $146.... then does that break a key support level? Wow... it is getting beat up big time!
"Such an overreaction....take the emotions out people....look at their income statement, balance sheet, customers and long -term growth. If you sell, I'm buying more as this won't last under 150 much longer"
Some of you saying this will not go over $185 well..... it will 
"Stimulus package is coming, see you at $200"
What just happened? It lost $1 in the last hour??
I have the solution to all of this M&A and patent stuff. Broadcom has a GREAT relationship with Apple and also has lots of cash.....so Broadcom (AVGO) buys QCOM and NXPI and the Apple issue gets immediately resolved thru Hock Tan. Problem fixed....I'll send you my bill. :)
Now this is too strange. They doubled their profits year over year. So I bought
Honest to God I have a great feeling regarding the chip sector. But yes emotions should not be part of the investment strategy. The strategy should be realistic and calculating. But if you look at our technological infrastructure nothing runs without the chip aka semiconductor . You can also buy a great mutual fund such as FSELX etc with Qualcomm as a major holding. Then continue your regular (monthly biweekly etc) investments and relax and watch it grow
More exc comp ?????? Exc's DO YOUR JOB .. MAKE APPLE PAY UP .
what a discount for a great company

"Numerous litigations with their own customers, on their way to add Broadcom as another enemy, announced big wave of employee layoff, lack of intent to satisfy shareholders. Must be nice to be alone in the world, QCOM board!"

2018 is gone..we have to wait 2019 and pray..this is not the QCOM year
I think QC is an a good position with 3 possible paths:1. Wait out the appeal2. Plan for a possible spin of QTL. This has been pondered for years as Spinco. QC needs this in their back pocket if ruling is upheld/. QC shareholders get a piece of the pie from the spin.... regardless the outlook is not that bad.... No one in the world can complete against the QC R&D and long term roadmap...3. If appeal stands Raise Chipset prices and renegotiate a 2% royalty. Nothing lost..
Do you guys ever read (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just wrote about QCOM
yikes.... might have to adjust my bullish position based on this reaction
"I will be honest. I have always been naive and fairly stupid. However...when I was younger, I was much more naive and fairly stupid. Back then, I had saved up some money while serving in the Army and during a couple of combat tours in Iraq. I got out...and I figured I needed to invest that money well. At the time, I wasn't sure exactly what to do. I know this sounds weird...but, I believe in signs, fate, destiny...whatever you want to call it. I lived nearby ""Qualcomm Stadium"" in San Diego. (I don't know if that exists anymore) I took that as a sign. I did my research and determined QCOM to be a good company to invest in at the time. I mean, a stable tech stock with a high yield?...it sounded pretty good. I think I bought in at 50 bucks or so...something like that. This was years ago. I've held it ever since. I've held it through the multiple international litigation disputes. I've held it through the potential Broadcom deal. I've just hung on to it and have been confident in it. It is a good, well-managed company. This stock has spiked a lot recently. I am sure that most experts would tell me to sell and cash out while I can. But, I don't want to. The PE is low, the business is solid, the yield is great, 5G is going to be revolutionary,...and on and on. This stock is undervalued in my opinion. I do not have a crystal ball and I cannot see into to the future. But, I think this stock has room to run and has a solid future. For every one negative, I can think of 99 positives regarding it. I have been long and I intend to remain long. Heck, I might add to my position if it dips low enough."

You can’t be. Married to stocks. When the news is bad you need to move on. Plenty of investments out there. Qcom is dead money for now. Apple said they will be making their own. chips. Apple is 60% of Qualcomm business.

"Qualcomm: Why The Success Story Just Begins (via Seeking Alpha)- Qualcomm has a favourable valuation compared to the peer group and is fundamentally undervalued despite the share price rally due to the Apple settlement.- In addition, there is a pending share buyback program of around $7.8 billion and the dividend of currently over 3%, which also speak for an attractive shareholder value in the future.- The 5G generation in mobile communications is currently in the roll-out phase, so that it can be assumed that profits and cash flows will increase in the foreseeable future.- Now that the license dispute with Apple has been settled, Qualcomm can focus almost entirely on its operating business.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4255620-qualcomm-success-story-just-begins?mod=mw_quote_news"

"Remarks on postponed ITC decision reg. possible import ban of certain IPhones in the US. I think, it’s known, that the ITC found an infringement of Q patent 5,535,490 reg. battery life improvement. However, the judge decided not in favor of an import ban, as public interest weighs against it. The ITC will review the judge‘s decision. In focus of the investigation of the Review will be: how long would it take Apple to design around the infringed patent ? What National Security concerns would be implicated by a sales ban and whether a limited import ban could be adopted. The ITC wants to also understand better Intel’s Position reg. 5G, in case an import ban is spoken out. The investigation of the ITC should have been finished Jan 29. Government Shutdown may have an influence on the durance of the investigation, as final decision of the ITC tribunal was postponed to late March. After all, the most important question from a practical perspective could be, if a workaround of the above mentioned patent is possible easily or not. If somebody has a technical expertise, would be great. Apart from that, I think the ITC tribunal will overrule the initial decision not to impose an import ban. In case you are interested in links, I will give some on Twitter #ftcqcom. Best of luck"

"There is no need to talk about the best stock for 5G right now, because it is only QCOM that stands tall by itself. It will be even better when spring comes in. In Asia, Huawei already plants its seed in Asia, that include India. China and India, Huawei did it but QCOM has all the smart phone companies sign the contract to use QCOM chipset. SUMSUNG, and HUAWEI will use QCOM chip, yes Huawei also uses QCOM chip too. PIXEL already puts QCOM chipset this spring. So I have no doubt that QCOM will go even higher, I guess we will see QCOM OVER 100 SOON."

Good news for Qcom on CIFiUS JV authority. Anybody who knows the history of Qcom in China would understand why. China no longer allowed to steal. They can either pay or get left behind. Of course if they choose to get left behind then Qcom loses out a bit there. But I’ll take that all day to see U.S. flourish and China flounder.
"Bummed about the dip, but bought another leap call at a 3 month low. Thanks QCOM."
"We need an Emoji for this one!! Just have to do it!! Lets face it she is ""Hot""!!"
"actually got in at low of day, 145.90.. first time that ever happened"
Buying opportunity... I kinda get little greedy times like this...
I guess we kinda have to somewhat keep an eye on Apple earnings. Maybe a settlement is in the works and qcom is trying to get ahead of it.
Will buy more on retest of $63
What’s 167 - 134? $33 so QCOM DOWN 21% since earnings with zero chance of a rebound
"Do your homework. Over 8,000 of the March 55 calls have traded so far today. Someone really thinks we go higher."
“If we can make more we can sell more” so you are having supply issue? Thanks for buying base in “futures “ my puts will print tomorrow!
I smell 90 Tomorrow
Qualcomm will win against Apple. In five years Qualcomm market cap is higher than Apple market cap.
"How in the world does (SWKS) beat earnings and we miss? OK! insiders or market manipulators, you really think I'm going to sell my shares, so you can turn around and buy the dip. And than 2 weeks later pump it back up pass the 175 price point. I been there and done that. To wise now for these fools. Please folks do not listen to analyst at all, do your own research and use your wisdom. I can't tell you how much in thousands I have lost listening to these morons. I ignore them 100% of the time and its working."

"Looks like a few big players are going in a buying large amounts of stock. This stock keeps going green quickly after being in deep red,,,,,,,,,,"
Is it possible that this could be a move in this financial chess game between Qualcomm and Broadcom or am I giving the board too much credit.
"TTOO For a trade, tomorrow will be $3.25"
What about the 3 day Rule for buying after a correction?
They beat earnings but by small margin. So Wall Street hate it :( sad day dude
"I bought @150 & @146 + 20 calls ""QCOM Mar 19 2021 160 Call...."""
As the guy from Bernstein said looks so dubious. It will s more national interest than national security. Same way as tariffs were national security with canada
This is the beginning!5G is the future and QCOM is definitely the leader.BTW . 5G is short wavelength and transmission is to shorter distance = more antennas.
Bullish Pattern Detected
If your selling Qcom today your gutless and will be rightfully punished tomorrow
"Seel this for now and get into the fight, NOK tomorrow will be one of the heaviest traded companies that you will see, make that money and hold, it is going to fly, every share will be bought."
"$52 is better than $79. Happy now, trumptards?China will likely decline acquisition of Nxp by Q, in response to LyingTrump."
"There is a short duration nice cup forming, recently it happened twice and sp went higher each time. Look for couple of days for the handle and it will run up again."
"Any idea why QCOM was down today while NVIDIA and AMD were up? All 3 have similar eps growth forecasts for this year and NVDA and AMD have forward PEs of 46 and 51, compared with QCOM's 21"
As I said do not short before earnings
QCOM still the only game in town for 5G CHIPS !!!
79 is helluva bit better than 60 (which is where this is going soon)
glad I bought at 157and the scare at 141.. main core at 75
a lot of puts out there
Are we going higher?
Sell sell sell! Then I can buy more
would you guys honestly take $70 now from another company? or even $67/share ? I sold all my shares around $62-66 last time around with the AVGO fiasco. If I buy it would be below $54.
This was on Cramer's list to buy this week into weakness
qcom really won here and they deserve to be at 100$ to be back w/o even counting other side revenue that they r doing now
This share price is just a product of manipulation of the market. All you hear is 5g this th that yet even though earnings were decent imo someone or something sold this stock off or shorted it merely because they could. At this point its just ridiculous and frustrating. Once this maRket moves higher its time to get out of the stock market. Retail investors go to bed and wake up the next morning and the market sells off based on what?? What has changed with QCOM??? Nothing??

130 is coming
"I think many people were ok w/ qcom not getting the nxpi deal, considering the buyback that they'd do and the fact it looks like they'd have overpaid for nxpi. I was pretty much ok w/ either outcome and looked forward to some clarity for the company. But as I see nxpi down four bucks today, it sure looks like this deal isn't happening, and so I'm fearful for what it means for the larger issues of trade war, effect on the market at large etc. Scary stuff."
qcom going crazy ....this is nothing when they will report ER..it should touch 180 after ER!
Beautiful bounce back. Will double my position for earnings and hold for the year :) still has a lots to give
AAPL will settle and send the stock to 90
"This stock is screaming ""Buy the dip!"""
Broadcom bid for Qcom was 117 billion... they r probably crying now they shouldve been way more generous! Ah well too late now.. Qcom needs no one!
CNBC Live: Qualcomm awardes exec team stcok bonuses- Steve Mollenkopf: 40k shares
"was hoping to add more on the dip today, but actually, this is better. lol"
Qcom. 130. Yes sir.
recovering fast
overall market is going down
Time to step in
Very low volume while going up.. there are no more sellers!!
Watch for Shorts Squeezed in the afternoon hours.STRONG BUY!
I think Qcom should win this case easily
"Explain this to me: QCOM closes at $72+ yesterday, opens at $70, and goes back to $72+. Hey, I'm glad it's maintaining $72, but talk about irrational behavior!"
TI forcast brings down Qcom...maybe the Chinese biz is going to Qcom and not TI???????
will this prices hold till morning
screaming buy here. PE 25. stock price helping market makers clean house. options expire worthless catching everyone off-balance. 75% qcom owned by hedge funds so not manipulation by hedge funds. market overreacting. when everyone thinks something will happen and doesn't watch out.
Financial management continues to be horrendous at this company. It's hard to believe but we would have all been better off if Broadcom had acquired QCOM.
The only thing that could save us all is if the Reddit users made QCOM their new GME.
"Trump is doing the right thing.Huawei's company name stands for fighting for Chinese people. Huawei's network equipment not only poses back door, but they will not let other brands to interoperate, meaning blocking any US made deivces to be sold in the future. 5G technology is a war.Although it is painful to investors, it will pay out in long term."
FYI: check Benzinga; The AnalystAnalyst Matthew Ramsay upgraded Qualcomm from Market Perform to Outperform and increased the price target from $64 to $80.
"the move is not because Apple purchase, but because of ""strong support of BIG US techs to Trump's Huawei ban"""
So okay the stock gets hit because they can't make chips fast enough. That tells me they are doing pretty damn well. Adding now!
Qualcomdey shows up
Volume for Qualcomm is not there to propel the stock higher. I set my Buy to Cover at $144.00... easy money . Next week we’re going to have a major pullback in the markets with the election  problems that we’re having just watch !
Interesting read. https://www.criterioninnovation.com/download/?id=1260
semi's up big qcom not. bad way to start with new administration
"Aapl: so we didnt infringe in any pattents but in case we did, it was ours engineer’s creation...Whattttt"
Just a little afternoon profit taking...... (Not that there is anything wrong with that....)
Patience ! It will go down near term... Wait til end of next week for bottom around $125
i sold SHOP and bought QCOM....hope i made the right decision :-)
qcom will be at 110 in 2 years.

"So does qcom actually start renegotiating contracts based on Koh's order in order to comply up and through 10/4, or do they sort of get a temporary stay while appeal pending. Legal eagles where r u?"
Lol company beat the estimate its just not that aggressive.
Take off.
Huawei's does need qcom but if china goes full blown trade war they will make their own cdma chips without paying q just like the crooks at that unamerican company apple
$150 today????
"buy buy buy , it is just a temp thing , the company is strong , pre market might be down but it will go up in the future"
I think QCOM is over not 5G is over.
"Well I knew something was going on by yesterdays price action. Steve Mollenkopt stepping down. I guess he was burned out from a lot of issues that he navigated the company thru. The good news another hand picked Engineer is taking his place. We will miss Steve and wish him all the best! He was batting a thousand!Mollenkopf, 52, steered Qualcomm into a lucrative settlement with Apple Inc. AAPL that ended a settled a two-year legal battle over royalties owed on the sale of iPhones and other devices featuring Qualcomm's intellectual property. He also beat the U.S. Federal Trade Commission allegation in 2019 that Qualcomm abused its market dominance in the market for semiconductors that connect modems and smartphones, where licenses earn the San Diego-based company around $5 billion a year. For the record Steve beat the FTC and Lucy Koh, some moron for CNBC wrote that he did not. I don't know how dumb anyone who follow this knows the FTC ruling was over turned. Some Cramer fake news!"

Less revenues and earnings than TSLA. Not just most recent quarter but also next quarter. No way this stock is with $92 billion in market cap with declining forward revenues.

its another great day
Why Zacks tries their best to cut down Q in many ways? It seems they got pay to do that
Next year revenue will hit all time high and so buy the dip in long term basis.
People whining this stock is going down. It's as though they only live in the present and have no sense of past or future. Such an obvious buy here.
$130-$140 by end of year???
"Since Qualcomm went public in September 1991, QCOM stock has hit $80 on six occasions: January 2000, March 2014, March 2019, June 2019, September 2019, and October 2019. On every time but the last, Qualcomm stock retreated to below $80. I sold the stock at $91 simply because I do not think Stupid Steve Mollenkopf is a good CEO. He had years to negotiate a reasonable deal with Apple. Yes, Apple lost the short term battle with QCOM, but will this will eventually hurt Qualcomm when their agreement ends in a few years. When Apple bought the 5G unit from Intel, I knew Qualcomm over played its hand. Apple will soon have their own modem to go along with their own processors. Yes, Qualcomm could rise to over $100, but I think smart money sell on the next rise past $90."

"I think the stock is priced for a stay of Koh’s decision. That means the stock won’t budge if the stay is granted by either court. if either court doesn’t grant the stay, the price could go south sharply. If Trump or Congress is to act to save Q, then they need to step in before Koh’s order goes into effect immediately and Q has to start granting licenses to chipmakers and renegotiating licenses to OEMs. As an investor, the sweet spot will be after the 9th Circuit denies the stay and before Trump steps in to save Q. The window wont’ be open very long, so be ready to buy."

"Think Apple must have reimbursed Qualcomm over $15 billions....and they will be paying $7,50 per phone in future."
Money flows into QCOM for 5G hype from all around the world. Sit tight until the biggest long term surge we have ahead.
I'm pretty sure QCOM will hit 110 this year and may break out surging like 1999. History repeats itself.
Buying now is buying at the bottom guys!
I bought 600 shares last night after hours @152.15!
QCOM's reaction is quite telling.....Offer price is to low and there is too much regulatory risk/uncertainty. This sets the stage for QCOM to sell only the Chip division (QCT) and keep the Licensing biz (QTL). This results in a much more affordable deal for BRM and significantly reduces the regulatory risk for both parties.
They need a bee and improved PR. DepArtment
Qualcomm Gets Price-Target Hike As Handset Makers Buy Its High-End Chipshttps://www.investors.com/research/ibd-industry-themes/qualcomm-power-integrations-smartphone-chips/
Looks like a triple top failed breakout at 75 to me. At least Mollenkopf and rest of the management team keep getting rich while long term shareholders suffer.
"this is a $300 stock, 5ggggggg and EV"
"Next big news announcement for QCOM could be that it is building specific chipset for smartphones to recieve wifi from Elon's Starlink. Heck, why not just have Nokia and Qualcom merge to build Starlink smartphones as well. Nokia needs to fold and become one with another company, they are sucking wind now."
The CEO is MIA cause he knows that his 5G technology patents will be defended by the Trump administration for national security reasons.
new 52 week high we are going to 75 woohoo
Look at the strength. Do you see what this stock has endured this week?
$GSAT is so undervalued right now! 5G contracts coming in fast! Don’t miss out! #CTRM #TNXP #AMC #NOK #QCOM #BLU
QCOM will grow faster than AAPL from here if you look at their charts....
Eventually Apple will just buy Qualcomm
any short squeeze will take this to 200 soon
BUT THIS! GUYS!!!
"Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: BRCM) offer for buying out Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) may prove bad news for Qualcomm’s NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ: NXPI) bid. Qualcomm is getting a $70 per share offer. Broadcom will need to raise the bid to thwart the NXPI buyout and successfully acquire Qualcomm. Qualcomm is in a tricky spot. Shareholders will demand at least $80 a share from Broadcom. But NXPI shareholders want more, too. If NXPI senses it can get more, it could break from the deal, leaving Qualcomm more vulnerable to Broadcom. QCOM and NXPI shares are ultimately undervalued even with the pending buyouts. But under Broadcom, the consolidation would likely protect the royalty rates and give the bigger company more negotiation power over Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). For now, Apple’s complaint over Qualcomm’s royalty rates could cut costs for the iPhone supplier if the courts rule in its favor. NXP would owe $2 billion to Qualcomm if it tries to break from the deal before April 2018. A failure to get regulatory approval would leave NXP with no fees owed. More likely is that Apple’s case against Qualcomm will not hold up in court. Apple is ultimately looking for better royalty rates for 5G. If Qualcomm prevails, QCOM stock is worth $90 or more and Broadcom’s bid will be seen as opportunistic and timely."
wait it out - great company holding keys for the future
"if Qcom abandons chips/ modem biz and raises the price on royalty to the previous levels, will that wipe out the difference lost with the new lower royalty rate per unit?"
will the price surge after the earnings call?
It is very unusual the delay of the dividend announcement ! Any guessing ?May be one time dividend payment? Could be an acquisition ? May be an increase in shares buyback?
has the dispute settled on the courthouse steps before trial begins soon this morning?
This is not the right place to invest your hard earned money.Next stop is $130.
Very aggressive and over reaction from wallstreet for small miss.. Everyone missed or overlooked exponential revenue jump from previous earnings. I am long with QCOM .
"QCOM is desperately trying everything it can, including seeking help from Senator Cornyn. So they talk a good game saying wanting to negotiate and at the same time playing sneaky games."
"QCOM + NXPI is worth around $90. Broadcom knew it but Hock Tan already maxed out their leverage at $79. He offered $82 w/o NXPI since he can use QCOM 37B to pay for the deal. Now, he have to reduce cash offer since that money is gone to NXPI purchase. $105B company want to purchase $130B or even $160B does not make sense. Let vote white to get our $90 within a year or less."
"Bought more at 84.30, very long long term"
Supply lower than demand. My TP up to $190... GoGoGo
Good buy opportunity for many and this dip won't happen so often since I am buying and will keep it for a long time!

"I thought we had hit the bottom at $148 in afterhour yesterday. But the fact the market makers are pushing ito down to $146 this morning, that's causes concern for me. It seems to me that the market makers are offloading their position for next couple of quarters hence the continued decline."

Seems like INTEL is doing QCOM a favour
Split coming??
what happens to Qualcomm stock holders if Broadcome buys them? I own both but much more of Qualcomm. How are the shares handled?
"To keep today's earns is perspective, consider that compared to AVGO Qualcomm makes ~ 35% higher revs and ~ 85% higher net income; compared to NVDA the numbers are 80% on revs and ~ 85% on net income. Don't even mention AMD. Yet its market cap is ~ 90% of AVGO and ~55% of NVDA. And Q's new businesses auto and RF are surging. Lots of room for appreciation, particularly with this temp pullback."

"@sataar Cheers!! Cant wait for the earnings call thats when we will find out how much Apple will pay up front for the delayed royalties, and specially what Qcom will do with the money... More buyback? Special dividends? Pay down debt?! Anyways it will be hard to short this or buy puts for a while thank god.Also we will find out how many contracts for its 5g chips were signed at DES and Q1. I counted 30!!!EPS guidance will increase more than the $2.Remember with Intel dropping 5g, Qcom will be the only western (USA, Europe, South America) manufacture of 5g chips. Its chips will be used for wearables, IoT, streaming, gaming, selfdriving cars, virtual glasses, healthcare, manufacturing and etc.On top of all that earphones for Alexa, Apple tv and etc... Also AI chips for data centers...Future looks really bright. Target price should be $154 in one year. Simple math P/E of 22 and eps $7.Important to remember also that Qcom made $30 billion buyback with avr price of $60... So lets thank management that were insulted by short minded newbie investors!!!"
Bullish
cramer just said qcom will be back but Cramer is right about SWKS bc swks has own foundries to make their own chips
shares touch $70 and 7% would be 74.90 and that is less than the 9% premium the company offered previously. At 9% the stock would be 76.30. poor guys who sold at 67.50 know wonder the option with 90 strike price are super active. This stock can blow up in the next day and hit $80 easily
Over. Reaction! QCOM should 20% return profits 2021!
Earnings will be great tomorrow....hold on boys and girls....$100/share coming soon!

Apple just inferred on call that their I phone business will be trending above seasonal growth this next quarter!!!!!!
"Folks it is interesting we have some new big mouth bashers on our board today. I guess when Intel went up a buck and halve ($1.50)they thought they hit the big time!! What a joke, soon they will be on Mute!"
Where’s the pre announcement.
"https://mlexmarketinsight.com/db_images/special-reports-pdf/Qualcomm-FTC-Report-Final.pdf Unbiased, full of info. From Twitter #ftcqcom. It’s a lot but helps tremendously to follow the whole conflict..."
"Longtime shareholder of QCOM. Hope they stay independent and work out something for NXPI. Correct me if Im wrong, but isn't roughly 65% of Qcom stock held by ""Institutional Investors""? That might tell u something!!"
"All fine...but the markets up for the last 3/4 days, with results not bad at all,yet qcom lost $20 . Whith analyst research mostly unchanged to higher......what to think?"
We must not assume that the Apple QCOM deal was 100% in favor of QCOM. Most likely it t was a compromise. I own both stocks.
rulings in China and Germany were in QCOM'S favor. this Judge is of Korean descent and she just made an extremely harsh ruling against qualcomm in favor of Korean competitors
"I’m counting on QCOM to go up at least 9% after the earnings call Wednesday. Apple is allegedly less innovative, and Q whipped Apple in litigation, so Q should exceed a 9% price rise."

"Qualcomedy fall down, go BOOM! "
Starting to think QCOM might be a dog with fleas...lots if fleas.
"""Qualcomm's Smartphone Chipset JV Gets the Nod in China: - Is this a precursor to the QCOM-NXPI deal?"
pure manipulation
"In my view today's news-free move is an intra day speculation by the guys who believe today they can earn more (on J.Powell's allegedly optimistic testimony and 3k S&P) in another shares having high beta and no uncertaincies around. Hope I am right, but if I wrong, then OK."
Per is still over 32. Super overvalued
QCOM and MRNA are 2 of a kind from here guys! I have been watching QCOM for last 4 sessions and decided to buy it today.
Great. Now stuck with the worse management in the tech industry.
Not a bad price to load up on this communications titan.
believe it or not without these chips . technology is nothing
Interesting that AVGO is running way up today in a down market ahead of the weekend and the upcoming vote.
is it a good time to buy? I read they are still thinking of going private. What would that mean if I was a shareholder...
option expiry date...hedgeFunders taking advantage
People even apple is down evening after that mind boggling earnings report. I watch this stock go from low 100's to 160 in 8 weeks and there are people complaining. Rome wasn't built in a day. Maybe for daytraders but not investors 
The volume is so low today. Very good potential
See u guys at $150 middle of summer. Time to buy.
What’s to stop Huawei from reverse engineering Qcom’s or xlnx chips and use them for their market only? What can these companies do about it? We have been dealing with a Rouge Regime for over 40 years. Remember The Tiananmen Square Massacre. Of 1989?
What is going on by the big boys is the reverse of Robinhood and Reddit bunch.They have to project a false picture! Drive out the newbies and weak hands!!The next step is pick up the cheap shares! A blind man should be able to see this!!
This and $QRVO have another 10% to drop AT LEAST. Perhaps 15%. They got PUMPED and OVERHYPED and failed to pass the test. Enjoy!
And now we wait. Good luck to all longs !!!
Intel gonna buy this now?
"Gap open tomorrow forming an ""Island bottom"" looks really bullish to me..than retest or blow through to new hi"
$200 getting close.. and still cheaper than nVDA and amd and AAPL.
"This gets pounded no matter what, red day, green day, doesn’t matter "
Seems like offer is accepted !!!!! Total will be $110
a lot of powerful groups all over the world tries to bite off the deliciosus 5G cake made by Q. let them do it by selling your piece while I will definetely stay and see how it comes in the end.
"Simple question - why is qcom delivering ""ANY"" chips to Apple as they are behind on their payments?"
get the dip
Why is Q taking a hit today?
The trend is your best friend!
"Since we’re in a bubble, when companies are overvalued like this, earnings/forecasts have to be better than this or the stock has to come down. Valuations are sky high right now, I’m hoping for $120-$125 next week. We’ll see..."
this will blow up to $91 today or more
Where is the new ceo
Back to 160 by March 1.
We may have a shot at 150 today. Especially since the futures are way up for the entire market.
everyone waiting to buy at the open
"I guess you make the national security argument when you have nothing else to keep the status quo which has been two decades of wealth destruction. Even the January CIFIUS request has unintended consequences of poking a stick in the side of Chinese who you need to complete NXP. And to do this all behind the backs of the shareholders who were already about to vote you out only stoked that fire. Remember, the very large shareholders are politically connected as well and they just saw an $82 offer trading at $62 ... No one wants to wait for a promised pay day from these deplorable, self serving Q management and BOD ..."
"In 2 years when QCOM is still trading in the $60s, we're going to hear from management ""just wait until the incredible opportunity of 6G"""
