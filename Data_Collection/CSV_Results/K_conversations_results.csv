"So what I'm gathering is that Kellogg's sold a few of its non-core assets to consolidate and prioritize their growth strategy, which includes capitalizing on growing dietary and lifestyle trends with healthier foods and sustainable farming, while also acquiring businesses in developing economies to target emerging market growth.The dip is a direct result of marginally reduced operating profits from the divestiture and lower short term guidance. They're investing elsewhere in both operating facilities, businesses and product innovation, they're seeing organic sales growth in most geographical regions. They're still a profitable enterprise and making moves to try and secure themselves for the future.Our global population is continuing to grow and we will only have more mouths to feed, I'll take a nibble at this stock when it dips over SHORT TERM outlook and then I will hold it over the LONG TERM for the dividend income.Disclaimer *I'm just an amateur retail investor, don't take my words for financial advice*"

"Here is why I voted for President Trump on Nov. 8, 2016. I lost my job in 2010 when Obama let all the H1-2 Visa people from India and Pakistan into the USA who took all the IT jobs in Wauwatosa Wisconsin Company for lower pay and I had to train the new person in my job before I got my severance package. Obama was a total disaster as President for me and many people I worked with who also lost their jobs. Could be why Trump won Wisconsin a normal Blue state just like Michigan. I will vote for Trump again in 2020 he is making America great again just like he promised. Stock market is more proof it closed today at a new record high."
breitbart pooped on this company big time.
Kellogg’s is good. Staying in for good

Yes Obama told the biggest 2 lies of any President in History. If you like your health insurance and Doctor under Obamacare you can keep them. He told the lie 26 times on TV and the liberal media gave him a free pass.
another missed opportunity for K?? Taco Bell announced a deeper partnership with Beyond Meat today. I liked the announcement of the partnership with Dunkin Donuts early last week but... K is moving glacially slow with these partnerships compared with the competition.

"House Democrats like Nancy Pelosi what windfall tax on retirement accounts so they can redistribute the money to illegal aliens and unemployed poor and are also taking aim at State retirement plans for workers who have none, including California's model plan that is a joke.Here is a primary example of the Out of touch Democrat Party chipping away at anything that is beneficial for the working man and woman. Absolutely disgraceful. (Remember - Liberal democrats are the ones who are always shouting ""State's Rights!""). Nancy Pelosi wants to redistribute your retirement gains to people who have no retirement. She senile or insane?"

VOTE OUT ALL DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT!!!POLITICS HAVE NO PLACE IN THE MARKET!!!
i am officially short and told my kids that we wont stop eating Kellogg.they did not like it first but once i explained the situation they understood and will deal with itenough is enough i fight liberalism wherever i can since it does not make sence
I in at 57$ I think this is one of the best value stocks to have in portfolio right now
It’s pretty funny how K and GIS pretty much own most of the products I buy in wegmans from pringles to eggo to progresso and yet the stocks trade at a steep discount to the overall market. 15x earnings. 3+% dividends. Simple inflation protected businesses and yet all anyone wants to do is catch the falling knives in the biotech and tech names. At some point the reopening trades end and if you’re patient today I’d imagine the safety stocks like K and GIS and TR take the baton from the reopening stocks
I would sure sell any kellogg stock before their 4th quarter report. The boycott is going hit their earnings big time. I used to buy kellogg's products before I realized they were anti America!
Kellogg Company & MTV hate's White America. Why spend your Money's on company's who hate you and your family
"Be savvy use your reason, respect your hard earning dollars. Kelloggs is overvalued, KO is not going to buy out Kelloggs at it's current very high valuation. it is far overpriced KO management is far to prudent then this, they have a reputation to maintain they are not going to pay far more for any company they acquire then it is worth. As well K is desperately trying to uplift sales, this is not a company KO would buy, until they see a turnaround plan potentially working. As well if an agreement was being discussed the Kelloggs Trust would not be selling shares as they just did, 8,000,000 million dollars worth. K also has very high debt of 7.9 billion approx meaning financing a buyout would be challenging. Plus the Kelloggs Trust I believe the largest shareholder would be an obstacle to buying K."
President Trump approval today 51% In spite of liberal fake news hammering him every single day

"Again the same talk on this board. It is like a venting board for longs and shorts. This reminds me of the internet days where everyone was trying to get there two cents in. I love it when there is good talk and informative talk. But when the venting comes it is really just out of hand. There is know one who knows OPKO's destiny. Whether it fails and trades to the 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1. I read threw a couple of smart cats on this board and then can't believe they post all day about doomsday. The doomsday you all should be thinning about is where this country is going to be in 4 years from now after the election. Dr. Frost has made mistakes. But I would love to have his money. So people can bash all they want about HIM, not the stock, and wonder what it would be like to have unlimited funds to spend. Have you ever passed his home on the water in Florida? The biggest blunder he made with OPKO was to obtain BRLI. It diluted this stock very badly. Very badly. But OPKO will get pass that, bash all you want and possibly have a great future. What is one of the biggest things you learn in investing? That losses are on paper. If the stock has traded down to levels of the past, paper loss. I feel as I have said before that OPK is trading where it should be. It got out of hand. Without there own revenue from drugs that may be approved, it will sit here. With 600M shares OS, it will sit here. As I have said before, if you where long and made a good trade at higher prices, great. If you where short and made a good trade then great. Who the F$$K cares about anything else. We invest and trade. Hold long or short. And are all in it to make MONEY. So I say good luck to everyone and I mean it."

"Kellogg's is well positioned for the evolving consumer dietary trends with a large variety of plant based offerings, Morningstar, Kashi, etc. etc.. They have shown an ability to innovate and made divestment and acquisitions to target revenue growth as well. Compared to the current valuation of consumer defensive stocks like PEP, MDLZ, PG, etc., I think that Kelloggs is one of the best options to buy right now."
Kellogg reached a 52 Week high at 72.28

"For those who think the company is an acquisition target worth several-fold the current valuation, I have a very simple four-part question that nobody is willing to answer:(1) What IS it actually worth?(2) What is the numerical basis of your valuation?(3) Who would be willing to pay that?(4) Why?If you’re speculating with $k’s of your personal wealth that the company is “a takeover target” and is actually worth 2 or 3 or 4x or more, then you must surely have a rational reason other than seeing Phil LeBeau do a report on CNBC. The outlets run stories on flying cars at least once a quarter as well but they have no meaning. What is the analytical reason why you have faith in the exploding value of a company with…-Technology purchased from the same automotive supply base available to every auto maker-No real market penetration, with “potential” business based on (a) a ~30% opportunity for a struggling and yet-funded Federal project and (b) a stack of non-binding LOIs-Massive CapEx and R&D spending ahead should the dog actually catch the car-Consistent 200%+ Costs vs Revenue BEFORE R&D or SG&A-Cash burn of $13M/qtr and $10M remaining cash as of 3/31.-A current value of $127MThis isn’t about who else owns shares, why you hate short-selling and think it should be outlawed, why it’s been worth way more in the past, what news service likes it, etc. The questions are: How much, the basis of how much, who would spend that, and why?"

Obama Worst President in modern times. He makes Jimmy Carter look good
Most of the stuff this company makes is junk food
"I cannot bring myself to purchase products from a company who wants to censor my news. If Kellogg's were a news organization and its political biases were written on their chests, I could excuse their editorial biases, but I would not buy or read their rag. Whoever the imbecile is that made the decision to try to censor the news should step down from this organization and enter politics, or start their own news magazine. They have no business censoring my news, though."

I wonder if they were asleep when the election numbers came in. As a former investor, 19 minutes ago, I've given up. Project K and ZBB might help the margins on an interim basis, but they won't help sales unless the investors never see the savings because they went into advertising to make up for the lost Breibart ads."

With such a high divvy (which I also like), they can't meaningfully pay it down and will be perpetually stuck in a cycle of debt servicing and restricted cash flow.In their defense, their restructuring has cost a fair penny but I need to see better results before feeling comfortable returning to this stock.

Selling off on your own earnings makes sense. Then selling off on competitors earnings 2 days later when you did better than they did. That’s what makes stock trading very frustrating. Imagine 10 similar companies reported on a rolling 10 days and all reported a similar miss. So the first to report down 9x more than the last to report as each miss it gets hit over and over. That’s bonkers.
"Can anyone explain as Stan noted in previous question. How K is moving up with slowing sales y/y, large debt ie. the companies debt to equity ratio is 4.0, one of the most high price to book ratios on the market of 14.5 and a PEG of 10.0, and profit margins of only 4.0%. K is too highly valued for a takeover target, too expensive essentially with too much debt. They would wait for a pullback or correction. K is being pulled up by some kind of irrational K mania, as a value, fair value or growth investor would not buy K at these prices. The vast majority of analysts call the stock a hold. Any input would be welcome."
"120k have signed the Breitbart petition. How much do those people spend $50/yr, $100/yr on Kelloggs products. How much have the dimwitted management cost Kelloggs shareholders?"

"I suppose if we all would just stopped eating we could save the world for future generations.There are 2 ways that greenhouse gas emissions enters our atmosphere. One of them is through human activities. The main human sources of greenhouse gas emissions are: fossil fuel use, deforestation (to raise livestock), intensive livestock farming, use of synthetic fertilizers and industrial processes. The other is through natural processes like animal (livestock) and plant respiration.http://whatsyourimpact.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions"
"K is more than cereal, it is Morning Star, Pringles, Eggo, etc. all solid brands and all that will be seeing an increase in sales due to everyone being stuck without schools and restaurants to eat at."

I believe with a correction this could drop to $48-50 based on low in 2012. Aren't we way overdue for a correction?
In the short-term K does not seem to be like a good trade. if you guys have questions you should ask awe-some*sto-ck*s. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
This stock will reprice higher next week to to the Morningstar (meatless meat) division.

"K, is priced far too high, it provides a stable dividend but w/ growing debt, slowing sales, a brand which needs a refresh to inspire people and more healthy products not ones loaded with processed sugars/corn syrup and white flour... Can anyone give me some feedback as to the psychology behind why some people are willing to pay so much for a company which is very overvalued even if the dividend is reliable but the price of the stock is at a super premium like K's is. I am someone whom only buys good companies with excellent balance sheets with recurring revenue growth at low valuations, I research and wait for the right time. I know everyone has a different investment philosophy but I don't understand paying such high prices for companies. Adobe which has growing revenue, offers an excellent product I like too, will continue to do well I am sure but it is super, very overvalued with a price to book of 9 and price to sales of 11.5, why do people pay so much for these companies? It is like buying a healthy apple or orange for 5 dollars which can be bought for .50 cents else where. All the best to everyone, health is our greatest wealth ultimately. I look forward to some discussions on this topic of buying overvalued companies ie. TSLA is another one."

"And then there's years worth of Project K and no results and now Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB) , results TBD. Just think about implementing ZBB with the same people who sold the spending in the first place. Where exactly is the incentive to now claim your previous spending was unnecessary. They were talking about hundreds of millions which if not hitting the margin line, must be going to the marketing and sales line which seems to be having no impact on the top line.

I am a partner in the ownership of a highly respected Summer Camp for boys that's been in extant for decades. I have secured agreement from my fellow owners that we will not buy any cereal products (like we did in the past)for this upcoming Summer season. We will go with other brands. Needless to say we will not be serving this Company's cereal in our homes and we will be encouraging others to boycott the Company as well.We despise the mindset that operates at K. Breitbart News is far more important to me as a reliable sourceof news than CNN or NBC/ABC/CBS/NPR/PBS. I visit Breitbart sometimes 3 times a day - at home and my office.I cannot believe how out-of-touch the leaders of K actually are! They have no clue what is going on! Amazing.

The workers at Kellogg's must really hate these executives. Not the brightest executives around since they alienated over half of the country.

"Who let all there morons on this board to discuss politics? This is about the Kellogg company. Why don't you nitwits go somewhere else. Oh wait, they didn't want you there either. And before any of you idiots bother to respond, I muted you all so your comments will head down the commode which is exactly where they belong."

"Could be why democrats keep losing elections from coast to coast. Now that Obama only has 13 days leftlets review some of his handiwork the past 8 years and you decide.1. Still 50 million Americans on Obama food stamps.2. Still 13 million on welfare.3. Obamacare total disaster.4. Now 4-wars raging in the Middle East.5. Record national debt under Obama now almost $20 Trillion double what it was when he took office.6. Worst GDP the past 8 years of any president in history. Under 3% all eight years.7. Weakest military under any president since Jimmy Carter.8. Russia , China, Syria all making Obama look weak as a president.9. One scandal after another Ben Ghazi, Solyndra, Hillary's illegal email server to name just a few.10. Obama failing to enforce immigration laws bringing millions of illegals and Middle Eastern refugees into the USA.11. All time low relations with Israel our best friend in the Middle East.12. Now Obama saber rattling with Russia and they have more Nukes now that in the USA.May God help Trump cleanup the mess. "
Remember when spineless Obama said Isis was nothing but a JV team and he had them contained. What a big lie that was. Obama afraid to drop the mother of all bombs. Why? http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/14/politics/paris-terror-attacks-obama-isis-contained/index.html
"I guess this is what makes Chris a MORON....""Chris 3 hours agoCreative Planning manages $24B not $15B. Here is a list of their holdings. https://fintel.io/i/creative-planning If you scroll down about 1/4 of the page you get to $262,000. That mean they have more money in ONP that 3,500 of their 4,800 positions. Also, keep in mind there are 100,000 publicly traded stocks they could buy. That put ONP in the top 1% or 2% of all stock world wide.""https://fintel.io/i/creative-planningChris goes down 1/4 of this page and Chris sees (for example) AAPL (current value) at $338,582 and he thinks that Creative's AAPL position is about the same their ONP position. What Chris doesn't KNOW is that Creative owns 2,356,831 shares of AAPL worth over $338 MILLION. All this blathering IDIOT needs to do is look UP to the TOP of the page (same column) to see CURRENT VALUE ($K) that ($K) means THOUSANDS and $338,582,000 is what their AAPL position is. In order to arrive at something similar to ONP's $260K position one needs to scroll FAAAAAR DOWN the page to where there's a $260 position. Yes Creative certainly has a boat load of miniscule positions but as a PERCENTAGE of Creative's TOTAL portfolio, ONP represents almost exactly 0.001% of their TOTAL portfolio, in anybody's books this ONE THOUSANDTHS of ONE PERCENT represents not even a ROUNDING ERROR. To most SANE PEOPLE, Creative's ONP position is TOTALLY INSIGNIFICANT to a company with $24 billion under management."
I haven't bought their products in years. I discovered their foundation contributes millions to left wing groups wanting to destroy capitalism. The company responds by saying they have no control over foundation decisions.
Is Frosted Flakes so bad now that it's came to this? Why is this junk down so bad?
Junk dividend will be cut.
" President Trump is making liberal heads like fritz explode and they can't stop him. Nothing they sling or say is hurting him. Gorsuch confirmed, a thinker who understands the constitution. The motley crew of liberal judges have made such muddled determinations, they would be better as umps on a baseball team. If we could just get rid of Ginsburg, Sotomeyer and the lesbian Kagan, we would have a SC that adheres to the law and not their personal, leftwing, crack pot views. Let the Repub hope and change begin. Dems will be powerless for a long time. Ain't it great?in"
lol this is my only green
"I sold my call today for a 1 week 33% profit, nice thanks K!"
"Snap, crackle, pop! Kelloggs is heading to 5. Junk food is bombing for Breitbart ban."
I’ll gladly buy at this level and get a nice dividend payout in the process.

How come nobody is here?
The Kellogg Foundation has been reducing its holding in this stock for months and that seems to be keeping somewhat of a lid on the upward price movement.
"You ""people"" are ignorant morons. I retired from Kellogg. It is far from a leftist company. Stop your hate and get a life."

"so what if Trump wanted to use Russian embassy servers for his secret back channel to the Kremlin?Obviously Trump has full trust and faith in the Russian government, has nothing to hide from them , but wantsto hide everything from the USA."

"Democrats are the party of gays, gay marriage, transgender bathrooms and baby killing abortion. Everything Jesus would be against."
"Morningstar. See the MarketWatch article by Brett Arends. How can management not be seriously considering an IPO of Morningstar Farms? Why aren't they being inundated by calls from Goldman and other investment bankers to monetize this asset? Where are the hedgie activists? Plenty of adages for them to ponder: Strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates is lost. C'mon guys, just sell 20% of it and put the bucks in the cash register."
" Hello Kellogg shareholders should President Trump have US Justice Department arrest billionaire convicted felon George Soros for inciting riots and paying for thug who riot in major cities across the US. The paid Soros thugs did $100,000 plus in damages at Berkley College two weeks ago. The lawlessness angry liberals need to stop and stop now. Soon they will get their heads cracked open if they keep it up and start filling up our jails.http://www.independentsentinel.com/soros-behind-56-groups-running-womens-march that left trash everywhere and trashy nasty signs"

"Kellogg EPS misses by $0.02, misses on revenue"
How Obama and democrats ran the country for past 8 years. That is why it is nice to have a successful President fixing the mess they made.
"Forget KO buying Kellogg's now. KO is not going to want Kellogg's reputation for child labor and forced labor overseas or that awful video of Kellogg's employee urinating on production line (Rice Krispie Treats, Rice Krispie Treats Cereal and puffed rice cake products may all be affected--happened in 2014, so check your Best By dates on anything in your kitchen."
"Keebler seemed to be an unadvertised + un-promoted brand.I always plow thru my Tuesday shopping ads and cannot remember seeing Keebler products on sale or even mentioned.K has let this brand falter, in my opinion.Maybe K can buy another brand that sells itself better."

"Mr. Magoo says- Yes indeed a plurality of voters think Barack Obama is the worst president since World War II, a new Yahoo poll says.According to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 33 percent of voters think the current president is the worst since 1945. I agree and Ronald Reagan was rated the best president since World War II."
"Fritz - Hey! Have you seen the New polls on Trumps approval ratings?I guess they're still calling all the people who said Hillary was going to be the next POTUS.....and posting it on the internet for the same morons who were crying on election night to post right here on the WMT message board. You know, the same people who tell you how rich they are but never say what stocks they own or buy. Sounds like you guys huh?"
"The upside potential for K just got a whole lot more interesting. Yo you should really check out Awe.Som.e.Sto-cks., they seem on point with their stocks."
