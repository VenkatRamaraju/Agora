all i know about mr cohen is that he is a brilliant businessman who clearly understands ecommerce and im sure hes well aware of the huge short interest if i were him id go about my publicly stated business plan but have some insider friends of his to set up for a mega short squeeze which cohen is in a prime position to trigger i believe its 100 legal and he can control gamestop while also getting rid of the pesky shorts once and for all i hope he executes such a plan
wow this is tanking fast there are too many sellers right now after hours and not enough buyers i put a sell in for 100 shares after hours  64 and it still hasnt gone through
beware that there are at least 12 million shares available to short that might have an effect on todays trading but the fee for those shares are over 50
all calls are in the money it’s over for the shorts and bears
i guess this may be considered the result of a perfect storm kind of incredible to actually see this one
sorry shorts we are holding our shares as a matter of fact we are buying more at the dips we know your desperate to make peanuts but we are hear for the lobster and steak you might make a couple of pennies but we will make a fortune

ive seen the same shorts on this board for the past week and everything theyve said has been wrong so far they also keep swearing that they arent affected by the stock price but im not so sure about that i wonder whos paying them
shorts tend to come out the woodwork when theyre scared little cockroaches are everywhere
i was going to see if there would be any action on friday then i was told tuesday its tuesday where is my short squeeze
cmg can have 40b market cap i dont see why gme cant have 40b market cap

21m autists vs banks and shorters

buying frenzy is about to begin we all know this stock is going up much much more stay long everyone we got this under control
either hold until you want to sell or sell dont help the shorts by buying their only out is to drive the price up then short and recoup their losses after it comes back to earth  they got greedy here make them pay
guess what not selling
got in at 3955 good idea or not 
bought at 125 waiting for reversal  lol
do not sell and miss that momentum
lol gme shorts trying so hard to shake us on a positive earnings report beats out last year precovid with success in pivoting to online business you arent getting my shares
time to sell bulls reversal is going to happen soon
buy and then
just look at the ps ratio analysts follow after er so prepare for 40
do not sell until 1k bulls yes it is possible do not let the shorts tell you otherwise they are outof the loop
i was slated for buying at around 3 on here glad to see it 10x i’ll sell half then and ride the rest

if you didn’t get a chance to short fubo gme is another sure shot this week trust me
woohoohoogone greengrab your shorts
bought gme last week at 50 this is easier than taking candy from a baby we are going to 1000
breaks 35 youre in trouble
longs this is a war against shortslets destroy them eat their meat drink their blood and take their money for our financial freedom
the world is feasting on those 100 gme shorts nom nom nom
citron just doomed shortsellers lol
enjoyed the ride
think some of these funds need to question who they are hiring if “rabid retail investors” can make them lose 812m just by “reading online” funny how we could see it coming by reading a forum but you “big guys” are blind to it you deserve everything next week brings gme so i’ll say it again retail shorts dont let the institutions pin this on you dont fall for their trapthe price is going way up before anything so be careful
ez money buy puts
the dip is over shorts ran out of ammo for today
short squeezes dont last that long this will come down to reality by monday 330pm
going to the moon
buy amc with 40 short interest and the only covid stock that didnt move up amc  22 close to all time low 
get in now or you will miss the most epic squeeze from the last 12 months
i just read the explanation on why this stock will surge higher simply put there are no shares to buy which will drive the price higher my cousin who works for a mm said they are looking for shares to buy at premium and when they do it will drive the price higher he advised me to buy shares and calls and to stay away from puts he also said this is happening internationally and will become a movie
regardless of your opinion where this stock will be six months out the immediate future is for a massive upside due to an unprecedented short squeeze why would anyone sell at 45 after the price action the last two weeks no other indicator but continued rise in share price for short term even if you believe in blockbuster bankruptcy that is years away good luck to all but buying at 45 means at least a 30 percent upside and maybe a 100 percent upside before shorts are able to cover an one new deal like the microsoft deal that shows cohen’s proof of concept and we could double over night
aloha from hawaiilong and strong  
never underestimate the robinhosers
isn’t that nice
as the worlds gamers migrate to dtc purchases for their hardwaresoftware why is gme relevant
to those saying gamestop will be irrelevant and won’t be able to shift from physical stores to online it doesn’t matter this is a ton of people agreeing to only buy hold and buy more until the shorts are timed out of their puts or forced to cover eventually the music will stop but you don’t want to be the one trying to time it
boomers late to the party trying to figure out what the fuss is all about here
out as 11385thanks
dont listen to the shorts on this board they were never ever even here before they only unloaded on this board because they are losing big and panicking they are nervous and the window is getting smaller as the float gets smaller please cover retail shorts i do not want to see you guys lose money the dominos are in place no one is selling because everyone got the memo that their shares are worth absolute gold in the case of a short squeeze anywhere from 4501000 depending on who you ask no the seasoned gme veterans are not out i bought at 16 im not selling
surprise 13d cohen now at 129
get this over 40before close
oh alright ill buy another 100 shares even though it just fell off the peak
does anyone have any information on those delayed title releases did they finally get released in december
do not sell do not fold the shorts are trying to supress the price
i feel fortunate to be witnessing an epic short squeeze had heard of these before if you own gme put a sell order for 350 your brokerage cannot use it for borrowers
instead of reading this message board while you’re double screening your stock chart take a moment and read this for realhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikitulipmania

this could be at least a 3 days short squeeze
gme is the demise of the retail options trader no idea what they are doing but a conviction that brick  mortar retail is dying 15 years ago were people screaming that brick  mortar is gonna die it’s still there wait when people can move freely again and see what happens at your local mall

i bot long the other day when citron was short  i sold today will give 10 percent to american red cross every body wins
this is soooo exciting
at this point the only thing that’s greedy is trying to flip a hold position into a short position literally just the holders are the ones profiting
hold
an exceptional opportunity to short when this gets to 75 thats when the so much out of the money shorts would be long gone and many longs would have taken their profits if i were short id probably close now and wait for 75
andrew left when he wakes up to another high
i would like to see 50 todayup up up
 where is the dip
we gonna finish at 48 today boys hold strong
hold your shares longs we are in control of this squeeze shorts are trying to make you sell so they can cover their positions shorts are losing a whole bunch of money they will be folding very soon let’s all work together to push the shorts out let’s go longs
going back to 65 easy
people are pushing you to buy more and send it higher so they can sell paper gains only become real gains when you sell fomo is never rewarded
margin calls in roughly 11 minutes dont sell yet
shorts getting emotional and wants gamestop dead lmaobuy sign
normal volume good increase solid management not going down pretty happy with my investment

i dont own this stock but what a way to squeeze the short sellers out a lot of them lost a lot of money and serves them right with rh running up stocks i would suggest shorts stay out or else get burned shorts monopoly has ended stop shorting else get burned like you did today yea i have lost money due to shorts in the past payback
might take my profits quit my job and game all day
well managed to day trade some and offset some of the losses i think this is the short’s last stand

the amount of put options that were bought on friday 
boomers in this comment section still doubting and missing yet another tesla rockethow many times will it take old man
too late to buy in
andrew left
impressive
monday morning gme put holders
i averaged in 4k shares over a year at about 10 basis with some divys before they stopped i sold at 14 late last year after holding on during a dip in the 2s i didnt want to lose money for my wife and newborn daughter my investment thesis was always predicated on a massive short squeeze i will never get out too early on a stock again until the thesis is proved or disproved i will get out of my wife too early to avoid the living hell im going through with a newborn
lol is everyone from here from wallstreet bets volume picks back up around 145230 its lunch time calm down
will it stay above 35 by end of week playing a short option on this one
rad next
shorts arent getting my long shares to cover their losses i want to see more pain
all the shorts begging people to look at other stocks just shows how desperate they are just get out now shorts the big boys wont save you
i see now why some short sellers keep their shorts quiet
the next squeeze is nakd
omg this future bankrupt company hit 20 again today too bad trousers sold at 6 lol i wonder if anyone remembers that i said gme would never ever hit 10 again or that i said that 830 was the price longs wish they sold no matter ill just keep pretending it never happened just like i do when someone brings up my 4 shorts in august after all i know more about retail than burry
another day another billion dollars in losses for the gamestop shorts actually closer to a billion and a half have a relaxing weekend at least you wont lose any more on saturday and sunday but the onslaught will resume on monday morning
shorties telling you to sell smh   brothers
this is starting to get interesting i have been on the wrong side of andrew left from citron this time it feels very good
dont have any holdings here but well done for crushing dirty shorts 
people will always dislike stuff they don’t want to admit this stock went a lot in couple days and it’s healthy if it goes down just don’t cry if it dips a lot
still cant believe citron got hacked
good luck everyone reminds me a lot of chesapeake this past year but could be 100 wrong
this is about sticking it to the man buy
what a beast
hold my warriors 
dont sell hold for 400 
shortsellers fighting like theres no tomorrow
dont worry bulls with 56 days 100  shorts need to cover and we gonna jmo to 100 bucksi guarantee you
hold tight retarts this is only the beginning to our mission to moon
does anyone think that people will take profits and get out or do the buyers believe everyone will stay in forever 
by monday morning all your profits will have evaporated and you will turn into baggies sad
gme holding steady around 1290 and hope it makes move up it deserves to be around 15 on sales turnaround and being profitable in the q4just sayingcohen needs to take over in 2021 and close more losing stores and get to at least 50 online sale
this is the single most ridiculous thing that ive ever seen in my trading experiences
scare tactics in force
bulls to bears
this has just begun i will be adding more monday morning you can be sure of that 
i bought 500 calls and 500 puts lol this is quite hilarious
the next run feels close
looks like another bloodbath for shorts get your popcorn ready ladies and gents
bought 10 more
only going up
gme up 121 at 1393 we may see it at 15 at least by the end of the week good luck all longs just saying
back to 30 bucks it goes
if they announce a huge drop in short interest today this will drop
finally it’s moving north
this is a fast growing share can grow xy percent in just a few days gather up and keep your shares calm that day of earnings will come calm 
citron has no credibility they’ve lost so much money shorting tsla nio etc that citron is left in a coma who in their right mind will ever listen to these fools hold your positions longs we have to work together to destroy these idiots our payoff will come very soon be patient our celebration will be here very soon
when this falls people are going to get hurt bad
thanks andrius an and paul appreciate your input collectively it appears we are on the verge for another higher move lets keep it moving
bulls vs citronhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi1jlkqjrtmabchannelstockmarketswithbruce
everyone loves an afterhours party lol
last chance to buy your discounted tickets to the moon   
losing a lot i set limit sell to 160 someone please fill my order thanks i need my lunch money back
im hoping that cohen buys more shares during the dip and becomes a heavier hitter when it comes to gme and its future prospects if he sells out all his shares this stock is dead
whats going on you may ask oh the sec halted it a third time to let you think over buying more so you either keep going or take it to 0
shorts need to give up already resistance is futile too much buying pressure
dance shorties dance
a new high of day coming boys will close above 44
release the hounds hahaha there is no stopping it
only had 700 in calls between 115 3536 but that’s gonna print like crazy today
i aplogize to the shorties waking up with a sore sticky back side my pull out game is weak
for everyone who panicked just hold the halt shouldn’t scare you
one more catalyst and it’s over
all calls on friday went in the money this is massive short squeeze to cover up
look at nasdaq everything went down
after buying game stop at 42
gamestop in mexico gmemx touched 50 today low volume for sure but still
10101 share sell order at 39 someones attempting to build a wall
hold strong boys we shall become rich but we must act like a roman shield wall to break them shorts and x10 our money d
this is actually holding up pretty well bodes well for longs
aaaaaand its gone
hope everyone bought the dip
dont fall in the trap tomorrow will go down by 2030 tomorrow up again trust me
listen to all the melvin and citron shills try to badmouth this company shorts are over exposed 70m shares short  borrow fees they are stand to lose billions gs is only valued at 3b right now thats peanuts even if the business stays open as a niche market it sill has billions in revenue and online presence is growing strong anyone shorting now will be burned as youre only helping the bigs try to get down to where they can cover going to 169 in 2 weeks ez
when price is gonna be 10000 you are be sad no buy now for 100
30 upside 50 down side risk
there is no dip incoming buy it all and push through nowthose with diamond hands nice
i need a cigarette
cohen is great i’m sure he has a lot of value to add from a distribution footprint standpoint great but you don’t need that if you don’t have demand for your products
all you have to do is holdits like breathingstay with us
i thought the fake news about cathie wood setting a pt was real turns out it is absurdly false she made no such prediction about game stock in fact seeing her picks gamestop is that last thing she will touch 
pretty sure i bought at the highest natural  here
i wish i could invest more but i would have to wait until my next paycheck 
i bet they get a buyout offer at 30 and thats just going to be the start of this rocket to trap shorts
bought a dec 18th 20 call yesterday when the stock was at 1750 will it rebound
come on
citron is just the continuation of the cancel culture it now has infiltrated wall street
why did the stock then fall 375 in the afterhours on friday what does that mean if the short interest is now nowhere near what it was in end of december 31 2020 then what does that mean basically no one know what will happen next week
bought at 130 and now i dont know what to do
poor shorts margin call if you long sell and take profit
at least the shorts were able to enjoy there coffee this morning before their day was ruined
my gme stocks are gold no way i’m selling them this cheap they are at least worth 400 maybe even 1000 at the peak hold your shares longs
beyond delusion
this is the vw dip before the squeeze longs the shorts are digging their own graves hold and do not sell
cohen better do something fast like buy more shares and change the management sp is beginning to go down just saying
we did it gme bulls we held trough the citron short attack
beautiful daily chart completely confirms the squeeze pattern massive volume shorts must scramble to cover and keep up w margin requirements brokers must take delivery and raise borrowing costs longs just add a little more every day this will go on for months the sheer amount of leveraged short money cannot be unwound in short order ha pun intended
400k shares shorted today at least and the price hasnt tanked with this kind of volume they wont be able to keep the price down even if the remaining 900k gets shorted today i bet wed still close 1550
the puts are not dropping commensurately on this stock something is not right they dont let you short and then put dont behave normally dont get me wrong as i own some puts i dont want them to drop theoretically but i do want to buy more at cheaper prices
fyi  there is no limit today it is open end
so much fun thinking about these shorters ivy league dudes losing millions of 
this is awesome the huge drop after hours was all shorts they are down to 1000 shares available to short what a fantastic situation buy the dip and enjoy the sales growth theyve bought shares decreased debt and doubled their cash on hand yes they filed to be able to sell more shares but that doesnt mean they intend to that is simply saying they are bringing a lifeboat to this turnaround in case cash runs out as they are spending to turn the business around i do have faith in new management and their new direction if they need the cash to increase the value of the business then i am happy with some dilution gme gang will win
im not long or short own no options but the move up is predictable but its the move back down thats inevitable money will cash out at some point why dont people start an honest discussion of how the downward cashout trend plays out and how to capitalize on it money is made both on the way up and down
let’s keep our momentum going either buy more shares or hold on to your positions this is no place for weak hands we are in control let’s unite to shoot this stock up
st  shouldve bought one of the many dips earlier today to average down
the short squeeze is happening this will go over 40 with covers then crash when they reopen their short position
diamond hands ftw
what’s a near term price target
reddit folks are asking everyone to buy products at gamestop now omg next quarter earnings will be to the roof
it’s ok  90 pt should be reached before the opening bell
63 closing
charts pointing to 220 on this with no resistance until 190
remember everyone that citron told investors to short gme in september at 6 no credibility here big losses ahead for them they are they to mitigate by have retail shorts take their place don’t fall for it
chart reversal confirmed
just remember mom stocks grow to the moon 20 30 40 50 60 70 its never overvalued see you guys monday at the close we will see
buyyyyy n holddddd
what is a realistic peak for the squeeze
might as well take your money and buy a lottery ticket cauze once this pops its going down hard
gme is such a steal at this price i think ill add more soon
what are mondays expectations
so many impatient people if you arent prepared to hold a stock for years then you shouldnt hold the stock for 10mim
remember dont sell and hold to the mooooon
pump and dump 10000 shares every 30 sec only day traders can without 25000 in your account young traders save your lunch
if you just keep buying and not sell we will only go up
shorts got squeezed last week this will crash soon
warming up to 70 soon
sec manipulation
hold on for just another 3 hours to your stock and the shoes will be  and the kongs can take profit at 60 
wont this get halted today
we should see a new 52 week high today only a matter of time morning or afternoon
i finally gave in and bought high on tuesday and now i am finally in the positivedont let me down im keeping the faith
keep it going please buy buy buy this could double againnever sell
obviously alot of mixed perspectives the only one that makes sense is that cohen is a very smart man and he understands how to turn companies around and take advantage of the investor base as noted before he sold chewy for 3billion it is now worth 18billion he will use that learning experience to ensure he does not leave that much on the table again this is in its infancy and everyone can yap about why or how can this be selling for 39 and change the fact is as someone noted earlier cohen will transform this company to the point where the blockbusterish sequel is not even a question patience for the longs is imperative and for the shorts as you get mad this will continue going up this will have a pattern of taking 2 steps forward 1 step back for the next few weeks that will be healthy for longs to get to 50 by next week if they would announce a 1 time dividend for owners of record now this would explode i hope they do it but probably not smart for the business at this point
short interest report at 6pm tonight
im just gonna look for comments saying that gme reached its peak and dislike them
how come i can’t short the stock
lets go buddy over 19 now 
5500 tomorrow early stimulus don’t miss it
takeoff
people are rushing shopping right now1 list is playstation and xbox console money just keep coming
just hit 100 on my measly few shares 
cohen hostile takeover cmon you can do it
rip shorts
3 digits is on the way guys keep it upppp
i have just checked the slb tools on ibkr and i am laughing at shorties be ready to get burned 
i am happy if shorterspublisherslowlifes such as andrew lefts citron get burned andrew left has harmed many people with his 2cent opinions published by many financial outlets while he shorted the stocks knowing that they would fall after his reports burn leftie burn baby andré left deserves this it is time for a taste of his own medicine there is however no reason why this stock shot up to 76 except for hysteria
httpwwwglobenewswirecomnewsrelease2021011121561680engamestopannouncesadditionalboardrefreshmenttoacceleratetransformationhtml cohen takes a seat on the board
who else thinks a squeeze will happen
gme trading halted
hopefully this doesn’t crash on halts
time to average up
at some point that will be it was that it
its the first time i am not afraid to hold its the first time i am not selling because i am 1000 sure we are passing 100 easily i am not afraid because i have all of you guys on my side
premarket  8090
i will sell my 100 shares at 10000 all longs do the same thing lets squeeze the hell out of those shorts
the board realizes that this squeeze cannot last much longer gme is not growing and that will not change anytime soon their long term debt gets wiped out with a 7 million share offering at 60 its a no brainer and i think it gets done before the earnings release
citron made me even more bullish
i did the math on the squeeze and premarket data looks like 52005400 a share today great day to buy short term options at the open
i am holding
nice run and it is not even at the 1030am power zone gggggoooooooo gme
buying more stocks before the rocket takes off even if it means averaging up abit
target 400 in 2 weeks
who bought at 42lol
listen shorties no matter what you try we will diamond hand if i didn’t sell at 33 drop from 45 why would i sell at 46 this short squeeze will happen so get ready for your margin call
the big shorts doubled down their position and today shows theyll do anything to stop momentum and bring it down hold long and youll be rewarded
captain trousers mike d jedd sold his entire stake for 21000 on sept 2nd had he stayed in those shares would have been 268275 at today’s peak
buy buy buy going to be great
hold it you dont get this chance again target 420

when’s the last time you bought a game at gamestop

stock tip for all the longs  bulls here that support gme but are looking to getting into trading cciv nga qs will make you millions keep the same energy going next week and stand together we can bring this over 100 stand together
so many say this is blockbuster its funny i bet they think it was just netflix that killed blockbuster to it was walmart and all the others that sell dvd for the cost of a rental and netflix having 12 dollars movies and redbox with new releases for a buckall block buster had was rentals and nothing elsegamestop has a model that 70 percent of people prefer and 30 percent dont 30 percent want digital but many of those people just feel like the games take up space and they dont like to show them off or trade them in or resell them even if gamestop died i would still want hard copies of the game for resell however i can sell it to get something back on a game i will never play again so to think that everyone wants digital is moronic for sure if gme can turn to selling and trading games online that would be major make it so you chat online make a deal and trade in the game for credit and then offer it for a hiked price nearly same model but cut out the stores the profits would be major then add in other gaming world items and take it further the real goal should be 100 percent online with 1 store per major area for deployment shorts are to narrow minded and negative think outside the box morons
dam shorts are holding 66 million shares ouch
if you look at the long term chart there are people who have had to hold this for years just to get their money back they have wanted out for a long time and they will sell once that starts to happen there will be a while new batch of bag holders
i still cant believe citron trying to manipulate and shorted how many millions of shares on monday then someone sold short millions today when we hit 44 on monday they traded 20 million shares in 16 minutes who wants to bet about 78 million were short today they tried like hell to bring it down at the 44 mark where they naked shorted probably another 34 million shares i would not be surprised if we are sitting at 8085 million shares short or even higher then andrew left comes out with the 5 reason and they are all horrible these shares short are in so much trouble and so stuck i am not sure what to even say at this point there is shorters in this that are down 500600 and the rates to borrow are sky rocketing so they keep doubling down on stupid 
just bought bb because why not
they dont want it to close green pathetic shorts
hold 60
i bought this at 7 wow
consolidating around 90 you know the drill
take profits and move to gnog
the gaming industry is far surpassing the movie and music industry by revenue this will be the new form of entertainment moving forwardlike microsoft has said gamestops existence is important they are putting there money where there mouth is on themand do u guys know of any other dedicated game storesyup no competition
dont sell and we win diamond hands hold the line 
can somebody please tell me why there is so much hype behind a video game store genuinely curious thanks
i keep seeing 5 days to cover what happens in 5 days thanks for any normal answer
im just gonna tell you this there are 71k options with a strike price of 40 there are roughly the same amount of options on the strike price 40 then there are on all other strike prices if it goes over 40 we could be in for an even bigger day
i don’t think institutions are pulling the rug yet this short squeeze is far from over
wow we can take citron out as well this is a win win situation
theyre trying to fud us dont sell gamers will rise and gme will buy msft
lets compare this place to foot locker its almost have of its market cap gme has almost twice as many stores 5600 vs fl 3300 gross margins are about the same for both on new sales 2529 percent gross sales are probably about the same 6 to 7 billion fl pe 15 eps 3 gme no pe eps is negative of course its shoes and video games same things no yes same things neither fl nor gme make their product they both appeal to walkin and online direct marketing and are in strip malls and indoor large format malls but gme deals in some used goods with higher margins but that model breaks in a shift to online focus the 42 percent margins on used items goes away fl has nearly same business model and they are profitable gme is hundreds of millions short every year where does all that money go
if they have 600m in cash now and with estimated cash flow for fourth quarter wouldn’t they have close to 1 billion in cash at end of fourth quarter wouldn’t that be about 15 per share in cash someone tell me why they are going bankrupt
the latest short interest report from the wsj indicates a slight rise to 6813 million shares as of 121420 that represents 136 of the float interestingly the wsj has reduced the float by the recent cohen purchases based upon the i borrow site it appears that mr cohens shares were made available to short thus i would raise the available float by his holdings still over 100 shortedduring this latest two week period almost 129 million shares changed hands over 100 million have traded since december 14th so some of these shorts may have covered one other item gme has appeared on the threshhold list for the 13th consecutive day good luck
citron making valid points
going up like an orange squeeze the juice
thank the shorts for these highs they are buyers in panic however this will pass and should settle in the low 30s by months end i am now short at 42 and holding for low 30s will reenter long mid 20s protect those profits folks
careful guys play it safe
beautiful my broker halted the trading on gme 
got my popcornin my favorite chairlet the shhhhqquueeeeeeze begin
well done left has had this coming for a long time
today is down boys tomorrow up so sell it
people who make bets that can potentially lose infinite amounts of money want you to believe they are the ones who understand risk vs reward
considering its going to 100 this premarket drop makes the prize even juicer
one more downgrade appears so many times seen this before with other shares straight before opening or after  goes to red institutional owners dont play these games they so long time were down time to take profit then jump in again
buybuybuy 100 an opportunity like this wont happen again
wsb in full controlremain at your seats
y’all are some dim sums if you are buying this right now  great job if you were already in it before today though
volume was good early and dropped off this is why they were able to push the price back down huge swing though
stock was only up at closing due to weekly options expiration
prediction of an early rise to 21 followed by a dip to 19902020 then a close between 2150 and 22
when it dips to 3335 you all know what to do right buy more
this dip is over by noon shorts dont get it just like gme
lovely dip buy 300 shares
hold my hand were heading to the moon
shorts begging to cover
going backup
insitutional bears are getting closer and closer to getting margin called any pr will light off the powderkeg
new paper hands got in just for some momentum new people gonna come in to short it from here as well expect plenty of  around but never forget the si still has not decreased which the whole reason we doubled over the past two sessions
can the bears explain to me again how its gonna be 30 eod
squeezing citron
y’all know this is a zero sum game right real stocks create value pump and dump is just legal theft i’m not shorting this thing yet but bagholders are going to be determined today and this will crash as fast as it went up you guys are just playing right into the hands of the people that want to short this stock
how high can this go
if rc is currently purchasing more shares at the moment we know the floor of this stock is around the 19 mark therefore making the price now a buying opportunity i think the market would react even more positively than his previous acquisition a month ago as it would confirm his intent to turnaround the firm would not be surprised to see this stock hit 30 plus whatever the short squeeze addsnote if a large short squeeze were to happen atm im not fully convinced we could be looking at a 10 gain
bulls scared money don’t make no money all in now we need reinforcements go to payday loans ask your mom i don’t care bring the heat
last warning  this stock can likely open at 50
obviously in order to climb higher to the next level we have to trap the bears on a reload they reloaded today  will get us to 2325 soon then rinse  repeat the same step ladder that tsla went through shorts reloaded at every pullback  lost it all buy the dipsthe squeeze will happen as we climb higher try to buy  hold this one all through 2021if gme is truly benefiting from the gaming pandemic boom  new console cycletriple digits on the way
i shorted 5 shares just for the hell of it bring it on show me what you’ve got crazy bulls lol i will cover if you take it up to 90 a share you can take my money
this is the first short squeeze ive ever watched even better than the first 3 episodes of nurse ratched which were pretty darn good
chewy cofounder cohen takes 13 stake in gamestop
another 1200 at 375 a gift
should have taken profits at 130 now down to 105 lol
can we get rid of the spammers who add nothing to this board
just think about that gme survived the end of a console cycle while a freaking pandemic forced foot traffic to be reduced to almost 0 now the new console cycle has started cohen and his buddies are on the board as well as the regginator gme has already taken first steps towards ecommerce and they will continue to pivot as the time will show dont paper hand this value stock and never ever short if you you are sane
oh but it’s just starting
come on guys  we all keep holding our shares  squeeze them all out the following weeks  let’s make history
urgent request is there any way to get more up to date information on gamestop short interest i wonder if it finally shrank today or did new short sellers actually join the fun thanks in advance for any information regarding this this short squeeze could have a long way to go best wishes to all longs

wow this is probably one of the most active yahoo message boardssince i am long since at 7 and 12 half at reloaded 36i want to express my personal opinion on gmei am sure andrew shorted sq tsla nvda at much lower prices he even went long after he lost the short betany one can pick five reasons to short a stock and five reason to long the same stockis gme over  priced for a destined bankruptcy stock you can say the same for tsla even now or sq or even nvdain the meantime you can say these are trades and these are investmentsis gme over priced no not really what if turn around is a success well it is under value at this price it should be worth 10x of current valuehow funny andrew mentioned that tsla is worth the investment now while he trash talking gmewith that let the battle continueas a side note i sold tsla at 200 before it was split and thought it was inane already i sold sq at 40 i bought nvda at 24 and sold at 280 i bought tsm at 5 and sold at 60 for the record
hold the line bring in reinforcements

epic defense from long n strongthis was citrons last gap bk next for citron
amazing that shorts covering can do this great spot to sell short today or buy back cheaper in a week  your choice
a year ago the shorts might have had a good argument on the future of gamestopbut all the changes the company has made and now mr cohen interest the shorts are in deep dodoare they smart enough to fold or do they think they can pull it outwouldn’t bet against mr cohen
just short this it might take a few days but this has no merit to have 42 billion valuation after this pump  dump stock will fade back below 20 this is how wall street unloads their unwanted shares pump it and dump it
buying more let’s make some boomers homeless
it’s just the beginning
do these shorts ever sleep go take a nap
anyone have a credible free site for daily short selling data most everything is as of month end if not free recco’s for a pay service would be appreciated too

im diamond handing this
message for citron attention mr andrew left so hows that short position going on gamestop oh not so good well we happen to have a little thing called a short squeeze going on over here if you never heard of it i suggest you google it
wow everyone jumping all over citrononly thing to do is wait to see how it plays out unless there are extremely drastic changes which will require a lot of time involved then gme is extremely overvalued and overbought in the short term
they beat earnings buy buy buy
lots of pumpers saying stock x is next however far far too low short interest  not on wsb hit list gamespot has at least 100 of all shares outstanding shorted 
a lot of bots attacking this board now trying to feed the fud hold this monday is going to be amazing there will be so many shorts forced to cover

hey people holding the stock is priced at more money than gme earned in its entire lifetime since the 90s you might want to sell now before you are wiped out for good move on or accept massive losses int he future

gme shares sold short on gme as of dec 15 was 68 million shares the float is currently around 48 million shares with entire outstanding 69 million shares so 142 of the float and 985 of the shares outstandingif this continues to move north of 20 then squeezing out the short traders means they will have to buy the stock back at higher prices which fuels more buying by their fellow short counterparts there is 2x the size of the float waiting on the sidelines to be bought back by these shorts
buy buy going to end 500 soon

the longs will be left holding the bag when all the banks take risk off today ahead of the weekend using short buy backs to sell positions too nearly got squeezed out of my short in after hours yesterday now look at it
every time the shorts make it dip now its bought up by a fresh wave of day traders
yes i added the sold half backfor the rocket fuel
as i said green close ahead

i have never witnessed anything like today monday gonna be real interesting
stop selling
here we go 45 closing
i think the ecommerce unit is worth at least 4b based on unit growth and multiples of other e commerce stocks such as amazon chewy and others
stop selling  youre relieving the shorts and giving them a chance to get out of the squeeze
any minute now  get ready
ok i have weak hands ill take half of it out now bought in at 38 dont see the squeeze going any higher from here and unfortunately thats all this is good luck to the longs
while its halted come to amc
my 10 dollar puts just went from 01 to 53 in about 20 minutes
keep the pressure on till the bell lads
this will only accelerate because shorts want to exit before the weekend
hold and we make history
there are too many people on here looking at gamestop past and not on the future yes preowned market is fading as digital takes over they are closing stores and are transitioning into a digital e commerce front the acquisitions of the past have hurt their business some more than others but some have been fruitful sure you bash the think geek buy out but it still generates revenue key word revenue the future of gme is going to be focused on creating as many streams of income as possible whether through membership programs or strategic profit sharing partnerships i for one am excited to see what cohen intends to do you dont buy out almost a quarter of the company and write demanding letters for nothing
i wont sell any shares until the short squeeze happened
i came to the party too late do you think is it ok to buy 1000 shares on tuesday market open
seems like 100 in the makinglol
gmeupppppp
total  action today
im in at 95 we going higher or lower  
is it gme time boys
looks like the casino is closed may go to 75 bucks by end of day probably 50 by tomorrow
indications price heading to 39 this hour
bull run into earnings  40 well that was a good trick i must tip my hat too they release cohen news at the same time they announce net sales during the nineweek holiday period which ended jan 2 were down 31 yearoveryear now it will run up into earnings and well see if the 31 impact and writeoffs will slow it down or if it hits 50 by year end thankfully i never pay over 1 for puts or calls and not flat out shorting really curious to see what blackrock does next with its holdng
lol yesss hodl guys lets make sihtron bankrupt
if we close above 60  all those 60 puts are going to expire worthless
how much money have the shorts lost due to interest
now thats a very big swing it even got halted lolall the best too you all
this is the best they can do  down 3 dollars shorts in this are going to get rolled just give it time
hold no one on wsb is selling
it seems like the sp has not taken into account the real impact of rc joining the board and cancellation of the icr conference diamond hands
sorry for the drop doods i fomod and bought at the top so naturally it will now tank
buy the dip and hold diamond hands
imagine 25 of a float shorted for shares of a company with “the premier covid treatment” narsoplimab is the drug and the company is omeros omer do your own research from here but you’ll get 35x shares per one gme share at current prices
we good
any shares sold is an opportunity for the shorts to cover and a lost opportunity to make huge profits the ride isnt over longs the people who bought at the top knew it too
no shame in taking profit
just bought 2k shares
dear ryan its time
think well see 159 again im certain
in what time frame will valuation matter
shorts can have my stock when they pry it from my cold dead hands or 100 oer share whichever comes first
i just want all of you longs to know one thing when this thing cools off i’m putting a 4 month short on it because this thing is going down
sp now tanking down over 6 at 1970 glad i have calls but also puts to protect from downside
are shorts trying to defend 22
carefully inspect the charts of gme against bb and pltr the wsb smart money sold at the top around 1250 and moved over to bb and pltr the smart money is gone newbies holding the bag
hold the institutions will do anything they can to get it down before their margin calls  dont panic sell
one bullish tweet over the weekend and it might be up 20 premarket on monday make sure you hold on to your stocks over the weekend
there is likely to be a big spike up in the last 45 minutes from shorts who have to buy to close their short positions
if cohen manages gme right this company is a steal and waaaay undervalued at 38this could be worth 10x100x valuedo your research folks
omfg i have heard a lot about the short squeeze but never witnessed any thing like this sp over 70 nowwwwww
gamestop will go out of business eventually i stand by that but if you sold before close you probably made a mistake imo
guys hold need to close at 4500 for jan 22 option
sell fast or wish you had
no way possible to short more than 100 of stock because those shares have to be borrowed from existing shareholders
loading up
gamestop going up tomorrow to 45 for sure
lets goooooooooooooo
fry andrew left cook him good
if it doesn’t close below 20 at market at close probably will after market
gme on monday be like
hi shorts remember btc is worth nearly a trillion dollars with zero assets and zero revenue fyi gme still needs to go up 300 fold just to catch up to an imaginary asset
these pops are not the squeeze don’t paperhand
me comforting the paperhands all the way up to the 100 club
does anyone else feel like gme sticking to the 40 mark feels similar to a week ago on the 12th where is was range bound at 20 next push higher after all the shorts shill it with citron and then the rest of the week cover for fear of retail just btfd
is that all we get give up
gamestop change name to go gamechanger
ahh how sweet
a new 52 week high after monday news just wait and see it is going to be fun for the longs not so much for the shorts cohen is going to party this weekend waiting for monday or tuesday
buy now share price will close at 140 today buy buy buy short squeeze is coming this week
if you put a lot of money in it and made a lot be smart and sell some for people that bought very high be smart and dont risk everything dont be greedy i have no positions in gme fyi
as far as everyone trying to tell me how risky my investment in gamestop is i disagree ive got an average cost basis of about 10 a share i wont be worried until it falls down to 9 ha ha lol
just think about itmicrosoft spends 75 billion to buy zenimax and then inks a deal with gme would microsoft do this if they thought gme was going away they create a partnership with a struggling retailer so they can have egg on their face a year or 2 years later after a huge high profile acquisitionme thinks noti for one am hopeful that the call after the bell on tuesday will not only give us a peak into how the short term is going with the console introductions but also help to better define the relationship the vision microsoft has for this new partnership surely they would not be doing this if they didnt believe gme could help bring more valueequity to this recent very substantial investment including creating a much more robust digital businessadd to this the involvement of an investor who has already done this once growing market improved financial position and a cheap market cap oh and there is that issue of short interestcant wait
at what point do the bashers not come back 
tendies sir this is a wendy’s
amazing  the best i have ever witnessed and it is so nice to see millions of little guys win
the option spreads seem reasonable lmao buying everything i can november puts 20 strike put them up for sale to me now
allies from the north have arrived to provide reinforcements will buy the dip no need to panic sell we will be victorious 
market cap still only 2billion revenue is 6billion
lol those 42c i have might have some value
i expected much worse than this today tbh let the options flush out and let’s see where we are on tuesday
how can you even short gme
shorts
87 high tomorrow
if you think about it the drop wasn’t that much i’m sure citron was expecting a lot more
blackberry bb is the next one to fly
ya hoo keeps deleting my posts about c intro n
told you fed would be prompted to intervene because of gme the whole economy will collapse
at this point even a few wsb that sold on fri for millions are kicking them selves for not holding
volume has dried up
have 1000 shares to buy at market open tomorrow this will be 100 by end of day
remember when this was 4lol
buy the dip
smh i don’t hold any stock and i know more about the gaming industry than most of the people on this board holding lol i know i could learn useful information from people on here about trading and the market but people keep thinking i’m a short in disguise haha learn the video game industry and you’d at least be able to offer up a legitimate counter argument so far every response has been weak
can wait until tommorow lets do it again guys lets burn all shorts
motley fool needing to publish an article to get this stock down to 16 for the shorts by the end of the year in 3 2 1 
haha shorty
amcx is the next gme
its on babyyy
so citron is the wsb for normies
will the price dip this week under the current pre market price anyone got any predictions
this is yearning for 98 today buy the calls
bought calls at open see you in a year huge upside potential here
if they sold dog food and video games now that would be a store worthy of these multiples or rather infinite multiple they only lost 422  share i see them as a flashing buy at 199 eps when they next announce huge upside
the bears are coming to give us our presents of 100 stock price keep manipulating it wont work
gme at 200will probably prompt the fed to interveneinsofar as the whole market is concernedbuhahahah
do you think that gme would screw over the people that helped propel their stock out of bankruptcyand for anyone thinking that a deal might be made think again why would you take the biggest potential squeeze in history and try to cut it short why not just wait till it is waaaaay too high for shorts to recover without a deal and did tesla decline after a dilution so based on the fact that stocks that are 30 short can sometimes get 10x and the squeeze just began i will be buying over and over
dont sell they will exit at 400
congratulations wsb you broke 100 this is insane tendies
bye bye  and put buyers get wrecked
about 14 million shares after hours high  4747
gme leads the small cap to break out

paper hands selling at 46 many such cases
ryan cohen knows exactly what is going on and he knows how detrimental high short interest is to gamestop he knows that he can make the shorts pay for shares above 400 if this truly squeezes sorry shorts but no bailing out for you
the short squeeze is not over it may happen in days the stock price will explode and you’ll be upset you didn’t hold your positions patience fellow longs
that company is still too cheap gonna be a great rally till 100 billions market cap i wish luck on all bulls we need to sitting tight

oh my godjust found this website to buy gaming stuff online its a company called walmarthttpswwwwalmartcomcpvideogames2636searchredirecttrueredirectquerygamingredirectquerygaming
so just to recap  the shorts are trying to keep the price steady better even to decline  then they profitif the investors get the price to a level where the shorts are margin called they are forced to buy stocks  no matter the priceonce this process has started it cant be stopped if too many people hold that is the short squeeze which seen from the current standpoint is imminent to happen
42069 here we come

holly molly wowshorts will never comeback out of this
shorts what did i tell you 3 hours ago that squeeze was nothing at all were coming back for round 2 tomorrow and we will not be pulling out cover asap or youll spend your entire weekend crying
not sure how meaningful this might be but jim chanos notorious tesla short seller recently said he switched to options instead of shorting i suspect wall street and other big shorts will wisen up also you cant squeeze options so it will be interesting how this might evolve the big dogs arent going to let retailers eat their lunch over and over on these irrational fomo squeezes

shorts always lose its actually comical they never learn
is there a way to check if shorts were covered 
check out the ah volume today only 1 hour into ah and close to a million shares quite a change from the piddly ah volume of the last week profit taking shorts covering another sc 13 filing on the way

477 shares at 3841 thinking of selling half tomorrow to dump into 219 115c but im not sure if ill even get the chance its at 8270 in germany right now lmao
its gonna happen trust me
anything under 40 is a steal
this is too funny 
if a person shorts a stock they should also buy far outofthe money calls to cover which doesnt cost that much otherwise losses are potentially unlimited anybody who got margincalled on this has nobody to blame but themselves unfortunately
can anyone explain to me why this stocks soaring so much i thought gamestop was going extinct
no more bad publishing on gamestop how can shorts stop that from running
to everyone saying cohen and microsoft wasn’t a big deal 
it doesn’t matter how hard you try to keep us below 37 we will pass that level and carry on the short squeeze
22 closing here we go
last time i saw a stock trade flat like this for nearly an entire day it jumped 80 dollars the next day

here we gothere is a bull market somewhere some just want to make freinds i want you to make money
facebook didnt kill snap snap is now 52gme will be 100 faster than you think
easiest money i’ve ever made lol
its all over the news right now i heard  can they make it a chewy several times im wondering if in the am when its not showing 60 green  people will start another buying frenzy also did the shorts all cover 
gme has share reissue authorization already in place major shorts need these shares to be released to help cover if this happens gme will be debt free with significant cash reserves for transformation and potential of reinstatement of dividends remember they bought back 35 of the company for next to nothing the gain on those buy backs incredible the board is turning over to a digital retail genius who openly says gamestop and amazon in his reasons to be involved cohen and the board have so much flexibility thanks to the shorts whatever they want to do they can do bold and underline that whatever put trust in those who have a history of results gme issue in the past was leadership and management those issues are gone no other reason can be reasonably justified to maintain a short position 35 years out the transformation will be complete and this will be a beast on the way to that the shorts will be forced to make the valuation insane as they overcrowded the trade to create the moass anyone holding shares from 312 can sell 25 of the position to help the shorts at 60 hold the rest because 35 years the company will be living out cohens vision
mind you if you think small guys like us are making any kind of impact youre mistakenthis stock has held up for a week straight and big boys want money just as much as we want ittheyre playing the game were just hanging onto thembig boys know if they drag it longer only one side bleeds outdoesnt take a genius to figure this out shortshave fun losing all your money
ignore these paper hands
should i buy now or is it too late
i’m very disappointed with the bulls i’m still waiting for the 50 you have promised me yesterday
in 2017 the company made 350 million in earnings gme was trading around 25 per share that was with less far less short interest and a larger float 2021 has the major potential
if you still want to get in
me every time i see another potential good play patience

my financial advisor told me if i buy more at the open by mid afternoon i will be able to quit my job at wendys
end of day  180200
citrons 5 reasons why gamestop is going down to 20 1 because its just like blockbuster 2 because their sales are shrinking 3 did i mention they are just like blockbuster 4 they are closing stores and 5 i really think they are just like blockbuster ok mr cohen let the short squeeze begin
check out pltr and gme on friday classic capitulation buying parabolic blow offs many stocks are fairly or slightly undervalued people like me not just millenials are also interestsd way more in small caps now or new spacs asthey look undiscovered i get it i do wall st ipos stuff like airbnb in a rigged game but gme and pltr proves the incredible speculation out there is in larger capcompanies let alone big techi also have a list of dozens of companies worthbillions which were penny plays 6 months ago yet have zero sales nndm being poster child
this is not a short squeeze this is a gamma squeeze in other words the covering has not yet begun this would be up a hell of a lot higher if it were a squeeze think hundreds of a percent as opposed to just 41
this is what happens during a short squeeze citron deserves it next stop vff
yesterday it began its run up around 1030 eastern
if anyone who is holding big amounts wants any private dd message me im doing everything i can to coach you all to the 100 club
i dont think gamestop competing with amazon is a pipe dream at all they have a great infrastructure in the video game business if they were to transition to a technology company with a focus in esports or games they could seriously succeed ryan cohen has this vision
it always dips a bit around this time and goes back up after 1115
bye shorts
guys dont sell this is just the beginning trust me
not expecting this to be only a one day event
we are going upppppp boys
i had put a limit of usd 60 for my 1000 shares should i put it at 100 now
mr cohen seems to want gamestop to be a customer friendly ecommerce organization he is smart enough to know he can’t get all the customers because of places like walmart amazon etc but believes that there are enough people in the market who values customer service  a family atmosphere to have a successful company
a peanut hes a clever tweeter
hear from my cousin at goldman that they are shorting 2 million shares in half an hour
guys this was supposed to be the price of gme but then citron with their three day scare tactic shook out weak hands
this reminds me of zillow stock the short squeeze kept bringing the stock price up which brought in more shorts which kept bringing the price upit hit like a 200x multiple before if finally came down to reality good for gamestop longs
again longs are too strong well done guys
diamond hands boys
wait for the ryan cohen tweet and then will fly again 
longs has their day today shorts will have their day soon
guys hear me out our friend tan is an acne ridden virgin spreading propaganda on this page if gme hits 25 tomorrow let’s all use our tendies to pitch him to buy him a girl for the night and a bottle of proactive acne cream whose with me gme to the moon

hey shorts see ya at 100 monday 
30 tomorrow
here comes the pain 55
did this just get halted at 69 gains
buy buy buy thanks
havent been shaking this much ever since i took 5 tabs of lsd
puts that expire today at 40 are selling at 350 goes to show how many people think this will tank today
dont listen to the bots pretending to sell their shares to take profits theyre fake they never bought anything diamond hand longs
next week squeeze will lead to most if not all outstanding shares to be counted for the short float is 260 percent once there is a shortage on available shares expect gme to announce a shelf offering of 100 million dollars of shares at probably 85 to 100 a share its what tesla did gme is following in its footsteps to build insane capital all the while squeezing it higher good luck to all its about to get crazy
clovis oncology running get in back to 100
solid afternoon gentlemen and ladies picked up another 600 shares on the big dip this morning  thanks chitron
after we financially bomb melvin capital
call me crazy but i think our gme management are geniuses and are taking notes from wsb they are now able to sell 200 million shares but they dont have any date to do so i think they want a piece of a short squeeze when the squeeze happens they will sell into it to generate huge amounts of cash and then when the stock drops back down they will continue their buybacks this is genius and a great way to increase investor value especially their own since they dont plan to sell their personal shares in case of a squeeze if this is the case this will be epic
rc gonna drop pr soon
tomorrow mornings pre market will be very interesting there will be alot of drunken sailors by 830am ouch for the shorts yeah they may drive it down to 50 early but they will come to the redemption session by 2pm to close this is an addictive environment so stay awake all night and figure out your strategy go long go strong and screw the shorts is my best opinion
in going to laughs at tan when cohen announcing he bought more shares this week
i bought 4 puts strike price 39 expiring next week i kid you not i may have lost 1000 here oh well bad play
shorts be like lmaooo timberrr
jim cramerjimcramershortages of everythingincluding stocktonight on madmoneyoncnbc
longs this is a good dip for entry i bought another 500 shares before this thing shoots up to 100 shorts are not going away so we have plenty more chances to squeeze them out again the higher the number of shorts the bigger the squeeze basic fact that they will have to buy shares to cover their positions
good afternoon mr shortwe are writing to you in regards to your margin account
people really dont understand what is happening to this stock i wouldnt be surprised to see 45 ah
only 900k shorts are covered from yesterday and they got away easy because of weak hands
will this break 43

ultimate pump to dump coming lol
attal alanjust brought 125000 shares
surely this will go down the tubes at some point the only argument for the longs is that the market can stay irrational longer than shrorts can stay solventtherefore timing is everything in this very case
not in this stock but every investor is watching gme for laughs as the price keeps going up and endless articles are popping up for those who are long great stuff wow for the shorters you guys are dead meat haha
wondering if citron and melvin are just using this a trading vehicle short at 38 buyback at 36 repeat again and again with this volume would be easy to get in and out

cnbc just featured gme for a moment commenting on the short squeeze this exposure will extend this rally further
someone is going to get hurt playing this game another kodak moment
this will be one for the history books
is it halted or the app
clvs  shorted 100 to 3
everyone getting on gamestop train to 100 even 200 clearly this will not happen and each uptick becomes more risky as shorts are closed that’s how it works
dont own any but to those who do hold it gamestops got a few bucks of cash they will survive this and i think their startegy of combining digital with physical space is great especially given this pandemic
i’m not a stock trader but i did stay at holiday inn express last night buy gme to the moon
take gains over to clovis oncology 40 short float
this will go 500 but only if people buy and importantly hold do not sell for less it gives the shorts outs
looks like you guys are still sitting in a circle passing around the crack pipe that stuff kills
citrons attack isnt affecting this
anyone read that cramer article in it which you can find on the yahoo feed second most recent post citron said that there is no business that is more commoditized and competitive than having food delivered from the restaurant to your homedoor dash is up to 200 since he shorted it lol
this is getting funny and they say the stock market is a scam
where is the guy who kept shorting from 4 are you ok

in a prior post it was mentioned that cohen also has a large short position to protect his downside if that is true is there any way to validate if he has to disclose his purchases given the large percentage of the float doesnt he have to disclose large short positions
buy the dip this is nowhere close to where it’s gonna be
whats going on with i borrow
total market manipulation i would not hold this over weekend take your profits and enjoy
just cover amd short it later no chance now i redeemed myself
this also happened in mid thirties going up high falling backsame pattern always comes backanybody idea about  short now  more relevant for me
just watch the price it only ever goes down when some firm posts that they shorting or spews some article about blockbusterotherwise if you leave the stock on its own it just creeps up pretty obvious whats going on here
i guess my 10 put will expire worthless 
50 tomorrow citron you heard me

narrative currently changing to this was a really great idea by the tutes that the redditors latched onto

3 short squeeze you want to be part of gme bb and kodk  youre welcome
dfv you are my idol
do not sell
the s below are based on an estimated weighted average of 813 per share for cohen’s 9001m shares the sp for the 48m transferred to rcv on aug 2th is estimated using the midline of that day’s highlow of 557522 because the sc 13 filed on 083120 doesn’t provide the sp the actual sp for the 48m shares  the weighted average may be different than this estimate the following is pure speculation  conjecture cohen’s last sc 13da was filed on dec 21st on dec 2224  2831 significant movement occurred between the daily highlow sp prices if cohen were to sell a mere 1m shares at the high each day  repurchase at the low he would have reaped an estimated profit of 13m to 15m  retained the same  of shares per the sc filings cohen invested 75m based on the foregoing conjecture in only 7 days of trading he would have recooped 17 to 20 of his original investment with no net reduction to his holdings a few more runs like the foregoing conjecture and cohen could effectively acquire the 9001m shares with the profits from the oldest strategy in the world buy low sell high repeat process more conjecture in the last couple weeks every time the available quantity of shares shrinks it seems as though someone out there is refilling the pot just enough to keep the train from becoming a runaway could someone be giving the shorts enough rope to hang themselves and being paid handsomely for the rope based on the conjectures could we be looking at a few more weeks of this seesaw ride just killing time by playing with the numbers i don’t have answers only questions btw math is not my forte so feel free to run the numbers yourself
after reading all articles on gme most of people sure that it will hit 400 soon little fluctuating may v happen like halting but damm sure 400
i have a feeling that we are going to pop 100 again
buy calls for 45 its going to see 59
i was expected 30 friday you gave me 38
gme just dropped ps5s online i dont know how many but they sold out in less then 5 minutes i tried several times and could not get one
i bet mr cohen is having a good laugh watching the shorts thinking they are winning by pushing down to stock pricewith him knowing that next report he files will show his increase of ownership pushing the stock to past 25
halted again yooooo
we know it dips earlywe know it might drillparty starts after lunch
i wonder how many people are  their pants right now  this thing might turn positive second half of the day 
this won’t ever see the highs of the pre market again gamestop will soon be in the history books

bought the dip
diamond hands
another week another batch of expired puts
see you on the moon my fellow diamond hands 
do not sell until after april
a quick word of thanks for those of you that flagged the short squeeze issue over the last couple of weeks i came super close to selling out as i had reached a target profit point  and was persuaded to wait looks like a good decision
mr cohen if you read this hire me to work full time creating gme memes on reddit and in my down time ill come up with names for dog toys
helloyes this is the margin dept you need to cover your short i cant i have no equity left in my account hahahaha squeeeeeze
longs set your sell order for 200 on a cash account dont let them be lent out to shorts
wonder what cry baby andrew left is doing today 
the only reason for the massive price increase is the short interest but a huge dent is being put in that today
watch this blast back to 150 then back to 80 two more times
i had 5860 shares at 7
i bought gme because andrew left has a pointy head and i dont like that
no one will be selling today knowing the situation with the shorts
gmes shortsqueeze is over volume shifts to amc
cohen literally only has to tweet and emoji right now and we bussin through 55 with ease
the biggest short and tank of all time next week
what happened it didn’t stay upis what trouser d jedds ex wife’s all said on their wedding night lol trousers you sold 3500 at 618 ummm scuze me did you leave something on the table over there bhwahahahahahahaha
shorts haven’t realised it yet but it’s a matter of time before they are in the deep there’s too much attention to this stock now and people keep buying
check cramers tweet about wsb crushing citron at approx 1215
borrowing rates for the shorts are at 54 
buying the dip
dont sell hold the line  shorts gotta cover this will be 100 soon
do not sell no matter what keep buying every dip
the pounding never stops
i dont get it zero fundamentals 
the squeeze that will happen this week will be written in history books
retail and small house shorts get margin call and have to cover first thing next mondaya 1m short account with short price at 40 gets 2m buying power with a very generous 100 margin when gme price rises to 80 this short will be wiped outbut with gmes volatility margin is greatly reduced even at 60 shorts will be margin called
gamers will never surrender
bunch of weak hands they are going after the 1200 stop losses not our day but soon
in the past i poo poo 20000 a share price but i believe this potential short squeeze could do it ifwhen it happensthe major shorts players will be against firms as big or bigger on the other side
keep buying and holding we got this
are you ready guys
manipulating gme like
who has the faster computer bots or greedy people sell button is going to get worn out
even if they do their share offering today thats less than 1m shares added it will get chewed up and we still squeeze baby
buy and hold
35 today
when is the squeeze u guys keep saying tomorrow now u say next week
puts are printing
the recent drop in gme share price should give shorts an ideal opportunity to cover their shorts and minimize their losses but instead short interest keeps on rising no logic whatsoever an epic short squeeze is coming its not a matter of if but when
gme sec just launched investigation on gamestop gme
shorts get out now while you still can you know you already lost this battle not worth losing your head
just sold my whole portfolio and buying this now will retire tomorrow
way over price there closing stores  who shops  the mall plus consoles are short due to autos fighting for chips it was a short squeeze spike thats all folks
how far itll go today
hope yall know about wsb this is going to get pumped 200
lol nobody knows which way it’s going after trading resumes lol it’s exciting
perfect time to buy the dip
shorts just shorted another 75k shares lol this is great keep adding fuel to the fire baby
the funny thing about many of the gamestop bashers is that if all the stores were closed and the ecommerce was growing at 30 a year and losing money they would be telling us how great the business was and a business for the futurewell that is what it will be in the next couple of years with a bunch of profitable storesall they are doing trying to push down the stock price
theyll try everything to try to win its their reputation on the line now think about it with all their data resources and years of experience wsb is putting up the fight of a lifetime this will end badly for the shorts and i will dance on their graves
buy snpw will 1 soon
wow raised the target price to 16 when that’s been recent support bold move
lets show em what were made of
what now
let me guess 50 closing
company make transition full force to online sales and e commerce shorts burnthis is undervalued news everywhere do yoiur ddthis wll be an online shopjump to 75 within a weekbuy buy buy

guys we have to bankrupt melvin capital who has been shorting this heavily they haven’t cover their position yet
we up a little pre market let’s obtain this grain boys buying today if i can get under 18
what worries me in these conversations is the almost identical pump and dump scheme used in the 19992000 bubble where there were entire websites dedicated to doing this sort of thing look the gurus many of you follow buy early know they can influence you and will eventually sell how do you think they make their money be careful use your head the people who are pumping this bought at 20

hi from greece all the globe gamestop i love you all
the institutions are crashing the market to save their gme shorts dont sell
i’m short this stock adding more
its holding pretty strong
44 drop today get out
short  of shares outstanding dec 31 2020 10208a fundamental problem with short selling is the potential for unlimited lossesexample of a short salefor example if an investor thinks that game stop gme stock is overvalued at 5 per share and is going to drop in price the investor may borrow 1000000 shares of gme from their broker who then sells it for the current market price of 5 if the stock goes down to 3 the investor could buy the 1000000 shares back at this price return the shares to their broker and net a profit of 2000000 5000000  3000000 however if the gme price rises to 69 the investor would lose 66000000 690000003000000
stap up boys we’re going to the moon
no panic folks  and dont listen to the shorts this stock was still 45 around august and burry wrote his letter back in sep 2019 rightjust look where weve landed ever since and its still a long runway
cat bounce lol party’s over get out
this is a gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze yet when this thing finally squeezes the price will be in the hundreds hold boys and wait for the tendies
lmao keep going this is going to be epic
100 fall in seconds i cant stop laughing
gme in frankfurt is 1185 up
ive been thinking that the best i could do for you is to short a big stack of shares in thisand why the moment i buy shorts the stock goes through the stratosphere because thats just how lucky i am in life
nothing like squeezing 2 tatas at the same time the first shorts and yesterdays shorts gotta love it
45 closing catch me if you can
in 5 years the ps5 pro will come out and guess what it will be digital only will not be disc by then stadia will be 1 in subscribers there will be unlimited game streaming subscriptions
this is a resilient group of longs it’s almost like you would think gamestop was a profitable company or something
summing up the gme experience enjoyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2kpjtkvkng0
shorts have to buy longs do not have to sell end of discussion
the squeeze hasnt even happened yet there is still 140short intrist
hold it and it will squeeze atleast 500
the short interest is still going to be high with or without additional sharesif company is successful with its transformation shorts are still in trouble
short better prey that they hold the line and short more today all it takes is one big player to capitulate and its going to run heavy i am wondering what some of these big funds are thinking after being down 300400  what the analytics department is showing of the possible outcomes if this takes off again the short interest has been high since marchoctober then it went just crazy levels and at this point it wont take much to really light a fire here i guess we will find out but they are severely handicapped
in at 19 a few weeks ago thanks to wsb going to be a nice weekend
what do you guys think it’ll do over the weekend
obviously manipulation they’re buying up all the paper hands shares
just pdtd my way out of dec18th calls too much gain to let waste away overnight good luck all ill take my 130 and run
shorts watching their money vanish best start covering
im there from 11 usd so i will ride it up to 300
looks like shorts not worried yet i think any real squeeze does not start until the price goes to 20 let’s hope the news they put out in january on holiday sales gets us there panic will begin if this goes past 20 unacceptable losses plus the interest rate plus not enough shares to cover if cohen adds more say to 1520 percent that might propel stock to 20 also because then he may be going for controlling interest
keep pushing dont sell that was artificial resistance
elon musk buys gamestop imagine the short squeeze 
pt over 9000

bulls please put market orders when you run for the door your lunch will be much tastier
people will soon realize they bought the hype because of how big the gaming industry is it’s also an industry that’s never going away gamers will always exist in the world but not gamestop just because an industry is massive doesn’t mean every company in it was meant to survive

this is how you learn not to chase a stocka quick lesson only a few hours and you will remember it for a lifetimeif you have a nice profit on something this rare and unusual bank it and youll look back with a smilelet it ride and you will remember it for the lottery winner you never cashed
now that citron is out of the way we await our lord and saviour ryan cohen to make a statement that will make us rich all hail gamestop 
the beast wont stop
this is circuit breaker this always happens in crashes and extreme runups dont panic and hold trading will resume in a couple of minutes hold and let the squeeze do the rest
they blowing up beat down companygnus april 16 2021 call options are between 05  30same like gamestop they sold those 12 call options for 50 insanegnus bb amc call options volume is in the sky

i think they said who bought at 90 hes in trouble lol 50 up easy keep shorting and covering guys
here we go again  keep buying friends too the ing moon
charts for 220 and no resistance until 190
we often discuss what appears to be an epic upcoming short squeeze fueled by panic buying by shorts margin calls and a shrinking float of available shares what will literally dump fuel on an open fire are the true vultures of wall street  the daytraders when they see their alerts popping up on their screens about a stock thats flying up on huge volume they will pile in they will certainly add a lot of exhuberance to the share price and correspondingly that will add to the demise of the shorts itll be quite the spectacle go plug
i hope you all like juice there will be a lot of squeezing going on
shorts losing their mansions trying to keep us out of teslas we are only building levels of resistance for drops as they spend every dollar they have and continue to liquidate assets to cover their puts
mr cohen and gang lets give f ing citron a very good lesson they manipulate the market they bet agains companies they do it over and over again its time to liquidated citron
do not let the shorts cover do not sell longs
apparently gme is releasing a new game that makes you immune to covid19 and when you buy two you get a free ev filled with cannabis

someone is trashing game stop on tv saying they have no future with streaming games

6 months ago there where rumors of bankruptcy and now this take your gains and run gamestop has been so horribly managed for years no way the company is worth the price now

they halted trading to make a short attack
come to amc boys
citron rn  haahhahahaha
this is why you dont short
next week is our week
i’m just stating that mr cohen is a successful ecommerce businessman who believes that he can again create a successful business in the gaming worldhe invested in gamestop with it billions of dollars in sales and a rapidly growing e commerce businessa bonus in this purchase was having brought an over shorted stockmr cohen will be successful in that business or change to a business that will be successfulthe heavy short position helps protect his investment that is just a bonus
pc building stations will be sweet
how many people have a ps5 lol
i still cant believe how much trouble the shorts are here some of these funds that are short are down 300500 just look at the short interest over the last year i just dont understand why they keep piling on naked shorts and instead should cover if my fund was short 10 million shares and down 400 wouldnt you cover wouldnt there be some analytic team showing you the numbers are just against your position instead look at tuesday where citron announced the short and 20 million shares traded over 16 minutes then today when we dropped from almost 45 to 38 with another 14 million shares i have no doubt in my mind that this has 8085 million shares short i also dont understand the continue pile of shorts even when the thesis of the short is broke ryan cohen just took ownership of 13 followed by 3 boards seats cohen is going to create a incredible platform for gaming followed by selling the under performing brick and mortar then turn some of the bm to a build your own pc this model would be just amazingto top it off you have a ps of 46 where the industry standard in 24 it would need to 5x just to get at a level of price per sales comparable to a sp 500 stock if you look at the all time high of 60 it also had 210 million shares or 3x as many shares as today in order for gme to reach a all time high we will need to be at 180 level next how would a fund even get out of this would they buy 100000 itm and just cover then unwind before expiration  the shorts are in some serious trouble here and might leave some short funds bk
i guess some lawsuits will pop up in next few days
watching this is funny
they are having a ball on wall street bets  sounds like they have their sell orders in at 180  poor andrew
before hours pricing is all over the board guaranteed the shorts are now feeling the pain of no return if we have an up day today just wait for noon time tomorrow merry christmas shorts you will be returning all gifts for cash to pay your margin calls
looks like they will halt trading just before the bell
so who else still has diamond hands here   lets go
i’m not invested but
this is out of control
all as i said i’m not selling single gme share to make other to buy whom i call scary scammers
i love the lovely pain of shorts especially citron
gme this is going to like but with fundamentals 5g and actually pays 5 dividend lol just buy and join our gme brothers
how does me buying it in the eu affect us prices
420 is the last resistance after that it is going to the moon
do people even realize the amount of margin calls are going to go out today on the shorts
41 sliced like butter keep it goin lads 
i am losing confidence how sure are we to keep this over the long weekend
you can almost feel the electricity in the air
finally able to short borrowed 1000 shares at 134
prepare for the painful reversal the stock is a trade not an investment
slow and steady just keep buying
even if the company would go bk a large investor could influence the creditors and court to go along with his plan thus not diluting the shareholders interestthe price might drop in the meantime but with the shorts being 130 all of the outstanding still would not be able to close all their positions thus they are still short squeeze situationi’ve been involved in a company that went bk and came out of it with no loss of shareholder interest so i know it can happen
genuinely confused on how one reddit page can convince 40k in net stock that the price is going to moon gamestop is gamestop a failing retail enterprise that sells primarily physical games that take as much storage as an online download except online downloads can be reinstalled and don’t break and also you don’t have to leave your house please stop wiener jerking this stock and confusing genuine potential investors
do not sell early do not give short sellers tge chance to bail out hold 1k might be possible if we trigger 115 calls
abus 405 and the short squeeze of a lifetime think about a small long position before the parabolic
youve fought well shorts but you cant stop a train without getting hurt
thanks for the dip time to go back up
all hail the marijuana tree
doesnt look good for the bagholders who bought in the 70s
hmm price paid for gme shares two days ago by funds was 1656 according to fintel cohen paid about 840 per share they will take profit after pump stops 80be careful
this is going absolutely crazy moving toward 20 now  hope we dont get disappointed tomorrow i am not sure my 20 calls for 1224 expiration will survivejust saying
ill keep it short this will not be a long term investment anymore ive evaluated the situation and i fully believe a masive squeeze is coming very soon whether you want to believe it or not is on you but i am warning those who short please get out i dont care about melvin but i do care about people with families theres a reason im not shorting this stock or touching options because i do short occasionally please listen to me
alright boys its time were going to the movies amc amc amc
i think80 today is easily possible
shorts just borrowed 750k shares it will drop a bit and then keep climbing
plenty of sellers remain and shorts are holding the stock up i think a good entry would be near 25 after the dust settles i sold my shares today at 3815 with a 50 trailing stop thank goodness as it dumped into 30 in a very speedy fashion do not be so certain there are no sellers remaining it just takes one big holder to unload closing stores assisted the increases in the open stores by reducing the cannibalism of too many stores no news if profits are improving only sony sales and new board members not worthy of such a stock jump nice but really greed has a way to backfire so be careful
they keep adding higher put strikes max now is 150 looking for the 300 put by the end of the day 
just hold the stock and buy on dips its not that hard
iv much too expensive to buy puts or calls to the sidelines
were going to scale 200 today
stay away
hahahha
just bought 400 more shares
take it up
keep shorting i want a squeeze that will take this to 200 my calls are doubling by the minute here
citron and andrew left just lost a ton of money shorting this longs literally killed the shorts lol
shorts are you ready to cover yet lmao its literally free money staring you in the face
all time high for this stock was 6211 back on december 1st 2007 were passing it today folks no upward resistance when you’re making new highs every second 
next week will enter in a new eraa batelfield beetwen ordinary people who lose many time because market manipulation and the manipulaters tones of emotions will be spread arond stay strong 
that’s okay gme you go when you’re ready
volkswagon dipped 30 before it went to 1k
almost 30 million shares traded wow cannot wait to see the open tomorrow hopefully ah shows a 22 print
im going to diamond hand my 20 shares of gme till 1000
do any shorts really think this stock would dip without citrons bullshtcant spend a single day without one hit piece or manipulative tweet trying to bring it down and yet its still risingjust use your brains for 2 sec and youd realize this stock would skyrocket if left on its own
600 bucks from govnt kids say  ma and pa want to go to gamestop shop some games
ya better take profits when it opens
halted because too many shorts tried to cover
down 15 in premarket bag holders at 70 can’t do nothing but watch their earnings dwindle to nothing as it did on friday should’ve sold and not been greedy
its making a run for it
guess what  im not selling
bought at 3750 i’m down 30k fml
im so hard rn
wow citron suppressing the price for three days for their friends
for now the three new board members are additive to the existing 10member board bringing the total size to 13 the new positions are temporary until the annual shareholders meeting in julyi need to confirm date at which time all bod positions are up for vote and the total size of the board will be reduced by four positions to 9 total if it hasnt squeezed by then expect massive share recalls to vote on board seats
it was sure awesome watching all the robintards buy gme while the directors dumped their shares but wait ryan can do magic
andrew left rn
this is comical
buy buy buy we are squeezing citron today baby
please be smart you’re lucky we got 70 this will not go to 100 it’s gamestop wallstreet bets took there profits and going to short squeeze another stock
the real bag holders are the shorts lol make sure you profit now
where is andrew oh he left
i bought one put contract yesterday at close for next fridays 31 strike even though pm is looking good im nervous it wont hold down ill be quickly switching my position to a call at open i cant believe how much upside pressure theres been on gme lately behind 20 points in the 4th quarter with 5 minutes left and they came back to win lol
when everyone is done trading this back and forth amongst themselves there will be profit taking until there are no more profits
i agree that noone long should be panicking yet but the institutional shareholders who are in the majority of ownership will not risk losing on all the profits realized and will begin selling large phases to somewhat hedge the huge bets
this will go above 40 today and the sky is not the limit
new ath today
better cover right now and shorts 50 is breached
teasing 49
if you are a retail short get out before too late hype is too strong and keeps growing im long and its in my interest to say nothing and let you keep shorting cause you just adding fuel to the rocket but i rather take the money from the big guys
i see a lot of posts just saying sell your gonna lose money bagholder etc their only job is to make you sell so the shorts can buy much better to read the posts by thomas markus an and best of all andrea those are i think sincere and give you the right information they are also the top reactions
daily chart is spot on with how this is behaving
congrats all gme holders  as not a holder may i ask you why you bought this stock before this pumped 
you know the short squeeze they kept saying happened already loooooool its just beginning now
this should be going to a 100 now
100 by end of day
whats the lesson here guysgreedthe shorts fell in love with their shorts thats too bad
anyway where were we
buying for the horde
halted
i have to say this is fun my low is 483 go baby go
today i think the shorts realize they dont have enough toilet paper to deal with their diarrhea moment or enough nausea pills ouch so much for them getting their ppp checks from uncle sam lol
pet smart wanted chewywhy answer that question and youll find an answer to the gme puzzlehurry though the answer is near
expect a fall tomorrow game is over
where are the latest short numbers
ryan cohen is a young billionaire investor probably had ideas to compete against gamestop but instead would rather take an established brand and rework it into what he thinks will work and benefit both consumer and shareholder alike he wouldnt own 12 percent of the company so far hold for the next year think what could happen in 3 to 6 months time
if you look at the past 5 days when there have been up days  i see a pattern where it looks like at around 121pm we get a surge any ideas why this is happening
wow im absolutely stunned two days of insane gains any chance this will continue tomorrow i like to get in the action before it does back to normal
i don’t get the anger towards short first off you would not be making this kind of gains without them second from a rational point of view i think long term short is the right play i don’t have any position but if i did trade this i would look at puts if they are not too crazy priced
citron research will hold webcast at 1130 am est today to discuss 10 reasons why gme is going back below 20 very soon

looks like gme will explode out the gate shorts better run going 50
citron needs to announce chapter 13 soon 
recent volume including today already has been massive shorts can not withstand the upward pressure for long trading horizontal is ok for longs but terrible for shorts because of interest they will have to cover
who else took advantage of the dip
its going to soar this week when the boomers dont see 60 green in the morning just an easy 0 they will pile in after jim tells em to tonight the squeeze hasnt even happened
gme gevo bbgonna be a great daymy new trading office will be paid for by 10am
it will be 300 but come in waves
i don’t think we have seen the squeeze yet many shorts with descent margin cushion still have time before they have to cover and others are given a few days by their brokers before they are forced to cover i think this could run big over the next few days

my friday morning buy looking good so far
wouldn’t it be fun if since q3 earnings gme had actually spent the last 100m share buybacks and bought back say 7m shares they would have sufficient cashi also think if they can maintain sales from 2019q4 perhaps with a better gross margin given lower margin console supply issues and bundling and say 100m less sga and interest than 2019 we would be looking at toward 250 eps for q4
im a long but i do find it amusing so many people sayhere we go in x minutes going to the moon or here it comes yet its still 39 lol im not selling but likepremature a bit eh
power hour gonna be lit af
im terribly unsure about this whole shorting situationis there a reasonable expectation that this stock could make 60im not looking for hype or wishful thinking

this is the first day of the short squeeze and really wondering why everyone is getting off this ride the squeeze just started and all the paper hands are going to regret it so much this is going a lot higher and i mean a lot higher so we know at the start of the wee that there were 71 million shares short also they added probably 1215 million short on tuesday with citron and thursday when they brought it bac kkdown from 45 to 38 well today they the big institutional shorts probably covered 2025 million shares but on after the halt retail shorts added big time after 30 min of the halt there was no way to short this at schwab morgan stanley ameritrade or etrade after the halt they added a few million and some were probably institutions thinking the run was over and a lots of retail where you are seeing it on this board this is exactly what happens in short squeezes they pile on then it goes a lot higher and the gains get cut in half its like a coil of a spring and they have loaded this back up to where it is before i wouldnt doubt that the short interest is still around 120 of the float as i type thisjust think for one moment this is the most shorted stock in the history of wall street there is nothing even close so just let that sink in this spring will pop and coil multiple times before its done all the people that are taking gains here will regret it
i cant believe this  this was my first share i ever bought crazy ride
i looked at qs chart and its kinda similar this may level off at 40s again
to all the bulls
buying big on monday

you hear that its the sound of shorts head exploding
mac shorts have learned from gme
ending a day like this green citron ain’t going to do anything tomorrow as any dip we will just buy and diamond hand short squeeze will happen
this is not a short squeeze1  volume is not high enough when you see  40 or 50 million sharesit starts2  price increase is not high enough look for 10 minimum jumps3  understand a squeeze is coming any of the largest holders could restrict their shares from being lent maybe 5 or 10 maybe even 15 million shares would have to be purchased could be a chain reactionwhy hasnt a squeeze started1  big holders a making  holding while they wait say they bought at 5 now at 20  4x their purchase price if they get 10 for lending out shares that is 40 on their invested capital not bad pay to wait2  base price in the low 20s is not nearly high enough cohen is buying millions of shares at about 16 average he is looking at 100 or 200 minimum3  base price will continue up based on store checks i do my ownand what they reveal in early jan is the announced declaration of december sales not common resulting in a big bump then 1st qtr sales show a large profit and continued ecommerce growthat this time i expect the price to be in the range of 50 to 70then the short squeeze is triggered
digital downloads not discs
comical
gamestop shares have exploded this january the price has advanced more than 240 but financial results certainly don’t justify the current share price some analysts say that the price of gamestop shares could advance even more but my opinion is that this company is extremely overvalued if the price falls below the 50 support level it would be a firm “sell” signal and probably a trend reversal sign
shorts will have to cover although i dont believe this company will make it in the next 3 years the shorts borrow rate is too high especially after the 100m stock sale announce
is that the best shorts
about to go sleep i’m waking up with a gut feeling it’s gonna be a negative day with all these negative comments but if it goes up i’ll never listen to anyone on this app ever again
gme will be 200 by end of next week shorts burning we rich baby
tan i hope you closes those puts short like i told u to do
keep on holding until the triple digits the shorts have no other choice but to buy high us shareholders control how high this short squeeze will get up to if you want to make major profits be patient and hold your positions we’ll all be rewarded soon it’s just a matter of time until this squeeze explodes
johnd writes longwinded paragraphs and belittles people on this board while the stock remains in a bullish uptrend 400 off its lows gotta love it
buy the snot out of it
shorts are awfully quiet today they’re scared of impending doom
cohen raised his stake to 129 from 10 in gme last few days volume good bought some few days back at 125 looks interesting 
the shorts are trying to make it look like people are dumping shares aftermarket dont fall for it it has happened before
dont panic sell
another adjustment to the gme chart
bought feb 5th 50 puts this precipitous climb is unsustainable hope to make 15 per share on these contracts before expiration just going to sit back and watch the show now
clear market manipulation citron is in very deep they’re trying to scare as much retail as possible to cover as quick as they can illegal manipulation of course
yah oo is censoring my posts but they are not inappropriate just laughing at a ndrew l eft
gme up another 20  in premkt at 3750 this is moving up too fast hope it doesnt collapsejust saying
this is way over priced it will end up coming back down to a realistic value

haha what a casino this is just a battle between longs and shorts
tsla now gme gamma radiation doesnt even get stopped by the moon so where to then
i think gme under 20 would be a good buy for a shortterm trading i have been doing it a few times a day buying around 198 and selling around 2010 or higher just saying
does squeeze continue thinking about day trading this animal i would never short last weeks covering proved how risky short positions can be glta
wheres ryan
shorts where you at

here we go
pretty citron did a dump just before releasing their vid
some will become millionaires and many others will have destruction and leftover bags be carful jumping head 1st
with all of the shares cohen and hestia own i wonder what price they will want to double their position and take out more shares of the float and really hurt the shorts if it goes to the low 30s he may pull the trigger knowing what he knows about the future
citron this is what happens when you make awful predictions pathetic keep the pressure on shorts
wow quick 4kbought about 345 yesterday sold by 415thank you shorts
this is what happens when you dont have any financial regulation
shorts working there magic but it doesnt matter
comfy cosy
finally macd crossover on daily might stop the bleeding
even gamestop doesn’t even want this short squeezed they’ll do something about it when it goes back up and if not they want the stock to not fear others when they see it go up a lot or down a lot
one thing i will say is that the people who are holding this thing have a lot more fortitude than me i’d be scared to death to have my money tied up in this stock right now
well if you think about it we saw an 18 rise and with 71 million shares reported short and additional on the sho failed to deliver the losses fir shirts arehuge a billion in losses has got to hurt then again many shorted down from 60 plus
hold the line triple digits incoming let’s start a countdown until ryan cohen’s next tweet but just sec gotta change my pants   
lame the double halt spooked all the people who don’t understand what’s happening
selling pressure is building on level 2
bby pops 10
how are my pumpers feeling
not sure why gamestop continues to rally makes no sense i’m going to help myself to some nice jan 29 put options

it this thing was going up today it wouldn’t be slipping in premarket before the real volume
what goes up will come downif you have a good profit take it and run
can someone that thinks that the stock will crash explain to me how it makes sense that the stock will crash while the ps5 is released wich makes for good sales the ceo says it will be a good q4 and that they will make a profit would like a decent explanation why it would still be down end of january thanks and good luck
bears stucked and in sos lol
they now have options contract out to 115 alot of people on redditwsb are saying there going to buy them soon as the market opens this could run past 100 quick soon as the institutions calculate how much the shorts owe them from all the in the money calls that were executed on friday this will cause even more of a shortage in stocks causing this to go higher
don’t sell dips are expected
taking off
next week 100please hold
cohen is a genius and he will turn gme around and make billions i see gme stock 10x in the next 5 years
lol tomorrow  1130 citron will tell you a secretthe day after that cohen will tell you his team now owns 99 of the shares
gme will be back in the 30s this week on the way back to 20 sorry but longs who bought at 74 will learn a hard lesson
the reddit crew have bailed on this and left rookies holding large bags watch it my puts are fat and juicy like your mom boomer
hey reggie if youre so caring about us losing money you can make it up to us if we fail you can reimburse us all from the fund you work for

just got to wait out the shorts they are drowning and well whack a mole them when they come up for air hooooooooooold for the squeeze
only 500 shares in this mess but at 1770 its a whole lot of fun
lots of scared shorts praying tonight
wow who paid 145

everyone say squeeeeeezeeeeee
cheers longsis there any data on current short interest after fridayi searched but came up short
money flowing in again guys
wsb keep squeezing
this thing is going to end badly for a lot of people
when this goes green 
for those of us in canada who may be unaware gamestop is known as eb games here i think were all aware they were pretty successful up until covid and now theyve pivoted towards online sales and pc gaming while riding the wave of the new console generation add to that a historical moment that is just starting to happen and i am happy to keep averaging up to be a part of it my current average is about 42 and ill be buying more monday morning at whatever price it opens at triple digits on the way soon
easy  novice investors lol
all of you overnight millionaires won’t actually be worth that until you sell
wake me up when we hit 100 please
if i were short i would have to evaluate my riskreward ratio at this juncture the chances are of bk have dropped significantly so there is a better than even chance it will see 40 before it could see 0 the chance of 0 is very small since it the large short position will alway provide buyers if it dropsat this point i would be out of this stock due to riskreward ratio
it’s laughable all the people on here saying the stock is being “manipulated” to drop you guys do realize you’ve run a bankrupt company up about 1000 in a matter of days and still have the nerve to talk about something being manipulated gravity isn’t a manipulation it’s real doesn’t discriminate and it hurts
unhealthy moves for gme i been in nio for a while and never liked big move as it will bring day traders and damage the sp in the process healthy moves are smaller with some pullbacks and consolidation

ryan just tweeted
the insiders cant dump shares fast enough lol
this week is gonna be fun whos holding a short position in loss is most probably going to close it before the year end to be able to net this position with other capital gains that for sure they have in their portfolio given the extraordinary year that 2020 has been this has tax benefit so i can see them doing this move now rather than waiting 2021 where anyway only good news are expected for gme hold strong and have fun longs
longs and shorts both got crushed mms made money
dont listen to the bots the fact is that the shorts have not covered positions this was basically the appetizer to the actual squeeze dont sell

shietroncitron always has the most  calls on how a stock will move wise to do the opposite  load up on calls knowing shorts are now an easy squeeze target 
i know i will get 100 of thumbs down this is a forum for longs i get itbut this is going to end even worse for longs than it is for the small shortslongs you buy at 50 and put a stoploss at 45 and think you are protected news for you  your stop will execute at 10 why because stops work as follows as soon as the ask is 45 a market order is entered on your behalf placing this order takes seconds but during this stock crash seconds will probably mean 30 the bid price market still needs to find another sucker to pay 45 and they will find very few just a reminder no free lunch unless youre in the classic wall street mouse trap
citron just lost all credibility
citron delays livestream call on gme until thursday i guess no squeeze tomorrow either

welcome diamond hands who bought the dip at 40 
to those who held the line lets goto those who folded and sold at the bottom good riddance
as i pointed out yesterday gme at 28 billion market cap is overvalued while hrb at 28 billion market cap and is buying back 600 million or 20 of its shares is severely undervalued all i got was thumbs down yesterday your guys were too busy high fiving yourselves for a unrealistic and unsustainable gme market cap to really too at what i was saying today the exact reverse is happening now gme is down 10 while hrb is up 2that is just kinda funny to me
at the low point my shares were down to 1125 i cashed out some at 39 and 70 24kfeeling pretty good about 1 my decision to hold at the low 2 cashing out some early 3 timing the near euphoric squeezethe question becomes  when do i buy back
not sure how many more days of this 50 million volume they can handle its so expensive to bring this down day after day well off to work
nothing is too crazy for gme now if this hits 300 by eow i wouldn’t even be surprised anymore 
come on 4618 almost there 4618
overvalued worth 10
let’s go gme
shorts are shttting themselves about next week lmao
this might be halted at the open

if you think the bod arent aware of the short interest in its stock you are oblivious cohen has iterated this issue to his letter to the board in november he is going to elon musk the shorts and bring the company back like a phoenix good luck to all
take your profits and move it to gnogready for a pop soon
idc if this opens 50 buy as much as you can choke the shorts and make your money even at 50 it is undervalued given the upcoming catalysts over the remainder of the year ill have a buy order in first thing tomorrow if it opens red still buy itd be insiders selling anticipating a drop highly unlikely though also after buying your shares place a sell limit order for a significantly higher price to lock them up good luck everyone
brace yourselves today is going to be bloody but worth it
shuld hv bought in friday 
no one in their right mind would sell now hold guys dont let market makers get your shares this cheap cohen paid more than 16 per share so he thinks its worth much more than that
like i said the 4 days are up and the margin has been squeezed out now on the fifth day the stock is rising again
how do you think it will end today

shorts pretty quite right now
good report great call future looks good
holy cow what a sight and people are still coming out with all the over valued blockbuster  people just dont see the forest through the trees here the deck is fully stacked against the shorts they are in serious trouble stop trying to quantify the price with the value what you are looking at is more shares short than are outstanding here maybe if people could see it like me maybe i can break it downok so you are at a party right with 100s of people having a great time trying to bk this company called gamestop the place is crazy everyone is around dancing and drinking thinking how they are going to make so much money of the corpse then a fire starts so everyone around ignores it and even more people come to join the party because they are just greedy corps robbers then the fire gets out of control spreading to every room well you look over and the only exit is about a foot tall and a foot wide but you realize all of these people couldnt possibly get out of the door at the same time maybe a few will be ok but most likely the rest are totally screwed that is the way i see it these shorts are toast they are already on fire they are just too stupid to understand also shout out to paul c
gaming is the future oh its already here
i have a great idea let’s invest in a retail store that sells video games during covid lockdowns when you can download games for free online we’ll call it blockbuster no gamestop

should i sell i bought 800shares at 606 do i take my money or wait 
short squeeze with skt good earnings coming monday
that was a fun run
pre market means nothing
i think tutes and big money oldschool investors are more akin to the blockbusters and radioshacks than gamestop is unable to adapt to a changing environment where the little guy has some power too been hearing the story for almost a year about how all us retailers are gonna get burned i think most of us are at the point now where we got a little extra to lose for once roll the dice

funny how gme goes crashing back to 16s pulling all wallstreetbet boys who bought 25 calls option expire 1231  panda bear pulling the plug on that robinhood account whew vip your 22 calls clearly will be otm tomorrow but bum striking 16s puts might be a possibility whew  why tim aint shorted at 22 like bum says and haw boy complaining he aint get a good price ta short
i think gme going up too fast wo any official news too much speculation and will not be surprised if it drops under 20 as big boys exit fastjust saying
waking up and checking pre market be like this week is gonna be big for gme

even if citron cancelled or did it knowingly that the inauguration was happening at 1130 it shows what a manipulative company they are that’s if you even want to call them a company down with melvin and his cronies and all the 
robinhooders are crminals
gme to the moon more profitable ideas just like this one herehttpstwittercombullinvestprstatus1348576374198571010

21 million shares sold 21 million bought who and why
easy to manipulate after hours good news about profitability next quarter and beat expectations by 40 and the bashers are out strong tonight if i was short 120 of the float i would hire a bunch of bashers also
i just put in a sell order for 100 a share so that my shares are not available to the shorts unless they pay
the short squeeze is over guys one million shares available to short now you should take your gains and move it to another meme stock like pltr
feel bad for those who bought at 130 already lol

i am so happy i found gme with ryan cohen leading the chargeplease do your research and make some moneyryan cohen is a smart winner to get behind gme new management
as long as mr cohen stays interested the short goose is cooked wonder when they will be smart enough to get out of the hot water as it keeps getting warmer
macys can do this
greed on both sidesfunny to see the shorts get squeezed but all those trying to get on board and ride this momentumbeware dont listen to those who got in early enough for the short squeeze just wanting you to add to their profits and leave you holding the bag after
how many of us live to kill shorts thumbs up if you agree

does anyone understand this i thought brokers can only lend 50 of a particular securitys shares held so how can the short interest be 100 of the float are they lending shares of insiders held at broker accounts really confusing
42069 it is then

im very bullish on gme but if i was convinced that the stock would go down id certainly buy put options instead of selling short your loss would be limited as opposed to a limitless loss when one sells short short sellers arent very bright at all go gme
will this drop in after hours
this will finish at 80 today di not worry bulls we will win big
we still cashing out at 100
do the shorts really expect the new waves of longs to sell anything the whole volume is just shorts buying up more shares i dont even know how they cough up that many shares to short anymore
congratulations if you sold at any price from 25 to 76 because you earned more money on the shares than gme earned in its entire 20 year lifetime congrats move on
wow they really are still begging for you to look at different stocks smh dont let it distract you
clf also has a high short intereststeel prices reaching record highscongrats gmeers

when i was growing up in the 90s it was pretty common for used cd stores to exist they worked exactly like you think you could trade in your old cds for money or store creditit is exactly the same business model employed by gamestop albeit on a much larger scalethe eventuality for used record stores was clear as napster then itunes then spotify and others fundamentally altered the way most people interact with music why buy a record when you can access a service with every record why buy a physical disc when you can buy it digitallythis the same transformation currently happening to the video game industry and its this reality that gamestop is facing downbuy puts for easy money thank me next christmas
jesus this follows technicals to the t bearish macd crossover and expected drop

an  wades you assume every purchaser of a digital system will follow through with a subscription to microsoft where gamestop will get a portion of future revenue of digital downloads that is not the case many xbox owners already have a goldultimate msft subscription and would have no need to purchase an identical option those customers are likely to require only a raw system and as such may even go to a completely different retailer to buy their xbox digital system secondly the revenue share is not for the lifetime of the console cycle its not tagged to the console its the subscription the subscription is 24 months which happens to be the duration of the monthly payment plan to purchase the console with access after that 24 months expires the customer will need to renew the subscription if the customer chooses to renew their subscription directly through msft that means gamestop will not gain any further revenue now here is why the value of the revenue share is overhyped especially by those who dont appreciate its scale or detrimental effect on games most profitable business segmentone year ago i predicted the portion of digital only consoles would be 25 of total console sales currently that appears to be an accurate figure 1 gamestop is not the only retailer of digital systems there are many others wmt  tgt  amzn  msft  newegg  bby etc etc that means gamestop is likely to sell significantly less than half of all the digital consoles in the market 2 everyone overhypes the percentage of revenue share at 10 nowhere has it been confirmed at 10 the margin they will make on a subscription is likely to be less than 10 of each game msft has no need to offer a generous margin msft sales of digital only consoles at other retailers has been just as boyant without any form of bundled subscription ie all the other retailers have also sold out 3 you can take an estimate of the overall significance 25 of total console sales are digital x less than half of digital consoles sold by gme as other companies sell consoles x  not every customer needs a msft subscription x less than 10 revenue and for only two years the deal suddenly becomes less massive than people think additionally the digital console sales eventually destroy gamestops largest profit segment that is 2ndhand games as digital consoles gain more traction that demise will accelerate you think this revenue share at less than 10 is great but what is the adverse impact of a console that gme will never sell a second hand disc gme buys a tradein disc at 10 then resells this tradein at 30 or 40 how does the loss of that 2030 margin compare with something less than 10 ie less than 7 from each new 70 digital download vs 2030 for each 2ndhand it is bad however given that digital only consoles would sell at any other retailers with or without gamestops participation it was probably the bestonly deal they could go for gamestop is cannabalising its single most profitable segment for not much overall gain this is a great deal for msft as they eventually push gme out of the secondhand business which has irked them for years it is not such a good deal for gme
buy  hold we have the short  on our side to squeeeeeze itthis is a sale buy and hold for the spring into 1000
squeeze of a lifetime love it
i love this stock
gme 5 gme 6so for people who bought in the100 range and people buying now good luck
simple reason why shorts were wrong the entire short premise was gme going bankruptperiod with cash on hand and announced guidance of profits for the quarter it would take many years if all their efforts were wrong so even if shorts were right gme is years away i get almost 10 for lending my shares 40 on my purchase price of about 5 i can be patient can shorts be patient for years paying that interest no yes a lot of brick  mortar have failedbut many are doing well gme is growing ecommerce at a very high ratethe shorts know this
short  of float dec 31 2020 26091omfg
just the first little dip on the way to the moon love the scared shorters on here squeeze has not even begun yet 
let’s hold this time
hold your shares this is just the beginning
we should be trading at a new52 week high at this point
all the insiders are selling after the best stock price in historyvery weark price action
if we get some positive movement in here and it goes up big massive short interest
just one number out of the youtube video shared by dan earlier httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdx6xbdcducg  gme does a billion in sales with collectibles alone with this and ecommerce sales year to date reaching over 135 billion how is a 45b mkt cap so irrational  its a company with almost no debt and backed by successful billionaires that can easily go back to its pre 2018 eps levels20181031 47820180731 02420180430 02820180131 10520171031 05920170731 02220170430 05820170131 20120161031 04920160731 02720160430 06320160131 23320151031 05320150731 02420150430 06820150131 21620141031 05020140731 02220140430 05920140131 186even at 60 a share we would be loooking at a per of 15 which is in line with the market and the competitionand theres the short squeeze that hasnt even begun yet
retail shorts be like i didnt think i would be holding them this long melvin
doesnt look like a squeeze to me
im part of history
1000 wv squeeze
gme stores are having a 50 percent clearance sale today i guess that explains todays increase in market cap of 600 mln
a little down in frankfurt hope it will change by 7 am
wall street doesn’t lose period get out while you can
gamestop corporation director just declared owning 125000 shares of gamestpp
200 coming
every day i buy 25 more shares
only way rc can save gme is if he takes control of the company and throws out sherman and other incompetent executives and cut cost drastically close more losing stores and go more and more online and generate profit qtr after qtr
i just bought a few more shares
god i love hearing about shorts getting burned
only the beginning
no one really answered my question about the puts that are out to march do the buyers of this stock think they will keep this game going for two more months 
the only thing that will save the shorts is some kind of gov intervention dont see any other way out
diamond hands dont lose you will be rewarded for your patience longs
neutron bomb going off holymoly
strap in
as soon as citrons first announcement come out i wished i was a hacker to hack there sight and tweeter and i posted it yesterday there is a god mr theft and not left
another run
i have 500k free i can use to buy gme stock and sell covered calls deep in the money  even if i make very little profit it will stick it to the shorts big time
so if gme activist shareholder ryan cohen can start a pet supply company from scratch in 2011 thats grown to a market cap of 30 billion in the ten years since what might he have in mind for gme to grow its market cap from the current one billion i know hes pushing digital gaming platform but didnt i read somewhere that he sees the potential for gme to diversify its products in order to someday compete with amzn
they auto sold my shares and i cannot buy again
the dip just now was the last one for the day
wsb  1 citron  0
42 closing
this is the first time i see a short squeeze this big in my life congrats for those who’s already in
and they thought they had the market under control its ours now
just bought 1000 stocks potential here is real go long
investing is long term shorting is gambling shorts can buy my shares when they pry them from my cold dead hands and that wont be any time soon
it’s funny how everything thinks the “news” of gamestop going mainstream is somehow good for longs nope you’ve just thrown a bunch of chum in the water sharks on the way and they had all weekend to gather
is this short squeeze already or that’s yet to happen
it isn’t clear to me how this will work out there are not enough shares to clear the short positions institutions own more than exist and add to that the insiders at over 25 how do the shirts ever cover
tan i dont have anything else to say
this share is going to the moon bears just want to make their money back so they will continue to cast doubt on gme
ryan cohen knows and is withdrawing an offering just to kill shorts
bag holders at 40 avg be like “just buy the dip”
lol when a dip happens we buy
ryan cohen looking at the number of shorted shares
all management needs to say at earnings going forward they are closing some stores and are going to focus on online service with guidance assistance from chewy founder hopefully that will be seen as a positive sign
check out wallstreetbets on reddit youll see tons of people posting screenshots of 1000 gains and continuing to hold this is the basis of this movement along with shorts being up  creek ive never seen such a concerted effort by the people but its happening and continuing to happen crazy shorters have lost control of the situation do not sell i literally just sold more stocks to average up lets gooooo
lets go 200
ouch i would hate to be short
 keep shorting 
shorts cant have my shares so what are you going to do now you gambled and got slaughtered
lmfao they shorted again wow dude some people are legit tarded
citron lost all credibility today failed miserably in an embarrassing way

i dont even have a position here but it just feels good to see some shorts being squeezed like thatrip
its ok shorts just relax top coming for you 42069
gme books a net profit of 50 for every 45 game sold even apple cant touch those margins
this stock is a professional day traders dreamlots of amateur investorstraders holding and thinking this stock is worth more than 20trade this stock do not invest above 20
let’s get a quick reversal on the macd daily chart  hopefully this momentum maintains
how can this company go from 200 million to 11 billion to 7 billion to 8 billion in such a short time mania
when does gme run out of shares to short  does that make sense when can they not short more shares in an effort to keep the price down
gme up 4 in early going at 1644q4 earnings est are 180200 but expect a loss for q3 the estimate for q3 is minus 021 if they do better than the estimate  this stock can fly to 20 as simple as that cohen will try his best that mngt minimize q3 loss as much as possible we will know next tuesday ah just saying
i want 60 and you almost gave me 80lmao
im here to stick it to the man i dont care if it takes a dump but i dont think it will that is what gme represents i will be buying every dip today to the moon itches disclosure i do not own gme but i will today i am also not a financial advisor
lmao citron are  now lets get this upward to send those guys a message
citron is a criminal org
you know its a solid investment if the stock stays green after a selloff 40 eoy
buy buy buy before goes to the moon again
diamond hands my fellow gme gang
andrew left citron report who put a ice water over pltr a month ago is bankruptedgme lmnd tsla
gnw is the next gme book value is 30 trading at 3
hahahaha i knew it not even in gme but glad to see this
if you know technical chart the stock is very bearish now might go to red after all the stop loss trigger look it up at the l2
dam added 3 tightened the noise on shorts
shorts just hit with another 15k shares short the bllz on these guys must be massive
wheres that mark guy from late last weekyou ready for what i promised you
good time for a mixed shelf offering 10 million shares to bolster cash reserves
can any of you gamer heads articulate a financial analysis that makes this money losing company worth more than 20
will we see 30 today i certainly hope so
bullish analysts are saying 16 price target i am tired of reading so much nonsense to encourage innocent investors to buy a 10 stock for 60 this squeeze was real and pushed this stock to historic levels in a short time but as the music stops playing this week this will be back under 30 and maybe even under 15 if you do not currently own this stock please just watch and do not be the bag holder there was forced buying into the close that drove the stock up 8 in last few minutes on friday this will get hammered down on monday if a new short squeeze wants to start under 20 that is fine but at this level no reason to buy 1 single share be careful as still so much pumping for the dumping going on this conversation page
average gme volume in frankfurt is 1800 shares a day today’s volume is already close to 9000 shares that would be like us trading 240 million shares tomorrow shorty you better call someone in germany and beg them to buy some shares for you because tomorrow you clock will be cleaned
500 soon
93  somebody loosing biiiiiiiiig 
one thing for sure is that gme have enough cash to transfer itself half stores and half ecommerce
tendiesssssssss lets gooooooo
gamestop reached a 52 week high at 4350
skt is next 50 short just reinstated a 5 dividend profitable reit
this is insane sp above 33 now it may drop to under 30 by the end of the day after shorts are done
clearly an institution is unwinding their position putting the brakes on the squeeze people want nothing you can do about that take your profits and move on or long haul it if you have the conviction
ibkr and schwab raising requirements or completely eliminating margin on gme
going will beyond 100 strap in
buy your puts nowww
guys guys its ok they are just putting halt to make some callsmargin calls
got to buy puts here people market is rigged for this to go down now
dont make the mistake of thinking this is donetheres way more to go
missing the train is 1000 times better than losing your money no money you’re out there are many opportunities to make smaller but less risky gains
just hold and keep adding more it was expected that the shorts would try to bring the price down just dont let them win
where did all the shorts from yesterday go  hot girl james jim and 10 others every night when this goes up there is a new set and they all post pictures of blockbuster some of those messages resonated with me so i ordered a coffee mug of blockbuster and i am going to drink out of it when the inevitable squeeze happenswell have to go to work as i know some of these short posters will be on ot all day i guess we all have to make money somehow
people need to look past all the valuation models and even the short  which is insane and highest everstop and look at the call options there is 15 million calls sold that are in the money this represents 150 million shares and the total shares outstanding is 69 million the call sellers are net 81 million shares short they need to buy another 81 million shares just to have enough for their call options combine this with the float of 46 million shares with 71 million shares short along with 81 million net short from call sellers this company could literally sell you dirt and it will go up on monday the squeeze is going to be so big that it will rewrite the history books of wall street

i’ll be honest i don’t have any “skin” in this gameno pun intended but i am happy to be a spectator because whatever happens monday the result will likely be included as a casestudy in many university business coursesthe tension is nearly palpable you could almost arrange for someone to “call” the action like a sporting event as it unfolds who’s going to take ultimate control over the game traders or shorts will the mm’s cause a simultaneous gamma and short squeeze as the week progresses or will shorts succeed in driving shdownstay tunedcheers

day two of the mother of allshort squeezes
gamestop price was down in afterhours because they started printing selling shares of the company in order to raise capital this dilutes and lowers the stock price automatically

hi guys anybody an idea how many shorts are still in   i cant find actual data about it i am in on different price levels 4 9 and 21 already took some back at 40   and really would like to buy in again only for helping the squeeze started  and as they say  no balls no gloryif we all would do that  we get them squeezed this can be one of the best squeezes ever  we can realise it  but ok  level of shorters is for me crucial data
break 40
burn shorty burn
you bulls are not very convincing lol no one have a single clue why this stock would almost double by next week
watching left crp himself on twitter is indisputably the funniest thing i have ever seen nobody has ever deserved it more
this is just the no ball s dump  hang on
buy now going to 200 small market cap lots of running room
smart thing for the company to do here is a secondery offering sell 20 million shares and keep the company alive for 2 more years
it was gamma squeeze last friday which caused by optiontoday is the real short squeeze 40 shorts get margin call at 60 60 shorts get margin call at 90 if we assume a generous 50 marginbased on gmes volatility margin will be reduced to 10 or 0 so every shorts under 100 will be margin called if gme trades above 110dont forget option market is not open yet gamma squeeze may happen again once option starts trading
bunch of idiots tried to short this again after it went up on a squeeze yesterday not realizing that they just increased the short interest even more which means its going to squeeze again today this same thing happened with blnk people kept trying to short it thinking it was peaked and instead it kept going went from 9 to 5000 before these short morons figured out they were beat
cohen is not short his own stock that is a ridiculous statement it would be a zero sum game and it may even cost him all cohen is doing now is buying shares along with insiders cohen just increased his  of shares from 9 to 13 beware there are a handful of names that are posting fud every day multiple times a day be sure that the 36 million shares short with 136 of the float shorted the shorts are trapped and are desperate so they hire people to spread fud and pay them per post their entire purpose is to get the suckers to sell or at least keep them from buying more when you have a billion to lose hiring a few  to post for a dollar each is not a problem
wow this is going to be fun to watch no skin in the game but the free entertainment of watching a group get decimated is fantastic
only short can buy at this price

its hard to do technical analysis on a stock thats so heavily manipulated seems like a powder keg that could explode but if it doesnt i guess it could bleed down from manipulation again

shorts has been destroyed this is just the beginning alfa chudssssss
why so many halts today too many inbalances of longs shorts options etc
gevo  hod almost hoy

i just bought more at 29 lets squeeeeeeeeeeeezeeeee
i believe citron believes that if they play the god bless america card that all the boomers will do what they say lolol millennials run the world let’s go old heads rest in peace
it pulled back after its previous runups too more shorting isnt going to solve the shorts problem
heads are gonna roll for being on the wrong side of this move lets break some firms
dont be afraid of the dip you will regret it big time
good god this stock is on roids lol
naked shorts

rofl citron is crying to the sec now maybe the sec can explain how is it even possible 130 of the float is shorted how can they short more shares than available to trade they are creating shares put of thin air on the sell side
don’t recall getting an answerwhat happens to the buyer of a naked short sale if shares aren’t delivered
gains at amc
huge volume but no shares available for the shorts to have covered
the next short squeeze target seems to be skt the shorties will not have shares to cover as gme and skt were both shorted stock
mommy im scared
extreme volatility always precedes a major market crash
when this thing crashes it will crash hard just think about their business model there is none another jcp radio shack toysrus
no smart investor ever became wealthy from shorting all these infamous short sellers make it good once but loses 10 more times real investors get wealthy from being long speculators make peanuts from shorting cohen is heavily invested in gme to make billions do you really think he wants to lose millions and waste his time think about it why would cohen be so heavily invested why would he bring in his own people this is largest turnaround ever one big announcement from cohen and these shorts will be slaughtered
the tesla of game stores right lol
traders pulling out now for the next short squeeze  amc
one day youre on top of the world shorting gme the next youre dropping hummers in the alley for gas and smokes
hour ago i posted there go 40 now see ya 39 my puts have almost doubled bagholders
im trying to understand what is massively undervalued the game card dispensary or the used equipment that they sell even guitar center went bk selling used equipmentjust sayin
shorts desperate to keep this under 60 one more breakout above could send this back to 75 quickly why would shorts hold through weekend could gap up to 75 on open monday
repeating a past post that one minute the stock is extended ahead of itself etc even before the most recent deal announcement what do you think young people are doing at home during a pandemic yes among other things they are playing more video games of course it is smart to trim positions that have gone up substantially but you really have to question the agenda behind articles that scare you out of winning positions how many warnings were there about tesla or back when amazon never made a profit were the warnings motivated by shorts or simply the plethora of socalled experts and analysts who have opinions for which they seldom are held accountable
this stock is going down the drain
i have never made more money so quickly in my entire life as i did when i bought puts at 141 and sold at 90 
if it closes above 3950 we are going back to mid 40s tomorrow
do i hear 40 sooner than you think

lmao love to see people think this is going to 200 or 120 you’re lucky it got this high i don’t even think gamestop wants this because it’s going to be hard for them to run a business like this
this is insane lol
havent ate smoked a pack of cigs even if i lose all my money i feel like its about the equivalent to how much gme cocaine i did today
hahahahaha citron doesn’t know that event like inauguration happens the same date always  pure market manipulation to slow down the squeeze but we will diamond hand this
they are trying to cause artificial sell offs and doubt
nothing provides a warm fuzzy feeling like watching a bunch of short boutiques going bk
if missed the ride up on gme to be a millionaire by buying calls then dont fear you can ride the price down
welcome to the era of fed intervention gme proves the fed has achieved “smooth market functioning” lol

i remember what a nightmare it was to hold gmegood to see shorts finally bleed
cohens tweet is literally warning you
the crash has begun its bailout time
shorts are paying 45 interest to borrow and there is still a massive short interest that cant get out this squeeze is going to be epic and shorts are going to get destroyed

is it too late to buy
the hole market is down but sigl is up today igen gme is a no brainer
citron research is one of the bigges scams going how are they still around they lie cheat and steal its illegal what they do
i don’t think people understand how much higher this will go this is unprecedented and it’s backed by internet lunatics who won’t sell until they see 100 they are literally willing to lose it all for the sake of destroying the shorts you simply can’t beat them and when you can’t beat em join em
a lot of people here have fundamental value and some extreme technical situation horribly confused
up
going up retail shorts covering shorting covering trending trader feeding frenzy the crash will be as epic as the rise
the real buying begins now
power of the people
wow have never seen this kind jump on nothing
im new to gme ive been monitoring it for like a week and im astonished in its surge currently im holding in aston martin and rolls royce and i for one didnt know how much gme will rocket what are your thoughts for next week will it continue to rise or will it drop drastically back to the 3540 mark
what’s with the huge drop
haha the market hates shorts
be honest who bought at 76
question many people say they have a hard time even finding shares to borrow for shorting do how did citron manage to sell short 2000000 shares must be something shady anyway all longs should load up on shares and drive this charlatan into the poor house
why its possible to halt this is cheap trick of shorties why is that allowed
bears thinking they are in control
dont sell in 420 hold for 10000
holy  what happened here totally missed the news on this one
you can see the desperation of others trying to stop you from making money  dont listen hold your ground
110 calls are available expect gamma squeeze again 
250 this week
well we officially are in fomo mode now
retail ongs still getting sucked in above 35 they will add on the way down then add some more then panic sell under 30 low 20s will be a cake walk 18 is where this ends when the hype is completely gone
why would anyone pay for a gme membership when it’s not required to to play online like xbox live or a psn membership is psn gives you discounts and free games so why pay for two memberships when you can just get everything from psn or xbox live makes no sense that anyone would pay extra for a gme membership or even buy a hard copy of the game that takes up space you might lose it and the disc might get scratched up having everything on your cloud library on psn is so much better hard drives are only getting bigger and faster each year gme is toast
looks like some are leaving yall and jumping into amc and bbby
zacks equity researchtue january 5 2021 854 am est·2 min readinvestors in gamestop corp gme need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately that is because the feb 19 2021 3000 call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options todaywhat is implied volatility a win for gme
sell shorts before the spanking of a lifetime on tuesday
gme is going bankrupt and nothing will change that this is kodk all over again
this is wild
this stock has more than 99 of shorts to be squeezed it will not stop squeezing before all shorts have covered this will go forever like 23 years till we are reaching 8000share
shorts have two options either cut your losses and cover asap or slowly bleed out from the 30 borrowing fees and delay your fate its not a matter of if you get margin called but a matter of when
wooow i told you dont sel friday
do not put a low sell limit we going higher way higher this is a short squeeze
my logic to take profits and run i have been where stocks like this can go down 10 20 30 and i will be kicking myself for not taking a profit in since 16 out at 65 plus is good enough what was i thinking friday saw that 77 and got greedy not anymore
just look at the leverage in the short term significant cash flow this quarter profitability reduced debt the negative they have not specified their long term plan maybe intentional cohen lurking in the wind with recent highs of 19 sooner or later shorts will recognize this is one they should move off of cohen is devising his take out strategy goooooo longs
if any good news drops shorts are toast
it funny that gme has 5b  revenue and still manage to lose  270m  in net income there is not much cash left bankrupt soon but epic short squeezelol
gme is hot and investors want it  james cramer
hold hold this just the begining to the moon
just added during the tip
httpsredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsl3fye9howfridaysgmegammasqueezemaytriggerashort
it’s all the fault of gme
dow is tanking down over 200 points and taking gme with it just saying
this guy called it at jan 10th we cant loosehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjlwxg5h7cg
citron live tomorrow as to why this stock is going back down to 20 we are the captain now
this reminds me of early nflx days after it gradually transformed from mailing dvd to online video streaming it pops 100 every a few days
bye back to 40
move to clovis oncology clvs people are about to bag hold here hard
watching next citrons move yolo
the thing to really remember if youre worried about this losing steam a ton of more shorts came into the game today fresh lemons for everyone
short interest is still above 100 the price spike was retail buying not a short squeeze if you believe in ryan cohen this is a dip you will want to buy
placed my short position thankyou
this story is starting to trend so it’s about to become a mainstream investment be thankful we are here now
we squeezed like 1 shorts and new shorts jumped up to bring it down nothing changed still the potential skyrocket
cover your short position while you can were ending green and will be up 12 or more by end of week your decision today will determine your financial future you can ride with the wave or try and swim against it dont drown trying hop on board and sail with us 
377 next target
pt on a squeeze is 1000 considering the vw squeeze was a 5x bagger and on 32 short interest gme has 100140 of the float short so its 10x easy from 100 hold and do not sell longs
11m closing for me still holding
hold so they cant short
up trend has not changed momo stock always run this way
uhmmm andrew left got what he deserved for all the things he did to other corporations for his own profit
after melvin and citron go bankrupt
gme can really transform now that its taking the online route seriously if something as  as roma did it then there is every chance its should become the game changer and official streaming platform for games online
congratulations everyone glta
brain smooth jackedmargin calledgamestop cantstop
the 3 trading halts scared a lot of traders the stock price would have hit 90 someone is looking out for the hedgies i can understand 1 trading halt but the two that followed didnt make sense
motley fool been real quiet i wonder why they were so fast with all the hit pieces and even released 4 articles in one day at one point
this is a war between the people and the greedy institutions we the people shall win toghere were bigger than any bank in the world
big support at 35 then 34 only way to go is up
puts are still looking very very expensive sell now
wrote 30 18 strike 1224 expiration calls for 033 early this morning and put almost 1000 premium in the pocket for 3 and 12 days will wait to write for another 15 callsjust saying no problem if those 18 strike calls get exercised

gamestop is up 4890 to 9680
guess i made the right call buying more shares after er when the price dropped and all those selling made the wrong call good luck to us longs
sell limit to 1000 keep holding folks diamond hands
right now all those smart people that bought puts are losing it
im not satisfied with the short sellers loss of 33 billion i want them to lose at least another 5 more billion
honestly the stock is holding up pretty well considering they reported a 30 drop in revenue which is on to of last years q3 decline of 25 there aren’t many retailers that can see 55 of their sales disappear and still be in business
big picks big winners every week that’s how i turned things around from losing trades my secret weapon is httpthetraderguidecom join them today
following this news i don’t see this returning to below 20 anytime soon  have just reloaded with more here at 1925  glta
i told someone a while back when they where happy about selling at 850 it was a mistake but they said it would not go up more i was on here when timmy boy sold at 650 and told him it was a mistake and again i am tell all of you dont sell because this is just the warm up rounds
gme will close above 15 today my best guess just saying

citron trying to sleep tonight
rsi over 60 short are buying
making money on this was so easy all you had to do was follow the overwhelming hype i bought in at 19 bears make it so difficult for themselves
i almost bought a bunch of game stop when it was 500 but all the analysts and the news and the experts were all screaming about how its going bk so i didnt completely forgot about it until i look today and see it beat the precovid high perfect
if we can hold green it will be chaos later for shorts
poor shorts today  gme trading in germany now above 85 usd at huge volume
don’t underestimate this stock and the power of short squeezes the only way i see this going down is when people start to lose interest and cash out on their profits but the way i see it with so many green traders trying to play a part in the fun there will be many holders who are reluctant to sell
second squeeze inbound
weird huge spike on the borrow fee
over 100 on monday is a sure thing
i’ve seen this before it will close around 38
longs on monday who bought gme at 74
early console sales in january someone big accumulating today icr conference change to tech ryan cohen radicalization of gme micheal burry predicting moass shorts underwater since 16 all the warnings are there and yet people still short this stock and think we are going too high or we going back to 16 i forgot how clueless people can be which caused the housing crisis in 08
i was busy doing something in the morning so i forgot to buy at 20 i was gonna invest 15k on it the train has left me
this is only the beginning
bull
150 and then 200
i guess just buy it maybe it goes to 100000
youre next bbby
anyway to check shares available to short if people keep paper handing not sure how high this can squeeze i may hold on and see though this will be interesting with such a high short interest  over 100
congrats to shareholders shorts ha ha
charts pointing to 59 and no resistance until 45
bubble  bubble   
reminder stock only goes up in bubblewhy are you still trying to think logically in an illogical marketjust put your money on a place you believe in and close your eyes
put holders spamming hoping for god to save them lmao
told you that this week it was going to hit 65i warned you shorts hahahahahahai love wsb
i cannot wait until the futures post monday night and then wait for the open on tuesday this is going to be a very interesting week i hope cohen and company have a major piece of news this could easily be 50 by the close on wednesday yahooooooooo go gme
if you were shorting this stock i think its safe to say you have a major problem on your hand
well i think a short just covered keyword “a”patience has won on gme
cramer really just threw shorts under the bus lol
people that still think that it has upside on what reason do you justfiy that in the history of gme this stock crash whenever it touch 60 be smart and sell when the short squeeze is over all the big guy are out will have big dump at the end of day just watch seen it to many time
it’s a spectacle i’m here to watch it unfold
great time for the shorts at 60 to cover dont be like your friends
after the 3rd quarter i thanked the person who sold me their shares for 1340 i said then it was like shooting fish in a barrel they will have 15 in cash at the end of this coming quarter cohen is looking to take controlling interest and the shorts are running scared 67 million shares short could open tomorrow at 24 january announcement on holiday sales which they already know will be much better than estimates shorts must cover by 24 or risk massive losses margin calls on shorts coming shortly good luck to all
congrats we are still early compared to what’s to come
after seeing gamestop tumble tomorrow with their failing business
gme to the moon 
where is the rally cry earlier in the morning cmon keep buying where u all go
i think now the news is public mr cohen will be able to buy again
q4 mean est is 173 and high est is 236 the sp will move to 1517 area soon

looks like citron research has to cover its lemonade short position cause the gme margin calls incoming dwill hit 200 soon
well at least we got rid of the weak hands now the true diamond hands get rewarded soon
citron at his new job after he realizes he isnt powerful enough to manipulate stock prices anymore
60 by next wednesday it might be today hahahahahaha shorts naked and broke
i took out a second mortgage and bought at 70 yacht or food stamps
in gme and wsb we trust
longs this is the war against shorts lets keep the squeeze goingbuy a couple hundred shares sell deep itm callsalthough you dont make a lot of money on the transaction but it dries the floating shares and keeps the buying pressure on shorts you will earn a lot on your couple thousands of long shares with the margin calls on shorts
the higher it goes the harder it falls this current price is unrealistic and can not be maintained
i cant wait to go to gamestop and get a new game on a cd i hate downloading stuff while im at the mall ill get an 8track tape at tower records and pick up a vhs movie at blockbuster bwahahaahaha
going in for more on opening we’re going to 1000 and shorts can’t do anything about it that’s why they’re crying in here
long time holder enjoyed the ride but i am out good luck to the longs but be careful up at these levels
still room to x2 from here if not x34 get in while the tendies are hot
i could see a pre owned digital future say you wanted to trade in a digital game you bought currently there is no option if continuing talks with microsoft and further opportunities arise why not allow digital trade ins its tied to your account all they would have to do is change your license to the game it would give gamestop digital pre owned inventory and allow for both digital store fronts to benefit by profit sharing potentially cornering the market on pre owned digital just a thought though logistics behind it might be a nightmare
we can make this go to 1000 do not sell your shares boys
only strong hands remain after a week
the market may potentially be red because of inauguration tomorrow all boats rise and fall with the tide this doesn’t change the fact that shorts still need to do the impossible market manipulation or not hold your shares wait for the big squeeze
still got a core position have traded it no fewer than 30 times in the last 7 days
the entire market is crashing
i love how burry says this short squeeze has to be done stealthily and with elegance i love itmarket manipulation at its finestdont be surprised to find out that everything was planned even his decrease in ownership percentage of the 5 threshold of gamestop so he doesnt have to report his trades definitely something brewinghttpsstpaulresearchcom20190905michaelburryannouncesnextbiginvestmentgamestop
here we go back in business
i bought more shares at 90 holding long this will shoot up to 400 soon maybe not today but it will happen very soon we just have to hold our positions and be patient
i am in tears here ffs 
do not sell i repeat do not sell the shorts are bombing the stock and liquidity is scarce at 40 we hit millions of new shares the squeeze has not started
finding resistance at 150
short squeeze

i did not know gamestop was still in business i mean nowadays everything is online streaming what is their business model

naked short selling should be illegal
anyone else wonder how dfv is doing  the 
obviously the moves gamestop is doing is not on any fundamentals not sure why u all deciding to pile in at once
im not long or short just enjoying the show
up over 1000 holy 
this fiasco is near an end only thing driving this is speculation
i boughtsold back in the teens but im super proud to see whats happening i bought a few shares in at the higher price now to support the cause and good luck longs
why are people acting as if the major hedge funds shorting this are the victims here these crooks did all they could to manipulate this stock in hopes of making it go bankrupt and putting thousands of employees out of work they deserve far worse than this and they will definitely get it next week
when reddit moves markets i’m not a short or a shareholder but this is hilarious to watch
careful now
gonna reitera what i said these bots are pathetic theyre getting real desperate trying to spam the yahoo finance a bunch of fake accounts that showed up only today to take a dump on our achievements dont sell were gonna go up further this is not a short squeeze like the media portrays it its a gamma squeeze a real short squeeze would settle at a pt of 400 more to come soon gme bulls hold onto your shares you wont regret
people saying this s old dont read newsits becoming an online shop with focus om e commerce and online salesdo your ddits everywhere
a reporter said gme had 141 short interest updated report will come soon but its probably above 100 still considering how much they doubled down httpsmobiletwittercomkgreifeldstatus1352719558327619585
if this ends above 60 therell be margin calls left and right and this thing will double on monday hold
the shorts only want one thingsell so they can meet their quotas and avoid the strike prices hold and this will moon they are blowing their ammo trying to shoot us down
what manipulation opens at the high of the day and falls significantly like last thursday strong open only to close negative we need to be able to hold the opening highs at the close come on gme lets get the news out soon
this was pure gamble to begin with not investing gambling might as well go down the street to a casino
0 gme short stock availability in ibkr right now  continue to hold down the front lines and to outlast the shorts and we ride to valhalla
never seen this before i took a stab at a put when gme was at 44 gme then ran to 60 and my put increased in value by 40 demand was so high for the puts i guess so i sold another put against it and locked in a profit havent seen crazy action like this since 1999
price getting manipulated in pre market again just hold your shares guys this has a lot more potential
omg trousers it’s going to 2490 and you sold 3500 at 618 bhwahahahahahahaha

bear trap you can see on i borrow that shorts are using the last free shares to push this down worst time to do this because the big companies have not yet covered sorry bears but this is going up mark my words
you were skipping school and hanging out at starbucks while the real players were making pay offs

gme running out of gas now down over 4 at 3815 hope it holds 38 markjust saying
buy at 21
anybody surprised this was up 100 in 2 days its normal to pull back you think things go in a straight line just look at the chart of any stock and youll see that nothing goes in a straight line sheesh whiners
remember my target 73 not 59 stay strong n stay safe
when should we start selling i feel like it may keep going up should we give it another week
consolidating in frankfurt around 40
gme leaked earning  positive  
back to 90 and then a slow fade back to 35 this was amazing but the party is over grab profits while you can wow i neglected to hit send on this when it had dropped from 159 to 117
100 next week short squeeze coming
shorts dealing w their increasing margin requirements
rumors of 150 million public offering after hours can anyone confirm

this is straight up manipulation but i couldnt be prouder of the wsb community maybe the dices arent rigged after all
i wonder how trousers feels he sold his entire position at 618 in early sept
today gme is the extreme example of casino stock no need to go to casino due to covid19 play safe with gme a small amount of losing money is a fun to play
this is sheer madness1000 at 565 1221pm out at 1229pm at 6052  
rip my fellow bears
i’m up on wallstreet and a short just jumped out of a building window
longs are banking their money on rc bringing gme back like they think a billionaire investor has never failed doing this blockbuster was backed by carl icahn and jc penny backed by bill ackman both of these companies failed keep dreaming longs httpsseekingalphacomamparticle4397264gamestopiscigarbuttandlastpuffiscoming
i think it will crash today from 400 to 100  
volume is another enemy of the shorts here they do not want to get in a volume war high volume for an extended period of time favors the longs and is confirmation of the squeeze pattern
guess up it is xd
imagine being the people that shorted 700k shares yesterday at 16 a share and not covering then you wake up today and see that gme has gone up to 19 a share hahahahaha
more like andrew left the building
bye bye bubble
shorts are done for now we have been on mad money  start covering now you have been warned
oh well guess more puts
it will take 6 days for shorts to cover think about that before selling today
can’t wait until the market crashes 80 then all the new kids will know they’re not in control
funny to see the more experienced wsb guys use the newbies to pump up the price and then sell from under them they realize one thing you have to close the position to actually make a profit
next run up stock will be gigm just starting low float
shorts begging you to go and have a look at other stocks haha hold strong boys
this is done look at today’s chart volume spike and deflation it’s unlikely there will be a secondary short squeeze
i am shorting for 2k not too worried lol only gamble what you can lose
hear 3 million shorts tiny float going to look like gme shorts with next earnings domination gme hear
can someone explain this movement i’m tempted to buy puts because after some brief research it doesn’t seem like some board members and holiday sales warrant 150 increase
call me when they turn a profit
trading halted just hold
gamestop was a goner from the beginning
every michaelrlulz comment ever has been negative for every stock he has posted on he is sponsered 10 cent per post garbage
if i were gme i would issue some new shares soon before this goes back down to a reasonable level
monday opens at 78 and closing 98
important example to explain this unique example of gamestop short dilemma imagine a new company has an ipo and sells 100 shares for 10 each to each of three investors named a b and c total number of shares is 300 and the market cap is 3000 xy and z are three bearish short sellers x borrows 100 shares from a at a modest interest rate and sells it short for 10 to very bullish c y and z both wish to sell short 100 shares each but are unable to borrow shares yet they each are able to short sell 100 shares naked to bullish investor c for a similar 10 at this point a and b each own 100 shares and c owns 300 while xy and z are each short 100 shares in our gme example investor c represents institutions which currently own more than 100 of the shares along comes a new investor d think cohen who is rich and probably wants to buy the whole company or at least control it lets say d makes an initial purchase by buying out  100 shares for 25 margin calls are issued to xy and z x and y post more money but z cant afford it so his brokerage firm issues a market order to close the position z manages to have his short position closed at 50 however the new 50 price triggers more margin calls for x and y x still posts more money but y cant do so so once again the brokerage firm issues a market order to close the position however the only remaining seller other than d is person b and b wouldnt accept a powenny less than 100 now x is only remaining short and he gets a new margin call hes unable to post more money so the brokerage firm issues a market order to close the position but there are no shares to buy maybe at 100 the company is tempted to issue more shares via dilution but controlling investor d blocks that deal the only other investors who might sell is c but they are institutions who dont daytrade in such a case there truly is no limit to high a price that x can close out his position i see a real world similar short squeeze happening here at gamestop
when’s a good time to get in on this
21247k pre mkt volume interesting day ahead
hooold line

if we actually manage to end on this number next week will be 60 easythen 80 next week good bye shorts sorry i took all your money
slowly adding more to my short position and averaging up 401 right now with another 7k shares possible short above 45
simple question with earnings announcement next week do we see 10 stock price or 20 while 3rd quarter not very important compared to 4th this will either be a major buying opportunity or a short squeeze all depends on some positive news from earnings call not necessarily the actual results
these ppl talkin like gamestop is new version of tesla lol
what  of float is short
made a fortune

how shorts are feeling right now
ready for re fuelling 
hold till over 1000
lets get a late rally and close near 21
going downtrend the last one out is the last bad sheep
today 1209 the wsj reported short interest in gme as of 112920 amounted to 6798 million shares up slightly from two weeks ago  representing 130 of the float thats before any new shares being issued during those two weeks approximately 806 million shares exchanged hands on another matter gme appeared on the threshold securities list yesterday for the first time in a while godd luck
its a psychological game they showing you 100 so that you associate it with the benjamin dont fall for it1000 and no less
99 of people on yahoo finance think they are good at investing lol

holding and reloading last bought at 9524
to all the experienced investors on which page of your playbook do you have the scenario written out where you are fighting millions of rabid robinhooders all with individual access to their accounts whilst coming out of a pandemic induced recession we all have the same experience in this market
to the mooon and beyond 
the company is undervalued the shorts guarantee a nice payday if people hold the individuals holding the stock do not have the same demographic as the market at large the company is also protecting its shareholders lastly how much of this 2000 stimulus are people going to spend there its winter some lockdowns good demand for new consolespc parts and games huge advertising from the short action controversy
selling lets the shorts off the hook just buy and hold folks these ups are only 
now thats a huge drop
i think we hit 60 tomorrow
if i were a short i’d be hella scared right now
i think a lot of longs missing the point with the shorts most of the short sellers are fundamental traders they’ve crunched the numbers and decided even if gme goes 100 digital it still suffers extreme losses for a long time best case it takes a long time to turn around and make a profit after that the stock price still won’t be at reasonably valued at 40 for years they’re sticking it out and watching the numbers go up and down however many professional investors have pressure to meet profit expectations from the firm there’s only so much you can take so squeeze it may not be a short this week but it’s definitely a short this year or 2
just hold shorts have to cover
i told you the lids would jump in to save their brethren
this is the good stuff
paid shorters everywhere
unbelievable
no idea how the short volume was over 100 of outstanding shares but theyre going to pay holding through this wejust you wait
google volkswagen short squeeze  this is the exact same situation check it out

tan come to the good guy side we will welcome you with open arms u dont even have to admit u lost your shirt by shorting
not trying to pump just do some due diligence on mrsv severely undervalued based on revenue model

winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets but all that can change if you join the right program i joined up with these guys httpstockstrackercom now i am having solid picks every week
this is a 10 stock then down from there gme wont exist in a year
750 in 1 year
i’m not invested in this i just came here to say f the shorties and enjoy the gains bulls
this stock will be used as a example of stock manipulation in any future business courses or classes
is this the new hertz
how do you like this monday mr short hahaha
bought 5000 shares at 489 back in august of last year i’ll be selling my shares when the market opens at 100 thank u to gamestop to making me rich but i hope everyone else in the stock can be as fortunate and for the price to continue to go up glta
hold rezardz they are buying all our shares 
i told you guys this is only the beginning shorts i tried to tell you to cover
andrew left sipping something 
the experts and the financial media keep telling me to sell gme plug nio and pltr to name a few barrons has almost become the george costanza of investment advice where i just want to do the opposite taking nothing away from fundamentaltechnical analysis and trimming positions that have supposedly become overvalued or extended but up is up and down is down
every second they lose more money d
what will happen if amazon buys gamestop just my imagination
i knew gme would make a comeback but wasn’t expecting this lol i’m thanking sony and the ps5 for triggering all this exuberance and panic covering
holy cow the shorts are desperate there must be at least 50 new ones all screaming after they got taken to the back of the shed the market is closed this ah stuff at this point is just static noise next week is going to just be insane this will go down as the biggest short squeeze in history and will play out over the next few weeks also hope cohen doesnt say he increased his stake or there is good news because it might be a lot higher
serious question how many long term holders feel bad some off the short sellers are now broke serious question
i told you guys it’s gonna hit 60s today
hold the line huge short squeeze in 20 mins
guarantee you citron is on the phone calling and begging anyone and everyone to bail them out of their own scam buy and hold and if you have the means accumulate
where is sec 
got in in july for 397 oh baby what a beautiful day
get in
biggest pump and dump in recent history
reddit stocktwits and yahoo longs will squeeze the shorts dry watch the shorts get burned
i came here just to watch people yell at shorts
let’s go longs we are in control of this squeeze hold your positions and buy more i’m buying more shares as we speak shorts can not keep on shorting this stock they will have to cover eventually due to margin calls at a much higher price hope they realize that this is a losing battle for them at this point we are shooting for mars
have faith dont get scared itll drop off 12 as shorts and weak hands try to turn a page this has the potential to explode hint it hasnt yet
this thing is going to turned out bad
this will not end well wow
just like tlry bynd at one point  once shorts are covered will be cut in half or more immediately
here we go 50
im just here for the entertainment
remember that short amount was around the total outstanding reducing it 1015m should not be a major factor because you have an major investor who seems to be interested in the whole company thus if share price drops he could be a buyer this could limit how low it goes thus shorts are setting on dead money maybe waiting for takeover to limit their losses
shorts are scrambling like frogs in boiling water
lets gooooo
me watching the numbers go up while the shorters are just watching
easy buy here lots of margin calls overnight tomorrow gaps up huge as kodak did earlier this year
daddy cohen will deliver
not involved in any way in this and i am not planning tono matter how this enda in my opinion some consequences will appear at some point because of this it is not natural for a stock to go up and down like this with the only reason to buy and hold is that others have to buy  just an opinion
all aboard the tendy train
how best to short this
in my opinion short sellers create no value and shouldnt be saved by halting trading to me shorting stocks is not natural market behavior buy puts if you are betting for it to go downlongs that are massive believers call it delusional even have the power to actually save a business look at tsla there is so much cash to reinvest it will be actually hard not to fail now i think investors that believe in the essence of the business model in their blood and guts are what this whole thing is all about i think people that make money by destroying arent worth the air they breathe do something that createsgo longs for all companies
gapped to 8200

amc is the next gme huge short squeeze coming
350k short shares covered before 0915 and allegedly an upgrade by and possible new institution purchase hedgeye in the mix gonna be an interesting day
just bought some 22 pits for 319 cannot understand how this price would possibly be sustainable if it couldn’t be maintained in 2016 especially with the new console systems transitioning away from discs how could this company possibly grow
hold you shares long price target for us should at least be 400 although this can potentially shoot up to 1000 don’t fold by selling too early diamond hands
market broken
all these boomers in here complaining furrowing their brows in a vain attempt to understand the situation
i missed this one but i am definitely rooting for the longs here we all hope it sky rockets into the 100s and stays there no one likes citron and their cronies  left has gotten away with too much and have caused a lot of damage to smaller investors redemption simple supply and demand here 100s could happen
this stock really feels like tlry before the jump from 20 to 300 on the back of the shorts
here’s the vicious cycle people are still trying to short then instantly panic and buy back that’s why this scenario doesn’t stop when people think it will it’s still getting started
to anyone whos unaware look up wallstreetbets on reddit its just a whole bunch of people whove agreed to all keep buying and holding gamestop shares that has directly led to their sp increase its actually pretty crazy
thumbs up if reddit4chan8kunq brought you here comment if you are a short
shorts are so trapped good luck covering higher prices coming to a gamestop near you cohen on the board will push for a massive online presence and trimming stores will lead to profitability shorts gunna get scorchedt
do not sell this will continue to squeeze if everyone holds
wsb is a reddit that is pumping this stock this is not based on fundamentals not based on technical analysis this is a pump and a dump has yet to follow know what youre getting into ps leader of wsb deserves to be arrested

i dont know where this goes tomorrow but if it happens to tank 20 points it will be the funniest thing ive seen in the market for a long time mainly because of all the upset parents when their reddit children have to delay moving out of their basement when they blow up their 5k accounts lol

theyre dropping it on purpose the corruption
ive never seen anything like this
buying tons under 40 bucks

100 today
the longs who hold will be greatly rewarded stay strong gme bulls
hold 1000 is target and teach those shorts a lesson
the shorts are losing their shorts
casino this is not investing
bears are running out of hit pieces to publish and shares to short and cohen hasnt even had to help its a matter of time its an honor to hold with all of you 
gains it is obvious earnings will be bad and maybe worse than expected however free cash flow lower debt repurchased and the future strategy will be priced in after the q3 announcement call today and tomorrow are meaningless with those items on the table i would bet the cohen has people lined up to ask pertinent questions related to their future strategy and what the msft engagement means financially and strategically going forward i am anxious to see what wednesday brings or after hours tomorrow
booooommmmmm
next resistance 105
it’s the last opportunity for shorts to buy low margin calls will push them to buy at a lot higher price it’s time for us longs to be rewarded for our patience and conviction let’s hold long for the biggest short squeeze of the decade
the squeeze has just started it will unwind fully next week

shorts trapped in a living nightmare in gme lol also pick up some dmyd spacbefore the merger with genius sports
matt ive told you numerous times ive never shorted this stock so i have never lost money on this company its just too flakey it goes up on fluff it goes down on fluff its just a gamble even now with cohen its fluff as he has announced zero actual roadmap or plan what he has said so far is no more than what has been said many times before on this board i laugh because years ago i was saying gmes future was dying if it continued to base its business on selling 2nd hand discs all the perma bulls were in denial about that now heres the laugh now that rc is saying the same things hes a genius and perma bulls are in agreement if you are making money because of a squeeze based on fluff then great ive no beef with that until cohen has positive plans and sustained positive results its still fluff however one thing is a cert gme aint going to be the dominant company in gaming in the future those days of its heyday are long gone
just in alex left injured while cutting grass live stream put off till tomorrow
omg o
easy 400 today with this pace
check out acst going to run harder than gme
no worries shorts the more longs the better the low today before citron delayed the cast suggested exactly how nervous the stock was i will take this opportunity and add more in the 42s if the pumpers can get it there longs are really getting sucked in deeper and deeper if gme closes down today and the markets rollover tomorrow shorts will be well positioned for some panic selling do your job longs pump pump pump this non profit
ahaha  big win for the 
hold over weekend
this is competing with nio in terms of stock price today
1000 hold long boys
the short squeeze hasn’t happened yet the shorts are now trapped a huge call order was purchased at the eod today for 40 do not short this we don’t want to hurt you also buy this stock and hold till you see 500 gains the shorts must eventually close their positions and that means the only place the stock is going is up
on monday it gapped to 44 ya think it will gap to 48 tomorrow lets hear yous numbers i say 48
after all those hit jobs the stock is holding if i was a short i would be scared
this companys problem is not revenue its actually utilizationthey have made 1b each of the last 3 quarters but as u can see their earnings has improved quarter after quarterso they are doing a good job of using there expenses wisely now compared to what they did in the pastits only gonna get better from here
wow a few desperate shorts on now hold the line

a close above 20 sets the stage for a run to 27 they are going to have a huge announcement in early january not just to note the increase in sales but something more strategic setting the stage going forward cohen did not increase his position because of future stagflation something up his sleeve
do not sell hold no matter what we are going to 1k
should stabilise here and bleed up
i bought 13 cause i support the cause
i see the short position in gme as a dream for hedge funds since we are talking about a billion or two dollars involved an amount many can handle once the business is more stabilize they will become involvedjust like the shorts push down the price artificially they would be able to maintain or increase the price to the detriment of the shortsthe shorts will either have to pay the price or sit on major lossesjust a matter of time
if you buy sharesyou can hold them a long time at no extra costthe predator shorts have to continually pay lots of interest  to keep their shares short soldno freaking way for shorts to leave their expensive positions without paying us as long as we hold strong
shoot citron canceled what should i do with my puts
what do you think it means when puts r going up as the stock is going up look out below even the market makers r scared 
we are one big announcement away from a 50 run up

trousers i get pure joy in knowing that when you copy my picture to update your clone handle it will remind you that you left 113000 on the table you sold 3500 at 618 in april and it went to 3865 today i can’t stop laughing about that
said it before i am not selling unless cohen sells if you sold today thats on you but in a few months you will be crying because you sold shorts will be crying because i along with many other longs held and forced them to sell their house to buy back 67 million shares short
bum here maybe ill settle for 20 to 25sbum badly wants some correction to pick up those shares back a bit iffy about 25s to 30s 30s to 35s is a dangerous zone i am a decent sized player but prolly if i wasnt so greedy i should have bought her back in the 12s to 17s instead of bashing how overpriced it was in the 18s and 19s before the squeeze but i know how easy it is to fk up a big trade which as a reflection happened last week
short get ready
some of y’all ain’t ever studied the years 1929 and 1987 and it shows
they try so hard dont blame themonce it is momo stock it will take a bear market to change the momentum
forget the moass can we just get a regular short squeeze ffs
so let me understand this correctly you shorts borrow at 29 percent or higher to make 10 percent or less
i would at least like to finish over 20 today that would be good leading into the rest of the week
its been a crazy week gme gang stay strong and well fly again tuesday anyone got an estimate for a short squeeze price target

stop halting the inevitable
question for the option experts out there there are millions of in the money gme puts that are due to expire on friday assuming they remain in the money upon expiration and are therefore exercised where does the put owner get the shares to sell at the strike price will they have to go out in the open market purchase the shares  sell them to the seller of the put or is it just a cash transaction where the put is exchanged for cash any information will help thanks

is this short squeeze a long term strategy  if someone can hold their short positions forever when this game wears off they should recover
i’ve muted so many people here for confirmation bias that i can’t tell if the hatersshortstrolls all ran away or if it’s just a quiet day

all the boomers after citrons presentation
so now gme is volkswagen a worthless daytrade short squeeze even with way more longs
i’m definitely going to straddle dude there’s no other choice
oh my god i am in 2000 shares at 1678 holy 
43 bears be like
the shelf registration the gme is putting in place is likely a nonevent many companies put them in place and never use them i see two possible uses for the a potential capital raise 1 a situation where covid gets out of control and seriously impacts gme business where they need to raise capital to pay down imminent debt or 2 where gme’s stock rises dramatically and they use the opportunity to issue shares at an elevated level to finance the business tesla put in place a shelf offering in may 2019 and is about to use it a second time later this month to sell more shares to the market this filing is a smart move by gme management imoin looking at the november sales numbers at first glance a 165 comparable store sales increase does not seem that impressive but when one realizes the first 9 days before the first consoles where actually sold were likely running similar comps to the prior quarter at only 75 of prior year sales then considering gme stores were closed for thanksgiving that would mean that sales the other 20 days of the month were running at a 3540 increase in comparable store sales to last year to arrive at the 165 positive comp pretty impressive something for everyone to think about when considering this earnings release
not selling
up a penny premarket shorts better cover
order book looking good keep it  60 we have the high ground
lol “trash stock straight to 20” mmkay 
shorts are done
maybe andy left is mad he didnt get a ps5

welcoming 40
how many people in this forum shop at gamestop the store near me closed i buy all my games at amzn and bby now
gamestop has its mojo back digital sales up 300 and the pandemic isnt even close to being over for another year
bought too many options too high i was up 20k for the day gonna use this as a learning lesson not to get greedy
so this is what a short squeeze looks like oh man somebody’s but it’s gonna be herton
where is the guys who said epic squeeze 50 etc today ddd
in the entire history of wall street there has never been a stock this shorted at 140 of the float there is nothing more shorted over the last 229 years since the start of wall street let that sink in for just one moment
here comes 42
guys im shaking this is insane and its notnot even the squeeeeeeze
this is exactly like kodk i want this to go to 100 and then buy naked puts 10 put and not check my account for 6 months
time to offload and take profit
death to the shorters
quite the illustration of a short squeeze would like to see the cnbc heads discuss this they wont
omg citron is totally bankrupt
new to having extra funds to play with stock just starting to get into it but on speaking more to the bulls when the stock is down or up they are always saying hold hold buy more etc this can create false hope for newbies trying to come into the game to figure out how this all works saying super high numbers like it will be 60 by eow or will hit 200 by eom on what facts when you have little people trying to get in the game see this and then when tomorrow comes what you said is way wrong at that point its like throwing money away where not everyone can afford to do try to be a bit more factual and realthis false hope of what the numbers will be and they dont get there is confusing for new entries
wo ist das herr cohen 
so much profit taking just now lol ouch
quick conspiracy theory andrew left talking trash and then a lot of big players buy and leave shorts broke maybe
as i said earlier sell on 100 increase 1015x volume buy back on the dip
one has to wonder why the big opening was it because of great on line sales or a better third quarter than expectedwhat ever it was we will find out shortly
shorts are throwing money at sharesany price will do
bb or amc next
never too late get your rope out and tie on to the rocket
you guys see ryan cohens tweet these cryptic tweets about gme have me feeling some kind of way
i think wall street has figured out how to bring this down they are going to halt trading and short it all the way down massive sells going through before each halt be careful
record highs with record losses unpayable national debt a ccp installed prez we are in interesting time
if 160 of the float is owned by institutions and 130 is shorted then what the hell is trading every day there should be no shares left well that’s just a commons question asked but we all know most shares traded don’t exist
craziness
i have 600 shares and will be selling soon before the sell off
literally cannot go ttis up    
sorry shorts you should of covered on that dip you’ll pay up now
httpswwwreuterscomarticleusvolkswagenshortsellersmakevwtheworldspriciestfirmidustre49r3i920081028
cohen saving his tweet till monday to send us to valhalla
ytd up 300 wow people come and buy
reaching 73 today and then 98 next friday dont challenge my charts
squeeze has barely begun look at short interest lots of margin calls coming today for shorts hopefully 70’s eod and next week who knows could be seeing the beginning of greatest short squeeze in history
when you visit any gamestop store its a sorry situation with lack of customers and there are no new merchandises on the shelf it looks like a disaster but the stock keeps going up and its pure manipulation someone is going to get hurt very bad and stay away from this junk stock
last chance to board the rocket
wow  gme was 17 on jan 2nd up 500 as of now congrats to all that were in it prior  those that chase this head shake
the shorts are going to cover in mass today or some of these funds that are short will bleed themselves dry when the market opens they will be climbing all over themselves to get out
i love that gme longs beat the system all retail investors salute you good for the wsb guys who are absolutely hilarious however ive always read bulls make money bears make money but pigs get slaughtered
price target 75  100 150 200 500

selling at 140 allows reentry at 100 that’s not too bad greed wipes out a lot of potential profit
today was nice citron should do another video tomorrow
andrew left is never right lol
thank you chris for the short availability listbut as long as gamestop appears on the threshold list does it make any difference what the short availability is if you can naked short the stock with no limits
cítrous and melvins will next shortamazon and berkshire hathaway for profit

utter madness good luck though
hold you degens 
8k shorts left were winning
if youve been in the game long enough youll know youre supposed to do the opposite of what citron says

omg some people are going to get hurt badly

did they halt the stock
sports gambling and gambling in general is restricted but anyone can gamble in the stock market this is kinda scary though i’m probably just watching from the sidelines how high does it his go and how hard and fast does it crash
dont forget they are announcing a mid quarter earnings report in jan if they were a failing company they wouldnt do it they paid off 100 million in debt so clearly theres a turn around good things come to those who wait i bought chewy at 25 went all over the place and finally sold at 108 to buy gme give it time
gamestop execs can end this ponzi scheme by selling millions of shares
ive never seen more crazy people buy up 1000 from the lows when they have no margins and are like blockbuster video eventually 30 breaks 20 breaks 10 breaks
they thought they could drop it to trigger stop losses diamonds
keep holding don’t let the director who sold shares scare you he’s getting kicked out of the board when they’re reducing the board seats this summer and he’s not happy
at this rate 50 is not out of the question
not to mention the organized bear attack at exactly 150  so  obvious just keep holding another buy chance
skt short sellers scared will have to cover or pay dividend
bummer i have to keep adjusting my chart to see how high it is going
we’re off to the racesagain
59 is confirmed lets go and then see
whos selling lol
buy stock no options hoarding more stocks will have this thing rocketbuckle up butter cup

hey andy its not a tech issue no one wants to join your failed thesis on gme

shorts are folding keep on holding longs we have momentum and this will shoot way up be patient be strong we have the upper hand hold your positions don’t sell let’s go
is that bad again
2 min till takeoff
i feel sorry for folks who follow citron research i visited their twitter and website for the first time pure noisemaker this lone guy is throwing targets left and right by reading morning tea leaves just to see what sticks there is no credibility i cant see who in their right mind would take this guy seriously at least kramer makes it obvious that he exists for entertainment purpose citron guy is simply annoyance
view this as a discount and buying opportunity
inauguration and a funeral for the shorts on the same day amazing
the infinite short squeeze continues 
can you imagine gme is priced as shopify2000
remember rc still has this nukehttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardata0001326380000132638021000006gme20210111htm
rc already built one amzncrushing categorykiller machine in chwy no reason why he cannot do the same here
can anyone even find a stock that is over 100 with the float shorted in the last 100 years
gamma squeeze the real squeeze is next week when the shorts need to cover unlucky paper hands
when all the stop loss trigger this isnt going to end welllol did gme sell drug  highest stock price in its history
search on secgov questions and complaints from there you can select to file a complaint with the ombudsman to find out why gme has been on the securities threshold list beginning dec 8 2020 through jan 13 2021 which exceeds the regulation sho 17 cfr 242200 delivery and closeout requirements
halt it again so the shorts can find shares right
this is abnormal price this is the highest price of the history of gme when gem was big and profitable when there is no other ecommerce company if you look at level 2 you will know that this stock destined to crash
i just bought an additional 1k shares now the more we buy the higher the short squeeze goes citron is going to get slaughtered andrew left will never be right citron will get slaughtered this time around
what a ride today
i’m nearly certain this is going back down but shorting involves buying back shares at the end and this is not a good company to own at anything above 30 so closing a short position in such a bad company is the tricky part
halted again mm trying to help their shorts buddies with an escape route punish those greedy novalue family destroyer shorts
reddit was here
 when you have lost sight of reality  this is the poster child
another halt
sec rule 201 has been put into action shorts will have a hard time supressing the buying pressure from jan 15 to jan 20  takes effect at 15h03 on jan 15 tuesday we blow the lid off of the shorts companies wont be able to borrow stocks to sell them short sellers will be restrained
i bought 29 gme shares  453 – wish i had bought more it was the first investment ive ever made on the stock market and am still a beginner and am proud to be learning upwards also invested 13 shares in tna when it was trading  2999 and now its worth around 8500 ive invested in a handful more that are all in the green and my portfolio has grown 225 since april when i started lets keep going
finishing over 60
btw forgot to mentiongamestop has gone up over 150 in the last 6 months on back to back negative earning quartershmm sounds good to mecould u just imagine once they blow out earnings which will happen this quarter or next
retail shorts starting to see the writing on the wall this is nothing big boys covering sends this well into triple digits over multiple daysweeks
lol everyone saying to hold is biased because they hold stock of course they don’t want you to sell me idc what you do at the end of the day lol gamestop is doomed no matter how you feel about the situation you call me crazy now but you’ll see in the long term
what’s going on
shorts will burn worse here than gme this company has life saving answers
it was a good run but insiders sold off over 20m in the past week i am out
alright i’m in let’s go
with everything opening up red there will be profit taking at this price then the real selling will start until it bottoms
read 14 million call options bought today if they execute those options that will probably drive the price higher if that is how it works price wont go up until they execute the options this is one for the history booksit caught the shorters and then those that came in and shorted after the first runupwow
secondary offering at 22 next week is probable
2230 today 
100 soon
is this a good stock with a future because of ryan cohenor is it a tanker like barons said this weekend
yess keeep shorting it new shorts gonna be left holding the bag for institutions
sooooon may the tendie man come
bought 5 shares just to join the party let’s go 
 massive gme type reddit driven short squeeze of the decade is coming to o’ll rmo due your own due diligence  see
has it halted
do not sell longs this is a coordinated bear attack hold the line
i bought 3 puts that expire this week everyone and i’m telling you everyone is going to take their profits i should have straddled instead of putting but whatever
don’t listen to the shorters they are trying to scare retail we have the power
about to run
open 78 and closing 98 i see 124 coming load up the shares n calls
this is why we bought all that up at 13 it was foretold cheers
to be clear at the moment there are more shares being shorted than their are shares never seen anything like it panicporn 2020 is apparently dry humping the early rounds of 2021 as well

bears haha when is that squeeze coming you keep saying tomorrow tomorrowandrew left beargoblin stream tomorrow nope tomorrow again

who cares about anyone that is short here the sec has not done their job and enforced against illegal naked shorting they helped create this situation by letting the big boys prosper thru illegal trades now they need a way out don’t feel sorry for any of the crooks

monday december 7 top watch bb tomorrow will be year highs 10 gap up this is the newest monster gme earnings tuesday ah so my guess is a run up to 18 before falling flat ears offering4 closed friday with game changing otc covid news pt 15 eoy

green day in the overall market but gamestop is down totally legit and not manipulating look at the volume too shorts are using this to drop gamestop dont panic just hold
200 eod if we all just buy and hold do you not want money
look at all these shorts be gone this stock going to 100 minimum

this company could go to 200 or 20 on monday and i would be like “yeah that makes sense”
gme is the bitcoin of stocks
hold strong ah don’t give in to the 
andrew left with the reverse guh
to think that this stock will 100010k when the real short squeeze starts get in while you still can
as a frequent gamestop customer 10 years ago i stopped going theres no reason to you are forced by major platforms to purchase from their nintendo playstation store any other accessories can be bought on amazon target and walmart gamestop is really just a pawn shop for old games now
not selling not a chance
back to 100 now this week 1000 next week 10000
no paper hands allowed diamant hands will be rewarded to 30
this guy tweets a stock is going to go down then shorts the stock and makes millions and millions this is 100 market manipulation he gets burned 1 time and now hes crying like a baby after years and years of cheating with the sec turning a blind eye to these market makersnow i will join reddit and pop 10 grand in my cash account for the next left squeeze bahahahaha
i think not being long the stock at 17 was more painful than shorting this at 17 bum aint happy he aint caught on but i dont think anyone would have known that todays judgement day for shorts
cohen has stated that he wants them to focus on e sports which would be a smart move as it is expected to grow exponentially why not invest in several small game studios to create content specifically for your store front this would fit inline with the esports model and we all know how micro transactions work there is potential its just a matter of grabbing it by the hair and going to town
chewy’s revenue increase 45 while still losing money it’s price to sales is 41gamestop ecommerce was up i believe 200 yet it sales to price 251 using chewy’s ps ratio on gamsstop ecommerce business alone would give it a value of over 3b or over 40 per share
diamonds hands here for the weekend 
this tarp was about to out of business i used to own and sold for small gain deeped it badly after i sold which made me feel so good but now its fake price is booming like a bubble it will go down all the way to around 10s i will start put my put order once it hit 90 there is possible to climb for very short term with very high risk ready to short this so badly
tomorrow the mood in this room will be just opposite of today

this what the fed created
congratulations longs i almost bought this at 12 and didnt a few months back 
shorts are rabid on hereand bleeding profusely
i sold
what a lot of people dont understand is that this company is being valued as an ecommerce business more and more with ryan cohens influence look at the valuations not the stock price it doesnt matter if it was 2 at covid the company had an enormous cash balance and was a complete steal at 2
prch thank me later
support at 368 we are in good hands just buy
sold my calls yesterday 
andddd it’s gone
love all the youre going to lose everything reactions when its still up 40 on the day after 3 halts im sure some of the shorts covered today thats the only reason for it to spike up to the 70s but this is going to happen again next week its just inevitable
folks sell before market open and clock out our profit register itsgonna drop heavy on monday market open mark my words says my 20yrs experience good luck this will apply some reverse breaks today
just added more shares  dorectly after it goes up in the eu
lol it jumped 10 in pre market now 7 up 
arent you comforted to know that stock prices have no relationship with reality they got divorced years ago makes me really want to buy stock what a great place to bet your future
one word of advice for longs who have never witnessed this dont get talked into being greedy and hold your stock all the way up and all the way back down the notion of buy and hold does not make sense in this situation because gme may never see these highs again there is no way to know where the top is so pick out a price youre happy with and sell part of your shares hoping the rest will go higher dont get frustrated by not selling at the top no one but a few liars will do so you have already done great even if you sell here seems likely to be higher tomorrow and may continue into next week for a few days good luck

wonder how many short positions are going to be closed on open tuesday youre all about to give me all your losses in gains
i haven’t heard one valid reason to short gme from any short they are bottom of the food chain simpletons
the short squeeze hasnt happened yet even when it does it wont happen in a day you will always sell higher waiting for just after the true peak than trying to predict it before hand and selling they said all of this at 20 30 35
above 100 
i dont normally post but i wanted to add a comment after seeing the citron announcement that dropped the stock regardless of citrons motivation for criticizing gamestop just research citrons track record they were short tessla until they werent certainly citron may share valid points tomorrow but it will not mean they are right about this stock gamestop will reach above 60 before it potentially touches 20 more and more investors are buying gamestop and holding while short sellers are feverously trying to cover bit by bit not selling my shares in the near future glta
in for another 100  3750that was a good dip but stocks only go up keep buying
will explode higher tomorrow be patient more gains to come
it’s going to a crazy wild day this one and gme tells me that index fund bubble will finally bust pretty pretty soon and the money from there will come into all good small caps that are deeply undervalued for different reasons including massive short bets
its pretty simple if you made a ton of money going long why not make a ton going the other way

melvin capital hq
this is a wild ride
the bears are trying hard to scare people i know one thing  this is the most shorted share you practically can findif we just hold a roman line  in the end the barbarians will fall  even if we loose some days  just hold the  line  they made the mistake to overshort it  that is their problem  we will have several guys trying to manipulate the shares  this happens when you are in the eye of the stormjust stay calm and squeeze them out 
feels a lot like when it was around 40 hodl
is gamestop the new tesla
omg trousers it hit 2235 a full 16 per share above where you sold 3500 in sept 56000 bro that is 500 a day every day since you sold
jump in  its pay day and puts are burning
hold or buy more 
be careful shorting here this could double before it drops
hold you shares we can do it short will have to cover eventually and they will he fcked
fresh squeezed whos thirsty
omg the shorts wont be able to sleep or enjoy the weekend wonder how much citron would lose on this trade the fundamentals are broken right now i think that the stock is really overvalued but i do think that the price will go much higher next week with massive short squeeze really interesting to watch
so what was the reason behind the run anyone knows
a smart board would dilute the stock over the weekend pay down debt and beef up online sales short term impact but best solution long term this is a once in a lifetime for them to pay the banks
when do we hit the first circuit breaker
alot of the gap needs filled before next wave above 40 it will happen this week
market manipulation pre market don’t get scared
oh boy premarket up and down but some one is holding the stock above 40￼ to make big for profits from the upcoming squeeze￼
guys can you please tell me whats going on with this stock for the past few days any news 
i wonder how many of the multitudes of short sellers were savvy enough to cover their position during the latest sell off looks like they missed the boat next stop 20 per share and beyond
citron getting tilray flashbacks i guess when they shorted it  25
time to buy for short squeeze action
i’m reading that was just margins getting called and there’s probably going to be upward movement all next week  not sellin
i dont think the people selling have heard the phrase buy low sell high we literally just saw 43 and theyre like lets sell at turdy ate dollers
wow many millionaires here 
theres going to be a lot of forced covering or people having to put up a lot more to maintain margin requirements gme bbby and amcx will all see this activity today as the shorts begin to panic and the prices go higher and higher
ooh its gonna be so funny when this bubble will explode 
only 6m volume in pre 200m fri this is going to tank soon and leave alot of bagholders this week
hmm for some reason i feel bad for you shorts y’all about to lose a lot of cash over the next few weeks
i’m scared
buy gevo great stock look at gme 140
soon institutional investors will have you all shorts longs middles
citron is a scam never intended on hosting a call
this is beautiful
just sold 10500 shares thank you gme just paid off my student debt
will be buying more tomorrow morning as the usual profit taking takes place
i warned shorts last month to cover this is just the beginning
still so many shorts lmao when will yall learn
wsb has nowhere near enough capital to move a ticker this much how are you still in denial that this is a short squeeze and short sellers still have to scramble to close more positions 200 before 129
get in quickly before it busts out of the 30’s and into to the 40s 50s and 60s
i was correct we hit 75
qs went from 20 to 130 in a little over a month gme will likely repeat this feat and exceed it
and for all longs dont be mad you did not sell at 38 this is going much higher wait and see cohen is going launch a take over in 6 months
theyll try to scare us with drops like that just an opportunity to buy more we will prevail 
we bouta take off 
we will never sell diamond hands baby
when will we hear from management
lunch time squeeze will resume this afternoon
no more shares availablemargin calls happening as we speak
i just dump all my money into this
i have been telling everyone on this board cohen left 15 billion on the table by selling chewy too early this is just the beginning for him here he will push this to a 100 stock in one year keep praying shorts but you are screwed hahhahhahhahahahah
stimulus money will only add more fuel to the longs buying will definitely increase get ready for more squeezing shorts we will hit triple digits very soon
citron live you can follow on twitter ughhh
half of this board doesnt even know what a short squeeze is they are just spewing what they heard from their last youtube video
nice and easy lads
play book next step 10 per share and possible bankrupcy
so all i have to do is not to sell easy
it may not close above 20 today however it will this week
quick history of the vw squeeze it happened after porsche announced they bought up 74 percent of common shares it happened over two days price came right back down you are not going to see a vw like squeeze with this company lol
while ive read some reassuring dd before jumping on board all the positive info leading into the future is irrelevant right now this is a unique situation with about 19 million people on reddit working towards a common goal hard to believe this is just the beginning but its happening kind of like how huge amounts of people have been able to will bitcoin into being worth 40k the people want gme to be worth more and so it will be jump aboard

people comparing gme to blockbuster are forgetting that if they had vision blockbuster could have been netflix or something like it blockbuster had the name the recognition and at one point the cash to pivot and change into a more successful model they didnt and the technology passed them by along with its market thats clearly not happening with gme they are adjusting to a more user friendly model whether it works or not is of ones opinion but simply put they expanding into digital space which is exactly what blockbuster did not do not to mention the short squeeze this is an easy winner
shorties build fak wall at 41 will not hold this opens 45 up

long and strong
not even sure what it is with this stock to make me even post on a message board it is rare doe me to post but i am like a bee to honey on this something to do with these jackals always trying to screw the little guy with their manipulative tactics of naked shorting negative analysis and negative posts deep down i know the other side of my trade is dirty and they will stop at nothing to collapse the price they have been doing this in the market since the beginning and just fleecing the little guys deep down i want them to pay for every investor they made sell to scoop up cheap shares or buy to only unload their junk at this point i dont even care if i lose it all as i believe in the future and wont be scared of these tactics anymore

let’s go longs the squeeze is alive hold your positions shorts are doomed horrible idea to hold their short positions over the weekend gme to the moon
this would’ve been up so much if it wasn’t for manipulative citron smh
pre market profit taking could get ugly
if you want to make them scream start buying heavy after hours today and don’t sell the open tomorrow
shorts dont want to reveal their who who get a braziian haha hahah
there are tons of people on reddit wallstreetbets posting screenshots as proof of them buying this stock when it was 5 10 15 and not only are they still holding but they are still buying a historically rare occasion for the little guys to be in control of the market at least for one stock lol presented to us only because of institutional greed that was ready to bankrupt a company and eliminate jobs for a profit i bought more at 42 today and i anticipate it will be higher by the time i have more available cash at which point i will still be buying this is going to peak at unthinkable prices and literally the only limit to its potential is us selling for profit thus saving the shorts if others can hold despite some already having 8x return so can you just visit reddit if youre feeling weak and see how many people are in this together its honestly inspiring lol
do you know what’s worse than being short gme today nothing
buying 350 more at the open
calling it when it hits 45 citron will delay it until tomorrow
shorts on here are getting desperate take a break from commenting chumps rest up over the weekend because today was just a preview of whats going to happen to you next week
big gains still to come x24 from here
even with the move from 21 down to 17 it’s still 150 higher than trousers 618 early september liquidation that’s how bad he is at this even when he’s making money he’s losing three times more
now that there are shorts from 4060 they basically set a new floor right so theoretically before it hits the price it was yesterday there will be people starting to buyno reason not to hodl
raise your hand if you bought at 45
shorties try to push down we push up citron is a scam shorting should be illegal you can vanish companies and leave people unemployed citron you should go completely bankrupt you failed with tesla you failed with square you failed with shopify you are going to fail with gamestop because we people retailers have the power we are simple people not rich wallstreet guys do you know mr chanos he won with elron and so many people lost their jobs people suicide but he got a good lesson by elon musk and tesla enough is enough mr theft not left you are dealing with simple people and we have the power
remove stop losses so they cant trigger it
destroyed resistance get ready for a breakout to 36 and beyond
hold the line steady
okay here is some short term due dilligence without getting into the details a group called melvin capital are balls deep in puts in the low 20s that expire at the end of the week and coming weeks so they have to buy back to cover their shorts soon their problem is 20 is held by the board of gme 20 is held by institutions basically melvin might be having a stroke right now if you can hold for another week you’ll see a lot of upside
i bought puts on friday lmao
unlike most stocks the higher this gets the safer it is who is selling  the short interest alone is security as the price goes up not to mention the true potential of gme with the current changes being made no matter how you cut it this is a great buy
wow  nice gains guys when u cash in bring some over to pltrand ride with usglta
crazy fun
time to get out or keep holding i’m trying to pay for nursing school y’all lol
dont let the shorts fool you they are trying to push down the price out of the 40 strike hold your shares were gonna go on a fun ride
let’s go longs citron has no balls to even come through with the much anticipated pathetic livestream for the desperate shorts not much hope there shorts time for you to raise the white flag and start covering your losses gme is only going to shoot up from here on you can’t stop this rocket ship’s momentum better step aside or you’ll get run over and get burned
people that don’t sell today will regret monday just mark this post they will do stock offering and insiders will be selling shares
whens the last time you bought a hard copy of a game partnering with amazon to sell hard copys online wait
gme is still super undervalued with 6b in sales and a bright future
gamma at inflection point gonna be a bloodbath mondayall the hopes and dreams of these robinhooders of reaching escape velocity from their moms basement will be crushedbwahahahabye bye
realistically what would anyone expect on a price if and when a real short squeeze takes place would you think a 50 100 gain from here i know it may depend on q4 updates but assuming they are good what do you think
terrific perfectly timed updated analysis of gmes true value makes citron look even more like an oaf someone on our side has counteracted the  coming from all the other idiots being bought off by shortsto quote an idiot spoken of frequently on this board buy buy buy
remember this all happened by the greatest shorter of all citron once cohen announces a real catalyst it’ll be fun
there is no free lunch
200 in 30 minutes
dont sell until it hits 420
no one and i mean no one would post anything negative here unless they were short do not listen to them
had to wipe out all those stops i heard the buyout is around 42 good luck melvin capital
citron is a joke
its happening
look at rkt
gamblers will now be piling on wanting to cause a squeeze 100 of the float shorted 
day trader stock and not a real investment they are trading per day almost their entire shares outstanding this based on last 10 trading sessions once the robinhooders move on to the next  this is tanking
hey bears put your money where your mouth is and get shorting
will be red soon
keep adding msft needs them i see 59
all you shorts now clinging to left’s flaccid 20 valuation reasons regardless of the gme market fundamentals have found yourself in a terrible position “numbers don’t lie”  andrew left he didn’t even address the growth of ecommerce and the obvious fundamental changes that cohen and other experts in this area will will lead gme thru a 40 price right now might be justified if you believe the people behind chewy will run gme well in the meantime gaming isn’t going anywhere and the bigs like amazon haven’t captured this market well but gme will plus as a huge number of shorts begin to cover their positions this is going to  and crush the shorts
relax longs 40 plus at closing and a gapper in the am shorts are toasts
big money week for all stocks
gme is the leader in the bricksandmortar retail game sales sector which is in longterm decline but temporarily boosted by launching of microsoft xbox and sonys play station game consoles gme has been vastly under investing in the online gaming area because it diverted its investments into mobile phone retail and service businesses and thus wasted a lot of capital hrb is the leader in the brickandmortar income tax preparation business which also face longterm decline and hrb is the second largest online tax preparation and tax software player behind turbotax and has been investing in this growth area for more than two decades and aggressively so in the last 5 years thus hrb has had and will continue to have a better future whats more hrb blocks short ratio is 548 while that of gme is at 578 hrb might be the next one to be squeezed because this tax season will be strong for hrb
so who is the massive short position
bear haha cant believe you bought at 47actually means pls panic sell before we reach new highs
you can see from the price trend that this stock is crashing it goes up and then down more all the big guys are out
or the 1030 power breakfast and as cramer and faberer said shorts cannot cover this is going to run i actually received a call from a friends son in his 20s and he said he bought stock friday this is going rampid i want to see a close over 100 today how about you
just like the past citron live stock goes up after his live but hell lotsa call before that for big short squeeze
i bought 1 share at 4295 the other day my penny slot machine i paying off well here so far i might even hold the share past settlement date

now the investors who took the shorts to the cleaners in gme can now afford tsla and will buy a ton of tsla to take the shorts to the cleaners again thumbs up if that is you
what time is citron conference call
patienceand you will be rewarded handsomely
okjust so you knowthe professional shorts dont read this board and they dont care what small traders with what fractional robinhood shares say or do
well good morning to you too

when cohen change gme from retailer to tech 100 a share will be low price for that company with this massive revenue numbers
i am loving watching this but i have to say this could be the sign we have been waiting for that the bubble is about to burst this rise has been meteoric but the drop is going to be equally as fast enjoy the ride set your trailing stopsand enjoy your lambos

buy the dip nowwwwww
sec manipulating the market
just got confirmed game stop staring to make ev vehicles stock is flying 
nobody said it would be easy lads
citron may be right that it is overvalued but it doesnt matter as of 1231 there was 144 short interestmeaning their are more shares short than actually exist whoever is short is running the risk that this stock can have an infinity squeeze take a look at what happened to volkswagen no doubt citron is also short and will either cover when the stock collapses or be forced to cover during an explosion up as happened with volkswagen for those of you unfamiliar with what happened in volkswagen here is the link volkswagen infinity squeezehttpsmoxreportscomvwinfinitysqueeze
wake up babe rc tweeted
for anyone that is considering to sell their position or have already sold the position remember this comment when were at 5060 range by end of week short squeeze is imminent nothing they can do i put 15k in today and ready to put another 15k if this dips lower than my entry as many have already pointed out this is a historic event in the making
12082020 thru 12212020 ten 10 business days excl today’s info which isn’t avail yet gme is on the threshold securities list httpswwwnysecomregulationthresholdsecurities with code “ y “ repeat gme is listed with a “ y “ code httpwwwnasdaqtradercomtraderaspxidregshodefs “ subject to the requirements of sec rule 203 of regulation sho where there is an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency totaling 10000 shares or more and equal to at least 05 of the issuer’s total shares outstanding when this occurs the security becomes subject to mandatory closeout requirements outlined in the secs regulation shothe allowed values are y  yes if the issue is subject to mandatory closeout requirements of regulation sho n  no if the issue is not subject to mandatory closeout requirements of regulation sho “httpswwwsecgovinvestorpubsregshohtm lots of reading but the following is interesting given the above  of days gme has actively been on the threshold securities list “… rule 204 – closeout requirement…” “…in addition rule 203b3 of regulation sho requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver referred to as “threshold securities” if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days…”looks like dec 24th a short trading day is potentially the 13th day if longs hold for a few more days then christmas might be particularly merry especially the following week remember nyse is closed dec 25th
bum here there is a blind spot we cant see if gme does issue more shares from shelf offering thats a big problem this thing would correct really hard if gme does issues that shelf offering a troubling thought prepare to baghold in 30s and 40s for a very very very long time no wonder the 20 puts for next week have value i prolly shouldnt have sold them given that possibility dey say follow the short squeeze and buy like crazy but its a real pain in the  to be long at 40s and 50s and find the dump back to the 20s or 10s right before you know it that would be like locked into a prison no escape whew
amtx is the play guys this is over
anthony chukumba on cnbc starting the dis information campaign on cnbc right now 1138am est
this tells us one thing shorts are scared trying to manipulate gme stock past two weeks
halt 5 coming
the manipulation today is crazy
i keep seeing posts on this should be nowhere near the all time high gamestop bought back millions of shares over the years at the height they were worth 10 billion when they hit 60 in order for this to hit the high again it would be 180 due to the amount of shares outstanding now compared to the 2007 and 2011 runs i want to see the squeeze of the century and be involved just keep shorting away
this seems reasonable
if yall havent read this already or if you are out of the loop on what a historical shortsqueeze scenario gme is in please read this and share with other holders of gmehttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentskwb827gmeendgamedtcinfinity

have seen this type of action before with a small solar company piggybacking on tesla news year ago went from 2 to over 9 in 48 hrs within the next 24 hrs it dropped below 2 and was delisted 2 years later after multiple reverse splitsjust something to keep in mind when trading the next few days
to the people in fear that the company is going to massively dilute their stock its not going to be as detrimental as you believe its 100 million dollars worth of shares when they see fit if the price per share is near 100 or over it will only be about 1mil shares or less dilution over all would be negligible

newbie question please be real so when the millions of shorts attempt to cover before the end of the day the price will rocket up
options prices show market bullish on gme for tomorrow
too the mooon  too bad the moon can be south of you depending on where you are hahaa
bears havent been right about gme since 2015
i like how the shorts try to say dont buy they always go down there are but not in this case it a phenomenon that becomes a living monster like tsla and wayfair to name a few humans cant help themselves and when the fire gets lit its all over for the shorts like the others i mentioned they just keep going up it wont stop
second wave on the way hold the line buy more this will hit 100
next support should hold around 4041 after the next left up
i wanted to add from a previous post after checking the stats on the calls options at the different strikes i know at least one institution definitely was margin called today then going back and forth with some other people they really believe that the shares short really didnt decrease much and this was more of a gamma squeeze due to the itm options on the 60 strike it has to be a combination of the two but the short  of the float should still be above 120125 this is going to go so much higher over the next two weeks and until 50 million shares are covered and these retail people stop naked shorting it wont stop to think there must be another 1520 funds loaded to the hilt with short shares and next week is going to be wild cant stop wont stop gamestop
had this stock at 470 wish i kept it

fubo scenario on monday
where do folks get the idea that a squeeze occurs in a single day the system just diesnt work like that there is no pressure relief valve this will play out between buyers and sellers over months or the price would go to 50000 and buyers  holders out number sellers close to 4 to 1 the system will throttle this over months but the gain will be 4 digit percentage points to the upside
too many weak hands in here if you don’t have any conviction that this short squeeze will explode up you should get out now let us patient longs make crazy profits it’s basic mathematics too many stock shorts and not enough float what is there to doubt and argue about i’m holding long until triple digits
short at 38
the system is in control the physics of a true short squeeze cannot be denied sell or buy does not matter because it will rise steadily until volume dries up and shorts have covered down to a realistic short interest
buy keep buying eod 100
its only a matter of time
wonder if criminal left exited all positions
i was wondering all with respect to the possible shortsqueeze does it make a difference whether you have stocks in nys or frankfurt europe i know normally all the stocks are aligned but in this case i wonder what the outcome is in europe which is open on monday if there is a shortsqueeze that seems to be a very locally nys development sorry if i babble im not very experienced

i mean 4 digits to the price of this stock is like a dream i doubt it  maybe in like long term but if the squeeze will last till like april and the price will be in the thousands or close to that then i will be walking with a hard on for months

this will probably test 50 around 2pm today a lot of shorts will rush to cover before the weekend and of all the stocks to short this is probably the most dangerous of all to a hedge fund short as it gains 35 every day most professional short sellers wont want to hold this over the weekend they prefer to short stocks with low volume and is not talked about much when all the barrons articles and wsj articles start appearing about the highest gaining stock of the week gme over the weekend monday will see a huge push
do not sell it can go way higher
buy at the dip
this will go down as fast as it went up all longs are above water now when it starts to tank they will sell to save their profits or what’s left of them best thing to do is sell ore market monday it will bounce up a tad might even close up a little monday then the blood bath starts get out and take your profits now go to the next one this pig won’t last

maybe plug sees some of that gme gamestop action amazing how they are getting after the shorts aka tslaplug is the architect of hydrogen revolution viva la plug
we will prevail against citron they have manipulated the market for too long hold your position and show them you understand short interest better than them
its still up almoat 40 today whats with all these fake people saying its dead 
halted for a second time this morning 75 million shares in first 90 minutes could dwarf fridays 200 million
longs who got suckered into buying by the other greedy pumpers who didnt take profits after the stock double in 2 days be like
godspeed gamechanger
love it
this is not good i bought at peak and now im down 400k that was my wifes entire lifes savings
two things you should always do when investing 1 buy on red days 2 whatever andrew left and his deceased ex wife say do the exact opposite
these idiots keep bashing the physical to digital transformation and the death of gmes future do they not think cohen is that stupid to invest millions to go down the drain there is something brewing for sure what that is the 64 million dollar question and when again not a matter of if but when i also dont think msft would have any interest in partnering with a dying company jmho
game bros im buying more shares
let’s not forget the fourth quarter sales numbers are out later today
new pt is 1000paper hands all you want but not under 500 you have people to take good care of
margin call short squeezing
my avg short position is 4192 i started at 44 and have added down as low as 3970 feeling good as it will not close above 40 there is no positive reviews on gme supporting the move nor any excitement from institutions to recommend above 18 and the latest target is 5 earnings only drop each year down 29 the last 5 years other then joining a squeeze the risk is to the downside social media longs are being lead astray and the leaders will be out well before the last of the sheep jump in this may just turn into a long trap we shall see
4k shares left availabe to short lmao if this gets any volume it over for them buy the stock ruin their holidays thats what they deserve for manipulating market
great news about short interest seems like shorts are pushing it down buying back and then reshortingall the time making the mountain higher and the fall even harder
halted reached 150 and then 13232 and stopped
bidask at 149
this goes up up up today
bears here celebrating that they are only down 38 instead of 60 lolstill massive shorts to squeeze more stop losses to hit
clvs is next short cover 40 short
pretty crazy how this is being held down by citron
i dont own any shares but if i were gme i would do an offering asapit will create growth for future
this is very very intense
halted at 69 again
this dude cannot even stream and he is gonna give people advise about the tech sector and gaming what a joke
it should keep going up 12 percent per day until its worth more than aapl and tsla
where is my 150 sp but reallyi got used to 50 green days
ok this is for all the people that are new to trading with this much of an price increase it seems like a good thing to buy this stock however don’t do it unless you can say trade it
am i too late to the party if i buy monday
short rules will change because of this
sold 1500  1550 due to calls assignment received 1200 premium for 15 calls still have 4500 sh under 10 price and 40 calls for 1650 strike expired worthless and put 2200 premium in pocket will write on monday 40 17 strike calls for 1224 expiration for around 040 this is becoming a gold mine in call premiumsjust saying
a fundamental problem with short selling is the potential for unlimited losses
holding
this is still mooning just loaded more shares 30  3933

reddit and robinhood warriors please crush clvs next 40 short on a cancer stock thank you and best regards z

time for gme to pay off their massive debt with robin hood money
blockbuster 20 lol
circuit breaker tripped will restart soon
i understand cohen got a big stake what’s the turnaround plan regarding physical stores
should gme stay above 60 an infinite gamma squeeze will be triggered by a flaw in market structure and an error in market hedging by market makers if retail investors hold onto their shares and buy calls above the 60 strike price otm this infinite gamma squeeze will take place most likely triggering a short squeeze tldrhold onto your shares longs this fight is not over and 60 is our maginot line we can easily stay above that
when are we selling 100 this stock going 200
hold it
negative net income ttm 270 million 445 millon in cash at this cash burn rate they need a miracle to avoid bk in two years

go go go wsb army
in the short term this game is fun but when there is a profit wont most people will think of themselves first does some imaginary person on the internet really care about you or are they sucking in people so they can sell at a higher profit leaving the last buyers holding the bag
aaaaaand were green
the frankfurt market placed a closing price of gme at 3440 1586 currency in eur which would give early us trading an opening price of 4155
one thing that hasn’t been discussed is possibility gme management makes a large stock offering and kills this momentum nndm just did this again as there seems to be no shortage of capital around
some people just do not know what cohen will do for this company he will double sales
i should give gme management and this sector some credit despite my negative view and refusal to invest in this company called gamestop after all cruise line companies such as rcl ccl nclh are the real victims of this pandemics because they have far worse economics and far more significant losses in revenues than gme is at this point but yet the cruise line stocks were performing better and recovered a lot earlier than gme until november 4 2020 when things started to change for gme for the better
these high share prices are what we can expect to see and more but in the near future the balance sheets dont hold up quite yet
after being down 5 this is up almost 7 or18  in the premkt at 42 what a movejust saying
the short interest in amc is very similar to gmewas 2 a few days ago n now 355 n climbinghopefully we have a squeeze just like gme good luck longs

congrats to the long  i found out about the jump and sold out at 42 just a couple days earlier but still happy for everyone have been holding it for over 2 years and thinking that it is a long term loss so glad to see it back to life
andrew left from citron  piece of crapola his gig is not working any more he tried it on pltr recently i am so glad people dont fall for it any morehe likes to do it in the middle of the trading day what a total bag of you know what the millennials are sharp the shorts are all over bitcoin also that is not working out either i am actually proud of all you longs i am thinking about buying on monday i hope andrew has a nice margin call thanks guys humanity is alive and well

this thing looks very shaky the wsb gods are telling the longs to hold but if you bought below 90 take your profit
shorts will try to keep it under 20
i see it not stopping under 200
retail shorts i beg you jump out now
next stop 40
the shorts will eventually need to cover and the shares are gonna dry up
tell me we have 120 million shares so far traded today and there are only 70 million shares outstanding how does this happen considering guys like me are not trading
gevo is going up thats the next wave
it’s consolidating right now and getting ready for another run up before the close of market today i’m holding long still and will be patiently waiting for the huge pop towards triple digits the weak hands sold but the strong ones are still long with gme shorts better cover now while you still can
um thanks for the discount
bubble is busting now book loss and save tax by the end of the year by reducing capital gain

another day another gain shorts still havent been margin called in high numbers
gme outpaces growth in china vs tsla sales by a 2 to 1 margin
this ain’t even the squeeze yet right 
wsb represent tendies  wants your entry point
watch out for latest news “millions committed suicide for shorting gme”
they shorted poor gamestop for two years and sank it so low why do they destroy iconic businessesi would miss gamestop at the mall and im an old man now bleed out wiseguys
gme is insane never see a stock moving like except wnw i miss this  at 4
longs keep in mind that we are here until this thing shoots way way up don’t settle for peanuts at 50 hold your positions and buy more if you can we own the shorts
great note before to end the call they are going to share the q4 revenues results early in january dont have to wait other 3 months to see that thats definitely a move to show their progress and great numbers are coming along with the mentioned profitability debt reduction and massive online revenues growth 200 shorts have a very short life better prepare

httpstwittercomjslamatstatus1341804489561440257 jon najarian bought calls explains the jump
why on earth is this going up all they do is sell games how does this equate to a 130 stock price
ahhhh profit tomorrow 
wow been watching since 20 never jumped in as i thought it would correct itself first that never happened lol i def can’t jump in at these prices way too expensive
im shaking just looking at the price and my account
from barronsbusiness continues to get worse for gamestop this past week the videogame retailer said that its holiday sales were down 31 and the company continues to withhold earnings guidance due to the “evolving impact of covid19”it’s no matter gamestop ticker gme shares rose a stunning 101 on the week one week ago we argued that the stock looked pricey at about 18 and now it’s nearly 36 the timing of our bearish call was terrible but our view remains the same
moass phase 1 beginsi warned shorts at 16 well good luck i guess
the big short 2 the sequel
peixexploding
next week is the reckoning its inevitable
im sure the battle of the post shorts against the longsall the rideric was occurring when wayfair exploded from 18 to 300 overnight when we reach 150 come earnings in march i may peel off some profit but until then ill sit back and laugh
short squeeze just started observe the beginning of short squeeze charts minor 10 dips happens and are followed by 20  gains the following trading days all the shorts telling you to sell is manipulating you you can either win the lottery here or watch the  walk away with your potential gains
230 by end of the day i hear shorts calling for margin calls buy them back
dont be surprised when there is a direct offering if you dont think that then you need to take a look at their debt ratio if they ever want to survivie they need to direct offer to pay off debt and get new mergers this will hit them in the short run but be better in the long run if they do choose to direct offer expect this to go to 20 then rally back up if there is no offering then this stock is going to hell with blockbuster
someone letting the shorts off the hook
next wave on the way
imagine being short sub 20 dollars on gme hahahaha or being timmy that is short sub 5 dollars ouchie
gonna be a lot of surprises tomorrow
wow im not even joking anymorethis chart analysis is setting up for the perfect cup and handle bullish patternit started on oct 14 roughly and now around nov 30exactly 7 weeksit is selling off on light volume right now to form the handlethen the pop
just check the insider trades on january 14th 25 of the volume was sold by insiders best pump and dump of the decade right here
same time tomorrow boys
this will take several days to top out
looks like 34 was the bottom for today 40 eod easily shorts go back to china
wow this is battle  trading punches shorts v longs
holy sht do not sell lets aim for 60
i was in early so i only sold a small part to get the original investment back and a bit more the biggest chunck ill be holding as long as is needed to force that squeeze no risk involved 
calling for the ones who know what they are talking about herehow do we actually know the squeeze hasnt happened yet  if shorts had to cover by this morning then that supposed squeeze is behind usa reliable source would be appreciated

oh look i just bought 2 more games through ps store and subbed ps plus for one year for 5999 lol
make no mistake about it cohen wants shorts to burrrrrn he was denied financing over 100 times for his chewy idea because of doubters
please cover if you are a short fight another day stocks dont just go up but today you dont have the wheel
get ready for takeoff 
tulips tulips for sale
i dont know about you but im selling all shares monday and putting it in gme easiest money ill ever make in my life and im not gonna miss it
there is a reason if you check any of these bears profiles they are all in 810 a year stocks and they think thats all anyone deserves bc they dont have the brains to investigate for higher all my recent stocks are 50150 plus from the time i first comment on my profile with everything with more time being 200500 youll also notice i sell when the time is right it isnt now
sell now
you know it is funny watching gme share prices go up the last 5 months the shorts that hit gme below 6 dollars are watching the shorts that have been on the higher ranges short and keep running the price up further and further while longs have been buying up the shares if i was short and deep in the red watching other shorts run the price up i would be so  off
citron should learn not to mess with robinhooders
im so lonely and now im broke
lets gooo
mr cohen is interested now just a matter of time
here’s why this will be the biggest squeeze on record still over 100 interest we have people trying to flip their hold positions into short positions and then a quick panic back to hold natural psychology is making people intuitively want to short now but it’s actually feeding the squeeze process even more short interest isn’t going down
i love when the scammers get scammed lolololllooo
22 of shares traded today were shorts and yet we held the price pretty good diamond hands buying more every day
margin calls coming in like
did it get halted again are they just going to keep halting it whenever it goes down ha
bulls if your ever losing just flip the screen upside down
team diamond hands or paper hands
imagin the upside rally when the market open and shorters need to cover hahahahah
something is gotta give either up or down
we need more shorts to fry
halted 4 minutes after open lol
gme is a steal at this price  a gaming leader needs to be established  gme at 100 by next week  dont miss the train this time 
now thats out of the way enjoy your margin calls shorts
to all the people asking if you should buy or sell look no one knows the future here and everyone spouting numbers is full of it if you have a few grand only go with what you can afford that also allows you to sleep at night if you do buy you need to hold on tight because this will be a rollercoaster of epic proportions in my 32 years i have never seen such a perfect storm brewing here is my bull list1 cohen taking over will transform this into a digital powerhouse thin steam with pc xbox ps5 and switch games online with a platform and codes 2 on retail some stores will close but the ones that are performing will be altered to include almost lie a build your own pc3 4 old board members are out and three new ones are in including cohen so its not the same management 4 short percentage is 140 of the float highest in the history of wall street and even 3 millions shares short more than total shares outstanding 5 gamma squeeze with all the itm calls could make this one of the most volatile stocks in the history creating the perfect storm6 they have cash 440 million and are not going bk anytime soon and their debt is low interest bear case1 bric and mortar are dead2 old management has no vision 3 stock price is to high to justify but they dont talk about all the shares bought back cutting the shares outstanding to a third of what it was since 2008 if you buy dont get scared and again only go in with what you can afford to lose
500 million shares are short that’s insane
their resistance is getting weaker as we go higherthe only stock thats better as it gets expensive crazy to play this technical game huh
halted again hahahahaha
halted again hahahaha
amazon is buying gme and another undisclosed games developer in q1 2021
let me get this straight gme lost 600m in 2019 lost money in 2020 to be expected and hasnt seen a 42 stock price in over 6 years and we are expecting this thing to keep going dont get me wrong i wont get caught in the short squeeze up but you can guarantee i will be riding this thing back down to the 20 price range tops where this thing belongs
party hard baby
the borrow rate helps speed up their exit
is too late to jump in 
all shorts will cover tomorrow as no more bad news are published on gamestop see the biggest squeeze in history  2500 here we come
citron really had to respond to the biggest bull case if he wanted his video to do anything ryan cohen gaining control of the boardbut he didnt
55 next dip
theyll run out of shares to short and well blow up
manipulations are now out of control place your losing bet today
no when to hold them no when to fold them its been a fun ride the majority of the wsb crowd will be equally depressed as they are elated when they listened to a guy from behind a computer screen who was dumping his shares
vw style 
was hoping the drop would be a bit more so i could get more cheap shares but it didnt so i grabbed another 5k shares at 1346 puts my total shares up to 8300 you all need to read more than the  the shorts put on this page gme never gives and early er preview which they said will happen in january that should be indication enough that they are impressed with the current numbers to want everyone to know early they still have the rest of this month to sell more to hahaha as i go to the bank with the shorts money next month
 wow short fell the pain
trading halted
told yall still a bargin70 bucks today and tommorow will be bettersshorts need to cover its public info
anyone else is frozen
is today the day
this action shows you how teslas been doing it all these years
just got in it still going
it astounds me that some of you seem to think all of this is wsb reddit you think wsb bought 17 million shares today what about the volume yesterday the day before this is big money this is institutions if you think this is just wsb you dont understand anything about the stock market at all ridiculous
time is on the long’s side every day this stays in the 40s means more interest due on the borrowed shares and more margin calls unsustainable for more than a week or two for the shorts patience will be rewarded
arent stocks funny
take the loss now shorts or you will truly get slaughtered
gme is a long term play as well don’t forget
im in this is the way
by the end of today 250 million shares will have traded in the last two days any idea how to tell how many shorts covered
shorts gunna wanna cover before the weekend news could comet
when i sell at 90 instead of 150 and can only afford a huracan instead of an aventador
news before the opening that will get the price rockets 
the best thing citron can do is to do a livestream that way some long will recognized him and be able to shake his hand
time to sell  morning margin calls being forced right now sell into the rally after this bubble pops
open nice bottle of wine and keep enjoying
i have no idea why i cant stay away from this board on a saturday i think the story is just compelling and it draws me in i post here and there but the shorts just dont understand how much trouble they are really in here not only is the entire float short but the big funds are so stuck in here short and not sure where to begin 5060 million shares need to be covered before this can stop going up this will be a short squeeze of our lifetime and i have no idea when it will stop when they issue new strikes on the calls monday 70s 80s 100s you are going to see something that you wouldnt think is possible these shorts are just going to be stuck in this loop going up and up with new ones jumping on board screaming the value the deck at this point is so stacked against their position it is incredible the possibility of this going down with 140 of the float short position is so small the odds are so minimal maybe they get a down draft but like a spring they are just coiling it back up again it will be interesting to see if we get a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze at the same time for all the shorts or bots that have joined this board and trying to  people to sell the desperation is really showing and all the longs have to do at this point is just hold do you know how many big funds see this now and can smell the blood in the water all these short funds are just sitting ducks at this point as they used to be the shark in the water if you ever thought it was a good idea to short a stock with the highest ever short percentage or even more shares short shares than are outstanding you will be taught a valuable lesson in market mechanics soon on to valuation and metrics with this closing at 453 billion market cap this still only represents at 72 ps where normal businesses right now have a average of 25 even if you go off that 25 number it gives you a market cap of 156 billion or more than a triple from here share price of 180200 this is due to when the stock got to 64 back in 2008 they also had 210 million shares outstanding today that number stands at less than 70 million so to even get back to the all time high this will need to be at 180 plusnext lets take a quick look at the turn around they want to move to a digital platform offering multiple games through pc xbox ps5 ect steam only offers pc and their prices are high for a lot of games epic only offers pc and they dont have a great selection gamestop now get residual from microsoft and they can really get in the game here with the brick and mortar they will close the under performers and will move onto a more collectible and build your own pc type model cohen is going to find the niche in this market and perform so well
volume is key fails to deliver are going to set a new record that cant and wont be ignored expect investigations and law suits shorts and market makers are in huge bind
wsb attack buy the dip
not sure about eveyone else but i sold at 73 bucks 10k shares not a bad gain for 5 months wait now i wait for the pull back to mid 40s god willing and ride the long front into the future with ryan oh and who was it that said i was a poster child for poor trading choices when i added 2700 more shares hahaha moron
be realistic and buy yourself some puts
bear trap they just shorted the last available shares from 850k down to 100k keep shorting it just adds more fuel to the fire ladies
how do you have 260 short the float
they are doing what tesla did whether they shorted 100 85 or 70 of the outstanding shares the shorts are in a heap of trouble
by late late friday we will get a signal of what earnings will look like for q3 the whisper may tell us that they are either good no significant surpries or bad the stock will move accordingly however if they are a positive surprise and during the call next week they offer some updates on the new box sales activity with some guidance and clarity of the expectations from the microsoft deal regarding expected revenue this stock can move significantly higher my guess is that the shorts are very concerned at this point and we may sell upward movement tomorrow i would love to see a little blurb of positive news today or early tomorrow if so shorts will be  their pants over the weekend imho
this bull run was supposed to been happened if it wasn’t for citron one catalyst and game over
passing all time highs next week 
i just placed a limit sell order of 1000 shares for 42069 come and get it shorts
make sure you all join that citron event spam the chat with  and nuts andrew left literally pays his wifes bf 50kmonth  puts on andrew sex life
1929 this type of gambling will cause a crash and recession the fed will have caused the greatest economic collapse ever

holdd and keep buying
15 incoming
shorts are terrified
holdsee ya on tuesday
another halt for gme hahahahaha
the little gaming engine company who could
42 is shorts final stand
here is a q what happens to the shorts if there buy out lets say at 40bucks but woundnt they have cover at what ever price 60 100in other words i think that even with a 40 dollar buy out the price would end up going much higher shorts are very much introuble
however with the stake in gamestop now grown to over 9 million shares for a 129 position rc ventures says it will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholderssome analysts though scoff at the notion the video game retailer can become a force in online gaming with benchmark analysts calling it comical to believe gamestop could effectively compete against amazon
if this falls from these levels then shareholders should file lawsuits for not doing a share offering not doing a share offering will cause major damages
buy it all
halt again 3rd today
wall st and their games
buy it up
just another day in the most manipulated stock of all time

when does the gme trade get worn out and people move on to other shorts primed to pop like amcx with 93 of the float short
a moment of silence for the 
guys i am about to get a heart attack as i bought at 72 will it go up again
gamestop reached an all time high at 9680
i wonder what the price would be on this stock if the company was actually profitable
yea lets see you try to squeeze a real lemon like sorrento srne great rumors and perfect for a squeeze to 30 but i short the fker even more if you do
what people here dont grasp is this whether they are bearish or bullish on gme shares short vs outstanding the number of shares shorted is astounding and the bears only have themselves to blame for this two years of shorting gme lead to this eventually more people are going to get interested especially with the likes of cohen most who invested in chewy saw its success and are now eyeing gme long term meaning they are buying and not letting go the shorts have been steadily getting burned since his announcement of buying 9 percent of the shares available on the market he holds no institutional shares so yes he holds 20 percent of all available traded shares not shorted its why the price has risen incrementally now the shorts are trapped its going to be interesting to all the longs profit at the top or near to the shorts catch it as the bubble breaks and that you dont suffer massive losses i am long on this company i want to see what plans are in the works i have been loyal to this company since it was babbages bought in september for the console cycle was going to sell in dec but then cohen
you shorts are desperate af and meanwhile all whilst pretending you have no putsthis isn’t a audition
i dont think what cramer the  is doing is ethical at all asking people to buy heavily shorted stocks what if his listeners are left holding the bag in worthless investments sec should look into his recent practices meanwhile i will day trade the crrrp out of these and make some dough but will never hold one overnight bbby skt bynd

when people talk about short squeezes and they mntion vw the stock you really need to look at is tlry a week after they ipod shorts went in 50 of the float stock went to 20 to 300 when the squeeze happened in 2003 and 2004 room and expe before they went private under barry diller were at 5060 and went from 20 to 200 telsa from 180 to this just monster run right now jcom at one point had 65 short interest and went from 5 to 60 i cant ever remember a stock that was at 140 short interest of float or where there were more shares short then even outstanding

the short squeeze didnt even begin
sorry needs to squeeze harder
expect huge changes to gamestop membership program cohen will incentivize the heck out of it what if the pro rewards elite program offered a free pre owned game each month just for being a member or when you trade a game in get store credit and a pre owned game of equal value thus limiting over head and introducing more foot traffic drastic changes must be made to maintain viability why do people buy subscriptions the incentives outweigh the cost currently sony and ms have subscriptions that offer online play and free games each month however if you decide for monetary reasons or other wise to let your subscription lapse you will lose access to all your games with a gme rewards system similar you would actually own the game regardless if the subscription runs out same free game model could be extended to online digital codes which in the end means you own it and its not tied to a pay wall
haha  this is absurd i’d call this a bubble but i think bubble is to subtle a termthis is something entirely new insanity

cslt shares have been moving up a lot lately either someone knows something good is about to happen or cslt is getting caught up in this gme mania
a close above 40 today signals the beautiful week we will have would it be a possible small dividend announcement that would send this soaring keep in mind that benefits only long holders forcing shorts to cough up more money hmmm they have cash and they knowingly have positive cash flow it may be a crazy idea but stranger things have happened
sales at us retailers fell in december for the third month in a row as the record deluge of coronavirus cases opened fresh wounds in the economyretail sales dropped 07  last month the government said friday economists polled by dow jones and the wall street journal had forecast a 01 declinewhat happened sales fell sharply at internet retailers bars and restaurants and electronic stores accounting for most of the decline last monthinternet retailers posted a surprising 58 plunge in sales they’ve been one of the standout performers during the pandemic sales are still up 19 from a year earlier howeverbars and restaurants also suffered a 45 drop in sales marking the third decline in a row they are among the businesses that bore the brunt of new government restrictions after the resurgence in coronavirus cases late last year customers were also more wary of going out for fear of catching the virussales also slid nearly 5 at bigbox stores such as best buy bby 011 that sell appliances and electronics receipts dipped 17 at grocers as wellthose declines more than offset a nearly 2 increase in sales at auto dealerssales also increased 66 at gas stations mostly due to higher prices but higher energy prices don’t help consumers or the economy

no one in their right mind would buy over 9 million shares of a company and then volunteer to fix said company unless they have a pretty solid plan its crazy to me that so many bears fail to realize this
the shorts have to cover theyve dug themselves a massive hole
i said it yesterday but ill say it again i love you gme
everyone trying to scare people rn this is still up 26 since when we left this conversation on friday after close
wake up shorty time for that margin call 
why should i buy this absurd low valuation trading lower than their revenue cohen will take over and focus on ecommerce thus higher profit margins valued as brick and mortar stock but ecommerce stocks get pe of 30 easy ps of at least 100 with a ps of 1 this stock will be at 90
next week citron will short amazon and walmart hahahahaha
gme is nearing six billion is annual sales and new management is in place to assist with the digital market short interest is higher than the number of shares outstanding this is an unusual situation that likely will drive the share price much higher
do you now what has really bothered me since the new short numbers came out how are we short 3 million shares over what is issued in the stock how is this even possible  i have been racing my brain trying to figure out how they created a synthetic short position of shares that dont exist to push the price downthey must have a network of accounts set up and buy and sell to each other through these accounts when the shares are being recalled every 3 days they just trade with each other moving this synthetic short over and over however wouldnt they have to pay the current borrow rate each time  the borrow rate right now is just insane how many shares are doing this 
this will easily recover to 4243 range by monday just calm down and hold
i dont own this stock but i am rooting for the bulls citron is a total fraud and a scam take away citrons twittersocial media and he wouldnt make any moneythey are terrible stock pickers
shorts are delusional we all make bad trades once in a while gme shorts however are trying to convince themselves that theyre on the winning side of this your 30 borrowing fees will send you straight to the welfare office before you ever see a profit smarten up and cover
buy and hold 20 easy money
halts are good lets go everyone wants in
wow shorts got slaughtered good to see
if you remember or research what happened during the short squeeze of vw and compare it to this youll find it is similar but very different porsche was pretty much the sole driver behind the squeeze on vw and really had a limited amount of money this squeeze is being driven by general shareholders those guys also have a communication platform and are recruiting new people that have never traded a single stock their first trade will be gme another difference is the percentage of short shares vw was only 12 gme has more shares shorted than what is available with all the attention and new people getting in this think is going to move fast when the shorts expire and need to cover these a “bunch of redditors with asperger’s have collaborated to engineer the short squeeze of the decade by buying shortdated outofthemoney call options” will be millionaires
i have 5 50 calls expiring in 3 days is this good or is this wack
indications this is headed to 3950 in the next hour
the longs are gloating which tells me the rally is over
brokers are trying to chase down shares to borrow fidelity is sending out emails beseeching people to allow fidelity to borrow shares i just received one of those emails dont loan them out the brokers will play them against you
how long are the halts usually
theres a good chance that gme will go up after the conference call not because the q3 numbers are great but a positive q4 and 2021 outlook any significant upside surprise could trigger a short squeeze
i need it to go to 37 so i can buy 100 more shares  short it shorts
highly shorted stock this can ramp at the end of day and when all the short got margin call it will fly another 20 percent
sp is coming back strong now  3937
i’m buying more and holding long it has a lot of room to get up triple digits in the near future we are in control of this squeeze a lot of upside with minimal downside
that was the baby squeezezz before the moass
just wow
im really shocked how the price keeps going up im actually scared to short this now
23 today
what funny is no one is buying this because they actually think game stop is worth anything near these prices
i honestly just love seeing shorts die lol
i had 1000 shares long on wed and got scared about the left video being released on thu should have held i had no idea that wsb readers could move a stock in this way and i did not have enough of a cushion to see what happened on fri i did learn a few things and think that while this stock is ahead of itself it may have great potential overall revenue is strong gaming is a growth industry i dont think the debt size is that unmanageable not sure why people are making a big deal about it they have lots of cash per share to have flexibility its a great brand people may not go to the stores but they all know the name the business can be transitioned quite easily to online and the stores could serve as gaming recreation areas since mall vacancy rates are quite high and rents will be low they would need to close some stores and perhaps expand or buy vacant movie theaters for creating gaming areas similar to arenasthat said there must be a reason that all the analysts think this is a 20 stock tops at this time and that includes the addition of mr cohen to the board turnarounds take time and it wont happen overnight in the meantime amzn and msft will be looking for share as well as companies we may not even know about yet new ones japanese chinese the short interest will continue to make this a volatile pick and the price may go up to irrational heights thats how the market works sometimes it may be a good time to do a secondary offering and get rid of the debt but interest rates are low and so keeping the float could make it easierand after my having lost money on many of mr lefts predictions i think it might be time for him to find another line of work he gets it wrong more often than he gets it right and im surprised that he has any cache on the street at all i think he is done at this point and if he did have a large short position may very well be out of business looking forward to what this week will bring should be fun wish i had kept my shares
this past week was certainly fun if you were long i found it comical that citron’s andy left tried to explain 5 reasons for shorting to 20 and subsequently was run over by longs buying akin to kevin bacon being flattened by the onrush crowd in “animal house” here are my 5 reasons why gme is still a buynew game console cycle – both microsoft and sony launched their new generation consoles in november 2020 something that happens every 57 years both consoles feature disk drive versions that are backwards compatible both positives for gme the new console cycle will help drive profitability at gme as it has done in prior cycles fy20 will be the trough of the earnings cycle and revenue and earnings in fy21 should rise to 677b in revenue with ebitda of 333m and eps of 270share according to hedgeye at a 65 share price shorts are saying it has matched similar peaks from the 2007 64 and 2013 58 cycles but the share count is substantially lower versus prior cycles with only 65m outstanding versus 158m and 117m respectively with fewer shares outstanding the share price peak is likely higher i would guess it will peak between 105155share excluding other factors i’ll discuss belowdebt reduction – the current ceo george sherman really emphasized debt reduction when he came into the company since he joined in march 2019 gme has taken aggressive actions to cut debt from 820m to the current 291m with current positive cash flows and net cash on the balance sheet the future debt maturities in 2021 73m and 2023 218m are well covered for repayment for those saying gme is blockbuster 20 and going bankrupt there is no comparison as blockbuster was a debt laden mess whereas gme has a debtebitda of 1 and is not going bk anytime soon sorry to rain on the shorts paradeecommerce – this is an area that has many on this board abuzz over ryan cohen joining the bod they see great hope that he can help gme transform faster into a dominate ecommerce player but gme’s ecommerce platform has done well in fy20 growing at a 309 yy rate achieving 135m in sales in the first 11 months many posters suggest that the gme is undervalued based on its exceptional ecommerce growth most fast growing ecommerce retailers are valued on ps ratios as they a not yet profitable here are some examples chewy 66x stitchfix 44x amazon 45x and ebay 34x at these valuation ranges gme’s ecommerce segment could be worth 78–152share but wait they have a profitable brick  mortar piece to add to the valuation if i give sales for this portion a lowly 02x valuation the total sum of the business is worth 94168share it is likely worth toward the higher valuation as gme’s ecommerce business is growing much faster than ebayshort interest – good news for the shorts many capitulated on friday the first day of the short squeeze when the stock rose 22 in a single session but there is still over 100 of the float short the stock as of the end of friday even though i show shares are still undervalued many buyers really do not bother about fundamentals at this point as buyers smell blood in the water due the extremely high short interest buy and keep buying is the manta so that more and more shorts get margin calls which in turn lifts the price higher i forecast more pain ahead for shorts this weekbuying tsunami – most of the rise in gme’s share price recently has been mainly due to buyers bidding up the stock ie wsb only on friday does it appear to have been short seller starting to cover shares in mass i believe this buying will continue nonstop until the shorts complete a mass exodus of their positions the final leg of the short squeeze one thing shorts should be aware of and fear is the huge stimulus the us government will initiate in february by sending out 1400 checks to individuals imagine 3 million wsb members getting 1400 to throw at the market all at one time that is 42b potentially going into the market at a few targeted shares frightening if you are short those targeted companies if they throw 1b at gme buying at 100share they would buy up 15 of the outstanding shares something to ponderas i said last weekend 35 was a great entry point for longs and good exit point for shorts the same still holds true at 65share as this stock is more than likely going into the triple digits
up only 68 disappointing lol
i’m not long or short on gme but come on you’re telling me a bankrupt company just made up 5 years of stock loss in a couple months this is 100 wsb autists puts are free cash rn

dont step on the tracks when the train is coming
price reflects no basis in reality just supply and demand in a very short time span a bet on a greater fool buying higher
buy shares and hold and set a gtc sell order for 1000 having that gtc sell order bans the institutions from borrowing it hold the line this is a tesla redux
bum here just a warning if gamestop needs people to order online to order consoles  bundles doesnt that mean they have no stock and delay the orders for their customers i saw on youtube that if employees were forced to deliver packages to fedex since fedex was backed up with the packages thats a big risk if that was the case then doesnt that mean upper management would try to fabricate their sales numbers forecasts to fake a holiday sales report oh whew that ones big no wonder why the iv so so massive for the options that expire on 115 put buyers aint jacking up premiums for nothing puts and calls both big gambling which bum here is
buy at 10 in a few months if you want to own a declining retailer

lol gme going against microsoft and others gme now pricing in 50 of market lol bwhaaaaa
i wonder if on q4 earnings we hear from cohen during q and a its time for him to start swinging his 99 percent share holder weight which to be honest is going to go higher he will own a majority soon and hopefully gut gamestop and rebuild this shouldnt have taken this long to realize how mismanaged this company currently is
gme talking about on cnbc right now
the reason behind this move is greedfor example russell 2000 went up 43 since novand the point is ladies and gents that greed for lack of a better word is good greed is right greed works greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit and we all know what the end will be

diamond handz
the number of shares available to short is going up and the fee is going down they are carefully covering but still 70 mil shares to cover haha
today 011221 the wsj reported that gmes short interest rose to 712 million shares as of 123020 or 45 from 121420 that represents 142 of the float as calculated by the wsj and more than 100 of the shares outstanding during those two weeks about 131 million shares changed hands as of yesterday gme has appeared on the threshold securities list for 23 consecutive days lastly over 10 million in the money puts will expire on friday good luck
no more shares left to short
puts are too expensive and impossible to short
dont panic if you see a dip the shorts will bomb the stock premarket volume is tiny for now but if they drive the price to the ground rule 201 will kick in again and tie their hands diamond hands everyone you will be rewarded gamestop is such a steal at these prices and if the shorts give us a discount buy more
buy more 10117 lol
do not sell need to see the short squeeze

gme to relive tesla short squeeze story
they trying to shake us out dont sell
can someone explain me how it’s possible total shares outstanding 6975 m but todays volume 1725 m how 
i am not buying or shorting but it is pretty fun to watch this stock as someday a ton of people who bought into this are going to get burned hard as i type the stock is 113 and you can only buy a call of a max 115 so it is almost there it would cost over 3600 to buy it also with a breakeven price of 152 a share that is insane
hello gamestop holders i know nothing about this stock but one thing i do know is that citron research releasing a report on you is a really bullish sign they know absolutely nothing and historically call everything wrong eg tesla nio nvidia shopify wayfair ect ect don’t let this short selling criminal manipulate and take your shares for a cheap price
this is epic short squeeze nothing else fair price 10 at best
bought some back on thursday and was losing hope by friday nice to see it rebound nothing more enjoyable than watching shorts get fried
and here we go again

i bought 90 shares at 1143  now i have 2800 usd on plus to bad i dint bought more and im happy i dint sell
lmao i might actually go buy something from gamestop maybe a funcopop a used controller hmm so many options with these gains
gaming going to streaming where does gamestop fit nowhere
folks take some profit and come back investment 101
we hit 40 again
it seems like most of the time when one sees a strong stock performance the day before an earnings report too often the stock sells off when the news is released this is often called sell the news however gme was down yesterday and is sluggish today with the earnings coming after the market closes odds are that it might do the opposite of sell the news i like the odds of it going up instead
hahahahahahahahaahhaaha
how margin calls work in volatile timesmany margin investors are familiar with the routine margin call where the broker asks for additional funds when the equity in the customer’s account declines below certain required levels normally the broker will allow from two to five days to meet the call
i repeat gme gang do not sell
ive been around since 14 every single time ive sold i ended up buying back in and watching it go even higher all i ended up doing was hurting my gains and hurting the people i love by letting my shares go to greedy shorts believe my sons until we meet in valhalla

tbh i doubt the retail investors are the main money behind this weve just been the most vocal and perhaps brought some attention to thisno way a bunch of wendys paychecks is winning vs hedgefunds theres big money behind this
just halted again
42 is where they are killing themselves to keep it below its sad
how much can we keep going up i want to buy more but i’m hesitant that right when i buy it will tank lol
also in case u guys dont know  the hedge fund citron cited in his video over pt tweeted back at him saying that 100 target is possible with cohen in the pic now
so much for a 3rd day of squeeze glad my put order filled at the jump up
short funds are hedged gme market cap is tiny at 1000 80b now if apple went from 2t to 20t on a squeeze financial instability
this is trading all over the board today i think it indicates some large short positions are trying to cover i agree with forklift man it would be nice to see this over 20 at the close we need to see new highs this week
sorry shorts we have diamonds hands and we’re not selling until this goes up way way up i don’t have any doubts that this squeeze will reach 500 at the peak maybe even 1000 if everyone holds their share longs are in control of this squeeze all we have to do is hold our positions and this thing will shoot way way up 
put those stop loss orders in
hold everyone and who ever can buy lets f citron and shorters
unfortunately a lot of weak hands are going to capitulate today we will probably end down a few but they dont see the forest through the trees this stock is so shorted that they are going to try to scrounge every share possible to sell the interest rate to borrow has sky rocketed and the float is probably even worse then the 140 short percentage shown a few days ago in time this has nowhere to go but up due to the sheer amount of short shares that need to be covered instead they will always do what paper hands do and chase it on the way back up closer to the peaks then sell at the valleys oh well 
the analysts haters are out in full force ryan has this
longs buying for a short squeeze they saw on tiktok u been duped by a reddit post they didnt take into account the synthetic longs live and learn look at the gme s3 s1 calculation httpswwwshortsightcomshortinterestoffloat20

who was that guy earlier that predicted 100 he is absolutely right look at the charts
gme up from below 4 to  22 this year alone today is just a small dip based on very low volume next week it’s going to the moon when the icr conference report record sales
i think people are holding off any moves until after the conference call today with citron i think there will be a huge volume spike during and after the call we know all of the negative comments citron will make however it is already baked in the future has not been specifically and intentionally not been articulated by cohen and gme until they have everything in place give it a little time maybe 45 days
hold let these shorts burn
there going to make a movie over this

up upand away
keep holding the line boys buy buy buy
the big shorters are going to try everything to bring this down today and in the end it wont matter they are stuck short in this stock even as i type its down 120 but there is just too many shares short to sustain a nice downward motion long term this stock i believe will do great new management and a beefed up online presence i want to see something like epic games with sales around 67 billion this year i believe the market cap should be at least around 45 billion but that is just my own opinion also to the people who sell out good luck as you watch the biggest short squeeze in history of short squeezes from the sidelines this one will be fun to watch
wow this thingy is really rocketing keep going baby it may close near 16 today may be some news coming today or in the weekend eat your heart out timmy boy did you move in with your mommy yetlol
stonk go up
boringgg will be back tomorrow don’t underestimate the sheer manipulation at play here as i’ve said i’m long as a value play the entertainment and potential squeeze is a bonus they will try and drill it again tomorrow so good chance to average down for anyone with a high cost basis every day we stay up is more pain for shorts
my wife said its bad karma to make fun of other people online so i apologize
easiest short in the world if you can find shares gravity always prevails
just like fastly stock im predicting it will go down again within next 2 weeks
jim crameris on our side lets go very my friends over  40 we ajmoooo 
before next week here is some important info for everyone shorts are likely to up their game to pull the price down further casestudy volkswagen short squeeze prior to the squeeze that sent prices from 100 to 900 shorts fought to keep the price down over a week they then bet everything in one major short that sent prices down but it was noted that short interest eventually became too much they were trapped retail investors and institutions started buying into it and eventually they had to cut their losses sending prices to 900what is different with gme the short interest is already significant short interest has risen over the past few days indicating they are fighting back if they win don’t sell yet the short interest by then will be double and institutions will possibly send gme to the mars by then the rocket would have taken off and you’ll be lateif they lose they’ll start to cover early and send gme to the moon instead not as high but decent estimates right now is 200 and overplease google the volkswagon short squeeze and study the charts for yourself and don’t scold the shorts we need fools like them to prep this rocket fuel
gme loses money keep buying youre already down 25 from todays fraud high soon youll be down 50 and if you hold 2 months youll be down 80
yesterday ah this was 10 now struggling to stay above 3 not a good sign momentum shift exodus at the open
this is a short attack before margin calls they need to push the price down buy the dip 
it is funny how few bashers were there during the first two runups  now they are everywhere loljust because you just bought puts doesnt mean the stock will go as deep as you want it to go
citron is eating a huge dlol lmao lol yeessssssssss hate that cheatin slimy market making creep
so you are just making it sweeter for the shorters i mean who wouldnt buy puts on this crazy thing
what happens when all these online brokers including robinhood put 100 margin requirement on gme compared to 25 4x leverage now
my question for the s is why not join our side why do you keep trying to pick up pennies in front of this bullet train were up almost 95 since last week 150 since last month 180 past 3 months 723 over the past year and heres the thing if you switched sides this thing would  even more and we could all win weve all made mistakes in our life
remember there are 71 million reported shorted shares and then there is the sho list which has his knows how many additional with 40 mil in the float we traded over 140 mil today seems lots of manipulation going on and imo shorts are unable to cover given there are just not enough shares available to cover 71 million imo tutes will ask for their shares back in the near future and we enter a major short squeeze
gme ain’t stopping
on track to reach 39 this hour
jim cramer just said gamestops run is now game over for the shorts
oh no i see eddie murphy and dan aykroyd sellingdont get caught holding the oranges
is ino on the short list
come to amc boys lots of money to be made
the float will be getting incredibly small now expect gutwrenching volatility eventually ending up in a massive short squeeze there will be a few circuit breakers remember longsdo not sell under 5001000 1000 is very possible when there are no more shares to cover with the shorts have to pay the price we set
but but but im citron i said so
shorts are fxxxxx burning
tim where you at lol
4k in it
it is going back to 17 in a heart beat
you can sign a petition to investigate citron for manipulating stock prices and help to fight with all the gay bears see you at gme 42069 httpchngitnkwfbd6cv4
26 this friday is possible
honestly due for a correction to high 20s or low 30s
25 tomorrow
another 100k shorted this nothing at 70 borrow fee cant imagine theyll hold that position too long
how is this company any different than blockbuster time to short the hell out of this
ok i have forty years experience of actively managing all my stock trades and gme has me scratching my head the stats show 140 short interest and that was before citron took its position meanwhile institutional ownership is at 117 and now i learned that since todays major upsurge coincided with option expiration day that more options finished in the money representing more shares than exist on the other hand gamestop has bought back 34000000 shares during the past year or so at an average price of a little over five bucks per share forget anything about fundamental values i cant see how shorts can ever close out their positions especially the smaller individual retail shorts after todays action im certain that brokerages issued numerous margin calls today after the markets close so the squeeze looks like it will definitely continue besides ryan cohen has publcally stated that hes aware of the vast amount of short selling on gamestop and he needs to eliminate that situation in order to operate his business in a normal way so unless mr cohen allows the company to issue more shares i simply see this as a death trap for short sellers especially the retail shorts am i missing something or not serious answers appreciated
the price will shoot up before the close of market today the shorts do not want to hold their positions over the holiday weekend next week will be worst for them don’t sell hold your positions be patient longs
bum please give us one of your deluded posts now hahaha margin call in the am brother
easy 800 tomorrow
lots of interest in this stock i have people texting me on a sunday night asking about gme and what is an infinite gamma squeeze regular folks wondering if they should jump on this in the morning
anyone that doesnt sell will never be able to sell it at this price again it will take years to reach this valuation and price again
gme price target showing as upgraded to 22 dollars any news on this
the squeeze is being squoze has it begun 
1000 not a meme
hold my warriors and together we shall pierce the heart of wall street with our throbbing tendies 
come monday there will be not posts look at the price at 5am monday its going to be bad dont every fight insiders this is hedge funds shifting risk
this stock is insane i am not invested as was expecting a pull 100 is on plate for the ones in this too risky for me at these levels tho
shorts are returning for the round trip if short hold those precious hard to borrow shares this market is about to pull back and gme is setting up nicely for a healthy retreat when this breaks 30 stops alone will drag it down i bet by months end the selling blows through 20 and settles right back to 18s then grinds lower from there as gme is trying to reinvent the wheel
honestly if you are short it is time to get out the short interest is nearly 150 of the float which make this an extremely dangerous stock to short even if you are right the stock goes to zero and you make 100 and if you are wrong you could lose 500 to 700 of your money even if you are right and a short squeeze happens you could lose 500 to 700 of your money there are too many other less risky targets in the market
easiest money of my life
the only question is does this open at 45 or 35 we all know its going under 30 soon
citron activated tons of shorts but the shorts are yet to be successful on this freight train i ain’t touching gme but it is quite entertaining
cant wait to buy the dip
is this the chat room for the casino
oh boy lol
if this is a 100 stock then apple is a 1000 stock
guess this is going to go down as another stock i sold too earlysold at 39 last week and 70that said i also held it at the low my low buy was 48 and it went down to 257so all in all i am up 24x off the low hard to ask for more
green again resistance is strong though

i just bought some four  went public last year  payment processor company with 20 year history that bought 3dcart bigc competitor in nov  reminds me of shop now has payment system and top website builder
it will be sad if citron collapses because of gme  they did present another side to all the wall street hype
there going to make a movie about how many people got rich and how many people went broke from gme
this duplicity should anger every long this is exactly why retail should be angry
buyer at 5
i did said will close 65
after gme hit 200 jim cramer will say buy gme
share price fell last earnings report to 6 dollars and hit 19 dollars this quarter gamestop is entering the best year it will have had since 2013 i wouldnt be worried about this drop
i recall ryan cohen intends to make gamestop able to beat out amazon what if his intention isnt just to grow his business to amazonian proportions but to actually make gamestops market cap bigger than that of amazon single handedly he can create such a short squeeze that the share price rises to something astronomical if he controls the company he could also prevent gamestop from issuing any more shares i know nothing of mr religious beliefs but im pretty sure sure that somewhere in the bible it states thou shall not sell what thou does not own well sounds like the bible is against short selling if thats the case shorts will literally and figuratively burn in hell i might get coaxed into selling a few shares at some ridiculous price maybe 500 but i want to see just how extreme this is going to get
when the short squeeze happens we sell our shares at the price we decide considering over 160 of the float is short put your limit sell high to make their exit expensive and painful
don’t be surprised if we don’t see 40 this week huge manipulation but this price is costing shorts millions every day
this why i don’t shortmany gurues were texting yesterday best short everi pretended to short at 42next time i looked 37next time i looked 725000 shares short would have lost150000advise shoring is worse than gambling
lets get 50 today we can do it go go gamestop
i bought again on this dip a lot of weak hands today but tomorrow will be much better patience is all you need at this point this stock will shoot up very soon and these weak hands will regret selling
46 citron effect in full swing d
i want to get into this so bad but feels like in late to the party lol
told you probably close 45
the robinhood trader youths will get burnt to a crisp messing around in this neighborhood

yep shorts are covering citron failed their following and lost all credibility today what a joke the entire campaign blew up in their face just sit back and watch the carnage as shorts cannibalize themselves looks like a breakout forming thanks to mr left give the man a pat on the back for his own self destruction

this isn’t a short squeeze the shorts would need to own roughly 3x the value of this stock this is another pump and dump you buy they crush the stock and you lose money this is simply because wallstreet bets has convinced thousands to dump their life savings into a stock will a low market cap then it will get crushed followed by panic selling followed by your life savings in the pond good luck

to all short sellers you guys are officially done no seriously this is not a hype post you are literally finished go check out wallstreetbets for those unfamiliar wallstreetbets is a forum on reddit they have over 16 million subscribers to that specific forum they put together a spreadsheet with how many people from that forum are holding shares and how many shares each person is holding after less than 12 hours of being live its already at 133m shares total there are so far only 900 responses total holdings from wsb is likely at least 10x this amountwhich would account for 20 of the float there is no doubt that they will work together to bar their shares from being lent out that or they will all set a ridiculously high sell price on their shares the shorts are finishedlet me be clear there is a 100 chance that they will all call up their brokers and set a high sell price it hasnt happened yet but it will not 99 100 chance it is happening
a company that sells games or other junk accessories should be below 20 sell at market open to avoid losing money
good god lol to think almost sold my contracts friday lol

surely there has to be big investors seeing through the lies of these analysts trying to keep this downonce they start seeing the actual potential of ryan cohens new vision and his abilities that will be the nail in the coffinthis isnt going to be anything like vw squeeze the hype will continue and accumulate short volume is so high that it will last forever this is the start of a war between visionaries against the stubborns
but that one guy from twitter said the stock will go to zero today 
thank you gamestop investors for providing the “greatest investor show on earth the way shorts bet on companies failing is appalling makes me want to buy this stock regardless of the stock price just to sink them morego gme

i’m confused do people actually think gamestop is worth this much or are they just hoping this will keep running short term so they can flip for a quick profit no one views this as a long term hold right
i dont understand why some people are pointing out the historical charts and trying to figure out where this stops at you can predict where this thing is going to go and how long its going to go for there are a ton of people already looking to move some serious amounts of money from one group to another this weekend even more will find out whats going on and will get on board monday morning is going to be insane

move to clovis oncology clvs
yeahhhhh 50 i am going crazy everyone gamestop hi from athens greece
a short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals a short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering liquidating their positions
no reason for a 5 price drop frustrating they had it down 4 off the bat with only 500k shares traded too i hope we stick it to the shorts just like they didare doing to gme they have no shame
sooooon may the tendieman come
lets not forget that citron shorted shopify at 100 and called it a completely illegal getrichquick scheme pot meet kettle

some constructive criticism for gamestop management if youre going to focus on the online experience youre going to need to provide way more detail on your product pages ive been looking at statuesfigurines and none of the pages actually provide product information like sizeweight how do you expect people to make a purchase when they dont know exactly what theyre getting take a page out of amazons playbook and provide every little detail you can so the consumer has confidence theyre buying the right item im long gme but feel theres some room for improvement on their ecommerce side

in this case you see a mutual admiration circle wherein longs appear to be praising the company which is worth at most 110 of its current value and certainly not 25b try not to be fooled it will probably reach its own kodak moment and drop like a rock the good news is that it wont drop in one day hower in the case of kodk it took 4 days to drop from 60 to 15 do your own due dilligance before investing any money

if mr cohen owns options in gme stock does he have to disclose it since he is already a 10 holder

how low gme go by options expiration day on friday 115 when investors and traders start selling and take profitany guesses my guess is around 27just saying
45 billion company wow with lot of debt does the credit goes to robinhooders
im trimming here  just sold 500  5382 13 of positionits a great run which can continue but as the saying goes you cant go broke taking a profit
here we go hold
the shorters are denying ryan cohen is onboard gme now as new managementkeep up with the news or lose more money losers
i dare every full time shorter to short this go ahead
look at bb it will be the new gme
i will laugh if gme closes at 19 today
it’ll take you to the moon if you hold
i was just messing around with this in after hours friday and lost track of time and accidentally got stuck with 300 shares long at 6485 i felt so stupid all weekend and literally couldn’t sleep last night guess it wasn’t such a bad thing
might be a lot of people losing their savings on this stock doesnt seem to want to go past 100 too many profit takers at that price might tank when lots start taking profits think it might have hit its peak be prepared to lose money if you risk it
gme has run its course how much more can they pump it up what about other stocks with big short interest like amcx with 93 of outstanding short bbby has decent short interest too
it will be a positive close if not today monday or tuesday for sure go cohen go
block out the noise
there are 30000 people commenting on this which was started on reddit people are holding and buying it
love how zacks publishes a generic article on expected decline on earnings on the first red day in a week will be laughing to the bank when the actual results blow out the low expectations
shoot i dont think there is a squeeze  frankfurt now up only 8  i think the shortsqueeze idea is not going to happen your thoughts
im adding more tuesday
so happy to see citron flop big time totally deserve it
hold the line make the shorts burn even more
i wonder how many shorts will be having to sell their homes to pay up
short squeeeze
over 60 today squeeeeeeze hahaha
gme may hit 21 ah
closing at 15 today
anything sub40 is a definite buy wait til the news drops later today from cohen
likely just a headfake just to see how much stock would pull back in the hours leasing to the call diamond hands boys hey citron where you at
jahahahahahhaha is gonna be 1000
monday more puts will expire roughly 20 of the shorts has been covered thusfar hold andor buy to be part of history the rocket will go to 100usd next week 
lets thank our boy rc
andrew left on suicide watch
congrats wsb
i called that 150
whose here since 15
150 before next er
buy buy buy stocks
before the end of this week maybe tomorrow night the next day or day after thatthe only thing we’ll hear from gme longs will be “crickets” 
sold 15 22 strike 115 expiration calls and put almost 2k inthe pocket for 5 days work not too shabby would not mind if 1500 shares gets exercised at 22just saying still has 2500 sh bought under 12
500 stock soon
no sell pleaseee
people on margin are still in disbelief believe it you have been squeezed
how do the short even cover here there is 2 million shares short more then the entire outstanding shares which i truly dont understand how thats even possible for all the people who sell out here good luck because this might be the short squeeze of the century i have been in a lot of stocks since i bought my first shares of iomega in 1989 the squeezes in expe room jcom and countless others where 3040 of the float was short but never almost 200 of the float and like i said never 2 million shares more than even outstanding today was the first part and start this squeeze every time this ticks down it will be met with covering who knows where it will go but i would not want to be on the short side here
tomorrow at this time you will be smoking a cigar and drinking a good bourbon or smoking a joint and having an afternoon delight
look at 115 call today there will be huge buying today mm has to buy underlying stockperfect storm longs are buying mm is buying shorts are covering
to the moon it is destiny
wow literally 20 minutes ago this was at 149 went to get coffee and its back down to 88
halt at 9478 anyone see this going back up today or is the jump over
just wanted to point out that trousers sold his entire 3500 share stake in sept at 618 at today’s 4552 high those shares woulda been worth 140000 more eat it trousers eat it
the dip is all the online brokers reopening  it will rise
all the shorts saying if this goes to 75 100 etc its a great opportunity to short i want you to know that the same was said for tesla thing is youre short sighted youre inability to see what a behemoth this will be in the gaming industry with the capital they have on hand as well as cohen and boys being on board speaks for your mental capacity the longer you hold the more youll burn the more you short as it goes up the more financial ruin you will be in now ask yourself is it worth being stubborn is it worth losing all your life savings just because you think this company only sells games and consoles and the future is digital but is that all they do it takes 1 announcement literally 1 announcement from the company to send us off to earth 20 which was discovered in 2020 millions of light years away  tonne of cash to swipe up more shares my entire portfolio is up on cannabis stocks total is 160k ill flip the entire thing into gme if the price dips below my entry of 37 good luck losers
be careful guys a lot of shorts covered premarket the si is now at 9768 it could tumble quickly as soon as the volume will go down a bit the other shorts will jump to cover
gamestop reached a 52 week high at 1961
300milliom increase in cash while 500 million debt reduction and 300 million in buyback
new highs tomorrow folks we may see 48
5k at 1250 2k at 5830holding until 42069
68 million shares were short on this and 59 million shares have traded as of the time im writing this 1145 am est and it is up 88 at the moment if youre heavy in this id be watching for those two numbers to match up because no sane person buys a stock that is up that much in one trading day unless theyre covering im not trying to be mean or say anything bad about the company but just be logical with what the criteria would be to sell at least some of a position
there are other ways to short a stock besides borrowing the shares and then selling them a put option will do the trick without influencing the price of the underlying shares it also is much less risky as the total possible loss is limited to what you pay for the put option short sales entail unlimited risk as the sale will eventually have to be covered and theres no limit to how high the price of the underlying stock can go people relying on a short squeeze are going to be disappointed if people shorting the stock are doing so through the use of put options rather than borrowing the stock and short selling the shares
break 40 and it’s game over for shorts
huge manipulation
keep buying it’s our chance to scare the institutions
warning guys i am 100sure that andrew left and other institutional shorties will take it personal and try to short this to hell keep united keep strong lets give the f ing shorters a very good lesson on monday we have taken this personal too mr andrew destroyer of companies and lives its our turn to burn all of you shorters down wall street bet robin hood revoluters lets take them down
breaking news citron just released 5 reasons why gme will crash1 they havent got a clue
if we take a loss today it’s still 21major manipulation here and melvin needs to closethis is still fair value lolpatience
look at gme that is how short squeeze look like nnox is 65 percent low float stock this will propel even higher with fda clearance if this stay above 55 it will explode big mention this few days ago
next stop 37
rumour something big on monday with cryptic tweet of cohen i guess he is going to pull a elon buy
you know were in a massive market bubble when a game retailer with declining sales advances over 135 just this week add gme to the list of market bubblesevs ipos bitcoin and many others
i’m still at the belief that mr cohen is all in and will increase his holding to at least up 20 and maybe morethis price drop gives him a chance to get more cheaper
this will comsolidate and explode later on
the shorters are getting nervous that why they commenting so much now
i love whats going on congrats to everyone invested here i hope citron goes bust
maarket cap history shows you the real value of gme as of today it is 18 times of one year ago with 20 less revenue the knife will definitely fall hardmarket cap intraday today 10312020 7312020 4302020 1312020 10312019 453b 68224m 25968m 37005m 25314m 49209m
how high is this going
shorts are stuck and they know it
retail longs you have had your fun cash in the chips and walk away well done
whos going to listen to the live stream
im sure these shorts dont realize lot of us are long in this since 4
limit sell 10000
tbh i don’t even care about gme as a company this is about destroying the shorts
80 closing is possible
95 lol
strong start
maybe one of the 5 reasons gme is going to 20 is because citron bought a bad webcam from them and could not perform the live stream lol loosers
i believe mr cohen will increase his ownership to almost 20 in the near future if he buys 5m shares for under 21 his cost per share will still be under 15this might put additional pressure on management
lets gooo baby
gme will be 50 before er
all hail gme they are the new amazon
you all should be taking the win not doubling down or hodling 
did they halt at 73 again wow
have they been margin called
seeing all the new shorts on this board and multiple others convinces me we are going higher maybe not today or tomorrow but very soon they can only keep a lid on the price so long with the float being over shorted by 140 patience will be key herem and to not get rattled
citron and its obtuse zombie followers we could make 40sharelong investors and those with any education were looking at 400share in months and perhaps 1000share in years
now this is time for shorts this is going down to 60 to 70 i will buy then sold mine here enough fun
you think this goes up again today bough at 72
back to 50
i held gme for couple years purchased at 30 back then it was a long term pain among all other stocks i bought luckily you guys saved me i sold at 33 but i wont buy it again as i think it will be another blockbuster good luck
mmedne gonna do the same after it passes resistance at 5
respect to all those shorts you fought bravely now watch this
gamestops mooning hold my brothers
everyone on wsb it’s over to amc now previous runs were tesla and gamestop good luck all
haha shitron take that
daddy please help me they’re bullying me again
gme gamestop to sell up to 800 million in share offering amid its incredible rally
what a daily chart trend line convergence could swing up or down another 10
any good reasons to buy this no hate but just wondering do people still buy games in brick and mortar stores  isnt it more convenient to make purchases online especially with covid around
i think you all need buy now looks like 1000 dollars share dot be late
dont listen to the short bots never seen any of these names before gme is an excellent investment and the shorts are on borrowed time they are only digging their graves deeper and deeper
if only you could bottle the emotion that thousands must be feeling this sunday waiting for market open from worried and frustrated shorts to dreamers with most of their portfolio here expecting to double by lunchtime and buy them a carim excited and im not even in it
does anyone know if there is a scheduled announcement for gamestop holiday sales id appreciate it if someone knows thanks
holddd soldierss we gonna hit 100
what time is the margin call that will spike this stock
23 years trading experience here this is a climatic parbolic blow off top its that simple
trees dont grow in the sky i have written 42 and 45 strike 122 expiration calls and put thousands of dollars call premiums in the pocket and my calls will likely be exercised  dont be greedy now way overdone just saying
watching this one from the sidelines
bb next
for those who may not have much experience w short squeezes look at the pattern of ostk last yearthe trigger was on 424 notice the uptick on heavy volumethe peak was on 820 almost 4 months over a 1500 riseheavy avg volume persisted into october55 up days 30 down daysgme is much more heavily shorted than ostk was but using a 1500 rise i expect 300 sometime in apriltrue squeezes dont happen in a matter of days shorts just cant cover that kind of volume quickly wout blowing up the share price in which case the stock will get haltedbuy and hold or even accumulate and enjoy the pattern over the next few months
beat q3 e by 032 a loss of 053 vs est of 085 but sales down 246 says positive sales and profitability in q4 they are cutting cost left and right
i was filling my pants was 20k in like 5 minutes 
i am still here from 4
new high of 4599 aka shorts have puts loaded at 46 any resistance is based off that not significantly by sellers
watching the price like
last week id figure id jump onto this with not much hope of any further highs wonder how long gme can keep this up amazing
margin call short squeeze
just watched the aleftcitron video are we supposed to believe that his purpose was to provide free advice and that there’s nothing in this for him seriously there wasn’t anything different – same old shorter statements without any specific solid  supporting data no visuals except the artwork in the background men battling to the death he said shares could be borrowed at a decent rate is the current rate decent he mentioned hedgeye paid promotion but no details he alluded to some hedge fund without naming a them is litigation a concern was he suggesting that cohen would undermine the longs the stuff about harassment  hacking wasn’t relevant nor believable this is my 3rd attempt to post this
what i want to know is was this the spark of a major market sell off or just a temporary dip talking about the entire market not just gme
42 close
ok im in love with this and amc insane days
just gotta say wow great job playing the game
let me get this straight when big boys lose they get to change marking requirements if the big boys were making doughthey would not have changed the margin requirementsthis is the problem let them eat cake boys
this will end badly
soooooo to all my new investors only hedge funds banks and large institutions can trade between 4am to 7am so this means they purchase at 13660 today this is far from over stay woke
gme sp is jumping all over and now above 14 at 1409 lets see if it goes in 15 by fridayjust saying
seriously again
longs if you all want to make more money from this short squeeze keep on buying more gme stocks shorts will not have any stocks left to buy to cover their positions unless they’re willing to pay 200 300 400we have the upper hand we are in control of how much money we can make be patient hold your positions even better buy more stocks

market is red today this is nothing lol we will finish green again easily

do we buy immediately on open or wait and see if paper hands cause a sell off
i have been trying for more than 30 minutes to purchase 1000 shares with a price per share of eur 20 much higher than the current price so far to no avail this seems very fishy
kodak reached a 1000 lets go 
the whole market crashed at once this might be way bigger than you thinki was long in this with wsb until i saw the big picturewatch out this might not be a fight between shorts vs longs in gme anymore
i do not think citron could have done a worse job if they tried citrons performance is worse then the company they are trying to unravel no wonder citron wont trade publicly they would have to short themselves for a guaranteed winner of course andrew would find a way to screw that up too left is a true blue loser
monday morning

gme in 2020 the revenue is 64b but gme market cap is only 27b and chewy in 2020 the revenue is 48b but chewy market cap is over 43b
this is where those robinhooders get slammed by professionals they came in late and nothing left to prop the stock call your moms and ask for more money
i guess the shorts are questioning what cohen can do or not can do they are holding out for failure not gonna happen one or two good announcements away from shorts committing suicide
hold or sell
httpsyoutubezmwb62lpvuw
i smell a short squeeze on the horizon probably early in 2021
who else cant wait for market open
well theres no question at this point this stock action will go down in history
 bought at 13 sold at 36 fomod at 4220 with much smaller position should’ve hold 
there is a possibility this stock will hit 50 and squeeze above 100 this is such a dangerous time for shorts as the amount of speculative money sloshing around is scary sigl case in point gme is trending on every platform right now
new short today when over 40 niceyou have got to be kidding me that all of this is over someone joining the board
gme has been the winner of winners for me this year thanks again rc

shorts better start covering before you get margin called
the squeeze has just begun this will go on for days or weeks or even months imagine how high this can go i would not sell yet much more room for this to move up hold your shares and be patient triple digits is around the corner let’s go gme longs

a company that lost a billion dollars in the last 2 years is suddenly worth 100 a share this isnt investing its gambling and when people cash out the bag holders are going to get hurt bad
seems a lot of people are buying gamestop on line sales up 300 that is incredible
they say the next stock traders are going to push is clov because of high short interest
dont stop gamestop
what is the pt i think 500
delaying the short squeeze by short selling more shares only makes the short squeeze even squeezier
keep buying my fellow investors  if you miss the chance you will be very sorry later 
shorts lining up at the soup kitchen rn
citron screwed the pooch they are recording and will post later as too much hacking on twitter account doesnt say much for twitter nor citron
congrats longs what a great day today was mainly longs buying and only a small amount of shorts covering this is going alot higher in the longterm
pmpg starting to move already up 40 expected to reach above 100 by next week
does anyone know the current interest rate being charged to short and if the shares are still classified as “hard to borrow” when we get to 20 next week 100 percent down for those who shorted at 10 with interest on top of the loss the weaker hands among the shorts will start buying to cover if one positive thing comes out of earnings n the 8th a small buyback positive update on black friday sales some positive guidance etc and we avoid the usual doom and gloom post earnings sell off then the squeeze will be for real if that happens i say 25 post earnings
5 days to cover
shorts stop selling as soon as it goes green this is not a day to sell stock you green behind yuseeese
oh what a perfect storm
stimulus pkg being passed today before noon look for a big price surge today

the same faith awaits you as all those newly minted bitcoin holders
chwy which ryan cohen built is worth 40b gme has the probability to surpass that market cap
what did cohen announce and when
i think the coming week will see few big boys to join in to downgrade the shares or to initiate with sell ratings this party of short squeeze will be over within the week if not on monday and the shares will fall it is also possible the company itself will have to come out to issue some statements that they are not aware of any merger deals or something and they may even come out to issue a secondary offering to help cool the market and take profit in this run to help pay down its heavy debts
as i mentioned i knew it would dip a little to lure in more shorts then explode again i bought puts at 141 
i guess citron is broke now
let this ride to 100 at least before you shave your earnings
wallstreetbets are dumping tomorrow double their money and take profits
buy buy hold hold repeat
short  of float dec 31 2020 26091the risk of loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited since the price of any asset can climb to infinityi still think this has the potential to explode much higher just need a motivated buyer
why is this going up so much is it too late to enter now
lmao do they thinking halting will stop the rocket to the moon ahaha how much did citron pay them to halt xd the the moon
i dont get this at all
here is where i had expected a short squeeze to be going by the enthusiasm of the last few dayssadly i cant seem to find the exhilarating rises in the stock price that would reflect that reality
keep buying this thing will cause margin calls on the shorts
we´re squeezing the shorts they had 70 million stocks to buy back at close last friday they need to buy them all back so just hold and buy more and this will go far beyond 300
but aitx and hold see 2 week chart

found this on the edward jones website but again yahoo will not let link be posted site requires login for access “… tue dec 15 124429 cst 2020 reuters  wall street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets on several uslisted companies including…” “… gamestop corp  ascendiant capital raises target price to 12 from 550 …”andrew woo at ascendiant capital is listed under analyst coverage on gamestop’s website the following link httpswwwtiprankscomanalystsedwardwoo reflects the upgrade of course 12 seems to be in the rearview mirror odd that yahoo isnt reflecting all these recent upgrades and that gme isnt posting these in the news section of its website
pre market looking good above all hold naked short interest has increased yesterday 
prepare for the chaos
okaverage out you will still loose money today lol

holding until 1000

thank all seacrest out
shorts trying to shake weak hands hold strong and longs win
needs to go up
we rate gme underperform given our belief that multiple structural headwinds centered around digital disintermediation will continue to weigh on earnings and cash flow gme currently has a significant cash position which we expect to be used to pay down debt and repurchase shares however with the risk that free cash turns negative over the next few years earnings support from capital return will ultimately fade and likely be overwhelmed by persistently declining operating earnings
get this to 100 tonight boys
everyone talking about the insane short squeeze that’s bound to happen is that really a guarantee if people sold to lock in their profits then this stock would crash no
omg im rich
perhaps we can speed this along by filing complaints about the sec’s failure to enforce regulation sho 17 cfr 242200 et seq go to httpswwwsecgovcomplaintselectshtml and then click on the link to file a complaint with the ombudsman to reach httpsommssecgov  maybe select options and office of enforcement about midway down in the body ask for an explanation of sec’s failure to enforce the regulation sho 17 cfr 242200 et seq gamestop corp gme has been continuously on the threshold list since dec 8 2020 through jan 13 2021 short activity exceeds the float by such a huge percentage that it is obvious that gme is being subjected to naked shorting ask why the sec hasn’t enforced the sho delivery  closeout requirements ask for a written response explaining this the form is short and doesn’t require one name namesoffenders those fields can be left blank
this will reach well over 100 next week

oh lord all these ppl gonna lose their life savings look at the posts
if you are a stock market bull you don’t want to see this stock keep going up irrational exuberance is a sign of a major bubble
this seems very fitting for a country where the presidential vote was allowed to be stolen now the crooked brokerage firms want to stop the trading because they will lose  criminal activity has been allowed to go on and on as long as it was only the little guy that got hurt but now the big institutions have boxed themselves into a trade where there is no way out could this hit 200  take a look at the volkswagen porsche short squeeze they had to call in their lawyers to negotiate a way out because they couldnt buy back their position
how would this hold up after hours
no bears when it rises and theyre back out on the dip trying to save their positions smh

are people serious they think triple digits 
in a short squeeze valuations do not matter it’s about covering short positions before you go broke i’ve seen stocks go up 10 fold in 2 days getting squeezed of course they go right back down after t
it’s hard to believe that at this very moment there are still people willing to pay 88 per share for this stock
mac has 80 million shares short and their mall business is 95 back to normal
time to buy more
buy high  sell higher this is rule for that meme stock of thr decade
shorts are waiting for the longs to fold so they can buy at a lower price hold your shares and wait for next week shorts will be forced to cover their margins then patience fellow longs
awwwww william got his feelings hurt so he had to mute me can’t just respond and defend his reasoninghave an actual discussion
why does it always get beaten down after hitting the high of the day early in trading very frustrating
omg trousers i cost you 300000 when i forced you to sell at 618 i own you ps thank you for confirming you read all the mocking of you i did last week you’re great
citron research was livethe end
it wants to close above 60 so bad
we all know what the next step for cohen isceo
that will teach those shorts a big lesson i hope 150 soon
it’s going to open around 70
how many people show all their cards when playing poker and keep winning

if squeeze happened why would we be still at 60 lmao squeeze hasn’t even started wait for market close when institutions get their margin call
lets goo ice been buying for a week now 200 shares
ready with buckets to be filled up with shorters tears
regardless of what one thinks about the model the price is a steal just on valuation 880m in market cap and 600m in cash with manageable debt 1x sales this compares to a lot of high fliers in the nasdaq trading at sky high valuations of 4050x sales with cost cutting and a pivot in strategy the company doesnt need to do much to become a solid cash flow machine id rather own this which has room to run versus the other stocks which can drop 80 when investors return to normalized valuations
don’t think this is even close to done
id just like to ask one more time as the board is slowing down what short seller has a page in their playbook that accounts for millions of retail investors controlling their accounts in addition to a pandemic induced recession you know just as little as we do
a certain prominent publication reported last week that gme was overvalued at 18 today they felt the need to reiterate their negative consensus can’t say which publication as it gets removed
yall are play russian roulette musical chairs when the music stops alot of folks are putting a fully loaded gun up to their heads i do hope im wrong but this new type of trading and economy etc etc always loses to the old guys on ws always 
when sheeple get excited always short stocks that go up this fast will always come down as fast once the hype is over
still have belief about 50 at the end of the day dd

buy more shares if you want this squeeze to explode i bought 1000 shares today and will be buying more if there are any dips the short squeeze is just beginning this will go on until the last of the short sellers are squeezed out there is no limit on how high this squeeze will get up to this is the biggest opportunity for us to make major money in our lifetime don’t let it go to waste hold your positions until this thing explodes to the moon
don’t sell fellow longs the stock price will be consolidating for a while before it shoots up once the shorts gets margin calls and realizes that this squeeze is for real they will fold and start covering that’s when this squeeze will shoot up be patient

for a combined gamma and short squeeze to occur hordes of people would need to purchase the highest strike price call option available that is set to expire 29 january last week the highest call strike was 60 with a 060 premium per contract on fridaycboe has since increased gme’s highest strike to 70 with a 805 premium regardless of the fact these contracts expire in 6days in other words cboe is trying very hard to dissuade people from bto the 70 call with the considerable premium assigned to it if they are successful there won’t be an “infinite” squeezethe mm’s have a lot of tools at their disposal to “tone down” market sentiment a premium of 805 call contract will dissuade a lot people from taking that chancecheers and good luck to all
yeah this thing dropping 100 points
underweight
there arent any more shares left
tried to short and got burnt badly last time not going to do it againlongs are controlling this as shares are not available to short i am going long now bought 225 shares today on a dip  37 will try to recover my losses after selling this for over 50 lets do it longs
imho anyone who shorts stocks deserves to lose money period end of storytotally antithetical to what the stock market was created forto build up companies not destroy them
gme might hit 50 today in spite of dow down nearly 200 pointsnever thought it could move up so fast so soon citron research is done that why they say shorting a stock is a lot more dangerous than buying in shorting the stock can go to 300400 or 500 while being long  it can only go to zero thats the difference between being short and longwhere are shorters johd d tim and ericln have disappeared all big losers too i have made over 60k in gme just in last six weeks just saying
do not sell guys were green and up 15
wsb is back on 
if everyone keeps buying everyone becomes millionaires what a game

46m shorted shares today wonder what the short interest is today
i love gamestop and all but i think this valuation is too insane going short
this will go sideways for 1030 min and then up
this is epic
why anyone would sell right now doesn’t make any sensepatience peoplegamestop made 1b revenue in each of the last three quarters while having better utilization each and every quarter as there earnings is getting better all while at the end of a console cyclegamestop trading at 1x earnings and tesla trading at 30x earningsnow u tell me who has more to lose if they don’t live up to quarterly earnings moving forward
that was a short squeeze it happens either way just be patient and buy the dips if you can
gamestop is the next 1t company just watch
imagine being emotional over a stock and losing moneystop being so stubborn shorts the only way for this stock is up until 1000 dollars

market cap is 45b price is 65 it means there are only 69m shares and 68m of it are held by shorts who need to cover as revenue continues to rise and company changed managment to become profitable and there will be no more bashing news on company shorts will fight for the last shares to cover as share price will get higher and higher faster tomorrow per second

breaking news citron just gave out 5 reasons why gme will drop to 201
ten minutes
going to brake 200 this week
60 hit the dead aim
this is why i never short stocks ever the market is a highly irrational beast
tim did you short more at 20
lets go big day get in
i just bought a ps4 game on my phone via the psn app before the holiday sale ended after my purchase the game was downloading to my ps4 without me even turning it on this is way more convenient than buying a physical disc gme is dead
the real bleeding starts when the volume slows down
motley fool a third hit piece on gme in a week must have many shorts on retainer
the only thing that will save the shorts this week are automatic halts we showed no mercy on friday and this week will be no different trading halts will only temporarily stop the bleeding well open the wound right back up and push to 100
lets buy all the shares below 40 d
very good takehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvucg3xamirli
take some profits and come over to apt
the atthemarket offering is really interesting my reading of the registration on edgar says they are authorized to issue up to 300m shares of common stock but they have to date issued only 70m of that 300m any additional shares they issue will provide capital for gme to operate and innovate but unfortunately each share issued will be dilutive to all of you already owning shares anyone with a different reading of the filing feel free to chime in disclosure no positionhttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardata1326380000119312520312781d50019ds3asrhtm
andrew left right now
massive short squeeze wow just wow my calls are exploding
my buddy just called me and said he bought gme in a rush at 13500 and he is not sure what to do now what would you guys advice him
hold hols hold hold i’m in since 13 so trust me  hold hold hold hold 
i want to see melvins cheeks spread wide for a full gape before we start shoving pineapples in
the is more to go well see 200300
warning this will gme you shorts rmo has revenue  32 profits  and is amzn supplier for its ev delivery trucks battery through lion so you all need to do your due diligence and wait for it to double your 
halted never a good sign historically 3 halts is typically a massive crash
gonna be fun to come back this afternoon and see this at 25 and read the maroons yelling to hold and buy buy buy lulz
there is no reason at all for anyone to sell this year sit back and enjoy
dont see any negative comments when were going up and soon as there is a halt they all come flooding out selling any shares you have now may be the biggest regret youll have in life if the big boys with millions are holding then you hold too if you get off youll be left behind
theres a bid on the jan 29 8 put
sec wont fulfill its obligation to uphold sho regs but anytime fat cat hedge funds lose money the trading get halted repeatedly
funny how you bears come on this board and say this is a pump and dump but advertise your own ticker hoping for a pump
that sweet sweet margin call is coming bears
longs you’ll regret it if you sold low we have tons of upside your shares are worth gold 
200 lets goooo
short bots unloading on the board dozens and dozens of names i have never seen before do not sell you will be rewarded
looking over different stock boards youtube ect there is a lot of people posting short messages along with articles in an attempt to make people sell i really believe there are some big players trying to get out of their short position
guys try to sell around 510 percent and let it build support thats how we get sturdy growth
i predict that a lot of selling will take place on january 4 and drive the price down however their announcement on whatever day they provide an update on current quarter sales will recover any loss in the short run of selling gains for 2021 cohen then puts a note out on his pressuring gme management to continue the digital transformation and one more round of up tick takes place prior to cohen making an offer to take it private
the most insane pump in the history of the stock market
hello shorts it’s me margin
when fear and reality set in people will start selling at taking their profits it will be like a snowball going down hill fast sell now and take your profits while you still can dont hold this thing over the weekend
citron would have hedged all these hedge funds would have only amateur retail shorts caught lose  short again lose more 
cya at 150
why have they not suspended trading because there is alot more runway ahead go gme
only 7000 more shares left to borrow keep buying if the shares cant borrow they wont be able to cover which means they will just continue losing money until they cover which they cant since theres not enough shares in the market
at some point people have to take a sober step back and evaluate the business ecosystem  we cant be emotional about the positions we take this business model is archaic and needs a serious overhaul even the companys bank uses an assetbacked lending program to fund their operating line this is typically used for companies that are floundering and high risk of failure stop blaming shorts every market needs shorts and longs thats how the market works shorts pay a premium to have the pleasure of shorting a stock  unlike those going long if the company was strong enough there would be more than enough buyers in the market to outpace the shortsand when you make your wins going long on a stock who are you taking from shorts maybe some of the wins from themthe majority comes from other people going long who chose to buy when you were selling the market is zero sum
were are on again
that people put any faith in a rat firm like citron  is beyond me
seeking alpha comparing ryan cohen to chamath palihapit as a visionary leader
this past week has been exciting but there is more in store upper management has been quiet they see whats happening and believe me they are happy march earnings will be marginally better due to covid but expect future guidance from cohen any announcement he makes entailing his future for gamestop will further rally this stock also issuance of shares from the shelf offering once the shorts are of no consequence things are looking up long term hold and buy more
just because fomo allin type day traders are buying this doesnt mean there arent institutions who wanna take profit
this week will be 3 digits 250 here we come good bye shorts
bracing for red tomorrow but worry not my diamond handed friends it will be but a fleshwound  and remember there are a metric ton of diamond handed  with huge positions right beside you that have demonstrated their resolve to never sell we will dine on the moon together in good time
im not  selling
so there are those on these boards with the following argument there are 15mm calls representing 150mm shares more than double the shares outstanding this means as those call expiration dates approach the call sellers need to aquire 150mm shares of hte underlying stock which doesnt exist to deliver them to the call buyers there are several fatal flaws in this argument that should be obvious to anyone with a knowledge of financial markets heres the biggest one in order to exercise your call option you need to have enough money to buy the underlying securities you have the option on ive viewed plenty of posts of reddit and that vast majority of players here have huge portions of their net worth in short dated and sometimes barely in the money calls the only option for most of these players is to sell the calls because they could never afford delivery of the underlyingso come expiration youll see long call selling and short call covering essentially neutralizing the underlying shares needed for delivery
i remember this board was so toxic in early 2019
wallstreetbets got closed down that means the squeeze is imminent 
chapter 1
cohen is laughing all the way to the peanut patch he knows the day will come when this day will be regretted by the shorts today will be prolonged pressure on the downside until after the citron call late afternoon rally will be strong on the up side
the game stops here for the shorties we ride at dawn boys yeehaww
this is going to end badly for a lot of people wow
so they going to buy this to 500 1000 why bother having a stock market at all
buy more shares it must be at least 100 per share
rates gonna go up nz underestimated inflation by 25x rip overpriced stocks aapl tsla msft gme
they are so desperate  even investopedia was turned against gme bulls dont listen to finmedia they having huge conflicts of interest
yes it will be a negative open but a positive close shorts will not want to be short over the weekend too much risk if a positive release comes after the close this goes to 50 in a heartbeat
tan bum were waiting for your expert opinion about the new board members
this is the last day for short sellers to cover their short position and use it as a tax write off
melvin and andrew right now
ty for the dip
high volume almost 200 million shares traded but only 70 million shares exist
i could sell now at a big profit but fellow soldiers bought highwe stand with you
ibd shares available down to 30k and interest rate going up as it goes higher im sure there will be new lenders looking to cash in on the interest but this has been correlated with all of the large spikes not necessarily causal but fun to watch and speculate
thats a dip buy while you can
cant not wait when gme shares pass 7676 chaching
now would be a fantastic time for cohen to throw a bone
1000 is coming the shorts that dont cover are reckless and incompetent investors any sign of a bullish turnaround will destroy their thesis the funds are especially horrible using mom and dads money to short a company to the ground destroying a lot of wealth on the way it backfired and they were too prideful to cover its too late for them now and they will pay full price to cover
sec needs to be investigated why do they have to a halt when the stock is going up and it falls right after the halt is lifted this is market manipulation
i relaly hope it dips so i can buy 1000 more shares
current position 1014 shares  40 gonna buy 26k more limit sell  1069420
ahahah game broke again
is this going to 200

sold my position yesterday run 26 to 35 regret itgonna come anyway just to see shorts get killedlets go bulls might take a little positon 100 shares when opens not sure
when does the crying start this will go down hard at some pointdont be greedy this seems like a good cash out point while others are chasing
just added another 1k shares doing my part
everybody read this  plan plzz everybody is saying that the gme sqeeze will look like the vw sqeeze and that it’s similar well not exactly hear me out at the time the vw sqeeze was happing shorts only had 1 of total shares available to cover with whilst 124 was shorted so a ratio of naturally 1 to 124 gme has has around 140 of total shares shorted but there are also much more available shares 30 is the estimate that gives us a ratio of around 46 so what i’m saying is that we can make sure the sqeeze will be big by buying the remaining shares and i know that’s allot of shares but if every single one of you buys what they can it will have a big impact and drive the price out of this galaxy more or less so go out there people and get to the moon together with this effort 
it’s halted
150 end of the day easy
its going to move like this for a week
hitting 40 again lets go boys lets get 45 by eod
ryan cohen is fully aware of the short sellers and how damaging it is to operate a business with well over 100 short interest he will take measures to get rid of them obviously by making the share price go way high im positive thats part of his overall plan
bring the stock up ten times for no apparent reason smart

im a millionaire now thanks
hey longs i just bought more shares at the dip this morning if you’re tired of waiting for the big squeeze and you want to make this stock shoot upwards keep on buying the shares the huge purchase demand will push up the price and force the shorts to cover margin calls will happen as the price goes up let’s go and destroy these shorts
when should i sell
remember all the new shorts have no clue about gamestop and their ways and the old shorts still don’t have a clue
get in now before its too late as soon as daddy cohen drops the bomb we

lpcn is the next big one its not too late to get in
sooner or later we will see a new high a matter of days not weeks
if they dilute shares im highly considering to yolo on this
anything that starts out sponsored post report abuse  looks like spam
so buy 10 or not
i assume all these gamblers are on robinhood and can’t trade until 9 so it might move later but with options expiration that will make it tougher
i think gme is going to hit 200
shorts are sitting on a pot of gold if they can just scoot over that moneys ours thank you very much
pretty sure this will rocket in the afternoon once puts expire
no volume
the force awakens
load up charts showing 247 close today
fubo has almost the same percent of short ratio as gme but not as much might get gamma squeeze like gme citron shorted this stock today buy inverse of citron everytime and it work nnox has high short interest with low float too citron in trouble lol
the same 3 bears downvoting every bull post before their morning shift at the bank selling trash options to old people
still the most shorted stock in the 229 year history of wall street the first stock where more shares are shorted than are even outstanding and they have added to their short even as the price went from 4 to 40 as the interest rates sky rockets on the price of borrowed shares there is one man named andrew left still standing in our way a guy who has been horribly wrong on every call over the last 3 years who today will give a new interview explaining how he has no vision and how you can lose money like him i cant wait until i pick up cheaper shares
jim cramer covering gme right now on mad money
cmon people they were on the verge of bankruptcy last year next gen console sales saved them but provide no future for them people are buying games digitally
has the gme come out of woods or fundamental changed dramatically i did not see any positive news on the companys financials except changes in the board i am not convicted in price appreciation on just change in the board unless any business model or prospects changes i am bearish on th stock
shorts do you see our strength yet have you stopped being blind
so what can this stock do today
gamestop is massively undervalued compared to brick and mortar competitors and deeply undervalued compared to ecommerce companies under new boss ryan cohen of chewy megasuccessmajor deal
i have not been investing as long as some but i don’t think that people on reddit usually win the battle between short sellers not invested here but good job to everyone wish i was
hey guys if we all won’t sell we don’t need er to be good  lol
europe volume is just crazy this will go 100
will fall like a stone going into the close if not tomorrow morning after the open buy puts this kind of opportunity doesnt come around often
they allow shorts to hammer a stock down but halt it when they’re getting slaughtered that’s a bunch of garbage
i like how people are upset it’s only up 35 from open if it opened up 5 and closed up 35 you’d all be gloating around the board about how unstoppable this stock is
did citron read the seeking alpha article
there are way better stock too riskyup with no reason
i usually never average up initial price at 18 but i just bought 50 more shares at 52 because this will take off 
at this point it will hold as mentioned 2 days in a row don’t expect more for a while may be a small dip
everyone who has a 40 dollar average just average down its not that hard its easy stuff
holdddd strong

one has to love the battle going on between the longs and the shorts in gme i’ll give you my thoughts why i am longwhen i look at gme’s business it is driven by console sales cycles fy20 marks the end of the product life cycle for two major consoles and essentially will be the trough in earnings gme was also impacted in fy20 by store closures due to covid as we move into fy21 gme will see a revenue lift from the start of the new console cycles combined with store traffic improving as covid restrictions subside hedgeye in their video presentation this week highlighted revenue projection in fy21 of 677b with ebitda of 333m and eps of 270share my own projections are similar by any valuation metric 036 ps 13x pe 8x evebitda looking at fy21 gme is not overvalued at 3550sharei hear a lot of shorts saying gme is the next blockbuster when i hear that statement i know they have not done their due diligence blockbuster went bk in 2010 because it was loaded with debt 1b and did not have enough cash flow to cover operating expensesinterest let alone pay down debt gme’s debt level stands at 291m and they will have a net positive cash position of 150m at the end of the fy payment of maturities due in 2021 73m and 2023 218m are easily covered from cash flow a company that is net cash positive having positive ebitda with a debtebitda of 1 is not going bk anytime soon maybe at the end of the new console cycle 57 years down the road if the next generation does not include disk drives then gme will have a risk of bk this assumes they cannot pivot their business operations to be more ecommerce focused with ryan cohen joining the board i would not bet against themi have explained why i am long gme from a valuation basis but the real opportunity for longs still lies ahead due an incredibly unique situation current short positions in gme are 796m share whereas outstanding shares are 698m with a float of 469m having a situation where short positions are greater than 100 of the float is rare and greater than 100 of outstanding is maybe a first a lot of naked short positions in almost every occasion where this has happened it has ended badly for shorts how did this situation happen many shorts were betting that gme would go bk ahead of the start of new console cycle and were also counting on the new consoles to be only diskless versions neither outcome occurred and shorts were too stubborn to cover this summer when shares were in the 45share range now shorts are stuck in their positions members of wsb and other value oriented investors recognized this abnormal situation and have started buy shares in a massive way as they know in this situation fundamentals do not really matter wsb is essentially bear hunting several big wall street firms that are short including melvin capital similar to what happen last year with tesla they will keep buying more shares driving prices higher and higher until the shorts eventually capitulate which is the real end game when that happens the shares will move quickly higher with unlimited loss potential a short squeeze if short positions are closed at an average price of 60share we are looking at short positions losing billions ouch but i think the peak price could be considerably higheri would caution retail investors from shorting gme at this point as this could be a short massacre these wall street firm would love to have you to take their place and hence they have been blanketing the media with negative stories to get retail investors who they know do not do proper due diligence to fall for their false narrative trying to short at this point is the inverse of catching a falling knife very bloody if you are wrong wait for the completion of the short squeeze before considering short selling in the meantime you may want to getting on the rocket that is just starting to take off

is going back up no worries
millions of investors have just been introduced to the emerging short squeeze at gamestop due to a tremendous amount of media coverage i was fortunate enough to begin buying up gme last fall around 6 but if i hadnt already been an investorspeculator i would certainly jump on this fast moving train right now thus expect a huge influx of new buyers clamouring for a piece of the action andrew left may he rest in peace my sincere condolences
shorts coming out to bash it down
market makers dropped whole market to get stop losses to free shares
i dont usually do this but i wonder where all the shorties are
at this point the old shorts got squeezed out while new ones came on its a self filling infinite cycle  every share is spoken for 10x over
if it breaks 3855 the shorts are in more trouble
there are no buying of call options expiring jan 29th past 60 massive puts after hours 5 will go past 15 or more on open
glad i bought 35 feb 70 puts stock will be back to 20 by thenits a mall store that sells games boring and unprofitable for a long time to come imo

a lot of newbies learning a hard lesson today
some consolidation is not bad will fly even more after foming high 30s support lvl
napalm shorts today
shorts your time is up
do not get this wrong the bad guys in the story are the funds who in a reckless and dangerous manner attempted to destroy wealth by shorting a company to the ground the retail shorts only followed their parade and now they try to flip the script on us they lost a drop in their ocean of silver spoon capital by illegally and abusively shorting a company and manipulating stock price with the help of the financial medias slander and ridiculous price targets they tried to make dumb money sell at every round they shorted shares that didnt even exist and they hurt a lot of small time investors on their path of destruction the bear thesis is dead because of ryan cohen and they burned their clients cash because they were too prideful to even consider covering when the train of news longs jumped aboard after reading the great due dilligence and publicly listed information on this stock remember that some of these funds like goldman sachs are the same people who orchestrated the 2008 market crash destroying the american economy and a lot of jobs they tried to destroy gamestop now that it failed they want to paint us the small retail investors as a horde of savages who coordinatted to pump the stock no there is not a reddit army no this is not market manipulation all we did as retail investors is read publicly listed information do our research and decided on our own to buy the stock shut up and take the loss shorts and retail shorts please cover while there is still time i dont want to see you guys lose money
green green green
these weak hands are slowing down the inevitable if you’re unsure sell now and get out let the longs hold our positions so we can get this short squeeze kicked up to the next level i’m holding until this thing shoots way up
nice they triggered cb buy after cb
lol ecommerce up 300 i guess left left that out insiders selling already explained gamestop has good cash flow three new members not old management
long live gme
hold your positions longs this is just another tactic for the shorts to buy your share at a lower price you have the upper hand you will make a lot more by holding longer be patient
yeah i think im sidelining this good luck everyone make some money and dont get bit
overall stock market crash coming gme is done
what did i say shorts get out now please because this is only the beginning
going to jump in on this monday robin hood style

line up here in an orderly fashion i understand you didnt mean to sell 2160 i feel bad for you but well open 7250 monday thats not fair
stay serious and collected this share is growth if you sell at a low price you lose earnings dont do it wait for large threedigits numbers my friends 
why sell i will not until it hits at least 60 it was in that range the last year it made profits except their are 13 less shares butthe trend is now up instead of down the category is exploding and the cycle refresh will last at least 15 years cha ching
currently in with 420690
tomorrow should be interesting
this will open at 40
the thing with gme is that with the new management and strategy plus all the short interest there is no urgency at all to take profit let the sp run theres so much more space to go
i just went all in no more dip to average down
do not sell people  we can short squeeze them foreal
it’s an illusion boys look at the volume
dont sell not the top
amc is next and deservedly so we want movie theaters just like we need gamestop it’s just an american thing

jedd you still around this is your time
buy 10 shares and make 2000 930 will be fun but when buy ins happen at 100pm that will be the best party squeeeeze
chad cramer still cant find tan has anyone seen him
gamestop will be proof that we are in a new era of investing things just don’t work the way they used to and boomers are at a loss for words potential is everything now and gamestop has more than enough potential to be ryan cohens next chewy get on board we are going to the moon
whoever sells here is going to miss out on the greatest short squeeze in the history of the market cant  wont  
new longs listen up a down day here is not the end of anything dont be fooled by articles you here or the famous timberrrr posts from shorts there is a material transformation underway at gamestop it will take a period of time for the market to realize this find the youtube channel roaring kitty he has tracked gme for 2 years look at bed bath bynd left for dead last summer at 6 per share its 28 now gme is the only brick and mortar store dedicated to gaming the gaming space is a 200 billion dollar industry they are making money and have an activist investor on the board who owns 19 of the shares shorts either covering or shorting more is just gravy on top what the stock does today or even this month is not the story
too many amateur swing traders here
happy new year to whomever bought the 900k shares after hours i hope you know something we don’t
how many more shares are there to squeeze dont you think a lot have already been covered amcx looks like the better next play with 93 of float short
my lorrddddddddddddddddddd
bb is next 
a nice recovery from 1856 at the low today and i think a critical point would be if we can close over 20 i think that just validates this is year end strategies to sell for tax reasons if you are short and for those shorts that want to delay and hope this declines in the new year to minimize losses good luck with that strategy there is more to the msft partnership than we all know regardless it may take time but this is not going to deteriorate in price much below 20
ps ratio  1 how can you not buy this stocks guys
watching the shorts freaking out on this board no better way to spend my day off
gme bull case target is 169 httpswwwgmeddcomreportmodel
just a thought power up rewards membership is kind of lame discounts on pre owned games and points reward system is outdated everyone loves free stuff why not increase the fee to say 50 bucks a year but offer free digital game downloads for your console of choice including steam that are on monthly rotation games that wouldnt be offered on plus or gold for the month that would be very enticing to gamers who have all the consoles what do you think
gee i didnt know gme was so profitable i better buy it for the long term
once in a lifetime for us long to make a fortune at the fastest rate hold your positions and enjoy the ride
everyone can still get some buy now and don’t fomo later when the bois are rich
damm good thing load up at discounted price
anyone else smelling a lot of desperation in the air this morning
if you believe everyone has a limit sell order at 42069 and that’s why the stock is guaranteed to hit that price i just started my own company and it’s the next amazon send direct investments to my paypal lol
this is following technicals today to the t
let’s meet up
cost myself 100k more why did i sell probably cost myself 200k now why
ohhh doctor my 40 call options expiring tomorrow are going to make me start looking for vacation homes in the mediterranean thank you mr cohen you are a genius and for all of you who have shares do not sell tomorrow if you do you will only help the shorts 100 per share isnt out of the question
shorts getting backs broken
imagine if that letter from andrew left was a bluff to get people to take profits and he still holds his short position
still up 37 today
can this hit 50 today
halted again 
mr cohen needs to thank the shorts for keeping this price artificially low so he can buy more
only paper hands are losing money hold
uppppppppppp baby lets gooooo hollld
gme friends dumping profits here also going in bb  amc  aqb
boom sell off  halted taking a little off the table
i’m holding until 1000 hahahaha lets gooo
cant  wont  
gme can and will do a massive equity dilutive dump at a big discount to market great fir the company but will mitigate short position
keep in mind ostk went to 128 on business change this is better
attention all please remain buckled in as we take off to mars today 
looks like a bear trap
let’s gooo
monday opening 76 and closing 98 this is a 20 b company now just 4 times salesnot bad
feels like im watching an episode of the show billions lol
it is time to short squeeze opk after you gme holders are done playing here
so much for the efficient market theory
aaaaand green
gme is going to be like tesla to the moon and then to mars
shorties margin calls held daily at 230 est
they opened up 75 strike calls get in
shorts shares available dropped from 250k to 60k seems they are trying to stop the upward move
i keep hovering a bit under 1000 gain this needs to go up
just added another 30 shares
18 point drop in 20 seconds lmao  dang
this is similar to gme germany we are entering a new round
truly missed a great short gamestop had to be one of the worst retail stores i’ve ever seen
bought the mf dip
i bought 3 set of put with different strike price and expiry date 
who here shops at gamestop nobody okay im not to worried
next week it will either go to 100 or 20 one thing for sure someone will lose his pants
a weekend profit day all the other stocks are red if it doesnt drop too much today it will rocket harder next week if this ends up with green today that will be the end of the shorts
never understood why people are so angry against gme  if you dont like it dont trade it  theres plenty of other stocks out there you dont have to short every stock you have a negative view on
the fact that gme held up so well over a 130 rally gives huge credibility to the bulls
shorts are absolutely done for lmao what you get for being brain dead and betting against cohen i guess
my target value is 30 but it’ll probably hang around 60 to 75 by end of year
my god the shorts were never more wrong than on this one i knew theyd lose all their money im sad i sold 4k shares at 1380 the stress of the swings here were too much to me and i got out with a measly 35 i wish i could find where those shorts have moved onto to find another winner
breaker is going to kick in cause its a rocket just hold  weve been through this before
all signs point to at dip then recovery you smoking crack rock if you think this can go more then 216 on the month then again im just speculating based on charting signs wsb could verywell send this higher but i doubt it im going to buy some puts
i love free money
who ever missed under 55 buy now will close 65
im new to this so just out of curiosity do you guys think on monday it will continue to skyrocket or will it drop because post market it showing a 4 drop
nobody wanted this stock at 3 and now people are buying at 60 
on the 30 35 and 40 puts for next week come on fillvois haon safs ciic vgac hyln nkla gte gsat niu calls
pltr will become king
please do not forget to tie up your gme shares in a limit sell order of 1000 or so they must be tied up to stay out of shorties hands
i guess something to consider is that last time we got big news rc increasing his shareholder stake to 129 the stock barely moved on that same day it moved massively the day after
citron should give one more sell callwe will replicate what gme did 
cant wait shorts going to get crushed yall keep thinking the short squeeze has happened already lol
congrats everyone short squeezes work well for people that take profits they end poorly for those who don’t
short sellers lost 16 billion betting against gme on friday alone they’re all scared right now  don’t sell keep holding or buying 
only 30k shares available to short httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme
i cant wait for cohen to do a press release with full turnaround details monday afternoon deep value longs are willing to hold this shorts dont be mistaken
they tried to bring the stock down before margin calls djust hold and sell your shares for 500
good thing i sold some when i did still lost a few hundred good thing i’m not in the big leagues lol
if someone has puts for march they dont have to cover right now or are you saying that you believe that people will continue this game through march 
8 minutes until margin calls begin
shorts on here are just working against the clockin the short run you might get some down days but eventually and soon the huge number of short shares are going to bite and bite hard the turn around plans are coming with cohen the shorts are really desperate here and you can see it with all the short poster citron ect time x 140 of float short x interest rates of shorting 27 is going to be the ultimate doom here maybe not tomorrow this week or next however soon
citron employees stop the steal lmfao
ok im hearing tesla folk are buying pushing the price they been in for a week or so look out put on your short shorts
why today is closed
this isnt about the money this is about killing the shoooorts
im not worried cause im long term on this but it really irks me that a stock like gme is up 22 because of memes and we get upgraded and cant get up 50 because the market decides to have one of its few red days
its coming
more short squeeze unbelievable i dont have a position but i will consider it loll
not a single one of his 5 things are a reason to sell gme lol moron left
 sold at 6375 put  into trxc and rmonext short squeeze buy gme at 35 run up 2 will come a few weeks after
past 30 push alll in
i think andrew has moved on to macys
due to unprecedented short this stock can go as high as 9x from now i’m taking that bet 
time for a put 
i think some bigtime traders and investors will ride the wave monday they are smart enough to recognize the upside on a short squeeze is gigantic
keep holding until above 100 sell for profit and keep the rest even if there is a fall off eventually it will happen over multiple days and you will have multiple chances for exit points above where anyone with paper hands will hold and sell at there are built in breakers that stop a stock from falling too much in one day but not rise this will be like vw and get into the hundreds before a correction still x24 what we are at now

gme will hit 300 this weej
this squeeze will be included in the history books d
this stock is easily 10x more valuable so at current pricing of bout 4142 i’d say it should be   420  at which point walmart or amazon can take it into their hands
what happened
crazy movement from gme gamestop today started at 20 high at 38 closed at 31 over 57 percent at closed gamestop added more board members doing a lot better in online sales lots of hype here and low float there’s only 50 million shares in the float supply of 50 million shares there were a 143 million shares traded today so this was a lot of bulls buying in for hype and lots of demand so obviously it exploded lot of momentum stock but high risk i can see it going up in the future but short term could pop 2008 was priced at 60 2016 was priced at 50 per share currently at 30 gamestop was really close to becoming bankrupt and closing but i don’t know news on that right now nearing six billion in annual sales and new management in place for digital market short interest is higher than the number of shares outstanding this is an usually situation that will likely drive the price much higher if a random ev stock with no short interest and no revenue can triple in a few days why can’t w company with historic short interest and 6 billion in revenue be on the look out just giving you my watch for tom may or may not buy tomthere’s a lot of bears buying options on here and tryna short there is so much money being thrown in here it’s unbelievable over nine hundred billion dollars lost over in bets that stock will go down today because the stock gained so much there is drive in this stock and i won’t be surprised if it hits 50 by end of month could play out like tesla could not saying it will beware this is a wall street bet stock too so they’re going crazy
150 short an no way to cover this will be a rerun of tilray going over 300 before the gasp from the shorts
everyone go read seekingalphas new article about gamestop and ryan cohen
why is this at 100 lmaoooo

negative articles all coming out lol get rekt bears
50 todayseparately gamestop said that for the nineweek holiday season ended jan 2 comparablestore sales rose 48 and ecommerce sales quadrupledworldwide sales eased 31 to 177 billion due to an 11 decrease in the companys store base in the perioddemand for the new generation of consoles remains very strong and as a result we anticipate the consumer’s excitement for the new console technology will benefit us going forward well through 2021 gamestop chief executive george sherman said in a statement

the fact that shorts genuinely want this stock to go to 0 is pretty disgusting whoever you are sure you might have a different view on the future of this stock and the company thats completely fine but wanting the company to die destroying thousands of lives who work there for your own financial gain is shameful have some class
i just hit 1000000 cant believe it

cohen essentially bought a name that people are familiar with and i guess that’s why people are investing in this company so outside of a name what else can gme offer
we will see 90 today don’t bet against us
so if this absolutely explodes like tilray short squeeze explodes if there are shares available to short would it be smart to short this at 100 a share or something like that or would interest rates be too high

poor little andrew my wife left bails at the last second acting like he just found out about the inauguration and wants to maintain the moral high ground by cancelling his stream andrew and his followers are at the bottom of the male hierarchy and will always remain there
i love all of the paid bashers and new shorts coming down on this board to try and drag us all down gme longs who held no matter what theyre not making money we are we are familiar with gme they arent cope harder because this thing is going to 100 once all of these shorts get squeezed
just before the close on friday i bought gme feb 26 20 puts i expect these options to become a 10 bagger
if you are a gme shareholder do not sell tomorrow no matter how high it goes it can go so much higher do not sell your shares you will only be helping the shorts to cover
this is a popular stock now like plug it will not stop going up
remember everyone who owns shares to put a sell limit at something fictional like 100 a share that way shorts cannot use your shares

love from palantir you guys  to 100 rejoice citron has fallen
ez long hold remember every day they try and shake us out time and diamond hands will reward us
forget about fundamental values until this epic short squeeze plays itself out the share price will way overshoot anything that seems sensible we are entering the early to mid stage where the vast majority of shorts are apanicking and fearful of endless losses collectively the shorts lost well over another half billion dollars just today on top of huge losses sustained over the past six months manymost of them are rapidly approaching margin calls when that happens they only have two choices immediately post more money or the brokerage firm will issue a market buy order to close their position regardless of share price most likely the top peak of the squeeze wont happen until you witness a truly parabolic explosion id expect a 100 single day gain as we approach the peak today were not even remotely close to that since im like a shark who smells blood i added even more shares today regardless its virtually impossible to bullseye pick a top but with the incredible short interest percentage of about 140 of float the skys the limit this is a great opportunity for all longs

again i will say if cathy wood says she is buying gme the price doubles in an afternoon let that sink in shortst
if cohen take over this can easily get to a market cap between 510b in 23y time it can definitely reach those levels just with the short squeeze but whoever is willing to hold long term theres real value and prospects going forward
who is holding short over night hahaha good luck with that
short are desperate there interest rates on the borrowed shares are going sky high and the stock is just consolidating its gains waiting for the next move up has anyone really talked about what happens when 200 plus billion in stimulus floods the market here soon do you really think some of these people are not going to buy gme with every cent  its just a matter of time at this point  every day that goes by and this is still holding strong the interest weighs on the borrowed shares some shorts are so underwater what happens when a big fund goes  you know maybe its time to reevaluate our position what happens when you have so many shorts all trying to squeeze through the door at the same time its coming and its not a matter of if its just of matter of when
margin calls kicking in hopefully it lasts another week to drive us to 50

something bigger is brewing this isnt the top
volume is way down today a sign that earnings news will create extreme volatility either the bulls win big and bears lose or the other way around seems evenly split to me at this point and could go either way good luck to all
bye bye shorts again you cant have my shares for cheap
did stock freeze at 8809
gamestop isnt a real company its just blockbuster in disguise has anyone here even seen a gamestop before ive literally only read about them in stories
i think i understand ryan cohen pushed the reset button on the nyse gaming console and after purchasing a copy of the game genie inserted it into a high speed trading machine inputted the appropriate cheat codes and a way we go gamestop is transforming stock market investing into a video game gamestop once conaidered dead but in video games you insert a few quarters and you get to continue

ive spent the last hour or so laughing at shorts now excuse me as i go buy another 500 shares  third time buying today have faith stay the course its small guys vs big guys right now and the small guys are winning by a mile
gme on the yahoo finance board looks like a blinking christmas tree
you all realize that for the price to continue to rise you need more money to buy the same number of shares right
see how that 15 drop is going away these shorts dont know what to do
disgusting so i checked out the wallstreetbets board getting all the press regarding gme and could not believe how disgusting it is a mob trying to kill the manipulative short sellers all oblivious to the fact that they are a power drunk greedy manipulative mob themselves becoming what they say they hate they say horrible things about short selling which is absolutely necessary for liquid and orderly markets if market makers cant hedge then they arent going to make markets and give the liquidity that we all love the board bashes old people as if they will never get old and are generally incredibly rude and arrogant all while acting like they are doing the world a favor when they really just want a new iphone porsche house or whatever i get it shorts are losing bad but when this turns and it will there are going to be a lot of longs feeling unrecoverable pain buying the dip or averaging in on far otm calls is a great strategy for getting rich until one day it doesnt work and a months worth of gains gets wiped out enough of my rant good luck longs and shorts be careful and try to consider acting like decent human beings
hold the line sell  400

wow 80 short borrowing costs that is 1 every three days msun so 10 in one monthcnbc the prostitutes of the media are bashing and so are other media outlets like cramer you remember cramer and the other hedge fund mouth pieces telling you tesla was  and to run away when it was 150 per share presplit ie you could have been up 21 times on your money tesla was heavily shorted also but no where near as much as gme watch number of planted stories posted to scare off the suckers get more frequent as the hedge funds who shorted this company get more desperate how would you like to short 36 million shares and watch this thing jump another 10 per share of 360000000 of pain for the shorts and the short squeeze top could be over 100 per share
stocks are crazy market crash is imminent
did we just break resistance

keep holding longs we are going much higher than this let’s take our stand together 
please clarify as was reported recently ryan cohen increased his stake in gme to about 13 just yesterday a barrons article mentions mr cohen buying more shares does anyone know if the barrons article references his last weeks purchases or is he continuing to buy more shares beyond the 13 stake thank you for the information

i suspect that the sec will get wsb shutdown soon after some big shorts probably got ruined today
by the way next friday’s 50 strike call options are trading for over 200 that is crazy
bulls really out here trying to force margins and add 25b to market cap if you are a short just cover and fight another day fighting a losing battle from what i see holy
theres negative float in this stock and 7000 shares left to shortwe wont  but we will be at the edge of the universe
50 by end of day
yall better sell when market opens
probably a decent percentage of the wsb crowd held on to their itm long calls and will be assigned shares they cant afford to buy and will need to liquidate first thing on monday question is will the fomo crowd buy their shares in enough quantities or not its anyones guess
suicide hotlines will be flooded with shorts next week
i dont have a position in gme at all regrettably but i had to jump into the board here and say a sincere thanks to all gme stock holders for what has been the absolute most entertaining short squeeze ive seen in years lolyou folks rock and glad youre getting rich
buy the tlry dip because its going to pump like gme this year with legalization
the question is with nearly 200m share volume today how many shorts are left a good percentage covered but could there still be 40m left to cover
back to 4just a matter of time this spike will be viewed only as noiselol
just curious has anyone here bought something at a gamestop store over the last year or two

shorts wont win 
how can it still drop day traders selling profits while shorts holding breath for opportunities
hilarious this is a perfect example of why stocks should be shorted some say the short covering will make it go higher those people are the ones that eventually lose money because their timing is off hint covering is what is making it go up now the business is basically like radio shack and will slowly die no profit no growth
 power to the people
nothing to see herenormal market behaviorcough coughvaluation porn
everything is down look at the nasdaq dow 30 something happened

desperate people do desperate things i would expect some sort of short bashing article to break soon driving the price down for half a day then off to new highs just looking at what is possible shorts are almost trapped but not quite yet look for a few more trickst

gamestop got new ps5 and xbox stock it’s already sold out in less than a minute only only they’re trying to boost ecommerce
if you didnt buy in before 20 just sell now and enjoy your profits this stock will not sustain for the long term it is a failing business in a landscape where the latest console from sony has a version that is digital only imagine being gamestop when microsoft sony and nintendo only have digital consoles once this hype dies from the memes and cohen getting invested this will crash and burn as it should
back to 41 and no shares left to short lets goooo
a lot of people getting burned right now when something seem to good to be true it usually is
bear attack to keep the 115 calls otm just hold everyone
we broke 40 poor andrew

dont listen to these bots and weak hands if we hold above 60 next week is going to be wild
we are making history the biggest short squeeze ever target 1000 over 100 of the float is short insane
where do you think the short percentage comes from market makers you as retail investor is going to loose there is no short squeeze who do you think moved the price action over 15 million shares in last 5 min trading people on this message board its a classic pump and dump and everyone who thinks the hedge funds lost money whewwww well keep buying

somehow this stock is holding on going into a weekend wild stuff
i keep thinking ive missed the train and it keeps going higher so if i buy today finally and it tanks you will all know im responsible for it 
i am not invested here neither long or short and i also have zero clue about gameshopnevertheless i find it just wonderful that the criminals citron and his lefty boss get completely destroyed he and his followers did not deerve it any better i hope it doubles again today  although i thing citron is already dead
end 50
regardless of numbers everyone hates gamestop it has been that way for years they lost consumer trust with shady practices and that to me is their biggest downfall ecommerce is where they can shine but honestly i cant tell you the last time i heard someone say they ordered something online from gamestop
lol to ppl buying puts this is not going down to the path of a 
where my boys at 
not good freaking halt my call is going to plummet
102 oh my lord let go guys
lol its days like this that make everyone feel good even those not in this stock
1000 is not a meme just hold and wait for it
you guys do realize that once all the discord group is unable to keep the price propped up it will fall faster than gravity because there will be no buyers left the short squeeze you are waiting for is a mirage just saying
wondering if i should use my call profits to buy puts eventually got to make money on both ends of the trades shorts still need to be squeezed though so no puts yet just riding the calls i have haha
no matter what happens the bear thesis is dead the shorts will eventually have to cover gme is not going bankrupt and ryan cohen will most definitely turn around the company considering he turned a 100k investment into a 43b dollar empire competing headon with amazon petsmart and petco
the hedges want us to fail they want us to be afraid they want to continue  the working class foreverare you gonna let some numbers on your screen shake you are you gonna ignore the fact that were still up 50 today
eastman kodak 2
can anyone buy gme stock or do you have to be an antifa member
in 3 days gme went to 13 from high of19 inspite of much much better q3 earnings sales are down for all retailers including m kss bbby gps  all because of pandemic and stores not being open full time so why gme is panalized bbbylb wsm gps are all doing fine with lower sales numbers eventually gme is going more and more digital as much as 6070 and closing 1000s of stores and the company may be acquired or stay strong independentjust saying
if everyone that is holding shares puts a limit sell on them it will cause the squeeze to really be felt in this case i would only do 5000 more than the current price and just cancel and reset the sell as it gets close to it if you set you sell at say 200 they will still be loaned out to shorts because the odds are slim of it reaching that in a day at its current price level who is with me on initiating a squeeze
easiest money buying puts coming up 
wow we got green again
acting good gme after the dip
this company only went up on a technical short squeeze actually gamma squeeze just wondering for the longs here what is cohens pivot plan because i cant find it

after hours shorts get creamed
for the company to be worth 50 a share it would have to quickly double their growth pachter who has a 16 price target which is the second highest among analyst tracked by bloomberg continued in order to give gamestop credit for higher earnings power pachter who rates the stock at neutral wants to see cohen’s strategy
lemon man listen to this sour  about short termbulls nah and we dont care we are longryan cohen i havent even announced my plan yet

you know whats hilarious the shorts think they are going to win here wallstreetbets keeps on buying shares in gme many on margin because they are all crazy degenrate gamblers you think melvin capital and a few other big money names can keep up with this sheer amount of retail purchasing those days are over for gme i am holding 3k shares at around 14 check my profile history do the shorts know how many people just from wsb are holding shares last i checked it was close to 15 of the floatand these crazy gamblers keep buying more in short bears are ed

so here at 12 where are all the bag holders bragging last week about buying more at 1314 joe hockey vy cj ammar there is zero catalyst until they report holiday sales in five weeks only problem is they already guided with reporting a 16 november comp and positive quarterly eps and it still went down how they gonna beat that guidance with being sold out of new consoles as of november the only thing that keeps this from a 1011 handle is another cohen pump
the higher the price is the more money you need to move the stock higherhow much extra cash you all got

i have no gme stocks i just came to see dead shorts
looks like a bunch of insider sells recently in the sec reporting i think the insiders know its been overhyped or that they might be a new stock offering and take advantage of the high share price to sell more shares
halting happens when the exchanges see extreme volatile moves up or down so they let the transactions settle down equally and then let them trade again this is going back up soon boys and girls
1000 options will skyrocket

how can u short a stock with solid future guidance
to all newcomers who have no idea what this stock is reading about pump and dump etc i suggest you look up what a short squeeze is do not think this will be an easy short it is extremely dangerous to short this stock at this time if you can even find shares to borrow do your due diligence remember a long can only lose as much as they put in while a short can keep losing money as long as the stock moves up
stocks are becoming a casino i’m 100 cash at the moment waiting for a pop on the market not pop up but bubble pop

up huge in after hours i cant find any fresh news is there any catalyst or are some folks feeling the squeeze
when you short a stock in a bull market there is a 95 chance you are going to get run over by a short squeeze
must be bear season all these bears on here came out of nowhere hold the line
why is this so quiet if an epic squeeze is impending
wheres ryan cohen
going back up cant wait for the next halt in 10 minutes
gamestop was the next nio lol
just a small tidbit of insight gamestop has these sponsored products on their site i am familiar with online retail and sponsored products like this have the potential to bring in a ton of money definitely something that is a cash cow they are just starting it and probably have people that are roadmapping a strategy to make it better and bigger
false information is spreading that the ceo sold 50 of his sharesthat was not the effing ceo get your facts straight it was hestia selling shares and who can blame them just hold your position desinformation is strong today trying to force a downward trend
so many sour grapes here probably bought at 47 and bleeding badly now everyone is a trading genius during a bull run hahaha
cramer and faberer on cnbc are actually saying that the shorts cannot cover this is going much higher they are not pushing it but realize this is not over
please let this stock halt and open at 30  would make sense and really make the story even better
u guys do understand the negative price action is all happening during after hours rightthe only time stock prices can be manipulated the most
this is going to make cohen the richest man in the world

bb it’s going up monday guys
i wish motley fool would just find successful investments and leave out their opinions of other investments
team work from all around the globe hi from greece long and strong
they arent going to live stream they used yesterday to make a quick buck and get out shorts are dead
they are trying to bring it down but in the end they will fail too many shares short to make a orderly escape i would not want to hold short over the weekend also the rate in december to borrow shares was 14 on average now its 42
 gme going back down 
i just bought more right at 359 monday is going to be awesome
it’s madness madness
just hold your shares
the biggest game company in the world not worth 4b but worth 40b
longs sure get upset when challenged in the middle of a pump parade dont worry nothing said here makes any difference the stock will naturally collapse in on itself citron is not needed so do not blame them gamestop like radio shake and blockbuster will not be missed only forgotten
hey shortyeah you
wow i love a good shorts bbq
1730 et short squeeze
it’s funny how people chase garbage stocks like this i would not pay to short this but looking out 23 months at puts could prove to be quite profitable if it does run up much more might be time to pull the trigger
nothing to see here
buying calls soon as it opens
question how can there be a higher percentage of shares short than are available for trading makes no sense to me gme coming back down right now wonder if there will be another big move up this week
i bought a ton of 25 puts for 15 centsim getting ready to get paid like a champalso apt is shorted worse than this stock and it makes moneywatch out for apt squeeze
the only thing going down is shorters losing it all
1500 thx everyone
oh the humanity
this wasnt even the squeeze ladies and gentelmen this was related to the 60 calls expiring today the margin calls havent even started prepare for triple digits next week start moving your cash and buying more shares
have you noticed volumes are extremely low yesterday and today for earnings date and day afterwhy maybe shorts actually know better than to short more not many shares left to short the big players didnt fight it because they wanted the price to go down temporarily big  instutions rc mb etcmaybe all of the above key points from earnings  all bullish no forecast will report dec in early jan dec will be profitable and  comps they expect the console effect to last all 2021 extreme growth in online business not just a high  in growth but  of total salesthoughts
the media is in bed with the hedge funds that are short af no amount of articles can save the shorts sorry retail got this one right enjoy the squeeze
down 40 points in about 10 seconds lol
hehe people dont understand how controlled shorting is done if you think that they are flat short you better think twice smart shorters are buying insurances otm calls to cover their maximum loss now they are flat you are long long on a stock where the industry is going the other direction cloudgaming where you wont need a gamestore in the meantime insiders are selling their shares i hope that everyone can get out as soon as possible
shorts remember following sentence it may help yougme can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
from now citron articles mean load up
4000 price target hahaha what a joke gamestops business model is moral garbage these snakes pay 75 for a perfectly good used xbox one then turn around and sell it for nearly full price and they only check to make sure it turns on they dont make sure it actually works my local is gamestop is always deserted i havent been there in years eitheri feel really bad for whoever buys now because they are going to get burned so bad dont fall for it this company has been dying for a decade
jan 15 tomorrow haha im loving this
there are two main reasons why i refuse to sell out here even though my shares are up a lot the first is i believe the fundamentals of the business are really going to change i believe in a new gaming platform followed by a turn around in bm with more towards pc and pc building grandma needs some memory for her laptop stop in and they will do it in a hourthe second part and probably why we are all here is the insane amount of short shares if even one fund capitulates the whole series will come unglued imagine how this will spill into their other positions inside the fund really we might be right around the mother of all short squeezes here it might even serve a lesson later on why you dont over short a stock at 140 of the float this could have all been prevented if the funds started covering at 34 a share and instead were so greedy they wanted to bring it downwhen all these posters start screaming valuation and pigs gets slaughtered just remember they are the ones that went all in short they were really the greedy ones and any bubble they create they did so on their own
people are getting bored now the stock is dead money and nobody wants to hold this because its peaked zzz bye
the trading212 broker is down rn in the uk atleast
ev world changed by elon musk game world will change ryan cohen
well it looks like cohens buying is done since he is taking a seat on the board what are his restrictions on buying at this point
it’s simple if people think it will hit 100 420 or even 1000 why didn’t it hit that friday when it had that insane run upit dropped right away on the circuit breaker 15 in a matter of seconds and is down after hoursi’m not holding anything but if your gullible enough to buy shares monday you’ll just be buying from those who bought at the top they know the jig is up
get in now before the real launch on monday  
you just cant lose by shorting who cares if it pops some more in short term ultimately its going back down to 20 in coming days and weeks
how come it went up so much today im in the dark
back to 40 monday
quiz time if gme had enough cash on hand to prematurely pay off debt combined with buying back a substantial number of shares why would they want a shelf offering for additional shares yet they dont sell more shares now the only reasonable answer is that they anticipate the likelihood of much higher share in the future after a short squeeze and they might have long range expansion plans to challenge amazon a cohen plan
i wish i shorted at 160 instead of 125 o well gains are gains who’s holding my small 100 share bag
once citron and melvin finish pushing all their short positions onto retail shorts then the squeeze will happen retail shorts dont have the resolve nor pockets the big guys do and the rush out the door will be explosive
step 1 buystep 2 forget that you bought and dont look at the stock pricestep 3 look at your trading account in 6 monthsstep 4 take huge profit
shorts will close in the new year but not before eoy because they don’t want those realized losses on the books for 2020 they want time to make up for it in 2021 2021 gonna be a crazy year for gme only a 15b valuation on a company that does 5b of revenue in a pandemic and north of 9b pre pandemic come on baby  to the moon
wsb sent me 
soo are we holding till 42069 d
shorts get margin call they will buy back at whatever price longs dictate

moon today see u later
129 calls or further out what’s the best strategy
remember if you are up 100 and you sell half your shares you get all your money back and still have half your shares this is how you make money just saying
no one will ever believe left ever again
retail shorts left holding the bag for institutions
they have limited posts on this per account the bulls are still here they are just trying to hold us down
a reason why you don’t make it public that you are shorting a stock like andrew left from citron did with gamestop probably someone very wealthy who dislikes andrew left is buying up the shares hand over fist and forcing left to cover his short or risk unlimited losses maybe it is elon musk who doesn’t like short sellers very much
everyone do yourself a favor and google gamestop stock and take a look at the max graph that google shows guys this is an easy short
this will just blow tomorrow
we are nearing the end to the battle of the shorts shorts who listened to me thank you those who are still shorting i tried to tell you april we werent ready now we are
we are going back up soon hold
again don’t be surprised if we lose 40 by eod these guys have millions on the line hold and chill
fill this and callout citron for manipulating the stock that’s illegal as f httpswwwsecgovwhistleblowersubmitatip

dont challenge my target its heading to 59 and then some
outlook over the coming daysexpect yet another highly volatile dayweek on the market be careful with options at the moment shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause morethere is no doubt that the potential for another squeeze exists maybe even a legendary moasseven if the squeeze does not happen for whatever reasons this stock is an absolute value buy as many people before me have explained here another reason to go with shares rather than options
first time i’ve seen a company be up 100 and finish red
gamestop going outta business eventually that’s all i care about people will make money people will lose money and gamestop is ultimately doomed undeniable facts

the great investment guru warren buffett says be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful well gamestop shorts are definitely very fearful so this is the time for all longs to be greedy

because of the rare massive short interest on gme this is a rare position where the higher the stock goes the safer it actually becomes

this stock is so confusing can someone explain all this upside the past few weeks
as a share holder of a biotech cydy i would personally like to thank gamestop investors for putting the screws to “citron” a shorting company they have been manipulating a company that is putting forth a covid 19 therapeutic that has a very good chance at helping resolve the pandemic they have driven the stock price down from 10 to 2 the sp is currently around 5 this imho has delayed this drug from helping to save lives
gevo  news today at 3 pm deal with tesla apple etc this company has been going vertical in a big way a premarket huge can’t wait to hear what the news is later today their short percent is 15 so there could be some short covering at gevo as well￼

i remember the last time wallstreetbets said to have “diamond hands” march of 2020 when everyone bought puts and made insane amounts of money but instead of selling like smart people those morons decided to have “diamond hands” and 90 of them proceeded to lose everything once the market started recovering same thing will happen here and it’s gonna be hilarious
cnbc just released a video about top 3 stocks to buy in 2021 gme was one of them who’s ready to go to the moon  bears are mad

common break through 41 from the top rope
omg pls tan come wave to the crowd
has anyone checked out gmes facebook page there are so many customer complaints about lost packages and no response from customer service there are no responses from gme on their posts a business that cares would at least have someone addressing these complaints on their fb page and not just ignore them

you all ready for gme to issue 25mm shares next week
bless father cohen
its friday if we keep the price high lots of margins will be forced causing a spike next week
here comes the drop
if you are not aware of what happened to left citron and the shorts on gamestop gme today you need to check it out in august gme was at 5 today it closed above 65 after reaching almost 77 apparently robinhooders decimated leftcitron and the shorts ironically left said that they are investors who put safety and family first and when we believe this has been compromised it is our duty to walk away from a stock he is also reported to be turning people over to the fbi sec and other governmental agencies” talk about hutzpah how do you spell relief for these gme shorts bankruptcy maybe how to lose many multiples of what you invested is this what cydy shorts have coming one poster on gme suggested that they should go after citrons other short investments in other stocks
people that tell you not to sell is the guy that wanted to selll way before you be smart this stock price isnt rational
going down fast
etrade increased the margin requirement today i’m sure others followed took the wind out of it sails could get ugly at the close the puts are pricing in huge drop
now cdix is being bid upits for realcdix is uplifting to the nasdaq 7 million share float
he can’t even stream and we suppossed to take advice from citron  hahaha gme to the moon
i want us at 50 eod buy buy buy buy
wow didnt think that it would keep climbing for 2 consecutive days i didnt buy but good job for those that did take profits
last earnings report gme also tanked by a similar percentage if you look at the six month chart back then the stock took only a handful of days to recover before heading way higher deja vu all over again
most of the latest posts dont even get  most of us are already in longtimeso we sit easily working now and watch the waves take place the only thing you do  is increasing shorts  so please go ahead and gamble day after day in green that is what i see 
just like ktel in the 1990sbuy buy buysqueeze this stock
looks like 60 to me

yeha listen tona garbage company citron who shorted tesla at 180 lol
this might be historic
keep pushing buy the ask small increments
full on casino haha
this stock was last this high 5 years ago and 5 years ago was the last time i heard about gamestop
im gonna just say it this is the same price as activision blizzard in premarket sorry to be bearish but you seriously think this stock should be on par with a games company that has been going strong for years and declares a profityet this company still at a loss how are you going to make money other than by shorting and day trading too much hype
if i sell some jan 23 60 calls the break even price is 8925what is going on the market has gone insane
remember large short interest here so as with nio plug and other big winners you will start to see articles about valuation being too high overbought blah blah blah dont get scared out of a winner or sell a small piece if you believe the noise bottom line is a deep pocketed investor has acquired 9 and now 13 he is not selling and nor should you if you want to fully realize the results of your smart decision to buy this stock
gme sp all over went way over 20 and now under 194 glad i wrote a bunch of 22 and 2150 calls  just sayingholiday sales may be reported late today
banks have access to the data of sell limits so place them high it can effect whether or not they will short more shares on margin or not we broke the bank boys

i have 30 of my portfolio in gme puts thats huge my limit is usually 10 thats how confident i am
if executives were smart they would issuing shares
is the fee high to short the stock because lack of supply of stockman if we get some buyout rumor or takeover by microsoft things can get real interestingfrom my experience shorts do alot of research before they short u guys really think they on the wrong side
i am confused
how long will it be halted
hold this will go back up they are trying to scare you
loading
any predictions on when this gets back to 19

what market makers did to gamestop they also did to gilead check out the onemonth chartshorted to 52weeklows in december for nothing

for more profitable ideas like gmehttpstwittercombullinvestprstatus1348576374198571010
mute the shorts the bots and dont sell every share you sell is an opportunity for the shorts to cover and a bunch of profits you will miss out on
people who hold long calls will be forced to liquidate around 3 est because their positions are too big to exercise get out before then if youre long
gme has been a great teacher — 1 why you should never attempt to short stocks2 why you should never attempt to short squeeze stocks
battle royale
i love the way cohen tweets articles bashing gamestop shows he up for the challenge and very confident
so andrew and his shorts got soiled i love it
hopefully its not too late to get in sometime this week kinda fearful that i missed my opportunity
so many emotional people on this board when i’ve used facts and logic for my arguments got nothing but weak responses and people getting caught in their feelings i hope everyone holding is able to secure profits but i’ve learned the hard way to not be married to a stock gamestop is no exception not one legitimate argument
no shares to short at etrade
everyone set high sell orders to make sure the squeese happens
ouch i got whacked shorting congrats to the longs this one stings 
covering to commence after hours

to tmfzahmir  motley foolwho paid you for the hit piece on gmeto compare snowflake with a 90 billion market cap and no profits to compare with mstr at 6x sales and a 26 billion market cap to gme at 900 million market capthe motley fool certainly describes you clearlyno analysis of the gme holdings huge short positions no review of the pricetosales ratio 14 no review of the conference call last week no indication of an improved balance sheet sir are a paid hackthe only long way down is your supposed intelligence
yea shorts are winning so much they had to halt the trading lol
even when vanderbilt cornered the shorts in erie in 1855 he could only 30 cents on the dollar the attitude of a short even then was so sue me
the funny thing is the current management are all high fiving because they think they are doing something right theyll also get huge bonus payouts even though theyve accomplished nothing

volume still climbing going to 100  big shorts are about to feel the squeeeeeeze and this thing pops up
whats stopping institutions from realizing our insane si now and buying out the float for easy billions they ignored us because of the bear thesis sherman and bankruptcy but now with ryan on the board he is litterally a beacon screaming buy the sentiment is already changing just look at the wsj and forbes articles compared to the past poorly written barron and sa hit pieces the darling of wallstreet woke up a lot of big funds and are getting their people to do their homework on this stock right now only a matter of time before they see the insane si and decide to take advantage of it vw squeeze was because of porsche buying out most of the float we could see something bigger than vw

citron is most likely already out of their short positions once again leaving retail shorts to baghold
seriously what is very suspicious comes from the options market if april 30s are worth over 1 and 35 calls are priced nearly at least 075 and thats farther than double the underlying priceso options are pricing in a huge upward possibility i dunno about short selling but when the train wreak comes theres no time to escape
wait until earnings in a few months longs will crush it

longs pumping all day long and it did not hold 40 again i was hoping for 45 to add to my short i guess pumpers are not buyers above 40 and a 600 check only goes so far one headline and this thing dropped 10 in a hurry and then all the whining began i wonder what the pumpers reasons will be when below 30 the excuses will be comical but i am sure the shorts will be the main blame and not the performance of this nonprofit do not blame the shorts they have a legitimate case and longs only have a temporary technical squeeze
wish we could see a daily amount of shorts vs outstanding i believe there could be many days that it was over 100 with naked shorts
this could make a movie michael burry can star again big long
they would not announce sales for the holiday season if they did not know they were good gme is only required to report quarterly earnings announcements they knew the day they announced the 11 of january since date since they were 12 through the christmas season imo that is why the shorts tried to drive the stock as low as possible

old generations think this will be the same case as previous cases because its what they saw before and theyre tunnel visioned here are my opinions1 blockbuster is completely irrelevant when blockbuster was going away internet market wasnt as prominent as now they were already in a bad position due to walmart and amazon squeezing them in between while having movie rent as their main seller after decades they lacked a leader they didnt understand the market movement they didnt take the risk of pivoting into a new generation and they died off gamestop has a new leader old board sold their shares off they were doing just fine before the shorts started manipulating it with naked shorts and its got all the rooms for a perfect pivot cohen pulled it at the perfect time2 cohen and his crews they know better about the ecommerce market than anyone in the game at the moment amazon was a giant when chewy started yet they managed to compete and their work only grows stronger every year if you can name one group who could pull that off in the last 10 years please tell me because as far as im concerned no one pulled it like cohen hes about to do it again but in a bigger scale he now has money experience and more data3 its undervalued even without cohens uprise big companies have been pushing this stock down with manipulative tactics just because they sell brick and mortar this is literally all their argument and yet its an old news now they cant back off without a heavy loss and they will do anything to spread misinformation even further this generation is a lot smarter than the times when people stared at papers  tv and believed everything they spew out we can do our own research so easily now and its really not that hard to figure out whats really been stirring under its been proven with many many stocks in recent years the most prominent one is tsla this will not be an exception4 video game market its still being seen as a joke by old timers despite its exponential growth of market influence over the years they simply just dont want to admit it covid only made this easier people who didnt care much about computers now have highend computers now just look around you look how many people now owns a gaming pc since covid hit with evergrowing market like this there will be plenty of room for gamestop to squeeze in unless people just stops playing video game for this decade do you honestly think that will happen no

why’d yahoo take off the options info
the squeeze is coming really its already happened ya maroons
this will drop to 20 a share really really soon maybe even once the market is open it will drop sl fast that by the time you want to sell  trading will be haulted and your sell order will go through around 25 when actually it was supposed to be executed around 60
when do the shorts give up 25 30 35 when do they start to get margin calls and have to cover
that’s my response to all the weak arguments not shorting a thing lol not that these boards would influence a thing haha arguing the long term successfailure of a company while y’all are exposing the fact you bought stock hoping it’d keep going up but don’t really understand the company or the industry
lol this is amazing
wow gme at 2160 cant seem to be stopped anyone has latest news
squeeze me bby
shorts trying to scare us out just hold they need to buy shares at some point
this squeeze is not over our momentum was halted but there’s a huge amount of fuel out there big players are getting in on the long side shorts will get crushed more and more the longer this goes this will pop again the shorts can’t hold this long it’s costing them big money holding their short positions be patient longs we will be shooting up soon 
lol shorts right now
i love the new influx of bears keep selling
please stop pumping a bubble squeeze people will get srsly hurt buying this it will be 10 in a year
i original wanted to reply to a post from craig that indicated the share price of vw being lower post squeeze instead i’m using a new thread first it should be obvious if there is an infinity squeeze absolutely the price will be lower in the future after the squeeze any attempt to place future value on gme based on vw’s short squeeze in october 2008 is a false comparison us automakersf were bailed out except ford in dec 2008 the us bailout to chrysler and gm cost over 80 billion and lasted until dec 2014 net cost to taxpayers 10 billion that’s important because context matters vw was hurting as well fast forward vw had to take out a massive 20 billion euro loan to avoid bankruptcy in 2015 due to diesel gate i owned two of these cars going into the vw infinity squeeze everyone thought the short interest was only 128 however when porsche announced that they had bought shares and everyone realized that there was only 1 of the float left that’s when the squeeze took hold completely and utterly devastating the increase in stock price was market manipulation by porsche and the shorts ignorance porsche was behaving like a hedge fund they made 9 billion profit from the squeeze due to option and derivative trading the shorts lost 30 billion gamestop is turning the ship around and has the right captain at or near the helm rc there is currently a zero threat to bankruptcy whereas vw was a likely bankruptcy candidate in 2008 that’s my point this is where the comparison needs to stop gamestop’s squeeze may be different a parabolic squeeze can only happen when unexpected news hits the market for example porsche the announcement of rc as the ceo might do it this combined with the short interest for gamestop we will need a defining event catalyst to make an infinity squeeze happen i call it a unicorn event more than likely we will experience a slow build as shorts cover and take new positions and recover those new positions until they have been crushed this will likely last months this is a good thing look at tesla in 2020 at the end of the year many investors did not predict and missed the massive 700ish percent increase gamestop has been and will continue to be on an even higher trajectory than tesla with regards to your personal roi lastly everyone is expecting an infinity squeeze and it could happen however i doubt it i am prepared to profit if it does this is the problem markets react violently to unexpected news this is the worse kept secret ever as a side note guess who owns porsche today vw
its beyond short squeezethe shares have to be bought to cover the contracts that are outstandinglots of buys if its over 40 tomorrow on expiration
can riot and mara do this please
squeeze baby shorts starting to stain their shorts
i have doubled my portfolio in one week with gme the dreammaker

i shorted gme lost a little covered today and am out wish i had bought long because i would have made some coin either way my firm doesn’t have any shares to short citron probably grabbed what was left to short so if you do not sell you can win if you get nervous and sell they are going to destroy you
this is a war shorts lol
it should be 50 per share within this month that’s just a 10x price increase which would give it a mc of 3 billion if gme can reach to 3 billion this can easily achieve that my personal pt for this year is 200 per share if any of the japanese car manufacturer starts using their tech
holy manipulation
i bought heavy on margin and now need to sellforgot gme margin are strict

the share price has declined since the 7am traders hit the market so most likely the selloff will accelerate when the 8am traders come online by the time the regular session opens at 930am expect even more weakness
market buy market buy
if you short this eventually youll be right if you can withstand the margin calls
there will be multiple stops hold and ride this up  do not let people with information suede you away from that money hold
it feels like this stock is being held down it just gets pushed down and slowly inches up again
consolidation in the high 50s before breaking to new highs would be 
a trading halt happens when a stock goes up 10 percent in 5 minutes freezing the stock for two minutes it is automatic and not a person trying to screw any investor if this truly is going to be a violent squeeze that is going to happen a lot dont panic when the price freezes and comes back lower than you expected this will realistically take days to resolve and take us to the alpha centauri we could be looking at 2 hours in frozen time alone
shares hit highs of 130 premarket 100 gain wow
the market is only a bubble if you think about things like they were before retail investing millions of new dollars have entered the market because of accessibility not because of recklessness when things recover and all that money comes off the sidelines finally regardless of if youre in a game like gamestop or something more solid like apple this is not a market waiting for a crash this is a market with a bunch of new money in it and its also safer because thousands  millions of individuals will not move in congruence the way a few pricesetting funds will unless were trying to  ya
longs are likely to learn a hard lesson if they don’t take profits here but most won’t take profits it’s sad how they cycle is so predictable yet keeps happening i’m not short and don’t have puts both are too pricey which tell you the sentiment on this stock

does gme have online sales if theyve adapted and are no longer just brick and mortar then maybe there is more to this rally than just a short squeeze i simply dont know i am originally a bear on this name but that may change if some people on here can sell me the bull case if theyve adapted and joined the ecommerce world then this rally may be sustainable i welcome comments on here and look forward to them please tell me what i dont know generally a big rally like this doesnt come with zero catalysts in my 7 years as an investor
those shorts that went into a three day weekend feeling smug about their third or 4th time getting shellacked by this stock were probably saying ohh im shorting at 20 cant wait until monday you realize youll have to tell your family about the losses eventually
etrade wont let me short this
volym is slowly picking up lunch is over shorties

i have seen stocks go from 5 to 100 to 5 in 48 hours i will laugh if this closes at like 15 lol
told you guys this would squeeze up again yesterday and it wont stop either until around the 40s the reason why is because a large firm took up a short position a week ago and retail short investors are literally battling with the firm and they are seriously outnumbered thats why you dont retail short a power buy

there are 2 big options for tommorow first of all keeping any position open tonight it s a gamle the institutional players the wales get to choose wheather to cash out and take holders money or to buykeep and go all in on a last squeeze if u kept the money in this stock you gambled cashing out is without any risk while buying for a squeeze is a gamble and institutions do not always like to gamble the best option is by far to stay away and adapt tommorow after open
my 17s puts i sold are now half price whew thats funny theres still pricing for april 9 puts surprisingly why is 9 so expensive bum wonders
69 million out standing and 2733 insider owned leaves about 50 million float tutes own 85 million shares 66 million sold short  so their are 116 million out there total leaving around 30 mil trading

bullish af technical chartdont be scared by todays action u couldnt ask for a better looking chart leading up to pre earnings update info releaseu either have to have the vision to invest in a company like this or not think of it as looking at a run down house their is potential there and once that potential is maximized huge profits will follow
look at 60 call volume which is clearly saying opening over 80 i see it hitting 98
shorts lost 812 million today alone serves them right
i mean hypothetically they could be doing 10 bil with 2 bil in net income in a few years and all the sudden a pe of 10 would put them at 5x where they are now so i mean its not as crazy as other companies i see trading at 30x forward revenue
interesting time for this stock q4 seems poised to blow it out of the water new console cycle will provide favorable comps for the next 4 8 12 quarters or more this is the best chance imo for the shorts to cover if they cover they will need to drive up the price and then when gamestop prereleases q4 revenue figures in early january like the cfo mentioned on the call the stock will spike hard this could be 2025 by midjan
citron short squeeze
looks like qs pattern  watch it collapse in a week
in a few minutes httpsiimgurcom0g5sasnjpg
hold or buy
here we go ready for the push above 100
fraud unraveling
people trying to justify the valuation and further increases in stock price based on fundamentals at this point are crazy this is primarily due to short squeezewhich eventually will end and then the stock will collapse any ideas when this will be
the shorts are about to get decimatedto the moon
stocks cant go down with qe and free money
it was fun while it lasted glad i sold when i did
boys this was not the short squeeze this was an utistic gamma squeeze a few shorts covered due to margin calls but others stepped in and shorted again the shorts are truly retrded hold  buy monday or tuesday this stock will go to the  moon
furious covering is coming hold your shares expect to see a close around 65 no one wants to be short this going into monday where we will see 75
maybe mr cohen is keeping it above 20
ah preview of monday
ryan cohen we are waiting for your reaction
so is it true that the shorts have not covered and that the short squeeze has just begun
i’m going to dubble down on gme you guys decide how much every like is 20 shares good luck make me a fortune boys 
what happened to stock specific circuit breaker
cathie wood has a buy now on gme with a price target of 4000she had a price target on tsla a year ago and everyone laughed it’s well over that now no ones laughing anymore if she says gme is going to 4000 wall street will listen buckle up fir a wild ride boys and girlst
something to think about if the stimulus bill passes and everyone gets 600 checks that’s almost the exact cost of a ps5 and a 60 game with tax that would be huge for gme if only they weren’t sold out extra funny cuz last week gme presold their entire q1 console allotment so by the time consoles are back in stock in q2 those checks will have been long ago spent
50 today
you all didn’t want to believe iteven tried to coax us into selling but we all kept our diamond hands  good job bulls
people that are still holding do you really think taht this stock price should be at the same stock price when gme was a lot bigger and profitable with no competition from amazon and bestbuy this is pump and dump like the volkswagen short squeeze happen in the past after a huge surge stock goes back down to reality
poor reaction to the earnings call plus a pretty negative red day overall for the market makes this a pretty brutal day sold some 1250 puts expiring friday so either get a little premium or buy some cheaper shares come monday
what citron is doing should be illegal pure market manipulation
as you can see shares are running out paperhands are going out and their proportion is very low now only thing that can happen from here is shorts covering
im all in 115 55 calls bouta print
only up 15 come on now
is it wise to short this today noobiequestion
if it touches 101 graph shows breakout till 150
how can i short thishahhah sike to the moon
over the last hour some people have gone from broke to a millionaire to broke again
why would anyone buy this at this point
what about gme paying out a dividend if im not wrong short sellers have to contribute to the dividend if they own a short position and with about 100 shares shorted the dividend will be basically paid out completely by them maybe im missing something but could be an idea to finally get to an end of this crazy overshorted business
looking forward to short report in next couple of days
just double my position this stock will consoladite for a while then will hit 100 per share
starting to really hurt for shorts margin calls are happening as we speak hold your positions longs the shorts will no longer be able to defend their positions be patient margin calls will make them buy higher
i do like to see those that short the stock lose however i think the average retail investor is getting caught in the middle of this tug of war the expectation that gme will continue to go up as it has over the past few weeks is a trader mentality be careful
25 today
volume will be way over 100 mil lmaoin till the end
take profit and head for mara for shortsqueezebitcoin is heading for 150000 ethereum is heading for 10000 per thomas leeaave is heading for 3000 per jp morgan cryptocurrency analyst
where to see outstanding short volume daily 
any idea what kind of cooking oil gme is using to fry shorty
absolute chaos in the chat
good job y’all hold through the weekend for insane gains
this thing will drop like a rock today
this thing is going to rally and rally until next ermoses 2021
what do you think of jim cramers comment on twitter
sherman and management have something up their sleeve that is not obvious right now their persona on the call seemed a little too confident in their strategy and transition plan the idea of a potential dilution would not sit well with cohen and other large funds so they have to know not insider info something more than the average joe shareholder since the company was buying back why would they want to dilute themselves unless there is something bigger brewing maybe msft is involved in the future it all seems too strange right now i just hope that it opens a lot higher than after hours at 1406
wow the short supporters dont recognize they out themselves by commenting tens of times and feeling obligated to tag onto others comments to drag on them its so obvious dan michael etcor whatever million names youre using otherwise you said your piece you dont have any reason further to linger unless you have an agenda yall shorts gonna get burned and you know it youre just trying to talk up other plays to shift liquidity away bb pltr from fueling your demise the other plays can wait this has a crescent moon finish coming
here bear hear bear

todays gme stock chart brought to you by tropicana fresh squeezed
gamestop is up 2383 to 5328
get ready for a dip shorts went back up to 10000 from 5 httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme
guys besides a short squeeze what makes you think this stock that was about being delisted is now worth 65 or 100 its brick and mortar not for the covid this company would be gone read the boards when every one from a lyft driver to convince store person is buying get out trust me this is going to be bad on monday why do you think the price action was so fast and elevated 5 minutes before close run the price higher and dump its classic pump and dump the hedge funds are counting on your in experience look at volume this companies volume was up nearly 100 percent no one on this message as much as they like can manipulate as volume move when this volume drops you will be loosing your money get out take profits and move on
this trading is giving large investors time to accumulate once they achieve their goal they withdraw the ability to short their shares once that happens who knowsthe short ratio was 33 yesterday pull that out and see what happens
people are going to get greedy and lose out on everything these managed to squeeze out of this dead stock
wow shorts destroyed on gme
jeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sp well over 2 at 2245 whats happening or is it finally a short squeeze
gme has a new logo graphics and slogan on all of its socials now from linkedin to facebooknew slogan gamestop is the cultural hub that exists to unite the world of gamingsource httpswwwlinkedincomcompanygamestopdoes the slogan remind you of another slogan hint take a look at chwys slogan d definitely actions of a company thats about to roll over and die right rocket to the moon short squeeze to infinite and beyond
a year from now they gonna be making another movie once again starring christian bale as michael burry titlethe big squeeze
naked short selling gone wrong lol dont buy into this if you already missed the boat just my opinion congrats to those that bought 10
from 25 to 76 that is about 30xnot even tsla can match that
rsi 79 1 millon shares in 12 min
some  are selling hold dont you understand that this will be 200 when the shorts cover hold and buy
 wow bloodbath for shorts on rmo too awesome
omg i can only get so erect
hilarious that the short posters are trying to convince you that wsb took profits and left roflmao they dont know them very well do they
65 baby
time to move a bit to amc thanks gme
most of you bulls on gme after a 15x overall move and 50 one day move and 100 1 week move on no newsmost of your bull cases are simply wsb and reddit  robinhood have enough firepower and solidarity to beat anyone who is betting on the price going down into submission right because if you actually understood how the stock market worked these extreme technical theories about infinite gamma short squeezes etc have their limits they dont actually go to infinity and action on friday should be pretty clear to everyone that exceeding 76 again in any near term time frame is going to be incredibly difficult
what happen to buyers who get their shares from naked shorts that don’t deliver
game stop has a plan and obviously the numbers now show its working
welcome to the profit zone another big day not too late jump on board
all the shorts waiting for a dip this is it you dummies its going to hurt way more tomorrow
this is not the gme short squeeze everyone was or still is hoping for we might actually see a drop tomorrow and over the next week until we get some news shorts still havent covered yet so hold your position and keep them fried they cannot keep this up forever
i’m sure mr cohen did his homework before sinking 75m in gamestop now it is a matter of time before ifwhen he makes the big move
shorts what do i keep telling you should have listened to me on thursday if you havent covered yet then you deserve to lose money plain and simple

how many shares of the float are still short  i want to stay in till at least 70  are out  you read all kinds of things analysts saying it coming down  only thing i now  blue apron went 8 in a few days with a lot less shorters on it this year
for all who missed the fundamentals behind all of this this will summarize ithttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgzs5kgexqpcthis will fly to the moon shorties get squeezed they have to buy back shares
yesterday andrew left pretends to forget about the inauguration and cancels his stream today he pretends to get hacked no wonder his wife rip left this clown

this has to be criminal whats happening to all the most shorted stocks where the hell is the sec gamestop amc bbby plug etc etc etc all of the most shorted stocks are getting squeezed like never before this has to be a collaborated effort by a group of people that need to be outed you have major hedge funds loosing billions

the institutions dipped the markets to save their shorts they are market manipulators the sec will be getting on this
just sold my calls ive been holding stock  options on this thing since 11 but the goal is to make money right take some off the table folks and move on to the next trade
i will be glad to say goodbye to 2020 as its been a tough year for me when gme was in the 3s earlier this year i was feeling like i really knew what i was doing it was simple look at the 3 year chart and follow the herd valuation and market dynamics didnt matter i was shorting gme in the 3s and 4s while burry hestia and the insiders were buying i even said i knew more about retail and gme than they did then my god and lord trousers turned on me and sent me hardships regularly not only did i lose my entire investment account but i also got caught twice posting with aliases i copied from other investors to this day all i can do is pretend that none of it happened i also point out how much money longs left on the table after taking profits to deflect from my own bad trades sometimes this requires me to follow them to other boards which makes me feel just a little bit like a loser my resolution for next year is to learn more about how the market works and fundamental analysis i also will try to be less of a dbag to other investors who have taken my money and instead try to learn from them then maybe the hardships will stop being sentwhat else can i do
some of you are getting greedy if you’re financially free at this point why risk it
all jokes aside  kudos to the guys who had bought into this stock well before this surge

read this article about gamma squeeze if a lot of retail buyers buy 60c for jan 29 it creates an infintie gamma squeeze and retail could profit 100000httpswwwredditcomrinvestingcommentsl3e7g5gmeinfinitegammasqueezegapinoptionmarketutmsourceamputmmediumutmcontentpostbody
i went back long at 94 and have decided to stay long
the shorts are just desperate you can see all the posts all over these message boards just look at their post history and no previous posts on gme talking about need to dump their shares over valued blockbuster ect ect constantly giving price targets at 102030 all they are trying to do is get the weak hands to sell if you do sell at least realize these people are paid to post this junk also if you do sell and this starts rocketing and then you buy back in higher this market is not your cup of tea its all about the transfer of wealth from the inpatient to to patient
not stopping until 600share then it need more good news to continue
mr cohen purchased 500k at around 16 to my understanding that leads me to believe he feels comfortable with that pricethus the shorts have a limited downside to recover their losseswould you risk funds on a stock with down potential of 16 and an unlimited side of unlimited
it starts climbing loll u must be kidding me
wwwgmeddcomfor the bears
ok i bought my puts maybe i’m am flying to close to the sun and i’ll get burned but that the way it goes

dont worry its the future online casino
please explain how every single person in the developed world between the ages of 6 and 35 has been stuck at home playing video games since march how exactly does a video game retailer see sales decline 30 during that time literally rvery video hame company has seen a 2050 revenue increase this year and gmes sales collapse 30 how
that was a big jump in seconds was it shorts covering quickly or t
if this we close above 55 or so were in great shape i love this position
also i see a lot of posts about all time high it hit in 2008 and 2013 this is no where even close when they hit 60 twice back then the market cap was almost 10 billion because the amount of shares outstanding was over 200 million in order for this to get to the all time high it needs to hit north of 180 a share in addition i believe in the long term prospects of this ryan cohen is a genius and took chewy up against walmart amazon ect i believe his vision for gamestop is more like a epic games online with the stores selling electronics and all types of collectibles ect the brick and mortar presence will definitely get toned down but it will make it stronger in the end there are a few platforms to choose from like steam and epic but they can do better steam is good but their games are over priced compared to the market epic had a great campaign over the last few months but the choice is not great if they do a combination and undersell the games for just a few percentages they could establish a nice gamer base also do game give away like epic until the base is built up in addition you could also sell ps5 and xbox games where you would have a real leg above the 2 mentioned above with the deal with microsoft they could undercut the price by 23 for online codes to build a gamer base lastly lets talk about the shorts for a minute how do you have almost 3 million shares shorted more then are even issued how is this even legal  every few days they must slowly buy and sell to different accounts in order to do this creative synthetic position as i write this now i have never seen a stock shorted over the amount of shares outstanding and i have been trading since 1989 the shorts are so stuck in here its insane the price of a ticket to join in the fun as of this writing is only 3822 to participate in the fireworks i know i want to be in the biggest short squeeze ever if this falls apart then so be it as i wont risk more than i can afford to lose but i have a feeling this will be talked about for months
shorts you are warned hedge funds lose 30 billion on vw infinity squeeze
not selling until at least 100 even without a short squeeze float had shrunk from buybacks the past years so fair value is well above current price even after the run up this will be fun
another 100 is reasonable
keep buying  hold
another dip to add more shares  thank you 
ron has no credibility anymore this is a new market with new fundamentals the old school is just that old school i pray all the weak hands sell so more stronger hands can pickup at a discount and hold game over shorts i am coming for your money
let’s go longs hold your positions this is just the beginning it may take days or even weeks before we get to the peak just understand that we longs are in control and we can push the price up as much as we want to let’s work together to shoot it up to the moon 
for all the clueless people still saying blockbuster and brick and mortar retail i really recommend you go to rwallstreetbets and check out actual dd written on this most of the shorts i see on here are just completely clueless and clearly are just being tugged along by analysts writing obviously low detail hit pieces to sway public opinion to align with their own interests they keep repeating the same debunked claims like theyre somehow proof without bothering to look into the risky position they are taking citron and melvin will leave you high and dry once they get you to carry their bags for themyou can sort the subreddit by tag on the right side just click dd to filter out all the memes
bears are gunna try to convince you this is the end of the world we arent up 10 in 5 mins
im new here what does a pe of na mean earnings too high to calculate

guys guys we all know it’s going up
hold guys we are making history
all the bashers are out lol yea right fellas
congrats to all longs on gamestopgreat short squeeze another classic one being set up at michael’s mik craft storesamazing 33 of market cap is short do your own due diligence but in addition to massive short position that will need to cover 1 last 2 quarters over delivered and whisper is for a massive beat for q4 2 new management team and ceo executing well and focused on long term diy trends 3 could be acquisition for etsy or other 3 management announced share buybacks in last transcript 4 michael’s reporting massive sequential online growthwe’d love some additional help chasing away the shorts and making money while we do it hope you join our cause
this has all the trappings of shorts covering and then reentering a new short position when the price is driven higher it is the opposite of trying to catch a falling knife either way a knife will cut you if the shares shorted number roughly stays the same then this is helping to drive the price up great example of a snowball rolling uphill
gambling d
what is that smelloh look your shorts are burning
you aint seen nothing yet
there is no limit  1000 is entirely possible
cmon take this higher i wanna see 100 lol
could the shorts be waiting for takeover offer at a set price like 2025 per share rather than cause a short squeeze that might send the stock pass let’s say 40 they know they have a loss now they are trying to minimize it
up 108 ytd and people talking smack how they making money shorting it
get in now
new here do people actually believe there is still upside from 65 it was just at 19 a month ago what happened to change valuation so dramatically thanks
buy the dip my friends push these shorts clowns out
dont listen to the short spammers they clearly do not know what is going on gme to 1000
shorting is a dangerous game in a dangerous time
the truth is that hedge funds added to to cost average they will come out nicely
too many sell orders this might open up around 65 congratulations to everybody who took a dump over 90
the first 30 mins arethe hardest stay strong guys we will only suceed ifwe stand together everyone leaving the ship is harming us and themselves if people could just grasp this concept its not about fundamentals this is a game over supply and demand but what to expect of people that were taught to obey for decades onlythis is a once in a life time chance what are you waiting for 
this thing won’t hit 150 again
questioning how people can justify spending 90k on this stock this is a buy the rumour sell the news stock don’t get stuck holding the bag
no matter what halt they do we will still prevail
let’s go longs shorts have pushed gme stock down for so long i’ve been holding this stock for over a year it’s our time to get stupid rich hold your shares to the top short squeeze is here
citron and its followers are a joke
lol 
there are no more shares available to short through schwab or merrill this thing is deflating
citron cancelled the call lolol ol
this stock is so random hahaha
who keeps talking negatively about closing storesdo some research on lb which just closed half of their victoria secret stores  the stock is flying high cutting the fat  being profitable is what investors want which is what they are doing gme will be at an ath in 2021
900 end of week
this is pure short squeeze the fuse lit by some interest by the chewey guy and all the dynamite that already was there ie short interest pls stop w the prospects for their business model the company is figuring out an ecommerce strategy in 2021 lol who knows how long to get over this squeeze but yea its heading way lower
i think they are purposely pushing this down now to trigger halts
check aqms news guys
buy the 40 march 19 puts nobody is buying calls in march past 60 just remember fubo but this will be worse i will tell you so in a month
just bought more at dip price do while it ya can
this is insane i mean really
watching this from the sidelines this usually ends very badly for those that buy high with my experience if you made a lot of money on this capture the prophet if you’re going to take advantage of the short squeeze￼￼ you have to realize the game can’t last indefinitely good luck everyone
the game shall we say stops today
hold and wait for all these short sellers to get margin called over the weekend you can see they are in pain
hahahahahave fun paying for dept for the next 10 years shortstold ya
gamestop should raise money by stock issuance
game stop is not stopping
nothing has changed outlookwise since last week once weak hands are done exiting well be making new highs again
citron was right as long as there are enough shares to borrow no squezze the short interest has gone up even today
gamestop  blockbuster for video games
any other gaming stock recommendation guys
loo at all the shorts who came out of the woodwork every time this goes up they post frantically always new ones every night we are on the right path and you can just feel lie this dam of short sellers will capitulate
anyone has a link to the takeover
cut your losses now before the price hits the floor again dont want a repeat of kodak from 6 months ago
is this worth it im willing to yolo 5k into this
very surprised this didn’t crash today
longs dont lowball yourselves your shares are worth anywhere in between 5001000 in the case of a huge short squeeze hold your shares
good luck to all
lol at andrew left
share price will always follow the least resistance path which is up in case of gmewall street sharks wont spend millions to short the stock very difficult to lower the price and risking of being squeezedthey are more than happy to buy the stock knowing that it will trigger margin calls onshorts who will cover in much higher price
doyu will have a run
only the hold will benefit
remember that time when you learning about short selling stock and someone said you know theres no limit to potential losses on a short position
gme sp shot up to 1460 up over 5 great
if you sell for any less than 100 youre out of your mind this could easily see 200300 by the end of this
paper hands just sell your shares now so the  can ride this to the promised land
this will be 20 premarket tomorrow
they trolled us good though halting the stock at 69 three times good humor
so all the shares the mm have been forced to buy to cover the itm options you are all theorizing aboutwhat happens when the options expire and non of you can actually afford to take delivery on your options
come get ya some
this puppy is goin down hard monday too bad you missed out on the profits easy come easy go

shorts not giving and longs not giving i am long and not selling at this discounted price shorts are just gonna have to take the l
we need bb to rise too
let make history again
pretty interesting what a group of wild animals can do to a stock price but the circle jerk is dispersing
potential bulls looking for a confidence boosthint its not too late
do you all really believe big institutional money and hedge funds arent circling the water here looking to short shares to the squeeze shorts and sell you your calls at exhorbitant premiums those who were early will cut their losses but this is a 4b company there is plenty of money here at play to entice sharks to who can afford to swim in these waters
bye bye citron bye bye
here it goes buy more for the big push
sell
big boys want this down a market without shorters is not a market that would be the end of the usa
sell sell sell sell sell
dips for everyone

must be so scared to keep halting it they said it would never happen hahaha
to gme killingshorties warriors hunters great victory  andrew shortie got shocked to his coreyou have many more battles to fight many more wars to win theres a small israeli drug company named purple pharmaceutical symbol ppbt this company is developing two drugs nt219 and cm24 to treat cancer drugs resistant shorties are attacked the share daily and trash talk about the company and scientists who have been working to save humanityi am sincerely ask you please come to the stock and destroy all shorties to save humanity and better lives for the futuregod bless you and your families
close tomorrow 35 close friday 38 that is how it works sorry shorts i hope we get a chance to bury all those that shorted at 38 today
shall i short this  sike gme to the moon 
gme is up at 3320 in bad job market folks worst buy like tsla
oh my godshould i sell at 145
jesus what the hell last time i saw this stock was at at 17 and that was a few days ago what happen
24bn market cap imagine selling now
fasten your seatbelts

pretty sure citron had the opposite affect actually helping drive this up lol

gme spiking on the mexican exchange
so squeez is real huh
i see it hitting 190220
chick the shorts
got in for 1400 shares at 3675 and another 30k worth of february 19 45 calls lets get rich
short squeeze is starting and its every bit as glorious as i thought it would be
were strong our goals 50 within this friday and 100 within late february we can do it 
this is gonna end up badly for a lot of novice traders the wise ones have made a lot of money and some will still make a lot of money the rest will hit themselves in the head remember tlryphun and just a few weeks ago sigl
liquidity is scarce the shorts are fqcked calls will exercise at 40
wait for the margin call 1130 et and this will jump 100 today
top bullish charts  week 4 january 2021  httpschartanalysistoolsbullishcharts
will be passing 73 next on our way to 100
dont sell this will rocket
knew that would happen told my cousin to wait on shorting knew it would go down a little to lure in shorts then blow up again now is the time for puts
gme was 42 in 2015 so with this massive rollout of new gaming consoles 5000 is not unrealistic imo
this is exactly what happened in 2000 i remember it clearly 20 years old and thought i was a millionaire i had leverage my portfolio as much as possible on sycamore networks infoseek webvan kozmo etc etc etc i was just like these current bulls calling short sellers stupid simpletons as they did not have a clue just like you people from 1m in worth to 56k in less than 18 months gone just exactly like whats going to happen with gme and all these zombie companies that are worthless
ouch
dont sell until 10 000 hold hold hold
it’s all smoke and mirrors this stock is going to collapse hard i tried shorting but no short sales available
if you panicked and sold earlier today you may as well be a short seller if you want to join us again you will have to face punishment and buy back at a much higher price hold the line next time
pump till we win
shorts are trying to make a few pennies to make for the huge loss they have every short trying to convince us to sell since the price is holding at 60 still as far as i’m concerned i’m still way up on my position compare to this morning and significantly up from where i entered my position a few months ago i’m not losing money by holding shorts are losing a ton of cash by holding due to your interest who’s got the upper hand now this squeeze is not over since there’s still a whole bunch of shorts out there i wonder how horrible this battle will turn out for you shorts gme is shooting up and it’s inevitable no way for you to stop it hold your positions fellow longs we will win this battle weak hands should get out now unless you’re ready to grow soe balls
to the moon and back
is it monday yet 
if nobody ever sells i dont know how you cant win i have been around 15 years and never seen anything like this there are no shares to short so if everyone keeps buying it could easily go to 100 citron squeeze them until they cover
don’t worry not interested at this price
where all the bears at 132 premarket and its 440 am est only
the short squeeze is just getting started it can go on for days margin calls have not even been called yet don’t sell your positions yet more profits to come i see at least 100 in the next few days
according to td 140 of the shares are sold short remember to put in a sell order with a high price tag so that the shorties cant borrow your shares let the short squeeze begin woohoo
i hope 2021 is a bad year for you shorts yall kept talking all weekend now go to talk to the bill collector
melvin capital is about to get wiped out i can’t fathom losing 1 billion shorting games stop the sad thing is it’s other people’s money they’re losing and when they lose it all they will open a new fund
smallcap short squeeze in early00style
yall thought i was joking about that 3 hour long bull flag welcome to the thunderdome baby
ladies and gentleman we are about to witness the most epic week in bb history  i’m saying it opens 15 on monday and ends the week above 20 stay long and wait for the squeeze gme cciv bngo gevo
i think it will hold this time around
an offer now might hold down a squeeze let the stock run
they try to hold 40 at all costs even if it means buying more puts because they know thats the psychological limit where people see it as bullish
i love how literally everyone is bullish on here except stevo and hot chick
citron last seen floating out to sea on the hudson river
its funny that andrew is banned from hongkong trading for manipulation of stock prices 
omggggg my call option play lets gooooooooo
i love it wish i was party to this but this awesome to watch
continue holding the squeeze is nowhere the beginning with all the si we can get this to 400 on a huge short squeeze
whenever someone hears gamestop people have a reaction definetely not irrelevant
citron delayed the presentation today cause they are scaredand they got nothingamateur hourhahaha
sorry that’s lots of calls at 20
it’s ok if you didn’t sell it’s a good lesson for next time
no matter what happens it’s important to remember two key facts first 2020 has seen unprecedented growth in the video game sector literally every game developer and manufacturer has had record revenue increases this year second trousers bought this stock in 2017 at 2490 and sold it in august at 618 nothing that happens after 4pm can change those two facts
people you are in the hands of a man who turned chewy into what it is today i would not bet against this company shorts have to cover eventually

interactive broker says gamestop shares are trading higher as the stock continues to gain momentum amid strong retail investor interest lol
shorts getting desperate is pretty hilarious

did it just pause trading
if cyber monday was the biggest ever gamestop likely sold a bunch of visio tvs online does anyone know how much gamestop makes from each tv sold another decent revenue stream it seems
people are insanely going crazy for stocks such as game stop door dash air bnb netflix and so onthey will teach you guys a lesson soon dont go too far too fast there will be a big bump or pot hole down the road things never be the same history always repeats keep that fact in mindpump and dump
please clarify as we all know there are way more shares short than exist therefore if i along with a handful of holdouts refuse to sell even as margin calls force shorts to cover the price can theoretically go to infinity right unless mr cohen allows more shares to be issued the price must keep going up up and away hmm i like that but im not a greedy guy if the final desperate shorts want to buy my shares they may buy them for 1000000 per share good luck shorts go gamestop
1000 shares on margin
congratulations too everyone who made bank on this mega squeeze
resistance is at 36803720 it seems wonder how long itll hold
be carful  this is crazy and will hurt lots of peopleeven if it’s worth current or higher sp profit taking will creat another qs

gme shorts destroyedso why is acrx climbing quickly on record volume news leak on acrx
buy buy buy its a free discount
stevo comes and posts the same radioshack gif everyday to feel better about the fact he has been here saying its going to fall since 15 watching his net worth plummet on shorts

i am just here to see the rocket launch congrats
you shorts might be right gme could go bankrupt the problem is can you hold through a 500 loss and several years to get there
for the price appreciation to continue gme cohen needs to put some communications out on what strategic moves they are making in the marketplace regarding their strategy
why is it okay for them to halt trading on a stock that ensues a short squeeze isn’t that not a fair market those who ha do faith should be able to trade in these times anyone with trading experience understand how those trading halts work
well of course it’s under attack in ah there are 66 million shares shorted
the gaming business is bigger than all of hollywood and all of sports combined trade accordingly
now at 64  78 usd
this is the mother of all short squeezes ive never seen anything like it
bahahahahahaha
f ing citron again and again the same story you are going to loose this time shorties
hold 100 till the opening bell
the memes tonight will be something else lol
5 more minutes cannot wait lets do it again lets go to the moon
left made his reputation with his massively successful short on valeant pharmaceuticals where he had discovered that their bookkeeping was a fiction but it seemed to me that he had gathered a wolfpack who were tipped to his next short target and built a short position ahead of his public announcement i always wondered why some of the major holders didnt fight back if i recall bill ackman lost about a billion dollars on the valeant selloff well finally he ran into a buzzsaw where the entire float has been bought up and he and his wolfpack are trapped in the process the stock has been radically mispriced if i were long this i wouldnt wait around too long before taking profits
gamma squeeze incoming if it holds 115 160 is next target
im all in gme but the sentiment seems to be too bullish again 
shorts trying to cover dont give away anything
all you boomers don’t understand
rsi 8829overbought

great company

bears be all dumping soonand every time stock goes up another 10
wow they are purposely halting it now
shorts getting destroyed worse than tesla

who just bought over 40 good griefuse a financial advisor
collapse will be epic but first shorts will pay
many people here learned a very expensive lesson
ding ding ding 4618 trousers is officially a failure with his selling 3500 shares at 618 in sept jk he’s always been a failure eat it trousers oh trousers look who owns you now every single gme shareholder roast
this is itt 
there will be a day that the shorts will be so overwhelmed that they will not be able to stop the rise i just wished the knew what day that will beknew
all citron could say is it is going to 20 buck lol loosers cant even get a web cam to work these jokers
falling knife soon
i guess it boils down to whether you believe ryan cohens capabilities as a turn around specialist or if citron can counter with justifiable fact i know who i am betting on
do not sell if we get haulers again we resume monday buying more on every dip
up160 in premarket wow short squeeze 20 on the way
if you look at a long range chart gme has a history of shareholders cashing out and the stock taking a nose dive when they bailout i waited years to get out at 4474 long term gme may be ok but i was tired of having that much money tied up with no dividends that long that is my take i am glad to see shorts get hammered for a change so i wish you all best of luck
wow to anyone who go in early well done my hats off to you
do people not remember yesterday open dipped too 
if you missed gme the next runner is nok bb amc and pltr
macd plummeted and rsi low big reversal coming
this stock will mark the history of wall street will make such a big growth that it will be talked about for months to come it is just a question of whether you are ready to make money and for  10000 per share be prepared today i am adding another 400 stocks god bless you 
melvin captital and citron will fall a new age has come for gamestop
how much more can people pump this stock before it collapses lol
cant short no options available
short average 4327 feeling darn good no plans to cover until mid to low 20s citron negativity will be relentless until it sees 20 the citron announcement alone took the stock down 10 in minutes not a stable stock nor company if this closes red the hyping long party is over
the shorts are chatting in mass here i smell fear
lot of short interest on this board today lmao
gameover
why are there long term investors in this everything is moving to digital the playstation store can sell their own games digitally and also the xbox store

fidelity just increased margin requirements to 95 on gme despite the market being closed
i closed my long at 116 pre market this went to 135 and now down to 89 just insane
sp tanking nowdown 2 and shorts in control hope it stays above 19 cohen needs to be active and move fast
how many of you guys are actually buying shares right now vs just waiting for the share price to pop again if it’s the ladder you all may be in some trouble
wedbush analyst michael pachter believes that “gamestop is wellpositioned to be a primary beneficiary of the new console launches and we remain quite optimistic that it will return to profitability by fy21”however for now pachter reiterated a hold rating on the stock with a 16 price target as he argues that the “global pandemic remains a hurdle and we expect it to remain a hurdle until the majority of gamestop’s addressable market is vaccinated”“we have a positive bias and we think the company is positioned to generate solid profits in 2021 and beyond but until we have greater visibility we are unprepared to upgrade” the analyst summed up
its fine old people time for you to give me your money 
god these halts
either we are all rich in a week or 2 or all of us are dying broke
stop buying and selling smh we need yo hold to get the squeeze smh
nothing as really change accept the stock priceeveryone knew they were going to lose money in 3rd quartereveryone knows that they should make money in the 4th quarter the shelf registration was a surprise but as someone point out tesla did it before and look at their stock priceeven if they do sell more shares that will help or growth the businesswhether the short interest is 8090 of the outstanding the shorts will be in trouble if this transformation is successfulwhether the shorts ship sinks 50 feet or 500 feet it is still sunk
i wish yahoo i guess is dropping many of my posts i do not use bad language i state my positions on the stock and why
game over  fun while it lasted
crazy resistance at 395  40
shorts are mad that their inverse bubble is popping

gme beat earnings est by a landslide but still down big like 17 the sp will stabilize around 1401450 for next several days and then make a move up to 1617 area knowing q4 sales will be up huge and will be profitable  q4 earnings est is 180 that will wipe out all 3 qtrs losses and end the year with profit that is not bad for a retail stock which is always being constantly brutalized just saying

this stock in 23 years will be an ecommerce play with stores
why ecommerce needs to be separate from store salesbase 1b ecommerce  3b stores  4b total salesnext year 13b ec  24b stores 37b total salesyear 2 17b ec  19b stores 36b total saleswhat i am trying to illustrate that although the total sales have dropped 10 the ecommerce is growing at 30the market only see the 10 drop thus not valuing the company on its growing e commerce businessthat is why it needs to be separate
i see 50 coming up next let’s go longs keep squeezing

shorts on the weekend therapy
gme has gone as far as it can if you look at history people who have been in a long time will sell and it will drop like it usually does
vw squeeze happening
huge put volume for short term puts if i am not mistaken that indicates the expectation that stock is indicated to go down this is similar to short with less exposure for short squeezefundamentals do not justify price to be above 25
officially a millionaire today
65 close
gamestop will be worth 20x30x what its worth right now in one or two years on fundamentals alone if we squeeze the shorts vw or tsla style itll be worth 1020x times in weeksmonths

citron must be scrambling for a new strategy as we speak hahaha chumps
its funny to see ppl writing sell sell sell because they want to buy low but when its high they say hold hold hold so they can sell lmao
shorts gonna cover tomorrow to lock in those capital losses for tax time
these things always inevitably crash so i bought put spreads on friday if gme continues to spike even higher ill add a little more put spreads and so on the key for me is to maintain this bearish position below 9 of my trading portfolio
longs
dont forget to watch gme history in the making david vs goliath retail investors vs institutionals short sellers institutions are losing the war they got caught and wallstreetbets are killing them

you shorts keep saying nobody wants to buy from gamestop or its the next blockbusterthey increased their ecommerce by 300 and still have 6 billion dollars in revenue a year just because they arent number one doesnt mean they cant grow their business or they are undervalued and thats what you investors cant see im not saying im a visionary ive actually sold my position and am waiting for a dip to rebuy but investors are buying into ryan cohen because hes a visionary with a proven track record and its evident hes made his moves very clearthey dont have to wipe walmartbestbuyamazon out but gamestop is positioning themselves very strongly for ecommerce which people think will take marketshare from the other players clown shorts
they had to halt to make some calls margin calls

dont panic sell if it dips this will  when short squeeze happens
shorts are almost out of maneuvers to keep this down artificially all the planted doom and gloom stories will not be a sufficient reason for the mother of all short squeezes to fail they are stuck and you can literally see the desperation building i predict a 42 close then onto high 40s tomorrow before the dam bursts thursday or friday
140 million shares traded what does that tell you i dont know but 14x normal trading volume tells you something positive is happening
company should offer shares and recapitalize the entire company these people will buy anything
120 here we go baby
should i put 60 k here for a potential double thumbs up yes thumbs down no
there is no legitimate reason for gme to be valued at over 40 per share other than a short squeeze i suspect even the longs realize this once the decline begins this will unravel very quickly the shorts will eventually come out ahead
what is even driving this
there is no stop in gamestop
shorts when they realise their accounts should be green not red
hahahahahahhaha who is buying
im not a bear it will squeeze to the downsidetill insiders dump their shares
looking good right now for a strong finish
this dip not affect us todays target 200
now is the time to start shorting
next short squeeze is omer the fake selling shorts are struggling to walk it down maybe thanks to pressure on their funds from over here thank you
thing of beauty
we’re all plowing into amcx with tremendous short interest guild members hop in monday and push it to 100
i think 200 is more than possible but it will take some time100 is coming soon for sure
only the beginningthis will explode to 70 todayther is no other option shorts r trapped
i shall not sell what gme stock at all to make happy the some scammers
buy this is not over
thank god i recovered my capital the rest doesnt matter now
stop talking about that lemon company buy more shares stop with options you sre not helping
the cat and mouse has gone on for some time the shares have dropped from the 60 high to around 250 and now are on their way back up some short positions were taken to hedge the bonds and some by hedge funds believing gme was going to fail all tolled they have shorted more shares than exist institutions have purchased even more reaching 170 of the float monday the sales estimates for the fourth quarter will be given these numbers will confirm the turn around so what so why should the entities that are short cover after waiting this long my guess is monday could ignite a fire storm the momentum players could start buying along with our small but well informed small investors yesterdays story from one fund manager on cnbc impacted the shares today so just imagine what will happen once this bomb is lit the shares will overshoot to the extreme shorts will cover and in the end they will jump back in the cycle of life in today’s markets
how many shares left to short
little guys not a fan of shorts gme is proving something today amc hopefully follows
added 565
citron and ackerman fd upi am laughing my rear end off couldnt happen to nicer people karma has reared her head omg i am so happy for citron
keep in mind that even though tens of millions of calls finished in the money the shares that will be called in will have to come from the market makers that sold the calls there are not enough shares in existence to cover the short positions given tutes own 170 of the float and insiders now own 35 given cohen is now an insider
short sequeeze to 4547
the window for the shorts to exit is getting smaller and smaller with 1520m shares in the float expect another gamma squeeze and gut wrenching volatility gme to 1kshare is honestly possible when the squeeze begins they will have to buy at the price we want as gme investors again hold and do not lowball yourselves longs your shares are worth absolute gold in a real squeeze and if everyone sells at 1k they will have to buy at 1k
most undervalued stock in the market
it is good time to buy put now
omg trousers 2118 you sold 3500 at 618 just three months ago you’re up to a 53000 loss
this guy is still holdinghttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsl0t8nggmeyoloupdatejan192021
lets also be clear on what a short squeeze is a short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals a short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering liquidating their positionsso what does this mean it means once the technical factors play out the stock returns to normal market dynamics once you flush out the shorts that are deep in the red they are replaced with shorts that have much more attractive bases
i was lucky enough to short at 42 last week and no worries so far no real investing going on just shorts exchanging shares that never existed to begin with the company is in survival mode and they have nothing to add in a saturated market
game stop hahaha this is a game thats going to stop at 50 today
this might gap to 100
wonder how much citron profited from their tweet
i just realized what yolo means for a while i thought it meant people were buying the cannabis etf wow i feel old lol
