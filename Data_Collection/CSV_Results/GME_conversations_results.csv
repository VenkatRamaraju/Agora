CNBC talking heads on GME
"tomorrow i will be taking screen shots of my buy and sell orders that are not executed because ml will not allow them and then get a good attorney.,"
I LOVE  THE STOCK. I WILL NOT SELL UNTIL TARGET PRICE HIT 1000$. CRAMER SHUT UP CROOKED BOOMER AT PAYROLL OF HEDGE FUND.

"YF won't allow me to post link, but check CNBC article on Citron Research caving and begging for mercy. There is a video with it.$nio $AMC $GME $NOK $NAKD"
"The reason why robinhood and other brokerage firms are trying to prevent this squeeze by halting the markets is because they HAVE TO REWARD THE WINNERS.So basically, you’re seeing all the Haltings, short ladder attacks and the banning of buy orders being allowed is because that’s the only way those brokers can cover up their mistakes, which is to make us lose; at the same time they get to avoid the punishment."

"I’m a Boomer. Here’s why I support the $GME $BB $BBBY and $AMC movement.I am older than y’all my daughter is 42 - I know you don’t like us boomers just try to take a minute and hear me out.I want to see Citadel go down. Over the last year, my son in law was invested in a company called Chesapeake Energy. They declared bankruptcy in June 2020. About 6 months before they declared bankruptcy, Citadel worked with Chesapeake and their advisors to swap their Unsecured Bonds for new First Lien bonds against Chesapeake’s assets. All retail investors were shut out of this swap. So one day in January 2020 my son in law woke up and saw that ALL of his bonds - his entire life savings was now behind $4.5 billion in new SECURED debt. Before, they were all equal. Now if a bankruptcy occurred, my son in law was at the back of the line. This entire series of moves was engineered to exclude the retail investor. It protected institutions. They PURPOSELY EXCLUDED HIM AND OTHERS. They transferred his right to repayment to themselves.Before they declared Bankruptcy, Chesapeake negotiated privately with the new Secured Lenders to give them 96% of the new company’s stock and a 70% discount on new stock.My son in law’s life savings was reduced to 4 cents on the dollar while the institutions were able to get 130% of their money back. My son in law was very upset and tried to take a lot of pills on Christmas Eve. He’s okay now though thank God and the doctors.I gave him my $100,000 401(k) since I’ve got a pension plan from working for the power company climbing poles for 35 years. He didn’t have anything left. None of these companies give y’all kids anything.He’s trying to get back his life savings. He invested in the only thing he knows - he’s a petroleum engineer, so he bought $CVX, $OXY and $XOM. We’re hoping they recover so he can get his money back. Everybody thinks oil is evil but natural gas is the bridge from coal to wind and solar. What you kids are doing is incredible. I hope you make a difference. They don’t care about anybody else. Keep running up $GME $AMC $BB $BBBY $NOK - and cost them a lot of money!I know y’all don’t like us boomers but we love y’all kids. Don’t quit trying. Ever."

BUY AND DONT SELL!! SIMPLE RECIPE
Anyone short this stock - enjoy trying to sleep this weekend.
Bloomberg finance mentioned that hedgies are trying to figure out what to do next week when they continue to cover and there are not enough shares available to cover. This is real> LOL just hold.
"hais guys....honestly do you think people are going the hold the stock just because you want it to stick to the man? NO...people are just for themselves, to earn money. GL to bagholders. Or don't be one"
21 MIN. WE HIT 320 AND WE WIN.
To the moon. Hold tight. $GME $AMC $EXPR $BB
HOLD FOR 10K MINIMUM!!!
"Shane41 seconds ago:By 3:30 to closing you should a climb up!What your seeing now is manipulation.Yesterday, Robbing Hood and other brokers sold out to short hedge funds in order to crash the stock.During that time period aka 90% of the day they were allowed to crash the stock while their other buddies aquire cheap shares. To trade today back and forth to create a false indication that stock is dropping on its own."
Scooped up 100 shares @237  these hands are never selling
why are they all up after trading hours? i thought only institutions can trade off hours??
"GME shorts have not begun to close their positions in substantial numbers.the situation (1/28 5 PM ET):• short interest: 100% of float by Ortex, 123.25% of float by S3 Shortsight• change in short share availability: +9,000• robinhood and other brokerages relying on Citadel stopped accepting buy orders on stocks which Citadel wants to allow its hedge funds to unwind from. Robinhood is apparently going so far as to liquidate GME shares in accounts that are not using margin trading(!) If you're still on robinhood, you should find a new broker ASAP. Retail brokers who didn't stab their clients in the back include:◦ vanguard◦ td ameritrade◦ fidelity"
I love how it’s only active for a minute and then halted for 10 Can you say corruption?
Do not shutter buy the dip we are winning!!!!!!!
"If theres any quick lessons this week, it’s holding = power. $GME rocket with holds/squeeze. $VXRT is a diamond with too much short action. Trying to save the world here with an oral vaccine (flu/covid) even poor countries. Let’s go!"
Robinhood = Robingood people
UAVS only has 58 million shares outstanding....share price will rocket to $300 against those shorts
Hold the line team. 1pm - 4pm will surely be rocky. United we stand. Retail traders need to be heard 
MY FRIEND IS 24 and he’s down 1.26 million dollars on margin due to Robin Hood.... he would be up 300k otherwise..... LAW SUITS COMING! RIP ROBINHOOD IPO.... they just want to help hedge funds because they will stabilize there IPO.... CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
"They can's get away with it! It's being looked into...From Robinhood “ We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."""
AOC just tweeted again she’s hosting a live stream to talk about this tonight.Hold!!!’
How high can this go? I set my sell order at $1900 too low??
Buy the dip!!!!!!
Robinhood CEO talking a lot of #$%$ on Bloomberg. I hope they go out of business.
"It doesn't matter what the price of GME is at the moment. It becomes MORE valuable as the price goes up because it forces the hedge fund guys to cover their margined short positions at this point no matter how ""rich"" they are."
"This is following the exact same pattern as $GME did. Last chance to buy today, monday it will def. fly"
Shorty drives the price lower so they can cover. The pressure is approaching by 4:30pm EST today. Hold strong!!! Reversal is coming.
HOOOLD IT AND IF YOU ARE ABLE GET SOME MORE AMMO! $BB $AMC $GME
"think of it why it is not moving, bcos shorts are pushing it to go down. Lets not allow this and push it back... Next $gme or $amc is here... Don't sell, just hold it. The current price is not bobble."
Andrew Left of Citron says he's 'out' of shorting. Yea right. What this means is Citron will no longer PUBLISH a short report. They will still have their 'backdoor' grapevine so it will still be coordinated. The only difference is they will no longer be transparent about shorting. He's trying to throw you off his trail. He has ruined many companies & lives for years. I'M NOT BUYING WHAT YOUR SELLING ANDREW!
"ROBINHOOD TO ALLOW ""LIMITED"" TRADING $AMC $GME TOMORROW"
should I sell my Amc to join Gme?!?!?
How did you find GameStop?
"Shorts you deserve every SINGLE ounce of punishment that is delivered here. Justice will be served. You just don't get it, you CREATED this mess. Wall Street bets did nothing except spot the weakness in your armor and exploit it. Which is PRECISELY what you have been doing to retail investors who invest in companies they believe in. Your greed will devour you. Cover your position and quit reloading because it will only get worse. Thanks to you $GME may never withdraw from these unbelievable levels."
How many people sat here holding and watching live streams/ searching news? Been here most of the day
I do support this matter! No matter what...I'm in with a lot of money!
THEY DO SHORT LADDER TO LET US BUY MORE CHEAPLY?HOW KIND!! THANK YOU MUACKSSSS$GME $NAKD $AMC $BB $BBYL $AAL $KOSS $EXPR
"Can I still buy first thing Monday, or have I missed out? Funds clear tonight at close :("
My bank isn't letting me sell...
"The lies with end of November spreaded through citron Andrew Left about $NIO were for sure spreaded by him due to his awareness, that otherwise the biggest short squeeze in history was coming to the world and at him with $NIO with end of November. And for sure Elon paid him to spread this lies, it was not a random happening that Elon a few days before that attacked NIO on twitter and he fore sure just prepared with that the nonsense nonmaterial s and p pump of tsla a few days later. It is funny how Karma gets him on the nuts just a few months later with $GME . WELL DESERVED I HOPE CITRON AND HIS  SHORTER ARMY GOES BANKRUPT."
just HOLD its not about profits!!!!!!
Looks like the adults cut off the kids fun. can't buy GME only sell. The bag holders are racking up massively.
Coordinated short ladder attacks. Hold your ground. Push for over 320 at close at least! Or the options finish OTM.Holldddddd
If DFV can hold with his diamond sack- you can too!!!!Don’t give them a single share until the short interest has them begging us to sell.
"So $Goog deleted 100k 1 star reviews yesterday on Robinhood and all trying to protect hedge funds? Robinhood lost 35% of their users yesterday alone and already had to drawn down billions in lines of credit. They will be bankrupt by next week, does everyone just want to go bankrupt? When will they learn $AMC $GME $NAKD $EXPR"
TO VALHALLA
short % of float is up to over 225% ....just check your key statistics on Yahoo or any other platform
"Adrian Gabriel-2 hours ago YESSSSSS!As in reddit we said...all.we have to do its hold, they are praying for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. SHORTS are hoping that they can make back their money at our expense, because every single day that they hold their short positions is costing them billion of dollars collectively. All we need to do its hold , we will cost them so much money today if we hold. Next"
Short % is still 120.... suits have to buy... this will hit 1000
I HAVE A QUESTION FRIENDS;DO YOU BELIEVE ?
"Already in, but added some buy support at $225 for the inevitable short ladders"
GME to $5000+ per share IS NOT A MEME PEOPLE! We can literally set our own price for each share. HOLD YOUR SHARES!
Is there any online broker who didn't block buying?
"No one should take my advice because I’m not giving it. It’s an opinion and some knowledge of the facts. But every brokerage firm made this a cash position, which means a short can NOT hold on to this over the weekend if it stays up in this range, by 3:30 this is going to start going nuts. On Monday of it open over $800 I wouldn’t be surprised!! You can hold and be a part of history."
If you’re commenting on other stocks you should go to another chat lol this is GME! Gamestonk 
If A Person Sells A Stock Short At $5 And That Stock Later Goes To $5000.00 It Is Just The Way It Is.
we are together Don feel alone and don't sell just hold for Next week!! Big squeeze
I will tell my kids I took part in this feat
Robinhood set buy orders to only 10. That’s it. Wow
they are trying so hard to pin in under 320
Money comes and goes... but you'll remember this your whole life!! I am down a few hundred dollars but I don't care. I just wanted to be a part of this. Hooooolddddd!!

"Thumbs up if you'd like to see GME as a currency that can be sent peer-to-peer via Venmo, accepted in GameStop stores, and which pays 32% interest.Thumbs down if you're short and this would cost you a lot of money."
"Hello everyone, I'm not a shareholder but just wanted to say that restricting the purchase of this stock is .........disgusting and wrong on all levels, this should be 1000000000000000% illegal and is the same as someone telling you that you do not have the freedom of speech, The biggest crooks on Wallstreet is Wallstreet with insider trading and all the rest. hope this continues to 5000 per share."

"whats to stop GME mgmt from doing a 1m share issue at $100? Raise $100m for the coffers to come up with a new pan, additional liquidity for shorts and those who bought at $300? seriously messed up investors splatted on the windshield like a bug"
"I just heard about GME story 2 days ago, I bought today at $320 ! Looking at > $1000 . Let’s press on !!!"
I don’t recall tsla being restricted? Why don’t Robinhood stop buying of tsla or other inflated stocks too? Something smells rotten with what Robinhood did prohibiting people from buying. Could it be Robinhood is in collusion to bring down the gme stock to profit themselves in some way?
"When you against the Elite of Financials who have the best tools, media and politics behind them. I see everybody standing holding and buy. I know my 3 year old daughter is blessed to have the Millennial generation above here. You kids take what belongs to you and make the world a better place.God bless you all. Hold on to these shares, it only cost you time. These guys are going to pay from their noses"
the sooner shorts start lining up to close their position the better off they will be.
Has to hold $300 for the gamma squeeze then the new shorts are next above $350. They will push it to $450 in a race to cover.
I strongly believe that $MRO can be next GME and they also give dividends if you have shares on 17 February
BUY THE DIPS 1000 COMING SHORTS HAMMERED DESPERATE

Robinhood and Reddit aren't allowed to manipulate stocks for massive profits.That's only for The Federal Reserve and the Banksters.
We have caused a reaction that has snowballed
The moment american brokerages resume trading this is going to $1000
$1000 by tomorrow
We could see $1000 on Monday. Maybe even aftermarket.
lots of fomo traders will show up today too
David and goliath. David wins finally !I love the guys that pulled this off.
Stick it to the man and buy puts!! Take your gains and now make money on the way down!!
leave Robinhood ASAP and teach them a lesson.They are clearly trying to hold back stock's rise and interfering with the flow of market.
"HOLDERS, THERE IS NO PRICE CEILING HAHAHAHA it is theoretically INFINITE. Tear them a new one!!"
so how do we drive this up more
FINAL TEST
ANYONE telling you to buy anything other than GME IS A BOT.DO NOT LISTEN. HOLD THE LINE.
you realize that robinhood is the same guys shorting this stock right
Oh look! Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel : https://www.citadel.com/leadership/dr-ben-s-bernanke/
"Hedge fund shorters, the gamestops here!"
the brokerages limited buy orders to help hedge funds. The NYSE didn't take action cuz there was no fraud.
"What’s the daily record for number of halts on a stock? GME might break it. Also, how many hedge fund managers kill themselves tomorrow if this stays over $300?"
"Reuters: More Robinhood customers sue online brokerage in Chicago, New York over trade halts, per court filings."
don't be surprised at the outrageous price you will see tomorrow and next week. The system is both rigged and really bad at math.
To simplify for us Apes 5 bananas cost 10 bucks.Apes are selling 5 bananas for 10 bucks. Snakes ask to borrow the bananas and instead sell the bananas. They think the price will go down and that they can buy them back later for cheaper. The apes notice the sneaky move and so buy all the bananas. Apes strong together.
"Robinhood supports criminal trading practices and yesterday they let their clients start trading Reddit stocks right after market closed while other brokers like interactive ,etrade etc did dot raise suspension untill this morning. Already their clients pumped those stocks up 50% while clients of other brokers could not. This is not free trade policy and is blatant market manipulation which deemed a class action law suit and a criminal practice.Vlad should go to jail"
"Shorting over 100% of a stock should not be allowed. You can short some stock of an overvalued company, no problem. You make the market more efficient by doing it. But shorting 120% of a company in financial distress is just mean. It may make you money, but real lives and families are hurt if the company goes bankrupt. In this particular case, the bad guys probably got what they deserved..."
Robin Hood CEO is going to be on CNBC interview in just a few minutes.
"For whoever is waiting the dip to buy more, the dip is NOW, we are pointing higher towards the close as option contracts will expire and shorts will be forced to buy"

This battle will end up in financial history books. Where were you when this epic battle happened? Did you side with the good guys or did you collude with the evil hedgefunds? Dont be on the wrong side of history! Buy and hold!

"Lol the main stream media is calling for regulation and calling us the enemy of the market. Wow that’s rich.These predatory hedge funds are getting taught a lesson and NOW they want to regulate? Hold onto these shares like gold for weeks and bleed them dry!!!I just heard CNBC painting us as criminals stealing from poor billionaires and that Robinhood CEO eel Vlad was lying through his teeth. If he doesn’t go to jail you know the game is rigged. He’s getting kickbacks and money for order flow from Citadel and then buying is halted?Give me a break!!! Write your congressman, tell your friends, it’s 2008 all over again and they want you to take another fall! Hold until they suffocate!!!!"
"set my call options in 2023 at over $1000. I know it's a bit unrealistic but hey these hedge fund guys can do whatever they want to so why can't the impossible happen to me. If you can make sure it gets filled, thanks in advance. Also, $BB as well. Keep up the good work with $GME"

Its so nice they give us these smoke breaks.
"As you can see by the volume being smaller and smaller, you guys buying right now will LOSE EVERYTHING. Smart guys moved away.

How long do the short have to cover? Can they hold short forever or is there a date they must buy back for every short how it works ?
Keep it above 300! HOLD!!!
"Just some free advice:This isn’t going to end well for most of you with the people saying ‘HOLD’ being the ones who will be left holding the bag of this pump and dump.There’s an economic law that you’re all going to run into very soon as the animal spirits cool. It’s known as “Herbert Stein’s Law” and you won’t escape it.My advice is to not pump for others to dump. Take your gains and be happy because the reality of this equity being only worth $8-25/share is going to prevail.Good luck and wish you all success and I hope this experience will encourage you and the burn that’s coming doesn’t discourage you to seek a real education and future in economics, investment and finance."

Maybe short already buy out all of their short stock while Last night to today. GME Short % need to be check for now.
Cbdt is bound to go any day here. Get in while the price is low
"This ""movement"" is not helping these highly shorted companies other than giving them free press. They're just creating extreme shorting opportunities when they fall back to reality. Some like KOSS already squeezed before the big runnup (Short interest dropped 98% per 1/15 data) but now the very institutions that are demonized will make out better than ever with the little guy holding the bag.GME was a unique situation because of the turnaround and 140% SI, I know because I had GME stock for over a year and was waiting forever for the squeeze that I started to think would never happen so I got out in December having finally been freed from holding that bag although I missed out on a $15M gain, it wasn't worth risking the money I made. As much as people despise Citron, Left was being generous when he stated GME was worth $20 a share and at some point that rocket will have to crash to earth leaving retail investors holding the bag, institutions profiting handsomely, and Gamestop a forgotten tatters, that is unless Ryan Cohen snags it up with his short squeeze winnings and turns it around after offering a generous $20 or more per share. However, I have a feeling Papa Cohen is stuck between a rock and a hard place, this is what he planned but he didn't expect it to go this crazy and he has a few secrets that could get him in a lot of trouble."
LETS GOOOOO
PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS
Don't just pay the market price. offer even more so the price goes higher.
"FREE $15,000.00 down payment for first time hime buyers."
Amazing to me how many people are willing to throw their money at something they know nothing about. Warning. You will not make any money. If you’re lucky you’ll sell and not lose much.
"My plan for the next week.Congrats for GME holders, I am holding onto my GME for the final squeeze. For me GME is a hold till it reaches the 4 figures.AMC is still at a bargain, they are not at risk of any bankruptcy anymore, movies coming out, and they got a huge marketing. I am going to keep buying AMC, because it is just the beginning of the story.For the other stocks on the list.. I think we have to regroup and focus stock by stock, but I think rn, some people got a good price at it, till we all come and it’s their turn to be squeezed.One last thing: Citadel and the brokers who blocked trades on your stocks either you sold them or not…. That was 100% manipulation, and it is basically billionaires stealing from all of you retail investors… even if you didn’t loose $, if they did not do that your positions would have been a lot higher.. game on next week!"
LEAVE ROBINHOOD....as they’re planning an IPO soon And have restricted your ability to buy $AMC $BBBY $GME $GTE $KOSS $NAKD and other high flying stocks . STICK IT TO THEM.....Pull your money and go to E*TRADE FIDELITY TD WEBULL....with no restrictions......Crush the shorts and the Mafia Robinhood App.....️......GIVE them this 
Market stops everyone from buying while they figure things out just like election day when they all stopped counting votes to figure out how many votes they needed. The system is broke!
"Tick tock tick tock, time is running out, shorts. Is this where you'd thought we'd be right now? Did you expect yesterdays dip to tank us? We can smell the panic"
"Trades take 2 days to settle, the clearing houses charge the brokerage firms fees during the holding period. Once this turd started flying high and reversing, the fees become untenable. Therefore, the clearing houses stopped the brokerage from allowing new shares to be purchased. It was not the platform. Webull just was informed as well, and stopped new trades."
300+ close
"SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLDUPVOTE AND SHAREIn the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!"
I sold my profits from $GME and bought Tesla at $796..I feel guilty..no not really
This will bankrupt Wall Street...
"I know TD Ameritrade and Robinhood restricted and/or banned the buying of GME, Nokia, AMC etc. Does anyone know which brokerages didn't restrict the free market of buying of stocks???"
"it it closes at $400 today, how many CALLs will end up in the money???? How many shorts will need to buy after hour and Monday???? anyone knows??"
Seen to many time sell off only to rebound double way to soon to look they shorts are in panic mode but one share and hold !
Don’t think just buy. After this we can meet at the welfare house to discuss our epic battle.
it seems hedgefunds would rather liquidate good stocks and crash the market to pay retail back for getting caught naked shorting.

Could you imagine what would happen if those stimulus checks were showing up on Monday?
How is this not market manipulation? A brokerage firm cannot cold call all their of their clients and manufacture momentum without any basis in fundamentals. That's a pump and dump scheme. Why is it ok if reddit commenters do it on a much larger scale?

"Thank you. Sincerely thank you! I am old and have been screwed out of so much money trying to be a retail investor. I have watched for years the pure manipulation of the markets by the “big guys.” What you millennials did here is pure genius! I wish I wasn’t stuck on the sidelines - but watching this crumble, watching the hedge fund managers scream for regulation, listening to them say they need to protect you from yourself is worth every penny I have lost.

GME and AMC holding. not getting it from me.
Just heard on fox business they are limiting buys if gme to 1 at a time. Just heard this 1 minute ago
"They smelled weakness and pounced. With all the focus on $GME this is where they could strike. Today they got it under $15 and won, but there is too much momentum for $BB to stay down for long, this thing is going to $40 within a month."
"I HOPE THEY ALL GO TO PRISON. If you are long in ANY position on the market, you should be #$%$ The big guys just rigged the game, they changed the rules. I know this has been a joke for many, but just think about if you were invested heavily in a stock, and the powers that be let the rug be pulled out from under your feet. Obviously no one should be playing with their entire life savings on this stock, but what happened was not a fair event in the slightest. Note I don't even have a position in this stock, but I believe in a free market."
IT’S BACK ON!!!!Robinhood to allow trading tomorrowOf GME!!!!!!
"Lol... hedges are gonna let this run and run, then make up all they lost and MORE.., it has always been such!"

You need to figure out who at the DTCC threatened trading brokers into stopping trading on Gamestop.They likely have deep money ties to Citadel and the short positions on GME.
Time to make them pay 
"ADAM MCKAY ALREADY WORKING ON ""THE BIG SQUEEZE""Can't wait to watch it."

"To the WSB guys: congrats on forcing a short squeeze and knocking the hedge funds down a few billion pegs. My advice: take your profits and get out now. GME isn't going to $1,000. This trade is going to unwind, and when it does, it's going to happen quickly."
Short ratio is a solid 112%A CNBC interview also praised how solid WSB DD was.
Close your Robinhood account. Forget about your IPO robinhood
IM NOT SELLING
Citron OUT!
didn't surprise me that robinhood has limited amd purchases to just 1 share.$AMD has same ratio to cover 2days as $AMC and $BB and compare to $GME which has 6 days.The short squeeze we were waiting for with AMD might be just around the corner. One main difference is $AMD also has the fundamentals intact to keep it going after the squeeze.
Still early
Any name for mutual fund of RH restricted stocks? I would love to start one!
close robinhood accounts
They are flooding the market with sell side orders to artificially drop the price. They decimated demand by blocking retail traders from buying and flooded the market with shares.
Why does this halt feel longer than all the previous halts?
Melvin where is hunters laptop?
"There is still a lot of short interest in GME from hedge funds. They are currently sitting on $19B losses collectively, but this would increase if the share price holds or increases. The squeeze is just starting. ""The losses haven't been realized - they're estimates based on data provided by lenders, brokers, and dealers. But they give a sense of the scale of the hit to hedge funds and other short-sellers.""https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/short-sellers-sitting-on-19-billion-of-losses-on-gamestop-data-shows-2021-1-1030020684"

Stop telling us to SELL!!!!!!!!!!!! Holding the bag? Option expire today shorts need to cover at some point. They want our shares!!!!!!!!
Put buy order and take screen short. send email to your broker asking to cover any losses you might get whens tock go higher. They need to pay highest price it trade after that.
THIS WILL EXPLODE NEXT WEEK 5K
"Which brokerages have allowed traders to buy GME throughout this time? I know some lists have been posted before but just want to be sure. I am angry that my brokerage, Merrill Edge, stopped traders from buying GME for a long amount of time today, even though I have no position in GME and haven't taken one throughout this time."
Here comes the short ladder. Remember what happened yesterday and how we opened today? hold everyone
What are the odds everyone closes their robin hood accounts and bankrupts them. I hope it happens

Robinhood is a private company just like facebook and Twitter. don't cry when you lose it all.
"bought the dip, thank you !"
Should Robinhood stop retail for buying any stock in US market because the whole stock market is inflated?
I’m so proud of you guys for holding  best stonk ever!!! 
the shorts have been stubborn and refused to close their positions alot earlier. now this cause retail investors to lose money as they weren't allowed to buy yesterday? doesn't make sense why rich people can over leverage and the common people pay for it when it goes bad
If you need a thousand dollars SIMPLY BUY ONE SHARE.. 
They made it hard to buy the stock and easy to sell manipulating the market to make the stock go down this will backfire on them. The people are holding

2 lawsuits just got filed against RH. $GME $AMC $BB $SNDL WSB is for the retail investors and to make sure both individuals and hedge funds have an even ground in the free market.

"SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATEHedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze. It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON. WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK"

THIS IS LEAVING THE GALAXY AFTER HOURS
"It’s after hours and interactive brokers and a few others have still suspended buying GME,KOSS,AMC.BBBY but how come these stocks go 30% up after hours ""? I suspect fraud and foul play to halt trading these stocks while trading is permitted behind the curtains only for a selected few,hedge funds etc....sec needs to act now because free trade is compromised and something illegal is going on with these trade halts."
We may see 1000 usd before lunch time!

"Stock is up AH because millions of retail longs were prevented from buying by their brokerages.Whenever the buying ban is lifted, this thing sets a new high.How is it that a bunch of reddit trolls buying a $14B stock could cause such an issue for wall street?"
Volume still low. We are holding the line. Buy more when it dips and hold until they’re bursting at the wallets!!!
"THE $AMC GAME PLAN!WSBs plan is to have limit orders for $1,000 so the shorts covering have no choice but to buy back their shares at $1,000 each, so this will be our plan aswell. Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone did. This means that AMC's stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000.Because $AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of today no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.$AMC $GME $BB $NOK $NAKD $SNDL"
Can you buy gme??? ROBINDHOOD
Bears up at night trying to explain why GME is bad

"never seen so many stocks halted, they are shaking in their boots"
"When I put the price, no one can challenge. Just keep in mind 389-450 by US standards, and 550-600 by Chinese.I play and play safely.It was nice week, and everyone has nice n.lovely weekend. It's lovely weather in Bay Area."
I believe there is a correlation between WSB stocks and the drop DOW has experienced this week. It’s like we’re having people selling stocks to buy in $gme $amc $koss etc. When you look at the charts they look like they move opposite directions.
"Buy and HOLD, there are no shares left for the brokers, they'll have to pay whatever we want, several thousand dollars a piece."
if they would've covered at 60 instead of trying to force a selloff and twisting themselves into a pretzel this never would have happened
Just keep holding. We’re doing great. They must be bleeding out in interest. They can’t keep this up forever!
I’m leaving Robinhood. They shouldn’t be restricting trades
"THIS DID the same thing yesterday at the exact same time, everyone sold...then it rallied back up 100$ right away"
"I don't get it. The largest holding of this stock are institutional holders, not retailers. And it's been traded almost its entire float on a daily basis for past several days (46 million shares), which suggest most people who say they won't sell are lying. Can someone explains this to me?"
How long until the WSP crowd realize that its the big money that is holding this stock up to sell to the retail and then short it into oblivion?
idk where you guys are getting it from but $NOK $GME $AMC were never blocked from buying/selling on TD ameritrade.
"Short squeeze incoming! Remember Volkswagen! Don’t sell today, this is just the beginning!"
"Shorts on here are so desperate. Options expiring ITM today will be the nail in their coffin, so they're scrambling to try and get you to sell"
"So Ive been fighting in GME , AMC and a small position in BB, I wonder why we didnt just rally hard on Friday and let get caught by surprised like how GME exploded on Monday? These extra last couple days gave wallstreet time to think of a plan."
AOC is demanding a probe into Robinhood for halting trade that led to this selloff. Congress will intervene and we will succeed
$SLS maybe not 150 today but in the very near term. Every previous data readout (which should have moved the market cap over a billion already) has caused a massive move up only to be shorted down by funds knowing they could cover with an offering ... No longer. Now that SLS has cash to fund operations for five plus years... There will be no short escape route - just $GME like Squeeze Pressure

"The simple fact is, Robinhood blocked retail traders from buying, only allowed them to sell, thus creating one sided market with no buyers only sellers, which is market crash whenever bidders disappear. The purpose is to allow hedge funds to cover. By the way, cover is buy. Right, hedge funds can buy, but retail traders cannot. Look at the chart of v shape. Who are the buyers????"

What's the plan?
"I just heard on Squawk Box that Robinhood announced a cap raise late last night and that they are planning an IPO later this year. Supposed because of what they did yesterday, they raised more money. It is unknown (per Squawk Box) how many customers will flee because of what they did yesterday. SB feels that the liquidity question to the CEO of Robinhood may have been a semantics issue about whether they were trying to prevent a liquidity issue or if they had a liquidity problems. Either way, RH was facing some sort of liquidity issue supposedly."
"Dont ever forget, the shorts wanted to make an extra profit, that they dont really need, by pressuring this company to go bankrupt and leave the employees jobless and who knows how many of them was gonna struggle to feed his family."

Apparently Robinhood is limiting people from buying more. citadel is behind it all

"Trying to get a full scoop of all the damage done today. It looks like a big fund sold a bunch of different strikes for the PUTS as a hedge. They also picked up some CALLS, but they should have done a lot more. Some of the volume actually a lot was short ladders and short shoots where the same fund was trading back and forth, but lowering the price. they are not even close to out of this stock on the short side or on the CALLS. If they don't cancel people's ability to buy tomorrow I think we go a lot higher. Getting out of Etrade, Robinhood ect and jumping to Fidelity"
Shorts have to cover if they get a margin call or put up cash!Why do you think Citadel lent $2 billion to Melvin!They put up cash because they thought they could out wait retail!

Polygon reports: That's because, on Wednesday, a private equity firm named Silver Lake -- and private equity firms are popularly considered the ""bad guys"" in this snobs-versus-slobs drama -- elected to convert the corporate bonds it held into AMC Entertainment Holdings stock. Although the theater chain's stock price has tumbled and soared since the move, the debt relief is permanent.

If anything just shows how the huge price drop was fake. If anything you should’ve bought more. Just hold and chill.

"SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UP VOTE AND SHAREIn the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!GET RID OF THE STOP LOSSES, THEY WILL TRY HUNT THEMIt's possible the ladder attack at the end of day yesterday was just a trial run for today. They held the price where they wanted it (around 227) for ages, and then with just one ladder attack got it to 197 which had two effects:Caused a volatility halt at 15:59:41 - so we had no chance to get it back over 200 in those remaining 19 seconds 2) Made sure the EOD price was under 200I think today there is a chance that they won't go for 150, 115 or 100, but just take the guarantee of hitting under 200. Take a beating over a killing.They will want it resting on around 227 and then time their attack to sneak it just under 200 with the halt in place to see out the clock. So if it is ~227+ with under 10 mins to go, we know what they will do. And those few minutes before it could be crucial."

I don't know how you guys pulled this off but I am so happy you are doing it. 71yrs old here. Could someone let me in on the next stock short you are going to target PLEASE?
"I see that CNBC reported that Melvin and Citron closed out short positions, but how do we really know that they did? CNBC is not known for taking the little guys’ side. Heck in his hedge fund days, Cramer bragged about shorting a stock and then shorting again at the end of the day repeatedly to manipulate the stock down. I went to the Melvin site and they list a large put position on gme. Hopefully it expires out of the money for them but to be honest, I don’t know if they wrote a put or bought one. Melvin reported unwinding the short for 100% loss. I doubt at 140% short of float they would be able to limit the loss to 100%. I don’t really trust the reporting here. Also, robinhood sells traders’ data like stop loss positions to the hedge funds. I don’t see how there is not a huge insider trading investigation when robinhood only allows one sided (sell) trades in a stock that is shorted by their biggest data buyer. I don’t trust any of this. Wish I had the stones to join you guys in sticking it to the real criminals on Wall Street. I don’t think there will be justice here because the Reddit guys don’t own politicians like Wall Street does. Not being political I feel both sides are crooked."

"If 5 authors for Bloomberg news team up to publish a story, does that make their lie into a fact?

Why the need for propaganda and lies from the media every single day? And Yahoo! Why even share Bloomberg article without a fact check???"

"Time for a second run-up. GME seems to be VERY valuable to the hedge funds now. So the market should respond and agree that the shares are worth buying. If these firms are as greedy as they've shown and need to recoup the losses we know of, then they must be re-shorting again GME to. Next week will be another re-peat of THIS week UP, UP, UP, except you'll have time to dump Robinhood and Interacitve Brokers who are funded by hedge funds and find real brokers that will allow you to trade both IN and OUT of positions. Robinhood is the classic example of a predator in sheep's clothing. BTW, get shares of actual stock and put into NON margin account. In that fashion, the shares cannot be loaned out by your broker."

Close this over $500 ++++THEN sell back to them. They still have to buy back a lot of shares to cover short interest - its still at 120%!!! That's A LOT. Even 60% short interest is normally astronomical. Buy-buy!
"Even the excuse that Robinhood is supposedly trying to protect the retailers is flawed. By limiting everyone's buying ratio, whilst allowing anyone to short the stock just makes the gap bigger and bigger until retailers lose. No wonder they're getting sued. Everyone has the capacity to do their own research and purchase a stock at the valuation they see fit. Brokers can feel free to inform us about the risks, but cutting us off like that?? Nah that ain't it. If the SEC and all the higher-ups truly cared for our ""loss"", they would've helped everyone out in 2008 and not only the Hedge funds. This fact alone goes to show that they're trying to save their own skin again, making the rich richer, whilst claiming they're doing it for the people. History always repeats itself, how about this time y'all be on the right side? HOLD & BUY"
"From WaPo: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/29/robinhood-citadel-gamestop-reddit/Robinhood and Citadel’s relationship comes into focus as Washington vows to examine stock-market moves.Trading firms at center of Reddit-fueled stock surges have worked closely to share users’ market data, build political influence.By Douglas MacMillan and Yeganeh TorbatiJan. 29, 2021 at 5:49 p.m. ESTRobinhood, the online trading app heralded by some as a democratizing force to empower small investors, has spent the past few years nurturing a close relationship with one of Wall Street’s biggest players and building ties with some of the most powerful institutions in Washington.The Silicon Valley-based trading platform makes a large amount of revenue from Citadel Securities, a Chicago-based financial-services giant. Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest.Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show. The app also works with Virtu, G1 Execution Services, Wolverine and Two Sigma.Robinhood’s relationships with these investment firms is likely to face new scrutiny after the online broker took the extraordinary step Thursday of limiting trading of certain stocks that were propelled to meteoric heights by conversations on Reddit message boards. After the trading halt, Reddit users accused Citadel and its billionaire founder, Ken Griffin, of pressuring Robinhood to limit trading of certain stocks, a move that may have prevented further losses for the short-sellers that lost billions betting against GameStop.On Twitter and the Reddit forum Wallstreetbets, retail investors speculated that Robinhood had caved to pressure from its powerful business partner. Because the company does not charge its users any fees, a key part of Robinhood’s business model relies on Citadel and similar companies.In a blog post Thursday afternoon, Robinhood strongly denied its move was influenced by the large investment firms it works with to execute trades. “This was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to,” the company wrote. A spokeswoman for Robinhood declined to comment on the company’s relationships with market makers.Josh Zeitz, a spokesman for Citadel Securities, said in a statement that the company “has not instructed or otherwise caused any brokerage firm to stop, suspend, or limit trading or otherwise refuse to do business.”Citadel LLC, a separate hedge fund also founded by Griffin, recently helped bail out Melvin Capital, a fund that sank 30 percent in a few weeks after shorting GameStop.

Almost every stock that had a short interest over 15% got hammered today. Do you think that's a coincidence? I think it's collusion amongst short-sellers and hedge funds. Will the SEC investigate that? I doubt it. They are too busy looking into Reddit message boards amongst retail traders.
GO GO GO..MAKE THOSE OPTIOS EXPIRE!!!! :-))) EPIC SHORT SQUEEEEZE
"If you haven't closed your robinhood account yet, what in the world are you doing?"
Don’t forget to help us in AMC! We are all together!!!
"Don’t just make this a one hit wonder. Use your new found wealth to blow up shorties in every sector. This is your 15 minutes of fame, but it might last years if you play your cards right."
Congressional investigations should start against Robin-hood CEO to grill him for“Who hell you think you are to manipulate free market”America  based on free market.

KEEP BUYING 113% ARE STILL SHORTING THEY THINK IT WILL CRASH BECAUSE WE WILL ALL TURN OUR BACKS ON EACH OTHER AND SELL DO NOT GIVE IN  
"HOLD, DIAMOND HANDS"
Breaking news Robinhood allowing limited buys at GameStop AMC starting tomorrow. 
They were saying we were gonna sell and give up  We holding $300+
Now you can see hedge funds secretly covering minor amounts of stocks AH.
"Shorts have to cover today, and it is not looking good for them."
robinhood should be shut down--it was criminal--everyone who has robinhood should leave

"On quote from Robin Hood: So in other words destroy the revolution, the investors - not suspend the market, but only sellers are allowed to trade. In other words only those supporting the position of Hedge funds shorting the stock are permitted to trade. Can you imagine if the reverse happened? At least the corruption is laid bare, that's something - I hope Robin Hood gets destroyed. Then the next retail-platform will realise what not to do. From Robinhood “ We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."""
i feel my long call and luck (my consipiracy where they have bot betting agaist my account) causing pause. So I close that. Other account still very hard to trade (Which one I lost almost entirely before recovering 200K back) but will close position there (Which still negative side above 400) due to naked short call.

Can we sue the brokage firms and SEC for not letting us buy the stocks like GME and BB?
Never trust a guy named Vlad.
Andrew Left and Citron did a hit piece on Namaste Tech a while back and it sunk that stock. A Left and others are still shorting it. Would be a smart target for WSB with its 20cent share price after GME destroys the hedge funds in NY.
infinite squeeze here lads hold as if you're going for 10k

Low volume. Price is being manipulated. HOLD ON FFS
They are flooding the market with sell side orders to artificially drop the price. They decimated demand by blocking retail traders from buying and flooded the market with shares.this is just hedge funds selling to each other to spoof the market. DIAMOND HANDS! HOLD!
Brokerages are only allowing you to sell shares now. So consider who is buying your shares if no one on your platform is allowed to buy... it’s the big boys getting a free pass to buy BUT ONLY IF YOU SELL. HOLD THE LINE DO NOT GIVE THESE GUYS A FREE PASS

I can see why Short selling would be stopped if it's not covered but I do not understand why buying long would be stopped when you have cleared funds. The Robin Hood explanation is far from the truth.
do not get faked out buy the dip
"If you guys want to make some money with a gaming stock check out BHAT trading at 1.25 on the nasdaq, recent contracts announced in press releases, recent acquisition announced today, 50 million market cap, 12 million on the float, profitable, and growing exponentially, insiders are holding lots of stock and recent increased hedge fund accumulation in the last month or so, current ratio of 3.42 with a book value listed at .95 cents, stock should go back to 4 dollars in the next few months or sooner. Research and verify what I’m saying, good luck."
I think traders have a good class action lawsuit against the brokerages that restricted buying and only allowed sells.
The people are taking back what’s rightfully ours!
Can a brokerage house use your shares against you the answer is yes ! And they get paid to do it! Look up securities lending .
"Now that I see the stonkmarket is rigged thanks to $GME, me and Elon Musk love $bitcoin more. $mgti and $mara areboth bitcoin miners. Diversify"
DO NOT SELL A SINGLE SHARE!
Hedge funds just simulate a fall in stock price. There are no real shares behind this. Uncovered short sells. But that wont work longterm. Hold your shares and buy the dips we get atleast to 500$ a share!
"This is going to be another historic year but this year it will be Wall St that gets burned. I believe that through the power social media uniting everyone together to fight against billionaires on Wall St that AMC and $GME will soar possibly to $10,000 and higher. It will be historic and leave Wall St in ruins. This is JUST THE BEGINNING! Do not underestimate the POWER behind what is driving this. These are MOVEMENT STOCKS now. Many are buying them not to make money but as nothing a statement to the billionaire class on Wall St."

In the end they will say that its financial terrorists attacking our Democracy and the foundation of of financial systems
The hedge funds will have to pay me $1000 per share if they want my shares tomorrow.
Invest in GME and AMC. Anywhere else and we risk spreading the army too thin. Games and Movies for life!
STOP MAKING NEW POST JUST UPVOTE your brothers and sisters. we all saying the same things. let people read.
Stopped over from AMC to wish you guys luck!!! 
It's quite a simple equation. If every broker is restricting buys and only allowing sells. Who is actually buying? What a short manipulation by hedge funders.
Holding 100 shares not selling
Hold!!!!!! God is with us!!! It’s time the regular people get money to support their families!!!! Hold!!! Listen fellas! Hold!! Yahoo will delete my message soon.

Right now they are cornered, and they are trying to scare you and divide you into buying other stocks, dont fall for it, Gme can go up to 1000$ pps if you hold on.Stay strong and united."
$BIGC reported it was best quarter for them . E-commerce and pandemic and Black Friday. I guess it’s common sense how $BIGC ER will be in coming days. $BIGC also most shorted stock like $GME $AMC so short squeeze can happen any time.

"just got this email lol An update on market conditionsHi matthew,It’s been a tough day, and we’re grateful to you for being a Robinhood customer. In light of the extraordinary market conditions this week, we temporarily limited buying for certain securities this morning. Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. This was a temporary decision made to best continue serving you, and was not an easy one to make. We know it’s led to frustration and confusion, and wanted to provide some clarity.As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.The past year in particular has shown us that the financial markets are for everyone—not just institutional investors and hedge funds. We’ve seen a new generation enter the market, and they’re sparking conversations about what it means to be an investor. We stand in support of you, our customers. Democratizing finance for all means giving more people access, not less.We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and will update this Help Center article with the latest changes. We also published a blog post regarding today’s events. Changes due to ongoing market volatilityDue to ongoing market volatility, the following securities are currently set to position-closing only:AALAMCBBBBBYCTRMEXPRGMEKOSSNAKDNOKSNDLTRTRVGThis means you can sell and close your positions, but you can't open new positions.Any open orders (such as market orders and limit orders) for these securities were canceled, since they would have resulted in a new open position.

The trident is being sharpened And the three tips are #Nok #Amc #Gme today we go big!
Stocks eventually get to what they are worth. That means over the next few months GME shareholders will lose billions of dollars. Massive amounts of capital will be destroyed. This will eventually go back to 20.
Great!

"NVAX phase 3 results from UK reported last night and it shows that NVAX is the best covid vaccine. Worldwide approval likely starting next week. Why I expect a $1000 price from $NVAX soon! Novavax ($NVAX) is a US-based vaccine manufacturer with a current mcap of $8B. Their main technology is known as Matrix-M and is considered by experts to be the future of vaccines. They have not marketed any of their products so far. Earlier last year they announced a successful trial on a flu vaccine, known as Nanoflu, which is currently considered the best flu vaccine available and will be marketed from next year. However, most of their focus is on a new COVID19 vaccine known as NVX-CoV2373. There are currently four relevant alternatives at approved or advanced stages. The first two are the Pfizer/Biontech which are based on mRNA technology and two more traditional vaccines from Astrazeneca/Oxford. As it stands NVX-CoV2373 is the best vaccine available. For the same strain, Novavax’s efficacy is 95.6%, 95% for Pfizer and 94% for Moderna. Unline the alternatives, Novavax can be stored in normal fridge temperatures which makes it much easier to store and transfer. This will make night and day for developing economies and countries like Australia. It is the only vaccine available proven to work in multiple strains (as it works great with the British strain too) and it is the easiest to accommodate new strains due to the small current dose in ug. The side-effects in the trial were similar to the placebo group. This is the best currently out there.I will explain my personal view on why I think an mcap of $100B (12.5x) makes sense by comparing Novavax with Moderna. There are alternative valuation approaches, but this will give you a good idea of how much undervalued Novavax is. Moderna has a mcap of $65B currently, more than 8x that of Novavax. As soon as they announce successful results and with a delay of a few weeks for approval, the following agreements (with known or expected average pricing of $15/dose):U.S.A. -> 100 Million Doses ($1.5B revenue, part of Operation Warp Speed) U.K. -> 60 Million Doses ($0.9B revenue)EU -> 200 Million Doses ($3 B revenue)Australia -> 50 Million Doses ($0.75B revenue)New Zealand -> 11 Million Doses ($0.165B revenue)Philippines -> 30 Million Doses ($0.46B revenue)Indonesia -> 50 Million Doses ($0.75 Billion revenue)Japan -> 250 Million Doses ($3.75B revenue)Canada -> 76 Million Doses ($1.2B revenue)South Korea -> 40 Million Doses ($0.6B revenue)We have a total of ~876 Million doses corresponding to more than $13B of sales. Covax has an option to buy 450 million doses at $6-8 bringing additional revenues of $3.6B. There are further discussions with India, Africa and other countries, I would estimate a further 450 million doses globally at $7 dollars. The additional revenue would be $3.15B. We end up with an estimate of >$20B revenue in the next 12-18 months for Novavax. More than two times the current market cap. This is unheard for biotech firms. By comparison, do you know what is the revenue projection for Moderna? It is around $10BIn addition to that:- Novavax is likely to have the Nanoflu marketed from next year as well as an RSV vaccine. Nanoflu is expected to bring around $1.5-2B of revenues per year from 2022. - It is also likely to have an annual booster version of the Novavax. Especially if this is combined with Nanoflu in one shot as they expect. Let’s say that they only manage to sell 1Billion Doses of the booster per year (their estimates is 2B though) and at just $8 average price. This would be $8Billion of revenue per year. Based on the above, a simple valuation gives that Novavax would be valued twice that of Moderna. This would give a share price of more than $1,000. Novavax has a mcap of just $8B instead. If it is to reach double the mcap of Moderna, the share price would have to increase by 12.5x. This gives a share price of $1,600. I can cut this down by %30 to end up with a share price of ~$1,100. In the longer term, if Nanoflu is marketed successfully and it is combined with a booster covid shot, we may see much more than this. Novavax is heavily under-priced."
GME CAN HIT 4 digits EASILY IF WE ALL DO NOT HIT SELL BUTTON !!!! ANOTHER NEW HIGH TOMORROW- GET READY LONGS.
JAJAJAJAWait false news and bots.....HOLD
all it took was one phone call from Citadel to Robinhood CEO.
Bought at $300 but still holding 
I don't have any position on this stock but congrats to all you who made money here. Good for you.. It is about time that the regular Joe makes a buck instead of those vulture money managers and hedge funds..
HOLD IT FOR THE GOLD IT
Am I the only one seeing 0% am ??
Is it worth buying GME at $230 hoping it bounces back to $300 or no
let's Gooo BUY AND HOLD !!!
Don’t let them drive the price down before close. Keep buying and holding !!!
So does anybody have a clue on how much outstanding shares are held short other than 140% meaning how high will the stock go is there a mathematical equation for that. If everybody holds would you add on 140%.?
"SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATEHedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON."
"they are not even trying to short ladder, they can literally afford only to pin it lulz"
VXRT now $12++Will easily be $20-$25+next week. Barely 10 minutes left tobuy cheap in Fri AH!!!

Congratulations to all who holds this stock! Little guy needs to win!
I thought you all said this was going to be $1000 today LOL
"It’s on ABC news now, all will know"
CONGRATULATIONS !!!
I hope all shareholders join in a class action lawsuit against the SEC or whoever made the no buy rule on GME. I have never witnesses this ever. Free markets no longer matter. It is okay for HEDGE funds to crush your stock but don't you dare take from these modern day Robbers.
"From WSB:Every single dip is caused by a massive selloff.It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.DeepF##kingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen."
OPEN BELL WILL SEE 400!!!!!
Tomorrow it goes higher or lower?
GME at $357 in Europe now
they can;t keep it down.
And just like that all the shills show up at the same time talkin about how we lost after a massive win. A bit obvious
"Those that can, buy the dips.Those that cannot - HOLD HOLD HOLD.10 more shares.DIAMOND HANDS"
I didn't participate in any of this but one thing I learned from it all is to NEVER open an account with ROBINHOOD OR TD AMERITRADE!
I got nothing to loose. The hedge funders can loose everything. Do the math
Melvin Capital top trader speaks out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcGID8_if-Q Must Watch
"Shares Shorted 120%During an interview on Jan. 25, Brad Lamensdorf, who co-manages the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF HDGE, (which is meant to be used as a hedging tool), said that a percentage of short-sales to total shares available for trading of “over 30% to 40% is outrageously high.”Among the Russell 3000, there were 68 stocks with at least 25% short interest as of the close on Jan. 27, according to FactSet. The data provider uses the total float at of the end of the previous month as the denominator, but the numerator — the number of shares sold-short — is updated twice a month, typically on the 25th day of the month. So the data is rather fresh, and the percentage short for GameStop was down to 120% from 138% only two days earlier, according to FactSet’s data.How can They even cover the 20% above 100% borrowed is my question?Perhaps this is why it will go to the MOON!HOLD EVERYONE!!!And share this!"
fyi..... if you cant trade this stock on any trading platform. here is another opportunity for you.....The vine is ripe....You really want to roast some shorts... Inovio is in an ssr.... Think of having to pay extra to short and cover....glta

"Come on, haven't you short people realised that if we held yesterday & tomorrow, we'll be holding through anything? If this stock can go from $20 to $500, then 650, 700, 900 aren't that far away. With everyday that passes, we get more and more press. Robinhood is already getting sued, retailers have already switched platform, and are just waiting for their funds to be transferred. Do yourself a favour, and be on the right side of history this time."
"Hedge funds are gonna have to sell their shares of microsoft, apple, facebook, nvidia, etc to raise money for their margin calls. this may drive the large indices such #$%$P and Nasdaq down, but the price of GME will rise today."

GME to $5000+ IS NOT A MEME. It is 110% doable especially once the squeeze starts. It's called infinite loss potential people! Keep continuing to hold and retire early. Take back from these hedge funds. Just look at how hard they try to scare us into selling! HOLD THE LINE! GME to $5000+ SQUEEZE HAS NOT EVEN STARTED!

"I’m just curious for all you people bullish on GME and holding till the last short squeeze happens. How do you all plan to sell? Like will everyone a part of WSB support each other in profit taking? Like I applaud all of you who have held and supported one another, but when you all do sell off at whatever price, what happens to the GME supporters who got in at a higher cost basis? And hopefully all of you new investors realize that when you do sell you have to pay short term capital gains, so make sure you save 40% of your winnings for next years tax day. Cause they will come knocking and if you don’t got the money, good luck"
I'm not leaving
Beware of fake PR releases and negative media coverage this weekend/coming week. HOLD THE LINE!!!!
I think GME stocks could become a new world currency
Was there a short squeeze supposed to come by today?
I drank too much last night. Didn't wake up on time. I see there was a dip but I still woke up in the +. Glad I drank too much last night.
Remember this is the dip we saw at VW in 2008 before the big squeeze
Has anybody thought about what is actually required to keep this movement going? Im pretty sure the movement is getting smaller in size in terms of people willing to further. So in order to push it your going to sell your car? second mortgage on the house? momentum dropped today with no spike all day. Id say 50% of people in it are strongly considering getting out monday. realize that the stock could go as high as much as your going to lose? the market will correct. With all due respect good luck to everybody involved in this on both sides. I think truth is sinking in now.
For all the bulls out there. Remember to buy in and hold it as much as you can! It ain’t gonna be easy especially with all the shorties screaming chiken little in these chats.Together we going to the moon!$AAL $ACB $AMC $GME
Should i buy the stocks now or wait for monday morning???

"Ive got no positon in GME and dont know anyone with a position. Honest question. What is stopping the FED, the SEC some major clearing firms anyone with all this Wall Street clout from persuading the GME boad to accept an offer to take the company private at a lower price or to issue shares at a lower price? I have seen both things happen with other stocks in the past being sold for less than current market price and offerings for lower than market price. Some people are saying this is a Lehman type event and I dont think that is correct because the market dropped much shaper on Lehman. Does anyone have any valid reasons something like this could not happen and solve the insufficient share issue?"
"RobinHood, WT actual F1 share limit to buy on GMEThis has to be market manipulation if every I have seen it"
"billions of dollar losses by hedge fund. People like me who think hedge fund always get their way invest against based on value it should really worth take even signficant bigger hit. This mean those fund transfer to winning side. Question is winning side is another hedge fund or retail.So far price movement says large part is retail. If that is case, this stock price will remain high for while. And real support from billionaire like Elon Musk can sure make even higher. Key is asking for support. They have to put billions on this either by willing or forced because Fake support though tweet is not enough."

gonna buy more on any dip
"It also look like yesterday shutdown of stock was pre-planned.Bailout even seem very pre-planned to avoid gamma sequeeze.They basically going to argue that due to lack of money they unable to allow that. Also if they worry about users losing money, why they don't allow excess margin use? Let me guess, they lose Margin interest if they done that before.So it's not in customer interest at all. This is pure planned event including getting user into. They just didn't realize how other hedge fund will trade (Probably assume they able to intepret it correctly) and also Person like Elon Musk and Chamath avoid comment ( While I believe both done for their personal vadetta (Elon Musk who hate short) and Chamath (Who want to be gov of CA) that factor blow on their face badly.Funny (Very serious actually but we all know big boys will get bail out because Fed can't afford any instability) part is, they still played their pre-planned card, which mean this might cause disaster if they didn't."

$1000 is no longer a dream given the gamma squeeze happening today. I would say anywhere between $1000 and $5000 when the short squeeze happens. Look at what happened to VW in 2008. Same thing. Squeeze will go right though next week so the longer you hold the higher the asking price.TLDR HOLD!
You have to be pretty thick to sell this now... it's all over the news lol. Give wall street what they deserve.... HOLD this will be a movie in a few years lol
"Don't be fooled. The reason why Robinhood, Webull and other platforms halt retail traders from buying this and other stocks listed by Wallstreetbets was to allow funds to buy in, so they can build up a position before they crash the stock. Platforms will let retail resume trading buying shares and options at inflated premiums and once they are ready the funds will sell off leaving the retail buyers holding the bags. The halt was to rig the system. So be careful don't put in what you are prepared to lose at this point."

"TODAY IS NOT ENDGAME!!!This steady ride we’ve been on today so far suggests they could very well be waiting for an hour or so before closing bell to start their short ladder attack. A good chunk of their put options of $115 expire today, and if they can tank the price share below that, it’ll be a MAJOR victory for them. The only way this will happen is if we sell our shares. They’re betting we will see this fabricated plummet and sell our shares, enabling them to buy them up and strengthen their dying breaths, giving them one more week to avoid the deathblow.Tim’s to show them that their GAME STOPS here. Hold strong all day!!!This is not financial advice because I am a dummy. I just listen to my nephew, Patrick. He’s 5 years-old and only eats tendies."
"The squeeze is still on.Don’t be fooled they want our shares.We ride this to valhalla, they have no liquidity"

"From r/wallstreetbets user u/DNXPeeJay:MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC $NOK $BB $GME $NAKD It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, in reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all."
People are saying this is worth in excess of 10k per share.... Dont buckle... Hold your line...

"Good afternoon, I am a 25 year old USMC veteran. I'm messaging in hopes of finding legal advice. I invested into GME beginning last Wednesday and have rode it all the way. I had saved a 175c expiring today 1/29. I use robinhood to trade( I KNOW THE WORST ONE OUT THERE) and I had emailed them multiple times today and even reached them through the phone concerning their ""new"" rule with volatile options. I was on the phone with them as GME was plunging( Short ladder attack/Market manipulation) trying to ensure they wouldn't sell MY call that was obviously doing VERY well. Well I firmly believe after my experience, the shorts colluded with brokers as my 175c which had no risk whatsoever was forced to sell at THE LOWEST POINT and now it is of course screaming up. PLEASE help me as I have no idea about the legal side of investing. I was just supporting my favorite childhood store. P.S. If it was about risk why didn't they sell my BB 1/29c first? They picked the least risky and it just so happens the most valuable option in my portfolio."

"The CNBC Shills were doing everything they could today to attack the REDDIT Investors — who may have SAVED GameStop $GME. In my view, the REDDIT Investors should be applauded as HEROS for likely saving GameStop. The back story that CNBC (tight with hedge fund shorts) ignores is that $GME had a 140% of /Float Short Position! ... This is a RED FLAG for illegal naked short selling. It’s supposed to be illegal, right? ... OH MY OH MY —> Wall Street can’t let their DIRTY TACTICS get mainstream attention. What a bunch of FINANCIAL CRIMINALS they are for naked shorting up to a 140% of Float level! ... Shameful! ... They tried to destroy the company via naked short selling! tZERO’s Blockchain Technology would have prevented all of this — if the entire market were forced to have a LEVEL PLAYING FIELD using it... none of this would have happened. TZERO has the BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION !!! —> Look at the tZERO CEO’s tweet. Look at my comments on the $OSTK message board (tZERO has significant minority ownership by OVERSTOCK). There’s a solution to this mess of financial manipulation... and tZERO has applied for it —> and Q4-2021 is the timeframe for approval —> when hopefully they will have the ONLY BLOCKCHAIN TRADING PLATFORM which is “Live & Fully-Regulated” by SEC/FINRA. In Q4-2021, tZERO hopes to gain approval to MERGE onto one program a broad base of digital assets: CRYPTO, DIGITAL SECURITIES & NMS PUBLICLY TRADED STOCKS (all tokenized to enable blockchain tracking at the “atomic level”). Just in case you folks didn’t know —> There is a solution to this madness of short sellers preying on a company. I heard earlier on CNBC... CNBC is now blaming REDDIT Investors for the pullback in the markets! UNBELIEVABLE! Again, the REDDIT Investors should all be applauded as HEROS for all investors — who only want a level playing field! INVEST & HOLD $PLUG $TZROP $OSTK $OSTKO $GME $AMC ... PS: I think the $TZROP 10% of Adjusted Revenues Dividend Paying Token ... could be like winning the “Power Ball Jackpot” once they get approved in Q4-2021 hopefully. REDDIT Investors may be pleased to know that NO SHORT SELLING is currently allowed on the tZERO Markets ATS Platform :) Just open a Digital Account online with tZERO. Happy Investing —> Invest to Win !!!"
How about Robinhood and TD and every other broker puts restrictions on hedge funds tomorrow like they did to retailers today?
the contracts expire today HOLDDDDD
"Nothing matters when contract law is violated willy-nilly by broker dealers. If they can force-sell your position, they can also force-buy an asset before a crash and leave you with a massive debt. Their recent behavior tells me that having an account with these brokerages is a massive liability waiting to happen, and having even 1 position with them opens you up to counterparty risks.I believe that the behavior of the broker-dealers tells me that the ""rule of law"" no longer exists. If you want to own stocks, order the paper copy from your broker as they can no longer be trusted after what transpired today."
"They shorting it, like expected... Hold they will buyback all those shares!"

CARRYING COSTS CHARGES is what eating up the short positions. The longer they hold waiting for the strike price the more they suffer to pay in charges. The longer we HOLD higher the prices go AND the more likely they get margin called and forced to buy at market price.
Why is shorting even allowed?

"$amc $bb $gmeAemetis (NASDAQ: AMTX) in the last 4 days we got 20Mln shares shorted that is almost 100% of total shares (around 21Mln shares) and the float shares are around 14Mln shares. Also considering that some shorts (6Mln shares) have maybe already covered their position, there is again a 14 Mln share that is 100% of total float.Shorting AEMETIS costs +10% year, so people will cover soon their position and price will go up.New projects are also going online that will make this company profitable for the long run."
Rumor is Hedge funds were allowed to re-short this position.
To all them hedge funds: Play with fire get burnt

"Confirmation of what is happening right now: Per S3, “I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added in an email."
I have a question? when will I know when to sellwhen someone of authority or institution who already sold their shares says the shorts have covered won’t there be a mass selling by us and the price will go from $400 to $10 in minutes like what happened the other day $400 to $112 and that wasn’t mass selling I think I should get out now before the mass selling starts
Patience and hold. Even if it's over the weekend. They will have to pay up

"told ya, this is going UP tonite and pre market!"
Congrats!!! You guys have made billions for the institutions holding this stock. Holders like Black Rock have seen their positions grow to almost $3B. Great job sticking it to man. They are laughing all the way to the bank.
When the hammers of justice come upon the likes of Robinhood. All shareholders of GME will be entitled to the class action as they have no right to manipulate or restrict trading of shares of a company an individual is a shareholder and as a consequence causing material damages to said company and its legal owners & shareholders. End of story. HOLD no matter what.

"Why do you think there is a lot more negativity here now, and posts about other stocks (distraction), and unrelated garbage? They are paid spammers from hedge funds to divert attention away.

But today is a new day, today we HOLD, today we wait out the storm, today we create the wall there is no escape for these greedy ##$%$ Today we HOLD!!!!!!"
"I think the brokers planned a zoom call this morning and then agreed to temporary cut off the purchase of new shares which dropped the price. After it fell to $120 they swallowed up all the shares today on that dip and then as soon as the price went back up they changed the restriction. Well of course they did. It doesn't sound right, they screwed retail traders today! We shouldn't let them get away with this!"

Is there dividend in this stock? better get out before everyone sells for dividend payout next week for all the better companies
"The tale of GameStop’s (GME) meteoric rise, its chaotic decline, and what happens next with the role of retail traders in the market, are narratives that have dominated the conversation this week. Been watching stocks like this. Found a service that tells me buys and sells. https://daytradingsquad.team/TTG-Instant-Access"
"Here's a MAJOR problem. The people who run things want everyone to judge companies/stocks like they do. That is how they have made their money, short or long. GME retailers have disrupted things.

"""Analysts"" and ""experts"" on CNBC say we are not following the fundamentals, that these trades are not based on any fundamentals, blah, blah, blah.. well, guess what, fundamentals dictate short bets need to be closed, fundamentals dictate ITM options will be exercised... fundamentals dictate naked shorts are risky AF, yet HF did it anyway, knowing the risks... redditors are following all the rules made by the powers that be, redditors are the ones shafted by trading limits, redditors are follow all rules and fundamentals and YET painted as disruptive. Disruptive to what? Disrupting HF from ""business as usual"", volatility? HF increased short bets and all is good? That's fine? Come on!!"
"Kind of funny that AOC, Ted Cruz and others are on the same note about regulating billionaires about trading. Its funny because it will ultimately regulate the little traders because becoming a billionaire is why retail traders trade in the first place."
bwhahaha you think it is just reddit on the opposite side bears??? DEAD wrong. big whales smell blood and are buying to destroy citadel. did you not see that massive buy at 3:15 PM today to push this to $320? a guess where the share price closes...perfectly at $325...exactly at vwap to inflict MAX pain on call writers. no one can pull that kinda of stuff off except for big whales like a black rock or vanguard who both have significant stake in gme. don't kid yourself and think it is only a bunch of rag tag college kids buying 1 to 2 shares at a time on the opposite side of the trade as the shorts. big whales know shorts are screwed and are going to destroy them for billions.

"Webull CEO Anthony Denier was interviewed by Yahoo finance and claimed the reason his company and Robinhood stopped retail investors from buying GME is because it takes 2 days to settle a trade and it is costing them a lot. And he goes on by saying but they let trader sell the stock. Two problems with this; first of all, If the market is floated with sell order, it makes the stock crash and that is what exactly what they were trying to do. Second of all, doesnt it take take two days to settle a sell order as well. . Guys without us the retail investors, the liquidity of stock market can dry up. So we have power and whenever Citron Resarch, Andew Lef posts negative news about a stock, ignore it. He has made a lot of money by fabricating financial materials, lying to the public. He needs to go bankrupt. He has made many small investors lose their life savings, all for the benefit of one person. It is our turn to take him down."

No one needs to F'N care WHY I do anything. I could have bought this stock b/c i threw a MF dart on my wall, I have my reasons, and I am not an analyst nor do I make financial advice.

Restricting trading will only make people more angry. THE MAN can't win this one. GME will go to 1000
Robinhood prevented people from buying GME. They're obviously in bed with Wall Street hedge fund goons. If you have money in Robinhood pull it out and go to another trading company. There are many. Probably take you a day to get your new account funded / up and trading again.Do not allow Robinhood to manipulate what stocks you can buy.Hedge funds have already lost $$ billions $$ on GME alone. Keep the pressure on..... Crush 'em until nothing is left but ashes !Think of GME as Thor's Hammer !
WHAT AN EPIC RESPONSE. PEOPLE POWER!
"A legendary action what happened here. But don’t forget to also sell while you are up. This company will not necessarily have the best future coming ahead, unless they can now also use this momentum for a substantial capital raise for a compete overhaul."
What’s interesting would be if GameStop reaches a certain market cap it will be potentially in a position to do some strategic acquisitions completely changing the dynamics of the existing company.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday criticized the decision of online trading platform Robinhood to restrict retail trading in shares of GameStop and other companies that have seen dramatic gains this week attributed to social-media driven trading.Ocasio-Cortez said the move was “unacceptable,” adding Congress needs to know more about Robinhood’s decision “to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.”She said the House Financial Services Committee investigation should not be limited to Robingood but “should examine any retail services freezing stock purchases in the course of potential investigations - especially those allowing sales, but freezing purchases.”"

"Stay Strong on Monday Stooges...... The way I look at it, that means 72-58 = $14M of the squeeze has already been squozen, and that's a big part of what made today's GME price is as high as it is. But there's still $58M left to go as long as WSB and long-holders stay strong. 14 / 72 = 19.4% squozen."
Just think about all those call options contracts expiring in the money. All those shares need to be bought from somewhere!

"James - you seem to be the main (only) short here. Will this fall back to 40, 80. Unlikely100, 150.... maybe Squeeze to 450, 500 possiblySqueeze to 600, 1,000 unlikely but who knowsBullish catalyst- stock opens higher monday from global buying of even small accounts and cost to borrow is high Bearish catalyst - company announces share offering. They may not be allowed as in quiet period. If they find a way, it could dip , then rally as even a discounted 20 million offering would raise billions (not needed given 800 million debt and no near term problems) be bought up (buy longs and shorts- still short over 50 mm shares. Capital raise and falling share price would ultimately lead to Ryan Cohen taking over the company which mgt doesn’t want. So downside is 100-150 (saw that on manipulation Thu), upside is 450-600 (maybe 1,000) where regulators step in and halt stock for 7-10 days and face revolt. Understand, at 20 bn mkt cap, a 50% increase is 10 bn more losses for Wall Street plus addtl losses on options (market to market and some other billions of it stays up) ==== so Yes, this effects the ENTIRE MARKET There at 15-17 Billion in losses somewhere with potential to be 25 billion or more losses if it rises another 50% or more."

If you love America lets show them!
"The Senate Finance Committee, which provides oversight for the SEC, appears to be doing their jobs and having none of this nonsense about ""sources"" (aka $2000/hour ex-SEC attorneys who work for funds) talking about the SEC investigating retail longs buying 5 and 10 and 20 shares at a time because they like the stock.Wall Street has a problem. Retail longs do not.Grow up, pick up the phone, call the GME board, do a follow-on offering, and settle this like a middle class adult, guys.More bear raids means longs buy more.Shutting down buying means longs transfer stock certificates to other brokers.Media ""sources"" about SEC enforcement investigating 4mm retail investors for buying stock merely raises the ire of both conservatives and liberals in congress-- from AOC to Ted Cruz.Next time, don't greedily short more than all stock outstanding down at $10/share. To be clear, there were 70mm longs who lent their stock out-- who would have bought the stock at $10/share and allowed GME to raise $700mm in capital for a turnaround strategy. But GME couldn't raise capital at that price because the shorts showed up, borrowed their stock, and shorted it. Had GME been able to raise capital at that price, maybe they wouldn't be shutting down 1000 stores and putting a bunch of people out of work. Now they can raise capital at a much higher price, and shorts are unhappy.Sorry guys, but that's capitalism.Pick up the phone, call the board, and cover your short position with a follow-on offering. Or keep doing short attacks and blocking investors from buying-- we'll figure out a way to buy more. Or keep calling your $2000/hour lawyers and attracting more Senate Finance Committee attention to yourselves. I don't know. You're adults with billions of dollars in capital. You figure it out. Maybe you stop doubling down and handle this like middle-class adults-- admit you have a problem, and ask for help. You help GameStop with it's turnaround strategy, GameStop helps you and prints you shares to get out of your short position."
REMEMBER 2008. REMEMBER 2001 WHEN THEY PRAYED OFF THE FALLEN CIVILANS OF 9/11. IT'S NOT GOING TO END WELL THIS TIME.
call your broker and ask what will happen with options if GME will close above $150 today ... bonuses in literaly thousands of percents. MM will have to buy tons of shares on open market...
I think we retail investors need to stay strong and find the next short and stick it to them... shorting a stock is not investing... let these guys get stuck... they are hammering down American business. They are leaches that need to learn a lesson....
OHHHHH YESSSSSS!!!ROBINHOOD TO ALLOW TRADING OF GME TOMORROW!!!!
I just got done filing my complaint with the SEC. (SEC.gov). For market minipulation for shutting down the ability of retail investors to buy shares artificially deflating the price. I recommend we all file complaints
Looks like all of Melvin 's employees finally left the office after a week long of sleeping at the office and spamming lol they won't ever have to go back
"This cannot be reduced simply to a ""pump and dump."" It is an absolutely cinema-worthy crushing of the regular people by Wall Street bigs who got the brokerages to stop the regular people from opening positions (and in some cases, trading in general) in GME and other stocks. If the regular people don't do something about this almost immediately, Wall Street will have cemented their chokehold on the regular people for quite a long time to come."

"Here is how to hold the stock: watch closely how many shorts are trapped in it. Melvin is still trapped in it, contrary to its lie on Tuesday. In order to stay short with the same number of shares, it must inject more money. The money comes from point72 and citadel. Injecting more money is equivalent to averaging in. On the wrong side, averaging in is fatal. But it's too late to back out. That's why point72 and citadel had to inject billions more into Melvin. The more they inject, the deeper they get trapped. As long as they are trapped, we hold. Theoretically, there is no upper limit in price, could be 1000, or 3000."

"Ameritrade just credited me 500 bucks for transferring my account last month, going all into GME at the open to help the cause. Might even throw some of my own money in. Can’t let them get away with what they did today."
Volume way better than yesterday and still restrictions everywhere lol. This is going to the moon for sure
GME opens at $500
Let's turn this into the next $GME
Just Bought 1 share and I’m holding. Stay Strong my friends.
What do you guys say about Jim Cramer this morning on the phone w/Carl Quitinilla said the the Reddit crew should now sell - because they've done it ! They hit the home run ! Now they should sell.What say you ?
"oh boy, bought 2 more. it's all I could do"
So let me get this straight...robinhoodie hunt with margin???Dudes ... luv you but .. gme and others should only.be bought with your own money... in other words... If robinhood let u buy margin such a stock .. than he is not robinhood ..He just be robbery hood boy

After hours means nothing!
"Bye bye Robinhood, you’re not leading us Merry Men any more!"
This is the way.
MOON TOMORROW!!!!
"Its a shame we can't get some of the merry men to take a break from $GME and help us push those shorts out at 2. Would probably be able to push the ones out at 8, if they did :-)"
Going back up..
Many are buying GME to make money. Many are buying on principles. I'm buying for both... so I will at least bat .500
"I don't own any shares of $GME, but I wouldn't want to be long going into the weekend. There is too much of a risk that $GME starts tanking on Monday. Anyone else agree with this?"
"So it's OK for hedge funds to short this stock to make money for their clients, but not good for retail investors to push the stock price, so we all make money, is this really fair play??"
"Focus on two stocks at a time. Don’t spread your money out at this point. Don’t put it all in but what you will put in, put in GME and AMC. Let’s crush the shorts in these first."
Who is still holding $450's LOL
"The hedge funds that still short this have to buy, if they have executed puts that day is today. They will be waiting when to exercise their option and could happen anytime!"
"On top of the FINRA write your congress person.. In a world which Ted Cruz and AOC both agree on the same thing, that is the winning side.. $AMC $GME $KOSS $BB $BBBY $NAKD"
Should i but when it opens? And why. Is it too late for me to join in?
HOLD !!! BUY DIPS!!
To the moon!
My friends are feeling tired holding this stock...not sure if the stress and trauma is worth it.
HOLD THE LINE. Melvin is starting his ladder attack. I like this stock
We did it!!!!!
"it will be down today after hours like yesterday, and will be up tomorrow just hold"
If your broker allows put in limit orders. You can pull the trigger on a buy or sell at a price you like. With all the volatility of this stock likely at some point in the day you’ll reach the price you like. this is much better than using market orders that can be manipulated buy buying lower or selling higher than it needed to be where the difference will be pocketed by the trader and not you. I’m giving ya’ll pearls here.
When will we know that they covered their position? Or maybe they did already? Someone explain plz
"This reminds me of back in the late 90s and the wild trading like Amazon. People bought, the stock was run up only to be dumped the next day. Who was compensated for their loses then?"
"SRNE is one of the stocks more shorted in the market plus a promising pipeline.... if this is the next $GME , the sp will explode!"
A drop is coming... Stay strong....hold
One share forever
Tomorrow shorts suffer!!!!!
LMAO at talking heads on CNBC!!  They are scared!!! Kudos to Mr. Wonderful . . . he is on the side of the little guy!!! Cramer sold us out!!
Buy buy buy!!!!
"I think  once the shorts have been covered, it will be David vs David.Imho at that point you wouldn’t want to be holding this stock, imho.It will collapse imho...soon"
I use to spend a lot of time in GameStop and also purchased my collection of fnko there! I’m in on both and not selling!!!!!
"We should be unite to protect each other from shorters and hedgesShould support $GME, $AMC, $PLTR, $NOK, $KOSS to get back to their positions.If you are Retailer like me, Support us. It will be for Better Future.Support us buy buying and Holding these shares"
"Shorts and paid bears don't understand this position.This stock is more like a house than a stock.We bought it, we paid for it, we own it. We intend to occupy it. We don't care if black people move into the neighborhood or if the price will go down tomorrow. It's our house.Stop trying to scare us into selling you strange people."
You all have guts. All or nothing like this. I can’t do it. My money is in cash and bonds until things make sense again. I’m enjoying watching it tho!!
You kids know the market is closed till Monday right ? My god rookies
buy and hold we are winning...
"if you never spoke up against the censorship coming from social media and even defended them and yet now have been complaining against Robinhood, you deserve to lose everything"
My brokerage wont let me buy. What a joke.
Retailers holding hedge funds hostage. It’s not going down til they cover.
Thank you Melvin. That lil dip helped me average down now.
"HERE YOU GO READ IF YOU ARE HAVING DOUBTS NOW ***COPY AND PASTE THIS IN FORUMS****. From r/wallstreetbets user u/DNXPeeJay:MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC $NOK $BB $GME $NAKD It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, in reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all."
My son said all his friends were trying to by GME yesterday so don't sell
Hold over the weekend folks! Fireworks Monday morning!
The saddest fact is I could not short 100 shares at $400...Thats criminal too
"The short squeeze on Volkswagen on 27–28 October 2008 caused Volkswagen's mkt cap to blast off to the moon! VW is not my first choice...I rather drive a Toyota or a Tesla. Speaking of which, Tesla’s mkt cap is about $800b. Tesla was the most shortd stock in 2020. The dollar value of all shorted Tesla shares was about $20 billion. No US stock in history has ever been that shorted. VW. Tesla. Now, $GME??"
Any hedge fund trading in GME this week should lose their licenses and principals should go to Jail. Robinhood should be Confiscated to pay damages to traders that were unbelievably denied today!!!!!
"I don't care what happens with the AMC stock, but I do know I will never have a Robinhood account ever after what occurred the last 2 days."
"in again at 290 & 260$ with orders below at 220$ & 190$Come on Gamers keep it up, close near to 300$ and the squeeze can start next week"

"If you’re still holding, you’re part of the APE brotherhood, together will rise and give the 1% a black eye. They wouldn’t be limiting trades on certain platforms if they weren’t SCARED TO DEATH. Don’t sell, payoff is tomorrow."

How many share short seller have to cover tomorrow? Can someone get status of shorts?
"On Monday at noon if this stays above 300.00, the hedge fund will have to begin buying shares."
Get em guys. When this halt gets lifted it's gonna print $500
"As always, the CEO's of the corporate state are now trying to silence people by deleting Facebook accounts and negative reviews on Google. Communism and corporatism aren't much different."
Optical drives removed from Consoles what happens to GME. I hope the buyers of GME realize it will drop back to 9 dollars a share or so. Trade it maybe but long term holding not smart
"This is shorts trying hard to make sure the 200k in options aren't in the money tomorrow, the short % is even higher now. HOLD. FK THE FUNDS"

I'm going to buy ps5 at Gamestop first and foremost with my gains
I will be shocked if robinhood is in business by years end
"The plan was HOLD till friday or after, that what Im doing"
"So Im just an average Joe reading the Reddits, chiming in on the discords, and praising all of you for doing this. But if I wanted to buy a share.... is it going to be an outrageous price? Is it pointless to buy just 1 share now?"
"GameStop And Bitcoin Have Similarities In That They Both Are Involved In Selling Lines Of Code. The only real difference is that Bitcoin has ZERO ""assets"" and that GameStop actually has some assets. So now you go figure out how selling lines of code to people can cause a Bitcoin tyo gain a market cap of $800 BILLION at one point. Do I want to see GME shares going close to $42,000.00 each share? I don't care. But if a Bitcoin, that is worth nothing, can go there how about a company with some assets, that also it selling lines of code in the form of games? They could also just announce that their stock is now going to become a cryptocurrency since it is doing so well. Now wouldn't that be ""special""?"
"Market Movers engaging in illegal activity? Hedge funds could buy and sell, but on many platforms, retail investors could only sell. Lawsuits?"
Ignore after hours nonsense.Monday will be EPIC.
how they buy if robinhood has blocked this stock?
"Congrats to the Redditers, you forced your ""representatives"" in Congress to finally admit that Wall Street elites are corrupt and that their heavy handed approaches through Robin Hood and other small investor brokerages were both illegal and improper and that the same restrictions were not applied to the large Hedge Funds. Also you were able to break Robin Hood from improperly restricting your access to the markets and finally you forced probably the worst of the worse of shorts who is famous for crafting in many cases false narratives about companies meanwhile shorting these companies from publicly publishing anymore attack articles, that company is Citron. Wins on all three counts."
"GME AMC NOK just mentioned on fox business""It's about censorship we are tired of it"" FarceBook and TWEEEETERHOLD THE LINE!"
Any chance we’re going back to $400 tomorrow?
"$GME $AMC brokers are limiting trading on these stocks, what a joke. trying to keep retail investors from profiting! Check out $ZOM, no limits on trading. getting ready to break out. do some DD, you won't be disappointed."
A lot of people opening brokerage accounts! They won’t be able to trade until Monday when their funds ara available to trade. HOLD!!

"Everyone continue to HOLD YOUR SHARES! The squeeze has not even started yet! They will try to scare you over the weekend into selling but don't fall it. See between the lines! Have a great weekend! GME to $10,000+ is not a meme"
"so...as soon as this ""rumor"" was heard on wall street, say around the $30 level...wouldn't the big funds have caught on and invested heavily to the point where it would no longer be profitable?...the volume implies they are involved."
I tried to link the website but it was continually deleted.
ahahahahaha...only 2 times average volume. Bahahahahah.....no sellers.

This is how rigged the markets are with the hedge funds.Easy short ladder then pump.
If you're still on RH you need to transfer your shares to a new platform IMMEDIATELY. They won't let you buy more than 5 shares. It's not difficult. Do it now and add what you can!

PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price.

Congrats. The original short busters have won and made their point and a ton of cash. Nothing more american then that . BUT now Hedge funds are making a ton of money on this now. Do you think they are going to sit by and let these swings go by and not make huge money? They are buying out of the money calls and you guys are bidding them up thinking you're hurting shorts. You are being used now.
Lol they are using multiple halts and trading restrictions to drive the price down and give the shorts time at a lower priceClear market manipulation. If you can buy and hold do it now!!

"Robinhood obviously is SLOW to evolve. If your costs rise once volatility rises in an equity, than let your buyers absorb those costs and let them trade freely.

Changing of the rules may cause the markets to crash as retail liquidates all of their positions completely. I do not think the brokers should have created restrictions today. I missed out on the entire run and have been watching from the sidelines. They should have allowed things to naturally work themselves out.

"Credit u/PlayFree_BirdOkay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and #$%$ retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants#$%$ fear.4. Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6oIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.Edit1: ???Edit2: I wish I was Elon's adopted asian childEdit3: we like the stockFull Casino?

The fat cats are probably trying to lawyer up already! Blood in the water.Buy and hold!!
"One way to make money on these big swings: when it’s high, enter a bull call spread. For example: Say the price is $340. But a combination of one call at $310, and sell one at $320. You’ll pay $5 to 7. If it goes up, fine - you make tidy profit. If it plummets, buy the $320 back, but hold onto the $310. When the stock jumps back up again, sell another $320 call to assume the original position again."
Youre already making money if you bought at peak of open!
Buy now and tomorrow gamma squeeze till $999

GME price is still holding after market even though there is a weekend ahead. Which is a very good sign. I believe that there is still scope for the short squeeze to continue next week - may be much smoother.
Why not timing the next buy? if everybody buys just a couple of shares at exactly 16.15 this should give a huge boost.

"As a long term $VFF investor, I feel conflicted about the entire $GME ordeal. Like the latter, we were the victim of Citron and other short sellers which adversely affected the shares. We believed in this great company and suffered through sleepless nights of bizarre yet unscrupulous market manipulation.With that said, as the offspring of someone who grew up on the other side of the Iron Curtain, I am a fervent capitalist. As such, I dont think Citron or the banks or the MMZs did anything illegal. On top of that, the share price going down coincided well with my life stage, as I am still young and the constant trading down gave me the unique opportunity to accumulate more shares of a company I know and understand and believe in at a discounted price. So yeah, I'm just feeling weird and conflicted about the whole thing as a long term VFF investor. Even as a long, I've come to both hate and love the shorts. I still feel confident in this stock, but I'm neither excited nor worried about a short squeeze. It just feels odd for the rest of the world to see what us long term Villagers have already experienced day to day for years and years. GLTA!"

"GME STOCK INPORTANT INFOMelvin capital starts covering TODAY ( FRIDAY), it will take them at LEAST 4 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic. No need to worry about . It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!"

"Fizz is the mother of all shorts.... The CEO holds 76% of all the shares and he will not sell. 83% of the float is short with no way out. Game has been amazing, but I am turning me attention to Fizz for next week. AH was already up big time after the Friday profit taking. Shorts have to cover soon... Who knows how high this goes. There is also a approved share split from the BOD that can be announced anytime. I am going all in on this one, then betting on OMER for the long term with a heavy short in the short term pushing it higher, but the pipeline extends it much longer. Let the big short hedge funds burn. They have been playing us for years...... finally get beat at there own game. taking from the Rich and giving to the poor. David and goliath. You have to love the justice in it all."
There is nothing like being able to change the rules of a game if you start losing. This is exactly what Wall Street has done. Period!
Hey I understand you guys are peeved at hedge funds. But when is someone going to clawback all the money Cramer lost for folks over the last 20 years?
Hold them shares boys and girls. You'll know when the squeeze hits.

If someone is not in a position with GME then why would they come here commenting to sell? YOU'RE NOT PERSUADING ANYONE TO SELL!!! HOLD!!!! BUY MORE MONDAY!
That's what you get for trying to take away our freedoms

"Buying here in Canada. Keep this going. Can't stand watching these Wall Street analysts cry about how this price action is manipulative. That is exactly what they do day in and day out. Stay strong, buy this fabricated dip. If this is short action driving the price down we have the chance to hit them again."
"Shorting is not evil. Shorts actually analyze and read income statements. Many a time shorts brought sanity back to back to trading when they rooted out scam companies. GME per balance sheet is worth how much? $10-20 per share maybe. Don't blame the shorts for corporate mismanagement. It's corporate management, or lack thereof, that brought this company to where it is. Shorts just like longs look for investment opportunities. No amount of pumping this thing will ultimately solve corporate mismanagement. If management was smart they would have sold part of their 20% at these lofty prices and used that capital for restructuring. But would they? In the meantime buy stocks and pump them high. It's a long and fast journey down."
hello. I just heard about this and thinking about going long .. usually this means it's at or near the top. .. for what ever that's worth...
Bought 50k guys!
Wouldn't be surprised if we saw a bunch of Robinhooders flood from $GME and $AMC crowd this stock this morning... :-/
You cant talk this down
So... if 2million options were supposed to be exercised today.. why hasn't the stock price reflected this?
Your democracy is at stake here get out of robinhood and jump to another broker.
buy & hold !
Get yelling at your broker on the phone if they won’t allow buysIn the meantime hold and weather the halts. They are desperate!
Am I wrong here If you own the shares write call options deep in the money and get all the money up front and let them buy the option from you at a premium Some one with a stronger brain at this time of night please explain. Thanks 
Power Hour soon
Hold the line!!! These mass sell-off schemes won't work
Who bough at 400s ?
this is strong buy. Also call your brokers and file formal complain.
Stop using Robin hood or interactive brokers. They are in collusion with market makers.

"Just curious, what happens if those with the Short positions declare bankruptcy?"
It's funny if GME goes down market go up and if GME go up market go down. So we did make them pay badly. But we have to hold. Once we wipe them out and get that $2000 stimulus ( I don't get but many of you do and should get) we get cheap market to moon.

i just bought 500 million shares to support the cause!!!! Go Team!!
All these short funds are going banko or running for the hills as their clients pull 10s of billions from their funds which causes more short covering to pay clients their refunds! In most cases 30 to 50 % less than they invested!Fact!
WE DID IT!!!!!
"Robinhood should go out of business. You live in America, in a capitalist market economy. The motor and strength of the economy is in the buying and selling between people, between everyone over any product. How dare they restrict what you can buy or when you can buy especially as ultimately it's what keeps the economy moving and growing. As you can see by their disgraceful undignified behavior, CUTTING YOU OFF FROM BUYING IS ALL ABOUT THE ANXIETY THEY HAVE ABOUT STAYING RICH AND GETTING RICHER. WHEN THEIR MONEY GOES DOWN THEY GET ANXIOUS ABOUT PAYING THE MORTGAGE ON THEIR 3RD LUXURY HOUSE. If you have a Robinhood account you should close it and open one with Schwab, Fidelity, so many others. They all offer free or very very low fees on trading and they don't restrict what you can buy. I'm in Fidelity and have never had a problem."
WE LIKE THIS STOCKLike if you agree.
"Take a look at the GME chart from Yahoo Finance. About 70 million shares of stock in GME exist and about 62 million of those have been sold short! To make things more interesting, the Float, which represents the shares that are available for trading, is only around 47 million. This means the owners of the shorts will need to buy back 1.5 times more shares than are available to buy."
Robinhood and other brokerages restricting trading in GME is cheating the little guy.
"Like I said... nice warm up GME this morning.. I am not sure if anyone got out... after seeing the big drop to 200. But, I am holding.. we see 500$ by 10:00am today... unless GME/SEC interfere, no one can stop this.. .SCREW the SHORTIES who shorted this stk at 400 yesterday... ONCE MORE"
Just HOLD !!!!! Hedge funds got caught with their pants down finally!!!!just HOLD They will be forced to throw $BILLIONS to this & you will be rich !!!!!!!
"“Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow LIMITED buys of these securities. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed,” Robinhood said in a statement."
"I’m want to be part of this, I’m with you guys. Only 1% of my portfolio but I will not sell."
My suspicion is citadel got in robinhood's ear and said they weren't going to front-run for them any more unless robinhood cut off the retail purchases.
I wonder if Robinhood hired anybody to guard H.Q.? I can see some violence coming.
It's over for all shorts tomorrow
"Everyone tweet every platform asking Elon buy GME. He has to show support. There is nothing wrong buying stock to show support for your followerHis follower give him $200B and make him world richest. Reason stock gone 300 because of his earlier Game stonk comment. He has to take stand. Weather he has to go though SEC trouble again, it does not matter. If he does not people know his true intent very soon and he will lose everything."
Some big guys double down still with huge short position; Hold it for $600 or even $1000!
Is anyone rationale on this board anymore or are people just trying to make profits? A brick and mortar video game store (even assuming they weren't bankrupt) for $300/share?

"Let's be real. This is a very dangerous Ponzi scheme that does not end well. Seems like most everyone here understands that. This bending of reality has the potential to cause large financial damage to thousands of people wagering on this stock who are either buying the stock, shorting the stock or playing the options game. The largest problem with this whole Ponzi scheme is that it completely flies in the face of economics or Company valuation. It seems we have all lost sight of what capital markets were created for: To provide capital to companies to grow. People choose where to invest their hard earned money in order to provide the capital to help companies grow and prosper. If an investor makes a wise choice, then the investor should earn a nice return on their investment. What is going on here is not investing. This is simply gambling that is going to hurt far too many people. However, this complete delusion has shined a very bright light on the need for serious new rules and regulations on these runaway Hedge Funds shorting large amounts of a company's stock or selling unlimited amounts of naked options. We all need to get back to reality. Rules need to be fair for everyone.Just for fun, a few ideas that could certainly help us quickly get back to reality, if anyone was willing to get a bit out of the box:1) If a stock price appreciates 150% in a 10 day trading period, then insiders are provided a 24 hour window to sell their shares or buy more shares before the stock ""moons"" or ""mars"" to 1000 or 5000. 2) Provide the Company the ability to immediately issue new shares up to 15% of outstanding shares at market price. New stock to be sold by a brokerage trust with all proceeds going to the company as new capital for growth.3) The Company should quickly find a good long term partner interested in the success and future of the Company and its employees and sell the Company at the best possible price now.If any of these ideas or a variety of these concepts were implemented, what would be your evaluation of the actual value of the Company's stock? Highly probable the gaming ends and we quickly find the real stock price fast. There is plenty of fault to go around on the making of this huge Ponzi, but this complete breach of reality must be stopped now and in the future. This reality show has most certainly proven that the system needs some fixing.Let's fix this and get back to investing."
I am following my son’s lead on this investment - says we are making history. Hold till Monday!!

"WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR YOU GUYS!!! ......My wife who never invested in anything had the urge to invest a few hundred in AMC stocks yesterday.

Any words of encouragement from you guys for her?....."

Pin this.This is price manipulation by hedge funds selling the stock to each other everybody on WSB is holding because we have already seen these kind of attacks. Hold your line the short float is still 138%. All these people here are bots/people who don’t own nothing and are just sour.

"Ten years ago, a bunch of college kids set up tents in Zucotti Park to occupy Wall Street and beat bongo drums.This was denounced by some as an illegal occupation, and they may have had a point about camping and being a nuisance and public health risk beyond a certain point. But they did have a right to be upset on some level, too.Today, a bunch of capitalist retail investors have legally purchased and hold an unmortgaged title to 70mm shares. This is a similar occupation, but it's completely legal, moral, and ethical. We own the stock. We hold title to it. It's ours, we paid cash, and we're not selling it. Hedge funds are pssd, because they're not supposed to lose money-- only retail is supposed to lose money! Sucks for them. This is capitalism."

The slim bags responsible for locking out retail investors from buying $AMC & $GME need to be brought to justice. Just because you are losing doesn’t mean you can take the ball and change the rules.

I bought GME at $208 in after hours. It is as of 11:40am $328 Sounds wonderful to me. I buy on drastic downturns. Works for me! I am note bullish or bearish. I follow the moment!
"I am not a fan of social media at its base level, nor have I ever invested nor did I ever invest in GameStop, though I do find it very objectionable that Wall Street is doing everything in its power to stop this ""grass roots movement"" and unless someone can prove otherwise not Chinese or Russian money involved though I suspect there is some invested, I have to assume by all rights these are legal and transparent trades. Yet hedge funds can blindly short stocks and buy puts that ""manipulate"" the prices of these companies to tank at their discretion, costing small retail investors billions of dollars of their hard earned money. I know for a fact that many of these hedge funds and large financial banks work in coordination with each other to manipulate prices. I do not see how this is even remotely Constitutional or in any way a violation of any SEC or NYSE or NASDAQ rules. It is merely an attempt by the uber wealthy to keep the middle class in their place just like they did by shutting down the conservative voice on social media. This is unacceptable and its Washington DC's responsible to rectify this."

Shorts are not squeezed yet. Those hedgies want you to think it is being squeezed now. DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR TRAPS!
"Citron DID NOT close their shorts! Don’t believe the news, you can literally find this by looking up their positions. Media and multiple brokerages that sells trade data to Citron (such as Robinhood) are all in the same team. They are over short by a mile, hold the shares and let them burn!"

"Buy Buy Buy! It’s going to 1000 tomorrow!,!,!,!,,! Get rich next 24 hours! FOMO is a real on GME!"

I would never trade on robinhood after this! What corruption!
"why dont those brokers just close our accounts and give our money to the shorts, be more direct about it"
Limited access to the stock makes it scarce and more expensive! So much demand but limited supply! Hold it!
Short interest is still 122% the real squeeze is yet to happen
GME should do I stock offering and use the funds to build out an esports league. They have a database of gamers unparalleled by its competitors. If they did this the stock would probably pop and allow the company to monetize an even higher stock price. Just my two cents. Not in the stock. Just think the media is not appreciating that GME could turn the ship around. It’s wasn’t that long ago that GME was doing $500 million annually in free cash flows
Guys should i buy at that price?!!
Look how mad the shorts are lol
HOOLD!! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD!! This video explained a lot of things for me! Thought I would share  https://youtu.be/cYTDNoWPyOI
"On the back of GameStop stock increasing tenfold in just seven days and the continued investments in short-sell stocks, financial data analytics firm Ortex has estimated that short-sellers have lost $70.87 billion on their investments. The company made this calculation through data collected from agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers...... ...Just read this let's tighten the screws even more...."
"1billion in volume every day? Thus thing is practically SCREAMING buy me, im worth MORE THAN YOU KNOW! if it goes to 2 dollars (Zack Morris Twitter group price target) it could continue up from the momentum. Not saying it will happen. But man with this kind of volume day after day after day... just screams parabolic runner. Going to make headlines you better get your piece of the pie before it happens or get left behind like $GME"
get a real brokerage acct not robinhood. precise fills is 100% of the battle
"I know the stock price will probably stay relatively higher until the opening unlike the price stayed low around $18 earlier so that these shorts will eat up the FLOL (front-line of longs). They want to test our strengths. I said I'll go all in with call options ITM. I don't care I'd love to own more $AAL shares. Had the trading not been $GME crazy, I would have waited next week since the price retreated in the following week after quarterly results in the previous two quarters."
"Wonder who is the one manipulating the market now...Blocking platforms, halting every 5 seconds."
THE 99% STANDS STRONG!!! TOMORROW WE HIT $500 (if not by EOD lol)
Does it help if we have Sell Limit orders out for as high as we can?
Holding
Do you have any idea the enormous amount of stock that was sold short $100 higher today?You're fighting against big money again and they don't lose twice.About to drive the price down to $10.
btw Fidelity is allowing GME trades
Well done my army of deplorables! I'm still holding my 110 shares!! Way to hold and push for a great push into the close....the moon is near!
the only way they get my shares is BK ..diamond hands .. my money is my money
If no one sells and no restriction on buying-it be most epic short squeeze of stock market history

"""Andrew Left’s Citron Research said it will discontinue offering short-selling analysis after 20 years of providing the service.

What happens when you don't have shares to replace the shares already sold
Why would Robinhood ban any stock and enrage traders? Don't they want that nice pop on the IPO? The little guys should sit that one out.
this is better than watching GOT season finale!!!
Can someone explain why the stock is stagnant and not moving?
"Think about what has been done this week!! All that we have accomplished! We have sent a message to wall street and the big guys calling the shots that we are not to be trifled with!!! Robin hood blocking out millions of investors from buying stocks like $GME $NAKD $AMC $SNDL will not be forgotten!!! Good work everyone, you can all say you were apart of this movement. Keep fighting the good fight."
"What if the shorts don't ever buyback the shares? Can they claim bankruptcy and hide their money? Who will by our shares, anyone?"

Who is selling? Probably still people shorting GME. Just out of pure curiosity i won't sell my shares just to see what can happen.
"Whether it is Gold or Bitcoin (smart play is both) take at least what you put in off the table and into there. It's where most will run as this chaos creates more uncertainty in the market.B2Gold ( $BTG and $BTO.TO) is the most solid gold miners I know, check them out for yourself. Record earnings coming out next week too, so excellent time to safely setup your safety net that can grow in the short and long term. Nice dividend too."
"This is not financial advice. I think the coming days are going to be positive for the stock. I expect that we are about to start the true short squeeze soon. Tonight we may see efforts to pull this stock down, but it's also equally likley that this price could shoot up. I believe that next monday, from pre-market this stock will rise massively again. In my oponion, HOLD THE LINE"

"I get that some people are trying to make a political statement, but I get concerned for individual investors who are buying stocks that are probably grossly overvalued, and intend to hold these forever. My advice, as a seasoned investor, is be careful. If you want to donate money to a political cause, then that's your choice. However, you will most likely get burned trying to play this game."

The elites are scrambling. Buy anywhere you can and hold.
"COPY AND PASTE/REPOST:PLEASE LIKE THIS TO GET IT TO TRENDINGTHE AMC GAME PLANI know this will sound ridiculous/ too good to be true but here is the plan:First things first we NEED AMC to close above $9 tomorrow otherwise there will be no short squeezeIf we close above $9, it's a one way ticket to tendy townClosing above $9 means all shorts have to cover their positions Friday AH/ Monday, which means they have to buy at the current ask priceWSBs plan is to have limit orders for $1,000 so the shorts covering have no choice but to buy back their shares at $1,000 each, so this will be our plan aswell. Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone here did.This means that AMCs stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000Bad news: The shorts are massive institutions which much more buying power than all of the retail investorsGood news: Because AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of tomorrow no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.This is not easy but 100% possible to do$AMC $GME $BB #NOK"

Wish i had money to bankrupt robinhood. Everyone leave that trading company asap... our rights are being controlled our money our future.. you bet im #$%$!
It ain't over brothers!! The game has just begun.
they will lose..just bought in.
Big comeback ahead. Hold strong. We make the price. We have the stronger position. They just can mess around with the stock shortterm.
What the F is GME thinking? They need to dilute asap and raise capital to save the company and have the flexibility to reinvent themselves. Congrats to autistic wbs u proved how connected the markets can be to real life. Its how THEY rig and control things. These same entities not only short companies but unduly support failing companies or push agendas such as green agenda via wall st and social engineering. You all finally know what i knew. Lose money from these creeps and u see their game is evil. Ultimate revenge is helping these companies u like to raise capital to truly fight in real world as well not just the fake stock price

I just Checked and Robinhood is limiting your buying position of shares; I wonder is ameritrade is doing the same. I’m trying to get in at the Dips; so I can hold until it reaches $1000!
when is this ending?
can't wait for that sonic boom next week. proud of those diamond hands!!!
Sending 94 new shares to the moon.
I have ignored the robinhooders up until this point.This action of greatness makes me want to join your merry band of investors.
"EVERYONE - play the game but don't just follow blindly. For price action to move parabolically like GME, the stock actually needs to be heavily shorted. I'm not even sure if there's another stock out there with short interest that exceeds 100% (which is what's driving the swings).I see $BB, $BBBY, $AMC, $NOK, $TLRY and others through out there. But none have the same level of short interest. $BBBY and $AMC are highest, but $BB is low."
If you see that short squeeze is happening in AMC I GME just ride on and stop promoting other stocks. Focus on these two because we lost power if we spread between 10 stocks.
Pre market Monday is gonna be amazing to see. Tendies to the moon!’
"GameStop board should approve a share issue at these prices, maybe approve a 1M-10M share issue over the weekend. They could net $100M-500M which would allow them to transition their business away from brick and mortar to some sort of Amazon like game service. This would be a huge win for their employees and real long term investors. Make hay while the sun is shining."

"Message on my TD Waterhouse account:28 Jan. 2021Important Information for Margin Account HoldersEffective immediately, we have increased margin requirements to 100% and restricted short selling and uncovered options trading for GameStop (NYSE: GME), Express Inc. (NYSE: EXPR), and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC).HOLD your shares. Do not sell."
"This is nothing political, I just want money, GME is a good value stock that had a very low price and should be valued much higher, and probably do some stocksplits. We like this stock, we think we can make money of this stock, and we've made shitloads of money of this stock. I don't care if there is a hedge fund that is on the wrong side of a trade. It just improves the proposition that we can get to $5000 per share soon. We already 10x'd this week. We can do it next week as well."
"They made a mistake trying to ban this stock, now more people will want it. 200%+ on Monday."
How long will this last realistically?
After hours is gonna rocket. They have nothing left to hold this back....
You all realize that if the short squeeze happens the billions that Melvin and others have to cover will be controlled 100% by the asking price over the course of multiple market days? If enough people set limit orders ‘outlandishly’ high ... they would in theory fill for this reason (similar to strength/weakness in resistance levels on a regular stocks chart). That’s why my strategy is setting a limit order of $5000 ... and waking up at 4am every morning this week.... watching the market till 8pm like a hawk ... if I have to adjust the order or cancel and sell at market I will. But that isn’t a terrible/unreasonable factor to bear in mind. It’s actually how investors have approached regular squeezes much like this one. VK in 08 was at the time the biggest squeeze and temporarily held the highest MKT cap on the market. If GME hits just a third (33%) of today’s current highest MKT cap today (AAPL I believe) it would be valued at 10000/share. VK was also shorted much less % wise than GME is even right this second. Hold and don’t settle. Of course be wary of volume and momentum; obviously this isn’t advice just something to consider on our way up. (:
Wouldn’t be surprised if this hits $700 today
"if you're bearish or talking about other stock get out of the convo, this chat for real holders"
Looks like consolidation. Im fine hanging here a couple if days
They just halted trading. Went from $410 to $354 in 60 seconds.
Keep buying
Just a question - Can Gamestop execs under pressure from the short hedge funds issue more shares to buy at a lower price and collapse the bull run on the stock.
It’s going to $600 at Friday
"Well, you saw what happened at AMC. They issued new shares .. this was done to solve this naked shorting problem. The same thing will happen here. Stability of the larger stock and bond markets are critical for national security. They won't allow those to tank due to indiscriminate selling by hedge funds that want to cover their shorts in GME/AMC/BBBY, etc."
I am so angry at robinhoodapp!!

"They manipulate the market, don’t fall for it! Just hold!"
Great time for Reddit to go public IPO
Shorts right now.
Tomorrow is gonna be a exciting day with GME and the shorties trying there best to drag it down so they can cover.
United we stand divided we fall....
"typical gme long in the basement, buying more shares"
So beautiful 
Lol social media saying up to 10 hedge funds are crippled and scrambling behind the scenes.History in the making! Hold the line until they pay us whatever we ask.
"Some folks on WSB say that Robinhood will allow $GME buys but only 5 shares (max) at a time (and I don't know if there will be a daily limit.) If hedge funds aren't limited to 5 share transactions too, then Robinhood is still making retail traders fight Wall Street with one hand tied behind their backs."
hows that legal 
"Show of a lifetime, when will you get a chance to watch WS doo doo their pants real time. Just 1 share a seat. Show will last a while."
Whatever you do don’t sell......The squeeze will happen next week
LAST CHANCE. I am buying 10 more on vanguard
squeeze the hedgefundsout LOL
After the hedge funds have been taught a lesson - who will be first to sell and bank profits. Until the money is in your account...it's not real profit.
We are the ones we were waiting for.
"They are limiting how much GME shares you can buy, think about why. They're scared to get squeezed. SPREAD THE WORD! EVERYONE ALL OVER THE WORLD BUY GME SHARES AND HOLD AND WE WILL TAKE DOWN WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!"
Today I witnessed fraud
I smell a multi l-billion dollar class-action lawsuit against robinhood app in our future
Im confused how did this go up when you could only buy 1 share on robinhood? Did everybody switch out of robinhood?
SSR in effect means no shares can be used to short so shorters can only buy to close an account . Hold your shares and make them pay
I don't care they have to pay my price
I love how Kevin O'Leary defended this!

Robinhood is back pedalling hard. They said they will allow “some” GME buying tomorrow. See what happens when you affect their bottom line...they saw the mass exodus and are trying to stop the bleeding of their platform. Fakk them hard!
Citron said a big message at 9am. What do you think it is?
this is going back in to the 350-400 by pre-market
"Whatever happens, we are part of history. Proud of you guys"
"GME is a stock has global influences now. Robinhood has banned to buy, but the European market, the Asia market are buying after market closed yesterday to push this stock price go up and up!"
"Great, so now you're going to take out Robinhood, the company that brought you commission-free trading. For #$%$ks sake. Let's go back to the days of paying $15 commissions on trades, eh?"
"I don't think people understand, the big boys in at WSB are the same as the whales in the crypto community. No matter how much they speak of revolution or 'taking on the system', they will always be the first ones to cash out. Pump and Dumps are cool, but most will get dumped trying to get in on the pump.You guys think WSB is immune to greed??Greed is universal, and once momentum runs out, the main players who pumped this stock will be out before anyone realizes, and when they realize, it will be too late. This may have started off as retail investors vs hedge funds, but it will end with retail vs retail, and the pain will be on both sides.Thanks for listening :)"
"This is coming to its natural death. Volume is going down daily. On Monday, there will be no interest left in this. Whoever is holding over the weekend will see it open at $100 and dropping from there. If you can, see it after hours and save yourself. If you dont believe, check the history and look at the volume yourself."
I closed a holy grail short #$%$ in CHK last QTR... went from over 60 to 0.00.... took a few years.. but I will make multiple times that gain on GME next few short weeks as I short it to under $5..... wow!
History will remember our bravery more than those with no shame :D. 2000+ by mid of next week. Just hold!
Just look at the volkswagen squeeze chart. See that big dip before the squeeze?
I have 3906 shares and I am holding to teaching 1000. I bought my shares at 280
Remember a guy committed suicide on robinhood because he lost his savings. Now your asking people to dump money into a stock with no coordinated profit taking. This means that it will be a domino effect of emotion when profit taking happens. People are going to be hurt and loose allot of money while some get rich. The sounds like the people that you are trying to fight.
I will sleep soundly tonight and this weekend. How abut you longs?
"Make no mistake: the price will plunge, possibly as low as $60, at 3:59:59. Then, mysteriously, at 4:00:01, shoot up to $500/share. They need those call options OTM. That's why buying is restricted. They will naked short sell to avoid buying the stock and paying the options."
"Maybe the CEO needs to change the name to just Robin' because he's stealing our rights. If he's going to keep this up, more and more people are going to close their account and change to another Brokerage. I'm sure people will get by with Webull since it doesn't seem to let anyone down.$gme $ctrm $nakd $amc $bbby $nok $sndl"

Put a good for day limit sell at $1000+ on your shares so they can’t be re-shorted. If the sale is triggered you still win.
"If after hours are red, then pre market will be red too. Been like that all week"
"$TLRY stock won’t go up just by watching it, posting bullish messages, and hoping for regulations which won’t happen for 1 or 2 years (before midterm elections). Keep buying the stock like $GME otherwise price will keep on falling. The market won’t move unless you buy shares. Seems like everyone made their bet and just keep hoping and posting messages on forums which is handing it over to shorters."
Isn’t it easy to decide tomorrow’s strategy for all of someone post how many shared short have to cover tomorrow?
Currently at +44% AH
My fellow Hoodies: Spread the 5 share rule to your friends. At this price (which is beautiful and getting beautifuller) my job only allows me to get 1 share anyway.

lawsuit coming to Robinhood. they will be on the hook. they intentionally stopped trading leading to predictable losses.
"Back in January2020, before the pandemic and when our economy was open and thriving, gme was going for $4.00 a share. Many stores have been closed for months this year, so why should they be worth more than $4.00 now? They shouldn't be.When this mania ends, I doubt it will be worth $20."
"Look at volume and the order book. They’re playing the short ladder trick to trick algos that there’s a selloff, hence making the price down. In reality the shares are only going from hedge fund A to hedge fund B back and forth. They will try to do that continuously until they can’t tomorrow."
Halted
Y’all getting played and pimped. Not by Wall Street. By each other. If you don’t sell you must enjoy stress and no sleep
What limit to set for sale? $ 1000?
"Why I'm joining the cause and buying $GME stock today!I am a retail investor in $NVAX and in my opinion I have had to endure the seemingly constant peddling of fear, uncertainty and doubt as part of manipulation by short sellers, paid bashers and various media outlets over the past year. In my opinion this has been to the detriment of additional equity funding for development of what has been confirmed today as a life saving vaccine, with the highest efficacy rate so far for the original COVID19 strain.Having lost my father during the pandemic, I wonder how many more lives could have been saved in the future had this nefarious manipulation not suppressed Novavax's share price so that greedy people can line their pockets with other people's money.I am buying $GME stock and more $NVAX stock today to send a message to short sellers and their cronies everywhere that the table has turned. Squeeze the shorts!"
If trading allow buy with both hand. buy calls as many as you can. They must learn lesson not to censor us when their plan back fire on them.
"lol I admit I am already down in my position for $AMC and $GME . At first it was about the money. I already lost a lot and the calls expired today without any profit. That's okay, I had a good time with my friends and I never felt closer to my country in a while."
"Hold to the end. It’s not just about the money, it’s about the power. If we roll over now, the precedent is set and we have no hope for the future."

Robinhood has to use line of credit to shore up finances....per CNBC!!!!!!
"OK another reason to have diamond hands. Shorts are currently paying brokerages almost $16 million/day in interest just to ""borrow"" GME shares from longs. Nearly $500 million every month. This is because the interest rate to borrow these shares is over 25% and shorts have shorted approximately the same number of shares as outstanding shares-that's $22.7 billion worth of GME stock. Shorts funds are hemorrhaging money staying short. This cannot go on for long."

I have no position -- because i view this as being thrown in a lion's den... But kudos to the longs and I hope this goes to $1000. For once let these hedge funds get what they deserve. But then again -- I also see that the biggest gainers of this play will be the other hedge funds -- who played you all for their own gains. I believe this play happened ONLY because other hedge funds smelled blood and joined in. You reatil guys could never have done it alone...IMHO
I think it's safe to say we got this. HOLD!

The entire world is demanding new semiconductors as that unlocks the holy grail of the future. Deep value squeeze play here not unlike $GME was at $6. $bb $spy $amc"

"In March, when GME reports a quarterly profit, people will know why we bought. Shorts will burn."

HEDGE FUNDS ARE BURNING BILLIONS IN SHORT INTERESTS.DIAMOND HANDS AND WE WIN WHEN THEY RUN OUT OF LIQUIDITY.
Just closed my robinhood account after this Bull of them blocking trades. Doing the same with ameritrade eventually once this hold period on #amc #gme #cydy #koss etc is over. What’s everyone else using? Robinhood and Ameritrade need to go. #marketmanipulation
Update 8: Decided to do a quick update. I was about to leave and was getting ready.Looks like the Feds/Suits decided to continuously halt $GME so they can force liquidate to create a scare tactic to get people to sell out. It's all algos and they are going to keep pushing it down until the shorts can get out. I'm willing to bet they will push it all the way down to $20 today while they halt it on and off so the hedgies don't blow up a major institution.
OUCH 43%
just bought some gme to stir the pot lets gooooo
COME TO AMC
Noob question. Could GME use their market cap increase to purchase another company. Something like ZNGA? To sort of transform the business
Your right yahoo is not even showing the 492 dollar spike today at 2:10 go on Google you will see . The charts arnt the same hmm
Guess it didn't hit $1000 after all today... still if you'd asked me last friday where it would be I'd have said $30 so it's kind of amazing to see it at 328. Congrats to those that have held let's see where it is next week.
"what time do optoions expire, end of dat?"

"Street Insider:Hedge fund titan Steven Cohen of Point72 engaged with Dave Portnoy on Twitter, asking why Portnoy has a problem with him. ""I'm just trying to make a living,"" Cohen said.Portnoy said prison time is needed for Cohen, Citadel, and the operators of the Robinhood app, after Robinhood shut down trading in some high-flying stocks like GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC (NYSE: AMC). Portnoy said he lost money because of the decision by Robinhood, which he views as rigged.Cohen added that ""trading is a tough game.""(Personal comment: It's not a game if you cheat. It's a scam.)"
"It’s time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share. This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market. Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit. Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown? Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday. By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008? Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?"
The volume is increasing... is that because the UK and Asia opened?
Never buy robinhood IPO. Spread the word. The hedge funds can own it. $GME $AMC $BB $NOK $TSLA $NIO $IPOE $SPCE
After we buy all the stock we should take GME private!
Ok so what is holding this stock up now? Is it earnings? How do I make money off of my gme holdings?
"Buy under 200, sell above 2000. Simple. This is a free ten bagger."
They are trying to tank it before close. Buy and hold!
MERVIN CAPITAL HAS STOPPED BORROWING STOCKS: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GMETHE RECKONING IS UPON US!
Probably go to $500 next week and shorts are forced to cover. New shorts coming in and stock starts going back down. I might be wrong. But gme could transform the company and thrive. $30 billion market cap actually is not that expensive if they can go completely online.
Wow we have the power!!!
What would happen to the share price if company announced chapter 11 or 13?
Be careful lots of paid posters on here to scare you off Hold just hold

Is it late to buy GME?
"I bought yesterday as th pps dropped into the low $200s and I will hold on today, So we can all do our part in pushing gme through $500"
Buy on RH with limit orders they are going thru
Shorts will be covering for the next 5 trading days. That being said the price will keep increasing as they have to pay. At the moment they’re bleeding and paying a ton in interest. Hold strong  and the stock could easily be over $1k Monday - Wednesday. Trend looks identical to vw before it hit 1k
1k by tmrw
1500-2000 Til Monday morning. Shorties must cover today!
Do shorters have to close at closing or after-hours?
"So Robinhood will again allow 'limited' buying of $AMC, $KOSS, $GME, etc... What about the repeated halting of trading? Each time this happened the SP dropped after restarting. Will this continue tomorrow?"
Don’t panic sell tomorrow. They have to cover 226 percent of the stock. This will go into next week.
$SNDL the next GME. Go for it!!
HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ameritrade CEO came on today explaining why they suspended trading in GME and other selected stocks. He sidestep the question and said well we couldn't get any short shares and anyway nobody can get those shares. Later on on CNBC a big fund manager comes on bragging about how he shorted a bunch of GME shares. Apparently some folks get special privileges that we don't. Not a level playing field here. I call scam!
Europe hold line for us!!!! We are coming right after you!!!!
GME is not money! It is a video game store at your local mall that has not seen an actual customer in months!!!
BUY AND HOLD
Anybody worried this squeeze is gonna F the broader market?
Today I total bought 600 shares from Robinhood
Some X-Files level stuff going down right now.
"It took me more than a quarter century, but I finally realized, I had the story of Robin Hood all wrong. He's not the guy who takes from the rich and gives to the poor. He does the opposite. He takes takes from the poor and gives to the rich."

"Non-Boomers, please help me out:Not sure what the actual short interest is. As of Jan. 15, it was allegedly 61.8 m shares (says Yahoo). I am not sure what the short interest is today, as NYSE only publishes that twice a month.Assuming the 61.8 m comes even close, then the market value of the shorts (price*no of shares) is, assuming a price of $ 250, about $15.5 billion. Short margin with most brokers for retail investors is way about 100% (often 300%). Less with prime brokers, I gather, but probably today not that much. Let's assume it is 200%. That means the shorts must put up $31 billion of collateral only on the GME shorts. Not very likely. Applying the same calculation to $30 (about the price on Jan. 15), the market value of the shorts was $1.8bn, and margin requirements were around 30-50%, probably a lot less with prime brokers. So make that $900 million collateral.Can we assume that shorts (who have constantly lost money) have actually put up an additional $30bn of collateral to secure their margin? If not, the actual short ratio may be much less, and that means the rallye was not so much driven by shorts covering, but rather by Robinhooders buying shares and OTM calls that become ATM or even ITM calls and forced the sellers to adjust their hedges.And if that is true, we have a simple, but very impressive retail bubble based on the perception of a short squeeze, not an actual short squeeze."
Stayed up all night to watch this epic battle today! Hope it will be a good show. I really hope you get up to 5000. But be safe and sell quickly.
Considering the pressure from the Congress i assume by tomorrow the restrictions on $GME $AMC etc Will be gone and they Will soar back to moon

Guys please calm down let me buy some shares at cheap price
"don't be scared by their dip tactics, hold and buy!! keep it above 320!"
I like the action this squeeze is putting on the long stocks. Makes for a nice buying opportunity when the HF have to sell FAANG to cover.

"Whatever you guys do in the next few days, remember that GME is a company with diminishing sales based out of shopping malls. Most analysts value the stock at less than $20.00 a share. You may be able to deftly trade this current short squeeze and make a profit, but if you are left holding the bag when the music stops, you will lose a great deal of money."
KEEP 300!!!
"I’m just telling you guys. With the current volume. The price will never goes up above $600! Everyday you will see further decay as the buying power decay. It’s not about buying and holding that will jack up the price. It’s rather the speed and volume at which buyer out pace seller that makes the price goes up. Looking from the volume, the greatest momentum buyer has to increase the price is at the opening bell. Around 7-9 millions shares are traded in the first 30-40 minutes. However from what I seen, the seller volume and speed has been able to keep the price pretty stable at opening. Then buying volume and speed slow down and the seller slow down to get rid of their borrow shares. Then the price trend downward because the seller volume and speed is greater with occasional bump at lower price. This continue to happen until 45-50% of the opening bell price has been achieved. Then you will see the price begin to go up again as seller began to buy shares for cheap. Tomorrow they do the same thing."
The major hedge funds that shorted this stock have closed their position. Right now you guys are not fighting against them. You are speculating against each other. Just make sure that you’re investing/speculating the money you are willing to lose. Don’t put all our retirement money into this. Just a friendly warning. Peace!
Hold hold hold!!!

One you'll be watching a movie about all this. And you'll be so proud of what you did!!!
Why would anyone buy into this stock at these prices? I get it if you bought at $10 or under that you are holding. But why would anyone buy this stock for more than $300. You are just making the original buyers and big institutions (check out who holds most of the floats) rich. They could decide to dump the stock any time they want and leave you bagholding
Fake closing price yesterday. Today we will see the real demand.
Pre market in half an hour. 500-600 USD incoming!!!

Tomorrow we FEASTHOLD LONG AND STRONG
"Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, and certain trading platforms has done three thing as following:1- Banning retail investors from purchasing certain stocks ($NAKD, $NOK, $AMC, $GME.. etc).2- ""Forced liquidations"" of certain stocks.3- Raising margin requirements for certain securities.I think it's illegal to ban investors from stocks that used to be allowed to trade, and they'll face a serious legal challenges also I think this is the main point that made Levi & Korsinsky LLP start to act, but (Forced liquidations, and raised margin requirements) is allowed in certain cases.Hopefully they'll will get what they deserve."

They using now market maker and broker to create unfair rule as bail out. They can prevent buying but don't sell stock. They really have game that back fire on their face. I may be wrong on my earlier assessment.

"How social media with mass participation affected and is affecting politics, so will be the mass participation of small-scale investors for the stock market as seen in the case of GME. A big thank you from the market suppressed small investors. The crooks of wall street, who have been amassing billions of dollars of wealth, now must think twice. GME has changed the market rules and rulers.The shorts destroyed Inovio (INO) SP from being the first to manufacture the most effective and safe DNA Covid vaccine through their crooked actions in cahoots with the bog pharma and possibly FDA interfered with every phase of vaccine testing by spreading fake news. This small next generation DNA based medicine company with a very rich portfolio of DNA medicine could only watch the peril of shorts. SEC has not done anything to date for stopping blatant market aberrations created by shorts through fake news and speculations. Tesla survived only after its long-term market struggles.All GME owners and small-scale traders, let you be in charge and lead the way going forward!! Let us not be victims anymore and let us not allow the billionaire crooks of the hedge funds to go unfettered in their daily manipulations. Let there be real power and benefits to real investors!! Let all your investments turn out good! GLTA today."
Power to the people!!
HOLD! Put your sell price to 600 if you want a reversal. BE STRONG.
A lot of people had to switch brokers and their new accounts are still getting settled. Brokers like fidelity only let you trade 10k instantly. Everything above that needs to settle first. This really is the quiet before the storm. Once everyone is back in action they're gonna come in like a hurricane.

"The S&P 500 Index is an index of, roughly speaking, the 500 biggest U.S. public companies by market capitalization. GameStop is not in that index, because a month ago it was a small company, in the index of 2,000 small companies. Now it is—measured by market capitalization, though nothing else—a big company. If the redditors can hold on long enough, can they get GameStop added to the S&P? Can they turn it into a big company just by bidding the stock up? If they can, then S&P 500 index funds will be forced to buy it, no matter the price, and all the redditors who brought it here can get out at a profit. And they will have a big and permanent win, and also the current version of financial capitalism—the index-fund version—will collapse in absurdity."
"please upvote this. No one sell, this is a war between the hedge funds shorting this stock and the investors putting their hard earned money into it. We're trying to win for once and they're shutting us down. Road to 1000."

"Weldone Guys, Unfortunately I missed the chance and stuck in position of stong fundamentals but still no growth. Dont worry this GME pricing is result of a chain reaction started by you all robinhood warriors. Same happened with Tesla. Several billion dollars of short positions got closed today on curent prices. If chain reaction continue then prices will more go up. And if not then still it will take some time to break current rices. I am happy for you all and pray for you all. You finally did I dreamed. Stock market is simple buying and selling market and has very much less to do with fundamentals except setting best go price.These brookers, hedge funds and banks stealing money from public since decades, they dont even use their own money for trading. They use public money deposited in 401K accounts, retirement funds and other schemes. Hard working Americans give them money so they have something when they retire. These crooks makes atleast 1000 times against 1 dollar they get and give only 2 dollars back on retirement to those people.Further Chapter11 bankruptcy is also helping managements, banks and brookers. Bonds are secure because thats bank money; Bank lend money to these corporates after doing all audits, checking every detail of company. But common share holders will be first in line to loose equity who hardly knows anything beside some figures in disclosure; and on bankruptcy day that shareholder find out that those values are of no meaning anymore.Covid19 made banks tremendously rich and right now they are also indirect owners of great companies via chapter11. Courts are not willing or they might dont have time to investigate corporates comming for volutary chapter 11. Every single penny which public is getting in Unemployment and stimulus is actually their own. I am proud of you guys. Love you all."

GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) short seller Melvin Capital Management LP said Monday it had received $2.75 billion in investment from hedge funds Citadel and Point72.
$GME This is a glorious moment we are seeing. The birth of a cult stock and a huge turnaround story. Video games are a huge growing market. Retail locations will be in demand. Good way to advertise. Covid won't be here forever. Easy for company to shift to digital and leverage brick and mortar locations for extra visibility.

"Funny, I don't recall brokerages halting the buying of TSLA when it rocketed over 700% the past year (equating to over $500 BILLION) for no good reason (stock split and S&P inclusion), but now they are worried about a few billion in some small caps. A crash in Tesla's stock would hurt millions of investors, but they aren't worried about that. I guess some stocks are perfectly safe investments at any price."
Should I buy at open or wait for a dip?
The sell volume in the last hour has been the lowest since Tuesday. There is no buy walls setup which is allowing firms to sell small amounts to drive the price down. They are trying to hedge their shorts to buy cheaper stocks. Hold the line.
Trying to understand what is happening from reading posts and can't find articles on what started all of this and why everyone is in on AMC and GMS (articles just seem to be attacking it)...where do I get information on the movement? Who decided on these stocks? I want to learn and support it but I'm new to investing.
Well volume is too low for shorts to have covered in the dip. Maybe some retail shorties but not yet the hesgies. Bigger rise yet to come. HOLD
"I looked at the chart and compared with $GME. Not sure it's a consequence cause 2 chart in last 5 days almost same. So $GME UP 80％ ah, it could be another run for us too"

so the laws and governments protect the hedge fund managers but when people do the same its a problem?
CANT WAIT FOR MONDAY

You do realise that now you are messing up the markets for other retail investors. You’ve made your point and won the war. Please can it stop now. You’re going to crash the whole market.

Tomorrow will be so interesting to watch.

Feels like $GME will come back stronger. I’ve weathered the Shorts Storm!
Robin hood will re-open limited buy for GME tomorrow. Dont know what limited means but at least we can buy in the dip real fast before it goes BOOOOOOMMMM
But what if Wall Street shorts the peak ?

"yeah, this sounded legal and like a free market economy...Robinhood issued a statement on its blog emphasizing its goal of ""democratiz[ing] finance for all"" but cautioned that ""recent volatility"" prompted the broker to introduce certain restrictions.""We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary, the company wrote. ""In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."

"Good job, get your space boots ready!!"
"Lots of attention steering towards bigger names stocks like $GME $AMC $BB $AAL not only because of the squeeze, but also they can easily be traded on Robinhood. If $AITX was able to be traded on RH, maybe we would see a huge run up. For now, I think we will see a few more dips in the road until an uplist to OTC.QB. Buy whenever you see a chance and hold as long as you can. GLTA"

"So, this is Interactive Broker. So i had 42k USD initially. 1008 AMC shares were bought around $20 and i bought 50 GME CFDs at 370 because they have barred me from buying stocks today. I have a fee other shares amounting to $2k Usd.All in All my equities are around 42k (means nothing borrowed on margin!!!) but i got forcefully liquidated for 16 CFDs of GME around 170 when it reached the bottom low. Can someone explain???"

Any chances it goes over 400 again today?
"Don't trust Robinhood, use Fidelity instead."
"Main reason they remove retail trader from equation because it was exposing their over leaveraged funds that can't handle few billions losses. Ripple effect that might bring down entire market.If this is how they want to play to hide reality we need to stop part of that rigged system.We exit first and left them bag holder.I am planning to liquidate entire stock market and then trade in S&P 500 Put and call game only mainly on short side while accounting it's against your odd all time. Knowing it's against odd, i can plan that include likely going up daily and still make money while mostly short side. My account is pamenant demanged in this but I learn painful important lesson that this system is even more volatile than I thought. I thought this thing will die itself and we return back to normal."
I see lot of people here who bought the stock without knowing how Short and call works
Get in now before its too late. GME to $5000+. Continue to hold and the squeeze will start soon!

"Guys they just shorting it to scare you out of your position. Hold they have to buy a lot of shares today. At the price we want! If you see a low price, its probably a short attack not a sell off. But shorts have to buy those shares back so we bounce back to new highs!HOLD!"

"We can't buy more, but those holding will be able to sell at 3x 4x today price to shorts covering"
It’s fantastic what you are all doing. I’ve never really looked into shorting from their side but have had shares wrecked by them (fubo tv was a big one). What has stopped them just covering their loss when it started going against them say when it rose 10%? Or did they have to carry on holding the short position?what is the significance of today’s date (that I keep reading about)? Do they have to buy back by end of play today? If so is that when you sell to lock in your profits or do you keep holding until the people shorting are all out of the position?
GME back up to 260 after dropping down to 123. That tells me this isn’t over. I’m on the sidelines but this is clearly far from over
Shorting is not fair for one big reason: Because these guys can short a stock and then release negative information to drive it down. We all know that fear is the easiest to “sell.” They create their own advantage.
Everyone who bought over $300 will be remembered as hero’s fighting a rigged system
AH drops are nothing. No need to panic fellas! WE HOLDD!

"ALL GLORY IS FLEETING“For over a thousand years Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeteers, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning: That all Glory is Fleeting.”"

Robinhood is committing crime by selling shares in cash accounts w/o owner’s consent.
"Thu, January 28, 2021, 10:34 PMOnline trading app Robinhood said late Thursday that starting tomorrow it will allow ""limited buys"" of securities such as GameStop Corp. , AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. , and others stocks that have surged in price in recent weeks.Sue them they are in panic, they must allowed normal buying tomorrow...squeeze them to open normal trading"
"You think institutional investors buy and sell like us? They use computer software. They been using the same tactic. Jack up the price during 4-7am where only institutional investors can trade. When the market up at 9:30am. They are lock and loaded to sell because they know your buy and hold strategy. They will sell high until you are out of gas, pushing the price down and start buying for the next day. It’s all done by trading software. Been doing this everyday! The institutional volume is greater than the buyer volume that’s how they are able to manipulate the trade. Make sure they have at least 20 million shares ready to sell at the beginning of the day. The computer is able to hold the position at the opening bell around 7-10 million share. Then the volume slow down, the software begin to trade slowly until they get rid of the other 5 million shares. When they have about 5 million shares left, increase the speed of selling to push down the price to half its value. Then they buy back slowly. If the price goes up to fast, they use their share reserve to sell to keep the price where they want to buy. When they finish buying back their 20 millions share. They get out and let the price goes back up. Tomorrow they do it again. They don’t have to guess because they know your buy and hold strategy!"
Robin Hood is Robbinghood
"Do not let the algorithms, MM, and hedge funds get you to panic sell. This is what they want and they can make back all their money. The small time investor has the power to hold and stay long.

HOLDING STRONG!!
Robinhood will only let you buy 1 share now!!!!!!!!
For those that cannot see it. The volume is so so low on level 2 right now it's unbelievable.The funds are shorting to each other and starting to finally realize there is risk they will be the bag holders.
This REALLY has nothing to do with a cause. These Hedge Funds are using the people on these message boards to take money from other Hedge Funds. You’re being used to commit fraud and it isn’t funny

"Yeah baby! The elite globalist ""coastal rich"" democRat voting hedge fund investors are sweating thru yet another money losing TRAPPED day in the market lol. There is NOTHING ""legal"" these globalist elite enemies can do at this point either, they are trapped to the tune of hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars on GME alone. Wait until this ""really catches on"" soon amongst the 99%! Either wall street completely changes and loses 90% of investors as a result, OR they face TRILLIONS in losses (wealth redistribution to the masses lol).Wow, never thought I'd see anything like this in my lifetime. I believe this is far far bigger than what people realize it is, because this IS showing the world ""how to beat the rich at the same game they've beaten the 99% at for decades"", and you can bet millions more small investors will jump into this ""war"" to ""give it to the rich elite"". This is ugly for the rich lol, they truly ARE in trouble here. Their best bet at this point may be to ""buy GME the company completely outright"" and cap their 100's of billions of dollars in losses. LOL!"
"Thanks guys! Citron has stole a bunch of my money and I love getting it back 100 fold! Long GME and OCGN Citron has big short position in OCGN. I hope we can do the same job there, I would love to break Citrons bank and send then into bankruptcy."
Not a WSB guy but absolutely sickened by the shutout of retail investors on these stocks. GME couldn't be further from what I usually invested but just bought in at 240 out of principle.
IM DOWN $700K and STILL HOLDING!!! (Thumbs up to motivate these paper hands into holding) also this video helped me a lot when I was considering selling thought I would share https://youtu.be/cYTDNoWPyOI

Panic buying! Shorts eating shorts! $600 coming by 10AMFact!
"It is now clear that SEC is in bed with billionaire hedge funds Citadel's Ken Griffin and Point72's Steve Cohen. It seems SEC directed Robinhood and other online trading brokerage to stop selling $GME, $NOK, $BB, $AMC and other trending stocks to retail investors to allow these hedge funds to manipulate the price and cover at a huge discount. If it is not criminal I don't know what is."
Give the big corporations a black eye!
$384 next recovery ceiling. DO. NOT. SELL
Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management.Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to the people taking the free market back.Citadel owns the app Robinhood.Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH.Market manipulation.Copied.....

"Big Tech says you can only say what we allow you to say, and now Wall Street says you can only buy the stocks that we allow you to buy."
SHORTS need 2-3 trading more days to cover......................
retail investors cannot buy so put pressure on price. Then Hedge Funds step in and buy share at lower price. these trading platforms are arbitrarily changing the rules to benefit the big guys.

EVERYONE PLEASE HOLD. If you sell you not only cost yourself potential profits but shorts may snipe your shares. This will cost you and fellow holders! PLEASE HOLD.

"think about this. hedge funds shorted this from 30 down to what, 15. The stock is over 300....how many hedge funds might this wipe out when they try to cover millions at 300 bucks per short?"
Why is anyone on Robinhood Platform. They have shown themselves to be working with the shorts. If you are on that platform get a new broker.
I like this stock

"The great journalist Matt Taibbi comes to our side: ""This is where society will ultimately come down, of course, uniting to denounce $GME as financial Trumpism, even though it actually comes closer to being an updated and superior version of Occupy Wall Street. It’s likely not any evil manipulation scheme, but ordinary people acting — out of self-interest, but also out of sheer enthusiasm for one of the best reasons to do just about anything, because you can — on a few simple, powerful observations.They’ve seen first that our markets are basically fake, set up to artificially accelerate the wealth divide, and not in their favor. Secondly they see that the stock market, like the ballot box, remains one of the only places where sheer numbers still matter more than capital or connections. And they’re piling on, and it’s delicious, not so much because they’re right, but because the people running for cover are so wrong, and still can’t admit it.""https://taibbi.substack.com/p/suck-it-wall-street"

"In order to short any stock, you have to borrow it. The large hedge funds borrow it in aggregate from all of you long holders. If you do not want your stock lent out for “affirmative determination”, or “hypothecated”, then call your brokerage firm and have it moved to your “type 1” or fully paid “cash account”. You may be able to do it online. This has historically been used to cause short squeezes in the past. Usually for larger positions. But if you all do it, they won’t be able to borrow your stock and short it, which I assume is not what you want. Ask question if you like. I traded institutionally for over a decade. I missed GME, but love seeing the action."
Short sellers are the target for now . Thank you for hopefully changing their trading behavior by congress restricting and regulating their business practices.
Hold! Theyre shaking the tree before power hour!

How about Hedge funds only allowed to cover their shorts and NOT short more GME!Fact!
"So let me get this straight. The firms were allowed to buy and sell, but the retail investors were restricted? Is this not illegal?"
"is there any reason why shorting is even allowed to happen? from what i gather, webstreetbets plus all people who support their cause are not happy with all the shorting especially by the hedge funds because of unfair advantage. first, the hedge funds short a stock, then they put out negative company analysis and the stock drops, then they buy to cover and they keep the difference and they make millions of dollars doing this for stocks they set their eyes on. how is this even allowed? on the flip side, the receiving end of that negative company analysis are forced to sell their shares which drives the price down which short sellers scoop. clearly unfair advantage to the hedge fund and a disadvantage to the regular investor.in my opinion, shorting should be be removed from all stock trading platforms. no borrowing of stocks. only sell shares that you have actually purchased. it does not even make sense why someone can borrow shares i purchased without my consent. I own those shares and only I should be able to make the decision on whether i would like to lend those shares (not the trading platform or whoever else). regardless, there should be no lending of shares so there is no shorting. currently there are 4 choices when trading stocks: buy, sell, sell short, buy to cover. how can trading platforms put a stop to shorting? not sure if this can be implemented unilaterally by the trading platform or it has to be a sec approved trading policy for it to be implemented. but to make it happen the following needs to be done. first, remove 'sell short' from the choices but keep ' buy to cover'. eventually existing shorted shares will need to be covered. once all existing shorted shares are covered, then remove the 'buy to cover'. this would leave us with no shorted share. thus going forward, you will only have 2 choices in trading stocks: buy or sell. You can only 'buy' existing shares and 'sell' shares you own. (no more shorting or naked shorting and no borrowing of shares to sell.)"
HOLDING STRONG BABY

"The worry for some regulators/politicos is that their gravy train may get derailed if hedge funds go belly up. Who'll pay for ""conferences"" at exotic locales, their election campaigns, private jets at their disposal, etc. Remember that some like Epstein used to lend his jet for private and official business of precisely such people. These very people are now raising their voice against ""speculative"" buying in GME."

"Its clear, Robinhood has an ""unwholly alliance"" with Fund Mgrs.Hedge Fund Mgrs like Robinhood type trading platforms , so they can rip off the average retail trader. (many Funds give Robinhood a kickback).The GameStop revenge by the retail trader is a thing of beauty.Keep up the good work."
FOR FREEEDOM
"The Reddit crowd seems to have made a classic blunder of not knowing what other people are talking about.There are not more shares short than exist (and if there are then those people who lent non-existent shares are headed to federal prison), because naked shorting was banned.If GME were on the FTD lists then I would say that's actually happening. But in fact it looks like that isn't happening, and the reality is that only MOST shares have been shorted, including nearly all of the shares held by insiders.I don't know where people are getting the short percent of float data but its likely from Morningstar. Probably they are compiling data on a running tally basis of positions opened but not yet marked as closed, even though the counterparty has already surrendered the shares, because they don't settle immediately. so at any one given instant, that number can appear to be impossibly high. But it seems like this entire ""squeeze"" was kicked off based on a misunderstanding about what is actually calculated - the number of 226% is obviously not accurate. The number of 138% is fine, because it refers to the percentage of the float, not the total number of shares in existence. In fact, that number can go up to 148.75% and still not be evidence of naked shorting, because that is how much greater the number of total shares is than the float itself.I think the idea that longs can establish more control over a stock than shorts is crazy. But this is what the WSB crew is insisting is true (based on a misunderstanding of the short interest data). BTW, Longs can't buy more shares than exist either. There's no ""naked long"" positions you can take.That is why naked shorting was banned. Because it was unilaterally and inherently unfair. Not because its inherently fraudulent - it just turns what is supposed to be an equity into a derivative. Which is fine, if that's what is actually being traded.But the stock markets are for equities, not for synthetics - that's the dividing line."

"Is is now clear that SEC is in bed with billionaire hedge funds Citadel's Ken Griffin and Point72's Steve Cohen.

"While Robinhood and other trading apps restricted Millions of investors from buying certain stocks You could just  BUY TRXC & RMO that are under the radar and being naked shorted And the rise of the GME’s of the world cause the big stir because BILLIONAIRE Hedge Fund buddies are crying!!! However, there is no restrictions for hedge funds to short a billion shares to drive down price and cover their short positions today. Hedge funds are allowed to gang up snd short 140% of a company’s stock, but common people are not allowed to buy, while the SEC is sleeping (hopefully not with billionaires!) and allowing all these to happen. Can this disparity look any worse in terms of public relations for the trading apps, the government and elected officials?$AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG."

"I think it's naïve to think that this stock will stay at the inflated price for much longer. What you might also be failing to consider is that other stocks are being driven down, too, so that Mom and Pop's 401K that they rely on for retirement is taking a HUGE hit. The damage isn't just to the hedgies. Think about it!"

"Arhum2 minutes agoRepost from Mr wolf, very important message : “Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying.

Keep fighting the good fight. Cheers. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC and many more”"

"Very easy to tweet and say a few words. Start putting your money where your mouth is Cuomi, Chamath, AOC, Elon. Start putting money into $GME and $AMC. These people by publically putting $1 million dollars which is toilet paper money to them could change the tide. But they won't. Or like Chamath you cashed out for that charity tax break. I mean I am thankful they say something. But it's not enough, they are rich and famous because we allow them to be. Without us, they're nothing."

"HORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATEHedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze. It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON. WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK"
Switch your brokers with no restrictions. Boycott Robinhood
HOLD YOUR POSITION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
did Citron cover its massive losses and call it a day.....and tweet they wont go public with who they ruin next
I just pulled up the short interest report— the entire short interest has only decreased 13.23% from the previous month— yep they are trapped. Now watch this get deleted.
Been in the market for 30 years and never on the short side. I'm not in any of these but watching with amazement. Proud of you guys! It's time the rats get run out of the market. I can only guess how much their manipulation has cost me over the years.

This now GLOBAL !!!!!!! stay strong DO NOT SELL !!!!will push over $1000 ( you will be rich) and they dirty short hedge funds will break just like what they wanted to do to Game Stop and every other company they try to hurt.
"THIS IS IMPORTANT: LOOKS LIKE TODAY THEY ARE WAITING FOR CLOSE TO PUSH THE PRICE DOWN AS FAR AS THEY CAN, JUST LIKE YESTERDAY WHEN IT WENT TO 120. THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE PRICE BELOW 115 TO KEEP CALLS OUT OF THEIR STRIKE PRICE. EXPECT A HUGE DEEP BEFORE CLOSING, BUY IT IF YOU CAN AT THE DIP, HOLD THE SHARES, AND NEXT WEEK WE DINE IN VALLHALA!Not financial advice, i'm holding to my shares thorugh the weekend no matter what."
imagine selling before the hedges need to buy their shorts back. ngmi

watching with great interest. I have 0 shares but wish the bulls success.
Hold! Pre market on Monday will be fun!
alot of RH are opening accounts else where and that can take a cpl days to go through. give it time. if the hedges won this wouldnt be holding above 250
 you ready for this gamma squeeze next week? Shout out to everyone who continues to hold and bleed these wolves
GTE only has 300 Million in the Float....Imagine REDDIT WSB jumping on this again next week to CRUSH THE 32% SHORT shares.....it could jump 700%+ easily like $NAKD $AMC $BBBY $KOSS $GME $RMO $GOEV

Keep holding
This is it...today's battle is almost won and we will be off to the moon tomorrow
Low Volume and We Holding the price.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This is a win they couldn’t even get it back down to under $20 we held strong let’s all buy tmrw morning and get this up to 1000
Remember folks. After hours trading is controlled by the hedge fund billionaires buying and selling to each other to try and scare the average retail investor away. Do not be scared. Tomorrow morning this explodes.
boomers not realizing we are changing the game
so what exactly happens tomorrow do the shorts all have to buy back?
27% shares outstanding held by the insiders? Are they going to save the day and liquidate their holdings at $300 a share or so?
Loading up funds for tasty dips.Thanks shorts!
"Lets hear from the bulls!!! Who’s ready to take this too $1000 tomorrow!! United we stand!!! Im taking an account to $100,000 on Instagram and showing my portfolio while i do it, follow me on Instagram @do_trades "

We are now lower than 6 hours ago))) Common) So, now on Friday you tell us to hold until when? Next Friday? Than till March? How can you advice to buy this stock now with 300 $? Show me proof how you buy it by yourself now!"
Shorts: THIS IS GAMBLING. GAMBLING BAD.Me:

> set to expire in the money (ITM) at market close.Would expect most options sold and not delivered or shares shorted and then shares delivered to close the short.Big Gamma was yesterday. Would expect GME to make a capital raise soon.Who wants to hold GME over the weekend ? to volatile just bank your gains and close the options position.1.) sell to option writer2.) sell short and take delivery3.) or take delivery and sell fast
GME to the moon only if everyone sticks together؟؟؟؟
Don’t listen to all the short boomers and haters. Hold. We are United. We are not moving to CMA or any other stock. Forget it shorts. We are holding the line on this stock. GME only. 
"Went from -$8000 to -$3120 at the current moment (bought 31 shares at $373). Can't wait to see the hedgefunds bleed, they shorted so many of my stocks so I'm taking back profit."
Why are we allowed to have conversations about stocks but not about news?
Nah we're making history tomorrow. Not selling for less than 1000
Who's to say Vlad Putin or one of his henchmen won't show up tomorrow and buy a bunch of calls and stock just to mess with Wall Street. I mean if this does go to $1000 you'll have brokerages and God knows who else sitting on tens of billions of dollars in losses. It'll be at least half as bad as when AIG failed in 2008.
"Every scene has 3 curtains layers.1 everyone sees, 2rd what the scammers see, 3rd what the ones actually making the money see.

If anyone is working with money that belongs to more important things....this lesson is for you."

"It's difficult to see how this all ends well for everyone. My guess is at least few of the big guys will get hammered badly enough to send shockwaves through the entire market. You could see a cascade of failing entities causing a rapid liquidation of big positions in the favorites, the big over priced companies."
"Let me put this straight. Citadel owns Melvin, and Melvin shorted GameStop. And all of you went with suitcases of money to Wallstreet and bought GameStop. Many of you to the brokerage company called RobinHood. And this brokerage company is also owned by Citadel. And there is this Must Asset Management hege fund from South Korea which by the way just in time sold all their shares 3.3 Million @ 300Usd + one day before you guys couldn’t buy any shares anymore on RobinHood. So they walked away with 1 Billion USD in profit. And the CEO a kid of RobinHood tells you guys on TV, everything OK. You can SELL but not BUY. And all the other brokerage companies are restricting the trading in GME and other securities. Really. I know, who could help you guys with some good advice President Putin!. Once he said“ Nicht alles was glänzt ist Gold“."

Any institution (unless it's leveraged ETF/ETN with open info) should have 0 leverage. Let's demand this. they have to de-levarage and take away their ability to manipulate. They have to maintain 200% cash to cover any short losses if they short.

Enjoy being rich and Godspeed!!!!!!!
THIS MOVEMENT IS JUST BEGINNING!!! All my friends and colleagues buying too
I have a feeling Robinhood is going to be another Lehman. I know many people have recently pulled their money from them. Robinhood provides inferior trade prices through the devil (Citadel). I honestly don't what broker is the best. I'm going to do some research on this.
I am in at 290..have no idea what these people do for a living

"The short covering will not take place through trading. Mark this post. There'll be a negotiated (with the company) settlement wherein the company will seek investments .. and these hedges will offer to. The US government will mediate this orderly exit of short position. It is too risky to let the market bid up this stock. Just to cover the positions, massive selling of other securities has to occur which will bring the whole market down for months (if not years) to recover. Governments/funds abroad will be badly hit. The world will blame America for causing yet another economic contagion, while there is already a deep economic recession due to Covid, and US will lose its primacy as an economic power. The risk is simply too great. So, the US government will intervene (if it is not already doing so, behind the scenes) shortly and resolve this."

I am rooting for all of you. really inspiring to see main street hit wall street in the mouth. my question is what happens when the shorties are all done. eventually its just average Joe's holding millions worth of gme. what then? some of you are going to get hurt. some of you will be rich.

"People's fine, if everyone called their broker and demand a goodwill credit of $100, for locking them out of their accounts during active trading hours with no prior notification, or simple incompetence. that would add up pretty quick. Took me an hour and 20 min to get ahold of someone yesterday to get mine. For them to take our money and not even allow us to access it, even for a short time, it deserves a healthy slap on the hands. I like videogames. I like the stock."
Retail still winning. Don’t get caught when the music stops.
New long accounts coming out. Pretending to support “US” and “WE”. Even stating critical analysis. Watch out for these new accounts as they will be the same accounts that will sow fear and push us to Sell when a manipulated drop happens. Will sell L and B shares on Monday as dry powder.

"It is no coincidence that the price closed the day just about $320. If the Yahoo option chain is correct there are 92547 options contracts that finished ITM. Those contracts are going to execute and 9.2M shares are going to end up in people's accounts Monday morning. Those accounts will owe a collective $140M to exercise those contracts. I assume most people that bought $320 calls were planning to sell the shares to cover the cost of exercising the contract. So that is potentially 9.2M shares that need to be dumped on the market Monday morning. And if anyone thinks about that, the price after hours is going to DROP. Imagine this scenario: You bought ten $320 calls. Those calls execute. You owe $320,000 to exercise those shares. By the time you manage to sell your shares on Monday, the short squeeze has broken and they are trading at $40. Your only get $40k from the sale and you now owe $280,000. So if you thought that the risk of buying an option contract was the purchase price of the contract, you are very sadly mistaken. This almost happened to me. I made the mistake of buying 340 2.50 calls for TRVN (they were way OTM and cost next to nothing). TRVN spiked to 2.51 and they were dropped into my account along with a bill for $85,000. Luckily TRVN opened at like 2.60 on Monday and I exited the trade with a few buck and a soiled pair of pants. And yes... some brokers will try to close some of the contracts near the end of the day if you don't have the money to fund the exercise but I believe they all do it differently. I am not an expert. This is not financial advice. And my experience may have been unique. But it did happen to me. And it could happen to a ton of others."
"Wanted to initiate a call spread. D@@@@mn broker wouldn't let the order go through. It's lame. When institutions make money, the status quo is maintained. When retailers make money, the rules are changed. That is the truth."
"I believe I have figured out my only a one share purchase on those 50 stocks. Citadel needs to reduce their short positions on the 50 stocks in question before you buy normal share allotments. For example, 7 million shares short on novavax, cidatel has over shorted these stocks."
Hey guys. As a retail investor trying to beat the system can the multimillionaires share when we should close. Otherwise they are gonna capitalise on us trying to screw the system. I don’t mind being part of the movement if losing my savings is a bigger issue than me not being able to eat when I’m old and senile.
we are holding the line! so its mean we doing good! thanks guys! keep going you and will buy a lambo next week
Everyone is focused on tomorrow’s open put interest but look at 2/19 for the month. Even moreIf tomorrow is 2.2 million shares that need to be accounted for than it is around 5 million on or before 2/19.
Don't fall for the bots posting the SEC is coming after you. Hedge funds are scaring you out of buying.

"Bought 200 shares GME today @128 guys! Thanks for the dip. Easy $$$ on KOSS now since their O/S is only 3,700,000 shares and they are all gone. Check their O/S yourself."
"Turn some firepower to CRNT , $nok, $eric, for great 5G plays once this has run its course."
"FYI what's happening with the $GME plays is NOT the fault of retail traders, it's due to hugely over-leveraged hedge funds that have played this game for years, we need FAR GREATER transparency in how they bet their billions! It's freedom that's at stake right now, we cannot let the suits/big $ crush the hopes & dreams of average people everywhere!"

"For those of you who don't know. Today (Friday) around mid day, the infamous Zack Morris targeted $SNDL for his next swing trade and alerted it on Twitter. He has a fanatical following and it is a very large number of ppl. Every alerr I have seen his group take has gone up. That is why this never fell below .78 range today. He told his group to load anything. 80 range and buy all dips! Fundamentals, technicals, secondary offerings at this point are all IRRELEVANT. ALSO reddit is pumping the volume as well. Folks.... THIS. IS. GOING . TO RISE! I hope this information helps you feel at ease. I have seen these guys operate. Zack Morris was behind the $AMC run up before WSB even noticed it. I'm telling you, get on board and enjoy the ride. The first price target is 2$ And from there it could take on a life of its own like $GME if people reload their short positions and well all know they will! Good luck have a great weekend. You to shorts, feel free to borrow my shares so you can cover at 1.23 Monday morning. Cheers!!"
Next on the list is $GERN. Solid. Hugely shorted. Great company. Look it up.
Its irrational to see the Redditors supporting entertainment companies like $GME & $AMC to save them from excessive shorts and lag their support to $BB & $INO with meaningful products with huge impact on technology and Medicine. Shorting is allowed by SEC to increase liquidity and discipline overvalued securities or companies with improper accounting but continues shorting in +100% is unjustified. At the same time the support to save tangible companies from too much shorting must be focused on the content of their products & services rather than your favourite video games or movie places. Think wisely to support betterness of human life and ending pandemic with your fortunate investment. Think of those thirsty and hungry kids in unfavourable corners of globe. Invest in meaningful companies and you shall enjoy your gains & profits.

"Short damage control is so easy to snuff out, lol. LOOK GUYS, OTHER STOCK, BUBBLE ABOUT TO POP GUYS, BETTER GET OUT!!! Nothing will shake us out. Yesterdays artificial dip didn't do it, NOTHING will make us let go. Accept that you have lost, you have been beaten at the ONE thing you're probably good at and now you're finally going to lose for once. They're having such cute little temper tantrums. All of them probably sitting at their computers, red in the face, sweating bullets, on the verge of heart attack as they watch their efforts to shake us out fail again and again. This is war and we are winning."
"Short selling is wrong. Ruins a company from false claims. It’s refreshing seeing something like this happen to the big funds. Lol. I think Shopify will be next. It’s already up 1,159 percent over a short period. I got a feeling they will drive it up to over 15,000 a share in a few months. And Shopify is a brilliant company"
IGNORE THE NAYSAYERS STAND YOUR GROUND WE ARE THE PEOPLE
"""I keep hearing that 'most of the GME shorts have covered' — totally untrue,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3′s managing director of predictive analytics, said in an email. ""In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn't moved all that much."""
"Today’s lesson ...... The general process: You borrow shares from your brokerage and sell them at the current market price (which, again, you think will fall). Ideally, your view is correct, and when the price has dropped, you buy shares at that lower cost to pay back the ones you borrowed. A simplified illustration: You short a $7 stock. It slides in price, and you buy it at $2. Your profit is $5.However, if the price goes up, at some point you still would need to finish the transaction — that is, you'd have to buy that stock to repay the brokerage. So if that $7 stock starts rising, and you buy it at $10 to cover your short position, you've lost $3.Some people are going to make a lot of money. But there will be people who … get in and lose their shirt.""Ivory JohnsonFOUNDER OF DELANCEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT""Most investors think of risk being only on the downside,"" said CFP Matt Canine, senior wealth strategist with East Paces Group in Atlanta. ""When you buy a stock outright, your losses are finite — if you buy at $100 and it goes to zero, you lost $100.""But if you short it and it goes to $200, $300, $400 etcetera, your losses are compounded,"" Canine said. ""The risk on the upside is unlimited."" When a stock is heavily shorted, and investors are buying shares — which pushes the price up — short sellers start buying to cover their position and minimize losses as the price keeps rising.This can create a ""short squeeze"": Short sellers keep having to buy the stock, pushing the price up even higher and higher. (This is what happened with the shorted stocks targeted by the Reddit investing crowd)."

"If you read between the lines of the SEC press release, they are anticipating a follow-on offering from the board. They are also clear that they want to protect retail longs from price manipulation.I could be wrong, but my bet is that the shorts cover into an issuance over the weekend at an agreed price. I think there are various waiting periods and the like for follow-on offerings.This is a fundamentally healthy transaction for the US economy, for longs, and for shorts. I am not saying we will get out at $1420.69 or whatever or that some longs won't be disappointed. I'm saying that (1) whatever price the shorts cover into will probably be at least as high as what nearly every reasonable retail investor has paid but is not exploitative, (2) my guess is the price on Monday morning will be higher than what the shorts covered at (3) we're going to have a high quality blue-chip stock coming out of this that will be a lot more accretive to the economy than $25B sitting in vulture short positions at hedge funds.$300 is a value for this stock and a not bad price for it to catch a bid.Just don't get greedy and bid the price up. The SEC is quietly asking retail longs and the board to behave like adults today-- but it goes both ways-- the funds have to do the same thing."

Hey guys 113%shorts are sold for 113% longs + we have original 100% longs. Total is 113% shorts vs 213% longs.
to all you traders out there think about this what's the real valuation of gme. at some point it will return to a normal sure price based on valuations. it only makes sense to short the stock at this price due to declining sales and declining revenues and profits.

Float is only around 50 million shares. 100% + are shorted. so there is a total shortage of stock. this means any buying will push it up because there is no supply. just keep the demand and pressure on buy holding and putting orders in to buy. this can only go up now.

There much better companies we could short squeeze after this one. Such as great biotech companies that literally save lives and are on the verge of bankruptcy due to high cost of R&D and lack of financial resources. If you want to give the short seller a lesson at least do it through biotech companies who save lives and add some moral to the story too Short selling a clothing brand does not hurt people but short selling biotech companies is so disgusting. Give short sellers of biotech companies a good lesson and send messages on WallStreetBet and ask them to choose biotech companies after this one. $pmcb $sens $avgr $clsn $celz
It's so obvious how desperate the shorts are before tomorrow's call. They're throwing everything they can to drop the price on GME. Hold strong until EOD tomorrow!
Most undervalued company in the world. Infinite upside
"Short positions may be in the form of options and with the volatility so high the extrinsic option premiums are also really high. Options positions can be rolled forward by selling the shorter expiration date and buying the longer date. This provides dual benefit of allowing more time for the position to payback and also captures more time value. As prices rise, the cost of sustaining the stock price requires more and more capital to be infused. Short positions are not all on margin, however with the meteoric rise in this stock, many short positions could trigger margins calls if the holder does not have enough assets to cover. Anyone holding options is incurring time value depreciation while anyone writing options is accruing time value appreciation. This favors anyone writing options as long as they are able to trade as needed and have enough assets to cover. Selling covered calls could be lucrative as long as the stock does not crash during the holding period. Selling naked calls could be more lucrative, but you need plenty of capital to back the trade in case of further meteoric price rise. Also, you need to be sure you can trade freely to avoid being stuck with a position that expires in the money."
"SEC just posted Robinhood can only trade OTC stocks , while review is completed."

"From wallstreetbets:MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKDIt’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all."

"MarkA had a fantastic post and completely agree with his commentary, strongly recommend his read. One of the stocks I'm heavily invested in (ticker: GOGO) is also heavily shorted, greater than 40%. As the stock started rising quite a bit earlier this week on the momentum of retail investors, TWO analysts posted, on the same day, that the stock was overvalued and the price fell significantly from $16.50 Wednesday morning to $12.50 Thursday morning. However, the business has some significant opportunity for growth after selling its commercial aviation business, including restructuring its debt to a much lower rate given the lower risk in the business, not to mention development efforts in the 5G network. Rather than waiting for GOGO to issue revised guidance in the coming months, these two analysts decided to issue their reports just as the stock was gaining momentum. What was the motive or rush to issue the report devaluing the stock when new guidance will become available within the next couple of months? Just like GME, wallstreet protects its interest first without considering the impact on retail investors, but then expect a bailout from retail investors (from the government, funded by tax payers) when they ultimately fail. In addition to the above commentary, Robinhood also appeared to have blocked trading in GOGO stock! It absolutely feels like market manipulation. This movement against GME, GOGO, and other unnecessarily heavily shorted stocks must carry on!"

As most of you know there were a lot of shorted stock options out there like BB,KOSS,BBY,and NAKD.

Hmmm don’t you think the original shorts closed out. Melvin Capital closed short position on Tuesday at a big loss. What your possibly seeing is new shorts at much higher prices. If someone shorted this at $450. The disaster is coming.

The squeeze has not started.
Since the stock got to $500 and the institional players are still in short positions I don’t believe they will be forced to buy back their shares since they. have deep pockets and Go heavy into marginTherefore shortly this stock is going to plummet once we stock speculating on it and look at the company’s financials
I bought 100 shares at 150 because I want to be part pf the movement. 15 grand is nothing in my portfoilo. I hope the RH guys win on this. The hedge funds have had their way for too long.
Set sell limit at $1000. Dropped $25000 on gme . Diamond  hands  till then.

"If you think these Wall Street ""rich elites"" are going to ""submit and cover"" within a few days, after they have been in 100% FULL CONTROL of the stock markets, real estate markets, commercial real estate markets, 401k's, etc, etc for DECADES, then you don't understand the depths of their ""rich elite entitlement"". They are NOT going to give in, they never have had to because they can ""manipulate"" the market to make certain THEY WIN in the end. Well guess what, as a 40 year wall street investor myself I can assure you that ""this time IS VERY DIFFERENT"". You've got a situation that Wall Street didn't think could ever happen - little investors group together in the millions to produce a wave of money that Wall Street cannot fight against, then these little investors target one stock with a massive short position outstanding combined with a small tight float, and they purposely buy that stock up together as a group so no one single person is risking hardly any of their personal net worth (because they don't have much net worth), and together this equals a nightmare dilema for WS. They either go against the LAWS & RULES and OPENLY CHEAT in order to win, OR they lose 100's of billions and maybe trillions of dollars to this RAPIDLY GROWING LITTLE INVESTORS GANG who are calling their bluff at Wall Street's very own game.This is going to collapse Wall Street shortly without cheating intervention, which we've already seen happening. Either way Wall Street loses big here. They either completely lose the trust of the entire world by cheating when it's clear they've lost at their own game, OR they lose all their money as this gang of little investors moves from one stock to the next with the same MO.Haha wall street rich elite democRat voting globalists who own MOST of the real estate on the coasts, YOU PEOPLE are skeeeee-rewwww'd this time. Hold on little investors, they will fight you to THEIR END because their ARROGANCE will never let them realize the trouble they truly are in right now. Don't stop, you've got ALL the cards in your deck and they have NONE.Yes! Wreck them!

my 3 year old brother told me not to even touch the sell button all week next week. he actually said to not even look at the stock until the following week as the short squeeze won't happen until later as the hedge funds try to wait out and buy shares cheaper. the longer they wait the longer the premiums they pay. when they realize it's not going anywhere they will be forced to buy at what ever price is set. so to my little brother I said I won't sell. I will hold strong. I will hold until I die

However, I want to remind you. I have only one rule. I HOLD.YOU CHEAT...I HOLDYOU LIE...I HOLDYOU MANIPULATE...I HOLDYOU BREAK RULES...I HOLDI HOLD...And indeed, you may have won a day last week. You even left some ‘holding the bag’. But when the day comes, and it will…THAT BAG WILL BE YOURS. YOU picked this fight, and you will finish it.

"just to be fair because you are bragging my friend Glad :), your short come super positive because of this news:Alex WilhelmThu, January 28, 2021, 3:30 PM·2 min readUpdate: Robinhood has made public note of the changes, stating that ""in light of recent volatility"" it is ""restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK."" The company added that it has ""raised margin requirements for certain securities.""So it is quite much luck I would say :), redditors were killed with this, but who could know that? I did not know."
I dont think it's right that some platforms are now restricting trading of the stock. What if you bought in at $300.00 you cant buy cheaper shares to bring your cost basis down? It works both ways.
this is my own personal assumption. Robinhood yesterday helped their partner hedge fund cover the short at a lower price. SEC should fine and put those people in jail if thats the case
"Bill Ackman didn't believe Andrew Left about Valeant Pharmaceuticals. It cost him almost $4 billion. Yep, Left is always beating up on those small retail investors."

15 minutes to glory warriors. This is a global movement. Stay steady and push them into a corner! Buy and hold!!!
They let the funds sell to each other to tank price without halting yet everytime it tries to go up they halt it.Lol ok thats fair
"No surprise about the timing. Friday, is when they need to pay-up. Bottom line is if they are short and don't own the stock and need to buy it back on the exercise date, the stock holder sets the price. That is why they (Hedge Funds/ Big Guys) demanded that they shut it down today. Now they #$%$ off a small army and this thing is going to 1000. I just got in for the fun of it. This is historic. I don't have many shares so good luck to all. It was boring sitting on the sidelines."
"No halts no dips, wonder why!? We’ll open at 500 plus tomm morning. Hold guys!!"
why would anyone short these anymore so how will you get a short squeeze moving forward $AMC $GME

Citadel/Robinhood limiting buying again. Short ladder attack incoming. It's power hour HODL time!!!
$GME Congrats all  for holding the line. Just before market close they might pull it down like yesterday. Keep holding!! We meet on Monday again. Rinse repeat until 
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRIED TO LOCK US OUT AND SCARE US THEY LOST. WEAK HANDS FELL BUT THOSE WHO STAYED STRONG REAP THE BENEFITS. THIS WILL NO DOUBT HIT 2k BY MONDAY KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING
No skin in the game here but I want to thank all of the crazy gamestop action for causing the rest of the market to turn red likely for short sellers selling their winners to cover their short positions. Lots of well run companies that pay dividends discounted heavily. The only long position I will pick up are those companies so thanks for the discounts to be had elsewhere.

"Get SHOrtY.....A margin call occurs when the value of an investor's margin account falls below the broker's required amount. An investor's margin account contains securities bought with borrowed money (typically a combination of the investor's own money and money borrowed from the investor's broker). A margin call refers specifically to a broker's demand that an investor deposit additional money or securities into the account so that it is brought up to the minimum value, known as the maintenance margin.A margin call is usually an indicator that one or more of the securities held in the margin account has decreased in value. When a margin call occurs, the investor must choose to either deposit more money in the account or sell some of the assets held in their account."
Sold my shares when they were at $400 today. Made almost 1 million which i am happy. I invested in secured bug company stocks which will provide me with 70k a year interest. I guess i am happy.
don't forget. the shorts have to start covering soon. starting near the end of today or early next week. I'm buying more at this dip. they need to buy millions to cover!!

Buy hold. Will go much higher
"hi all, where can I short Melvin Capital? All in , YOLO."
For all you Robinhood hodlers. You can open a brokerage account with someone else and transfer shares out of Robinhood without selling. Look it up. Costs a little bit of money and usually your new broker will cover the cost to transfer. Screw Robinhood. Move to someone better. Free market always wins and these criminals deserve to see their platform starve.
I love this stock

"Don't listen to people advertising other stocks here. Gamestonk only, don't dilute."
"I've Noticed a Trend With the Media.Okay, I've been watching this fiasco for nearly two days now. To say that it hasn't gave me extreme amounts of joy would be an understatement. As a big victim of the 2008 crash this has been glorious.That being said there's a few things that I've noticed. And I'd like to give them my two cents.One thing is with the media and with Robinhood.So what they are doing right now is damage limitation. If you think the media is your friend then you are sorely mistaken. Anything that's detrimental to financial elite just wouldn't be talked about. The fact that most media outlets are talking about it means that they know they're screwed. They know they've lost with $GME. It's going to the moon, you know it, they know it, it's out. BAMSo what they are doing next is mitigating their losses. If you look at all the media they are practically telling you what to pump your last dime into. Yay, they are saying. Stick it to the big man. We are on your side! They say.Now if we analyse the actions of Robinhood there are two stocks I've actively heard and saw on twitter of them closing people's positions without their authorisation. That is $gme, and $nakd. They could have done it to the others as well, but I haven't seen it yet.You know what the media aren't talking about? $Nakd. You know why? Because this stock is another one they've shorted the #$%$ out of. Looks like they want to continue to do it too because the media are saying,""Hey little man, look at these widely known stocks, the rich are crying. Boo hoo. Let's stick it to them""Let's be honest here. We might have pulled off the financial wealth transfer of the decade, but they're not dumb enough to let it happen twice. One thing I've learned in my age old wisdom is to do the opposite of what the indoctrination box tells me. It's served me well.$Nakd is on the list. It's being bought up by us in the thousands, people are sticking their life savings on it.....but it's not being talked about anywhere in the media.And Robinhood are actively closing people's positions on it.That tells me to stick more into it. And get more people on board.But obviously please don't listen to me because I get all my financial information from my six year old sister and I was dropped on my head at birth. Anything I say should be treated as fiction because I am the village idiot where I live.And please do your due diligence when making financial transactions that can have an impact on your life."
Funny how Gamestop is actually stopping this fraudulent game these hedgefunds are playing. LOL

"Interactive brokers continues to block all new option trades on GME. They will let you close your existing positions but you can't put anything new on there. They will however let you buy or sell the stock, although margin requirements are much increased. Thomas Peterffy, interactive broker CEO, says he's trying to ""protect market integrity."" I don't know what he means by that. All I know is that I was trying to make money, and then he said no."

"PPS will continue to rise so long as a lot of investors still believe the ""Stick It To The Hedge Funds"" movement is still going strong. Unfortunately, for those who started buying in the past few days thinking the pps is heading north of $500 or even higher, you are gonna be the ones to get killed. Believe me, the smart guys who started this have already sold and are long gone. That's why you see the pps hovering around $325-$330 without those huge swings you saw earlier in the week. MMs are now finding it easier to match their Buy and Sell orders. Might see an artificial boost late in the day as MMs might need to buy more shares to cover call options that expire today. But come next week, this party is gonna be winding down because the pizza is cold, the kegs are nearly empty and someone just pulled the cord on the music. To wit, say goodnight. It's time to go home."
Just to clarify... we all know this is a $20 stock trading well above its station. Some comments suggest we don’t realise this. WE DO! This isn’t about the true value of the stock. It’s about exposing corruption that lets the elite profIt while the average Joe suffers. It’s a movement. We are not here to analyse the fundamentals or the PE ratio. We are here to make a stand together as one. #moonday

"Okay. Time for the Hedge Funds and Prime Brokers to be big boys, call up the investment bankers, sit down with the GME board and cut a deal in principal for new shares to be issued. (I understand that there is some sort of a waiting period for doing a follow-on offering).Cash deposited *THIS WEEKEND*. IOUs issued at the same time.All-or-nothing. Either we issue the short interest, or we issue zero and you guys deal with this mess on Monday morning when retail investors start asking for stock certificates.Let's figure out a reasonable price where nobody is being too greedy, but longs have the cash position and the bargaining power. I think the Wednesday high is a fair and reasonable price.GME announces the deal Sunday night, this thing *probably* rallies 10% from where the issue-- sorry, agreement in principal-- was priced at. Check clears Sunday night. Period. You guys are JP Morgan and Bank of America-- figure it out. Shares to be issued in principal ought to be acceptable collateral on some level.Let's Save Retail."
"Jordan Belfort ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" advises WallStreetBets Investors to back good companies that actually have a future.

It is primed to move higher. Institutional Ownership is rising every day and is up to 591 institutions as we speak. It currently has 37% of the shares (over 62 million) being shorted. It is a solid long term stock to hold and ride upward similar to AMZN or TSLA did. They have also raised their projected revenue for 2024 upward 3 times to now $1.7 BILLION. PLUG is a better investment than GME, AMC, or BBBY and it has one of the best and most informative boards on Yahoo Finance. Congrats to those that have made good profits in GME...Now use those profits to invest and make more in PLUG."
Hold! This back over 300 in a few minutes!
HOLD on to your shares boys & gals. They will use dirty techniques to drive the price down. Weeklies are expiring today & they have to buy back GME shares. DO NOT SELL!!

OMG Here we go again.
GME to the Moon
make sure you have GTC sell orders at at least $1000 so they cant lend your shares for shorts.
"Hold the line. $GME, $AMC, $EXPR, $BB"
Protect free markets. Punish Robinhood.I really have no position in GME but 100% support what you are all doing.
"Okay listen very carefully, like this so everyone sees it. Over the weekend, shorts, bashers and bots will be out in force with trying convincing arguments as to why you should sell. Some of these guys will come in the form of pretend shareholders acting like they care about you saying that they too themselves are going to sell on Monday. Do not listen to them or pay them any mind. This is the time that will now separate the boys from the men. RH is in trouble, they are losing millions of users over the weekend and guess what those users will be doing next week? Switching to more reputable brokers and buying. This is a global trend now, there's no hiding the fact that the manipulation and corruption is happening on a much larger scale. I hold NAKD and AMC CURRENTLY because I like the companies and what they are doing. I'm not intelligent, I get my advice from my 6 year old sister. WSB. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC"

"We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.�Do I have your attention? Here goes:Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and #$%$ retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants#$%$ fear.Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user (u/zshub) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?�It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.Listen to this�to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.Remember the movie Snowpiercer?

Only question is will you be onboard or will be clapping from the ground"
"Those hedge fund guys are supposedly worried we are gonna get hurt? I used $9600 of my own money today to hurt them. I am prepared to not sell this forever just to sink their ship. This amount of money is not small, but I will support the cause for our future.Apparently the only time retail investors can ""suffer"" is when they decide we suffer because in the late 1990's they were the ones who pumped out all the junk stock IPO's (fake money literally) and declared strong buy on everything while they sold it.Now they claim SPAC's are dangerous because SPAC's are not vetted and held to the same standard? What standard did they have in 2000?Then the financial crisis of 2008 which they used all our money to gamble and peddle junk and destroyed our economy.Now in 2020 they are allowed to short sell shares beyond the total that exist to crush it to ZERO and never having to buy it back? It is their smugness that allowed them to get to this point. I am grateful to WallStreetBets for exposing themLook at the way they choose to fight now. Limit our ability to buy? Of course that artificially creates a ""no buyer"" available to sink the stock. This is beyond rigging!"

"Question: If it takes trading 56 million shares during the regular session to drop it from265 to 194, how many shares does it take after hours to lift it from 194 to 312? Answer: Not many. Because the innocents here have it as an article of faith that you must not sell the stock since this traps the big players. They don't see that the big players are the ones driving it up after hours in order to sell them worthless call options. Most of which will expire worthless tomorrow."
"Some of you seem to have misunderstood the ""hold"" part of ""buy and hold"". IT'S NOT TOO LATE! TOMORROW ALL IN"

"2) more to follow reverse order see posts by me below. watOK, listen up, you late-to-the-party, crayon-eating homunculus, here's what's going on:Over the past year, hedge fund supervillains have made money by selling shares of Gamestop they don't actually own - they've just borrowed them. Short selling. If they sell enough they can drive the price down so far that when they eventually need to return the shares they borrowed, they can get them cheap. It's free money. They throw a couple hundred mil at this, chill in their offices watching live video feeds of homeless people being exsanguinated on the hoods of their vintage sports cars, write up an investor report, and call it a fiscal year.They borrowed and sold a record amount - they sold more shares, in fact, than are actually traded, far more than Gamestop's float. This shouldn't have been allowed to happen and probably means they were selling shares they never even bothered to borrow - naked shorts. (Where were you on that one, SEC?) Essentially, they were simultaneously betting on Gamestop going bankrupt and doing their best to drive them into bankruptcy. It's a good tactic when you need to find a way to pay for your old wife's alimony and your new wife's poolboy.But it presents an opportunity for the savvy degenerate gambler. Because these shares eventually need to be returned - after all, it does cost these funds money to borrow a share. And the higher the price goes, the more unstable it becomes, the more it costs to borrow. This means that at some point, they need to buy back those borrowed shares they sold."

"Hi friends, do you know what time the shorts will have to buy shares?"
"RepostTo the people who argues that Nokia does not has enough short ratio to spark a rally like GME, I hope we can reason it out with some simple math:The market cap for GME is <1B. With a 80% short, the hedges get to make ~800M in the event that the stocks get utterly eviscerated. If share prices double, the hedges will lose 800M. This is what it means in dollar terms. Nokia might only have 10% shorts, but with a market cap of 23B, the hedges basically has a 2.4B bet - 3 times that of what they have on GME. TLDR: If the masses have our way, NOK will be more painful for the hedges than GME. Mpreover, there are mounting evidences that the funds are paying to attention to Nokia. (1) Recall the halt that happened 2 nights ago right after prices shot up to 9.79? Prices crashed immediately thereafter. It was obvious that certain circuit breaker measures were triggered by some large players. Measures to scare us off that is. (2) 1B volume traded in a single day and prices stay flat. It is obvious some big players were able to stagnate the prices with ladder trading. Likewise, scare tactics. (3) After hours crashes - only hedge funds can do after hours trade, so why the crash? It is obvious they don't want the price to rise and they are scaring us off with low volume dips. (4) Why was NOK singled out alone with other reddit stocks for a ban if the hedges were not concerned?Hold your lines guys. We are on the verge of victory."
What’s best about this is al the guys screaming “hold” at $280...don’t understand the the ones who talked them into this were out at $100.
Why are all stocks trading at or near their price on a Friday night? This does not seem like a free market

"I am gonna keep a stake in GME because I hate institutional short selling. It screws real investors - ownership, employees, and other stake holders. The folks on TV just don't get it ... why GME among others are killing it.They do rightly warn that at these prices someone is going to get hurt, left holding the bag (folks that buy in at this price). What they don't get is that just like hedge funds spend millions on politicians to get favorable legislation, a lot of what we are doing is like us sending Bernie $15. We buy GME in hopes of making a buck but also to stick it to the system. That said, I have moved some funds to APRN. Just like AMC, GME and KOSS, APRN was mentioned as one of the six low cap plays that are manipulated heavily by shorts. https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/01/reddit-traders-squeeze-gamestop-these-stocks-could-be-next/They have moved up from 7 to about 10 this week. Shorts have beaten the #$%$ out of the stock. Should be at 40. Happy hunting."

HOLD the line - Prices go up tomorrow when options expire and market makers have got to deliver.

Citadel owns part of Robinhood and pays them for customer data. They have huge influence over them. That’s why they stopped allowing purchase of GME. Time to sue and exit this platform altogether.

"This week of earnings far exceeded expectations... greater than 90% of companies beat expectations.

But here how it can work out (per S3)Let's say A is long and owns 1 share. He lends his share to B. B short sells to C. C is also long. C then lends to D. D shorts to E. E is also long. The end result: 1 original long, 2 synthetic longs and 2 shorts. Short Interest % Float = 2/1 or 200%. Actual Short Interest % Float = 2/(1+2) or 66%"
Lets liquidate some hedge funds today by holding GME stock.DO NOT SELL
"I just want you all to know that after hearing about Robinhood blocking buying of GME, I bought shares of GME today.... I dont care if they go to zero... I'll never sell them. I consider it a donation to the church of capitalism reform. Cheers everyone!"
Lol here come the bots again.Buy more and shoo them away. If this closes above 300 again we’re gonna be laughing

"GME, the roof is on fire. "
"Alright fact check to you all feeling good dis morning. GME 226 short% of float, AMC 38.12%. $GME 2.78 put/call ratio $AMC 1.63. GME days to cover 2.81 AMC 1.17. AMC is the next highest in potential within all the other stocks people diverted in. Only if people did some research, they wouldn't be bleeding bad. We have a long way to go my AMC fwends. good luck to $GME as well. & stop posting other stocks no one gives my grandmothers poop."
GameStop win!!!!!
Hard to sell what you got when nobody can buy. Merrill Lynch is blocking new orders too.

Buy more! Discount of a lifetime! Hedge funds going boom
low volume pricee manipulation?
"Concept #2 (see prior posts to learn more on this)> Data on short squeeze> the fall (after the pump) happens 70% of the time in ONE trading day. That means that 1- If you are long and already made a lot of money (not measured in $$$ but in %) you should be closing your position and celebrating / 2- you cannot day-trade this, because if you buy the deep and get caught in the sharp fall, you won't even have the time to sell (no one will be buying). PS> I don't have a short position."
WE LITERALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE SELL BUTTON IS ON THE APP

How nice of Robbinhood to limit your buys to 1 share at a time. What a bunch of (_o_)'s.
Robinhood about the be the #1 installed app and the #1 uninstalled app in the same day lol
"Think of this: TSLA hasn't come down. GME doesn't have to come back to earth. This thing is a movement now. You can hold this for weeks, months. It's like bitcoin. Hold baby. My GME limit is set to 1000."

"If you need to sell, don't sell it all at once, sell in small portions on different days in an uptrend, don't sell on a down trend, the shorts need to cover their position and will keep bidding and buying higher and higher"
Today is the last day for the hedge funds to win. They will throw everything they can at us. They can force takedown reddit or stop GME from trading for some time. In that case: HOLD THE LINE and be STRONG if we survive this there is nothing stopping us
1000 USD NO PENNY LESS
Anybody knows the shorts covered today or what the short percentages
Hold! Let this to 500!
What can we expect on Monday?
DO NOT SELL ONLY BUY!!!
"Just posted on C-Net: Robinhood explained the move in a blog post Thursday morning, just before the stock exchanges opened: ""In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK."
No selling until monday! The price will skyrocket today when the hedge funds buy back the shares they borrowed!
Never selling
People trading in margins with Robin Hood are bankrupting the casino. The casino may have to shut down because they can’t cover their losses.

"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."
"UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALLHOLD THE LINE"
"How did we allow stocks that no one had a clue about, such as $NOK $BBBY $AAL and crypto like Dogecoin to scatter us away from the original plan? We're not pumpers, we're opportunists, and that opportunity lay with $BB and still does. We know the potential of this company, the deals they're closing, the solid plans they have in place to propel themselves leagues ahead of many of these pumped stocks.Today, we let $BB bleed and failed to keep it above the $15 target to defeat the shorts before calls expired. $GME and $BB were in this together, alongside one another, making each other undefeatable, yet today $GME pulled ahead (congratulations) whilst $BB faltered.I urge all of my fellow investors to ponder upon our original plans as a community, before the hype clouded everyone's judgement. From the beginning we knew who the winners were, yet now we have forgotten."

"There much better companies we could short squeeze after this one. Such as great biotech companies that literally save lives and are on the verge of bankruptcy due to high cost of R&D and lack of financial resources. If you want to give the short seller a lesson at least do it through biotech companies who save lives and add some moral to the story too Short selling a clothing brand does not hurt people but short selling biotech companies is so disgusting.

Buy and hold!!!
Can someone answer this? Why is tomorrow (Friday) such an important day? Should I invest before then?
what you guys dont get is that if we squeeze them they literally have to buy these stocks at whatever price you have your sell order set too

Turns out that Robin Hood was actually working for Prince John the whole time. Now you get back in line and obey.
BUY HEDGES OUT BUYOUT DIAMOND HANDS!!!!

"the support so strong today, the hedgers are possibly pumping it up again do not sell, hold hold hold"
still halted. isnt this illegal?
Oh I get it. Robinhood has to FUND the entire cost of a stock purchase for 2 full days until it clears. And they can NOT use customer funds to do it. So they are screwed with the huge influx of orders. They don't have the funds to pay for the orders! That's why they are maxing out their credit lines.
GME a buy at 350?
GUYS TDAMIERTRADE IS NOW OPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!COPY PASTE AND POST THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"If hedge funds get away with this, imagine what will happen to all of your other holdings.. they can short it at will, with no repercussions..."

I set a sell limit at 5k off of the advise of a thread I read to prevent your broker from loaning out your shares. I learned today that the open ended order had been cancelled claiming that the limit was set too high. Make sure to check yours if you had one set.

What would happen if every day some of us bought more game stop until it reached 100 trillion market cap? Maybe gamestop could buy the central bank jk
Friday PAY day!!
Why suddenly so many bot bashers?
"I think it would be really funny if $GME recapitalized through a direct placement offering or two and redeveloped their business model with the cash. I can just see them calling around, ""We'll give you 100% of your short debt in shares for 90% of your capital""."
Changing rules in the middle of the night where have we seen that before?
"My Schwab acct would not let me place a buy when the price dipped to $126. For what little it's worth, EVERYBODY should lodge a complaint with SEC and their brokerage firm. They denied me the opportunity to buy low and sell high -- isn't that what it's all about??"
"Look I feel I need to break this down especially for new people. The Float is 34 million shares because Cohen bought 13% with the option to go to 20% however he publicly has not came out probably due to this all out war. Anyway that leaves a tradeable float at 34 million and you have 71 million shares short. Then you NOW have 2.2 million CALLS all IN THE MONEY. That's 220 million shares so the market makers and others are net short this stock 291 million - 34 million float for a total of 257 million net short. There is NOT enough shares to go around plain and simple. The float is shorted by about 8X and they are completely stuck. They are doing everything to talk this stock down through media, print, TV internet even these boards are full of these paid shills to get you to sell. It's all a scare tactic. They stopped selling the CALLS today because they finally looked at the numbers and had a epiphany of how bad it really is. Ameritrade stopped trading in it. It's a HUGE game of manipulation and you know what I AM NOT SELLING. These funds that wrote the CALLS and shorted the stock are liquidating a lot of other positions to bring this down. Don't get manipulated by them. These shares are golden and soon you will be able to name your own price"
"Hedge funds still have to cover their position. and will do so after hours when they realise this is the best price they will get! Dont sell, dont make the stock cheap for them. hold and cash in once every single short trader has purchased it will make the stock go high again!"
Don’t know with GoPro $GPRO the short ratio is going up as analysts slice their price target to something lower like from 7 to 5.50 when they were not right on the first target in the first place and the stock hits new recent highs. Billionaires helping billionaires. GPRO deserves to be the next $GME but those billionaires can put their money where there mouth is because they got it. Manipulation at its finest like in$GME $AMC $IRBT $DDD before the jump $PLCE All these should have the SEC investigating the short hedge funds and their friends helping them out at the brokerage houses
"Interactive Brokers chairman Thomas Peterffy told CNBC Thursday the broker’s decision was to protect the market and the clearing house, the body responsible for the trusted transfer of securities and funds between the buyer and seller. Robinhood, however, has its own clearing system."
"I have been watching this-- as a professional trader I commend what has taken place. How can Robing hood discriminate ""buys "" and ""sells"". This is not North Korea-- this is a democracy, and freedom of exchanges and trading. If a short is stupid enough to go naked and put millions at risk, and the little retail guy gets 3M traders to buy, that's life. All I can say is someone or many people are going to me millionaires, and many hedge funds or shorts will file Chap 11. That's what a market is for. Good luck to you guys."
If the price keeps falling they will be able to short! Buy and hold GME!
Solution is to forbid short-sell in the first place (not just for GME).
2 hours people! This is the final push. Hold to the finish line. The rocket leaves at market close. 
"I am thinking that tomorrow will be very telling. If the stock moves up a lot, then there is still a high percentage of short shares outstanding. Unless someone can tell us where to look for the current short %, I'm thinking that the best we will be able to do to gauge it is by watching what the stock does tomorrow. Does anyone have any insight into the current short %?"
I love the stock.
"34MM float and showing 400MM in trade volume yesterday. With many retail investors holding, are the same 5MM shares flipping back and forth 100 times?This is absurd activity on the back-end."
Who said it wasn’t going back to 300?.
"$325 close, good effort, I am flat on the day personally but the squeeze should commence next week, in for another wild ride from Monday"
Buy and hold boys
"They COVERED or got a Bailout from Other Institutions. GME Diluted The Shares to Balance Everything Out Yesterday when The BUYING was Halted. The time to sell was at $500+ Yesterday. Remember, this has NOTHING to do with Loosing Money even ALL of it. This is about Drawing Attention to Regulators and Legislators to Stop The Market Manipulation etc....... Don’t give Novice Investors FALSE HOPE That They are going to make BIG MONEY. The BIG MONEY cashed out Yesterday and Prior Day.. It’s Over and CONGRATULATIONS on Accomplishing The Mission!!! THIS IS ALL THE TALK EVERYWHERE AND CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!"
Today’s volume is so funny. They didn’t let us buy and just changed hands among themselves to scare us. Actually they are scared of us. So just buy and hold. It is not going to the moon actually it is going to the Mars.
"$AMC is a buyMONDAY, if $AMC closes above $10 today all the calls expire in the money and market makers will be forced to buy shares back therefore on Monday the price would rocket starting the AMC short squeeze, copy and paste this so people know how long to buy and hold for!"

Is it true that they are out 1 billion for every 10 bucks? That's 19 billion dollars already today! Plus the majority of the 19 billion market cap since they over shorted by greater than 100%. Just an incredible turn of events!
"take this stock to 500, game on."

We LIKE THE STOCK!!
I hope you people close over $400 tomorrow.

"What happened today is an unacceptable precedent and will be talked about for a long time. Robinhood under pressure from the sharks of finance has in fact manipulated the market, no longer allowing the purchase of GME shares! The corruption of finance has once again come to the surface by colliding with small investors. When it's the big ones who manipulate the markets then it's okay, when it's the small ones then it's no longer okay. There will be repercussions."
Just bought more at 223. Wanted to purchase at 160 but my platform (Questrade was slow and wouldn't let me put in an order).
Where will it go today? 500$?
gonna be good tomorrow!!!
So what's gonna play out here for the rest of today's trading and tomorrow. I'm new to this so help out a 'Holder'....

They had to stop trading on some of the high volume stocks. They are allowing trading on some of these stocks tomorrow in limited basis, and possibly Monday."
GME news is now around the world... LMAO..
Cavalry is coming in! People are leaving Robinhood and going elsewhere. Buy the dip!
shorters tonight
They drove the price down all day with halts and inter broker selling and buying. They doubled down on the shorts. I’m doubling down myself and buying large.Don’t let the billionaires get away with this!

SEE THE BOUNCE BACK? YEAH WE GOING UP
If I wanted to I could buy GME on Fidelity. Fidelity is not restricting this trade. Switch to a real broker. You can still get zero commissions and fractional shares. Everyone who is using a broker who has restricted this trade should switch. So they learn to stop doing this. Make them pay.
"Buy all you can in the next 27 minutes! The desperation of the Wally's is palpable. They are very close to getting stuck with an $11B price tag on their laps.

She wil go up up  
BUY AND HOLD. Do not fall into the trap of selling due to manipulative practices.
What’s the endgame here? The shorts get squeezed—taught a lesson—but isn’t it true that each one of you taking a long position at these fundamentally insane levels ultimately does not want to lose your principal? Isn’t this ultimately a house of cards destined only to crash? Aren’t these levels only going to entice some other fund who previously wasn’t short to take a short position because of the mathematical certainty that there’s really only one way for the stock to go now? It’s amazing what you’ve done...but isn’t the endgame clear? This cause of saving the little guy is going to plunge a lot of new little guys into financial ruin. Amazing and sad.
Hard to buy the dip when their ain't no dip. HDL
when is this thing gonna dip again so I can buy??

I think the shorts are going to try to exhaust the reddit team. They are going to slowly cover their shorts. could take a year. They going to attempt to wear you out and throw in the towel one by one. This will only work if you stick to your guns and don't get tired of the trade.
Thanks guys! You're making this the short of the century. Keep pumping this company that hasn't made any money in a decade.... let's push this to $500 to $1000 a share! When I short this will be the easiest money ever made.

I broke my phone screen holding so hard!! To the moon baby 
boycott robinhood or be investigated for impending free tradin . why would such platform restrict trading but then let the big guys keep playing.
Why is Robinhood only letting me buy a whole share of gme but not fractional

Absolutely embarrassing how the professional hedge funds are whining because they got bested in the stock market. It’s a risk you take simply by being in the business. Zero respect for these corporations and the affiliated corporations who are making biased changes for the sake of successful hedge funds
I wouldn’t think for a second that this is all retail. The hedges will buy going up too
Who’s leaving Robinhood for other platforms thumbs up!!
"I’m not saying you should leave Robinhood right away. I just don’t like that they sell themselves as being for the little guy and they just took the Billionaires side and screwed the little guys by intervening in the market. Robinhood needs to be investigated and charged for this, at a minimum, a class action lawsuit needs to be filed immediately."

"GEVO has soared at an invincible pace over the recent months as the company announced the Net-Zero 1 project and hopes that the Biden administration will unleash a boom in green energy and alternative fuels. GEVO’s sound business model, and its various expansion execution projects makes it well-positioned to significantly contribute to the sustainable energy drive worldwide.GEVO already supplies sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to further support carbon neutrality goals in the aviation industry. And in commencing deliveries of renewable hydrocarbons to Trafigura, the deal could produce billions in revenue for this small company in the coming years.GEVO currently has $535 million in cash and no significant debt following a stock sale that closed earlier this week. So, GEVO should be able to fund 100% of the investment necessary for its Net-Zero 1 and various other projects.Analyst sentiment, which provides a good sense of a stock’s future price movement, is good for GEVO. Its average broker rating of 1.50 indicates favorable analyst sentiment. Wall Street analysts expect GEVO’s current year revenues and EPS to grow 10.8% and 79.8%, respectively."

"From WSB:""I've gotten my mom interested enough in this that she's been loosely following it, and she was massively confused today on how I knew not to panic sell (, obviously, but you can't really verbalize that). This is how I helped her grasp that the dip never really happened at all. It ignores or mis-analogizes certain aspects, like the fact that the shares being traded often don't even exist, but I think I'm correct on the essential mechanics.I'm Sleazy Joe and I own a buy-here-pay-here car dealership. John Blow walks in with a Cadillac Escalade he wants to sell me. John's Escalade is worth $40,000 or $50,000, but I'm never going to make money if I pay him that, so I need a way to convince him it's worth less.I have another Escalade already on the lot, and my friend Sleazy Jim owns another dealership across the street. I pick up the phone and ask Jim if he wants to buy a Cadillac Escalade for $38,000. He accepts and I fax him the title. Two minutes later, I get a call from Jim and lo and behold, he has a Cadillac Escalade to sell me for $36,000. I accept and he faxes me the title back. We keep doing this until we get to something pitiful like $8,000, and now I have something I can print off and show John to say ""I'm sorry, but the market value for your vehicle is what it is and I can't justify offering you more than that."" John doesn't have access to the specific people behind the sales he's looking at, and although he does have access to the fact that very few Escalades actually changed hands on the way down to $8,000, he probably doesn't know to look at that, let alone what it implies. So he throws his hands up and I get his $40,000 Escalade for $8,000.This is what happened today with GME. Institutions were doing incredibly volume-thin, rapid sales back & forth between themselves, at precipitously decreasing prices, because they wanted $500 (or $10,000+, depending upon how you look at it) GME for $125. What's more, they managed to get brokers to almost completely lock retail out so it couldn't correct by buying the ""dip,"" greatly increasing the amount of downward movement they were able to simulate. Importantly, it looks like they largely failed, but worse such attacks will happen as they get more desperate and longs seeing through them is the only thing that can make them continue to fail.TL;DR: Read the post, but almost none of the ""sales"" that created the GME ""dip"" today were people actually exiting their positions or day-trading. Institutions sold the stock back & forth to one another rapidly enough to create the impression of a mass sell-off, and faced almost no resistance doing so because of RH et al.'s lockout."""

"$GME $HOOD $AMC $NOK your reasoning now to limit the buys on your platform ? You have a liquidity problem ? Did the Sec make you do this ? Looks like you have a liquidity problem and conflict of interest problem. Your users are upset. Yes USERS! Yes they realize they aren’t your customers. Your customers are companies citadel. You’re a broker, so broker the trades or risk loosing your users. If you loose your users, you don’t have a business."
Not many days left for approval in GTHX. Hope Robinhood take advantage as $AME or $GME
So after we blow out all the shorts does that mean all of us retail investors win and GameStop will just keep going up?..Is Monday the last day that you can short GameStop?..Why was there just as many retail investors selling as there were buying this week??..I thought we agreed to buy and hold. Is that just how the plan was suppose to work and I was misinformed?
They want you to sell your $gme $nakd $nok and $amc because they won’t let you buy it back. Don’t let the crooks win @RobinhoodApp
"is purchasing still blocked on your respected platforms? I'm on questrade and it is delayed but they never restricted us like how robinhood, td, and wealth simple did. the reason I'm asking is bcs if trading is still blocked on these platforms, once they open up this will be bullish again. but if trading is already open, I highly doubt it reaches its highs again."
robinhood and other platforms are restricting zom to 5 shares to protect shorting hedge funds !
"If you like the stock, just keep it and stop selling. Of course we knew that was the line you were putting out. You liked the scheme not the stock. You were caught running a ponzi scheme. Face it."

If the SEC attempts to criminalize WSB while ignoring the obviously criminal market manipulation by Citadel/Melvin/Robinhood they will end up kicking a massive hornets nest of retail investors already tired of their double standards.

So to the new investors who think the time to sell is at Friday close, HOLD.WARNING: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice I am but a #$%$ in a propellor hat?GME TO THE MOON?"
Not selling one share until inifinty squeeze. Then perhaps $4000 SP is reasonable exit price.
Robinhood and other platforms that blocked us from investing today need to be held accountable. We need to come together and close our investment accounts next week!
Where are the investigations for Robinhood banning people from buying AMC and $GME effectively causing the stocks to tank on Thursday so that their hedge fund friends could cover their shorts??? And how many of us lost money because of it??? These are REAL WORLD consequences from their CORRUPTION and they need to PAY!!! Robinhood and Interactive Brokers should be sued into BANKRUPTCY and anyone complicit in this CORRUPTION thrown in PRISON!!!We will let this deter us though! We WILL WIN!!!
This is a revolution. Buy if you want to be part of it
2 million shares short. NOT NORMAL! #GME #AMC #BB
I am unable to find what fund that is still shorting GME at this point since all the status of short I can find are from 1/14th. Does anyone have any idea how many short positions are still out there?
Come on retail traders show the hedge fund traders how it’s done and keep up the buying and maintain the upside
"There won't be enough money any where to pay for the fraud and illegitimacy of what was done today to small investors who were beating the whale and then were handcuffed, clubbed, muzzled and locked up....wow markets are a scam for only the big boys I guess......it ain't over until its over and it ain't gonna be over until we get paid back. Boolean"
"Hello, it is worth paying attention to Norwegian air shares, the company is preparing for the rise in the second quarter, a good buy at a good price. And the Stellantis STLA company has a great future, it would be a crime not to buy their shares.And please don`t sell GME, AMC"
"GME NOK KOSS AMC BBBY IRBT BB AAL are all being naked shorted stocks meaning big shorts and small shorts are holding 2-3 times that of the company's O/S - If longs don't sell their shares a stock can run very while, another example that KOSS went from $3 to $127 in a few days...."
Buy and hold! Do not betray your brothers. Remember we're all in this together. We can only win if we all hold!
"What upper limit? I’m thinking $20,000?"
"The $GME short squeeze is more than deserved considering the crazy short interest before all had begun.Shorts these days are causing with organizing themself in closed chatgroups – I know exactly that there are enough of them – self fulfilling prophecys. They destroy companys which probably would have a future without their organizing .The pressure for example these people put on $NIO back in the single digits days was such an organized pressure. It destroyed the already thin ground NIO was standing on despite its great business plan and vision – and only its great customers and some strong in the vision believing investors like me made NIO to survive. This downside pressure was taking away the last credibility of NIO for being able to get credits suggesting with the extreme low – manipulated – price that NIO was already a failed company, it was a lie represented by the price, caused by the lies from organized shorts and their huge short positions.But William Li and his team managed despite this aggressive attempts to destroy NIO without a reason to flip the situation with working hard and fighting out of this severe crisis. We rolled over the shorts and began to rise like a storm and with end of November, we have been in the beginning of the short squeeze right before Andrew Left came out of his cave and spreaded lies to safe his positions and the short positions of the others. And here we are now, our momentum is accelerating again and the only question is, how many lies have they left?"

I’m going down with this ship or I’m finding treasure island!!!!
"volume is low. shorts are playing games trying to scare you like short laddering. if major platforms are blocking retail from buying, then if you get scared, who do you think you're selling it to? the shorties of course."
we just gotta keep holding! we're going to the moon!

"No Buying For YouWell.. today was crazy.After the chaos of the past couple trading days, the internet gang was looking at another sky-high day of gains. That is, until the premiere of Stock Wars V: The Brokers Strike Back. Robinhood was the first broker to limit trades on “high risk” securities like $GME, $AMC, $KOSS, and the others shown below.$BB $BBBY $CTRM $EXPR $GME $KOSS $NAKD $NOK $SNDL $TR $TRVGThis limit only allowed traders to sell equities, prohibiting them from opening any new positions. Naturally, investors panicked and began to sell stocks, driving prices lower and lower. As the day continued, more and more brokers and clearing firms followed. After intense backlash from the halt (including Ted Cruz and AOC agreeing!), Robinhood later issued a statement indicating they would begin to reverse the change starting tomorrow. The Senate plans to hold a hearing on what happened today. We’ll wait and see if Washington takes action."
for the longest its been ar 332 and 335 COME ON and stop selling!!! buy buy buy

GME impacting the entire market? Then why not jump in and help out. Buy and hold. The sooner this is over.

"Since a lot of people seem eager to condemn Redditors playing the stock market, and PLAYING it, I offer this handy checklist of everything you should be sure to condemn first before them.1. Everyone on Wall Street who caused the 2008 financial meltdown from which millions have never recovered.2. Every legislator who, since the 1980s, voted for tax cuts for the rich and corporations and voted to allow Wall Street to do riskier and riskier things with pension money and combining lines of business and such.3. The handful of wealthy families and wealthy individuals on the right who, feeling scared in the 1970s, organized a sustained hijacking of the American commons, from the Powell Memo to the present, a hijacking still aloft. See the books DARK MONEY and EVIL GENIUSES.4. The philanthrocapitalists who donated some ill-gotten spoils of plutocracy and elbowed their way to the helm of Social Change, Inc., laundering their reputations, dousing anger just enough to keep the scam going, and intensifying rather than reducing their grip on public life.5. The more pliant elements of the business press, which, as the country became an oligarchy, as tens of millions began to live permanently dead-end lives because of oligarchy, completely failed to tell that story, sticking instead to the fellatial variety of journalism.6. The financial regulators who didn’t regulate but did hold out for terrific jobs later on at banks or lobbying firms. The financial-sector prosecutors who did not prosecute and also ended up working for their former targets.7. The successive White Houses that hired op executives from the economic-arson firms to firefight the problem of rising inequality.8. The private-equity firms whose entire business model was stripping companies bare, levering them up with debt and forcing them to Swiss-cheese people’s pensions, move to dynamic scheduling, outsource, subcontract, layoff, and worse.9. The universities that sold Wall Street tycoons drive-through reputational laundromat services, and did nothing as half of their graduating classes went into socially unproductive business work that was yanking inequality wider and wider and gutting opportunity."
"Could someone explain. Part of this phenomenoms fundamentals is that undelying company's stock should be relatively illiquid. But GME's market volume has been really high for a quite long time, weeks now?Why we assume unchanged ownership, unchanged ""bad"" positions of the company. Thanks."
YOU GET THE VIBE!!! 
"Many who think GME is overpriced and short think they obligated to resist such move as that their personal interest.If you smart short you can manage your lose or cover other way. This is not about bull vs bear.This is about retail vs establish.First your resistant does not stop who think buying and hold is making sure Establish pay price ( I didn't believe initially either but when they forced to stop retail trading, their true face show up)Please support movement. I am not fully long here, I have shorted puts and calls for premium. my short call kind of become cover call with some long stock + my short put, but risk always there. For example Billionaire buy in billions this can go 1000 or 2000 in no time (I will sell my long call soon or short more call for premium). I may end up losing big (I don't believe they really on this side so I will happy to get slaughter in that case because many retail investor win very big.)Also shorting call, I don't consider against cause because those call likely brought by other retail investor so money remain in retail investor hand."
Melvin Capitol is just Melvin now.
"Told ya it would go back up.If you're stressed, walk away for a while."

Robinhood should loose a lot of customers because they cannot be trusted.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Will be hopping on Twitch at 8:30pm tonight to discuss today’s developments with GameStop and retail trading. ￼
Keep it up yessss! Pushhhj!!!
I have no skin in this game and do not work on Wallstreet. I dont care if the hedge funds or retail investors win or lose. I do care that this will not end well as this will pop and retail investors will mostly take it on the chin. Then class action suits and government over regulation. This insanity is giving the politicians the excuse/crisis they need to clamp down on individual investors in the name of protecting them from themselves.
"I bought AMC strictly to hold and spread the message. Will not sell for a loss nor profit. People need to realize these funds and the way they manipulate the market through their shady, innocent-looking tactics are literally playing with and destroying peoples' lives. Wars are not only fought with weapons and ammo and this is a good example. It's not only about the money and right now you don't necessarily have to invest to stand by the movement. The people that don't understand the importance of this and quickly resort to making fun of what is going on are ought to be ashamed of themselves.$GME $NOK"
Power Hour coming!
"Hahahahaha, we’re going to Mars tomorrow lads, congrats to everyone long"
THEY ARE SCARED.... ITS READY TO GO UP AGAIN....
"Revenge of the shorts today. Everything that has a large short interest is being taken down. The good news is that they must be using up almost all of their bullets to do this. This is the time to do nothing. They are driving the price down, but they still have to buy those shares back eventually -- and with a major carrying cost of those shorted shares. I was pretty neutral about this until I see how dirty they are playing. Now I would say, wait them out because they are paying an enormous cost to short these shares. And it's also a sign of desperation on their part."
Hope Robinhood doesn't freeze people's accounts if it goes bankrupt.
"REPOST THIS EVERYWHERE PLEASE EVERYWHERE 1) Melvin Capital is the hedge fund that made this risky short sell trade on gamestop, that is losing billions of dollars.2) Melvin Capital was bailed out by Citadel.3) Citadel has a financial relationship with robinhood.4) Citadel has a financial interest in people not being able to buy $GME shares.5) Robinhood banned traders from purchasing $GME shares.THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION. PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR THIS. PEOPLE SHOULD GO TO PRISON FOR THIS."
Who is selling??? All the Hedges are working together. This will ONLY work if we all stay in. We are in this together!!
"YOU realize that there is very low volume right now? no one is selling, the price is being manipulated!"
Friday is payday. Stay the course. Shorts need to learn their lesson! 1000+ by Friday! Short squeeze in the making!
Interesting how EXACTLY 100 stocks are being sold every few seconds
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You will make $ thousand maybe $ millions !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
can we get $1500.00+ per share today at the close folks?
TOLD YOU GUYS... WE WILL SEE 300+ in AH.... whoever bring the avg down from 300 above... can recover now.. NOT WORRY >.. it's all in our hands...
Thanks a lot long you cost me a lot of money by pumping and dumping.
We will rise $GME $AMC $BB $NOK
"If we’ve learned anything from $GME It’s to hold and buy, don’t sell your shares and we will rid the shorts. Easy as that!"
"The Massive PUMP and DUMP Party is OVER! Pump and Dump Schemes GME AMC NAKD and others will COLLAPSE by 99.9999% in a few days, back to their intrinsic values before going Bankrupt! It is kind of funny, though, to see a bunch of Gamblers and chasers are copying and pasting the same Spam posts, trying to convince people to buy Bankrupt Worthless Shares of $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC . They are promoting these PUMP and DUMP Scams after an 8000% run, LOL... Ticker Gambling is a new trend, but buyers are ignoring the fact that fundamentals are the only things that matter at the end of the day. These Bankrupt GME NAKD SNDL AMC PUMP and DUMP Schemes will FALL by 99.999999%, that is a sure thing. Those buyers will lose everything and will never recover their loss because, after Massive PUMP and DUMPs, the stocks are getting PUMPED again. See Financials and do your due diligence before Ticker Gambling. These stocks are worth $0 and FALL like a ROCK very soon.KEEP GAMBLING!"
Imagine going to your broker to cover your short and he goes its on that cloud.
"I hope everyone realizes this company isn't doing well financially. This little gag will stick it to the rich and take some money from the rich, but it's creating a bubble and all these pranksters are going to be bagholders."
600$ by Monday
"PLEASE LIKE THIS TO GET IT TO TRENDINGTHE AMC GAME PLANI know this will sound ridiculous/ too good to be true but here is the plan:First things first we NEED AMC to close above $9 tomorrow otherwise there will be no short squeezeIf we close above $9, it's a one way ticket to tendy townClosing above $9 means all shorts have to cover their positions Friday AH/ Monday, which means they have to buy at the current ask priceWSBs plan is to have limit orders for $1,000 so the shorts covering have no choice but to buy back their shares at $1,000 each, so this will be our plan aswell. Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone here did.This means that AMCs stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000Bad news: The shorts are massive institutions which much more buying power than all of the retail investorsGood news: Because AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of tomorrow no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.This is not easy but 100% possible to do$AMC $GME $BB #NOK"
"Buy you ticket to mars, 383$ is much cheaper than SpaceX offer"
Where is this squeeze everybody promissed would happen today? Had to edure like 10 heart attacks holding shares yesterday just to make it to Friday. I want some action!
HOLD THE LINE BRAVE SOLDIERS
In all fairness the shorts should be told by the government to cover your shorts over 100 percent in the next week.
DO NOT BUY NOKIA. DO NOT DILUTE. STAY ALL IN ON GAMESTOP and beat these hedge funds!
"Just a kind reminder to my long warriors, all the shorts low life will come out in the weekend and will make fairytale kind of stories about GME, AMC,BB. Please mute them. They know their time is up. So hold your position and buy if it dip any time. It is just the beginning of gamma squeeze. So enjoy the ride to the Mars. GTL and have a nice weekend all."
History in the making!
"Lets get this #$%$ out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.So here's the #$%$ rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their #$%$ power to ensure we trade as much as we #$%$ want. They are...??Fidelity and Vanguard??. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league #$%$ for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip #$%$ gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. ??????USE YOUR ??"
"Wait people I think other investors bought it because they saw it will grow. Also let,s not forget that even between hedge funds is a lot of hate and competition. Do you really think is that all of this movement belongs only to the small people? I think a lot of investment funds and hedge funds got in to this to fry and burn their competitors. It is a too big opportunity for them to miss....On the other side if we do not sell on panic....GME has big chances to become a major company. Imagine how well they will perform having so much cash in their accounts in January at the end of a global pandemic and massive economic crisis. Now the money is the king and everything is very cheap."
Hold and buy we going for the tendies!!!
BUY RIGHT NOW. WHATEVER YOU CAN. WE CAN DO THIS
btw its absolutely 0 coincidence that the price declined with the shut down of RH. what RH did is absolutely awful. taking away peoples freedom to buy and sell. this is why people hate big tech.
Do you guys realize they need to buy everything back tomorrow! This will fly to the moon!
EVERYBODY in the whole world who believes in freedom and not oligarchy should be buying 10 shares and holding right now to declare the sovereignty of the individual working person who was created to serve only God and Noone else.
"I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.WHY AMC IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning. COPY AND PASTE THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH"
The price is high after hours because the hedge funds at buying whatever they can. They pass shares back and forth with ascending price and try to knock out any take-profit orders left on overnight. Don’t use them. Hold on and ride the coaster to the top.
"if this goes to 3000 or 5000, short sellers will be bankrupt. Who will be returning the borrowed shares? and what are the consequences for longs?"
I am not selling for less than 1000
buy & hold brothers
Don't you just love it when people change the rules in the middle of the game?
Hold the line my brothers and sisters. Enjoy the weekend. GME will be on the moon come Monday morning.
"No longer about a company, this is a revolution. Hold and buy the dips, run the hedge funds out of business. Delete Robinhood."
"Regardless what happens here, Robinhood is toast after this debacle............."
"Don’t know much about shorting stocks.. important question, by taking the price today and keeping it low, did that allow the hedge funds to close out their short positions to minimize the potential of another $GME ? If they did there should be less squeeze ??"
20% shares short in CRDF!Only 27 mil Float!Bamn!
The whole world is looking at GMG!!!

"DO NOT SELL, WE ARE APE STRONGDO NOT SELL I REPEAT DO NOT SELL. WE HOLD THE POWER, THEY DON'TTHE SQUEEZE IS COMING. BUCKLE UP AND ENJOY THE RIDE !!!!!"
They gonna learn TODAY!
Should i wait for a drop before buying?
Up up up in AH!
"Remember, sideways is winning"
"Okay listen very carefully, like this so everyone sees it. Over the weekend, shorts, bashers and bots will be out in force with trying convincing arguments as to why you should sell. Some of these guys will come in the form of pretend shareholders acting like they care about you saying that they too themselves are going to sell on Monday. Do not listen to them or pay them any mind. This is the time that will now separate the boys from the men. RH is in trouble, they are losing millions of users over the weekend and guess what those users will be doing next week? Switching to more reputable brokers and buying. This is a global trend now, there's no hiding the fact that the manipulation and corruption is happening on a much larger scale. I hold NAKD and GME CURRENTLY because I like the companies and what they are doing. I'm not intelligent, I get my advice from my 6 year old sister. WSB. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC"
"If u guys think big shorts (for tomorrow deadline only) still wait to recover tomorrow ...... think really hard again! No offence, just don’t want see vulnerable retail investor switch big gain to loss"
"Elon musk dual faceHe oppose Shorting stock but he short his own $TSLA Tesla stock by taking loan against that. in 2019 company got closer to bankruptcy but not because he can't sell tesla stock for funding but because of his loan can cause fire sell of Tesla stock and can wipe out $35B of company in minutes then (If he go for funding to save company it would sure caused that)I bet he come bagging those in establishment to save him ( He would not just lose money but gone in jail for $420 tweet as establishment has to show they care). Establishment come up huge plan to make Tesla stock 30 bagger in no time that no one else even think about. I really think he don't care about being richest man because he know it's all due to extreme criminal activity that we will never know about unless their plan end in disaster.His last tweet about $Bitcoin, Why in world person whose mission to save planet from carbon foot print, take all carbon footprint save (I hardly think EV save much if any but that's my personal opinion so not subject to discuss) from 2 decade of tesla operation and wipeout with one tweet.Bitcoin jump 10%+ on tweet, which mean more mining ring will come to life and consume bigger electricity and forced all Electric company to fire their coal plant even at greater speed (Only oil/coal plant, you can control how much electricity generate based on need, Hydro you can but it could cause risk of overflow and side effect of it) So every dollar biThis dual face must exposed. Anyone think Elon Musk Game Stonk tweet is nothing but part of their big criminal plan must work to exposed. I will sure stop if he put atleast $1B of his infinite wealth though worthless $TSLA stock to help bailout all retail investor here and while his Tesla stock is going to drop eventually I will not touch for respect to stand up. Until he take that action either because he is truely supporting retail investor or because he forced to, I will keep tweeting. Later is only likely if people who blindly following also think he should bail out retail investor for level playing field."
SHORT SELLERS ARE DOWN 25 BILLION. HOLD THE LINE. BUY THE DIPS
"We make a fortune here if we hold fast, and buy the dips. That will keep the pressure on the shorts still holding. That will catapult this stock into the $1000's. Get yourself switched to a brokerage that will allow you to trade what you want, and how you want with your money and keep this going. If we let this fall on Monday and into next week the shorts win. If we hold and buy more, the real payday is just around the corner.This is not financial advice."
WAIT FOR AH HYPE... we would se 300+ once more again... HOLD HOLD
went down to $250 just long enough to sbag up 4 more ;-)
I don’t know what everyone is freaked out about. People are buying this stock for the same reason most people buy stock. Because it is going up. Crew people pay attention to or care about the fundamentals. Unfortunately same is true for selling
Hold and BUY BUY BUY
They use after hours to cover then spend the day scaring everyone so the price goes down
What is the word ‘sell’ I’m seeing? I only know how to buy and hold
winning a bet against sharks is god tier feeling
"$SNDL , THIS STOCK WILL PUMP TO THE MOON !"
What you need is a Share split of 1:10 Shorts will be doubly frucked!Gl!
Time is on the long side. The shorts stressing over weekend. I got years.
What you hold is gold. Let’s get those lambos!
Keep going!!! Bulls doing great!
Storming the stock exchange would be more direct and more effective. You might want to consider that after they take all of your money back.
"Far as I m concerned, all shorts that leeched off our hard earned dollars for years can go broke, hungry, cry a river, pound sand whatever. They do not have my sympathy."
"Congrats, All!"
cant sleep. wont sleep. game stop
Robinhood ceo says you can SELL all you want but cannot buy. Do what you're NOT told to do. That's how you make money.
WE HAVE PAPA ELON ON OUR SIDE GUYS!!! HOLD 
"i have been in the industry for 30 years and have been railing against the wall street cartel for years and was punished by regulators for speaking my mind. I am loving what you all are doing and im cracking up as you guys are basically doing to the cartel what they have been doing for decades . What they did to Overstock was immoral at best if not illegal. That said, some of you need to be careful of your wording when posting because it can get you in trouble for organizing a collusion. Just measure your words carefully before you openly post times, dates, and share amounts... keep up the fight but do it smartly. I have no interest in any of the stocks.. just don't want to see some poor kid from Iowa become a whipping boy for regulators and trust me Yahoo would not hesitate to hand over your info to the SEC if asked"
You guy think that tomorrow will be 400+ ? How? Why??Went down to 120 earlier it could be worst tomorrow..just saying.. I’m still holding mine
Platforms are now allowing GME to be bought again.... BUY BUY BUY!
Last one to hold will be holding the bag.
Monday we feast like kings! Good night to all my fellow common men and women
So brokers won't prohibit a stock being shorted to 140% of its float but they're prohibit kids buying a stock in their Robinhood accts. Ok.
No one said it would be easy.Hold
TODAY IS THE DAY. HOLD AND BUY!!!!!
Diamond   hands
They're playing catch in AH now too. Just like they did last night. No one is selling.
THE BROTHERHOOD IN THIS FORUM IS AMAZING. I LOVE YOU GME BOYS AND GIRLS
Look what's happening out in the street! Gotta revolution! Got to revolution! I will be buying a house in the Hamptons that a hedgie will need to sell.
Did the hedgefunds buy all day today when very few could knowing that when the stock came back online the retail investor would pump it and then they sell first thing in the morning and win on both sides
They closed the wallstreetbets. They restricted trading they pulled everything they have but they can’t stop the millions waiting to buy #gme #amc. We will win watch tomorrow
IM HOLDING
"Amazing, short interest keeps going up"
"If you guys only listen to me on one thing it is now!! This stock could make you 6 figures easy. $PHUN. The COO came out with a youtube video as well as he appeared on Bezinga Power Hour. The video talked about how there are over 550 million shares shorted and there daily average volume is 8 million. Do the math, that means it would take 75 days for the shorts to cover. When I saw these videos I bought 60,000 shares at $1.95. I'm expecting to make $2-$5 million off this stock. This opens at $5 minimum and hits $15 on Monday. I'm not selling until this hits $50 next week. The next $GME $AMC"
"All trading in same pattern, this is so fixed.."
Friday will be epic and Monday EPIC++

"Some fake ""covering"" going on right now with ETF redemptions being used to look like cash sells against short covering. The jig is up guys. Go to the board, do this the right way, ask for a follow-on issuance. A lot of longs will support it-- it's the fair and reasonable way to end the squeeze on the same terms for all longs and all shorts. Put cash into an American company and help fund this turnaround play-- and help a lot of US workers and the economy.Take the long view. This issuance is going to create thousands of middle-class jobs that are going to produce income that will eventually wind up back on Wall Street where you can make more money.If you're really smart, turn your cover into a long position. You know this is a terrific momentum turnaround stock at this point."

"Well said Arhum1 minute agoRepost from Mr wolf, very important message : “Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying. Short positions have went up here drastically which means they are banking on a crash but if you as an individual investor, hold together with many other like minded investors.. we can not lose. Keep fighting the good fight. Cheers. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC and many more”"

They can artificially change the price to convince you that everyone is selling, so that you will close your position out of fear. IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THEY HAVE TO BUY YOUR SHARE at a certain point. The price could go down to 60, and what do we do? WE HOLD STRONG. They are done for, please don't let big drops scare you. IF YOU CARE ABOUT MONEY, DO NOT SELL UNTIL 1500"
if they do not have shares they can't short the stock. hold on to your shares the stock will go up let beat the hell of of these hedge funds that short many stock and make small investors lost their money for years now

This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, in reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all."

The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK5,000+"
"Shorts positions do not expire.Don't sell on Friday.The longer you hold, the less shares available, increasing the price and making it unavailable to these shorters to buy back at lower price.Equals, the longer it takes for shorters to buy back at lower price, equals higher interest charged to them---and higher interest means decreasing profits; so, they got no choice but to buy back shares at a much higher price. But if no one is selling, they have to set their buy order at even higher prices. If no one is still selling, then they even have to set buy orders at higher price. So just hold."

Wall Street big banks have trading arms that book $10 billion in profits quarterly. Those big trading rackets have a losing quarter once every 5 years.

"Market Makers will be OK: There are 91,000 Open Call positions from 29Jan expiry that are below $325. In the worst case, the sellers will have to have 91Kx100 = 9.1M shares of GME in their possession. If they have to buy all of them that is 9.1M x 325/sh = $3.0 B. This is whole lot smaller than on Wednesday - when the liability peaked at $60.0 B. In practice they may already have some shares and can actually just settle the difference without needing to buy that many shares. Market makers take the loss and move on. Short positions may be a different story. There is not much visibility for public on up to the minute Short Interest. But today's steady trading indicates a memo went out to short sellers:Dear Short Seller,1. People are asking questions. Demanding inquiries.2. Don't try to be a hero or try to squash the uprising. You are clearly not winning. 3. Close your shorts in $300 range. Don't re-short. Take the loss. Go home.

I invest 1500 today. I dont care if I lose it. I wanted to join this movement. and the potential to gain seems to far outweigh the losses. if you can live without 1.5k I suggest it being worth the tisk

There much better companies we could short squeeze after this one. Such as great biotech companies that literally save lives and are on the verge of bankruptcy due to high cost of R&D and lack of financial resources. If you want to give the short seller a lesson at least do it through biotech companies who save lives and add some moral to the story too Short selling a clothing brand does not hurt people but short selling biotech companies is so disgusting. Give short sellers of biotech companies a good lesson and send messages on WallStreetBet and ask them to choose biotech companies after this one. $AMC $GME $NOK$BNGO $SENS $NVIV $TTOO
If they really closed there position then why are the bots here trying to influence us to sell so we won't be bag holders??
"Alot of people here don't understand; This isn't about the value of the company, or FOMO buying, short sellers are trapped like rats in a barrel here because they have shorted more shares than exist to cover with, and now the price has risen dramatically. The shorts will eventually be forced to buy tons of the stock at whatever the price is. Thats when the buyers will sell shares back to the shorts at a huge premium. This could go to $1k+ a share by then and quick, if traders just keep buying more and holding. It only works if they hold and restrict the shares available to cover with. But don't take any financial advise from me, Im not very smart. I just like the stock. Think I might buy a little soon, after the next dip."

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.
"Per reports it appears some large hedge funds (e.g. Citadel?) were tipped off by Robinhood prior to them putting the ""no buying"" on GME and other stocks today, and therefore, the hedgies shorted these stocks again on top of their current shorts.

"They need to investigate and report the truth. Who was pulling the strings on multiple brokers to ban clients from buying $GME and causing panic selling as well as margin liquidations. A drop of 371 points, 77% on only 8 million shares traded with multiple trading halts. Also look what happened to the options during that time.Also look into stocks like$KOSS$AMC$CYDY$FUBO"
"IMPORTANT!Everybody should know this:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-01-28/billionaire-peterffy-worried-about-integrity-of-markets-video@0:40 it explains of how much money we are talking about, when options expire and If the shortseller and option seller can't pay, the broker has to pay.Now let's see what was the closest ASK price before they halted the whole marked and shutdown some brokers like robinhood: (There are more screenshots ranging between 900 and 5000$)http://alphabetaorchards.com/wsb/weird%20ask.jpgWhen they realised nobody is selling under 5000$ they halted the marked, shutdown robinhood and used short ladder tactics to simulate a sell off! Eventually some of you got scared and really sold them cheap shares. The reason many brokers stopped trading #GME isnt the garbage they tell you in the TV News.Melvin Capital, Citadel and the brokers couldnt afford this huge losses they would have made if they bought those super expensive shares. Thats why they halted, simulated a sell off and restricted buyers. Btw those companies have a connection...What this means:We had such strong diamond Hands the share price would have exploded and they couldn't afford it, so they did what they did (illegal).Now maybe think about adjusting your sell limit ALOT higher. Because of the option expiredate on friday and still 100% outstanding short interest. There will be a buyer for every seller. So dont panic if they manipulate the stocks and sell at a price they deserve!No financial advise. Just my opinion. Do the research yourself!*rocketsigns x 100*"

We must stand strong and hold the line. There will be as thorough an investigation into the Robinhood and hedge funds, shutting down buying of stocks that were running, that they didn't want to run, as there was into all the Biden family corruption pre election, and similar investigation as they did with voter fraud, and similar to the riots and damage that was done to our cities for months, and if there is they will receive a punishment like Kevin Clinesmith.

"This is the new $GME! In today’s trading, retail investors decide to invest based on brands and no brand is more recognized by retail traders than Playboy. If we get that traction, it can reach +$100. To be clear I don’t believe it is worth that much, but it’s supply and demand."

"To the people who are scared of missing the GME 'squeeze', you will know when it happens. (AKA GME ENDGAME)DiscussionA lot of comments that I read, people are scared that they will 'miss' the GME squeeze. Let me tell you about the Volkswagen Squeeze that happened in 2008. On 28th Oct 2008, Volkswagen stock opened at 500 Euros. The stock hit an ATH of 1005 Euros during the day and closed at 945 Euros. This means that you will certainly know when the squeeze begins.Now the question is how high can the squeeze go? That, no one here knows for sure because the times have changed and it can easily reach maybe 2k$ or 5k$? Who knows? You can sell the stock at the squeeze (When the price massively goes up) at the price you are comfortable with when the squeeze happens. Do not worry, the squeeze will not last for like 5 or 10 seconds as we saw with the example from Volkswagen above (Which lasted a whole day).Also, many people are thinking to sell on Friday or Monday? Do not sell unless there is a squeeze or do not lose hope if the stock does not moon ? on Monday opening. It will come and it will be beautiful. Alas, if u/Deep#$%$ingValue held the stock for months and is waiting for the squeeze, then who are we paper handed ?? people to sell early ? Diamond hands only ??. Cheers!Information on the Volkswagen article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927538X16300075P.S: This is not financial advice, I am holding GME because I like GameStop and I like Games!"
Hold strong . We’re headed for the squeeze ending today or starting next week on Monday premarket. $1000 share price is no longer a meme it’s a low estimate of a stock price that could move upwards of $5000.

"All longs should note that $GME events on recent days may change the game in INO. INO short interest drop to 27.6% as of this Friday although it is still big. If all longs or potential longs keep acquiring shares while holding their existing shares without selling. All shorts will eventually be squeezed. $GME tells us that those ""big (bad) guys"" may not be able to control everything. Somehow individuals can fight back. So true longs of INO should be confident and firmly keep their shares and gain what they deserve in future. We all know Inovio has huge growth potential. As many think it could be a biotech Tesla. So all longs should stand together to protect our shares and wait for the big time coming. GLTA."

"Out of curiosity, what’s preventing us from doing this again with a little more of a collaborative effort and a strategic initiative behind it that has a little more validity than WSB? This would hopefully lead to less of a chaotic exit when the collective message is “buy and hold” no matter what. Obviously not as formal of a strategic initiative that would break SEC rules (not that it seems to matter). We’ve experienced very positive results when we rally behind each other for a greater cause."

I’ve called my international friends- hey listen just buy 1 or 2 shares to show your support...this is being bought all over the world. 1 or 2 shares isn’t going to set any one person back.
Just keep in mind this is all a game of musical chairs. Watch out when the music stops. However I personally believe it is going higher next week.
This is scary... but in a good wAy

Oh but wait ..we're saving the world I forgot. • The man doesn't have a clue how to deal with China ...after all, that's over half his income stream. • Appoints Fauci where he's making 500,000 salary and pushing worthless vaccines that he's got ownership in...humm. • Oh and let's all 'double' mask up ...because that's just common sense.Unreal”"
Who ever heard of a trade app allowing only one share purchases of certain stocks. Keep trying to stop us. GME would be way higher if not for the sudden new rules. We are going to keep chipping. Pretty sure a sht storm of law suits coming.

"For the ones asking why AMC is decreasing, take a look at all WSB owned stocks. $GME, $BB, $NOK $AMC. they are all down about 20%. What does this tell you? I don't think this is a coincidence. What I believe is that the Hedge Funds are trying to scare us off by slightly decreasing the price during the after market / pre market so that the paper hands get scared and let go off the stock the moment the trading for us start. I think that this is a coordinated attack and we should hold and buy more. Also compare the volume we have during the day trading and compare it to after and pre market volumes. This is all just manipulation from the hedge funds to scare us. But we need to keep on going. They don't hold the power, we actually do. They are scared so they are trying to scare us by faking how strong they are, but in fact we are stronger. If you compare this to the human realm, when a person is scared they try to scare the perp by acting stronger, hoping that the perp will run or stop doing what they are trying, but if the perp is smart he will see through this and dominate them even harder.Upvote this so all smooth brains can see this.WE WILL WIN.HOLD AND BUY."
Good thing I saw this turnaround story stock and bought in.
"Who cares about making money, this is about Wall street LOSING MONEY!!! PEDAL TO THE METAL"
its not about profits remember

With all of these stocks that are being manipulated gave everyone a chance to cash out with big profits. In the end the stocks are back close to where they started a few days ago. So what was the point. Who lost and who won in the end
Remember when the market opens your shares are good and hold until they burst wall street green !!!!
aint selling. waiting for the squeeze
Don’t let the market manipulation make u believe it’s over. It’s just beginning. HOLD THE LINE
If you sale your stock today you might as well be there for the hedge party they will need week hands to pour there champagne
what's a good place to buy and sell stocks that hasn't blocked GME?
Right now we are selling to each others and shorts are not coughing up any money to cover their positions. Rumors are $GME like $AMC and earlier $TSLA is coming up with a series of new issues to rescue hedge funds. The new issue will be priced starting $100 and going down to $20. If that happens we will all loose except those who exit fast.
"What brokerages did not halted /restricted trading GME, NOK, AAL etcI have ( soon had ) accounts at Fidelity, TDA, Etrade, RoobinBad ALL of which I intend to close.Any recommendations?g17w17"
I wonder how much wall street paid Robinhood for stopping trades on GME BB and AMC.
so RobinHood effing over it's customers. great service.
Guys every single dip is csuse by mass selloff. Is not WSB Selling. If we would we wouldn’t make a blip in the share price. Shorts trying to tank the price and nothing else. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They double down trying to scare us into selling
GME reaching 1k means more to me now more than ever after yesterday's fiasco. Tron coin founder bought $1m of GME from Asia and standing with WSB.

"If this gets to the closing bell trading above $300, today's afterhours squeeze (and premarket Monday) could be epic. (In that case the trading high might arrive from 9:20AM-9:35AM on Monday)But people should be aware that if GameStop announces something like a secondary offering of shares in order to capitalize on their inflated stock price, the stock could implode in a way that is rarely seen. GME stock is a high wire act and holding it with anything but the tightest intraday stops is mighty risky. Based strictly on fundamentals the company might be fairly valued at closer to a tenth of this level."
it dropped to less that 200 yesterday at this same exact time frame...then rallied back up over 100$.

Remember... BUY and HOLDDO NOT SELL
I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow but I'm holding just for the intrigue. It wouldn't surprise me if the hedge funds and the clearinghouse's break the law to stop the bleeding and look to their lawyers to win in court when they get sued. Just because shorties cover doesn't mean we will get paid. This is going to get ugly. We never seen anything like this. Good luck.
Everyone should go to SEC site and demand they make changes to shorting rules:1) Put the Up Tic rule back in immediatly 2) Only allow a shorter shorting a stock at one brokerage not several. This way it's easy to see how many shares they've shorted..3) Publish who holds a short position in the stock and how many shares over 5% just like they do for funds or major holders of the stock.
too late to get in?
This 'thing' is in consolidation mode. It can easily move 100% above its current value.

"$GME conversation***COPY AND PASTE THIS IN FORUMS****. From r/wallstreetbets user u/DNXPeeJay:MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC $NOK $BB $GME $NAKD It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, in reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.Less"

It is non- ethical and never ending game.Also , it looks like institutions behind the shorts are trying to turn Robinhood into the scapegoat and avoid future legal persecution. In the meantime it looks like they put their short position on again knowing that RH will halt the buying. What a non-ethical ( not sure if it is legal or marginaly legal) way!SHORTENING OF THE STOCKS NEEDS TO BE STOPPED !!"
Bought a few more shares my full order wasn’t complete. Only filling at about 5 shares at a time.

"Literally no volume and it’s up like this, most platforms have lifted the restrictions on purchasing, we are going to $1000 today boys"
"From Robinhood “ We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.”. It’s Sorrento’s turn !!!"
"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We are only in second inning (second week), battle is on! Shorts better cover before Robinhood & ETrade forced to lift the trading ban!!!"
C'mon guys ! There's a float to squeeeeeze !!

Warren defending the little guys vs Robinhood ban... Wow
The CEO literally said nothing  NO ANSWERS!!
I’ve never shorted a stock but I believe they have until the end of the day tomorrow to close their shorts.I think they want to drive the price high in order to entice people to sell and drop the price so they can cover.Thoughts?

I LOVE YOU HODL!!!! TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!!!!

the bulk of the individuals that are long will panick at opening when the stock goes downhill fast. this will be a bloodbath for the majority of the vegas gamblers here and just a handful will be going to the beach for the rest of their lives.
WE WILL CLOSE 400+
some smart broker is going to let the retail guys buy GME and all the other brokers who are blocking GME buys are going to lose all their business to that smart broker
Robinhood is liquidating its credit line from banks. They must be in trouble and they deserve it. I will short their stock the first day they go IPO.
"https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1355265967463542785/photo/1Short Interest still very high. They havent covered yet. This stock will go up till the Short interest of float is at around 50%Every day holding this short position costs a lot of borrowing fee. They have to cover soon. Untill then hold it!! And dont get scared from short attacks, it just increases the short interest...Wait for the squeeze...you will see when it happens!"
We need to push hard in the last hour and into AH. We are making a statement. HOLD!!!!
I am a stockholder of this company now. I think the price will go up a lot given the short squeeze. But what games do they produce? Just trying to do some DD here.
Tomorrow is the day. Get ready for the war!!!!
$gme and $amc have received so much celebrity and political support. This is only going to go up!
320 common
Still in and buying more.
Can you buy on Interactive brokers today?
Nobody is selling
"WE DONT BEND, WE DONT FOLD, WE DONT BREAK. Diamond hands."
Buy. Buy.
Got one share at 312.99 ---Fight the good fight everyone!
Let’s teach them a lesson to put in the history books !!!
"You can’t sell when you’re at war. This is more than a stock now. The hedge funds will pay, this is for ‘08. ’s forever"
"I'm hearing chatter that some platforms are closing peoples positions on $GME to protect them, while not allowing the stock to be purchased, and while Citadel who owns Melvin Capital reloaded there SHORT position before all the platforms stopped buying.This is long term prison for these guys... If not, the system is even more corrupt then we can imagine. And we should all know it's already a disgrace to AMERICA these people in power. Most of them..."
Got another 50 shares
So the big guys win thanks to the help of Robinhood and Interactive Brokers stopping the little guy from buying this stock to drive it up along with AMC. There will be a story about how the hedge funds did this and it won't be pretty.
were doing it keep it up. proud of all of you for holding
Wonder if these kids trading know you cannot buy and sell the same stock 5 times a day ??
Tomorrow will be awesome. PERIOD. Awesome. Finally after 30+ years trading something inspirational. Lets do this. Drive it to the moon!!! IS it really 226% short? Good god.
GameStop. Won't stop.
HOLDING STRONG. CANADA REPORTING FOR DURY
"What's happening IMO, is shorts of $GME are selling off the rest of the market to get liquid, I believe some shorts might be holding out here lower 300s, right now we're in a bit of a stalemate, and guess what long money is interest free, short money is not. Shorts are losing by waiting all things equal. Still upside pressure. Not advice but my thoughts."
"168% float..... lets gamma queeze for the 4th time today... shots have been fired, blood is in the water. time for them to feel the mini mikes"
Webull Opened trading for all stocks guys .. $AMC $GME and all ... Go Install and buy
"Much like $OZSC which Tim Sykes has heavily targeted with shorts, he is also heavily shorting $AITX an artificial intelligence company. Don't forget to set your sell order limit high. I have it at 10.00 for $OZSC and 5.00 for $AITX. Can we make these shorts stop picking on undervalued stocks? $GME says we can."
"Lowww volume, more manipulation. DONT LET IT GET TO YOU WE ARE STRONG. #HOLD"
"Shorts Sad, Shorts Broken.The world is long, the Chad's have spoken!"
This doesn’t make sense. How can a stock fall so rapidly and be up in the after market trading. These guys were toying with us. Everyone keeps on buying and this thing will be soaring tomorrow
"this is exactly the way you operate a casino...if the clients win too much, break some bones and ban them from the building"
$600 tmrw let’s go boys
I am holding strong

They call themselves Robinhood? I don't think it means what they think it means.
"According to JEN WIECZNER Posted on January 29, 2021 4:51 PM ESTAn analysis of short stock positions by S3 Partners shows that short-sellers aren't done betting against GameStop—and many are just getting started."
I got one share this morning for $305... YOLO!
its not over till next week.. we must hold till they have to cover
The fact that it's still over $200 with all these trade halts and brokerage restrictions tells us that this isn't the top.
"If anything sell a covered call buy a put or short against the box..u can not lose.......I am hot shot stock jock...btw look at gern,stick it to adam feurnstein"
Show some love to Tesla who did the great tweet and helped out stock out. Don’t let Tesla fall like the rest of the stock market
THUMBS UP IF YOU ARE HOLDING FROM CANADA!
 thanks for the cheaper entry price!
We need a strong finish to force shorts margin calls.
"Will buy one just to be on the right side of this game, gl to all"
Hedge funds will never cover at these prices. Bankruptcy is far cheaper option.
CONGRATS!! GME is almost to 340!! Exactly where it was before it tanked yesterday! This short squeeze is amazing!!! Power to the movement!!! LMAO :)
"Why don’t you kids just go and play with your beloved cryptocurrencies and leave the good old hedge finds to us, boomers? Personally I never though they make any harm to my investments, on the contrary, the help find a good entry point, at least for smart investors. You are only making everything worse. Remember that the stock crush of 1929 started with an orchestrated short squeeze. It ended badly for absolutely everyone. Nobody won."
"Is it possible to just buy shares and cancel them? Or donate them to the Salvation Army (pursuant to a 3-year lockup agreement)? I am sick and tired of having people running around knocking on my door every 30 seconds convincing me to sell.This forum is for GME owners, not for seedy business brokers to try and convince people to sell before the value of their business goes down."
HOLD HOLD HOLD!! TOGETHER EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE... SUPPORT EACH OTHER NOW!!GREETINGS YOUR FRIEND FROM SWITZERLAND!!!!
even after hours they cant get teh rpice down...this is so funny to watch
"Well the truth is finally coming to ligh... Robinhood stopped allowing people to pile into amc and gme, not because it was just concerned about it's retail investor customers... IT it did this to protect itself... It's liquidity has run dry...not good for a company trying to ipo in 3 weeks... And that's how the hedge funds are going to hit back... Make robinhood's liquidity dry up, so they can't loan out more money, and then all the people on margin that are negative can't add to their position to make up for the difference... The buy demand falls, and so does the price...Just look what happened to the price briefly when robinhood suspended buying the stock...it fell to $150/share....Robinhood's liquidity is the issue. And that's not good for the folks on margin that are going to get a margin call ...https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?srnd=premium"

That’s why they don’t like people make money And today in robinhood didn’t let people to buy this stock

"They can't be halting trading and buying. What do they think this is, an election?"

Buying
Lets go wsb!
The drops today on less than half normal volume!! Its institution and fund selling shares to scare us into selling!!! We will HOLD until we are all rich
Just shorts trading with each other on super low volume while brokers block buying. Meaningless. They still need to cover millions and millions of shares.
HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!
$NOK INSANE BOUNCE! SO IS $GME $AMCLETS GO! TOMORROW WE FIGHT!BUY DIP TO MOON
"To all HOLDERS! $5000 per share is way too cheap! $10,000 is a realistic minimum!!!"
Shorts should be banned or heavily regulated. All this insanity is possible because of heavy shorting. Wall street has been gambling for free for too long.
"Bought shares just to contribute to this Movement. Willing to risk it all to level the playing field with the little people, like me."
"#GMEUPDATEThis is being shared. **SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING** HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHAREIn the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a **short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares.** Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.How it works:Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS **HOLD HOLD HOLD!** DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!"
Shorts have to realize that it is not about making money anymore with GME.... its about making a point!!!!
"Game on, nuke the shorts! They sold more than they could cover..."
HERE WE GOOOOOOO! Next stop $400.
Just bought 5 more shares. Total of 53
HOLD GUYS AND GIRLS! The volume is absolute miniscule. It tells us that these are the big hedge funds shorting again. NO PAPER HANDS ARE SELLING
GME trade preventing is illegal!!!!

This is all I have to say... The comeback is greater than the setback! $GME $AMC $BB $EXPR $KOSS
Good job boys it’s Green !
HOLDING!
Here comes the party!! $GME $NAKD $AMC
What I admired the past several sessions is the overall feel of work together- and not in a socialistic way - in a “care about the guy next door” way.To regress means......... not what you guys meant.Was the message intended to f with the establishment ——— or was it to find common sense?
MORE NEWS = MORE BUYS = MORE HOLDS = MORE SQUEEZE ! $AMC $NOK $GME
VYGR is a sleeping GIANT!!! $$$$
What's everyone doing? Tap me in to the hot buzz? What do the people say? I am ready to do whatever everyone is doing.
even if those with diamond hands cashed out.. at this point this stock has so much momentum new buyers will take it up. paired with the fact short interest still hovering around 100%.... we might be late hands but no paper hands here 
GONNA REACH THE MOON $NAKD $NOK $AMC $GME
hold the line 
1.25 X the float. Up we go!
I love this stock!!I will not sell today!!Diamond Hands!!!!!
Hey I bought some GME this morning for $400 will I make money?
Most people here either have put or call options. Many have 1-5 gme stock holding. Nobody who is smart enough to have made hundreds of thousands trading will act like this unless they are manipulating newbies to buy so they can hit their call price.
$500 Monday open
"Hold and wait, this only cost us some time. It can take a week or two. But they have to pop."
Stocks can realistically go up forever; today was a sad day for society. Robinhood is not what they claim to be. Institutions and exchanges are the sewer-back-up of the earth—never forget that!
volume levels at 11m but price is being suppressed? hmmmm... manipulation at work again
Still trying to understand why management hasn’t issued new shares. IT IS THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL FIX THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE
"Guys, lots of money has been made by manipulation and well done to all who made. However the company is not worth the share price and as soon as everyone starts to take profits the price will drop massively. It will bounce around but making money here is a limited play so be careful and don’t get left holding the bag!"
Robinhood uses Dominion market making machines
"lol boomers PLEASE short this, lets test your resolve."
Every time I feel down I come here to read some comments and my day is better. HOLD!!
"Earlier in the day, Robinhood banned the buying of $GME, $AMC, $BB and $NOK (GameStop, AMC Theaters, Blackberry and Nokia) stocks, after small-time traders snapped them up, inflated their value, and got rich while inflicting devastating losses on Wall Street hedge funds, who had gambled a fortune on these companies’ decline."
Your buying empty company . The beauty here was that retail group seen the flaw hedges done by shorting 140% of a company . Worthless or not if people start buying shares the stock going to fly and I bet there was some hedge funds that weren't short went long . this just added fuel to the fire they probably loaned their profits to hedges that were short at a high interest rate . No doubt wealth has changed hands . My advice is if your a retail individual take your profit / gift buy BAC or MSFT put in your retirement fund . Live to play another day .
THIS WILL SKY ROCKET TMRW
"This is amazing and soon everyone will be millionaires, but, you can't buy your yacht with shares. you better know when to sell, or you will be left holding a $20 stock in a company on the verge of bankruptcy. I applaud light being shed to a rigged system. like a powerball ticket, some will be rich, though most will have nothing"
Im holding and buying more!!!
"Today is when the fuse is lit and the rocket takes off when it finishes with all Calls ITM and all Puts OTM. They will have to react on Monday and the squeeze will begin in earnest. There are bound to be a lot of ups and downs today. They will try to shake those shares away from you. They will try to catch your stop loss. They will try to draw your focus to other stocks. They will spread doubt. You got this though. We got this.For those that bought at 480. We are coming to get you today.For those that had paper hands yesterday, you can have diamond hands today.We will need those diamond hands and brass balls today."
"50,000 a share? What do?"
Why can't everyone just get along and make this go to 5000 lol

Maybe now gamestop can come up with their own video games and it'll be our new video game company.
"We had a $370 swing from peak to bottom with 1/3 of the typical daily volume. Why was there so little volume? Because we are not selling . They used a ladder attack scheme using microshares traded back and forth rapidly at lower and lower prices to artificially push the stock down hoping some weak hands would see a 70% drop and panic sell so they can cover their massive short position for cheaper. We didn't sell, in fact many of us scooped up even more shares for cheap. Without a doubt they will be trying this tactic again tomorrow before 230,000 in the money contracts expire and get exercised. BUY AND HOLD UNTIL THEY ARE ON THEIR KNEES CALLING YOU PAPI  Just how I see it, not financial advice, I just really like this stock."
Look at this NO FXXKING VOLUME and it goes down.100% MANIPULATION
we are back on Robinhood
"I thought hedge (sic) funds were suppose to hedge a little via a combination of short positions, stock, and options?"
The squeeze ain’t squozenhttps://isthesqueezesquoze.com/
Robbinhood is synonymous with market manipulation. Preventing you from buying any stock you wish to buy is the same as stealing. They need to be prosecuted and sent to prison for theft. They've stolen profits you would have made buying GME to protect the thieves they're in bed with. Cancel your accounts and find a new platform that puts their clients first. Cancel and move your accounts and send an arrow through Robbinhoods heart.
Holding till Monday then!
Guys you can count on me! I'm not selling no matter what
Well done all holders. AH is volatile we know that. Have a good weekend and come back strong again on Monday.
i love how they can't talk about what actually happened bc the infinity loop that hedge funds caused themselves would completely break the game if everyone knew about it. donate. help your friends. pay loans. make america great again...the right way.
"I think To the young guns, it’s not only about money at this point! It’s about dignity!"
Come on shorts
"Heck, if I were GME I'd be putting out a secondary offering to make a bunch of money/capital right now."
LETS PUSH FOR $500 AH
Up up up
It'll jump back over 350.00 after hours. Monday it'll go over 400.00 a share guaranteed.
I dont know how many times over the last 3 years people have tried to convince me that naakked shorting didnt exist? LOL guess they were wrong.

Look at the shorts covering in secret.

Did they lift restrictions or are we waiting to hear still? Ty
"Hold till next week. Set your sell limits for $5000 plus, this will be a gamma squeeze next week."
"The obvious question here is that at some time in the future hopefully your eventual goal of driving out the hedge funds in this stock and others that you have converged on. By holding a stock that obviously is not worth anywhere of what it is now, you have essentially forced everyone in your group to hold pat or risk starting a stampede to the doors and the price collapsing and everyone losing a lot of money, mainly those who supported the cause but after it started to climb exponentially. While I love what your goals with this are, I have to ask someone for an honest answer, what is the exit strategy after you achieve your ultimate goal? How do your members assuming it is mostly your members who have created this gross bubble get out of this whole? We see stories about some of your members who obviously bailed with a tidy profit early on paying off their student loans, which is very admirable yet counter to the cause and therefore your ultimate goal. So how do the rest of your members exit and you all remain whole? Serious question."
if it closes over $335 probably be a $500 spike up monday morning
Green is GREEN
Security Commission should investigate all the brokers that not allowed investors to trade GME.
"Copied from WSB Reddit:I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall. Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and #$%$ retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants#$%$ fear.Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6oIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today."

(Copied and pasted)The limit imposed by Robinhood and others on how many shares you can purchase (vs unlimited selling) will make things very hard for us. There is no guarantee that squeeze will happen today. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. Hedge funds are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation that Today is make-or-break for $GME so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DO NOT FALL FOR IT BECAUSE SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. It may be Friday or could be next week but for sure one day we will see the real squeeze. Until that time comes hold the #$%$ line.REMEMBER ENEMY IS NOT FIGHTING BACK BECAUSE WE ARE WEAK, BUT BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG. THEY KNOW THEY ARE LOSING THE BATTLE! AND NOW THEY FEAR US.

Robinhood to allow retail traders to buy GME tommorow
Their was no halting of selling when GameStop was deteriorating to single digits and retailers were losing money while the shorts gained but now that GameStop rose rapidly and the shorts lost the brokers halt buying sounds legit
"I'm thinking of the broader reaches of this rally. Yesterday we forced the hedge funds to liquidate long positions in other stocks to cover their shorts here, this sent those stocks down and caused a sell off. The market went down. With today's deliberate blocking of buying they were able to drive the price down and profit, rebuying long positions in FANG stocks and more causing a market rally.Hypothetically speaking, if this is allowed to rise (without further blocks), the covering of the short calls could trigger an entire market crash...."

Volume is low because we are holding!. All they do is fake manipulating a sell off. STAY STRONG LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
I love the stock market! It’s easy money!
I get the feeling that Wall St is selling off other stocks to raise the money to go to war with us over AMC and $GME  Does anyone else get that feeling? I think they are exiting positions right now to enter into positions against us on AMC and GME

Two choices only here for Wall Street, and neither is a good one for them, either way this GME situation is going to be the ""beginning of massive change on Wall Street, watch and see."
That was your dip. You missed it. Now up up up!
GUYS EVERY SINGLE DIP IS CAUSED BY A MASSIVE SELLOFF.ITS NOT WSB SELLING. EVEN IF IT WERE IT WOULDNT MAKE A BLIP IN THE SHARE PRICE.These dips are caused by shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. AGAIN. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling. Every share they sell is BORROWED. It has to be repaid. THEY will need to buy it back and repay it.Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.THIS IS A REPOST.
Keep those  STRONG!HOLD THE LINE! 
$GERN - a cancer drug stock in FDA stage 3 trials shows up with vey sizable short position by??? with increasing BlackRock holdings of 25M shares . I’m in it before a possible squeeze Do your own DD. and GERN is not on the RH list limiting purchases of shares. GLTA

Hold we up nicely in aftermarket. Don't get scared. This was a tactic to pick up cheaper shares to cover. They are making money too. The only one that looses is the little guy. Hold. I can't believe they stooped so low. What is amazing is it uncovered all the manipulation they have been benefiting from for years. Bravo little guys/gals.
No reason to do business with Robinhood ever again.

"PEOPLE...... PLEASE LISTEN.... there is no ceiling for them, its not likegoing long where you can only lose what you put in..... if they cant cover they could lose it ALL!!!!! I mean all of it. We can take back it all in one swoop. You are slwsys crying about a better life. How its unfair. Here is your chance to change it all. All you have to fo is simply buy and hold."
"Why are there people in here talking about the fundamentals of the stock. We know this stock isn't worth 300+ everyone knows. The value in the stock is the ability to crowd source a short squeeze on a hedgefund caught with their pants down. The short interest is still over 100%, when they are squeezed they have to cover that 100% and then cover again the % over 100. The value of this stock going to the moon is making a hedgefund pay out an exponential gain."
You might be wondering who is buying if platforms banned it. Well whole the world is buying including Asia and Europe
GameStop will be well over 600 tommorrow. HOLD do not sell. Be patient. You will be rewarded!
I think we just have to move some cash to other low stocks like $MRO (all time high 50 bucks and now $7) we can pump this easly and get some dividends.

"Awesome...but everyone does know not every short expires today, right?"
"Hearings coming! OK! DEMAND criminal charges and jail sentences for the billions in theft due to a criminal conspiracy!Police investigation! Supoena emails and phone records from all short hedge funds, particulary Citadel Grifin and Melvin and point 72,all brokers who had an outage and deplatformed GME and other stocks!"
"Robinhood prohibits fractional shares to be purchased. I don't know for other platforms, Alpaca can still buy and sell GME. Just tried transfering a few hundreds thousands to Robinhood to see if I can buy whole lot (100 shares) of GME."
According to statics Short holder have to sell their position on the last day of the month which is today at the last hour of the day. IT is all about holding position during the trading day .
On Twitter earlier.“Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management. Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to people taking back the free market. Citadel owns the app Robinhood. Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH. Market manipulation.”
So brokers have to buy at any PRICE! $1000 or more! Hold long! Run it UP! 
good things happen to good people

SET MY LIMIT SELL AT 1K. LETS GO $AMC $GME $BB
I am for retail traders........be careful this could easily be a trap. The two hedge firms who were short already covered! When the price dropped to $120 who is to say that these hedge funds weren't responsible for the purchase of that dip which was millions of shares. The buying drove up the price and it was back up $70 in minutes. This could be Revenge of the Big Boys ....just remember they didn't get this far playing fair!!!! These are professional traders and they get off on this kind of stuff. This is all to crazy and I don't see it playing out in our favor. We retail traders make up less then 5% of the daily volume . Repeat that! I have only 10 shares of GME so I can't speak for everyone but don't get fooled. Just looking out! Citron = Greed ........don't fall victim to a planned attack.
OmG I can finally buy more at a huge discount hahahaha
"If you support the little guy standing up to the institutions, buy and hold!"

People always say float a stock deal to pay off debt when your stock goes up. In the GME case I would buy a great growth company. The stock would skyrocket short squeeze even further. Plus EA would skyrocket also.

"SUMMARY of what you need to know:- Citadel might have just added shorts position on GME- The short percentage is still high at 122% (down from 140%), but not much is being squeezed out yet- After WSB's meeting on Discord, they will continue buying at least until next Wednesday, NOT this Friday- Gamma squeeze has not happened yet, WSB is aiming at 5000- After the pressure from the public, brokers are forced to allow retail investors to buy, a bigger squeeze will be happening"
Hold and buy more $AMC and $GME. We go to the moon.  I am buying and keep holding from Canada.

"It would be absolutely unconscionable fir the SEC or the govt to take the side of the short hedgefunds against retail invröestors, because that would betray once and for all who they really represent.The Big Shorts have been getting away with ""short and bash"" or "" short and distort"" for decades with impunity, at the expense of the small shareholders. I would love to testify to the flaw in regulation 17CFR 240 15c3-3(a)5 which has given a 140% advantage to shorts over longs since 1934."
Hold all day today?
You guys are fighting a no win war. You have won the first battle but GameStop is just going to print as many shares as it wants and bring the price back down and pocket your money. SILVER is the only war we can win over the long term. The banks can’t print SILVER.

Hold and do not sell, they are running out of time and money paying out massive interest to keep their positions open. Blackrock was probably a lifeline for liquidity but that's drying up and soon they will have no way out, this is where we name our price. 1K is a low estimate, 2-3K is possible.

"Dear Hedge Fund managers who specialize in shorting stocks:When you put out press releases talking bad about a stock, knowing that you will make money when it falls, don’t try to change the rules when others join together to bankrupt you. Just learn your lesson.True capitalism is a beautiful thing."
Just keep buying! Tomorrow the puts hit!!! This will fly!! This is what we planned for! $AMC $GME
bought a share!
"If Robinhood is force selling shares , are they paying the tax liability on the stock ?"
Wont stop can’t stop GameStop
"APES STRONG TOGETHER, HOLD THE LINE WE WILL SQUEEZE THE SHORTS"
Stick to the plan!!! $GME $AMC. We don’t need to spread money to 5 other stocks tomorrow. AMC is still cheap if you cannot afford GME.1. Do not use margin! They will sell your shares!2. Buy3. Buy the dips!4. HOLD and DO NOT SELL til 20x!
"With Robinhood opening back up 'limited trading' on GME AMC and others, its going to spike. Plus its end of month for the calls AND its end of week where stock usually is higher. Buckle up butter cup.Don't sell and hold out until $1,000/share"
Warren today: need cops on the beat. Warren 8 months ago: defund the police.
"Lil guys, proud of you all for holding up against the odds."
TBH. Should've seen this squeeze from miles away. $2 a share for GME?
lets go
"Making waves, same shares. Every sold share make the waves bigger. Wait hold buy"
"Wow!AOC just announced that she will get involved in this matter tonight!Hold on folks, we will prevail!"
let's close today at $420
Going to drop 1k to support my fellow man. If we crush the hedge funds and make a profit same time thats a bonus!
what a nice discount
"Thomas Peterffy has got to be jailed for his incriminating statements on GME. Laughing when he says it should be 17, that's a clear signal he manipulated the stock!"
FOR THE MEMES
"GME IS STILL SHORTED WAY ABOVE 100%!The greedy hedgefunds are paying millions in interest each day. They'll have to cover their shorts sooner or later. KEEP HOLDING, MAKE THEM BLEED MONEY!"
In
"So people pooled their money together and invested in the stock market, for a particular objective. Say, to point out hedge fund manipulation. But in doing so, you become the very thing you despise: a hedge fund. Albeit decentralized and unofficial, but it is very similar."
"The market rallied today because the financial sector recuperated some of the loses they had from the $GME, $AMC & $BB squeeze. They were able to make gains because robinhood were limiting trading on these stocks & also in certain cases, were selling stocks without the users consent which is part of the reasons why there’s currently a lawsuit against robinhood.The move from robinhood was made after Sequoia Capital & the White House pressured the founder of Robinhood to take actions against this. Some similar actions were apparently taken on other brokers."
"This company is a joke, and so is the stock price. AMC as well. The new traders have absolutely no idea what it means to take a profit. They choose to gloat and print their brokerage statements on line, just because they made a few bucks. GME is trading at 266 in AH now. Fair value according to any available metrics is about $30-$40. It make take a bit of time, but it will trade down to fair value soon."
ETRADE just blocked my purchase of GME!
today buying 50 shares!!!!!!!
Monday is gonna be lit
#NOK #AMC #GME the three tips of the trident
S3 partner shows gme short interest has not changed - smart money and hedge funds sold good stocks to hedge against next hedge that will go under next week. Gme will go up for sure it held up pretty good and anytime it deeps it comes back up lolAlso WSB keep adding million user a day how do you like that! New money go in Monday - game is not over lol Bohica!
"You have to wonder many millions Vlad Tenev and his team made today when Robinhood restricted trading to only selling in GME, AMC, BB, etc.?? We you can only SELL, what direction doe the stock go??? When sell your information beforehand to hedge funds, how much of a short position do they take on just before the ban on buying? Robinhood and all other broker clients lost billions of dollars today - BILLIONS!!! Talk about market manipulation eh!!!"
There has already been 3.8k in volume on the $650 Calls expiring today. They are about $2.25 per contract right now. Someone is pretty optimistic
very entertaining
"Soooo much media hype, everyone is on our side! We all know its a bubble....but we ride it higher on momentum  diamonds . 110 shares, hold the line!"
Someone explain a YOLO buying calls and stock??
Why isn't the stock price changing after hours?
whats a realistic sell price for this?
I’ll buy some of this stock just because of the pain it causes the professional Wall Street manipulators. I look at it as a donation. I don’t care if it goes to zero. It will squeeze out and damage the big criminals.
can't stop won't stop gamestop
"Alright, fine, I will play: 1/22/21 puts @ $150 strike. Let's see what happens."
The fix is in. The HUGE money on Wall Street colluded with the Exchange Commission. The little guy is always up against it.
HOLD FOR THE GOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
$GNUS is about to take off! Last chance to catch the  
I support the retail buyers here but what is to stop Wall Street from crashing the markets at this point?
"This is like that storm in the Truman Show with bear raiders, retail brokers, bots, and CNBC talking heads all sitting up in the control booth, desperate to keep Truman from escaping.We're getting close. Wall Street and the Hedge Funds need to do the right thing here and cover into a follow-on issuance.The one thing I'll say is that I'm not selling."
"HOLD into Monday it takes days to close out positions that huge, not even enough shares issued"
HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD
We’re tired of the shorties and the hedgefunds!!Hold long and strong!$AAL $ACB $AMC $GME
OH WE GOING!!! 19MIN!!!
"Stay calm, they have to cover over 140% outstanding short shares. They trying to manipulate you. Stay objective !"
"Yesterday’s shameless manipulation by the hedge funds, Robin Hood and other trading platforms just United us and made us stronger. Remember once the common people unites nothing can pull us down. Just hold and enjoy the shorts panic and cover their positions. GME’s destination is not the moon, it the Mars."
"WHAT'S THE END GAME??? ""HOLD"" UNTIL YOUR GAINS TURN TO LOSES???"
Your democracy is at stake here get out of robinhood and jump to another broker. How dare they stop people from making there own decisions. The hedge funds make billions and the poor man down the street is stuck in the gutter. Lets all move from robinhood and watch him lose millions
HOLD STRONG. Don't be scared by the $330s.
BUY BUY BUY! Let's have a great weekend!
"$GME $AMC $INO $NOK continues next week, next month, and next year until every one of them is $1,000."

"I bought into GME AMC BB BBBY through RBC Direct this morning. Am holding until the end. It's only $10K USD so I can afford to lose it, but am sticking with you all! Am not watching from the sidelines!"
"I think buying this stock right now is an absolute joke, I've been saying that all day. BUT... Robinhood, TD and Schwab trading restrictions should add fuel to this movement. I mean, how incredibly unfair!! They messed up. How hedge funds can short 140% of the shares outstanding is on them. The people banned together to exploit this. It's a fair market. I'm not long, but if I were, I'd be tempted to hold!!! I still think the big guys win, because they always do, but this is #$%$"
Thanks guys! Citron has stole some of my money and I love getting it back 50 fold! Long GME and OCGN
Ignore the bots.... All or nothing!!!
"Just curious, what is the poltical leaning of wsb? Democrat? Repulbican? Libertarian? Or just capitalist?"
Buying back in at 20
Only diamond hands left. So every sell you see is just a shortseller holding the rocket on the ground
We have brothers stuck at 400. We coming
"If no one sells, the squeeze will be on. Do NOT believe CNBC if they say Melvin has covered. No. It will take Melvin all of next week to cover. HOLD. Eventually the Fed will have to step in to buy the shares bc Melvin will go bankrupt if we hold."
Buy every dip.
"Interesting no one want to talk about 140% short on total GME shares outstanding or float which is clear criminal naked shorts manipulation to BK company and retail investors, but now everyone from those criminal shots ( incl hedge funds ) claim GME trading is illegal and should be banned."
Next week OTC will continue it's trend. The $GME $AMC $BB $NAKD phenomenon took the world by storm$MMEX $OPTI $TSNP $OZSC $PLYZ $BMIX $HCMC
Bee win friends - Citron announced “they’re going to discontinue their short selling research.”. Congrats!
Remember the goal is to keepIt at or above 9 don’t forget your allies at #Nok the whole trident must be sharpened #Nok #Amc #Gme
I’ll be surprised if Credit Suisse doesn’t sue some of these brokerages for causing market volatility.Next thing ya know Robinhide and TD Chinatrade won’t let you trade those ETFs.(UVXY)Where does this end? 
Braveheart meme hold. lol
Major lawsuits on robinhood as it goes under.. I dont think robinhood will survive this.. certainly their IPO is a pointless endeavor now since everyone will pound it down short!!
"So looks like they're (THE HEDGERS) using little guys for the PUMP and then they get to do another massive short sale dumping the price again, then again, then again? Meanwhile, the little guys keep buying? How is this winning? OK THEN."
They all want what you have. Hold it tightly!
"Ponzi schemeFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchFor schemes that promise rewards based on enrolling ever larger numbers of people, see Pyramid scheme.1920 photo of Charles Ponzi, the namesake of the scheme, while still working as a businessman in his office in BostonA Ponzi scheme (/ˈpɒnzi/, Italian: [ˈpontsi]; also a Ponzi game)[1] is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.[2] The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own."
Shorts currently
"it is legal for Robinhood to have system issues or to pull off trading ability, but it seems becoming illegal or SEC needs to check when Robinhood owner is involved in the short side of this particular stock as well, so to me it looks like interfere and conflict of interest."
Today we go to 1000$ lads
What is the exit strategy in a game in musical chairs?
This is continuing to be shorted.
Thumb me down - I m not negative on this movement at all.I’m a small contractor getting by.No fake here
"Tomorrow is the day we need absolute hold. Not only hold, please buy more if you can. This will push the squeeze faster and higher. Please don't backstab your comrades by selling cheap. To the moon. If you really have to sell, please don't go cheap."
"If a stock gets shorted into the ground and does a12:1 RS to keep listed on the exchange, trades at $1 pre split and has been at $50+ while its competitors trade at exponentially higher values and is and has been a RH favourite....who said $ACB???"

"Everyone listen up! Hold every single one of your shares! If we all hold our shares we can literally choose whatever price we want for EACH SHARE. Meaning if we all hold and we actually have to seriously hold. We can set GME's share price to be $10,000 per share if not even more! Spread the word. Hold your shares. This squeeze can literally make each share price to be at $10,000 if not even more! SPREAD THE WORD EVERYONE!"

Big block trade in the after hours. Looks like Warren B bought on valuation according to my analysts
"I am not in RH but why are people in it? I was in it for two weeks in July, and I hated the platform. There is no customer service number, and I remember last Spring the app froze up? If people have to stay there till these are clear, so be it, but you can open another brokerage account and start trading there."
More overseas investments coming. $amc has Saudi backing

"If I buy tomorrow and hold with everyone until it's over $1,000 a share will the hedgehogs be liquidated? I want to stick it to the big corporate crooks. I hope POTUS doesn't raise capital gains tax. I bet by this time next year we will be worth more than bitcoin! Go Gamestonk go!!!"
"Let’s be clear and please join WSB to verify NOK is all over that thread and they are on it as an investment heavy not as a short squeeze only because that makes little sense! ERIC is NOT on the WSB list at all and for the record I have nothing against ERIC it’s a decent company as well. $NOK is one of dominating stories for major reason that obviously much different than $GME, $AMC, $KOSS etc.... don’t listen to short manipulation efforts here by Ron, Patrick, Trader, Nico, Joe they all had 4.50 puts or at least they hinted that they did but the fact is they got burned bad today on low puts! Go join WSB to see the REAL STORY. See it with your own eyes. Long NOK!"
Anyone wants to publicly pledge to hold until tomorrow ?
"I'm in awe you young whippersnappers!But the fundamentals aren't there.When the selling starts, this will be ""fast and furious"".Put in a Stop at $325"

"You realize tomorrow they'll have to start covering. This is their play they banned trading and manipulated the price lower to start covering. They won't be able to cover fully, and as soon as market opens for us to trade it will rocket. Price is at a discount."
"Shorts focusing energy on pushing down NOK, they want to prove it is a one time thing with GME and AMC. Buy and hold. They are doing everything that they can to keep their rigged system in place. In this day and age it would be simple to attach a block chain address to every security, so their was no need for clearing (a tool the brokerages use to feed themselves and the big guys and steal from individual investors). It is time that the markets were made fair for all. Hedge funds and brokerages should not be able to use my shares to sell short and work against me. If they want to say that the little guy can’t buy on margin and can only trade on shares they actually own I am fine with that, as long as the brokerages, big money investors and hedge funds are playing by the same rules. Stand up for your rights, buy and hold all WSB stocks (because they are good companies that deserve our support)."
Where are all the lawsuits for Brokerages that shut down their platforms yesterday to purchase $GME and $AMC while the hedge funds were allowed to drive down the prices for those companies?
Games. Price loop dance on low volume. C’mon boomers
"600+ by 6 AM! Wake up guys, history is in the air!"
New highs r coming.
Thank you to everyone from WSB.....!:) get on the $LPCN rocket before it takes off
Everyone lock in a price limit orders if brokerage house uses your shares to short put a price daily on every stock make the shorts pay!
How much short interest here?If any one know?Short squeeze coming in big way 
"Robinhood made mistake they will loose 50% customers, as they are part of conspiracy and can’t trashed anymore. Go GME go our holy war."
"If you're out, sold out... go away! Thanks!"
How is it legal to have short interest at 120%+? SEC has to answer that. Glad GME traders shining a light on this.
"Here is the latest positive update for everyone:Finally we have a bunch of politicians backing us, and Mark Cuban too.They criticized the Brokerage firms for helping their hedge fund buddies to buy and sell freely, while restricting us from buying.They will do something to stop the illegal acts sooner or later.Stay tuned!"
This is.... well beautiful.
So can GameStop capitalize on this short squeeze and recapitalize by issuing more shares at this new higher price? Just asking.
WE HOLD
"If the experts thought it was a good short at $12.00, do you think it's a good short at $325?As long as you have the cash to cover a bump to $400, I think this is easier money than Mayweather v. the Irish guy."
We WILL be back in the GREEN before close
HOLD! Big big after hours!
what's a good app to trade on. I'm just getting into this stuff so I have no clue
"""40% wealth tax on Hedge Funds"""
DO NOT SELL FRIDAY - HOLD UNTIL NEXT MID-WEEK!
Move to a new Broker leave Robinhood he lied.
"RequirementsDear Client,We are seeing unprecedented volatility in GME, AMC, BB, EXPR, KOSS and a small number of other U.S. securities that has forced us reduce the leverage previously offered to these securities and, in certain instances, limit trading to risk reducing transactions. IBKR currently has no restrictions on trading shares in those companies, and customers can open or close positions in those shares. Like many other brokers, IBKR placed options on certain of those stocks in closing only earlier this week. The plan is to lift those restrictions in an orderly manner while closely monitoring market conditions. To be clear, IBKR has not restricted clients’ ability to close existing positions in any of the U.S. securities subject to market volatility, and does not plan to do so."
"Some misinformation is going around that I'd like to clear up. Shorts do NOT have to cover today. The significance of today is that a large number of option contracts are set to expire in the money (ITM) at market close. For each of those contracts, the market makers will need to purchase shares of $GME, which will ""flood"" the market with buyers and cause a ""Gamma Squeeze"". While this is all going on, people are shorting the stock, and those shorts have their own respective days to cover that are not tied to the options, but related because the gamma induced price spike will make them likely to close out more of their short positions."
HOLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE READ !!!!!!!! WALLSTREETBETS GANG !!!!!https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7qahx/gme_squeeze/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

GOOD BYE SHORTIES 
Why wouldn't a short buy call options as a hedge if they feared a squeeze?
who woulda thought ww3 would be done through stonks
"i was going to sell today. but after reading all the news i am infuriated. I am going to keep my shares until gme hits $10,000/share"
"A friend of mine had his account go up to $250k during the internet bubble. All highly speculative stocks. It crashed and he said “if it just goes back up to $250k again, I’ll sell.” It did. He didn’t. He lost it all."
The 2 major hedge funds that shorted this stock have closed their position. Right now you guys are not fighting against them. You are speculating against each other. Just make sure that you’re investing/speculating the money you are willing to lose. Don’t put all our retirement money into this. Just a friendly warning. Peace!
"BBBY has 74 million shares shorted, this can squeeze big time 8 analysts playing together.Buy and hold "
"Given the unprecedented windfall the senior brass in this company are now seeing with there stock and options, they should share some of that love with their loyal employees. Give them a little stock (sooner rather than later)."
Why is it going high? Wow
If you made 14 million trading this stock what would you do with your profits?
This tale will be the next big short movie. Buy and hold. Even one share. It’s your ticket to the financial event of the decade. Hold. There are only what 70m outstanding shares. Everyone hold a single share and David heats Goliath.
dont sell paper hands
FUnny thing is I can justify Gamestop value. They have an e-commerce segment growing at 300%!!!. If you apply the same multiples as the likes of MELI and SE to their e-commerce revenue. You can easily get 20B+ value.

"GME happens to be the unsuspecting vehicle for a larger movement. What I witnessed today makes me feel ashamed of being a free citizen in a free country. Every freedom loving American should rise today. It's not about GME. It's about - ""Play by the rules as long as elite makes money, but let's bend the rules when public makes some money, citing dire and vague market consequences"". A new kind of criminal has been exposed who has been in the shadows all along. WRITE to your REP and Senator. Like this post, if you agree - so this stays on top, until it gets deleted. I am writing emails now."
They cannot buy and cover if you do not sell. Hold long and strong. These short sellers have caused a lot of pain and misery for many investors over the years. It is payback time.
"Market is down because most brokers won't let you buy.Prices go up tomorrow when options expire and market makers have got to deliver.More importantly, do Schwab and the brokers have a problem? Maybe it's time to get direct registration or stock certs."

musk is moving all teslas cash into GME as a store of value.
I bought AMC but I believe GME is the flag of revolution. I am with you comrads!!!
"Take your gains, come to AMC, the fun is just beginning there!"
"Been an incredible two weeks, but I'm about done. Going to take the profit and buy some of dividend-producers that the hedgies are being forced to liquidate."
"The lesson here is that if you are a citizen of England and vote for Brexit, the elites will take five years and still won't allow you to leave the EU; if you voice an opinion that is the opposite of the mainstream media, Big Tech will cut off your access to social media and your own government will brand you a ""domestic terrorist""; and if you make Wall Street elites lose money, they will band the same Big Tech and social media to cut off your communication and your ability to trade stocks so the elites won't lose any more money. We don't have racial equity or gender equity issues -- what we have are CLASS EQUITY issues!"
GME is climbing. HOLD STEADY BOYS AND ENJOY THE RIDE.
"They shorted 100% of the float, they wanted more $$$, and shorted 140% of the float, that's real market manipulation! They are now bidding the price up trying to cover!"
Hedge Funds lost $14 billion on GME alone!  Thank you WSB

The Hedge Fund Shill Cramer has been absent recently. My guess is he has been beaten for not preventing the run on Game Stop.

we are coming for you
We did it boys and girls!!!!
Brokerage firms just forced investors to selling a stock at a loss in order for hedge funds and professionals to come back in and cash in on their short positions. People need to go to jail for this one.
BUY NOWHOLD THE LINE
OUCH!!!...close the windows!! Don’t jump out the dorm window!
Glad I am a part of this with my measly 10 shares. Every bit counts. Hold!
"Hmm. If nobody sells, and the stock is 150 percent short and the options are sold out by 5 months.. where the hell does that leave the stock price to go?"
"It’s a true shame that some people don’t understand what is going on... i expect a large rally tomorrow morning then a sell off (and i truly hope that does not happen)... I won’t tell you what to do, but I advise you to hold onto your shares, this is a revolution and selling goes against the entire point of this movement... so if u see this message, tell everyone u know that owns gme amc shares etc... to buy & hold, and thus we will come out on top"
NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY
"if WSB is illegal, then arrest all analysts who recommend and set price targets on stocks.On second thought just arrest everyone at Goldman Sachs."

Once more into the breach my friends!
For all of you who were telling people to sell
"So google deleted over 100,000 bad reviews on Robinhood? Sleazy at best."
Everything these guys are doing and it's still going back up. Good luck ending the day neutral Citadel. SEC is finally watching.
Where can we see updated short % info? Jan 15th is last update I see.
Game Stop planning to go more eCommerce. We can buy all games/ console and everything they sell exclusive from them. This stock can worth $10000 easily if every retail investor do that.
"These hedges have PUMPED the general DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 to being crazy green today to combat them completely destroying these stocks we’ve been pushing lately. Thats gonna try and be their scapegoat to avoid the corruption and wrongdoing on what has happened today. They’re blatantly doing this right in front of us and they ACTUALLY think they won. $BB $GME $AMC $NOK are all like one giant spring thats continuously being pushed down by this buying halt on them. The longer this continues, the more agitated retail investors are going to get and the more fuel these stocks are going to accumulate. I wouldn’t be surprised if this buying halt continues into tomorrow so they can avoid the worst of people exercising their contracts. But it doesn’t matter. We are launching into a different galaxy next week; like we’ve never seen before."
"QUESTION: If most platforms were restricting the buying of this asset, could it not be the hedge funds running this up so that when restrictions are lifted and more retail buys in .... they get dumped on? How was this able to run up that much if retail trading was restricted? If someone could answer I would be grateful. Thanks and good luck."
Even though Robinhood only allow to buy 1 share of GME. Its still sky rocketing. I am holding my line. Let's Go baby!!!
buy buy buy
buy buy before market closes goodluck all
This is the best message board ever! Not playing the game but you guys are delivering for this one spectator! Good luck to you all tmrw on your quest to hit $1000
"$GME is our first stronghold and $AMC is our number 2. It might be a rough few weeks, but Apes together STRONG. BUY and HOLD"
$40 close tomorrow.Options will settle with cash instead of stock and the stock shortage will almost disappear.
"I love that Stevie Cohen got screwed, LOVE IT. but bc this can't go on forever, he or anyone else can make more money NOW shorting this with fresh dollars as soon as volume tapers of. If Cohen doesn't short from 325 down, someone else will. The problem with the buy-side logic is there is no END GAME. Unless someone can explain this coherently, this will go back down. You can't lie about that, or you're just as bad as them."
"25 MINUTES lets buy more, PUSH IT UP!!!!"
"Fascinating to watch the scammy manipulation right now with this tanking from +500 to 190s in a matter of minutes. Halt,drop,halt, drop. Hope a lot of the little guys were at least holding spreads not underlying and are getting out with some $."
More power to people. I love you guys
"Andrew Left is not the only #$%$ out there.... check out Adam Feuerstein.....another manipulative #$%$ who spread lies about $GERN....Geron stock. He always spreads lies and fud about the company and says that they have flimsy data. This company has outstanding data!...Gern is in two phase 3 trials with unmatched data which will soon become the standard of care for cancer. This company has disease modifying results but still trades in the $1.70 range and is heavily shorted. The share price may creep up to 2 but then is heavily shorted back down. People suffering from cancer need this drug, but the shorts are having their way with this stock."
#BOYCOTTYAHOO...They are now trying to censor us and limit our right or speech and free trade!!
THE DAILY FLAT SPELL! BUY NOW! BUY THE ASK! WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS!
Kieth Gill LEGEND!
450 Monday???
Buy this dip
The shorting has not started yet. Bets are end of the day. DO. NOT. FALL. FOR. IT. Look at trading volumes on tradingview (Google it) there is barely ANYONE selling right now. Its algorithms. WE GOT THIS BUT WE MUST HOLD STRONG TOGETHER.
"Everyone needs to raise their high sell limits to $20,000. I am not kidding....this short squeeze could go on forever. I wouldn't doubt those with $1000 limits won't get triggered at the open tomorrow."
whats the plan when it reachs $1000 will go upper or we should sell ?
"THE $AMC GAME PLAN!WSBs plan is to have limit orders for $1,000 so the shorts covering have no choice but to buy back their shares at $1,000 each, so this will be our plan aswell. Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone did. This means that AMC's stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000.Because $AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of today no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.LFG $AMC $GME $BB $NOK $NAKD $SNDL"
Don’t sell when this hits 1000+. Volkswagen Story needs a sequel!!!
Yahoo not putting $AMC or $GME as a trending stock in the search bar.They are trying to push us out.
Huge number of options expire tomorrow. Halting buys on robinhood and trading outages are a last ditched attempt at driving price down so shorts can unwind positions and cover. You sell now there was no point in doing this in the first place. Hold until Friday if you want to see the true squeeze.

"They can pull out all the tricks they want but at the end of the day the fundamental situation of them being over-shorted has not changed. Sure, they will scare some into selling but come tommorrow when all these calls end in the money, the price will sky-rocket as they are forced to buy back millions of shares at whatever price we choose. Hold steady, you will be rewarded."
"Shorts will never be able to recover from this IF ""they haven't already got out of their position"", keep this momentum and and this will be world changing"
Gang the hedge funds
And Up We Go!!!
"I understand the Gamestock play. Sticking it to the hedge fund Wall Street guys. They have been hurt. But Gamestock doesnt need saved. It will eventually close as all games will be able to be downloaded right to your console. AMC is the company that needs saved. Thats where stock need to be bought and held. Thats the business I dont want to see lost. Going to the movies, albeit pricey anymore, is one of the simple pleasures in life. Im buying AMC to support them."
Closed yesterday at 193. We have held well today and will close a lot higher. Glad to be part of this.
People are buying it on Fidelity so buy buy buy!
"Let the rich pay!! United we stand, divided we fall ! "
All the people cheering this on either have 1-5 shares or mostly broke people buying options because they don’t have enough money for real stock! If you have 500k in GameStop. I’m sure you will feel this is hella risky!
"PEOPLE FROM CHINA, UK, NORWAY, AUSTRALIA, HK, SINGAPORES, Brazil and all.... TRADING GME RIght Now !!! LETS UNITE TOGETHER and SMASH SHORTS and Hedge Funds Now !!!!!"
1 hr to go watch out for short raids and attacks to create panic selling.They need panic selling to get out!!When they push price down buy buy buy. I have funds ready to go!!
HOLD ON AND GET HIGH! 
"Hey guys after this runs over 10k per, who’s down for shorting the Robinhood IPO? "
"Article posted by CNBC:“I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said."
NOBODY SELL!
Rage against the Machine
GME is the new Bitcoin. We set our own price and no one right to stop us!
"I LIKE THE STOCK, IM NOT SELLING!"
Trading stopped by SEC!!? More Manipulation! HOLD THE LINE
HOLD & SET UR SELL @2500
340 in germany! Doom loop for shorts tightening again!Fact!
why the price is going up after market? I was thinking the shares tommorow
Both Fidelity and Vanguard have millions of shares of GME and have no restrictions. They are trying to help people set up accounts quickly so those who use Robinhood or other brokers who have restricted GME and other stocks can trade freely.
Buy something from GME - raise the street price - raise the stock make em eat it.
"Robinhood gave up, definitely down the road they will pay multimillion dollars in class action."
shorts tried to suppress prices this morning. by now they realized the floor is held strong. and now they are slowly buying back to cover. let the climb begin guys. I bought 8 more shares!
Shorting has become too much illegal...and retail has send a message to shorts...you do play with fire...Cudos to Andy Left....he knows the business
Why is it so flat at the moment? Someone explain

What happened to GME and AMC? I am not following lately but all i see is market manipulation tweets on Twitter. Pls throw some light . Thnx
Afterhours is always like this. WE HOLD!
"if you go to bank and try to take loan , they won't allow 100% of asset. When you take loan against anything, really you shorting what you own for money.Shorting stock should work same way. If you short stock you need 1.5 share borrowed not just 1. We will automatically limit on how much you can short."
$GEVO
"Ignore the shills, don't switch to another stock. GME is still shorted way above 100%, shorties are paying millions in premiums, they'll have to buy every share at $1000 or above. Keep holding! "
"Interactive Brokers froze my positions. All the fun stocks AMC, BB, EXPR, GME, and KOSS you can't trade anymore. All you can do is close or hold. You cannot make an adjustment. You cannot, for example, change the strike price on a call that you bought. You could not roll the call forward to a future week. You can't do anything. Either close it or hold it and that's it. If you made an error, put on a trade you didn't like, and try to remove it five minutes later, they would block you. It happened to me once. I accidentally closed an option and then changed my mind and wanted to buy it back, but could not. The option was available for the same price that I sold it. The market maker was happy to sell it back to me. But Interactive Brokers would not allow it. One directional trading only. Not too happy about it. There were some profitable trades today that I could not make because they froze me out."
everyone who lost money to DOW being down because WE are forcing people to sell their stakes to cover thier losses are here trying to get you tpo sell and stop this..MUTE them.
"How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.So what does that mean for us?Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY SOON. They are bleeding out with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering."
$ AMC and $GME LETS GOOOOOOOO
"The shares I bought (if I loss this sum of money , it doesn't hurt)... Therefore, I will just hold regardless... For the spirit !!!"
"Unless you only hold this stock, they are draining the rest of everyone else's portfolio. Not an advantageous long term solution"
https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355163433700745220?s=20ill just leave this here
This is the MM last attempt. Hold strong and watch GME rocket back up
I'm holding firm and strong... :)
"Do not sell! They need you to sell so they can move calls out of the money. If you do not sell, Mon is the absolute reckoning!"
Robinhood is toast. What broker are people switching to?
They are even trying to manipulate the after hours by constantly bouncing back to the closing price not the last trade—
Up 67% today. Wait until Monday. It'll hit 400+ guaranteed!
HOLD THE LINE...
push now!!!!
THE ONLY TWO STOCKS WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON ARE #GME and #AMC
"Well, afterhours stock shooting up- 272."
"Bullish on Silver.1) Silver is heavily shorted and a spike in buying physical can send prices higher.2) Democrats want more green energy and silver is a key component of solar panels. That is more demand.3) Many people on WSB were talking about doing a silver short squeeze AFTER they are done with $GME. So this hasn't started yet.4) Silver has unique properties for industry. Silver is the most reflective metal and the best metal for conducting heat and electricity. It also has anti-microbial features, which is why it has some medical uses.5) Silver has a history of being a monetary metal, with people worried about money creation some are buying it as a hedge against a potentially weakening dollar.What to do...Buy physical this puts the pressure on. Preferably real American Eagles of PSLV. There is a reason Robinhood just removed PSLV from its platform, Eric Sprott guarantees the purchase of real silver. This will put a squeeze on the shorts.Then to try for bigger gains, put a small portion in silver miners like SLVP or do call options.$PSLV $SLVP $SLV"
"Margin calls are about to start being forced. Hold that line, we could see $480 again today. When that happens, all hell breaks loose Monday. DIAMOND HANDS"
Is RH allowing buys on GME and AMC?
Hedge funds took reddit down lol. I buy more.
Just hold!
What is the Short Position on GME currently? Melville Capital and Citron have disclosed that they closed their short positions.
Whole world is watching...BUY and Hold...taking it to 1000
"For once the small guy will set the rules, will you join us and hold to valhalla? "
every share matters!!!Buy whatever you can to help the cause.I bought 1000 AMC and 10 GMEYou can too.!My uneducated opinion.
it's not about money anymore
Who cant sleep tonight?
I’m holding GME and NTN to the moon!
I'm with you guys...no one can stop us!!!
Hey how does everybody feel about shorting/put options on Robinhood's IPO?
1-2-3 PUSH!!!!
330+ in Germany
Sold today’s 450 calls for 30.00. I bet GME closes today below 100.00. There will be massive selling as there is no way small fish have money to cover today’s calls and take delivery of stock. Watch and learn
After hours is up because they want people to sell at their average. Do not make that mistake. We the people > Wall St. $amc $nok $gme to the moon and no one is stopping us  #HOLD
"its a joke only sell and not buy??? that should be lawsuits, my opnion."
This is it boys. What a sweet revenge on Wall Street!
"I don�t own GME or any other of the stocks mentioned here. I am a small-time investor playing with money I can afford, subsidizing my annual salary by about 20 % in a good year (and absorb losses in the same range in a bad one). I don�t do short-selling, bad karma. But let me tell you something I have observed over and over again: short squeezes start quickly and end quickly. Every single squeeze shows as a sharp spike in the charts. Look it up, think about it, it�s logical. This here is NOT a squeeze anymore. It has evolved into a pyramid scheme where many smart ppl will profit big time, but many more, the believers in a ""squeeze"", will lose out badly. Everyone telling you to hold further is either clueless or wants to pump that even more. Completely uninformed mobs diving into random (usually penny) stocks, driving their price into the stratosphere and the leaders of the pack cashing out big time is happening for some years now, and it�s getting increasingly out of hand. Please dump that get rich quickly mindset fueled by Youtube stories about a few lucky ones, sell this #$%$ asap, and get into fact-based decision making. It will bring you more money than those adventures, it just takes more time. Peace."
Halted because it was going up 
"Hedge Fund redemptions and the alternate end gameNot much beyond a smooth brain, but how likely is it that hedge funds will experience massive fund redemptions from clients nervous about the fall out of the GME saga. This would crush their buying power and force widespread liquidation of their assets to include covering all GME shorts. Even the latest rounds of capital infusions would not be able to stem the rush to the exits by HF investors that see the writing on the wall of shame... the PR nightmare alone must have institutions and pension funds lining up to get out of HF tied to the GME battle"
HOLD!!!! THEIR SCARE TACTICS ARE NOTHING TO US
bought ONE share today and I'm UP 23 bucks! WOOOOO chess not checkers

"Only $20BN damage to shorts till now.Lets make it $200 BN in this week GameStop short sellers are still not surrendering despite nearly $20 billion in losses this monthKEY POINTS • Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19.75 billion year to date in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, according to data from S3 Partners. • Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock. • GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3. • Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days."
tomorrow gonna be big
I'm rooting for you guys. Keep fighting!!

If you are truly here to stick it to the big cats hold and it'll get better. They're trying to drive the price down so people will sell causing it to drop more and help there side

$GME I’ve never seen shorts claim they are winning when a stock is up over 50%. This is truly remarkable. They must be on some heavy doses of drugs.’ They are gonna need a lot more in the mental institution.
"hmmm..a Long time since I been on a Yahoo thread...well...its still the Same...I am Not a Gamer...but have great interest in THIS game...I expect a Lot of movement in this ""battle stock""...both DOWN...and UP...Next week I envision Lots of Volatility...IF by chance I do well trading...I will find a GameStop location...and Buy something...They still carry Donkey Kong...???...lol...""Power to the Players""...!!!..."

"GameStop, Silver Squeeze Sounds Alarm for Major Market Crash Warns Vince Lanci/watch?v=jPkP4xiaQAYIndustry insider and Zerohedge contributor Vince Lanci says that Wall Street giants are crying foul after being beaten at their own game by a new generation on the Internet.

""This will end very badly,"" warns the veteran trader, noting that it signals the start of a market meltdown."
"Obligatory execution of option will force the price dramaticaly up..because MMs will have to buy tons of shares on free market.... options if executed, will mean thousansd percenst of bonuses... my broker has confirmed... expect big attack of shorts before the close... they need $150"
I don't think the line is as tight as it should be... all those in the money calls were triggered and no spike in share price. So why is there a belief there is illiquidity to create a short squeeze? If the Gamma Squeeze failed there is no short squeeze...
Rumors baiji and validimar are helping citron recover the loss. That’s why they restricted the trades. They need to be jailed.

sec is in verge to sue game stop traders. just because they lost terrible amount of money. do not sell the stock. they are trying to scare us. just hold tight. we have our rights.

"Yahoo Finance shows that GME had a whopping 226.42% short ratio on January 15th. How can you find out the most current short ratio? I would expect that the short ratio dropped in the past days as the short sellers were force to cover/buy back shares. Also, some more options will expire tomorrow, Jan 29th. How will this affect the stock price next week?"

I still haven’t heard many answers? Did anybody see this rise to 5000 a share at a halt and options?
"DO. NOT. SELL. They are opening a ton of new short positions because they are most certain that the internet will be scared into selling, not just here, but every other trending stock. Do not fold under pressure, they’re already counting us out and that we will all fold. Apes together strong!!!!"
Bought 15 shares at 255. HOLD
&AMC stock Board is lit up. They broke the HF on their short position yesterday. Their talking Monday’s plays and execution plan. It’s amazing what they learned from you guys at $GME....Strong feeling their going to blow it out this weeks and see massive rise in the stock on top of what’s already been done. $13.00+ from $3.00 in one week. They are focused on hitting $100.
The halt time today is outpacing the trading time haha.
HODL.We're not just here to make money. We're here to make a point.You can't just short an American Company into the ground.People who were going to take profits already did that on Wednesday and Thursday.

"$GME Game Over, shorts. Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop, GameStop!"
"It isn’t hard to see what is occurring. It isn’t hard to understand what move the funds will next make. The problem is that you can’t know when they will make it. This goes up consistently $30-40, then drops $60 because a fund dropped a huge short sale. People panic and sell. Buyers think they’re getting a deal and buy, driving the price back up. Lather rinse and repeat."
The short attack could be starting. Let's see if we can hold dam.
given they required 100% margin there is no margin calls risk. This is huge + for longs I think. They though margin call will create huge sell off but people able to navigate yesterday so well ( part of reason is political angle which pressure Hedge fund/ Market maker to cover their risk at higher prices - As it would look clear cut taking advantage of retail investor when SEC go though detail)
Ok I purchased my 1 share of GME right now! I totally support the movement. I have a few in AMC NAKD and a boat load in NOKLet's GO

"I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.” still 113% shorted!"
Can anyone explain how long the squeeze happens for? Will this peak in minutes? Hours? Sustained increase over days? Concerned of brokers playing dirty tricks like force log outs etc when the lift off happens. Already had awful experience with 212 over the last couple of days.
buy the dip!!!
LET'S DO THIS 1000 WORLD IS WATCHING SO EPIC!!!

(If yesterday they allowed me I would up by 200K than what I have today but for that I may need to fight lawsuit. Not sure i can find good lawyer who have gut to go after big fish and agree for % reward as fee. If not it's waste of time so I will give try with few lawyers and stop. May still join class action lawsuit including as lead plentif if they find sufficient to prove that I didn't make $200K profit because of broker's illegal action.)"

Volkswagen had only 12% shares shorted when it skyrocketed to the 1000. -With 10x bigger short interest, GME will be at least order of magnitude bigger... extremely violent gamma squeeze."
Is this AH boost the hedge funds covering?
"Team, very simple they want what we have. Don't give it to them. Period! HODL!!"
"I feel like the hedges are going to start betraying each other, which will benefit us. All it takes is one to give into a hold, and they could gain back their loss and help the squeeze more, which would benefit us. They are just fighting to not be the worst side of the deal."
"Yes boys let’s go. Game time, prepare for battle tomorrow and we hold strong together. We can only keep winning if we keep fighting strong. So badly fir everyone in this movement"
everything is gonna go back up in a hour or so
"So Robinhood resumes after hrs trading gme,amc,koss etc but interactive brokers,etrade etc still partialy suspends buying these stocks. So robinhooders have serious advantage over retailers from other brokerages robbing them of free and equal trading opportunities!!!!! This is manipulation at SEC needs to step in for equal and free trade to all."
I'M SO PROUD OF EVERYONE FOR HOLDING. I can't wait for the gamma squeeze next week
"3 things make me happy. Watching shorts burn, making money with all the bulls here, and holding. Deal with it. Bye"
"ROCKETS READY, 15 min for TTAKE OFF"
YOU GUYS DID IT!!!!
Dude everyone at my work is buying. That’s like 5000 people.
"Nok and Bb are shorted the same with the potential to start the squeeze as options expire. Heads up, bb already 20% pre."
If you think this is over ask yourself how this wont dip below 220? Its a company that had a value of 2$ a share. This is far from over. You're going to miss the train if you bail now people #diamondhands
"What, did the wrong people manipulate the market this time!!!"
28 billion market cap and the stock was at 500.at $600 market cap will be near 60 Billion. The same as Electronic arts. I think GME should buy Electronic arts in a stock deal. They could buy Macy's right now. Macys is sitting on a bunch of real estate assets. Maybe buy M and AMC . At this valuation they have lot's of possibilities.
This will go up just as fast as it went down. That was an artificial selloff with low volume. HOLD
citron keep after that company. break the SUITS.
"I head somewhere that for every $7 price change in GME, the hedges are on the hook for a Billion dollars.If 6 million people buy 10 shares, the most we lose in all of tbis is a few thousand whatever. The hedge funds however..... their heads will roll.Hold this with diamond hands. Your feet are on their NECKS"
Holding here in Canada
"I holded $445 , 45shares..."
"Not a single person against this has put up any reasonable argument (other than they lost money when the market went red, please stop) yet they call wallstreetbets the unsophisticated investors, who have pages and pages of fundamentals and logic reasoning to back this up."
Manipulation with news sources saying they covered and are going bankrupt. They haven’t covered!!!! Hold
and here we are. HOLD.
"From WSB (about short ladder attacks):""It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, in reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off.) ""Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors.""https://preview.redd.it/7fzsbti8i3e61.jpg?width=504&auto=webp&s=12d5aab924ac8ca87315b059e8322549631c6a63"
"20K in, doubled profit, should I hold until the market opens or order sell for profit? Very skeptical of the 1,000 anticipated goal?"
GME is so power full
Shorts...
Thumbs up if WE LIKE THE STOCK
"Yeah, you guys rock! Keep up the pressure. HOLD. They will have to resume trading soon!"
At what price point and for how long does this stock need to maintain in order to flush out all or most of the shorts? Anyone have a handle on this?
Bears: It's Gambling!!!! Longs:
Think about this: if 10million calls are expiring today some of that has to be hedges from the shorts.
"The movement has good intentions with a bad result. The rest of the market is pulling out as speculation runs in. If stocks are not based off fundementals and companies like Apple can have good earnings and go down something is wrong. It's almost an incentive for a company to get shorted for ppl to find value in it. Look at the SnP and the Dow this movement was meant for the retail investor ,yet retail investors across the board are losing money in different sectors. This is because institutional investors are pulling there money leaving retail with the bag across the board. This is either to protect there investment or to cover there shorts in other positions. Either way it's had a negative effect on the market as a whole. Even if these guys flood to bitcoin it's more likely to cause institutions to pull out due to speculation rushing in. Everyone in these stocks aren't using a coordinated sell order. This means that when profit taking finally happens allot of people will get hurt and loose savings. It will be a domino effect of emotions and some ppl will come out rich and others broke. Everyone forgets the robinhood investor that committed suicide losing all his savings this is not the only story. People are new investors and don't understand at some point profit taking is unavoidable. Please be save you van tell ppl only spend what you can loose but most don't listen. I get the movement and also hate short sellers but if solving a problem hurts more who's the villain of the story.This movement is coordinated by very smart investors with allot of money in low theynwill be the first to pull the rip cord. They got everyone else to join because they created a relatable story based off the greed in Wallstreet. The problem is the foundation is coordinated and based off making money so when do they decide the party ends"
Lmao at the shorts acting like this 30% is hurting us .. I’m up 885% + still

"If it gets dicey. Come on over!!!!AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (AMC) Stock Forum & Discussion - Yahoo FinancePLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:AMC current status (30JAN2021) :AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday My recommendation: 1. HOLD2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it’s all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you’re dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And don’t forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I’ll see you on the moon  "
"Survey Time: at the end of regular trading of GME on Friday, is the stock UP or DOWN? Give a Thumbs Up for UP, and a Thumbs Down for Down."
"Anyone who have accounts with RH or brokerages that blocked them should go to a brokerage that did not block people. Not a free market if you allow shorts to cover and not allow retailers to buy. We do not need government to step in and slap hedge funds for wrong doing , let the market correct their bad behavior. This is bull and manipulation."
ALL THE WAY UP!!!!!!!
Someone needs to sue the brokers who wouldnt allow GME investors to buy !

Why do experianced stock traders seem so puzzled at the activity in GME. It's classic! I love this kind of trading. I have been a stock picker for 40 years. I have no complaints. All of Wall Street is like going to a casino. We should all know that! So what is the problem?
"Ask Elon Musk, he must show support. He can hide behind because he used this to achieve his personal vandetta. Now we really need to make sure paper profit he show convert to real profit.It's his job to make sure that."

"I’m going to admit that it’s easier to lose than it is to win. But, in my little world I continue to survive after losing big.The trick of trading is not to get ahead of your tolerance for thinking with some caution and setting up a few cones and caution tape if it’s feeling a bit out of the box"
This only happens during the pandemic because almost every one can become a trader ! Retail investors can organizing a club to against hedge funds’s short sellers !

"They are going to try and slow trading as much as possible today, along with selling to their friends for next to nothing is the only way they can drive the price down.

If they get it to their short position they will double or more their multibillion dollar position and pay off all their friends that helped manipulate the market these past few days. (CNBC, ROBINHOOD AND FREINDS) The only way for us to win or atleast make them suffer is to HOLD and BUY dips."

"Andrew Left, Citron, and anyone like these institutional manipulators are getting what?s coming to them. Andrew Left has a history of manipulating stocks for his own personal gain. NIO is a highly reputable company and has a lot going for its future. If you look at the EV company NIO for example which is basically the Tesla of China or IMHO (The Tesla legend Killer) you will see that Citron and Andrew Left tried to short NIO and gave it a $25 price target. They came out with some #$%$ research a few stating that the model Y will put compete any NIO car. What happened next? The stock went down of course because of the fear that Andrew Left caused. Investors, mostly retail investors like the working class, basically sold their shares to Andrew Left and he profited off his little scam. But about 3 weeks later NIO managed to pump out the shorts. Bottom line is, these crooks like Andrew Left are getting what they deserve! Let?s pump these guys out and force them to pay for all the hurt the caused retail investors!"

"Everyone wants the squeeze to end.The retail brokers want it to end.The prime brokers (wall street banks) want it to end.The clearing firms want it to end.The SEC wants it to end.The hedge funds want it to end.A follow-on issuance is the best way to do that. And it's the right thing for the shareholders, the company, the employees, the US economy. The BOD has a bit more negotiating power here. They do have a dedicated owner base that does not want to sell, and holds the position in cash so does not need financing or risk etc.How do we get everyone to be adults and deliver something of value to them in exchange for their stock purchase? Well, the shorts cut a check to the company and exit their short. And everyone walks away with a company that now has $250 or maybe even $350 cash per share if the board is good negotiators and nobody is crying unfair.It's worth 10-20 bucks a share to get some transparency on who really had to cover what and make that all public, and how much of that was naked shortselling. That's part of what some longs were buying.Monday morning, we're a different company, the stock is probably less volatile, and it probably trades above the issue price if the BOD comes out with a sketch of what the turnaround looks like, and what kind of management they're looking to hire."
Hedge funds have been making a lot of money for shorting stocks and killing retail investors. We’re retail investors buying stocks with our hope will have enough money for our retirement ! Our wishes have been ruining by hedge funds. Now hedge funds asking Congress to help them ! Congratulations to all retail investors owning GME !
This is similar to a Pyramid Scheme. First ones out win. Last ones out Lose Big.

"From someone on AMC -Please Share to spread awareness:I'll do my best to sumarize what is going on in this AMC stock. This here is a triangle between Melvin Capital management, Citadel and Robin Hood. Citadel is a huge head fund worth billions upon billions or dollars that is 'coincidentally' partners with both Robin Hood and Melvin capitals. They in fact recently invested 2.75 billion dollars in Melvin capital management 3 days ago (you can look it up it's on WSJ on bloomberg). Melvin capital is the company we are targeting ATM. They have massive short positions in AMC and in fact they shorted even more today when the stock was halted. So, as you probably guessed, AMC is getting shorted by Melvin Capital with the money citadel is giving them through the partnership. So now, Citadel and Melvin Capital are bleeding and arepretty much going all or nothing on this because they do not want us to have their money (that they steal from us everyday in the first place). And then, 'coincidentally' Robin hood (again, partners with Citadel) dosen't allow you to buy shares through their app. It's the small guy vs 3 giants. Is it legal? No. Will they get away with it? Because of how great the community is, probably not but they have a lot of ressources. So hold. Just so that you guys realise how much money we can make, they are literally holding millions of people down by themselves. This will be the greatest short squeeze in the history of the market because frankly, they won't ever do something like this because of how scared they will be. Otherwise they will face the wrath of the millions behind this movement. WE ARE HUGE. TOGETHER WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL. Tomorrow is the most critical day for this movement. Give it all you have. We will win."

Robinhood is apparently going so far as to liquidate GME shares in accounts that are not using margin trading(!) If you're still on robinhood, you should find a new broker ASAP. Retail brokers who didn't stab their clients in the back include: ◦ vanguard ◦ td ameritrade ◦ fidelity"
Biden admin. REALLY should (clean house) weed out corruption at the SEC! It's been going on too long- Conspiracy between Brokerage Houses to build up price of a given stock- pre-Market- only to sell at the open the next day! They don't worry about the price spread -because they are market makers in each targeted Stock!
If someone wants to sue robinhood I am in. We should get our boney back if they are blocking us from buying.this bad business.
Hope that borrowing stock to short should stop from lesson we learn from GME. Long live the retail investors.

A lot of talk now about whether or not trading firms are responsible for protecting traders from themselves. Regulation is needed. I say Bull S&oT Everyone who opens an account on a trading platform knows going in that it is a risk. The stock market is a risk. I don't want anyone telling me what I can and can't do with my money. If I want to burn it up on bad trades thats on me and it's my responsibility.
I am wondering whether or not someone in WS will jump from the top of their skyscraper.
Why don’t all of you form an entity that buys out Game Stop altogether? Then the people will own the company rather than hedge funds.
If you can afford it - buy! If you can't just HOLD!! LET'S DO 400
Wow pre-market is on fier - buy and wait till EOD
CNBC still shows the real AH price. What’s going on with yahoo???
Why is after hours price going down
memes win.
"GME is the proof that the next generation and innocent deserve the right to make money and do it on an open forum. This stock showed the entire markets that not only the rich and wealthiest can make money or control what they want and when they want. The REDDIT forum deserves a standing ovation as the community of people who are not experts in trading or rich came together as one! Now!! all the rich and wealthy politicians and business are upset as nothing but a bunch of stay at home and live in your bedroom checking out your posts have made more money in one or two days. All i can say is, nothing wrong with making money. Supporting yourself and posting it live. Telling everyone where we need to invest together as a community. This was all open and done on a forum and nothing was hidden so what is wrong with that? Absolutely nothing as there was no gun pointed at anyone's head making you do something to #$%$ of your money! As for the silver bugs and now this metal was also a target to buy SLV on Reddit. Smartest move as this was all done on the same evidence to stick together and share your opinion to invest. So i went out and bought more of the silver junior explorers space. good luck to all....i bought a lot of Finlay Minerals if anyone is interested. cheers."
I bought GME at 385. Will I recover? Please let me know what I should do.
"No dog in the fight, but I would absolutely love to see the Reddit / WSB / Elon Musk / eff the funds crew coordinate gargantuan buys at the open tomorrow. You’d have a worthless company valued at more than Oracle, the hedge funds would implode and a bunch of the little guys would get rich. Ain’t gonna happen, of course, but would sure be fun to watch."
"NO ONE IS SELLING, DIPS ARE ARTIFICIAL. HOLD."
"You see what happened? Now it's in mainstream media, celebrities and everybody knows about this stock and wants a piece of the pie. All you haters can say what you want, but this ain't the stock market of the past... Things are changing, people are waking up, and these Reddit kids (dumb or smart as they may be) have found a way to create awareness for manipulation of markets that effect everybody!So my conclusion, you can't stop GAME STOP... Buy!"
HOLD THE LINEWE WILL MAKE HISTORY MONDAY
Litteraly everyone is leaving robinhood hahahahahaahaha

Where is this going in pre-trade?
I made a video about GameStop ($GME)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sQ-pK8gsYII suggest to Ignore Citadel and Robinhood.

How GME detonated the pandemic stock market bubble — headlines from the future
"650 strike calls available when market opens. SOOOOOOO given past performance an above 700 close is more likely than not. OCC will do what OCC does. Hedgies can't headfake that. ""Assignment"" is the word of the month."
GOTTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please stop buying this stock. You are going to lose a LOT of money. Probably 95 percent of what you buy
"Asian billionare, Justin Sun, will be buying $1 million worth of gme tonight"
"GameStop absolutely knows what they are doing. They’ve been quiet, but if they are about to issue their sells, we’ll now all the sudden we are investing into the most shorted stock, that now has billions more cash! The value will rise as more money floods. It’s not like it’s stuck at its original value?"
Hello guys I am from Asia an also here this came into the news. Many people from all over the world will let the hedge funds feel the pain.
THANOS WOULD BE PROUD OF OUR DIAMOND HANDS BOISSS!
"DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.It's not guaranteed. The only thing that is guaranteed is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON."
What happens now?
bought 50 at 208
Hold and throw a little at Nakd. Cheap shares and hold.
Amazing how the media and the SEC are protecting illegal naked short selling and blaming legal reddit group for legal purchases . The swamp has evolved into an ocean that is contaminated with pollution .
"Hey guys, all we need to do, is buy some shares and hold it. Please don’t go all-in think you are going to get rich lol, too much risk. We will make them pay by simply buying a few shares per person and simply hold it. They can’t buy if we don’t sell. Simple as that :)"
I AM NEVER SELLING
"Lets talk $GME shorts vs De-Fi. When someone shorts a stock that is already heavily shorted, they have to pay a fee to borrow that stock. In the case of $GME that fee has been hovering around 30% this week. Shorts have to pay (Price x .30)/360 per day. In DeFi thats a 30% APY.MARK CUBAN, TWITTER"
The entire world trades the US exchange and this is all the volume afterhours?
The middle class bites back!!
Give to us a list of stocks that are the most shorted ... they can not block the whole market
Everyone should sell FAANG stocks to buy GME. Hedge funds use those as bank accounts to cover their shorts

HOLD UNTIL $1000 LET'S GOOOOO
Wow!!!! Congratulations

why doesnt it show the aftermarket price update anymore? can someone explain to me?
Give this comment a thumbs up if you support the common man  Moonday we feast like kings 
"They're doubling down today. If we HOLD, they will fall tomorrow and Monday!"
Dont sell people. If you sell then you are no better than the big banks that took bailout money and then used that money to pay themselves big bonuses and then lobby the government to not regulate the crooked system. If you sell you are no better than these people! Even if this stock goes to $1000 I'm not selling.... I consider it a donation to re-establish a free market system and democracy.
There is still a HUGE short position. Do not listen to corporate fake news. Buy and hold! Burn shorts burn
"Let’s not lose this fight, buy all the shares you can and hold your shares with diamond hands , let’s goooo $GME $AMC $BB $NOK"
"i divorced my wife, sold the house, and put my life savings in GME at 320!! Woo!"
"I agree, you have a good motive. Just make sure you do not hurt yourself. You are playing with fire. This company does not belong to $400 ps. And a lot of you guys will need cash soon. So sell off is imminent. Make sure you are not the last to sell"
"Simple answer to Why these hedge funds and cynics can’t believe this is above $300 on Friday (same reason they don’t believe you can get to $1500); ANSWER: greedThe market has always been dominated by greed. Even retail investors tend to bail out of short term long positions because of greed. What’s being done here in HISTORIC. By holding, you have them by the balls. They still believe greed will win. If it does, the price will go down quick and hard. BUT (IF) folks do next week what you did this week...(and that doesn’t mean a slew of new investors) they will bleed out and you name your price. Short % is still over 100%.DONT LET your GREED WIN because if you do, ironically, the hedge funds who’ve lived off greed will be saved"

We're clearly winning this guys. Be patient and just HOLD or BUY
It's a waiting game they have to cover
If gamestop has no value why did hedge funds short this to the tune of 12 billion?? They hated that company that much? They made up shares out of thin air to short 144% !!! Evil.
THIS IS MY NEW ADDICTION!! MY NEW HIGH! Whenever I buy I get a rush of adrenaline and it gets more and more addicting! GET HIGH WITH US AND BUY BUY BUY AND HOLDDDDDD ON FOR DEAR LIFE!!’ LETS DO THISSSS!!!!!
RH knows law makers are on to them...now they pulling back their #$%$ tactics.

"Class action against RobinHood officially announced. Friday was always predicted to be big because of short contracts dating then. This is the calm before the storm for the shorts, they need to be very afraid. For holders, this is a time to keep calm before the party."

"Volume is super low right now. Do not sell, as most people can not buy. They are artificially dropping the price."
"I hope that any person who owns GME shares that were purchased on Robinhood moves to another trading platform. This is unacceptable and Robinhood should lose customers because of this. Hope none of the spacs that I own are wanting to take Robinhood public! If I find out that Robinhood is their target, I will sell my shares in that spac! Also, I was able to pick up a few shares on Fidelity this morning. Hoping GME starts to climb again tomorrow now that all but Robinhood (I think) have lifted their ban on buying GME."
After hours spike coming. Hold on tightly
Today is the day the little guys broke wall street. Good luck to all the $GME out there
"NO WAY they can cover 100% of shares and over that impossible. Hold until we see action next week. Their shorts and ITM options calls will be scrambling which is why they throwing everything they got!!!!!!!! Im going to the gym to stay pumped!!!!!!!! WOW, AMAZING, HISTORIC!!!!!!!!!POWER TO THE PEOPLE!!!!"
They trying to keep this under 320 by end of day. Their Sell Ladder attacks are doing less and less.
"First of all you guys said the two hundred dollar option expired and we will sell it for four hundred and twenty dollars. Now you changed your mind and are saying the three hundred and twenty dollar option expired and that it will reach thousand dollars. That is making me think that you are using us to profit from us. Also, they are not hedge phones and are retailers and the hedge phones knows that it's temporary and can borrow money from anyone but regular retail investors can't because they will lose the money."
Headline should be robinhood costs retail investors millions.
REDDIT: 1000 isn?t even the ballpark for what this will be worth. DO NOT SELL AT 1000! We can push it to 5 figures if we HOLD. They literally HAVE to buy the shares back at whatever price we determine JUST HOLD INTO NEXT WEEKCopy and paste. We need everyone to HOLD. If everyone holds we decide the price. Don?t #$%$ out when it hits 1000 HOLD HOLD HOLD.GME TO THE #$%$ MOON

bought one share at 245 >
"What I've been saying at $NOK forums= im going to be brutally honest with everyone. Short squeezing has been a big play in the market that a lot of you guys didnt even research each stock. Currently GME has 226 short% of float, AMC at 38.12%, EXPR 13.5% and NOK at less than 1%. This means out of the float that is available, only that % of stocks are shorted or will be shorted therefore, the higher the %, more stocks will be shorted. Also $NOK 's put/call ratio (higher the ratio, means higher degree of shorting) is at 0.82 where $GME 2.78, $AMC 1.63, $EXPR 4.29. Like am I the bad guy trying to pull comrades out of a sinking ship? literally whole night of researching to find the best shorting stock to invest in for them and being called a bot hurts. what hurts more is this movement is going on its separate ways already :( Numbers and stats never lie though I hope yall research before investing into anything. (BTW im all in in AMC with 931 shares)"
Retail investors only allowed to sell and guys are wondering why it's down ? I never saw such manipulation
Don't listen to anyone saying sell...the squeeZe has yet to be squeezed..HOLD THE LINE...
"So, why isn’t anyone talking about LGND as the most obvious squeeze play? 10+_m short with 15+_m float?"
Bears and shorts go running for the hills in AH
I AM HOLDING STTONG ON BOTH $NAKD AND $GME. LET THE SHORTERS HAVE THEIR EMERGENCY OVER THE WEEKEND WHILST WE STAY STRONG. KEEP GOING HOLDERS!!
"$GME $AMC $BB $AAL I totally disagree with what these brokers have done to you all. Though I'm not surprised and i Did try and warn you they wouldn't just sit back and take it. I support a lawsuit, these companies should also be suing."
fully support the cause but remember people that you are still buying a cash burning brick and mortar video game store and thats all your shares represent. it is actually dangerous what is occurring here. i support the freedom to trade but we also have to realize that it will not go up forever and that people will actually want their money at some point and to do that you will have to sell
"Technically, I think the actual short squeeze ended on Monday or even last week, when major players were able to buy really cheap in really high quantities. But what is going on now is that people are being forced to keep buying at an extremely high price in much lesser quantities. This is not a short squeeze anymore, it is more of a suicide for those who have to buy. Simply holding is not going to help. You need to keep buying. It is very dangerous IMO. I have never heard of a short squeeze that could last for weeks. Maybe it is possible, but I doubt it. I guess we will find out on Monday,"
"Tonight is a full moon outside, sign we're going to the moon tomorrow"

mfw all hedge funds that shorted GME go bankrupt
Look at this.The hedge funds bought it down artificially to insert long position as a hedge to reduce losses
Do not sell your long positions. The hedge fund shorts cannot buy and cover if you do not sell. In any business you cannot buy anything if it is not for sale. Hold long and strong.
$GME $AMC Hedgefunds still shorting. Put them on their knees.  • Send this to 1000
"Copied from WSB MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKD It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.Edit: I am not a financial advisor and my reason for investing is that I just like the stocks :)"

Guys Take look at CPE low float and shorted heavily....very easy to squeeze shorts. This one is way undervalued at $14 ....was $45 pre pandemic when oil was at 45 but now oil is $54
Trading 212 allowing $AMC and $GME. Pick up a small position and HOLD till $500 
I am leaving RH with all my money and stocks today. They just make money and gives no shxx on their customers. Low reputation.
Now they are censoring our ability to buy stock. Welcome to communism 2021
Let's push this over $300!!!!
Now they are threatening purchasers of GameStop with a lawsuit. These people will stop at nothing!
It’s just price!! No volume decrease so DONT PANIC SELL!!!! They have to buy all this back tomorrow and that’s when the real squeeze starts!!
"Billionaire shorting investors and hedge fund managers have been manipulating stock prices for many years, while stealing the small ""retailer"" stock investors money. Example: Citron shorts millions of dollars worth of company ABC stock. Then they manipulate the stock price by publishing negative articles about the stock. Meanwhile the SEC, government and Wall Street turns a blind eye towards this insider trading technique due to these Wall Street lobbyist paying into political campaigns. - Yeah they are free to commit stock manipulation or any such financial crime. But when the small ""retail"" investors get together to hit back against the billionaire elite shorters, then these same elites go berserk. Like I said before, I feel sorry for the small ""retail"" investor losing $1000. I am happy when the billionaire elite, lowlifes such as Citron Research, the hedge fund managers, Soros, Andre Left, Gates, Zuckerberg, Buffett, Pelosi, Soros, and other such lowlifes lose a few billion. This is called ""redistribution of wealth"" and is a fundamental characteristic of a free marketplace and also communism."

550 million shares shorted. 8 million average volume. Do the math 75 days for all the shorts to cover. I will make $5 million off this mark my words
"Squad member Rashida Tlaib tweet: ""This is beyond absurd. @FSCDems need to have a hearing on Robinhood's market manipulation. They're blocking the ability to trade to protect Wall St. hedge funds, stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who've used the stock market as a casino for decades."""
They are doing their best to bring it down before close. Hold strong
"Watch $AMC, $GME and $GBR tomorrow. AMC and GME gained a lot AH, so it'll be something to watch for close to market opening. I'm expecting GME to make another run towards 400. Friday is gonna squeeze a lot more shorts out."
They have to buy more than 10 million shares to day. THEY HAVE TO. HOLD for a higher price!If it drops they trying again to scare you. They just increase there short position and doesnt change anything for us. We make a statement to the greedy hedge funds!
I like the stock!
$500 TOMORROW !
"I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29. I copied this comment so Copy and paste to educate the people!"
GME to 1000 tomorrow!!!!
500 open 1000 close tomorrow
you should all go to reddit RIGHT NOW. $PTN $XSPA $BB $GME
"I hope the short squeeze works as planned. I feel like there’s a good chance that the fund managers are sitting on massive long positions, with intentions of unloading tomorrow to drive the price down to close out their short positions. It will be interesting!"
"Here is what the media or politicians never mention to the public. They argue that 26.00 minimum wage increase will put many small business out of commission. Well they certainly have failed to give us the figure as to how many small businesses these hedge fund managers are responsible for filing bankruptcy due to them shorting those business stock prices so as to benefit. They cared not for the small struggling businesses. All they saw was an opportunity to exploit, along with the help of bigger conglomorate companies trying to establish monopolies, so as to control prices and bought out dishonest stock anaylysts working on these companies behalf, making subjective analytical assessments of those smaller companies as to why they were overvalued. These bought out analysts in know the full power of their recommendations and easily did a negative report of these smaller companies for a few, paid to them by those larger corporations that were trying to get rid of their competition."
Huge gains will be made tmrw

"We ought to be asking what the implications of BME are for the financial markets as a whole.I see few asking such critical questions.There are essentially two groups in this grand casino--the well heeled and the common man.The well heeled--the hedge funds--seem to impose their will over the little guys.It is one more wealth transfer from the masses to the elite.This has been the case for decades, but it has never been more blatant than in the case of BME.We also should not romanticize the little guy at the BME roulette table.His motives are the the same as that of the hedge funds--easy money and greed.One group merely has what the other desires--wealth without real work or production of utility.I suggest these type of events erode confidence in the financial markets.That is the most important lesson.Such an erosion of confidence can easily lead to a financial panic.Yes, a stock market crash."

"The short squeeze hasnt even started yet. Still 120% short interest. These hedgefunds need the borrowed shares by tomorrow! Buy, Buy, buy! Will open over $600 tomorrow."
DIAMOND HANDS
SHORTING Needs to go back to the Old Rules. For me to Short Sell Any stock. STOCK AB for example. there has to be an Uptick in price before the Order can be entered into the system !
"Looks like the big institutions win another round against the small guy. Thanks, Robinhood and all the brokerages who limited trading."
Citron is scared #@!$% to text out there shorting stock. Retail investors are armed $$$$$ and ready to pound on it.
is this what happens when they short more than the number of shares available to buy??squeeze them till they shart!!!
I bought at $400 what should i do?
Brandon the Dow is gonna fall bigtime with Dems in charge raising taxes to the skyyyy
every halt makes me hold my shares even tighter
"“$GME short interest is $11.20B; 57.83M shares shorted; 113.31% of Float; 53.12% S3 SI% Flt; 29% fee & easing. Shares shorted down -5.08M shares, worth $983 million, -8.07%, last week. Shorts down -$19.75B in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$7.83B on today's +70% move.”They havent even covered yet and the fees are only getting higher."
gme to replace USD as the world's reserve currency.
"There is a grace period for covering expired options, so this round may not play out until next week. If this rally continues beyond next week, that would be extremely bullish and create another potential explosion in price around Feb 15-25. My guess is that there will be a lot of turmoil, since many holders of calls may not have the capital to exercise them at these prices. It appears that not many option positions are being closed yet, which means there will be many stock calls exercised thru early next week. It is impossible to know what direction this takes for the next few weeks. Eventually, GME stock will crash, but it could take longer than many may expect."
If you bag holder truly believe people are buying and holding. You can calculate the volume of trade for the past week. It’s probably 6x the 70 million outstanding share the company has. Numbers don’t lie but people do!
"Looking Like GME Could Be Hitting $1500.00 Per Share Tomorrow Folks!(just look at a Bitcoin to understand how, or why, this can happen)"
im in with 5k at 335.80.... here to support the cause and make bank
So everyone understands how this works Monday is likely not the end. The end comes when either 1. The funds decide to close their short positions for a loss causing a short squeeze 2. They are forced to close their short positions based on margin requirements if and when the stock goes too high by whoever they borrowed the shares from or 3. Everyone gets scared and sells due to some kind of SEC announcement or something. A pop on Monday will likely only be from the ITM calls that expired this week. This may last for quite some time until you see the 1000% “gamma squeeze”. Just be sure if you’re riding it to have sell limit orders so you don’t get hosed and miss out on taking profits.
"WHY is anyone trading this stock instead of playing BINGO.?In the long run, BINGO is more profitable."
I don't think this is the type of reset the Globalists were hoping for.
very interesting and odd that $gme and $amc trend line today are almost the same. hmmm
HOLD!! 
Why are my comments getting deleted? Can I not express my enthusiasm for this stock?
All the people are with you GME investors BUY BUY hold CYDY
"One thing this is showing is how manipulated the market is. It's showing the lengths that Institutional money, media, brokers, etc go to with the intention of screwing retail investors.People are waking up."
The world is watching.. They thought getting on the news will fix the problem they created from their own greed.
"@everyone SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATEHedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK5,000+. ✦ ˚ * . . ✦ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ , . . ﾟ .  ., . . . . ✦ ,  , ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ . . ˚ , . . . * ✦ . . . .  . . ˚ ﾟ . .  ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ,"
"Shorting is nothing else than by SEC approved robbery...how can you sell my own company? Without buying first? What will be the next? you sell my bike? my car? My HOUSE????OK, if you like selling the that much stuff..and steal my money and others...what about selling METS??? Let us see when METS will be for sale...Regards from Europe..."
"And furthermore, with borrow costs now at 50%, even in the absence of further painful gains in the stock price the cost of carry alone will force the shorts to cover in the coming days should the price of GME fail to drop."
HOLD they’re trying to get you to sell
Support this cause!Even contributing 1 share is enough!!There is no need to go all in but come and contribute with the cash you EXPECT to lose. Then Diamond hands.THOSE HEDGE FUND FXXKERS WILL PAY.
People just buying your shares up for super cheap right now
"The GME TRAIN hasn’t left yet, Hop in people! "
"the only way to win here is to hold the stock for infinity so the price of the stock at the very least stay at current levels. however, they can hold their positions and not buy because they have no expiration time on their short positions. they could also sell new short at these higher prices"
The interest of the borrowed shares on the shorts is over 30%They will need to liquidate assets if we don’t give them any shares hahahahahaThey shorted more shares than exist! Let’s see them crumble starting Monday and beyond!
HOLD THE LINE!!!
"Note: for the record, a lot of hedge funds have gone long. I have little doubt Citron has gone long to recover their losses. Blackrock made a $2 billion profit. This is not just a small guy versus big guy battle. The math says longs are going to win the short squeeze war short term. Setting my sell at $990. I will take 300 percent return."
BUY THE DIP
V shape recovery
Very smart investors surely knew how this would end! Some of the greatest panic selling in history! Hahaha
GameStop short sellers are still not surrendering despite nearly $20 billion in losses this mont:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html

Easy Hold. Diamond Hands.Thank you for the low price so I can buy more.
Why wouldn't the mutual funds that own GME dump their shares at these prices ?
Does GME issue paper stock certificates? If so get the shares out of the broker's hands.
Almost blinked but my hands are tied. Surpassed the MM manipulation! See you on the other side.
"If you guys only just joined the WAR, THIS IS WHAT OUR GAME PLAN HAS BEEN: DON'T SELL ON INTRADAY CHANGES. WE WIN BY HOLDING PAST AFTER HRS.YOU BUY, CLOSE YOUR PHONE OR COMPUTER AND WAKE UP RICHER TOMORROW. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PRICE YOU GET IN, JUST BE IN.$BB $AMC $GME"
just bought 1000 shares of gme YOLO
It will take some time for people moving funds/accounts from unreliable/fraud broker platforms. Once new accounts are open and everyone start buying-it will double easy including short squeeze.
5k in at 335a little bit ago. im here to support the fight and make us all money. keep buying and holding!!!!! hold!!!! these borrowed shares will get paid back
ALL IN AND HOLING STRONG! Dont get manipulated. We are in the best position now!
"It may not mean nothing to y'all, Understand nothing was done for me, So i don't plan on stopping at all  $GME "
its a gift to sell now! somebody sold yesterday for 200$. when market opens we will say hello to 100$. WHY? because nobody will buy it for 400$. tell the truth
Short-selling plays an important role in ensuring that there is a balance in stock prices. It also helps to provide liquidity to the market. There's nothing morally unacceptable with short-selling as long as it is done legally
"Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to “tap” down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move"
Today you see a +1000% pop
LETS GOOOO
The short squeeze IS JUST getting started boys!! HOLD
"This is not about money now, this is about freedom, trading freedom and the dignity of being an individual investor."
"Wow, the CEO of Robinhood on CNBC right now appears to be stumbling around trying to explain why their customers were their not able to buy certain stocks today. The strangest thing is that no one on CNBC asked about individual investor losses in GME today when Robinhood prevented certain trading choices by their customers while, at the same time, Wall Street broker dealers were probably trading the GME with out restrictions."
Imagine Robinhood turning out to be cooperating with the sheriff of Nottingham....
why is there less volume than on average
"Halted for 15th time since this morning. Common Wall Street and trading platforms, seriously"
Not selling period!!!!
They are trying to stop as many brokers as they can from allowing $AMC $GME and others to be bought. But it was no problem for hedge funds to use 10x leverage to short shares of up to 140%CORRUPTION AT ITS HIGHEST
"The problem is that most of the ""Robinhood"" clients are holding fractional shares but there are hundreds of thousands of them. The few that were holding sizeable positions on ""Robinhood"" have already bailed out."
Watching regulators manipulate this stock was the biggest #$%$ to this so called free market! I usually stay away from speculative stocks but it?s no longer about the money!! It?s about the moral principle of knowing that the markets have been rigged and has always been rigged! To the moon or zero tomorrow ?????????
No restrictions in buying at all from here in Singapore
WE ARE COMING SHORTS
How about we start a mutual fund with all the stocks on the RH restricted list? I am looking for names to promote it? ;)
"When you ask Elon musk for real billions to support GME stock, his likely answer:-Look I love to but I don't have any money. I have to short my own Tesla stock to get loan and support my life.Totally truthful. So tell him he can also short his Tesla Stock and get loan and buy GME Stock. It's also ok he can then short his GME Stock , get loan and cover his Tesla Stock."
"When they make the movie about $GME GameStock, it should open only in $AMC theaters"
"Another good thing that will happen to INOVIO: Big Pharma & FDA have been ignoring and putting a damper on INO-4800. With the expectation of the short squeeze coming, all big media names CNBC, CNN, Fox will mention INO and Inovio will get free PR for INO-4800Unlike $GME or $AMC, $INO is a real GEM. $INO will explode and stay. Let say $300 in SPRemember, each needs to buy 100 shares on the open on Monday.GLTA!"
this is gonna be a fun week to come...DOW plummets 900% next week and we all get $$$$$$$
SENDING HELP FROM CANADA. I JUST BOUGHT MORE
Game is going up to $400. We are continuing to see the Main Street traders surpassing the wallstreet trader.
"if they restrict access to buy $GME and $AMC, then price will fall due lack of buyers! then again, if no one is allowed to buy, who the hack is gonna buy your shares if you want to sell it? SHORTS !!!!"
Now retail investors can only buy 1 share. Hold the line
Shorts will rather pay interest then cover at this price. No squeeze tomorrow
"Vanguard, Revolut, Charles Schwab, fidelity, Degiro, Wells Fargo and JPM (if you have a chase account) all allow free trades of $AMC and $GME WITH NO LIMIT. Copy and Paste to let people know"
You know EVERYONE ON THE PLANET will be buying this. Price will go to a gazzilion. BUY BUY BUY BUY and the BUY BUY BUY BUY
"REPOSTED FROM WSB Reddit also applies to AMCPLEASE SHARE THIS AROUND! TODAY IS A CRITICAL DAY! (Copied and pasted)The limit imposed by Robinhood and others on how many shares you can purchase (vs unlimited selling) will make things very hard for us. There is no guarantee that squeeze will happen today. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. Hedge funds are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation that Today is make-or-break for $GME so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DO NOT FALL FOR IT BECAUSE SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. It may be Friday or could be next week but for sure one day we will see the real squeeze. Until that time comes hold the #$%$ line.REMEMBER ENEMY IS NOT FIGHTING BACK BECAUSE WE ARE WEAK, BUT BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG. THEY KNOW THEY ARE LOSING THE BATTLE! AND NOW THEY FEAR US. THEY FEAR OUR BRAVENESS, FEARLESSNESS, HONESTY & MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ??> UNITY.WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S TODAY OR NEXT WEEK5,000+ ?????????"
dont sell!!! for once we have the upper hand!!!! they have to cove no matter how high it gets!!!
"If 30M shares need to be bought, either to cover direct shorts or call options ITM, and y'all hold those 30M shares: you need to not sell! They will be forced to buy those shares tomorrow to cover ITM calls! The issue is they might drop it after hours tomorrow as much as possible to make as many calls OTM as they can.You need to hold the line. Get AH trading capability. Now! Go. Hold that price up until 530ET tomorrow night. Or even better, 8PM.Most call writers probably went neutral today. So you might not break them. But you can still hurt them."
"Am i wrong by saying that this huge bubble could create another wave to short the stock? Just saying this because anything that is too high goes down somewhere in the timeline. Even if it goes to 1000$. One day, it will come back to its original price. Anyone in the middle of this war could be hurt..."
"Guys I like the stock so much I will not sell until $10,000. And even at that point, I will only sell half. The other half is going to be a trophy that I might sell for $100,000. Imagine if 500 million people worldwide buy just 1 share of GME. This is Bitcoin version 2021 folks."
The big boys are selling to eachother in hopes we sell but we got 
Let#$%$ this 500$ EOD!!!
We don’t need anyone to go all-in here. We just need everyone to buy roughly 1% of their portfolio and not sell. Keep holding until they start covering!
Almost no retail traders have access to after market. Ask yourself why the price gets to these levels. Look at what's been happening. Violent crashes. The exact people you are fighting are now winning. Keep giving your money away. All the companies being pumped have no value. The people getting rich are the owners and experienced traders. Well done. Keep making the riche even richer.What's hilarious is now they don't have to even work. They can do it by running unsuccessful companies thanks to a post and tweet.
"will this be at 1,000 Friday yes or no"
I’m with Robinhood where can I go to buy more?
it is not allowed to set sell order for higher mount than 10% I was told by my broker... WALL STREET IS ONE BIG FAIL!!!! Working illegally for illegal shorts...
HOLD THE LINE BOYS. WE GOING $1000+ NEXT WEEEEEEEEK. HISTORY WILL BE MADE.
So how long can Robinhood keep people from buying? Can't be indefinite.
Robin Hood is changing his ways. The one I grew up with took from the rich and gave to the poor. The new one is doing the exact opposite.
margin call soon?
Wall Street promised to cover any lawsuits coming the way of eToro and Robinhood. They both get $50 million dollar bonus for their co-operation.
Steve Cohen Mets deleted his twitter account 
You need to buy on the dip and not after the shorts cover! Stop chasing the momentum and be the momentum!! $BBBY $AMC $NOK $SKT $TR $KOSS $GME
GME guys please help AMC movement too
We holding over the weekend.??
ok I just jumped in for 20 shares...I heard on Bloomberg Hedge funds cannot come up with enough shares to cover!!!! We're now talking unlimited rise in price.
does this end today or is this continuing into next week
you are buying at the expense of the rest of the retail market not just hedge funds. Tell yourselfs what u want but go look at the rest of the market. My nabour 60 years old lost his retirement job well done boys. All shorts are pulling postions in companies many people rely on.
ROBINHOOD AND AMERITRADE SIDED WITH THE RICH AND WALL STREET. CLOSE THERE ACCOUNT AND MAKE THEIR BUSINESS SUFFER THE LOSS
Hold!!!!!!!’
Try and help $AMC too
DOW is UP this stock will crash at open DO NOT BE AFraid DO NOT SELL
Can somebody please explain to me why they expect this to go up tomorrow and how the options have an effect on the price. I would really appreciate it.
"I don't understand the message here. GME was a $2.00 stock that popped to $20.00. Great move. Hedge funds caught short. WSB formulated a great plan after observing the massive short interest and realizing there were not enough shares available for the shorts to purchase.But... the stock priced popped to over $400. WSB and people on this site are still pumping GME. How is this ethical. Do you really want novice investors to purchase at these levels and get stuck holding the bag? It's a great movement, but at some point, you have to realize you already won. Don't be complicit in a Ponzi Scheme. Very curious if the SEC goes after WSB."
We show them our power as We
5 of the 7 major brokers have blocked GME trading. Yet we're still up.
Not selling a single share 
"Hold everybody, hold the line!"
I would not be going to sleep if I was short this stock - WSB added 3 million user last 24 hours or so - It is becoming international - Bank on it - if it hits 500 omg- few firms are going bankrupt - Robbin hood is done kaput- Baba says Bohica!!! Bent over here it comes again el govapo!
We're in the final stretch boys
"Look at the VW chart from 2008 during the squeeze! This is it, hold on to your tendies because the next stop is Mars!"
Hello $300! Can it get to $400 AH??
"It's this simple folks, ""the little investor"" now has Walls Street Market Maker Hedge Fund Rich Elites by their littleBallsacks because of the sheer NUMBER of these ""little investors"" who are ""together"" in this endevour. This has never happened before, wall street knows they're in big big trouble here, and as a long time investor myself, I definitely concur with that assessment, Wall Street is the BEGGAR in this situation big time, and they're going to get wrecked on this. Problem is, GME is only one of MANY stocks with massive short shares outstanding, a small float, and will also explode and trap these shorts in 2 seconds if this ""same gang of small investors"" decides to start another one. You know this is going to ""catch on rapidly"" in the young generation as it will circle into their social media and tech groups FAST. This is going to wreck wall street, it could collapse it eventually as more stocks experience this GME ""war"" effect against hedge fund elites. I love it because it will bleed into their coastal real estate holdings as they have to sell to free up margin call demands. This is huge folks! Take GME to $5000 and then do another one right away! Then more of them, and it will snowball fast with Wall Street elites being the massive losers. It will change the entire financial playing field imo by taking loads of the elites wealth and redistributing it to these ""little investors""."
"Again the squeeze hasn’t even started. Whatever you do, do not sell. This will be worth multiple thousands of dollars per share starting next week. If you own 1 share or 100 shares, you will be paid easily 4 digits per share once they begin to cover next week."
"I'm just interested to observe what trick the authorities will come up with this time to save the big boys from ruin. You've read about the great Piggly Wiggly short squeeze, right? It's a noble fight, but so far the casino has always found a way to win."
HOLD THE LINE
"Andrew L no longer shorts stocks - why? It’s way easier to rally Joe Sixpack muppets to buy stocks than to short them, it’s easy to rally an army of muppets to long any stock which will make your hedge fund 100s of millions"

"This is going up anyway, don't get scared, with all the shares they have to cover there's no way this is going down more than this for now. I'm pretty sure we will see the $300-400 again, and probably more."
"If tomorrow opens at $150, you are lucky"
It will be great upwards today when shorts will beaten. Huge upside. Can be above $100 soon. Marketcap only $80M. Waiting as $GME or $AMC jump
Why are the financial business news shills so worried about a relatively small cap company like GME?
there going to try EVERYTHING. get ready to buy the dips. NO ONE WHO BOUGHT THE PEAK GETS LEFT BEHIND. 
750 after hours?
It was amazing to see how small traders can join forces on the internet and drive prices like billionaires hedge funds. but aventually it is just a game and a dangerous one.

"Read this if your scared. We will go up again before the day is over!!MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKD It’s unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it’s not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.Edit: I am not a financial advisor and my reason for investing is that I just like the stocks :)"

where can I see how many short calls are out there rn?
Don’t forget tomorrow you can be in a different trading platform !
as soon as it makes financial sense dump robinhood and ken griffin and move to a platform that didn't collude to rob their clients for the hedge funds!
$GME is not done. People should be in prison for restricting the trading of retail investors. $LXXGF is next. Big short position and pending EUA getting announced in April. $LXXGF prime for the taking.
Do not sell !
Heading back up
"Yesterday's Robinhood betrayal caught everyone off guard. They did it again today but the effect wasn't nearly as severe. We did quite well today, actually. Closed $325 and all call options up to $320 strike expired ITM! Next week as more people switch to a credible broker that actually lets them buy stocks, Robinhood's buying restrictions won't even put a dent in the GME rocket. They've showed their hand. Going into next week, we're fully expecting Robinhood to do everything in their power to crash this stock. Unfortunately for them, they wont be as successful next time."
take a step back and think. do you really think this is caused by you? hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars moving caused by people on reddit and youtube? be careful lol.
2 shares sell order at 1k
Can anyone answer what is stopping from the rulers to meet with GME board and tell them its in everyones best interest for you to accept this offer to take the company private $50 or to issue 100m shares at $50. I have seen a couple deals happen in the past where the buy out price was below the current market price.
Imagine selling lmao
Is RH going to allow GME buys tomorrow?
Believe can closed around 400 and going bigger next week! But only can add 5 shares to support!

"Tomorrow the real battle begins into next week.. with options expiring the funds will do anything and everything to push it down, we saw that today. I've held through every short attack, every dip and every rise. All eyes will be on GME tomorrow and it wouldn't surprise me if they try something right in front of our eyes. They have no moral compass because they face no consequences. I hope they go to jail but I know they won't, they're in with the corrupt politicians. I will still be holding if GME hits $15 a share because they deserve to lose it all after everyone they have financially ruined (probably someone you know). Remember 08 and remember the share dumping before the 2020 crash. They fully deserve what is coming."
BEARS GEY
"The SEC are like Refs in a football game....they are charged to enforce the rules. I see at least a couple dozen rules that THEY broke today by banning free trade and allowing only ONE-SIDED trading! The SEC should be sued by every state attorney and this should be brought ultimately to the Supreme Court for a ruling. Enough is enough! The stock market SHOULD AND MUST be a level playing field. If it's fair for the insiders and hedge funds, they have no right to complain when the sheet is shoveled back their way!"
WE ARE FIREMAN WE LIVE IN THE HEAT
Yes look where we are at after hr...imagine with no interference it would of triple during the day
GOOOOOOOOOOO power hour
To the moon. What wallstreet did to GME and other stocks was clearly illegal.
Since 12:11 PM the intraday chart looks remarkably ordinary until you realize the trading range is still 206 up to 300 and a number of those one minute candles are 6% moves...
HEDGIES RIGHT NOW
Its all over the news the hedge funds are on the losing hands as long as you hold! They know this so they trying to not let you buy and only wants you to sell! Smart traders will hold and the dip will only invite new traders to come in and ride
i joined the revolution feels good
Watching this battle (from the sidelines) is the most fun I’ve had in years! Keep it going!!!
"Much respect for not folding GME, hedgies are flushing the market down the toilet to get you to sell."

"I think today is going to be most volatile. I ask people to take profit when go up and buy back when go significant lower. I am at signficant risk but I can bet on this big boy that big game will played. They facing lot of limitation on how much extreme they go to avoid backlash..My prediction range like 250 - 400.If they didnt shut down trading for retail, this could gone 1000 like many were predicting. I didn't believe in their story but yesterday shutdown sure was clear cut proof."
"Keep sale orders at 10,000."
"all here is about HOLDING. if you start selling your shares, they are waiting to cover. if you HOLD they have no choice but buy from the right side. this situation is one in 30 years!!!! HISTORIC. they completely know it. HOLD TOGETHER guys"
Guys $CPE is a sure bet from $14 to $45 by year end even without shot squeeze ... but if we can squeeze 9-10 mm shares shorted it will fly cause it has almost entire float shorted...
They tried so hard to bring us down today and failed. Continue to hold and wait for the squeeze to happen!
power hour rtards!!!

"Kind of crazy. So if the 1% loses money on a short bet to small time retail investors, literally all of Wall Street will bend the rules so that the corporations and hedge funds win and the retail investors lose.

Everyone needs to read posts on wallstreetbets for info. Don’t just read these comments.
"According to some pundits; the shorts are try to sit out and playing a waiting game, they are waiting for the stock to go down before the recuperate the shares they needed. It’s a game of chicken who will yield first. In the meantime they are paying the fees and interest which is a lot cheaper then trying to recuperate for now. So fellow investors...., hold strong!!!!"
I heard Andrew Left and Steve A Cohen are very upset with the Retail (us) investors.
This is NOT fair...isnt this a crime to manipulate market?
"After many of you lose your investment, I hope you remain interested and seek an education and possibly a profession in economics, finance and investment. Don't let the burn that too many of you are going to get discourage you. There's actually a very intelligent and sensible way to invest and you may find you like learning about how the economy and markets actually work."
"The most likely scenario is the government gets GME to authorize 30 million shares by Monday morning and they get $3 billion in return (PPE type funds). Hopefully they ask for more, $5 billion would keep GME at around $250."
"Robinhood exercised forced sells for many users, some didn’t have margin at all. That’s totally illegal. Just submitted my demand to close robinhood. If you believe in free market, you should close your account too ... and probably buy gme today"

"The start-up trading app Robinhood invoked Occupy as it promised to fix a ""rigged"" financial system. But the firm now faces class action lawsuits for scamming its millions of novice customers — showing that ""democratizing"" finance is just a way of finding more people to prey on."
"Today is going to be a hard day. We thought they were desperate yesterday? I don't even know what they'll do today. My humble advice:1- remove stop losses, they're automatically triggered in halts2- have a clear exit plan you are comfortable with3- if your here until next week just look away today (me)GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONEWe will be remembered in history "

It's unfortunate that the bubble popping will be blamed on the Reddit movement. What other way does the story go?

"Seems like the shorts and hedge funds are realizing, that they are on the wrong side of history.... Again, and are afraid that they will not get bailed out on the same terms, as they did in 2008. Im already excited for the movie that will be made about the resent events.."
"3) more to follow. See posts by me below. Now it's a classic million-player prisoner's dilemma: every GME holder has visions of selling their shares for unlimited chicken tendies and cocaine dipping sauce. Maybe they think they alone can sell, while everyone else can continue to drive the price up by holding. But if every degenerate gambler thought this way, and sold their shares, very quickly the short squeeze wouldn't happen. Short holders would buy up all the shares being sold at a painful but manageable loss, they would cover their position, and the nuke would never be detonated.What's a prisoner in this dilemma to do? At last, the point arrives. To avoid selling too early, the savvy degenerate gambler would wait until short interest - the amount of shares shorted out there - started to decline substantially. As long as nobody was defecting, nobody selling early, that decline in shares shorted would come with a spike in the price of the stock, as the few shares available are bought at astronomical prices. And this decline in shares shorted would distinguish this spike from gamma squeezes or regular old stock run-ups.Then and only then, as the nuke goes off, the stock price ascends past Alpha Centauri, and the short interest finally starts declining, the short squeeze has begun. And then it's every gambler for themself."

"$NIO $AMC $GME $NAKD $NOKMonths back, when Citron spread false info about NIO causing SP to plummet, I remember everyone scratching their heads asking themselves ""How is this even legal?"", and thought nothing could be done. I guess we were wrong.Classic case of wealth inequality where ""In 2011, financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 43%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%""Think about it. Now the tables have turned. Before it was always the small population who controlled most ASSETS that controlled the system, but now the it's the larger percentage number of the POPULATION who is fighting back and can implement change through strength in numbers.Being a Gen-Xer, I've learned to never underestimate the millennials and younger generations who know the internet way better and can outsmart the system.

"Copy paste from @BrausUK on twitter: ""WHY $GME, $BB and $AMC ARE DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off.

"GME was supposed to go to $1000 today. Robin the hood ruined it all. Once they are forced to let buyers buy again, we go again  to $1000 baby"
"Listen well. This is what they are doing: They are doing everything they can to buy as many shares to cover as they can via halts, bans, media hype, they are trying to get politics involved. They are doing a ladder cover because they know they will have to pay a very high premium at least a 1000 when the squeeze starts. This way, they are reducing the number of shared they will have to cover at the highest price. Basically, they are averaging loss. This is what they always do, this is no different. When the squeeze starts, this will skyrocket, everyone knows it. They are just shaving off their losses. So, KEEP CALM & HOLD."
"Am I still allowed to use the word ""TRANSPARENCY"" ?If so that is what I want of this market.And to be fair, I do like this stock."
"Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying. Short positions have went up here drastically which means they are banking on a crash but if you as an individual investor, hold together with many other like minded investors.. we can not lose. Keep fighting the good fight. Cheers. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC and many more."
"GameStop remained the most shorted name in the market right now as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said."

"It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.Deep#$%$ingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen."
The think they can invade Discord and Reddit with plants. We invaded the short and distort circle.THE BIG SQUEEZE WILL BEGIN IN 5 BUSINESS DAYS. But what do I know? This is no way investment advice. I just like the stock and I'm holding.

To all bears You are right this is overvalued and garbage But at the end of the day This is no longer investing It’s a message to Wall Street that the game is finally changing they are not the only ones that have to power to move stocks We are doing what 2008 couldn’t do bankrupt those who should have lost it all
I love $GME $NOK $BB $INO $AMC
"Congrats to all the new millionaires! To all the brothers and sister who bought high, hang on we are coming for you"
Dont take that loss. You can make 500 a share after that short attack. They have to buy back!!
If we run it up over 320 at close we are squeezing hard. Keep it up!!’ This means everything !
"it seems as if gme wants to run to all time new highs once again folks.like i said before, if a tesla, with no value left in the stock, can go from the high $900.00's then split 5 for 1 and go to the high $800.00's all in about a years time, then anything can happen.also bitcoin, something worth absolutely nothing, can go to just below $42,000.00 there is something extremely wrong going on.my guess is the ""it's algos all the way down"" now folks!a very happy weekend to all!"
"Unlikely someone is selling. This is a short ladder and looks like the stock is selling off when in fact it isn’t. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there isn’t one.When attack is over the stock will normally go back up due to its demand and then they will repeat the same attack hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. All we need to do is hold. That easy!"
"it's happening, we are making history"

"?Short Interest is reported by the exchanges on semi-monthly basis for stocks that trade with the NYSE. The most recent report was short interest as of Jan 15 which is 226.42% of shares float increased from Dec-31 of 140%. This is because shares can be shorted more than once. - https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GMEToday, 9,606,123 new shorts were entered. It's not completely evident how many were covered but some paid services provide live estimates/data of current short interest. The short volume was in line with Tuesday's percentage of 16.89%. That is out of 58,494,600 shares exchanged today, 16.89% were shares that were shorted (sold on margin). This indicates an increasing short interest not decreasing. - https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme.The days to cover is really just an estimate of how quickly all the shorts could cover their positions by taking the short interest (number of shares shorted) by the average daily volume. Because the volume has been increasing higher for GME this makes it seem like the ""days to cover"" - 2.81 may seem like the short position is declining but it actually indicates the opposite. I would expect this to be less than 1 when the short squeeze is underway (e.g. less short interest / average volume). - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp. This number is extremely high vs TSLA with a ratio of 1.09 or AAPL 0.88. This high number represents that the short squeeze is ready to hit at any moment but we are far from there.At this point, the shorts think this is a fad and it will just fade away and so just keep re-entering to not only cover their loss but to earn profit off it's rise. They view that they haven't lost anything that can't be re-earned and aren't afraid of WSB army. Any fake news that say all shorts have exited is completely and 100% false.In reality, the days to cover will actually be much more because shares have been shorted more than twice. A position to close takes 2 days. So at most, only half of the short positions could be submitted for close in a given day and then it would require 2 days for those shares to be returned to their rightful owners at which point the 100% of the 120% would be able to exit requiring another 2 days to settle leaving 20% short interest. The second half of the short will be totally and utterly #$%$While I'm sure many tried to exit today at the drop of $125 if they shorted yesterday and many probably entered at today's high, it's clear that more has been entered via a ladder strategy - 100 shares @ $250, 100 shares @ $240, etc. dropping the price instantaneously but while this is intended to create fear it just exposed risk even more. So the shorts that were entered < $250 are now really screwed and either have to keep putting up more and more margin or cover their position.I wouldn't be surprised if this continues well into next week or the week after. Wall Street has deep pockets and when the stock rises 100% - 300% in 1 day (e.g. like AMC and GMC), someone has to pony up that money to ensure the short position can actually be covered and if the people who borrowed the margin can't, the clearing firms members (the brokers) have to (hence why RH and WeBull had to halt trading because it became so expensive to the shorts that they, the brokers, were becoming liable).This momentum took off way faster and higher than anyone could have imagined going up over 10x in 5 days (from last Friday to today's high).I think for this to continue, it will have to have more modest consistent gains, 20-30% per day, because 100%+ jumps creates massive margin calls that the shorts can't fund quickly and so the trades at are risk of settling meaning the brokers have to be deep pocketed enough to cover the greedy suits.If large jumps continue, trading will halt again. The margin requirements should be increased to 300-400% for any new positions and I think some are doing this but it appears that RH and WeBull's clearing house was exposed to a lot of risk of the suits not being able to cover such quick increases over night literally.?"
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? Can someone please explain!?!!
Who ready for some AH Mania...
I have just bought another 100 shares

"Ape into GME right now - sell anything else, even AMC or BB.320 is the key level for the gamma squeeze (350 would give us more fuel, but 320 could literally trigger the MOASS)Notice those quick ladder sells above 320?They cannot afford to close above 320.Build walls and market buy and hold.Why? Cause a close above 320 will require about 7,000,000 shares for ze options. Squoze would come.It has to be at 4pm and not after hours."

LETS GET TO THE MOON 
CLOSE ALL ACCOUNTS FOR INTERACTIVE BROKER AND ROBINHOOD
"They have to buy, you don't have to sell, so you set the price. Not them."
wow it's still holding up...
aoc is buying
"“People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they’re the ones getting hurt. American workers have known for years the Wall Street system is broken – they’ve been paying the price. It’s time for the SEC and Congress to make the economy work for everyone not just Wall Street. That’s why, as incoming Chair of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee I plan to hold a hearing to do that important workNow that congress is involved its game over CNBC has reported Robinhood has called JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs for an increased line of Credit to cover their Call and Put Bets They are going under the entire market is going to collapse"
"We as a nation have lost the plot! The stock market has become a momentum driven frenzy, with no relevance to the real economy! Interest rates around the world at zero! Printed money flooding the markets! Can’t allow tech stocks to drop...What happened to normal interest rates where people could plan their future accordingly, and not depend on stampede of stock market! Why not just run Tesla to 1000$ and short Ford to 2$ ? Come on Wall Street, you can do it!!!"
"I can't but in PM buy once markets open i have available cash & WILL be buying loads & holding.Investors do not believe these funds, they lie & have not closed their short positions & now they will be short selling more.Hold your nerve & HOLD GME, DO NOT SELL. Make these funds bleed money & hopefully bankrupt all of them"
"Lol this ain’t even close to the ending, this is just the beginning"
"EVERYBODY LISTEN UP-Shorts are BLEEDING. They ran out of bullets today trying to bring this down to $10 but even with the buying option being down, WE HELD THE LINE. We are moving from a short squeeze to a gamma squeeze with INFINITE possibility of profit. HOLD THE LINE SOLDIERS"
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7qahx/gme_squeeze/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Get it up to $320!
"It is just fake volume shortselling and buying it back by the same hedge funds! dont get tricked into this. They have to cover so many short positions, everyone of us can get his share sold at 1000!"
"this finance manipulation is making it easy for short sellers to profit when the trade is only for sellers and against any buyers. this is only hurting the retail investors because this is a force that is not within anyone's control but the brokers. we need to support the congress looking after this unfair disruption of the free market. wall street can not decide what or how we want to use our money. the institutions got bailed out in 2008 and not the people. today, they want to make more money from retail investors who are going through tough time in a pandemic. this is why WSB exists. it's about having an even ground between small and big investors. $GME $BB $SNDL $NAKD $NOK"
"Right now, options, call put strike up to 650 available for Jan 29 expiry. Wonderful."
officially joined the GME family. I didn't get a crazy amount by any means but I'm buying the dip and holding till triple digits. send some love over to AMC!we cannot let them get away with the blatant market manipulation
This is the same thing the hedge funds did before. They are selling rapidly back and forth between each other manipulating the algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off. Short ladder attack. Don’t be scared. Buy and hold.
"Wake up... another Buffet wrote this ""Come Monday it will be alright..""Which one is Wright? Mis spelled right for the robinhoods that need to come to adult world of trading sites. I do not represent any of them.Just truth it words of wisdom."
AFTERHOURS AKWAYS LIKE THIS WE DID IT AND NOW WE HOLD AND WIN NEXT WEEK
"First of All I Believe it is #$%$ What was done to STOP The Squeeze That was going Great for The GROUPS and then have The Online Brokerages Collude with The Shorts to Allow Them to Cover and Close Out Their Positions Yesterday & only Allowing People to Sell & not Buy. This should have been left to Run Its Course Out and Instead it was Halted Because The Shorts were Loosing Money all of the Sudden They get The Rules to Change to Work in Their Favor and Now This Squeeze that was So Masterfully Set Up is Done and it?s a Total shame That Robin Hood and Other Brokerages that were Allowing To Buy The Day Before Shut It Down and Set The Cover at $500 so now WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN? I say Never Again and Time to get a New Online Brokerage that Will Let You Trade....... I see that Fake Brokerage Robin Hood is not allowing CryptoCurrencies to Trade.... LOL! You can?t make stuff like this up. Now that The Shorts or The Vast Majority have Covered Their Positions I will say WATCH OUT because They are going to Use this to Short GME up here and watch..... in the End Most Will be making More Money Off The Short then They ever lost in Round 1 which was Rigged. I know The Markets INSIDE-OUT with 30+ Years of Experience and will Say I never liked The Ability of ANYONE to Sell Something They Do Not Own......... If it?s TRUE That The PLAN was to Get a Spotlight On Shorting And The Manipulation and Nothing to do with Making Money YOU ALL DID IT!!!! I do know Several have made some Serious Gains in the Process So GREAT JOB!!! I am so Happy That The Groups have Put This Shorting in The News and Everyone is talking about it now and Regulators are Looking........ Hopefully, some GOOD CHANGES WILL COME OUT OF THIS!!!Congratulations on a Job Well Done and if Some of You Made Money in The Process an Extra Congratulations to That Group Also in the Face of Exposing The ?Short Manipulation and The Connections To Certain Brokerages!!!. Hopefully Some People will go to Jail Over This and These Shady Brokerages that are in Bed With The Hedge Funds will go to Jail and also Get Good Younger Investors into Quality Trading Platforms where Your Trades are Not Used Against You. This is so complicated and that?s a Big Reason Why This hasn?t been Looked at in The Past..... So a MAJOR THANK YOU TO THE NEW YOUNGER INVESTORS THAT HAVE DONE A JOB WELL DONE!!!"
"Transferred all my money but $5 out of Robinhood today, for two main reasons, not because of this stock! No market orders on options, and no short selling! If l can't sell my options when I want at any price! Been stuck before in a fast moving market, because the weasel options dealers won't let you out on the ask or bid! they move them up and down! #$%$ that! Putting all this money back into TD Ameritrade with my other money that's there right now! Never did like the Robinhood screen layout or restrictions!"
"Naive traders who think they can time the top, you're wrong. Those who think the SEC isn't going to step in to protect the stability of the stock market an the financial system, you're wrong. Get out while you can, it's not going to end well."
I just called customer support at GameStop and they told me to HOLD!
omg look at the volume!! WE HELD!!!!
Today we made a STATEMENT........tomorrow we will finish the SENTENCE !!!
Robinhood and TD Ameritrade don't let traders trade from 4am to 7am while hedge funds can load up or sell. This is how they keep you down.
"I guess , this is retail investors and more short covering right now .. watch when RH comes online tomorrow!!! Everyone wants to buy !!! Tomorrow will be epic in history !! Once in a lifetime phenomenon!!!!!!"
Robinhood will lose a lot of customers.
Would you still buy at $300/share?
"Any of you figure out yet there is no $1,000 price today? you're just going to make the hedge funds richer"
"the situation (1/29 10 AM ET):short interest: 75.54% of float by Ortex, 113.31% of float by S3 Shortsightshort share public availability: 0Shorts are exiting their positions, but an amount of shares equal or almost equal to float is still shorted."
Are we hitting 400 or not?!
"I wish we supported GameStop business like we do their stock. If we the people allow GameStop to go down, then we have failed GameStop! #savegamestop"
BUY THE DIP AND HOLD! No paper hands allowed 
GAMESTOP STILL SHORTED 120% FRiday GME to 1000! AMC to 50!
Look at how low the sell volume is. This is being manipulated down. No one is selling their shares.THIS IS EXTREMLY BULLISH. KEEP IT ABOVE 200 MY FRIENDS. TO MARS
after this incident....we need to reassess robin hood. If they block retails folks because they are winning may be robin hood is not a right platform for us to trade on.
Do y’all not see what’s happening? Brokers won’t allow people to buy and then short sellers dump all at once to rank the stock. Having diamond hands  is not for the weak. Not selling a single share of either $GME or $AMC.. I’m here till the end because our voices have been heard and I wanna know how this all comes out. Good luck to everyone!
"today its sell day and First hours its sell time, and GME ITS HOLDING THE LINE! I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT ! HOLD!"
"Well that didn't work. Now we're all #$%$ RobinHood and others may have went down but we still held the line without them, and now there's going to be an influx of them coming back in, as 1/29 calls expire tomorrow. Also, WSB doubled in size on Reddit from 2.5 to 5 million people while they were locked out, and the injustice is causing big names to start supporting us on social media. Talk about backfiring for the shorters. The best part is the shorters didn't even cover when they managed to knock us down to $120, because they are just so arrogant in their certainty that we're all mindless sheep. Tomorrow is gonna be awesome!"
today it have to be over $600
"Notice how RH doesn't specify what it means to allow only ""limited"" trading tomorrow.Buying will dry up and as it falls there will be no one to sell your shares to."
"The charts today are following the same pattern the charts did, before it exploded the first time. Which closely resembled the same pattern #BB charts before they made the jump. Wake up people. It's a game they've been playing for years. Time to break the game."
"Sold remaining $AMZN share and will be YOLOing on $NOK, $BB, $ERIC next week. Not selling my $GME, $AMC until after the gamma squeeze. Let's go 5G!!!"
Restrictions being removed.
How many bought at $480.00 today?......56 million volume (Holy Mother Of Venus)What the Helly.......= ^ . . ^ =
Let's teach a lesson to RH and Hedge funds. $AMC 200 $GME 1000
"Silver short squeeze will be epic. 1 COMEX CONTRACT = 5,000 OZ of UNOBTAINIUM"
Prepare for lunch
Look at VW Chart. It is their last attempt of not getting squeezed ! Hold and already check for the colour of your new lambo
SEC should have halted all trading and have the shorters cover funds. Brokers did it but only on the retail side buying. Someones going to prison. The Wall Street insiders are still figuring out who will be the fall guy
DOUBLE IT!!! I love you really DO!!!
After hours will be the real test since there won’t be any halts.
THEY HAVE TO PAY WHATEVER THE PRICE FOR THESE SHARES. LITERAL INFINITE LOSS. HOLD FOR WAY WAY WAY PAST $1000
"WEBULL UPDATE: GME, AMC, and KOSS are no longer restricted."
"There are 113% of shares shorted right now. How can they cover 113% of shares when there is only 100% available? If everyone sets their sell limits to $2500 a shares, then aren't they forced to cover at that price? How are these ""retail investors"" going to lose?"
there is not enough shares for all of them to COVER.. if they allowed to short too many shares it's their fault. Institutions will pay HEAVY price.this is HISTORIC
"HOLD TOUR SHARES!!! THE HEDGIES WILL HAVE TO PAY WHATEVER WE ASK, THE COMPANY IS STILL SHORTED 140%"
Why #AMC is going down right now: So the HOLDING with #GME has been going on longer than #AMC. AMCs main SHORTS run out NEXT WEEK. Most of GameStop’s run out tomorrow. This is VERY IMPORTANT to understand! #AMC - DO NOT SELLPLEASE SHARE!! DONT MISS OUT ON #AMC
RH is partly owned by Melvin Citidale
EVERYONE BUY 2 SHARES JUST BEFORE THE CLOSE......LET'S MAKE HISTORY!
"Vlad Tenev CEO of Robinhood limit trading of GME by limiting buying but ok to sell. Said on CNBC they have capital requirements by SEC. What that means is when GME trade so high, Robinhood needs to raise cash requirement. When you trade on a small time platform, you risk this type of restriction. They don't have the rewuirements"
SeekingAlpha: $INO is heading to a short squeeze... just like $GME
At 2PM
SHORT LADDER ATTACK
Short sellers took an assumed risk in this free market economy. Brokerages can't restrict buying tmw. They're already in big trouble now.
"Nothing changed. Robinhood still is in sell-only mode. The ""limited buying"" promise was a gross exaggeration - a joke. ""When trading opened earlier today, users were limited to owning five shares of GameStop in aggregate, meaning they could only own up to five — if they already had three GameStop stocks, they could only buy two more — but even that restriction hasn’t lasted. Soon, the number of shares you could buy in GME dropped to two and then finally down to a single share. If you own a single share of GameStop stock, you can’t buy any more from Robinhood right now. "" https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"
When RH goes away where should i move my shares?
"HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD IT will happen.SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATEHedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN TODAY.It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.IF WE ARE PATIENT WE WILL BE PAID!!!"
Dear shorts: we already know the game. Your scare tactics are not going to work. Tomorrow is a day of reckoning
The MM crashed AMC to make an example and now are trying to scare you out of GME. The difference is that GME is way over shorted and has no choice but to rocket to the moon tomorrow. HOLD
Check your cash balances on Robinhood. My balance went down w/o any purchases this morning. WHat the duck they are after now? $Amc $koss $gme
"i put my stoploss for gme at $10,000"
Thunder cats hoooold
Trading 1 share at a time? Come over to SAVA where the squeeze is just beginning!
"Not about money its about Teaching a lesson, i ve lost alot more then them, whats a few coppers more..."
"All Hedge Funds have killed a lot of retail investors by selling short ta making tons of money. I wish some hedge funds should have filing bankruptcy. Retail investors buying stocks with their hoping stocks will rise, but hedge funds always trying to push stocks down. A very good lesson to them !"
This is pure and simple collusion between brokers and hedgefunds. Why would anyone continue to trade on Robinhood after this clear betrayal of their retail user base.
gamestop just finished phase 3 studies of covid vaccine. Sorry. wrong board. lol
Shorts
Yes! Guys $GME $AMC $KOSS $SNDL $BB $BBY - $TRIT is the real goal now !
GME UNDERVALUED IMO
The dawn is here. Hold your gold!
"The gvt, sec, and fed reserve rig the market so the serfs can't win and then blame it on the serfs for buying the wrong stock! See how free and fair and just america really is!!!??Fact!"
"BlackRock, has a 13% GameStop stake that is now worth more than $4 billion, compared with $174 million at the end of December."
"I bought a few stocks at $300, I don't care lose it, just to support you all."
this is exactly the pattern VW took wfore massive short squeeze. I predict sometime next week this soars past $1000
It’s not about money it’s about making a point. Hold
Im still not selling 1 share. If anything im buying more. Not letting these hedge funds scare us
I'm not in it.. But this is history folks your realise it?
"The 99% against the 1%. This is a movement. If we stay strong, we win."
"""Yes Son. ...and that's how Gamestop broke the brokers. The End. Now go to sleep."
"question; why dont shorts fully cover and just give up, why so stubborn..or they think retail cant keep the fight for long?"
HOLD!!!!!!
Merlin Capital can finally close its positions after giving a sweetheart deal to Robinhood to stop retail from buying the stocks
"over 100 Million shares will need to be purchased by close of business tomorrow if the Price holds above 200. Thats the volume of in the money Call options with strikes below 200. If it holds above 300 we are looking at in excess of 20 Billion in losses for the Hedgies that sold these naked calls. GME AMC BB are not going to the moon, they are going to pass the oort cloud on their way to the neutral zone then into romulan space. Hold on to your peens with your diamond hands"
its funny how no matter how hard they try shorts cannot keep this stock down lol
Lol read the interest rate on the borrowed shares they shorted that don’t existHold and it’ll just get worse for them. Lambos anyone? 
$AMC $BB $GME $NOK. THEY WANT US TO SELL ! HOLD HOLD HOLD
Just keep it above 300 and your golden
"Ok, yesterday I was skeptical and only watching today Im buying in Frankfurt. Lynx does allow to buy there but not in Nyse..."
"Nokia, Nokia, Nokia. Ticker NOK. If you might want a chance to run up that looks like the one based on the HUGE volume today. 227,175,695 and going up every second. I don't see how this doesn't double in the next few days with volume like this."
CLGN aid next. Very very low float of 6.5m shares. Any buying will make this pop
"So the word Hedge Fund should instill terror in the conmen wannabes .. that's the moral of this saga. Yet, I think the Feds will step in to prevent continuous selling of good stocks that's bleeding the market and causing mayhem in corporations' ability to raise money for legit business operations. The US stock market and the economy risks losing credibility and causing flight of capital to markets that are run better, i.e., where naked shorting is NOT allowed."
HEDGE FUNDS ARE PANICKINGDON'T SELL

gme is a strong fortress because majority are not selling.we are the real change.We are winning.
"The GameStop saga has taken an unexpected twist, with shares down 62%. GameStop has been the main focus of attention of traders having seen its share price soar more than 300% in the past week. I mostly get my trading ideas from https://daytrading.school/Daily-Trade-Setups They do all the stock analysis and share a potential watchlist comprising of top stocks that you can have your eyes on before the open"
this tanked today because retail buyers were locked out by the brokers not to mention a few halts. this saved the shorts tons of $$$. looks like collusion imo.
I like the 69% percent increase 
do you guys actually think you can make money tomorrow?
Halted... fishy... HOLD!!

"Short Squeeze Gameplan:Once the squeeze begins, always sell at the last highest price, never less. With the amount of shares shorted, everyone will be able to get their share of profits, so don't worry about losing out. The short sellers practically have to buy all the available shares to be completely covered."
RETAIL ARMY! UNITE!#AMC #GME #NOK #BB
who is manipulating the market? people can sell only can not buy!!!!
who are you selling to if no retailer can buy right now?HOLD HOLD HOLD

"GME is owned 110% by institutions. Not sure how, but this is listed on both Nasdaq and CNN website. www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings"
7 MIN LEFT. BE careful!!! It's not over until it's over
"Shorts positions do not expire.Don't sell on Friday.The longer you hold, the less shares available, increasing the price and making it unavailable to these shorters to buy back at lower price.Equals, the longer it takes for shorters to buy back at lower price, equals higher interest charged to them---and higher interest means decreasing profits; so, they got no choice but to buy back shares at a much higher price.But if no one is selling, they have to set their buy order at even higher pricesIf no one is still selling, then they even have to set buy orders at higher price.So just hold."
Me and the lads dropping 200k on AMC.. Get on the ship lets 1000x

"Just bought 1 share as a support. Short sellers have been using nasty tactics and lies to drive down stock price, cause companies to go out of business and investors losing money.

"I just have to say this, when I was your age I was #$%$ my money away drinking at bars and trying to get laid, as much as I suspect that you will end up with about the same amount of money as I did back then, I give you credit for taking on the real big money and their pawns the financial institution banks, the SEC and for that matter social media in general. At least you will have possibly showed the world how corrupt our free and transparent financial markets real are. If you are a wealthy hedge fund you are allowed to blindly short at will to tank stock prices of stocks held by small retail investors, yet when you turn the table on them, that isn't right."
"SEC engaged in a full investigation of attempted collusion to commit securities fraud in GME, AA, NOK!"
Dont sell mtfrs!!!
"Thinking ind'l retail investors can impact a stock (and the market) in the span of days or a week like y'all are saying is like claiming that humans can impact the climate of an entire planet in the span a a few decades.... it just don't work that way.You need a giant intense source of energy to do that... think like the level of the Sun! In market terms, that would be options players throwing millions and millions into CALLs at a time. The narcissism and hubris involved to think that a bunch of millennials on a Reddit board and trading App could do this is astonishing yet sadly all to common these days. Enjoy those bags...."
Only downside to this is the potential regulatory changes that will be made to us buying options. I got a ton of leaps just incase
Look like 360 on the open?I see 600 today if the sellers wait.Buy Buy Buy

Does anyone else think it is funny when a SHORTY loses money?

"Robinhood is the social-media-ization of the stock market. Nothing good can come from it. A law must be passed to not allow free services, no more making money by selling user's information. There is too much of a disconnect between these companies' profits and how they are behaving."

"easiest short in history, just don't go on margin..... be patient... One of the few times in life I wished I was into shorting,.. maybe I'll just get in on some option plays but gotta think the delta on them is insane and unfair, MM, funds etc so much skimming going on here all along the ways, spread is a total joke, so much coin being made on this volume and all these retails think funds are ruined... funds are anything but ruined, they are well funded, will circle the wagons to protect their greed, scam, game and they have patience.. Much more than once the retail herd changes direction and the gates are narrowed....... Funds playing both sides, laughing way to the bank, Govt on their side, husband and wife duos at both locations.. this runs so deep... It's been a blast to watch but take profits, there is a lot of money trapped in the 300-400 range once this goes, good luck to y'all............. be careful, the game is not fair and you are being played hard Mr retail.... I lost it all on Lehman thinking they'd never let it go under, it was one of them............. what do you think happens here, GME management is already in talks to end this, trust they are bestowed to WS and not retail.. the game doesn't change, just it's players........... be careful, good luck, preserve your capital y'all"

$GME $AMC $BB How convenient that the free platforms all stopped trading these stocks yesterday. Just long enough to let the money managers get out at a bottom price.
you guys are gonna do exactly what you think you are fighting against. a few of you will be rich from this. the vast majority will end up holding the bags for the few. the big guys will now start to short this back down to normal... making back all the money they lost. You never did anything. the money was placed there by millions and taken away by hundreds.

Wall Street has a counter for anything you do. They will always win and this stand you’re taking will be forgotten in a couple months. It’s going to take a lot more than this little stunt.

"Regulators will step in on Monday and call the Reddit board ""market manipulation"" ... there has been hints of pursuing action against manipulators ... expect some type of action soon."
"Brokerages colluded with the billionaire hedge funds. Demand legal action from the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services (USHCFS) (financialservices.house.gov/contact/) Email: (Subject: SEC SHO violations; abusive short-selling; Rule 611 of Regulation NMS violations I sent the following email asking for action to USHCFS as well as to POTUS (whitehouse.gov/contact/), my state senators & house representative. NOTE: (govtrack.us) can help you locate their websites & email contact data) NOTE: The “ . “ has been removed from all the URLs in this email & parentheses have been added. “ Please do an investigation on the following: a) SEC’s failure to uphold the SHO regulation; b) the abusive shorting of GME & other stock, c) violations of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS and d) the illegal, discriminatory action by the brokerages that violate the rights of retail investors. Will you, as an elected representatives of the people, allow the fleecing of the small American investor to continue unabated?1) Gamestop (GME) has been on continuously on the Security Threshold list beginning Dec. 8, 2020 through Jan 27,2020 – over seven (7) weeks, which exceeds the maximum of thirteen (13) settlement days. The short interest in GME exceeded the actual float, ranging from 130% to 150% - illegal naked shorting. Per the SHO regulation, SEC should have forced the brokerages to closeout failures to deliver. See: (sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) “… Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement…” “… Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,” if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days…”. 2) On Weds. & Thurs. 01/27-28/2021, brokerages such as Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, Webull, etc. imposed trading restrictions on retail investors but not on hedge funds. Retail investors were prevented from BUYING, while hedge funds continued to both BUY & SELL. Only billionaire hedge funds & others who short stocks are protected while the average retail investor is cheated. The affected securities include AMC, BB, BBBY, EXPR, GME, KOSS, NAKD & NOK. This is discriminatory, and I believe a violation of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS.Over the last few days, the brokerages, analysts & media have painted the retail investors who rallied heavily-shorted companies as the bad guys. In reality if the large firms and short-sellers weren’t engaged in abusive shorting, this rally wouldn’t have been possible nor necessary. If the SEC SHO regulations and the Rule 611 of Regulation NMS had been enforced, again, this rally wouldn’t have been possible nor necessary. If democracy and its rule of law work ONLY for the rich and the powerful, then it’s NOT really a democracy – is it? “"
Put options do not have to be exercised and short selling has no expiration date. What are people talking about when they say the shorts need to be covered by end of day Friday?

"I can still buy up north in Canada, I am loading up on more shares brothers and sisters"
The SEC needs to put an end to short selling and that will stabilize the whole situation. I lost a bundle early last year when HIndenburg announced they wee shorting a company and then reaped the massive benefits of their public announcement. Total bull and should be illegal.
Class action complaint against @RobinhoodAppfiled in the southern district of NY

"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]Robinhood and other brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.Here’s a trick that will work.Go to Feb 5 option.Scroll all the way down the call listBuy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%Immediately exercise.I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!P.S. If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table."
"Shorts have not closed there positions. There are not enough shares for them to covers. If GME closes over 300.00 plus on Friday January 29, billions and billions will be lost by hedge funds. Don’t believe anyone saying they have covered. 140% of shares shorted, with no shares to buy no way out, run this back up for Friday close and make sure GTC GOOD TILL CANCEL IS SET AT 300.00."
They are trying to push it down to cover. Keep buying and holding!!!
These few minutes are will test us....BUY and HOLD
dont sell. too many shares short. do the math
"This company is valued at $26billion. why? have they announced partnerships to download through the Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo stores? Exclusive titles announced?

"It is now clear that SEC is in bed with billionaire hedge funds Citadel's Ken Griffin and Point72's Steve Cohen. It seems SEC directed Robinhood and other online trading brokerage to stop selling $GME, $NOK, $BB, $AMC and other trending stocks to retail investors to allow these hedge funds to manipulate the price and cover at a huge discount. If it is not criminal I don't know what is.By Marc from Nokia Yahoo Forums"
Maybe one day right wingers will start to realize that government isn’t the problem or the enemy. Government isn’t running this country.

"Schumer says $1,400 could come by early next week. Billions will instantly go to GME. Good-bye Citron, Citadel, and Melvin."
We gotta ride this one out to at least $GME level. This has so much potential and we can expect a boom next week! Hold on tight people!

"Short interest my still be high gut make no mistake, most shorts who shorted below $30-50 are long out. High short interest now is on those that added in the past 2-3 days and they won't sell.The retail investor who is buying now will at the end lose his shirt and the winners will the big boys who start shorting now. This may have driven some funds to the brink of bankruptcy but will make other big boys rich in the process."
"Haha shorts HAHA! Haha coastal elite rich investors who love their hedge funds - HA HA! You're scared, losing a lot of money, and you have NO GOOD OPTIONS ahead of you lol. Yeah! Wreck them good! Take this up to $50000 per share and BK wall street market makers and their hedge fund cohorts good! Then watch them have to sell their real estate holdings ON THE COASTS afterwards lol."
Good to go
"These hedge funds are evil. I own an immunotherapy company called Marker Therapeutics that was shorted back in 2018 right when they came out with positive results on pancreatic cancer treatment. Someone is alive a year longer now. They have shorted,this to oblivion and now they can’t raise money due to their low share price. The Baylor Medical center and MD Anderson down in Texas is the best cancer research center in our country and my company is limited to conduct phase 2,s on lymphoma, breast cancer and aml due to these evil hedge funds."
"i was in when the line dropped yesterday, and we saw the news that it's coz of Robinhood, IBKR etc. blocking trades, and we saw in the news how all that has been lifted. Today, it's very clear that the line ie holding world wide and not falling back. Keep holding. The squeeze WILL come."
I have freedom to pay a million $ for a rock. Who the duck are those brokers telling me what to do with my money?

"Listen, I have spare gains from NIO and Tesla and I threw that into $GME and $AMC . I've always been upset with the system that has never worked for the people. I mean man is so powerful, you could blow up the world, destroy many lives, find billionaire and millionaire residentials and start a riot. Yet we play a game that the odds are stacked agaisnt us. Man is so powerful yet we are somehow convinced that we are powerless. This reminds me of big fish little fish. Little fish combined together to take on a big fish or the movie Bugs life.I'm upset because after this. People should wakeup and realize how powerful we truly are. History is written by the victors and you're sold lies that America is so great while being propped up in debt as a country and living paycheck to paycheck.If you just work hard enough, you can be the next Jeff Bezos. Lol please, their are so many smart men and women out there. If everyone becomes rich? Who's going to scrub the toilets?You're all ants in a system that doesn't work for you or anyone you love. Occupy Wallstreet didn't fix or change anything. And if no real big actions are made, this won't either after this is all done."
It's just our stock. Stop telling us to sell it. We like it.
After Hours

"For the blind bears, if you dont see the potential just stick with your ETFs.“The borrow fee on GameStop's stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.""If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the 'supposed' buy-to-covers,"" Dusaniwsky said.GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.” - CNBC"
My 320 option call for tomorrow went from 20k to 5k... I diamond hands it right down to 2k...... Will these options for tomorrow start increasing price in three AM or not until after close????? Hoping to get lucky and get back to 20k.... it's my only investment left
can it get thru 321???
one theory from Tom Nash is that some of the hedge funds literally don't have money to buy back and cover! so they may be selling out of other short positions in other stocks to be able to cover. opportunity everywhere!
"""Buy high and sell low, game of musical chairs."
"I really have to laugh how Andrew Left of disgraceful Citron said they will stop publishing reports about the stocks they short. Big deal, you still are going to short and your nonsense is a red herring. You will try to make everything back by shorting $GME and just not advertising it. I hope the retail trader crushes you. You are a stock market leech. Keep buying $GME folks. Don’t let this guy end up profiting more than he lost by shorting now at $GME highs.Buy $GME"
Melvin if you would have not sold tickets you didn’t have this would not happened!
"$SRNE is the next $GME, it’s going to rocket!"
HOLDING THOUGH WEEKEND
Still holding April 16 puts. So far 8% up. Even though the share price went to the moon.
100% holding
Nobody is selling. Just Hedge funds shorting and buying back to squeeze you out. Just hold and it goes back up. Just a mindgame. HOLD STRONG
Almost all brokers restricted buying today and the stock still ended up over $300 after hours. Tomorrow is going to be insane! 
SNDL is a startup in the next X time it will go don't you see the bigger picture with this stock I'm not talking about $AMC $GME ECT... $SNDL IS ACCTUALY A POTENTIAL INVESTEMENT do your DD american GREEN WAVE IS JUST UPPON US I'm Canadian and seen all this 2 3 YEARS AGO now its USA turn
Are you guys holding over the weekend or selling in afterhours?
Robinhood ceo compared what he did to what Clorox and Lysol had to do! Clorox and Lysol didn’t let some buy and some not! They were out! He on the other hand only allowed individual investors to sell yet somebody was actually buying these shares the institutional and large investors! He literally said it was his decision and wasn’t pressured by anyone! Patronizing and condescending to all individual investors that had to sell today!
"The ticker of Marketwatch is glitching, too."
After hours looks strange. Like the Hedge funds are trying to figure out what to do. lots of one share trades.
Let's go army! BUY AND HOLD! $NOK $AMC $GME $BB $KOSS
$OGEN is a great investment now because they have products aimed at both the prevention and eradication of pandemics.
Should I day trade 1k into gme tomorrow!?
WeBull now allows to buy GME!
I woke up HOLDING!! Adding more at open 
The revolution was betrayed and the counter-revolutionaries won the battle but not the war! Long live the retail investor!
"I am down 8k on $GME, $AMC, $BB. Still holding. Buy and hold and we all will fly to the moon!"
bought in at 405
Let's brake the wheel together! #AMC #GME
ROBINHOOD IS ALLOWING BUYINH TOMORROW!!!!!!!
I’m all for sticking it to shortsellers but I worry about fomo and the mom and pop investor here. Please don’t gamble with money you cannot afford to lose. If you’ve doubled your profit consider selling half and letting the rest of the “house money” ride. That way you won’t be out all your money.
"If Melvin really did cover their position, why is CNBC pumping out promoted posts declaring this? Surely if you closed out your position, you wouldn't have to spend money to spread the word about it"
"Lol yah00’s latest video is saying the SEC is looking into setting regulations for BUYERs for driving the price up, “manipulating” the market squeezing out shorts.  you can’t make this up"

i think this broke the matrix its a endless loop
All those calls in the money
How are there not laws against trading platforms restricting what you can buy and sell in what amount? The other option should be to give the user the option to immedeatly liquidate all assets and the money should appear in your bank account the same second/have the possibility to immedeatly move the whole portfolio to another platform without delay
Does anyone know if the shorts covered today if not what the short percentage is as of now after trading today
"cant , wont , game "
"HOLD ,126K shares were sold from $480 to $120. THIS IS FAKE VOLUME/MARKET MANIPULATIONTHEY WILL NOW START BUYING HOLD THE LINE"
"Big money from china, europe coming in at open. Power to the people, $1000 MINIMUM today."
They put a bias on gme forcing people to sell which is totally not free market. They decided to rig the game because they were losing. Traders should abandon Robinhood and go to another platform.
DON'T SELLL GAME START NOW!!!!!!
"Here is a recommendation to jump on the shorters' back and make them pay big time. I'm in on SAVA and making tons of money and love that you shoved it to the shorts. May they rot in fiery pit of H because they deserve it. Shorting is a zero sum game and investors have to lose for them to make money. Nothing could be worse hoping a fellow investors lose money so the slim in the bit can make money. Seriously, Motley Fool and Seeking Alpha are saying SAVA it is likely to be the best investment in 2021. Not a spam but the true deal."
Block out all hater's and shorties. The big boys on the run....Just hold and keep holding. A bear raid kind of hard when they are over 100% shorted. I want a buy back and a split .
I’ll buy one share because I love u guys
"I have never been so happy to lose money on some puts but I bought a handful when this blew not realizing the intent behind the battle. Keep fighting the good fight and I'll gladly eat my $100 loss. Just come to SRNE after the A holes cover, tons of money to be made there and has very high short interest as well."

"GME management will talk on Monday book it. A capital raise is probably the news. Shares will be offered rather than think about dilution from a long standpoint think about the floor 2+ billion cash will put on the stock. 150? 200? so every short has to walk the plank as they are completely screwed. Trades on Monday over 600, tuesday add another 150, it may cycle out in 5-7 days"
Are the hedge funds buying to cover their shorts.
"The movie about this event is so obvious, I can write it in my head."
"Retail shorts...if you don’t understand it, your world will change too."
It is not about GME anymore. It is about Retail vs Hedge Funds.
"FORGET ABOUT THE REST, THE MESSAGE IS $GME"
I hold no position but am impressed with how well this held up considering we’re heading into the weekend where uncertainty follows. Great job and good luck!
"Robinhood: who wrote the code on your manipulative trading platform, Dominion Voting Systems?"
"AOC, Ted Cruz and Donnie Jr. all agree, you know that you f'd up Robinhood. Retail investors getting punished by the very platform that is designed for them in favor of Hedge Fund Billionaires. Time to get out of Robinhood when the dust settles so no-one is using their platform. Boycott Robinhood"
delete robinhood
I jumped back in!
Not selling!
"GME stock holder, holding over the weekend"
GameStop better put that $13 billion into good use!
"So the Goverment is gonna probe into the GameStop chaos. I wonder who are they gonna look out for, the retail investors or the institutions?"

"THIS EFFING ZUCKS! I can only buy 110 shares. I thought that we lived in the USA! We are NOT free people!!$AAL, $SNDL, $NOK, $GME"
How are people setting sell limits of $5000? My brokerages only let me set it for 50% of last traded price.Does Webull let you do this?
So boys and girls.... let this be a lesson to you. Never start what you cannot finish. Never start what you may not be able to control. And never let greed dictate decisions you make. Like watching a yo-yo. If you're lucky enough to hold shares don't sell. That's what they are begging you to do. Is this the way free markets are supposed to act? LMAO~! Can only sell shares and cannot be a buyer?Shorts trying to buy brokerage houses off? Robin the Hood? Would not touch that app with a 10 foot pole.Unless I had bought a $50 contract for a CALL and made over $3 Gs a couple of days ago. Robin Hood may have over extended itself. GME poised to run again...... cannot stop a moving freight train like this... but they are trying to apply the brakes..... at the cost of $BILLIONS.......My my....Gotta love it. Entertainment at its best.
Above 320 is a win!!!
Ultimately what they need to do is ban and eliminate short selling. It has done nothing good for the market.
we neutral boys 
"When this first started, I truly support the cause! We did it and got our message across to the whole world. Now people are just taking advantage of the situation and turn it into a Ponzi scheme. Go read Reddit how many retails investors got burned today when the price dropped from 500 to 133."
Do the brokerage companies violate law by restricting buying but ok for selling ?
These Are The 8 Best SPACs To Buy Right Now Check out https://youtu.be/vB5FD8DXnvs
"This stock and the movement behind it has amazes me. Not tied to fundamentals anymore and the battleground of big money vs individual investor. Big money doing everything and more to scare people out of their shares. Shareholders see the blatant attempts at manipulating a low share price and not only held, but got angry and bought more once big money allowed them to buy again. During this time, it went down from $400 to $100, but shareholders mostly held strong and did not sell. When has that ever happened??? The group not breaking to what should be an illegal attempt to scare them didn’t work and the stock jumped back to over $300. Just amazing. I don’t see shareholders getting scared to sell even if this goes back to $1 tomorrow. They will hold and push it back to whatever new all time high and this cycle will repeat until short % gets to 100% since there won’t be that extra leverage in play. Until then though, each day big money holds or tries to grow the short %, they actually are making it worse on themselves which they still don’t realize. Will be interesting to see how this ends."
Melvin capital named hedge fund of the year for those who love losing money
Put some of your gains in $INKW! recent Amazon partnership + Walmart soon. End goal from the company is to be listed in NASDAQ!
They have no right to tell the individual investors how to spend there money. You think if the roles were reversed anything would have been done? Please.Oh you made to much money got to cut you off cause our Billionaire buddy’s need to cover.
If you don’t understand what is really going on! All you need to do is HOLD your shares! Institutional investors selling off and buying back to trick you into selling! When the shorts expire we name our price
"Open over $500, same as yesterday's action before they shut down buy orders?"
Contribute 30k as my part.. Lets meet the target $1000+... Hedgefunds covered and no one will stop this before 1000$
Keep buying upwards don’t stop I wants to see it breaks 500 today
Management needs to do a $1.2 Billion stock offering. Pay off there debt. Stock price would fly to $500
Does anyone remember me in here last night saying they stole your money and all the thumbs down and hate I recieved for it? How many times I was called a bot or thinking I was trying to get you to sell when I even said go ahead and buy. To all you people I just wanna say....
The short sellers lose $60M everytime the stock increases $1 - other institutions smell blood and will try to make as much money on the bankruptcy of the other firms. DO NOT SELL
I don’t believe it either. And you know what? If it is true there is something deeper there than stock losses
Papa Musk is buying!
So all day you could sell but not buy? Who were you selling to then?
To the MOON!
"Stop selling we're golden, flying"
"The shorts are just buying up the shares to increase the price, then dump at 9am to create panic and force us to sell!! Stay strong and hold."
They will try to ladder short sell in the last 10 mins to scare you. Hold steady and laugh at them in AH!’n
Buying even more shares on these dips. People just don't understand that the SQUEEZE HAS NOT EVEN STARTED
"The casino economy has to end. End to shorting, derivatives and every other convoluted “investment vehicle” they came up with to f over people"
Bought the dip and willing to lose it all. Big middle finger to all the shorts from the little guys
"GME. from 120$ to over 300 again in just over an hour, wait until tomorrow for the wildest of rides, once the 200,000 or so IN-THE-MONEY Call options are exercised"
Did anyone else notice how Cramer suddenly went missing last week during the whole Robinhood scandal supposedly with a “pinched nerve” and then magically returns on Friday urging us all to sell $GME and AMC  It’s so obvious that Jim Cramer is PART OF THE CORRUPTION. He is trying to save his hedge fund buddies from getting slaughtered by us 
"A few things i have realized in the past few days, we are nothing but dumpster divers, stray dogs on the street looking for scraps eat, beggars asking for a handout. Forget about being invited to the table, they call the cops on us when be get close to the community. With all of this we manged to make a decent meal with all the scraps we found #GME and #AMC and the elites couldn't even let us have that. They came and tried to take our meal again, and helping those elites are people we thought were our friends @robinhood instead of our friends helping us we get sold out to elites and have to find a harder battle. If you sell #GME below $1000 and #AMC below $200 you will be a loser for the rest of your life and will be a slave to the elites. Think about that 1 person in your life who is part of the 1 percent and by holding these stocks, you are directly hurting them."
"The concept being touted everywhere on Social that the entire board of WSB will jump on this or that other stock as an alternative to GME is a fallacy! As this stock sinks it becomes clear that not everyone understands the strategy and/or grievances with the whales! Firstly its imperative to concentrate all fire power on obtaining and holding as much GME stock as possible. Think Star Wars and blowing up the Emperors Star Destroyer The mission has nothing to do with making any profit! The fewer GME shares available on the open market, the fewer shares the wales can purchase (from you selling!!) to cover there short positions. Without getting technical, this forces the share price up and cripples the big players (whales) leading to huge losses and their timely demise! Only once the above mission is complete dose it make any sense for them to move on to the next target, and of course then bringing the slaughtered whale’s capital with them! $AMC $BB $DOGE etc. is just noise!Combine that with the above restriction’s and you may be wasting your time pumping DOGE or anything else for now, as all its doing is deflecting the vital resources away from the main target. Of course the whales know this, hence the spikes we have seen overnight tricking the retailers into FoMo.Dont be suckered in, and dont underestimate the will of the underdog! Good luck."
HAHAHHAHHA WE DID IT
This isn’t even about the stock anymore. This is for ‘08! To WAR!
Just bought 23 shares
Geee time to buy in but they locked investors out. Stock market is fixed.
"This is not just for the money, this is for the fariness, the balance in the world... for one time, we, the peope, can defeat the preconstituted powers.We can demonstrate that with the union, we can reach every purpose we have.HOLD YOUR SHARES""LONG&STRONG$SRNE $INO $GME $AMC $VXRT"
I’m so excited to watch them buy back and fall deeper into their own sick twisted game. DO NOT SELL! HOLD AND BUY THE DIP!!!!!! Easy rule to follow if you want the tables to turn on these short seller investors.
"Lets protest, buy GME! Forget the risk involved this is about proving our point. WE WANT ECONOMIC LIBERALISM"
rich retail investors are the new market swing force.
"Please SELL ALL stocks longed by institutions, and buy stocks shorted by them, like $GME $AMC $BB $NOK, to join our battle, and let those market makers, which sucked people’s hard earned money and became corrupted, to SUFFER more! This week's market crash is the sign of our great victory, and we will continue to fight against MM! Next week will be a bloodier one for the crash of this corrupted market!! See you soon!  You can join our WSB subreddit to discuss and share our strategies next week!"
"HOLD. IF you have less than 25k in your account. Don't try to swing/day trade this. You might be lock out for days if you want back in, missing your target profits. if the stock price to rise your have to hold."
"We are retail investors. $GME Worked because it was a united group. So we branched out to $AMC, $BB which was all fine. Then it all went backwards when we spread out our buying power and tried to include every cheap stock. The principal of what we were trying to achieve went out the window. Time to unify."
The shorts still aren't covering their GME losses yet because they think they can bribe DTCC officials to rig the stock market in their favor. They're wrong.
Don't worry about after hours. Means nothing. HOLD THE LINE! 
Doomers trying to act like the gamma was supposed to be today. You are so obvious every tactic you try fails immediately. Maybe try not showing up at the same time saying the exact same thing
People find a different platform and leave Robinbood. Perhaps we could find a new trading stock company.
this is war...not for shorts...
"When this stock goes to 70usd I can retire. And the guys Shorting can start working.I love reddit, I love $AYTU $AMC $NOK $GME $BB"
I just bought 10 shares of GME through Schwab. A much superior brokerage.
Tomorrow robinhood will open up trading !!!!
cant stop wont stop gamestop
"Man everything is locked down hard in Australia at the moment. I cant even send money between my accounts. Also all the crypto exchanges I have accounts with have removed Doge or wont accept new money into the account.... Good luck to the rest of you, I hope you guys mamage to pull it off! #Doge #GME # AMC # NKED # NOK"

"Hold, they have to cover and drive it up tomorrowSame thing about to happen to BTSC"
infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out
"Looks like Wallstreet is playing games again. They are allowed to short stocks and at the same time, they ban people from buying stocks. That will rocket the stock down. Hope they allow people to buy again soon and reverse this trend."
the world is now in for support...
Are we still buying and holding to stick it to the man?
"It's just a Gamma squeeze if you sell now you will miss the best part of the brand new movie ""The Big Squeeze"" the sequel to ""The Big Short"" written and directed by Adam McKay. ""I got my DIAMOND HANDS and I'm gettin these TENDIES because I am a R*&@#!"" - Roger Ebert ""HOLD UNTIL THEY FOLD. CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP, GAMESTOP!!!"" - Leonard Maltin"
There is too much deficit for the shorts to cover even if they liquidated completely. This is built on a foundation of air.
Buy $ZOM. March product launch is just around the corner for your woofs and meow pals.
ypu guys are spread out over to many stocks ur losing ur power
TD won't let me put a high sell limit anymore. What a hatchet job
Don't sell your shares! GME is our movement and investment to our future of free market and free capitalism for the little guy that always gets left to pick up the crumbs.
Never mind aftermarket - this will open 400+ and keep flying.
"GameStop is the new Bitcoin, taking money out from BTC and placing all of them on GME."
"Are people really holding indefinitely? There are not enough shares to cover. How does the market even correct this? The end game has to be that some hedge funds cover. Only way that happens is if they're forced. SEC, do your job."
crazy fun to watch - let's see if you can gt it back to $500?
"One thing that all these events confirm (RH/other brokerages pulling the rug out from under us, media villainizing us, apple/google removing our reviews etc) is that the same corps that are in business bc of us and our $$ will sell us for a quick buck. When this is all over, there are multiple other battles coming. They are scared bc if united, they know they cant keep their billions"
going to the moon after hours
should i buy now $GME $AMC $GEO ?? will it still go up ??? please advise
Lol Robinhood is closing out people’s positions for them. Sue them into the ground!
Game on tomorrow. Ready to buy again on Robinhood
Show your support that the little guy is somebody too. Buy one share and hold if you desire to show you care
SHORTS CAN BUY MY SHARES AT $5000 TOMORROW
"Guys, Citron Research is no longer posting shorting reports. https://youtu.be/TPoVv7oX3mw"
GME - how many shares are not existing an must be covered?40 million shares or more?Ok - GME can make a private placement raising some billions by emitting 40 million shares - but financial system may be has to pay a lot of money to the company.But gambler which are betting on a continuation of the short squeeze with no available shares should be aware of the risks of such bets.
Way to go Mr. small time trader making a lot of money on Gamestop while the big boys with all the money are losing their butts!!!! That's awesome! I lost a lot of money during the financial crisis back in 08-09 and I didn't get a bailout while all the big banks did! Hard for me to feel sorry for the big greedy financial institutions.....loving every minute of hearing this story! Congrats to all who made big money on this stock....GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!
T212 now allows again to trade $GME and $AMC
If can't afford a share find your nearest short and give them a hug. It might not be the squeeze you want but it'll certainly be the squeeze they'll need after we're done with them.
"If you sell, you will feed the funds. The ones who have billions of dollars. And we, the poor ones, will loose again! Come on! BUY and HOLD!"
"They will test us today, just hold strong and I promise we will rocket. THIS IS A MOVEMENT"
buy now get it up
"If you haven't read this and are holding or considering holding GME without out understanding why you are doing this, read JeffAmazon's blog titled ""The REAL Greatest Short Burn of the Century"" (and Parts II and III).It is a very coherent explanation of what led up today as he predicted this in October 2020. He even predicted GME to hit $400 when at the time of the post, GME was only priced at $13-14/share.Perform your due diligence and Google: ""RedditThe REAL Greatest Short Burn of the Century"""
DONT PANIC https://preview.redd.it/7fzsbti8i3e61.jpg?width=504&auto=webp&s=12d5aab924ac8ca87315b059e8322549631c6a63
Short Interest is increasing and squeeze will hit even harder! HOLD
After hours will be funny!
Literally me these past few days. What a ride.
"Message to all of you... you worked together to get the stock up and take a stand. You have shown the world that the ""little guy"" can still make a difference. Stocks werent the best option in my opinion. Im pretty confident a large amount of people on here will be in devastated financial situations when GME drops 99 percent. I wish people the best. In this situation you will be creating the same sitiation you dispise top 1 percent will be super rich the rest will lose their shirts. Goodluck on Monday everybody."
"Team, DFV is still holding, with $14M loss today. If he is holding I am holding."
"Good luck to everyone today. The day of reckoning is upon us. Can’t stop, won’t stop, GameStop."
Short squeeze the next few days. Brokers will burn for their deception! 1000 USD Monday morning!
DO NOT SELL. This is a gold mine. These shorts have billion$ and billion$ to give away. They are stuck and they're desperate for sellers on the way up!!
"We rally, they halt us"
"Bought 300 shares this morning, will hold forever."
YAY....WE DID IT GUYS!!!!
"Low volume because no one can buy except shorts. That's why if you don't sell (I won't, you won't, we won't) tomorrow shorts will have no choice but to buy the stock at our price. What price? Up to each and everyone of us to decide. But the king has spoken(DPV), and he said 1000$. You can set your limit order now 1000$. And don't panic, we'll all have the chance to sell at this price because the shorties need to buy more than 100% of all shares available."
"If you are scared now, please do me a favour and go to the following channel on Youtube before you sell today: „Gamestop GME Short Squeeze Live News and Updates with Stock Markets with Bruce“. I‘m here, too and i‘m not scared at all!The game is not over yet! Please check this out before you sell!"
Spread the word. Crowds should join our fight against WS corruption.
another good day
"CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON SEC & REGULATORS (include that William Gavin guy from MA)Today Trading and Market Rules are being bent by regulators. Their premise - protecting the stock market and thereby pension funds (i.e., Gods Work). Market makers and Hedge Funds that sold 29-Jan-2021 CALLS will owe public $60B if GME closes $300 on Friday. Lot more for higher close - dollar for dollar. Market Makers don't have $100-$300B sitting around and would have to force liquidate or crash the market. OK OK - Rule number 1 is you should only sell a call (or put) if you have underlying funds. Why did the MMs break that Rule? Why are the regulators not questioning that? Is it because MMs have broken this rule 10,000 times in the last decade and regulators have simply watched their favorite shows on TV? If you agree and support an investigation, please press like so this stays on top. Thank you."
"Folks can learn from them boys at Wallstreet Bets. This is what is called Diamond Hands  The ones who are scared, it’s ok. But remember how this played out. Your brokers lent out too many shares to greedy Wallstreet hedge funds to short a stock. When things didn’t go the way they wanted, they blocked you from buying more shares and then the short sellers tanked the price. Compare the volume of shares today with the last few days. The fear is understandable. Some of us have iron grip and I wanna see how this all ends. "
This is political action and I love it
BUY AND HOLD COMRADS
Hope this does not crash trading apps again 940am Friday
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD. HOLD GME
Certainly got their attention though!https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/gorman-says-reddit-rally-traders-are-headed-for-rude-awakening/ar-BB1daN2e?li=BBnb7Kz
we have come so far. it's ok. I have lost in the past I can always make up or scale down but this needs to be supported
"Shortselling and buying back right after to keep this down. Just a mindgame, if we hold, they have to buy the shares we own. Price 1000$! Btw. Stilll over 120%Short interest."
"Don't cry when this crashes again and fades away as it was never meant to go up this high. It's all manipulation and I truly can't understand why someone would even play with this. Well I guess since casinos are closed, you could call it online gambling."
Tomorrow restrictions on how many shares to buy but not for hedge funds! Seriously there needs to be some jail sentences here for robin hood ceo and whoever else goes along with that.
"GME to $10,000 share please. I want to see this hit $1T market cap."
GREAT JOB EVERYONE! SEE YOU NEXT WEEK!!!
Will explode in pre market and open over 500+.We can do it!
Hit the ask! no circuit breakers in the after hours. Trading will reopen for Robinhood tomorrow. We're coming for astronaut buyers at $500
"20mins to go, keep this above 300!! Come on brothers one last stand!"
Congrats to all the history maker’s
don't sell they gonna spoof the stock down again like yesterday don't fall for it
We got them! all they can do is playing with the stockprice for a moment with shorting and buying it back from the same hedge funds. But tomorrow with the gamma squeeze they cant hold their position any longer!
"I love this slow grind up, acting just like $GME did when it was a youngster."
"BUY NOW, HOLD TIL 500 EOD!!!"
"Tomorrow will be a day full of volatility, but the odds are on our side. I expect a gap up pre market, followed by a dip when opens and strong rally towards the end of the day. The fight is far from over, I suggest everyone to hold their shares throughout the weekend. I mean, you can only lose 100% of your position, but the upsides is unlimited with any of these gamma squeezes. The bet is asymmetrical and we are for sure going to crown the victory. LETS GO - HOLD THE LINE! $AMC $GME $BB $NAKD $KOSS $NOK"
What makes GME and AMC very Dangerous for shorts and Hedges is that both stocks are in an EXPONENTIAL CHART PATTERN UP.....BIGTIME!
"TD Ameritrade allows buying GME / GameStop Corp.I checked this on Thursday.If you have with TD Ameritrade a margin account, you will not be able to use margin if more than 50 percent of your cash will buy AMC or GME."
"I realize we are fighting manipulating hedgies and pumping up stock price, but how can we pump sales at GME? Been to a GME store or a mall lately?"
"We shall not, we shall not be moved."
I thought it was supposed to be a free market?
"GME, AMC, and INO longs are dominating the shorts today!GLTAL"
"They halt us, they restrict us, they vilify us. But we never give up! The battle continues!! Onward and upward!!!"
"$AMC, $NOL, $BB, $GME still available in Canada. We are gonna buy and hold. Leave RH and move to another broker."
Diamond hand! Hold the line! If Robin Hood did not pull that stunt this would have been at a thousand
Shorts TRAPPED they tried to scare people out and failed !They are cooked now ! Very few shares for sale.5000 shares bought would bring this close to 300.00They threw everything they had this am and now we just go higher...Hold your shares hedge funds are toast now !
"Hedge Fund shorters, and individual Day Traders, are both >> Colluding to conspire: a non-competitive and sometimes illegal agreement between rivals which attempts to disrupt the market's equilibrium. The act of collusion involves people or companies which would typically compete against one another, but who conspire to work together to gain an unfair market advantage."
"Let's show Citron and GS that we will over come the EVIL Wall Street market manipulators and give them their medicine!!!NOW\COme on $GME, SAMC and $pltr support retailors now!"
LOL All the shorties here....all you have to do is look at the history of their convos. They reveal themselves
"Sell while you can. once all the brokerages block purchases, who will buy yours?"
Massive stock manipulation driven only by greed. You folks are lying to each other and yourselves.
GOTTEM BOIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WATCH OUT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!!!!!!!
Reddit bringing in thousands of European investors tomorrow to help bring this to the moon tomorrow !!!  over $500 by noon 
68 million shorts to cover!! Let them start it
It wasnt just the blocking of buying. There needs to be a federal investigation into the possibility of Ladder Selling which would have artificially drove down the price of the stock AT THE SAME TIME as the block in buying.This would show without a doubt market manipulation by the hedges
"Only sell at $1,000. Make them pay $1,000 for each share!!!!!!!!!"
VICTORIOUS!!!!
Love it. We are unstoppable!
"Can Anyone tell me, What happens when the hedge fund cant cover the stock?"
FYI Robinhood only allowing buys of only 1 share per customer for gme. Institutions don’t have that restriction with other brokersPer CNBC
"If you guys give assurance that you will keep the uptrend ongoing, then I need a break.Thumbs up  if I can have sweet dreams."
"Please everyone read. If you are using a broker that took part in the highly illegal market manipulation yesterday, change brokers AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I am currently with Trading 212 and will be transferring my entire portfolio over to Fidelity when the short squeeze is over."
"Blessings in disguise, if you believe in 1000 thesis you might believe in higher price 1000+... Why? They let new short position in 400 to 200 ... reminds me of $tsla short squeeze cycle"
WEBULL IS ALLOWING $GME TRADES AGAIN - Let's DO This

SEC investigation of brokerages that stopped investors from buying. That is criminal what they have done.
"The only way out for shorts is BK, because they are filling up their margin calls. They are at net 0. They will liquidate, that is the only way out. GME is going to $10,000+."
"good..$CYDY can go up higher next week. no worry shorts...you guys can short when it's at $10...even better when it gets to $100. Maybe at $GME level...you short will really like it then, even more money!"
"“ we can be heroes, just hold for one more day”"
"Wait till paypal takes Doge. I think the hoodies are frustrated with limited shares, and had a bunch of $GME and $AMC money they put here. I know I did."
Old guy here and bought $5k of GME to show my support
"I am an investor and dont want to make any point. But what is happening here is HISTORIC. This is a financial system occupy movement. Because RH had strickt limits on users to buy this, I went ahead and tripled my position to do a little bit on my part to help out the BIG cause. If you have something little on side, BUY. Make your point. This will go up next week and we should make a stand for those who cannot but deserve justice. little guys have been robbed too long."
Why is this going up after market? I thought all brokers still banned it for retailers?
"rich is a social status. nothing without people. rich is just taking/took a lot from a lot of people and keeping more. only because of people and need a lot of people. people build everything and make it work. corp, companies, gov, status, rich, society/system, etc. not 1,2,or few. everyone's taking and getting. of course, who doesn't want to be rich in the money-society? but how much? there's, ""your fair share/reward,"" and there's, ""want more and all (greed)."" you became rich? good. let somebody else have some so it'll be good for everyone. all lives are heading the same way and then everything will keep going."
"How in the hell did they drop the stock price from the $440's down to $135 in a little over an hour with relatively lower volume? Seriously if this isn't manipulation, I do not know what is."
HOLD AND/OR BUY AT ALL COST
THIS IS HISTORY.... this moment will forever change the moment HF companies are able to short a company.Remember HFs now have days to buy the stocks. They have until Tuesday latest Wednesday.
Great job Avengers.
"Buy buy buy GME, AMC, CYDY"
buying again$EXPR. after hours and pre market will be explosive $GME $AMC
it's a disappointment that Robinhood is supposed to be for the smaller investors. and the lock out BUYING. its a free market only when it best suits them. No Different than taking points from a winning team so loose wins.
“Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management. Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to people taking back the free market. Citadel owns the app Robinhood. Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH. Market manipulation.”
bought 10 shares this morning at $305  Let's do this people!
"There’s an elephant in the room, and sooner or later it will become real. There’s no way for everyone to get out as winners. There will be bag holders. It’s the law of averages. The higher this goes, the more the eventual bag holders will lose. Unless you buy up all the float and hold forever. I’m not in this stock, but I know from experience what is going to eventually happen. By trying to get the buyers above 300 profits, you create buyers above 400, etc. I know it’s not totally about money, but some longs are gonna get hurt financially- no, not as bad as some shorts, but hurt, nevertheless. How much more do you want to prove? They’ll never respect you no matter what, but when this is done, will you respect yourself? I’m glad my money is mostly tied up in a 401k that I can’t touch yet or I’d be in the same predicament. Final word- it may not happen for awhile, but eventually someone will catch a falling knife."
LOOK AT THE 5MIN CHART. YOU SEE THE LADDER GETTING WEAKER? THEY TRIED IT EVERY HOUR. THE FALL THAT ENDED 30MINS AGO WAS THERE (ALMOST) LAST CHANCE. THEY HAVEN'T MADE IT. THEY COULDN'T BREAK THE 250 LINE. THE RESISTANCE IS STRONG RIGHT NOW. BUT WE ARE STILL COMING THROUGH. LET'S
CYDY is another heavily shorted and manipulated stock . Cytodyn just like GME will be soon announcing its COVID trail results for Leronlimab / Vyrologix and already had fantastic results in HIV trials . Short sellers sold way too many shares in CYDY and a short square is coming
"Guys, a few words from a 15 years equity investor, daily futures, equity and commodities day trader. I celebrate (i really do) the pump up of this stocks (which i guess you know doesn't have to do at all with company fundamentals). These moves allow normal middle class people like us to have dreamed money upsides, and in the end, is an interesting way to re-distribute wealth from edge-funds to the people. BUT we need to now when to sell. Why? because in the short term (days / not weeks) the stock price will go back to a level that reflects the reality (and future potential of course) of the company, and that is the price we saw in GME or other stocks before this moves. So I humbly recommend to think and reflect on this. Melvin is just 1 fund and it's not broke. We on the other hand will loose all the gains and part of the capital we invested long in GME, when the hype ends and the stock naturally finds its price. This is a great journey for all of us. Don't be emotional. Be cold minded and smart. Cheers."
30% to 40% short interest on $RLFTF that has a covid phase 3 trial result 'read-out' expected late Jan / early Feb per NeuroRx that ran the trial in the US. yes it's on OTC but it's showing significant gain on the day of 70%+ with FOMO but also hoping someone got attached trying to ferret out the short interest. Do your own DD price target may be $20.
"What GameStop should do now is have a 10-1 split. This will afford the normal joe's from WSB to go on a buying frenzy again forcing the hedge funds to cover. If we keep repeating this cycle, everyone will get rich and we wouldn't need any government stimulus or even have a 9-5 job"
"In my opinion we are stretching ourselves too much. To many stocks on the board. We should as a group select the stocks we want to work with to control the supply. It stated with $GME. And has gone too wild. I thought we were focusing on $BB, $AMC Now every day new stocks appear and were spreading ourselves thin."
hold and buy
I'm. Not. Selling!
"!!!!!!!!!!!!!! when Robinhood lifted the restriction after mkt or tomorrow, I bet GME will explode once again! Short sellers better cover their shorts at 220 now"
"They tried to play dirty today with RH stopping buys. Let's show them we're not playing games. I have a meager $3000 in for 10 shares, but I'm happy to lose it just to see these hedgers squirm and lose."
For a trading platform to decide you cannot make your own decisions with your own money is basically signing their own death warrant. Reminds me of Twitter deciding that people can no longer share their opinions on politics. This will not end well for the manipulators!
"Where is you courage,,,,buy, buy, buy. We need $400 to send a strong signal to Citron."
"@BrausUKShort sellers haven't closed a fraction of their positions yet - 112% short ratio still available. They think they can outlast you, the retail investor. Prove them wrong! $GME HOLD"
i just bought at 350 do you think it will get back up. they sell so many games
I bought more out of principal. This is war between retail investors and hedge funds. Together we can hold the line and make them pay.
"It mean all the platform Robinhood, Schwab, TD etc are not willing to support retail investor when bad happened. Honestly I wish some of us one day could built the trading platform stronger enough to support solely retail investor benefits as priority."
Artificial drop. After a halt it drops? I don’t think so. I’m not selling
"Listen, I do understand the concept of what you're doing : Sticking it to the big guy. But right now, this whole endeavour is not only destroying the hedge funds, they are destroying Retail investors portfolios. These huge companies try to cover their losses from GME by shorting other stocks. it just feels like the initial goal got swept away by your greed, and now it's robbing other people of their hard earned gains."
"Proud to be an Aussie and part of this with you guys. This is a world thing, not just a US thing!"
"still bot trading , wait until the retails sets up,"
do NOT sell on any dip. it dips as it goes up to the sky!!
"GME shorts are going to try push the price down pretty hard right before closing to make calls expire OTM. The gamma squeeze wont't happen until after today's close. The short squeeze is not happening until the gamma squeeze pushes the price up to serious margin call levels.Basically you can look at it like this. Calls get exercised and price goes up over the weekend. Brokers start sweating over the weekend, they margin call the shorters first thing monday and give them 1-2 days to cover. This will drive the price up even more.The next shorter gets their margin call, rinse and repeat.Keep in mind I’m not a financial advisor, this is just my opinion, and I know nothing. I just like the stock."
Everyone go to reddit and get info there. Also hold please. Don’t let shorts cover.
Hold tightly
LAST BATTLE LETS GO
Back to $300!! And to think we were at $176 only an hour ago. lmao.

"How much after market buy are from institutions covering their positions? If you think retailers investors still have a fighting chance you are deadly wrong. Bull trap is really, tomorrow everyone keep buying to push it up then hedge fund will flush the market will all the shares they gather today and make back the billion they lost"
If you're dooming or shilling lesser memes here you haven't been paying attention. We're riding this to Armageddon
Question: Is GME saved now? Does this still continue?
zom is being held down by sabby ugh! market manipulation at its finest by big institutions. let let the small retail investors win ! #ame #gme #nok #nakd

"REPOSTED FROM WSB Reddit also applies to KOSS - PLEASE SHARE THIS AROUND! TODAY IS A CRITICAL DAY! (Copied and pasted)The limit imposed by Robinhood and others on how many shares you can purchase (vs unlimited selling) will make things very hard for us. There is no guarantee that squeeze will happen today. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. Hedge funds are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation that Today is make-or-break for $GME so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DO NOT FALL FOR IT BECAUSE SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. It may be Friday or could be next week but for sure one day we will see the real squeeze. Until that time comes hold the #$%$ line.REMEMBER ENEMY IS NOT FIGHTING BACK BECAUSE WE ARE WEAK, BUT BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG. THEY KNOW THEY ARE LOSING THE BATTLE! AND NOW THEY FEAR US. THEY FEAR OUR BRAVENESS, FEARLESSNESS, HONESTY & MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ??> UNITY.WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S TODAY OR NEXT WEEK5,000+ ?????????"
How can they blame retailer traders when hedge funds can short 140% of a stock.THATS 40% MORE SHARES THAN EXIST.We keep this above 300 and they'll have to cover meaningful massive rise

"For once, we have politicians on our side, and so many others - outraged at RH attempt to squash free market!! Just follow Elon.... He tends to make good business decisions and he's still all in."
Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc's user agreement is likely to protect the brokerage app from a barrage of lawsuits filed by customers after it blocked a frenzied trading rally in companies such as GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) that was fueled on social media forums.
"Google deleted over 100,000 horrible reviews for robinhood"

Can anyone explain what's going on here?
"Repost Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying.

Hedge Funds
Not selling. Stay with me guys.
To all of you that say hold -> Please give me and the others that read this WHY you say hold and whats your Target and WHY that target is your target. Ive been thinking since the beginning of the day what to do and up until now the best decision was to sell at the opening
Who here has over 500k invested and has been telling people to hold? Who here has 1-5 shares invested and have been telling people to hold?
ok Im in with 1 share!
"The entire world is watching what you guys have done. United, your slaying giants. Giants that believe they run the world and all others follow."
"Hold! There's no volume on what looks like a selloff, that's just the same shares being traded back and forth between the suits to give the appearance of one. Also, I support this: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6b1r2/dd_gpro_earnings_and_the_next_short_squeeze/"
Who else is going to buy today when the hedge funds force a dip in GME stocks with manipulation?
Whos up more than 100K in past 2 days?!
"We're here to own the stock, not to look at the price.If a strange man knocked on the door to your house and said that you should sell your home before it loses value, you'd laugh at him and slam the door in his face. Why would we do the same thing with our business, and why do we even put up with these nonsensical people trying to scare us into selling? And why does another one keep knocking on our door every 30 seconds telling us the price will go down? Like, what the hell is going on with these people who are desperate to scare us into selling our business?"
So did Melvin and Citadel really reconcile their shorts??? Saw a news story saying they did?
"The GME squeeze is a deadlocked with those taking the short side risking infinite losses while the re-arded wsb long siders are risking the money's they fronted for shares. Shorts can never all cover unless Game Stop company issues enough shares for shorts to cover or they FUD the longs into panic selling. The hedge funds shorted more GME than existing shares.The long time shorts pay roughly 20% interest while newer shorts are being charged up to 50% interest. These fees are percentages of the share price.Longs are being charged nothing to sit on their shares reading-posting online and playing video games in their mom's basement. As longs are using money they don't need, they can hold forever. As time goes by this equation only changes as interest rate charge fluctuate.Shorts are holding a losing hand, but will spend a lot of money before admitting it. The danger to everyone is that to pay off their short fees the short seller ixiots will sell everything else they control to pay the owed fees, thereby dropping the entire market. We already saw this week how the big guys can collude to shut off retail buyers to get cheaper shares to cover. Reminds one of the 2008 scams they pulled of Scot free.I propose GME longs agree to take 1 bit coin per 1 share GME, thereby tying the GME `bubble`- squeeze to the btc bubble.I can be bought out for 100 btc.Shorts can write it off as over due fees for 2008."
"E1 should understand this is the hegemony war between the RICH and WE, ordinary people. They have been exploiting us for long time. But it is time to change. WE TOGETHER, STRONG!!!$GME, $AMC, $BB, $NOK"
"Buyer from dubai , im in with you .. together we can do it , im never closing this position"
"Heres what Wall Street is saying. They are trying to exhaust the retailer right now and basically hope everyone gets tired and eventually starts selling. Its more propaganda. The shorts will have to cover and pay back shares owed to the retailer. This stagnation of volume will pass.HOLD or buy if you Like the Stock!""At some point, the thinking goes, shares of GameStop will stop climbing, either because most of the shorts have given up and are no longer forced into buying the stock to cover losing positions or because brokers or U.S. market regulators intervene.At that point, human nature kicks in: Retail investors will watch as their paper profits evaporate, and the natural impulse will be to sell, according to the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Latecomers to the party will sell in fear, contributing to a stampede for the exits and a drop in the shares, they added. The same forces that helped the stock catapult higher will contribute to a rapid decline."""
We can buy today. Is this still on again or no
"Funny my broker who cause me total panic and I loss $200K in potential profit, Today I can do what ever I want without any restriction.Just amazing yesterday I am not able to reduce risk for my dangerous naked short calls.Today I can roll, buy spread, sell spread, sell strangle buy what ever I like to do. Not a single time I get error saying you are not allowed to do that."
After hours will explode. Just hold that level!
Halt again
This will open at $350
$GME to 1000 $CLSK to 50.
Hedge funds especially Citadel account for 40% of robinhood revenue due to them selling inside info on market buys and sells and keeping us in the darkThis is personal. Buy and hold every last share!!
the world is with us!be the changemy opinion
Very nervous about this stock. The volume of shares has decreased significantly from when it was sky rocketing. This could be because people are having hard times trading it or it could be people think it’s going to crash. I’m tempted to buy 100 shares and short 100 shares to see which way it goes.
Short interest > 100% is proof of naked short selling. Criminal hedge funds and regulators.
Hold and stay strong! (Everything I say is not financial advice I just like the stock) 
why it's dropping. are they playing games
My last warning to all. Do some research. Invest in good companies. That’s how you do well in the market. If you buy shares of any of the garbage stocks. You will lose your money. Take care.
"Don’t be weak stay, we are almost to the squeeze. Next week we will all be in the money. Contracts are up today, hedges will eventually have to cover the difference and buy back. It won’t happen till next week, we have to stay above $115 to make it. Don’t give up yesterday was a battle and today is going to be easy, if we just hold."
"The stage has been set. The people have been segregated and vilified by the politicians. Left vs right. Democratic vs Republican. Liberal vs conservative. At this instance though, we all have one commonality; we all want a little piece of the pie for ourselves. They tell us to wake up go to work. Rinse and repeat til the day we die. The day we the people finally have the wealthy in check of the centuries old game, it comes with more rules and regulations for our safety. Thus we are continually guided down the shoot to provide the wealthiest with our sweat and tears for their rise. Just remember the elected are supposed to work for us. And yet it’s a cyclical process of wealthy lobbying the elected to reign in regulations to benefit themselves while exploiting the people. It’s our time to exploit the problem that created the beast itself."
Funny part of the whole thing is $NOK doesn't need anyone help including $GME buddies (congratulations) or wallstreetbet guys. This is a genuine 5G infrastructure story with revenues sad to say bigger then some so called EV Bigwigs and actually pays a dividend. Just a matter of time 
It’s beautiful!
just bought 100 3.59 pm hahaha
They probably recoverd about 10 million shares by now thanks to weak hands. HOLD STRONG
GUYS WE CRUSHED YAHOO TICKER LOL
$AAL $GMC $GME will up 100% tomorrow .. Join Spartans..
I’m not bashing this stock but take ur profits this battle between hedge fund is no benefit if this thing goes down to $100 or below that you will regret why I didn’t sell when it’s $400
"Shorts trying to bring it down under 320 before market close. Option expire now, hold above 320 would be important for a bigger squeeze on monday!"
Robinhood is scared. Only allowing one share of GME to be purchased. Get on board while you can
"LETS MOOOON HOLD. REMOVE your 420 Sell limits! OR Increase it to 10,000 or above!"
"While I support the effort to take down those who destroy companies by shorting stock and/or diseminating misinformation or lies, the real losers of what you are doing are the market makers. They are the ones you are hurting and that will hurt the market. I agree with @MarkA that the government does not enforce its own laws and policies for the big boys and hope this brings change. But what you are doing is no better. You are buying options on non-existent stock. This could be done on any stock, whether there is a short position or not. You do realize that, right? If you do, then you realize you have opened Pandora's box and could possibly destroy the investment markets. What you do is not investing but manipulation, just like the big boys. But I guess you figure two wrongs make a right. Reap what you have sown. Eventually somone on YOUR team is going to be left holding the bad and will not be happy with the losses, just like you saw yesterday. As my father taught me, for every problem there is an answer that is simple, obvious, and wrong."
We are not moving to AMC. This is it between shorts
"There is a new terminology in the market for anything that can be short squeezed ""Game Stopped"" :)!"
I think robin hood took a bribe.. liquidated peoples sales and closed shop..
Lets go $1000!
Open in U.S. today over $500?!
HODL THE LINES BOIS!
I have $500 in buying power on RH. Was gunna buy a share of GME but when I press buy it says I only have $256 buying power...... ummm??? N no fractional shares are being sold so #$%$ is going on
RH turned its bread and butter customers into bag holders. They must pay.
Will the short covering result in the price decreasing or does this provide an upward momentum on the stock?
Do not sell the shares. infinite short incoming next week
"I've never been so stress in my life. I thought after the closing at 193.60; I could walk away from all this thing. I'm back after a lunch break only to find this stock back up to 333.00! Ok, I'm still holding. I'm just going to have to call it a day and check back in the morning, so I don't lose my mind. It can't continue like. I'm placing a limit order to short some more shares if it hits 400.00. I have to try to make some of my money back. I am not going to start the year like this."
Lets go ....320
"Now The shorts can only buy back 1 share at a time per trade on GME mega Gamma short Squeeze is going to occur causing a flash crash with hedgers having to sell off other high flyers This Gamma Squeeeze is forecasted to cost Hedge shorters over 300 billion yes 300,000,000,000this is causing the hedgers to sell off high flyers like ZOOM Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA NFLX AMZN GOOG AAPL FB BITCOIN BTC causing flash crash between 3:00-4:00 look out below!.,"
Bought 200 at $400 this morning. Can anyone provide a sharp instrument and a biological map of the jugular vein? Thanks in advance.
"Rally but tomorrow, those who missed out today due the restrictions will get their chance tomorrow.Stick together and make these shorts cry.They will have their day as this eventually has to come back downs but TOMORROW IS NOT THEIR DAY, IT?S OURS!!!Worldwide attention, worldwide support to show Wall Street and the SEC we are done with the constant big hedge fund manipulation with Impunity. Market the market fair and equal to all and fry those who spread #$%$ information to manipulate a stock for the benefit of their short position like Citron.I like this stock! Strength in numbers!!"
"This will hit $2,000 next week"
once the hedge funds are force to buy the stocks it will go even more higher ..
"At Robinhood, we believe the financial system should be built to work for everyone. That’s why we create products that let you start investing at your own pace, on your own terms. LOL"
"The SEC issues warning as the war continues? Where are they with the Short and Distort crowd such as Street Sweeper or Citron or even the more famous ones who like to screw with each other? These clowns cost small mom and pop investors their entire livelihoods sometimes and many times based on speculation or conjecture that has no substance or proof to back it up. This merely proves something that we have all known for a long time, the SEC is a complicit pawn of the Uber Wealthy and their hedge funds. Wonder why Bernie Madoff was the chairman of the SEC prior to creating the world's largest Ponzi scheme in history at the time that it happened, stole the money from a lot of families."
SO MANY PEOPLE BUYING TOMORROW WILL EXPLODE!!!CYA
I like the stockMy girlfriend likes the stockMy Gf’s boyfriend like the stockWe hold the line. Staying here and not sellingGood job today peepsTomorrow is when it starts. How are your hands Mine are rock hard diamonds 
"I told you guys yesterday that the left leaning big tech, the corporate democrats & the left wing media were not backing the people, they were backing the 1%. They’ve been calling WSB “white supremacist” on the news/social media, news outlet were victimizing hedge funds as if WSB did something wrong, WSB was deplatformed on discord etc thus creating the perfect excuse for robinhood to prevent regular folks from doing what the people they are protecting been doing since the market existed."
Wait until AH...not enough shares available to cover. Bloomberg is talking to hedge funds...they don't know what to do.
Imaging selling at under 1000
Options assignment and delivery on 9.1mm shares is going to be interesting. Same with a bunch of RH accounts paying the exercise price.Keep some dry powder and don't be surprised to see some wild swings.Or let's just end this nonsense. The banks and hedge funds need to sit down with the GME board this weekend and figure out a follow-on offering.
"Roninhood now allow the purchase of GME, again. This should be good."
Bought more
"There is a rumor going around that Citadel (short seller hedge fund) owns Robinhood and that is what led to Robinhood shutting down GME buys today. I found this and thought it was interesting, so I am sharing with all of you:‘Does Citadel Own Robinhood?While social media followed the $GME story on Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, a different version made its way through financial news outlets and cable business news shows.That excerpted article from the Wall Street Journal on January 25 2021 — two days before Melvin Capital told CNBC it closed out its short position — indicated that Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management provided an “emergency influx of cash” to prop up the “hard-hit” firm (which the paper maintained “had a significant reservoir of goodwill remaining.”)The Verge clarified at least part of the business relationship between Robinhood and Citadel:What does Robinhood have to do with this? Well, it makes options trading much more accessible to retail investors — but there’s something else. Trades on Robinhood are free! But Robinhood isn’t offering free trades to be nice; the company gets paid by some big-time investors such as Citadel Securities to see what retail investors are doing. This phenomenon, which other brokerages are engaged in as well, is called payment for order flow. Citadel Securities makes its money on these orders by “automatically taking the other side of the order, then returning to the market to flip the trade. It pockets the difference between the price to buy and sell, known as the spread,” according to the Financial Times.A relatively new Wikipedia page (“GameStop Short Squeeze”) included a section titled “Market Manipulation Allegations,” touching upon Robinhood’s relationship with Citadel Securities:Bloomberg previously reported that 40% of Robinhood’s revenues were derived from selling customer orders to firms such as Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities. Citadel Securities was fined $700,000 in July 2020 for trading ahead of customer orders. They delayed certain equity orders from clients to buy or sell shares while continuing to trade the same stocks in its own account, as part of its market-making activities, according to FINRA. Over a two-year period until September 2014, hundreds of thousands of large OTC orders were removed from its automated trading processes, rendering the orders “inactive” and so they had to be handled manually by human traders. Citadel Securities then “traded for its own account on the same side of the market at prices that would have satisfied the orders,” without immediately filling the inactive orders at the same or better prices as required by FINRA rules. In September 2020, Robinhood was probed by the SEC into whether they properly informed clients that they sold stock orders to high-frequency trader and other Wall Street firms.A linked entry for Citadel LLC (mentioned by name in the WSJ piece) did not mention any ownership of Robinhood (nor even the company’s business with the app), and explained the structure of Citadel LLC:Citadel LLC (formerly known as Citadel Investment Group, LLC) is an American multinational hedge fund and financial services company. Founded in 1990 by Kenneth Griffin, the company operates two primary businesses: Citadel, one of the world’s largest alternative asset managers with more than US$35 billion in assets under management (as of October 1, 2020); and Citadel Securities, one of the leading market makers in the world, whose trading products include equities, equity options, and interest rate swaps for retail and institutional clients.Assertions Citadel LLC “owned” Robinhood were untrue, but rooted in a more complicated question of on which side Robinhood’s bread was buttered.“https://www.truthorfiction.com/does-citadel-own-robinhood/"
"Robinhood, is effectively joined at the hip with hedge fund Citadel, which in turn is a part owner of Melvin Capital which was destroyed by the short squeeze that Robinhood banned, so a clear conflict of interest), and one which sent GME stock as low as $112 after trading at $500 just hours earlier.SEC is as criminal as Wall Street. They have been watching Wall Street Manipulation go hyper mode for 50 years. Big Wall Street trading arms profit in the ons of billions quarterly with one having a losing quarter once every 5 years. GME is exposing the game."
I have 20 shares at 370$ not selling
Here's an interesting scenario. GME decides to issue stock to pay off its debt. What investor would pay more than $15 for those shares? Even that price is a rich valuation for a company losing money.
we can do this again.. push push push... $450+ not that far away...we hit above 450 earlier this morning..
bought 4 to support 
It will be interesting to see whether the little guys will be able to hold the price up when the end of day option manipulation begins. Good luck to longs.
SHORTS - Give up. We’re better at this than you. That’s why we’re here.
THAT DIP WAS A GIFT THANK YOU
"As in reddit we said...all.we have to do its hold, they are praying for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. SHORTS are hoping that they can make back their money at our expense, because every single day that they hold their short positions is costing them billion of dollars collectively. All we need to do its hold , we will cost them so much money today if we hold. Next week will be the SQUEEZE"
Andrew Left wants to make sure we pay taxes on the money we took out of his pocket... what a great guy.
Let’s do this...we are already writing history here folks
DONT FORGET. THIS STOCK IS SHORTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER! THEY HAVE TO BUY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS FROM US. WE SHOULDNT TRY TO GIVE THEM 1!!!!
back to 420.69 let's gooooo
keep above 115 and call options will be exercised
That is why I use Etrade and Fideilty.I did sell half at 450 but added at 200 after hour..Made 1.2M.. and let the free money go.
"If 54 million GME shares exist, then all it takes is each person to hold 1-10 shares and that implodes the shorts.After buying, set the Sell order to $100,000 - Good Til Cancel."
$600 before 10AMFact!
Do not sell!!! Revolution has begun!
"Don’t worry, as each day passes, these bag holder will realized the price will never go past $600 and there is no squeeze will lose hope and lose heart! As price go lower and lower they will sell."
They're restricting GME trades ONLY because their 1% buddies own short positions. But every day they allow market makers to manipulate retail traders. We need a new head of the SEC!
Schwab is allowing AMC and GME buying. Switch your account to them
"The volume is extremely low right now, this is a short ladder attack (manipulation) from big hedge funds. Everybody on WSB knows this already so don’t let this mf’ers scare you in to selling this is exactly what they want. If you’ve been watching closely the last few days you have seen this kind of rapid drops followed by sharp upwards movement. HOLD the line and you’ll be fine. Remember they have to pay HUGE interest every day they hold a short position. We have to pay NOTHING extra. Let these hedge funds bleed. These are the persons who orchestrated the whole 2008 crisis and WE all had to pay the price while they didn’t break a sweat. This is more than money this is a big middle finger to the establishment. Make sure to be a part of it."
"HOLD BABY HOLD, GO GO !"
God bless you guys. I hope you bankrupt Melvin Capital and Steve Cohen. You could save the world if you could take out George Soros.
"I feel like a black hole has opened up inside the markets that could suck everything inside into oblivion, like in a sci-fi movie. I don't even understand the magnitude of the lossed that the shorts will suffer if GME keeps going higher and higher. Is is even mathematically possible to unwind these short positions in any reasonable amount of time, given that all of these options contracts are coming due today? If the losses of the shorts are infinite, then could not all kinds of other people start going bankrupt, like the clearinghouses, Citadel, etc.?"
"So business fundamentals, revenue, business growth, projections, etc. no longer matter?"
THIS IS THE FINALSTAND BROTHERS
"If you haven't yet bought, buy atleast one share!! "

Look at what diamond hands have gotten us so far. To the moon we go 
Keep it over $300 today.....
bought more. they have to pay me at least 5000$ each to take it from me
"hold until 10,000"
"So based on all of this buying and selling activity, GME will then become a viable company that makes money and people should invest it? Ain't gonna happen lemmings"
When a company sells retail investors trade data to short sellers but then cost their clients billions they halt trading. When you don’t pay you are the product..
"Etrade blocked $AMC from buying, online it says call 1-800-etrade to place order. I called and automated reply says can't buy $AMC, $GME."

"FYI - Interactive Brokers are sending messages to clients stating that they did not restrict accounts yesterday. A lot of double talk. They allowed positions to be closed, but no new positions could be entered. So accounts were restricted. Interactive Brokers are lying, which makes me believe they are scared of class action. Interesting that there would be no record of a trade being entered and not accepted. I had this happen both in my IB account and TD Ameritrade multiple times on Thursday, but there is no record. TD Ameritrade was restricted today also from opening any new positions."

If your trading platform put restrictions on you trading GME or any other stocks during last few days. Its time for you to take your business elsewhere!!!!! Because YOU CAN
":-) if I do not sell, they cannot cover. If they have to cover, they must accept my price. But I am not selling ...hmmm supply versus demand...I have set the selling order for $10,000 a share ...if you do not buy from me... buy from somebody else to cover :-)Out of money? Sell mets..."

Just got in with 19 shares
"The daily volume has dropped significantly since Monday and last week. not just because of the Thursday restrictions, but Weds had much lighter volume. ??"
All those comments about GME tanking and ‘you’d better sell now’ didn’t age well.
Futures are VERY RED and GME weekly call options expire tomorrow. GME goes below $100 Friday.
CNBC and their short selling buddies are to blame for all this mess that is going on right now with Gamestop. CNBC has a reputation of interviewing short sellers and pretty much short sellers only. Shame on you Robin Hood or halting the game stock shares.
Not going to lie I was scared for a bit but held strong. It is worth it : )
Robinhood has opened up $GME and $AMC again. $GME and $AMC are both up ~75% since close already. If you want a quick turnaround that's where the play today will be.To understand why these are going up you need to appreciate the power of a large group of retail against the monster hedge funds. Ape stronger together.
Still a ton of shorts in this. hold to 1000.Next week will be fun $AMC and $VIVE too
"Wallstreetbets WSB talking about how big banks have been manipulating gold and silver miners for decades. Selling paper gold & silver to offset the price. STOP gold and silver price suppression by bullion bank practises, short selling in order to drive down the price is not fair & should be banned now.Suppression of the gold & silver price is not just a conspiracy theory. It's a well-documented phenomenon, with real actors and real ramifications. The FED has little room to manipulate interest rates and the market is beginning to realize that this is the end of the manipulation of gold and silver. With the removal of the uptick rule, banks and big institutions could short the gold and silver markets without the ability of buyers to get out of a position. By selling short on the paper market, price discovery got skewed far below where the real price should have been. GLTA Hope we will see free and fair market prices one day in precious metals stocks like $AG $PAAS $MAG $FSM $EXK Barrick $GOLD $GPL $NEW $MUX $AEM and many more ... power2thepeople, GLTA united forces with $GME $NAKD $BB $AMC ..."
Hedge funds selling quality names today to cover shorts on short squeeze companies. Time to buy quality companies that make money!

"In case you didn't know... Citadel, the big GME short supporter, handles Robinhood trading orders.How interesting.""Hedge fund Citadel Securities, which handles order flow from Robinhood and also injected money in to Melvin Capital when it was stuck on the wrong side of the GameStop trade, said today it was not involved in any decision to halt trading in stocks."""
Halted again?
I can’t find the shorting amount for GME. Is there a lot today
what part of HOLD are people not getting????
"I don't understand. People are willingly handing their money to hedge fund managers and banks by buying stocks at inflated prices. If they are lucky they might profit from another retail investor, but someone is going to lose, and it won't be the banks. They have the inside information they need to monitor and evaluate what people are thinking. They can turn the market on and off at will. They will respond as needed to ensure they stay solvent."
BB needs help!! We are trying to hold above $15 to deny shorts and just barely hanging on :(. Help if u can. BB is a good company and has a lot of new tech coming!!

"Imagine what would happen if all shorts were banned? It would create huge moral hazard. CEO’s would stop caring about their companies, about making better products, delivering efficiencies, innovating. They would simply get in bed with bankers and pump their stocks no matter how bad their companies perform. Hedge funds play an important role of a keeping senior management in check, policing their behaviour, motivating them to make decisions that benefit the economy, not just shareholders. Hedge funds were re-introduced for that important purpose. If you wish to get rid of them, think twice if that’s what you really want. It may not be as good as you think."
Who here believes that the actual GameStop business is a good business and one that has a bright future?
Who is holding into the weekend?
Hold! I made the mistake of selling off too early 2 days ago. Leaned my lesson. Hold it!
"Math works, HOLD"
Why aren't more people reviewing robinhood on app store giving it 1 star. Change your rating to 1 star
Remember to set your sell orders on $GME @1000 and $AMC @100

that Elon Musk tweet tho
"Dave Portnoy: ""PRISON TIME. Dems and Republicans haven’t agreed on 1 issue till this. That’s how blatant, illegal, unfathomable today’s events are. It also shows how untouchable @RobinhoodApp @StevenACohen2C Citadel Point72 all think they are. Fines aren’t enough. Prison or bust."""
"This is such a good real world demonstration of the fact that stock prices are really based on the perceived potential price of the STOCKs, not the underlying companies. These guys recognized that the shorts had badly oversold and as a result, the potential price of the GME stock would be high. Same thing as a large number of market stocks trading at high PE's, just greatly magnified. I'd like to see the SEC ban naked shorts, and probably the feds should put a 25% special tax on short sales profits to discourage the practice."

Would be nice to see the facial expressions at some of these hedge funds.
I hope those shorting this stock will soon get burnt like $GME shorts. Your time is coming!

"Weak AH wallstreet, nice try!"
"The broker's action was really unfair. At least, they should give a couple day's warning"
"Well, well, well. Looks like all the rebels are learning the hard reality of the ""too good be true"" opportunity. AMC down 60%, GME down 40%. Which means anyone who added our bought at these level is getting creamed. Once the high fever breaks, the temperature precipitously drops and trust me, these stocks will NEVER see the levels they just came down from. I lived through the 2000 tech bubble implosion and saw people lose real money they were counting on to keep them afloat who never recovered."
There are virtually no shares available in the market to buy you guys. Shorts are going to have to buy 22M tomorrow. This is literally going to blow up financial institutions. Just hold strong.
Gamma squeezer depend on our influencer supporter heavily now (My conspiracy theory says they meeting their personal goal) If they don't speak up people will eventually give up and wall street big boys bailed out.Ask them to stand with you. They are reason stock gone so high and they have to back us against establishment. They have power to do that. And even if they lose billions it's just number for them.Everyone need to ask them. Nothing wrong trying. We aren't asking to manipulate. If asking support is manipulation than everyone in wall street should in jail.

"Hey if there’s a short on here who wants my shares, I’ll sell them to you do $100,000 each. LMK."
The great thing about the “free” market is that it’s the most accurate indicator of a price at any given time.
"Was literally doubting this stock last night .. I’m convinced this is going to skyrocket, showing a lot of strength! Had to throw 1.5k this morning!"
"Wall Street is going to keep trying to convince people that retail cash longs are selling by redeeming ETFs and selling shares that look like cash (rather than the shorts they basically kinda sorta are). There will be continued bear raids.Just relax and buy the dip.We've got more dry powder.At some point, even if all shorts somehow cover despite it seeming like every retail long isn't selling until $1000, there will be a retail-funded follow-on issuance anyway, which will dramatically change the fundamental narrative.Having a dedicated investor and customer base-- and actually going out and raising $5B dramatically changes the fundamentals of this stock. That and the F Wall Street Buy America message helps."

(""Xunpusen"") in the second half of 2020.Revenues for the period do not include contributions from the recently announced acquisition of 51% of Fuzhou Csfctech Co., Ltd. and its two subsidiaries.The Company anticipates releasing its fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results in March 2021.Management CommentaryMr. Xiaodong Chen, CEO of Blue Hat, stated, ""We are pleased with the top-line growth achieved during the 2020 fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by revenues from our strategic acquisition of Xunpusen, which has set a strong foundation for us to be able to execute an effective sales and marketing strategy for our AR, education, and mobile game products by leveraging their expertise in enterprise software solutions and mobile sales to promote products directly to customers. Xunpusen's partnership with China Mobile, announced in November of last year, will serve to increase these sales channels and strengthen Blue Hat's brand as a recognized leader in interactive entertainment and education technologies and implementation.""Mr. Chen continued,"

"Stock market should not be a gambling ground. It is to invest in companies in order to participate in distribution of those companies’ profits that come from good business models. Share appreciation should be driven by fundamentals of the company leading to higher profits to be shared with shareholders in the future. Money losing companies should be penalized by lower prices which would prompt company management to work harder to deliver better performance. What we are seeing now is mindless gambling. Bankrupt companies see their prices skyrocketing while good companies are left if the dust. This is not sustainable. Every day gamblers have to make bigger bets to keep the party going, margin debts are skyrocketing as fast as the prices of bankrupt companies. One small mistake and the whole pyramid will start coming down fast."
"Sharing: Repost from Mr wolf, very important message : “Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying. Short positions have went up here drastically which means they are banking on a crash but if you as an individual investor, hold together with many other like minded investors.. we can not lose. Keep fighting the good fight. Cheers. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC and many more”"
What you hold is gold. Don’t let them take it from you like so many times before. They don’t know what’s best for us.

We can name the price if the stock squeezes. So 2K+ a share is possible. Also the squeeze probably won't happen today SO HOLD OVER THE WEEKEND.
"Brokers are not obligated in anyway to loan you their margin cash to gamble with super high risk stocks! There is no judge in the world who will disagree with this! I would loan you ZERO dollars to trade this! Pure gambling, not investing!"
"GME margin usage removal is same thing as taking away billions from investor and forcing to sell at any price.While I understand margin is very risky and I support higher margin requirement, There should rule for 15 day warning.Also Regulator must make sure that they don't give lower margin requirement, I think lowest allowed should be above 50% may be even 65%. This is case for both retail investor and big boys. No one should break that rule."
Was just at $370. You selling for crumbs smh
Regarding GME: Short interest is now 11.20Billion; shares Shorted = 57.83 Billion;Short interest % Float 113.31%;S3 SI % of float is 53.12% which includes the “synthetic longs” created by short selling in the calculation.Copy and pasted from Reddit WSB.
"Think about it this way, if we all agree to do the same thing and hold, we are pretty much creating our own hedge fund pushing in the direction WE WANT. if we just all collectively target the correct stock (heavily shorted ones, one at a time), we are bound to push forward and make gains on ANY HEAVILY SHORTED STOCK. that's what I see as the zenith of this whole thing, but if only all you guys can JUST LISTEN AND HOLD!!!!"
WE HAVE NOT WON TODAY IS THE BATTLE 1000 LETS FINISH IT!!!
"To WSB crowd, if you are serious about this company and really want to squeeze, call your brokers and get paper certificates on as many shares as you are comfortable (remove them from float) and keep holding."
"Just dont sell. Its as easy as that. The fat cats cannot cover their short positions if nobody is selling. We will burn them to the ground. This will be an epic win for the common if we stay strong together. Do not sell! Not at $420.69, not at $1000 nor at $5000."
Musk can get back at the shorts with small investment on his part; a loan or direct stock offering $200 millions Gme would work on e-commerce and cloud for gaming Many short funds would lose and GME would help sustain many families keeping their jobs

"Guys,While happy trading with $GME, we have two potential play for short squeeze. First is oil play $CPE - 9mm shares shor that is almost all the float.

I bought even more shares(1000 more) at the dip to 207ish. Im holding until these shares are $5000+ EACH! Not even joking. Melvin and the shorters will have a infinite loss potential!

Brokerage firms are restricting the purchase of GME shares to CASH only. You cannot buy GME on margin. That is the why the price is stable

"Apparently there is a workaround on share buy limits. Buy a deep deep itm call option for feb 5 like a 45 call, exercise it immediately for the essentially the same price (you lose a couple cents). Magic you now have 100 shares that your  can hold until you can hand deliver it to Elon on Mars. "

"Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and #$%$ retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants#$%$ fear.Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6oIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today."

"APPARENTLY THEY HAVE BROUGHT OUT A NEW WEAPON/EXCUSE CALLED VOLATILITY.UNDER THE PRETEXT OF VOLATILITY, THEY CAN DO ANYTHING TO OUR STOCKS/OPTOONS/ACCOUNTS, BAR US FROM TRADING, CLOSE THE MARKET AND MANIPULATE INTERNALLY.I REPEAT, ANYTHINGGGGG!!!!THIS IS CORRUPTION AT ITS GREATEST. NAKED CORRUPTION, THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCEALING IT.$GME $AMC $NAKD $BB $BBYL $AAL $KOSS $EXPR"
"I'm owning for a trade but that's it. I plan to sell next week. I know I'm going to get lots of thumbs down for this but long term things don't end well for this name, AMC, BBBY, etc. This not a long term buy like TSLA or SHOP. It's business model is unsustainable, its fundamentals are poor, and its long term future bleak as a brick and mortar retailer. Anyone who can't see that will be left without a penny of what they invested. So I will sell next week and transfer to the sidelines. I am not shorting however. When the party ends is anybody's guess but all I know is there is a sanity check coming for the market in names like GME."
KEEP HOLDING AND BUYING WE MADE THE NEWS FOR A REASON WE ARE STRONG
I closed my Robinhood account if they don't play fair.i will not use them
"They shut down the buying of GME so the fund managers could close their short positions at the lowest price possible, now it’s surging back up after the shorts covered"
"Only joined the party recently and paid some premium price for the shares. It's not about the money anymore, it's about a movement and being part of history on the making. HOLD!!!!"
"I will probably loose money, bought in yesterday about noon for $414. Only bought one share, so not a big deal, but it's all I can afford to buy/loose whichever the way the wind blows. I will hold on to it. This is a fascinating phenomenon. I have never seen it happen. I am proud to be a part of it, even in a small way."
"A few more days of this, and $GME will be able to buy out $GM in a stock transaction!$F $CLF"
korean brokerage shinhan- investment restricted all GME stock. now people are so angry
"CSLT shares traded almost 1 million shares in the after market on Friday after the stock significantly reversed Friday afternoon to close up 10% and 4 million shares trading volume. Typically CSLT trades approx. 1 million shares.The enthusiasm for CSLT shares may be driven by a post from CSLT’s twitter feed where they are introducing a new In-App product for navigation to COVID vaccines. (A weblink to the article is below).CSLT has also partnered with the U.S. Center of Disease Control (CDC) and Boston Children's Hospital to develop a vaccine finder for COVID vaccines, which will be released to the public in February. As I understand it, CSLT is being paid by Boston Children’s Hospital as CSLT is a subcontractor and Boston Children’s Hospital is being paid by the U.S. Center of Disease Control.Given that recent studies found that 6 in 10 Americans do not know when or where to get a COVID vaccine, CSLT’s in-app vaccine finder solution is likely to be very important towards ending the COVID pandemic. In March, CSLT partnered with Google, NY State and several others to provide a Covid Test Site finder. CSLT was not paid in March to create the COVID test site finder, but CSLT is getting revenue for the COVID VaccineFinder.Because of the extra revenue from COVID VaccineFinder in 2021, I expect CSLT to provide better quarterly results and financial guidance than expected when CSLT reports earnings in late February, 2021.I think CSLT shares are worth $5+ as the company has a approx. $200 million market cap and its nearest digital health competitor (which is recent IPO ticker ACCD) has a $2.5 billion market cap and both companies have similar amounts of revenue.Other peer digital health companies include $AMWL $TDOC $GDRXhttps://www.castlighthealth.com/2021/01/29/introducing-castlights-in-app-covid-19-vaccine-navigation/$GME $AMC $BBBY $BB $EXPR"

Don’t forget about BlackBerry!People keep saying “all these stocks are so overvalued”. BlackBerry is still very undervalued and has long term growth ahead. Partnership with Amazon. Settlement from Facebook
"Next week will be interesting. Still a lot of shares short and most importantly there is a ton of Feb, March, April, June Sept, ect contracts that are deep in the money. In addition people have been sending money in mass to accounts that are not going to restrict access to buying the actual common stock. This would have been at 500 plus if they didn't pull some of those completely illegal maneuvers. Lastly these people are going to go in a frenzy over the weekend about buying this stock on Monday when money hits their accounts. The hate for the Hedge funds will be at a fever pitch next week. I am still holding and completely enjoy this stock as it's excitement level is off the charts"
Keep this above 320..... this will rocket Monday
"I'm totally stoked for the little guys here. Citron has done people wrong for years, along with other Hedgies that only tell partial truths to drive down prices. No skin in your game but best of luck to all."
$gme keep buying SNDL this is going to break to go up. We can do this.
"1) The price of US oil has turned negativee for the first time in history. . BBC Apr 20, 2020.2) Negative-yielding bonds are bonds that cause bondholders to lose money when they mature.3) Negative stock holding anyone? Can GME stock be the first in history?Every thing is possible."
Citroen quit short selling cause their clients were demanding refunds!Fact!
sold all my NIO stock and just bought gamestop
"Millions of traders can't even buy at the moment and we still hold this. AWESOME!Just wait for the squeeze tomorrow and those 140% of shorted shares have to get bought. They underestimate our knowledge about the Market. They did those tactics for years, but this time we know it and dont fall for it.HOOLD"
Can anyone link me the video of Cramer screaming I LIKE THE STOCKS with the rocket? I lost it but I must revisit it
I tried to exercise my options to get the shares from them. It's been hours and still hasn't found the shares needed. HOLD GUYS!!!! There's really no shares available out there. The squeeze is just getting started.
"You also need to set your shares to be sold. Set limit sell orders at 1,000"
"I always wondered how Americans were able to defeat the british for independence. Well, they never F give up? How can you lose if you keep fighting?"
Hold the phone squeeze is coming threw
Lets make a world record today guys
we are young but we are making history.
knowing what's happened with GME. what happens with AMD next week since it's on the most shorted list?
Some people don’t seem to understand a market. Who are you selling the stock to if the brokerages are only allowing selling and not buying?
“Hold the line” so close to infinity!
As this spreads to more stocks the GME mania will fade.
really wrong what robinhood did to all of you today. move your money out of RobinHood quickly before they can use you to go public. use your power and WALK!
Thought shorts had to cover today. Or are there all new shorts that cover next week ?
See you in 8 hours when numbers start moving again
I lost 7k yesterday we can't let this go like yesterday
"The irony of platforms saying they paused trading to protect investors, while that in and of itself prevents the price rising, contributing to this fall and hurting the retail investors"
