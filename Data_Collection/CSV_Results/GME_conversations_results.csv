Recent headlines and conversations for GME

A $4 stock is trading at $90 and people are acting like WSB lost.
Hold that shares if you want to be rich.
Still in @ $480?
Keep on buying traders!!! don’t lose steam ! proof to all the hedge fund traders u r heroes and prepared to lose everything
are we still holding
"All the people who said they shorted at $400+ are lying. I tried to short at $400 but no broker had shares to borrow - Etrade, Schwab, Merrill Edge, TD. None!"
"If Justin Sun crypto billionaire has just bought 10 mil worth of shares , where is this going"
"Anyone still have their account at Robin-, I mean Nottingham Sheriff trade? Btw., GME has no future and negative operating cash flow as far as the eye can see. Who goes to malls and who doesn't download games or play on hosted servers?"
Party is over
"Make those shorts cover, go get em boys and girls. Remember, pull your funds from Robinhood."
Welcome new bagholders! Nothing like buying at $80 followed by a 25% whacking in the same day. Enjoy! WSB....To The MOON! LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Going up again.. $400 may be on the way .....
PBOC says they cover GME shorts another week but at higher rates!
$GME $AMC $SNDL let’s blast off boys come on!!!!!  
"They say the guys in NY messed with the system. Well guess what it is their system.You walked into their house and took a dump on the floor.You spoke of honor, took profits, but let people hold.The damage you have done to the retail investors (no the retail gamblers) will far out weigh the damage you have inflicted upon wall street.The leaders of WSB need to come out and tell the peons that the hold is over and that they are bag holders.You speak of honor and noble intent but I see neither."
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layba1/mark_cuban_said_to_hold_so_we_hold/
"Robinhood drew down its credit lines and got a $1 billion cash injection from investors. But even that tidy sum was really only enough to cover what had transacted to that point. If Robinhood customers were going to keep buying GameStop at higher and higher prices, Robinhood would have to fork over billions more to, by that point, a completely freaked-out DTCC.There were no more billions to be had, at least not easily, so Robinhood threw cold water on the party; they simply stopped customers from buying any more GameStop shares. There was no problem selling your shares, but you couldn't buy for love or money.Ultimately, there was no sinister ""one hand washes the other""-style conspiracy to save floundering hedge funds; there was no secret bargain to deny retail and day traders the chance to make a, frankly, well-deserved killing. After all, the Redditors, the day traders, the ""little guys"" were really only doing what hedge funds themselves do all day long."
HEAVY SHORT INTEREST - GET IN NOW
Anyone buying at the open?
Added to NSYE short sale restriction list. NO MORE SHORT SELLING.
I am holding 100 shares @250. Should I put more money in it to average it down? Please serious answers....
"The hedge fund that make 700 millions from GME, like to said thank you to all the small investors."
It's will. Close at 80
So much for Mark Cuban saying to hold.
$95 is nothing!
Lot of bashers from this past week now using the same accounts to pretend they’re previous investors who have sold and regret buying GME. Don’t fall for it and ignore the manipulation. HOLDing the line!
big news coming at the weekend...opens Monday at 450
"The concept of a ‘short ladder attack’ is just another iteration of the false conspiracy theories about how the few billions of dollars of capital focused on short selling somehow controls markets containing trillions of dollars of capital focused on long buying,” he said via email Wednesday. “Put it up there with California wildfires are started by space lasers.”"
"People are waking up to the corruption. You greedy shorts, corrupt hedgies and illegal bots have opened a lot of eyes. Your world of lies and corruption is starting to burn down. This is just the beginning"
Why people in this board are so happy of price fall?
"hey, a few shares at 64 ain't gonna hurt anyone. fun money"
"Maybe Musk himself is not going to buy any stock but he sure will make many people, among them extreme rich to buy it. Hedgefunds do not stand a chance, everybody knows it, it is only a matter of time. The combined $ power of Musk and his followers is not a power anyone with half a brain would dare fight against."
I hope you folks who are left holding the bag of this pump and dump take this experience to actually learn economics and how markets work. There are ways to earn money investing that do not include chasing animal spirits of teetering companies that will sooner rather than later be a victim of Herbert Stein's Law.
Looks like DFV is in some DFSheet? Read he's actually a securities broker posing as a moms basement bro?
Can someone explain to me how this will be beneficial for us in the long run? How would the price go back up to 800.00? Words of encouragement very much needed!
True short interest has dwindled to under 50%.. be weary
I’m not a gamer but I remembered when my step sons would have me take them there to buy the latest and greatest plus they could trade in the old stuff and either get money or a credit. With that being said maybe just maybe this company will be profitable and still be in business. GLTA wish you only the best.
Where are all the diamond hands now?? Too many paper hands dumping
Hedge funds are jumping ship and covering.
Robinhood = Robbing the hood !!!Anyone in the red and down money we are mostly in the same boat however its not a boat we will be sailing for long. What comes down always goes back up in the market and with the prices lowered it will entice more people to join in on a second ride up for us on gamestop and of course it will cause other stocks like $AMC and $KOSS $BB $BBBY $NOK $INO ect to finish their rides that were all stopped because of that foul action made by RH...
No shorts left. No squeeze coming. Just the bagholders selling to each other. It's done!
"ok I've been watching and waiting. Honest feedback, is it a good time or did I miss it?"
the party is over
Stop Halting the run!!
WOah game changer right here. It is DFV being 'detained' by police. Check it out on youtube right now here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnYBysK2eLE&t=15sEither very good or bad for us.
"This all started as a brilliant short squeeze that ended the day before the peak, because the shorts were covering. The problem is that people didn't know the rules, and the brokerages did not have the capital to handle the volume, just like in other wild market events. This became a classic pump when Chamath and Elon whipped up buying frenzy to deceive those who did not want to think for themselves. It became a dump when self serving guys with no skin in the game like Marc Cuban encouraged everyone to hold. The game comes to an end with Portnoy ""I'm smarter than Warren Buffet"" selling out at a major loss.  are what other people tell you to do so that they can get out and leave you as the bag holder. It is a con.The gamestop management were too stupid to issue shares when they had a once in a lifetime opportunity. Even the management in this company seem incompetent. Other companies with capital problems used the opportunity to raise capital and improve their operations (Tesla, anyone?).Take what is left and move on. You will have another chance in life. Yes, this dead cat may bounce, but it is not going back to where it was."
did it just hit 152?
"So what started short sequeeze? Media don't want to tell you true reason because that make this company worth more than it trading for sure.Short Sequeeze start after Jan 11 when they report great earning result and it jump. 309% eCommerce sale and already present 34%.Now with last week event, I really think this company have fighting chance to go back to $500 and not because short sequeeze but based on fundamental."
"When they realize they’re relying on a short squeeze to come that isn’t ever going to , it’s GAMEOVER"
"Cut your losses, learn from it and move on. Idk why some think they just have to hold forever. Learn from your mistake, make better trades. Holding on only keeps this tragic event current"
A word for the wise: don't get caught up in the hype do your due diligence when picking stocks and trading. Study charts-some are so predictable and some even can be right over 80 percent of the time. I will take those odds.
so if GME is the most shorted stock then the UPSIDE should be coming
"DFV just posted his shares on Reddit. If he can hold, you can too."
GameStop Appoints Chief Technology Officer ex Amazon AWS 
I told you yesterday to buy GME at pullback. I told also to buy AMZN and AAPL. buy 3 of these now. Diversify now...AMZN will break 3500 short squeeze is coming. AAPL squeeze to 150 today. GME 120 squeeze could happen any given time. Buy these 3. AMZN released solid earnings already. That's your security your safe haven. AMAZON sold a lot of games
"50$ 40$ puts expiring today seems to have gone out the window, 8.79% up pm momentum to 78 at noon with estimate close imo 85 close ,"
"Strong support above $98, this isn't going to budge and once the shorts have to cover it will rocket"
"Exactly one week ago GME reached a high of 483. Since then it has lost 90% of it's value. If you think GME will regain it's positive momentum, you need to call the gambling hot line at 800-522-4700."
Sooo. Green AH. I see
Any idea what the short ratio is. I looked on Fintel and GME is the only one that doesn't offer that information
Can we go below $50 already today? I sold my shares @63 and it would be only thing that would make me happy to know that I made right decision and saved 10 bucks
Sad to see the innocent uninformed lose so much money. Stock markets are not a game it is an investment. If your looking for a game go to your xbox.
"GME recovering a bit, today. Not sure if anyone is interested in Tofutti Brands, TOFB? Not much float at all so big investors can't really be involved, there, but smaller investors might be interested."
Hedge Fund's Proxies are so active down here in comment section! how much do you guys earn from commenting?
"Lets even the playing field we are a unit here fighting these hedge funds they are scared but we arent folding, only adding more to our bags haha"
Tomorrow $10
The poor shorts are going to be crying when this stock doesn’t drop like their “fundamentals” tell them it should
BUY YOUR GME NOW.. THE LAST TIME ELON TWEETED IT ROSE 100%... nows your 2nd chance!
KEEP SHORTING PLEASE
Today will be sideways with extreme sell pressure only thing they haven't tried
Way to push back up guys! Line is being held!Elon also tweeted again!
"Sell, sell, sell"
eps: -4 pps: 96 only a pe of -24 lol
"Anyone who is watching the people now running the government who voted for them, should be very disappointed at this point in time. It's called anti-Americanism and you get to live with it for the next few years until they are driven from office. America First, not Globalism!"
"just added at 59 bucks!!!dont sell, this is just like tsla, the guy invested 70 million, yea he got in at 16 a share but he did not buy the shares to only be worth 60 70 bucks!!common sense, at tops in few years this will be atleast $200 bucks!! im holding the bag but i can see the future!!its only a loss if you sell!!!"
The volume buying is rising to new highs my lads
I wouldn't want to hold over the weekend. It may crater on Monday!
AMC's got another pop in her. $GME $SNDL $NAKD these are my money makers right now.
Bought 1 share at 225 and sold it smartly at 350. Was fun while it lasted.
"RobinHood is allowing buys up to 100 shares now, I expect a nice bounceback today."
At least in a casino you get free drinks while the house takes your money.. LOL..
HOLD THE LINE SOLDIERS. HOLD THE LINE
Have the reddit folks figured out they can't corner the silver market? The Hunt brothers could have told them that years ago.
MOOOOONNN  DIAMOND HANDS!! 
"If you are still holding this with your 'diamond hands', sixty bucks a share is going to look like a score looking back in a few days time. I am not a shorter, I am a long term investor, but I also really do hate to see small investors being misled while others get rich. If you can get out at sixty, do yourself a favor by cutting your losses and licking your wounds. There is always another trade. GLTA and be safe!"
yesterday i bought at 113
Bullish on this company! Did you see who they have hired recently!??!  
Share prices reverting to actual market value. Who could have seen that coming?
POST YOUR GAINS / LOSSES HERE:
CLOSING out my positions that sell orderflow information to citidael at my brokers. I am moving all my assets from robinhood eventually and all brokers that sell order flow information.I will only use them for holding passive assets at most not for buying and selling anything.Bye orderflow sellers and I am removing gme from those platforms and bought more yesterday THANKS HF SHORT SUCKERS.
Yolo’d my last 3k into puts today I’m probably going to wake up with 10k Monday morning
I didn’t understand why they didn’t dilute at 400..anyone would have done that..they could have easily given 3B for the company and the company would exist forever..no they didn’t because if they did that the stock would have gone to 1000 ..
Now that we've seen the pump that happened with #GME maybe people will see the correlation with Tesla
We coming to rescue you brrrrrr 200-300
They don’t want us to win!!!!!
Imagine if RH didn't restrict trading all this time smh.
It's not as easy as you thought ... is it?
GREEN AHs
its moving again.
After hours activity bringing this into the 40's now.... Easy to see 30's tomorrow. This is indeed a hard lesson and hard to accept. But this will pass. Just find a winning stock with a low low price tag... and let it run it's course. You'll feel better in a few years.
GME & $AMC short manipulation! look @ ACRX *break-out* on Volume; ACRX 100% BarChart But rating! ACRX 525% upside per Yahoo Finance...
This is so low now. bargain for quick swing trade
200+ by the end of the trading day! 
EVERYONES A WINNER!!!The Reddit Groups said They wanted to Trigger a Short Squeeze and didn’t care if it took loosing every last cent to do it that “if” They Could get EYES on This They would be WINNERS.The Naked Shorts took a 15% Loss on This so They will be Careful going forward and They were able to Piggy Back Up with The Run Up and Reset Their Shorts and Shorted up in The $400’s so They are WINNERS.The Day Traders were able to make some BIG TRADES so They are WINNERS.You had HIGH PROFILE PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS like Myself on This Board & Others WARNING that GME as a Longterm Investment was NOT The Future and for LONGS & GME Insiders/Company to SELL at a HUGE PROFIT and Those that listened are HUGE WINNERS.Even Hollywood is going to make 2 Movies about this..... so Again WINNERS.EVERYONE GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED OUT OF THIS AND ARE ALL WINNERS. Now The Markets can get back to Normal and We can ALL look to Upcoming Earnings and take Advantage of some GREAT GROWTH BUY’s On This Market Dip to Continue With What Was Working so........ CONGRATULATIONS EVERYONE!!!! Time to Go Stealth for me and GREAT JOB AGAIN EVERYONE!!!!Robbie L Berger
The folks that bought in at over 350 ...  the pain y’all feeling rn
14% pre market increase. That's telling you something... might be a good day to HOLD
50k shares bought and holding
"Free fall begins (may stop at $13) as no more shorts to buy the dips for you! (TD Ameritrade, Robinhood and most other brokerage have banned its clients from sell short GME for more than a week."
Portnoy made all you buy just so he can sell his shares a couple days later. Lmaooooo the suits win again! this is $5 tomorrow. 
I am still in Can't  Won't  
Tip: NAKD
I come hear to read what the dead enders are posting. Are we going to $2000 today?
Guys the pattern is obvious! Stop chasing. Cash it out now! Buy a great company with a 10% dividend low float & low volume! Buy $GEL before it goes over $7 today!
Taking some of your gains and buying back in around 5 bucks could be a smart play... shorts will not learn lesson and this could happen again.
Can I now by shares on Robinhood again? Will this make GameStop go back up to $500?
"we were all trying to lose the most money possible in the least amount of time, right guys?....guys?"
"This will imo be at 100 shortly, I can’t believe what I’m seeing WOW"
"If you are diamond hands, atleast be smart and go make some profit somewhere else and come back here after the dip"
Under 30 next friday?
Who thinks $400 by tomorrow's close?
they can short all they want- there is enough Long investors for it togoup
Today WE'RE BACK!
Don’t worry kids. NASA is still trying to figure out how to get to the moon too.
The question is did Mark Cuban buy it himself?
"We have a bull flag! Don't panic buy. Let it slowly climb steadily, so we dont get shut down again."
they wanna short this back to zero even though theres no fundamentals that say a global brand with money in the bank should go bk. these are not job creators.
"If we sum up. What has a retail investor achieved by driving this stock up? Yes Melvin and Citron lost some money, but BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelty, Andy Cohen and the fat GME directors has got billions in profit. The average little guy who was caught in this frenzy has lost money. And more losses will come. By the end of the day, who won?"
And then they said “  hands”
Wall Street thanks you for your financial support btw
great time for new shorts to cover when the market opens
hold on if u can shorts getting higher N only 2.5 days to cover there trying keep it under a 100 a share don't let um
GME Stock Market Gurus....On F..B.... In my comment....

"Attention New Stock Market Pros!The stock market is not a socialist movement, Bernie Bros are not here looking to provide you with equal financial distribution.Its dog eat dog, your online hero's will clean you out financially quicker than you can say ""free health care and tuition""! LOL"
people selling at 99 I am trying to buy to hike the price.buy and to 300
% of $huya float shorted 36.85% according to market watch. I reckon we could pressure some of the shorties here too $gme $amc $bb
redditors held on or bought in over 400 because AOC tweeted. Then held on at last chance to get out with a pulse because Mark Cuban did an AMA. Did they learn anything?
If you can afford to leave your money in here I would hold if I were you. 226% short. They will have to spike this to cover.
Trade in your money for 1/5th of what it’s worth! Typical GameStop
Quit buying at these prices! lol... Wait for $10
Restrictions removed GME is a bargain. Also CEO is very good on business. This will surge again
The roaring kitty just posted on twitter! there is still hope!
Bloodbath
Momentum is definitely moving green
HALTED CAUSE WE GOIN UP
where are your loyal brothers and sisters now ???? running for the gates. money has no friends or loyalty. lol
According to new CEO's track. Proper value is $300. Buy at dip guys. Stock price is so cheap because of excessive short selling.
If you bought at the open today you’d be down 29%
"In the past month, shares of Nokia spiked from under $4 to as high as $9.79 before dropping back down to around $4.50 on Tuesday.ITS A TREND GME back to $10"
Janet likes this stock.
70 to the close and pm Monday 110.

How much y’all lost
Congrats to all the diamond hands who held the line 
Keep holding I am holding no matter what don't believe the doubters this is for Diamond handed true longs only!!! $AMC $GME
"Future is: $25 -30,, rests around $13"
"GME has been on the NYSE SHO list for 10 days now because of sellers failing to deliver their stocks (naked shorts). When a stock has been on this list for 13 consecutive settlement days, brokers can be forced to cover open shorts by buying the missing shares. GME has been on the list since January 19. The 13th consecutive day for GME would be Thursday, February 4. That means naked short positions could start being forced to buy and close positions on Friday. The NYSE SHO List: www.nyse.com/regulation/nyse/public-info When they’re inevitably forced to close these positions my personal prediction is that we’ll see a price of at least $600"
"What’s current short interest? Latest info, like from bloomberg terminal"
We are almost at the catalyst $69 share price after hrs boys. Truly is a sign greatness is coming in the coming week. Super Bowl Sunday followed by Big money Monday. As long as we believe anything is possible.
"Time to move the money to BB, which has good size short interest and strong fundamental and future support a much higher SP."
I'm gonna buy today. No way they can cover over 226% short without spiking this.
"The problem with WSB peeps is that they're hitting all sorts of stocks, like when H[]tler opened two fronts. If they focused only on a single stock, they could totally squeeze the shorts again easily. 2 million float + massive buying will force shorts to cover. Period. But they're too busy playing in other pump and dumps."
But I thought we all agreed not to sell
Game Flop ...
man i remember when there were like 3k people viewing this pre market
"I am late to the party but bullish NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of GameStop shares shorted edged higher as the video game retailer’s stock price tumbled on Tuesday, according to the latest data from analytics firm S3 Partners.The number of shares shorted was 26.39 million on Tuesday, up from 26.09 million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop’s short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $2.38 billion, according to S3."
GME has no legitimate business plan. They make no money. Look at their balance sheet
"Let's finish in the green, great time to enter the cause and HOLD!"
Don't say you weren't warned when your investment in GME loses 90%. It's a $15 stock and no more.TTM shows a loss of over $4/share.
Wsb had Cuban on this morning talking about holding and helping in other ways too.
$80+ close today$100-$150+ close next weekEnjoy the ride up! 
imagine blocking certain stocks from being purchased. if thats not manipulation and you guys aren't angry about it... I don't know what to say
It was a epic run but all things come to an end. There is nothing wrong with taking profits. I was given great advice the first time I hit it big=take your initial investment out of your profits and continue to play with house money. There is NOTHING worth then losing after you were up big.
I would bet this closes at 85.00. This has been closing on the dollar its so controlled.
"I kind of thought we already won when the thing hit almost 500? That’s not normal to send a 15 dollar sock soaring to 500 in 5 days?? lol but it’s got to end one day right? I took my winnings at the top but then decided to buy back, and that was my worst mistake I could’ve made. I lost a lot of money holding it the other until yesterday... and I sold my option first thing yesterday morning. I won’t speak of how much but was relieved I sold it right away in the morning, otherwise I would’ve lost it all. I think it’s done, and I think you’ve won. So don’t go back and lose."
GameStop appoints 3 new Executives to push forward e-commerce and customer focused transformation...Big news for the gme transformation.Includes AMAZON people.
I WOULD SELL BUT I CAN'T READ
"How ya holders doin? Lol, "
You would be better off investing in lottery tickets than this.
"Im thinking very seriously about buying 1000 shares in my ira tommorrow morning, in hopes this heads back to 100 + any reason why not"
I bought into this at around 350. Need that money for mortgage and car payments coming up. How soon till we get back to those levels do you think? I'm pretty new to all this investing stuff.
this time Robinhood won´t halt trading - SEC is watching
HOLD THE BAG!!!
49cents a share next week
Buy or hold!!!!!!
if it reach 30$ i might get half share just to look at gme and laugh about
HOLD. Over 226% short. They have to cover at some point.
buying the dip!!! I’ve been waiting for this
"Please, if you have suicidal thoughts because you've just burned your retirement fund or all of your savings for college, just reach out to suicide prevention hotline. The situation won't get better, act before complete mental breakdown."

In the meantime, I'll continue to get my connections to post negative news articles about these stocks and label all the retail investors as criminals and conspiracy theorists""."
You just have to hold. Even it is 50 cent.
"It is now safe to short until to $15, the mania passed, 100% dead cat."
Oh my. Do you all realize the shorts made a ton of money on the way down so what did your movement really do? Also the owners thank you for making themRich and digging themselves out of a hole. You all can go back to playing your Xbox now. You’re grounded.
the squeezees have yet to be squoze. catch these diamond hands bruh
What’s 40% of 90? Tune in tomorrow for the answer
Hedge Funds Lives Matter-china joe biden
"lol ""diamond hands"" still holding? "
Just bought 2 Gme at 113.50 let's see what happens. Let's gamble. I have money to lose but I hope I make money I lost some money on dayh trade today so trying to make up
"Citadel and billionaire Ken Griffin has made a mint off of Robinhood clients. Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Citadel LLC, a separate hedge fund also founded by Griffin, recently helped bail out Melvin Capital, a fund that sank 30 percent in a few weeks after shorting GameStop."
lesson for lifetime 
Boom!Somebody’s too smart! Somebody knows
GME halted @ 10:00 a.m. @ $82.77
Never selling >
Hahaha shorts are really sweating now 160-200 tomorrow remember;)
is there a wall on $73 ? jump over boi !
I guarantee you won't be losing $100 tomorrow. That's the good news.
"UNDER 30 tomorrow. FREE info; no donations requested. I TOLD you that it would be under 50 today. I was off by a few bucks. I may be off by a few bucks tomorrow, but I'll be CLOSE. GAME OVER for all but the Large Money Short sellers who have UNLIMITED capital."
I just bought in. I feel like I'm entitled to talk here now. Hello neighbors
"Guys please don't keep holding what you cannot afford to lose. Short interest IS down, whilst it's still squeezable know that shorts have repositioned to the 250 range. This means the stock needs to hit 300 BEFORE A SQUEEZE CAN START!Very dangerous territory, let reality sink in and good luck to all"
New target: $1000 a share....
Sideways then up
All are welcome to join the shuttle. We leave today. Pack up and get in.
Why fight hard for 10% when we can push a small cap 40x like $TSOI 
participation awards will be given as you exit
When you lost it all and can only reminisce those high spending habits.
Why they halt the stock on the way up??? Why??
"If you are still holding at this current moment, I have no more sympathy left for you. You saw the signs of a pyramid scheme yet you continued to recruit other members. I wish you nothing but sleepless nights and agony at this point. To all others, I am sorry for what you are going through but life is much more than your financials. Go for a walk outside, take a deep breath and be thankful for being alive."
The stock will squeeze again. There are even more people going short now. It may not squeeze as high time time but it will squeeze.
Lots of HUUUUUGE walls. Now we have one at 129.98
150 close and after hours 200++Let us do itThe funds will follow
"So pre-market, GME is up, but what if the hedgies are driving it up on propose, so the can sell their positions higher after the market opens, driving the market down? I never trust pre-market..."
Missed the first run? Maybe this is the second!
what will happen to those people who bought in at $510???
You guys longs shouldn't sell as you now own a very famous brand name.
BUY & HOLD today folks. We’re looking good. *not financial advice*
Am I the only one holding the bag?
Kiddies....Mommy is making hot chocolate to help you sleep better tonight. I'm sorry you had to learn such an expensive lesson. Truth is you have to work hard in this world and invest wisely to get ahead. I will make myself personally available for any of you that need guidance.
It’s over boys we tried
Bought at 445Will Sell at 15 in order to maximize my tax loss
Hedge funds made most of the money on the stock going up. Guess who is making lots of money on the stock going down?...
Over $300 today Hold on your shares
I didn’t hear no bell
Look at the block trades. Hedge funds are buying million share blocks to get retail to chase then shorting immediately thereafter. Sell at any spike.
I am buying 3000 shares tomorrow.
"it should be obvious by now, there are not enough diamond hands to support another squeeze at the 350-450 level. my goodness you diamond hands just gave so much money to short selling hedge funds, plus they got to ride up as well, in the end they made much more money than was lost, at the small guys expense...was that your goal?"
"This still has a long way to fall. Cash out, total loss is not the move."
400 was the bait.
"hopefully many got out . Need to get into short squeezes early. Hope it works out for All longs. Rooting for ya.Here are 3 new short squeezes I added today.1) HRTX : 100m in revenue / impressive for biotech.They have drugs for post chemotherapy pain, and several other. Already generating revenues. Not that it matters in short squeeze plays.So here is the real juice:25% short interest17,900,000 shares are short79m float .The average volume is about 1mm shares a day. That is a HUGE short position both % wise. And in actuality since the Volume average is about 1mm per day. I’m in it long term. But timing wise , I just missed DVAX, JNCE, VXRT.So I said .. there squeezing the biotechs hard now that retail squeeze ran its course .The stocks that already moved above .. AND HRTX- the common thread is BAKER BROTHERS.... most well repeated fund is among then largest shareholders... 2) GNW- genworth A leader in mortgage insurance and term life ins. With home mortgage refinance and purchases at record levels . Many are putting down less then 20% with higher home prices / appraisal values. With record low interest rates. Hone owners can afford the payments but don’t always have the 20% needed for down payment or equity % on refinance. To boot, they had a takeover offer form financial instit based in China . But genworth backed out do the deal as they feel they can get a better buyout price .. they just sold their Canadian MTG ins portfolio for $1BB. GNW market cap is only $1.6BB.They do 2BB in revenue . She they backed our of the deal the stock came down to $3 from just under $5. Shorts seizing the headline . Now they can negotiate a better deal, they have a cash hoard . Paid down debt and their revenues / EPS are in great spot with mortgages booming .Shorts have to cover . 15mn short 3) KGC- kinross gold.EPS up 100% each of last 2 years , and they expect 100% again for full year . When they report next week they are on pace to see 100% EPS forest for ‘2020, which is the 3yr in a row . 24m shares short, earnings next week. And the silver short squeeze rallyIs spilling into Gold now as well. Gold futures up 8-12 points I’m overnight session. Silver also in 4% overnight . KGC just dirt cheap at $7Trading 2x annual sales"

GME ....POWW.
Previously sold 50 puts 2/19 avg price of 40 if I get assigned. Down about $5 a contract now prob $6 or so by tomorrow if I decide to buy back. What do think wait it out see if gets above 50 just keep premium. Or hold hopefully stays above break even if 40. Or cut loss now and lose $5 to $6 dollars a share.

The short interest of GME dropped to 40 percent. Won’t let me post link but I said it last night and people were just bashing. Short sellers are leaving and at the end of the day you need shorts to be squeezed. GLTA but the hype is dying and other industries are flying don’t hold a bag.

"My take is if small investors keep on buying , shorts will cover at $1000 stock price. But hedge funds are persistent to win over small retail investors.

"peoples salary in a year. I can't predict what's going to happen but im an optimists and i know if we just buy and hold till we as retail investors have the majority of the shares in the bank pool. The key to adding pressure is to have buying demand and we can create demand and add pressure and a some point the cost for each stock will ridiculously rise . Shorts are multi billionaires and they're not going to fold so easily but if we stick to our guns and hold till they cant no more than we all become wealthy if not wealthier. Look the shorts cannot control the market but the banks and retailers/ hedgers can by strategically financing into the system. Unfortunately shorts have picked the wrong spectrum in time to choose to choose AMC as a short interest. Call it the luck of the draw, illegal, manipulation etc. Simple fact is we're here and we're going to make history and transfer amd and distribute the wealth back to the people. If it took you just the bit of time until financials are returned for AMC to become a multimillionaire would you wait or sell it at what the average individual thinks its worth I've heard $20-$40 as reasonable. Ok lol it would be reasonable if it occurred everyday however thats not the case. Multi hundreds of millions is being poured out into AMC you better understand this is like a treasury stake on hand. I wouldn't treat or sell a wuality diamond for $20-$40 would you? My suggestion is wait for Feb 9 and financials and don't panic when you see the short sale ladders or if you see 30% down etc. We're all going through the emotions believe me i get it. And it's a longtime but guess what with hard and smart working skills we can all do this together. I'm sure you understand what I'm saying but then again you may not but if you do your research and analyze it all things are working in favor for the little guy. Hang in there folks BUY AND SELL. This squeeze has a lot to do with financials and money distribution its the fundamentals of AMC why we're all here today discussing what to do with your assets. They only risk you have to identify is what the shorts moves are and so far they seem to be a bit predictable because their desperate. It may seem like their not panicking at the moment but it it happens to them more than we believe. Look the shorts are going to get caught with their pants down the only thing we have to do is suit em up buy em and hold em until we can send them back to the free market. Right now those that are invested in this and are holding yes we are in control. If they win this is $40-$59 if we hold longer all together when that time comes we will win quadruple that but the question you have to ask yourself is can I wait till feb 9th can i wait till financial reports arrive can i stomach the non RRS in place? Etc. I WANT THIS TO BE AT LEAST 10K per share and I'm not selling until it is. Look at lindt stock ask yourself why a chocolate company has a higher valuation than most? This is about money and the money right now is in AMC, GME, ATOS etc. We must stay the course lets not give up. Remember these bad times but in the end you will live out your dream in real life just as long as you hold until they fold. LETS GO "

I entered GME high and I have been buying to lower the costs, at the moment I have 10 shares with average price 239 dollars. I don't have much more money to spend but I still have some.From what i can tell after this wild thing settles (squeeze or no squeeze) GME price would be around 140 dollars but I am not sure. Question is, should I buy more to lower the value and believe that GME after all these will be evaluated around 140 dollars? Or should I just hold and save money for other investments? I am not a English native speaker by the way and I will always HOLD my 10 stocks, but please try to give me your best advice. What do you guys think will be gme finally price after things settle also?Thanks for your help."

GME-OVER!
"My assessment is that the hedge funds helped run up to the highs ($400) to achieve guaranteed run down short positions knowing the chance of a second wave of momentum to carry it back up to those heights would likely not happen. They covered some of the low end shorting and keep deferring ad infinitum but now have shorts betting on a downfall from $400 which are currently netting them money. Hedge funds don't lose $$ unless they give up, thus far they play so many side they're rebounding with new short positions."

Keep in mind that anyone who bought on margin will start getting margin calls when the stock drops by 25%. The broker can begin selling shares rather you want them to or not. Once the stock is down 50% ALL your shares are sold. This forces the stock down exactly the same as a short squeeze forces the stock to rise.
"where does it end? all the wishing in the world doesn't make this a $20 stock, much less a $200 or (laugh) $400 stock. the best it ever sold for was about $45 when business was booming. Who here bought in over $200?"
So GME gets halted after going up BUT not the same going down

"So what happened exactly? My guess is that the original shorts (Melvin, etc.) really did cover their positions early last week and then they took new short positions at the ridiculously high prices that we saw on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Posters here and on Reddit were citing the ever increasing short interest as evidence that the real squeeze had not happened yet, but they did not account for the fact that the old shorts had already been squeezed out and the rising short interest was the result of new shorts taking their place at much higher price levels that were going to be virtually impossible to squeeze. The higher the price of $GME got, the harder it got to push, and the retail investors (if it even was them doing to real pushing, it easily could have been other Hedge Funds) that were really committed to pumping the stock had already sunk all their capital into it by the time it reached $350 or so, so it lost it's upward momentum. That the trade volume didn't align with Melvin's claim to have covered their shorts was regularly put forward as proof that they were lying about covering, but the trade volume was >450M over a 3 day period, and there were only ~70M shares that were shorted so that claim never made sense. There was lots of talk that the high interest rates that the shorts were paying to hold their positions would eventually force them to capitulate, but again, they were new shorts at higher price levels, and it was not as though one hedge fund shorted 140% of GME's float. Those short positions were spread throughout the market and the cost of borrowing, whatever it was, was likely insignificant to the multibillion dollar institutions that were shorting GME, and the huge returns they were looking to make when the price inevitably collapsed."

"millions of retail investors Did not sell for 10X , definitely would’nt settle now for 2X."

I've seen casino stocks in my years of trading but nothing like this. Like to follow it and see what happens.
GME hires former AMAZON high hitter executive.More high profile hires oncomingGME is serious about gme.
Never thought I'd see this: Yahoo Finance is showing a recommendation of HOLD
Here we go...
"this is what happen when people buy stock with no fundament, good stocks(longs) con fall 10% but then recovers(exxon, vlo, citigroup for instance) bad stocks drops and thats it, you loose"
3pm power hour purchase rally? I can probably put down another 10 shares at whatever the price is.
"We all know where this ends, just a mater of when"
Back to trading
"Like here, let me rig this system.. OK all done! now everybody can buy and sell as many shares as they want  LOL "
Bought more today..
What happening? Options due today/?? Anyone?
"STAY STRONG , THE CROOKS ARE COVERING SOME STOCKS FOR NOW AND HOLDING IT DOWN , NOT FOR LONG , SEE YOU @ $1,000"
"There are 8.5 million apishly hyped-up degenerates on WSB standing with you. On top of that, degenerates from all over the globe are still joining $AMC & $GME daily. You're not in this alone. Despite the media & bot attacks, we're not budging or panic-selling. We got our diamond hands on the cookie jar and we're not f'in letting go. ----Their dirty tactic is to artificially drive the price down to accumulate cheap shares while scaring us into panic-selling. And trying to make calls expire worthless. It's very obvious that they're desperately attacking AMC & GME, as both charts are éxactly the same. Their worst nightmare must be us still buying everything we can & holding. They're likely betting we don't have funds nor courage left to buy more... hoping for weak hands to sell shares ridiculously cheap.Their psychological attack is strong... we all feel it.BUT...The power of the masses is truly an unstoppable force. They can slow us down, but they can't stop us. If you spend 5 mins on wallstreetbets, you'll not only see they're not budging nor panicking. They're all going apish, screaming YOLO & buying everything they can. Degenerates from all over the globe are still joining the $AMC & $GME pack and flooding in daily!So if you start doubting, worrying, or eying that cheap wh0r3 of a sell-button... stop. Rub one out, relax, and know we've all got our diamond hands on that huge f'in cookie jar and we're not letting go until we get our f'in big fat juicy cookies!If you can afford the nice bonus, especially if you bought at a higher price, simply buy more at these cheap prices to average down your overall purchase price. More cookies to you.But whatever you do, keep your diamond hands on that f'in cookie jar!"
Check $EXPR TOO
"No idea why you guys are bashing this...Just use it to make money, this stock is the daytrader's dream...Jessus so much hate here.People cant do whateva they want with their money...Just take advantage of it."
"Oh, the humanity...."
To hedge funds of course its not a $100 stock. Its a $1000 stock. The value is a function of your collective colllateral. Wealth transfer to Apes
Where are my $113 baggies be??
Why would they buy at 93 if it's going down hmmm
Hold the line  Love isn't always on time 
Robin Hood is using our losses on a super bowl add. 
"18.34% up from open, it seems to be holding, but who or which side is winning"
Is it possible this hits $30 tomorrow?
"its wayyy too low, hold til 1000"
Wow look at all that call buying for next week we about to end on a high note
go green today so I can load up with more puts for next week. more money more money more 
I haven't seen a single Diamond hand tonight LOL
"GameStop just gave me $5 credit for a game, then turned around and sold it for $44.99. Economic geniuses!"
I can`t stop buying puts
Its a really good sign for longs when a stock closes at the low of the day keep holding them diamonds 
I wonder if this is 300% shorted now. That 226% was from 1/15/21.
"If you look at today's volume (on a big down day) compared with the trade volume from yesterday's slightly up day, it's very telling. The retail investors who thought they couldn't lose are now getting out in masses. GME will continue to fall, picking up speed when it gets closer to single digits."
What if this ends green today?
Where’s all the shorts gone in the chat ?
NEVER SELLING.DONT CARE
"There's one way to solve this problem for now though... if all you millions around the world start buying 1 share per day at this price the shorts would start loosing money again, try a few shares til friday or into next week as part of this historic experiment. Put your heads together a think of (a real) strategy. Reddit boys have the power, they've shown it and almost blew away the big funds. You were half way there and they were scared until the establishment and media stepped in to blame the retailers, like Cramer who said okay you won now sell!!!"
GME is doing the limbo. How low can it go?
Do not let the hedge funds win. Hold it til 1$
"Squeeze of the decade, dont miss you shot at history. This could change society for the better!"
OMG ! I decided at 4:15 this morning that I would not look at this again until lunch time. Then I see this for both $AMC and $GME !! 
"i posted about some one buying 3,181 JAN 5TH PUTS ON GME looks like some one new some thing"
Make it back with $CBDD...growing company...strong buy and hold
wait for the 9 february HOLD!
FOLLOWING THE VW SQUEEZE. HOOOOLD ONNN
Have a great weekend everyone interesting ah session ahead
how GME longs feel inside
Rookie investors trusting the pre-market prices...LMAO! They'll get a dose of reality at the open...
GME weekend pumper party in progress. Two days of pumping and fantasies that GME will be going to the moon
I wonder if GME executives sold stock on the way up?
"Wow just a few days ago this board was riddled with moons and rockets, hold the line gifs and $1000 price targets. Looks like a cemetery now...with only a few still holding for a miracle. Sad but predictable ending"
back to 10 here
"i was here last week. It was all christmas over here. A lot of talk about GME hitting 1000$. Now it feels like doomsday here. The best estimate you get is a 100$. Not a GME buyer, but feels sad to know people loosing their hard earned money..."
By now everyone knows that this stock is inflated artificially and they want a slice of it as it go back down to 10 everyone joins the shorts
insiders sold $1 billion worth of their own shares. Meanwhile retail investors bought the same shares.
Now day traders are just playing.
DIAMOND HANDS!
"Instead of messing with stocks that have already shot to the moon and returned back to earth (somewhat) like $GME and $AMC, why not the ""legion of boom"" target the next moonshot like $DDS and $LGND with over 100% of the float shorted and still on the launch pad? Interesting dynamics.."
the retail investors loading now. ready to hold strong.no real sellers the big guys selling short now to cover it at $1500we will win
Did anyone one here buy back GME after making good profits selling last week?
Nice try boys.... headed back to $5..... going the way of block buster..... sometime Wall Street gets it right
"Chamath Palihapitiya bought into GME, https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/940468/short-seller-hindenburg-turns-up-the-heat-on-gamestop-frenzy-backer-chamath-palihapitiya-940468.htmlSo we have crypto billionaire just bought 10 million shares and Chamath also buys in , where will this be going Monday Think some people need to reach for the calculators again"
Woah what a battle did anyone just saw that!????
"who will be the last short to cover? probably the one who buys my shares, cause i'm holding, baby!"
Shorts still have 26% in SLS. Time for moving up. Marketcap only $95M.Time for people. Look from $GME and $AMC to see SLS
"Whoever is stuck at the high 80s - 150s, right now is the best time to buy and average your price lower. Next week this might explode."
Very strong movement. Bought 4 more . Ain’t much but it’s honest work
"I can almost understand someone who is down 90% not selling. What I can't understand is why someone would still be buying. Who says, I just gotta pay $62 for a $20 stock??"
I've lost 53k on gamestop. Still holding my losses. Can anyone else post losses? #lossporn ?!!
Mark Cuban with the stock. And he said hold it
Wallstreetbets waiting for $GME to go up LOL
Look at gamestop go! It might reach $60 today.
"Well guys, the good news is that the $100 per day down days are over!"
"they're dead-set to prove to all America the scheme they've been running. gamestop is now a global brand, cohen could have been selling shares to fund the company, which we already knew would last at least 2 years. The natural value has become at least 60 dollars because of the news and the possibility for funding, so truly shorts only have about 40 more dollars of profit to make. Until they HAVE to start buying back, if this gets pushed to 0 we will truly have a question about valuation."
Does anybody think that this is still sold short? They've moved on. So should you. Take your losses like a man and get out while it's still double digits.
HOLD!!! Going Back to 100 SOON
I didn't hear no bell
Hold the door! Hodor!
it's gonna squeeze soon
"Well now that the newbies to the stock are gone, it's time it recognize the long term traders. I hadn't lived through a squeeze and lost a little but quickly got outa the way to break even over all. @Jedd, @VIP, @BigBalls I hope ya'll are drinking on a beach somewhere laughing at me and never need to work again. @Tim I hope your still in and I tried to short again at $100, $200, $300 however we all know there where no shares.. Now the only catalyst before earnings in late March or April would be if the Board decides to go through with the Captial raise before then. Place ya bets..."
WHY HALT THE WAY UP BUT NOT DOWN? ITS BECAUSE THEYRE PANICKING!!! BUY BUY BUY!! THEY CAN HALT A MILLION TIMES TILL WE REACH 1K
The hedge funds are totally SCREWED! At some point they have to cover! Why isn't this down to $20.00? My point! YOLO!
"Goldman is always going to make money. That's the core of what they do.Sure, they got a haircut from the $GME joy ride, but they'll get over it. Some VP won't get their bonus, internal memos will be short and snarky and new opportunities will be sought and discovered."
let’s go 1 more shares for a big cause
$AMC $GME BOTH ON SHORT SALE RESTRICTION LIST UNTIL 02/04/2021 
This is going up HUGE tomorrow.
LOL looking for single digit tomorrow
Buy was at $51.15 today.
Kramer just blew a gasket that gamestop wouldn't issue more shares. hmm does someone need shares?
WELL HELLO
"BFT is taken PaySafe public. Once it takes PaySafe public, it could easy see over $50 to $75 a share this year. Management is Great & have made Billions. BFT is cheap at $16.65. They'll take huge amounts business from SQ & PayPal."
Holding at 480.
got 4 shares for fun. maybe lose $100 to maybe gain 1500
Diamond hands to the moon. We are back up baby!
Buy the dip??
Remove emotion and use common sense if the squeeze is over and the stock is crashing why pay 96 dollars for a share in premarket hmmmmm
I feel terrible sorry for all the bag holders. But it was a big gamble you played. I’m sorry again!
Another good stock pick might be Unilever. You see they make Vaseline petroleum jelly. And given there are 4.3 million longs that just bent over and got roughed up really bad in the rear...I'd say there's going to be a pretty healthy demand for Vaseline for a long long time. ha ha ha ha
Sell now or wait for 50?Trying to maximize my tax loss
Guys. Place your buy orders during the 5 mins halt. It will rocker more and more . We r back in control. $GME to the moon.
Lol no shorts are posting. Finally!!! They all trying to figure out how to pay their bills...
"Ok class,*loads gme chart onto projector screen* today we are gonna learn what a bearish chart looks like"
"I'm all for standing up to the man, but what RH crowd did this morning was to just hand the man another really obvious money making opportunity. It's frustrating and unfortunate they can't tell the difference between playing the game and getting played. Guys, wait for it to drop back down to $25-30 THEN buy and hold and keep holding."
Hate to disappoint but odds are it does nothing till after hours all hedges want is your options premium
"Kids, kids, kids....are you still planning on going to the moon ? I feel bad for you that you didn't have proper parental investing guidance."
Where are you boomers finding all these memes? I love it!
"For those who still holding, selling now does not make sense."
300 This Friday.
today they try to drop more morning but they lost energy
A group of people on Reddit manipulating the stock market is no different than a hedge fund doing it. GME closed 300 stores last year- it's the Blockbuster Video of gaming. AMC will never come back as home TV screens get larger and thinner by the year. There was professional money from hedge funds on both sides of that trade anyway.
Not looking good. Diamond hands turn to paper hands fast in the stock market.
Going to crash at noon
feel like $65 is a wall! If we break it we can go to $70
What if the SEC says something about hedge funds should close a certain amount of short positions. That would trigger another pump.
bought yesterday 50 @70 :)
Won't Stop!
Can you guys pump this back to the 110 range? thanks.
You can gauge the desperation of shorts trying to get people to sell. Interest alone got to be breaking the bank.
We’re going to the moon lads and laddettes 
Are you WSB still holding?...lol
"With the new C-suite and closure of 97% of all retail locations and a dramatic switch in gear and direction, GME has a chance to come back, but not this year or the next. If u a the long type, it would be good to buy when this thing plateaus. I’m thinking around $15-20."
whether you realize now or notthe mngrs at robinhood and other firmswho eliminated margin for clueless newbies on highly speculative stocksand reduced exposure saved you from yourselves
"Hey there, we're still buyinggggg"
"Get a Costco size bag of chips, for all the DIPS that we keep having, enjoy!"
HF made money too- on both sides people made money https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink
"I have no stake in GME, but to all the shills, trolls, and keyboard warriors leaving your hedge fund bootlicking comments - just wait til they shut down trading in your favorite stock because of this precedence, that’d be pretty funny too, right?"
"It can happen any minute, this is a stock event that will make the books. Nobody truly knows how it'll play out because not all the information is out there currently."
Lets squeeze $SNDL to 20$...like we did with $AMC $GMEToday we create a rocket here!!
So what is the SEC doing about hedge funds shorting GME down to nothing??? These C r oo ks are shorting it to $10! That was their target from the beginning!!!!
"$GME $AMC keep listening to the diamond hands bagholding these, meanwhile real traders already banked their profits long ago "
Oh boy oh boy more dipstime to average
Going to be funny when all the naysayers and shorts have to cover when this is going up today.
Everyone kept calling us bots and paid to post. Does the 480 to 65 help open your eyes? We are trying to save you from completely losing it all. Smh
Lets get this to 145!

"In 2009, the entire world (including Cramer) said that Banks were dead and not investable. What happened next?Banks continued to outperform the market for the next decade.If you invested in banks at or near the low, you made a fortune.Since March of 2020, the stock market has irrationally declared oil companies as dead. They point to the lack of demand due to COVID.The COVID demand issue removed 5 million barrels per day of demand from the market. The oil market demand is currently 96 million barrels per day. This is a demand reduction of less than 5% during the worst pandemic in a century.As as they declared banks as dead in 2009, pop culture says that COVID has made oil dead. Just as in 2009, they’re wrong.Oil inventories in the US and China continue to drop. COVID cases are dropping precipitously. Vaccines are being distributed. Demand is back.Meanwhile, world leaders are making oil drilling nearly impossible due to environmental concerns. This means supply is limited in a rising demand scenario.The result according to Goldman Sachs, is the beginning of a new secular bull market in oil. For the next 12-15 years, oil will be priced at over $100 a barrel.This means huge profits for the oil companies. These profits will be used to buy out wind & solar competitors as the world transitions to green.If you lost big in $GME or $AMC, or you gained big in $TSLA, now is the time to invest in oil companies. Buy $XLE $CVX $XOM $OXY $ET & $GEL.It’s like buying banks in 2009. You will be rewarded big."
The desperation in the media reports and comments from the shills trying to tell everyone to sell or laugh about the people holding... we will see next week when SI updates.
10.00 to 15.00 come close tomorrow???? or less??
Short interest still good for that big gamma squeeze hold the line
Love adding cheapies in this range 
Mark Cuban explained what's happening. he said he'd hold I'm this situation. not telling others to

I love seeing shorties such angry and desparate today :D
"Not a kid or a milennial, but I have to say, I LIKE THIS STOCK. I think I will hold on to it for a while."
"These diamond hands are hard to cook with. I made a mess last night, but at least I still have my gamestonks."
"Just FYI, a 5 day downhill slide is not a dip"
How much does it cost me to HOLD?
Please realize this isn’t going Back up... please be smart about your money

Stock halted twice already. WTH is going on?
I just heard a hot tip on WSB... it's GME. oh...wait... BWHAHAHAHAHAHA
QUESTION TO SHORTS :why hasn't GME made any announcement or board cashed out
As long as we hold sooner or later they will break.
ROBINHOOD WILL GO BK SOON...
"The guys who are holding have way more money then you and are tons more educated in the stock market then you, money lost is a lesson gained! Remember the VW squeeze."
It's over. Sell while u still can. 20 is coming soon.
This stock is last week's news. Enjoy your mini gains this is still going to $0

"AMC is not the focus GameStop is, AMC was used to divert people focus, we can't win if we are all dispersed in BB, GME, AMC, or NOK, we need to focus all of our resources on one battlefront. that's why the HF are winning smh"

Where are shorts now! Enjoy Super Bowl with your boyfriends!

You think everybody in on this is gonna hold? Of course they took profits. Everyone wants to make money.
GME appoints 3 NEW executives to push forward e-commerce and customer focused transformation!!
"WallStreetBets Mods Are Now Battling For Control Over The Subreddit.""It’s unclear where exactly the battle lines are being drawn up between the old mods and the new, but supporters of zjz have already created a new subreddit called WallStreetBetsTest and created a petition to try and get control of WallStreetBets proper transferred over to zjz. Another mod, disabledsexrobot, announced on WallStreetBetsTest that they were resigning from the original WallStreetBets in protest.This comes amidst a reckoning as GameStop’s stock price continues to plummet. It started trading at just over $90 Thursday and is currently trending downwards to just $50. The subreddit that started meme stock mania is now coming apart at the seams, egging each other on to “hold the line” and not sell their existing shares, while others try to tease out how this all ends without them losing a bunch of money. This groundswell of desperation has led redditors to make pleas to billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. Nevermind that said billionaires are beneficiaries of the same rigged Wall Street system that some on WallStreetBets purported to be fighting, leading to support behindGameStop and AMC stocks. Meanwhile, some investors who were winning big just a week ago are now coming to grips with steep losses as the whole thing unravels.Subreddit power struggles are nothing new, especially when they grow exponentially almost overnight. Of course, none have been at the center of big financial controversies before. Congress is currently set to hold hearings in the House about GameStop and other meme stocks on February 18. Maybe it can get some of WallStreetBets mods to testify at it as well. """
"Remember when the press was swooning over that army of Reddit renegades who were rewriting the script for the entire investing universe?Yeah, that was yesterday. Today the noobs who hurled their life savings into GME shares at $400 are wondering how many extra years they're going to have to work. YOLO!"
Everyone who sold when the market opened
GME and AMC are being played by the same playbook! Graphs for the past week nearly exact!!!!!
"They doing alot of highering. fired former AWS enginneering leader as CTO,Names Matt Francis CTO , he use to be former Amazon, Chewy Exec. Kelli Durkin as Seniro VP of Customer care and Jush Krueger as VP of Fullfillement. Something is stirring in Gamestop. HMMMM"

Buying a $2 stock for $350 you deserve this guys - losing it all
These kids from Reddit are either trolling or drank too much of the cool aid. One example “ I bought at 356 and will be holding till this goes to zero or to the moon” wow
Still only bots left in here.....
Hedge fund trolls are thick in here today. I sense fear in them.
I'm buying more

"Anyone ever heard of 3dcart - Shift4 recently bought them - think of a website building platform that now has a payment processor - reminds me of SHOP - just announced this news.News & EventsPrint FormatChange Text Size:Default text sizeA Larger text sizeA Largest text sizeASuper Bowl Ad for Inspiration4 Invites Viewers to Join World’s First All-Civilian Mission to SpaceBY Business Wire— 9:00 AM ET 02/03/2021Directed by Bryce Dallas Howard and fueled by Celeste’s ‘twinkling’ take on a classic lullaby, the spot features an inspiring opportunity to support St. Jude Children’s Research HospitalLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Inspiration4, scheduled to become the world's first all-civilian mission to space later this year, will introduce itself to the public and extend an invitation to the stars this Sunday on one of the biggest stages Earth has to offer – the broadcast of Super Bowl LV.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210203005282/en/A 30-second commercial, which highlights the milestone event in human space exploration and announces the opportunity for two people to join the four-person crew, will run during the first quarter of CBS's national broadcast of the game. The release of the spot today follows Monday’s announcement of the Inspiration4 mission at SpaceX headquarters and the humanitarian and charitable message Inspiration4 intends to deliver.Entitled ""Join Us"" and expected to reach a viewing audience in excess of 100 million people, the ad revolves around simple but elegant close-up shots of an authentic SpaceX Suit, adorned with a patch representing the mission’s four pillars – Leadership, Hope, Generosity and Prosperity. As the camera moves across the suit, the voice-over intones, “This fall Inspiration4 launches as the first all-civilian mission to space, and you could be on board.” The commercial ends with an invitation for viewers to go to space, and to visit the mission’s website, www.inspiration4.com, to learn more.The commercial was fittingly directed by the actress, producer and director Bryce Dallas Howard, for whom space has held a personal fascination since childhood. She is the eldest daughter of actor and filmmaker Ron Howard, who directed the iconic and Academy Award-winning film “Apollo 13,” a profile in courage of the ill-fated third lunar landing in 1970. In addition to her acting credits, Howard has also directed episodes of “The Mandalorian.”Howard’s direction of “Join Us” is accentuated by unexpected and inviting music and voice-over. A fresh and enchanting take on the timeless lullaby “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” is provided by Celeste, a British-Jamaican singer and songwriter who won the BBC’s “Sound of 2020” poll and the BRIT Awards’ “Rising Star” prize last year. Her debut album, “Not Your Muse,” was released last week via Interscope Records. Voice-over was provided by Academy Award-winning actress Octavia Spencer.Regarding her role in directing the commercial, Bryce Dallas Howard said: “To me, this was an undeniable opportunity to present the ultimate Golden Ticket. This mission represents just how much humanity has to offer, and it was essential to capture that in everything from the photography of the SpaceX suit to Celeste’s beautiful soundtrack. I got to reunite with some longtime collaborators to make this happen: John Schwartzman behind the camera, Octavia Spencer as our voice, and ILM in the edit. And working with SpaceX, Shift4, and Known, it was like we were kids again re-discovering the awe and wonder of the cosmos. Many times throughout this process I had to remind myself, as I’m sure many folks will do while watching the spot, that yes, this is real and this is happening.”The Inspiration4 commercial was created by Emmy Award-winning marketing agency Known, the agency of record for Shift4 Payments (FOUR) and Shift4Shop. The team that collaborated on the spot includes the Academy Award-winning crew from Industrial Light and Magic as well as Academy Award-winning Director of Photography John Schwartzman, whose credits include “Jurassic World,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” and “Seabiscuit.”As announced earlier this week, the Inspiration4 mission will be commanded by Jared Isaacman, the 37-year-old founder and chief executive officer of Shift4 Payments (FOUR) and an accomplished pilot, philanthropist and adventurer. Shift4 Payments (FOUR) will be donating a crew seat to a deserving entrepreneur demonstrating innovation and ingenuity using the new Shift4Shop platform. Isaacman has committed to give $100 million to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is inviting everyone to join him in attempting to raise upwards of $200 million or more in support of St. Jude’s multi-billion-dollar expansion aimed to accelerate research advancements and save more children worldwide.“The Inspiration4 mission gives us a historic opportunity to not only explore space but assembl"

1 share buy limit on robinhood saves there biggest customer Citadel and others from going under-THIS STORY IS ONLY BEGINNING..congress has to get involved
Why buy at 75 when it's crashing lmaoUse common sense people
funny how obvious they manipulate the stock. 100 shares each trade.
"If Robinhood is determined to: maintain orderly markets, by restricting purchases of GME stock, correspondingly, they ought to restrict further Short Selling of GME stock. That would make things a lot more fair."
GME management managed to sell ZERO equity during the pump. What does that say?
"How can I become a paid basher and pumper. Seriously, I can use the extra cash."
"just look at the chart, this is over"
I'm sorry that robinhood and wall street stole your money
I bought this stock about$400.00 and I m don’t worry about loosing I m want to truth. They always manipulate the stock. HOLD!!!Remember if you are not sale you never loose. HOLD $5K
Serious question. I made a few bucks but kept 2 shares for fun. If everyone is shorting this is it not possible to happen again or too many lost money to buy in again?
Isn’t Roaring Kitty the one who started all of this now part of the millionaires they so willfully despise? The irony of it all.
LETS GOOOOOO
40 minutes before the train leaves. Buy a ticket now!
"In case you didn't know, Mark Cuban bought JCP at $12 before it went bankrupt."
Watch the tape- big selling above $100
thanks to RH and all the other brokerage firms doing what they did basically killed the momentum.

Buying GME is like buying a ticket on the Titanic.
"Robin hood will let you buy all you went when GME is back under $10. Sorry, big money always wins."

Strange how there are no circuit breakers on downwards volatility
Gonna hold my 26 GME at $380 indefinitely and will print the transaction and balance as nice poster with WSB logo with diamond hands on top. It will become part of history and an antique piece.

Retail will always lose in the end. Take your loss and move on.
Wall street bankers would like to thank you for donating all of your money to them.Thanks
Yes baby diamond hands
"I did my part, buy the dips now I become a Diamond Hand !!!"

I bought 4 shares at $250 for $1000 and sold all 4 at $365 for $1460. Made a nice 46% return in two days !!!
"I don't have any GME stocks but your fast recovery from low 80s is nothing ""short"" of amazing"
How come AMC and GME have the same exact daily trend lines? This isn't manipulation lol.
"Buy the dip!!!!! Oh wait, I have no money left."
My etrade is wacked. Shows share price jumping to $300.00 for split seconds. Has done it 3 times in the last 10 minutes. Something coming???
"It’s fun reading all the posts of GME longs! “Epic short squeeze galore” “coiled spring” “cover now shorty”The fact of the matter is people are buying into the GME hype, when they should be visitingA casino!!! LMAO"
GME represents a unique case. Normally with shorting the number of stocks in the market is enough to cover the short positions but the act of shorting creates fictitious shares. In theory the share could be borrowed an infinite amount of times. GME was shorted to the tune of 140% effectively creating more shares than actual exists. GME has a relatively small float of shares available in the market. The stock went up in price forcing the people who shorted the stock to cover but the retail traders were holding on to the stock forcing the market to find a price that would force the holders of the stock to sell. Hence why the retail investors say to the moon. I hope this helps.This will go down in history.

Sugar and salt have the same color. All I’m going to say about the stock market .
So how many bought GME at $469 last week?
"We all know by now, the Hedge funds and Shorters scare tactics. We know them.We will talk more tomorrow when you need to cover your 1B$ of short sale.As for now, I'm holding my 23k of AMC Shares!!!See you tomorrow.$AMC $GME $NOK"

"Last call to buy in 90s, will not see it again, buy and hold "
The good news is those of us who held till now probably wont be selling anytime soon
"Very bullish GME is still shorted way above 100%, the hedgefunds are getting desperate, which is apparent if you look at all the paid shills/bots, the short-ladder-attacks and the post/pre-market manipulation. Doesn't matter though, they can buy back my shares at $3000 "
The paid trolling is getting pretty desperate because I believe the uptick rule comes back into effect on some exchanges tomorrow. In other words those laddered selloffs don't work anymore.This is a Stock Occupation and Wall Street needs to stop Trespassing in an American Company.
"Very bullish! The hedgefunds are scared about the potential emergency board meeting and/or the reverse split, which would force them to cover all the (+100%) short positions. See you at $1000 bby "
"Price was 4.00 this summer with the pandemic and not many people shopping retail. Went up to around 10.00 when the new CEO came in. I think those are good levels to look at if this thing starts to fall, but prices tend to overshoot before finding the right level. If it drops under 10.00 and settles, I think that's a healthy sign that it'll find its footing again. If it goes under 4.00, that would be the overshoot that it might see."
only ones left are the lifetime bag holders now
God bless the people still buying. Atleast GME has great management from now on out.
We can totally make another squeeze happen. Not as crazy as the first but VERY close. I know we can. Who ever is holding and panicking ..just roll one up and chill. We are gonna be ok LOL u just maybe gotta do some over time at work but it will all be worth it. But then again I’m high af so let’s see how high the chart and I could go 
So RH suppressed the price of $GME and AMC long enough for the shorts not to get slaughtered. That’s what happened folks. We made the right trade and the billionaires on Wall St CHEATED.Never forget it! The system is RIGGED in their favor. Always has been!
"If it weren't for the crooked brokers we would already be past the squeeze. Robinhood & CO made GME lose momentum, we couldn't even defend against short-ladders since we weren't allowed to buy anything lmao. Oh well, the squeeze will come, and Robinhood & CO will face consequences for their illegal market manipulation. The hedgefunds are still losing billions, just look at the ammount of paid shills/bots on this board, I've never seen anything like it."
Massive covering after market. Stay tuned.
"Perhaps history is in the making, imagine the press tomorrow if this closes 85.00"
"Shorted at $448, best short trade ever!!"
"I personally believe y’all are not too far away from another major spike up. Just looking at VW squeeze same looking chart. Had a good run, then it popped big. Retreated all the way back to about where it started trading then it skyrocketed up to its absolute peak. Just my 2 cents on the subject. Guess we will see here in a week or so"
If GME were a car
Power Minute!
Up we go. LOL the manipulative walls Hahahahahaha
I want to know who bought all those $800 calls the other day. Poor guy.

"$GME float 47M, $SAVA only 22M.A lot can be done with those fresh shorts today. Massive manipulation this afternoon on SAVA."
"This has become one of the saddest yahoo threads around... I feel for a lot of you like the guy that dropped his mortgage pay off when the stock was already up to $350... I’m not trying to be rude but it seems a ton of people on here didn’t look up the basics of the market before hopping on this bandwagon.. by the time it struck its high it was green.. green no good green no buy.. lol This stocks going back to the gutter where it started, for those of you on the fence about selling this isn’t going to run again.. the WSB mellonaire wetards already bounced with their bags and forgot about you.. get out while you can and go read if you really wanna play in the market. A run like this is still a possibility, just not with this stock... best of luck everyone and no this isn’t financial advice, it’s common sense"
"At the end of the day, there is law of gravity, which is the bottom line. GME likely will dwindle to $40 or so and find a support, then begin to trade like a normal stock, meaning up or down 2-3 percentage each trading day. This is already a very good scenario for GME. In the worst scenario, it will go back to around $20. The sheer stupidity is that the management never took the opportunity to issue shares which could be above $100 per share ... they did not have the guts to do that, you know why? Very simple, they know the business really, really not worth that, and worry about SEC action down the road if they do that. Guess what, now that it drops, it may very come out to raise money at $40's and not worry as much SEC action. Think that will also be an ultimate solution and bring stability to the stock."
"GameStop grabbed headlines after a coordinated effort by retail investors to squeeze short sellers caused the stock to surge multiple times. It has lost more than 80% of those gains in recent days, but despite that has still added about $5.1 billion in value this year. Been watching stocks like this. Found a service that tells me buys and sells. https://daytradingsquad.team/TrueTradingGroup"
"Don't be too eager to pump this stock. This is a technical bounce, exactly as I predicted (see my post history). This will fall back down. Way too many bag holders from up on high."

"Short sale restriction doesn't stop good old fashioned selling from longs, which is exactly what happened all day long today.

NEWS just came out -- Revolut announces trading restrictions have been lifted from GME !!

"Remember when this board was full of pumpers and newbies pretending they knew it all , oh wait that was like 3 days ago "
buy before FOMO!!!
it's a function of options expire dates and shares available. If you can afford to hold you should. It will squeeze again how high depends on when holders sell.
why is the authorities not doing anything? halted multiple times when going up
Sell this ASAP get into NAKD. Or better just watch it after hours tommorow this chat will have a lot of “ I told you” memes

"Blue Horseshoe loves Blue APRN. APRN is next short squeeze and likely will pop before earnings on Feb. 18, which will exceed. While APRN is up $3 (just below $10) since this started a week ago, it should be at $40 to be on par with competitors Marley Spoon (MMM) and HelloFresh. Of their combined market, APRN has about 8% of the market (customers and revenue) but less than 2% of the market cap, all thanks to shorts."
People who sold for a loss just wanna a drag anyone they can with them. Sorry bud we’re HOLDING!

"I came over here just to read comments, and I can’t believe some of them. Hedge funds did not make you lose money. It was your social media con buddies telling you to pay hundreds of dollars for a stock worth about $15. While your con buddies were telling you this was a noble mission to hurt hedge funds, they were cashing out with huge profits. I have no idea where this stock is going to trade for the next few days, but it’s eventually going to be a lot lower than where it is now."
Yes baby our gamma squeeze is working!
what do you expect rise to 1 million per share for 100 years lmao.

Do you guys also hold quarter sticks until they blow or what
Round two!!
"For all of you who somehow keep touting this stock as being worth $500 or $1000/share, you need to rethink your perspective. As I've said here, stocks will ultimately track the actual value of the business. Do any of you have a good sense for why Game Stop is worth $500 or $1000/share? If you do, please post that. My view is that it isn't worth more than, say, $20/share. That's based on their brand and perhaps some inventory and leases. That's it. Please please please learn something from this debacle. Otherwise you will continue to lose money on the stock market. Stocks can trade at any value at any time, frankly, for any reason. However over time they will reflect the value of the business. That's the benefit of a capital market. Any other way to interpret this will lead to you losing money."
At least you can only put in a few hundred bucks. A few more late-night shifts at the drive through should cover it.

"after hours not looking good, big gap down at open tomorrow is looking likely."
GNW is next GME. (Raddit)
"We are still $80+ up from $10. They’re still stuck. The squeeze has not happened. People need to realize the price only went because the demand went down. The demand only went down because they restricted buying on brokers. Once these restriction/ are lifted and once people move to brokers that aren’t restricting it will start rising. As well as the the hedge funds are losing money each day because they’re stuck shorting the company. Once they start covering their short position the stock will skyrocket because they need to buy, which equals more demand. I personally bought more shares at this discount. Buy at your own risk. People on this board don’t determine what you do with your money. Do your research. I know there’s a lot of new retail investors who’ve lost money don’t know what’s happening right now. Do your research and make your decision. Good luck"

Why is it impossible to post real financial data for GME? Only shortie bots allowed to this board?
Power hour coming up.
"The amount of paid shills/bots speaks for itself. GME is still shorted way above 100%, the hedgefunds are bleeding billions each day, lmaooo. Pretty soon they'll be forced to buy at whatever price we set. See you at $1000 "
WHERES THE BOUNCE?
Seriously tho you might not want to buy anymore options till Monday morning this might rocket in after hours or tank
"Just to be clear, in a Covid world where people are more likely to be playing video games GME revenue in the most recent qtr was down 40% year-over-year. The company has done a great job managing costs, but in spite of this they have lost nearly $100m per quarter these past few quarters. They are burning cash and have most likely exhausted their ability to borrow. It is reasonable to think this business will be in deep distress within a year or two at most. There are 70M shares outstanding. $4 per share is $280M market-cap. Why is it worth $280M?"
Innocent people have been rigged throughout the whole event.
I kinda saw it coming it was a few smart investors organized a bunch of new traders with a relatable theme. It actually isn't that well though out of a theme if you take down hedge funds you will take down pensions and millions of peoples retirements. I pretty sure based of the price movement that the originals have sold leaving there followers with the bag.

"These hedge fund guys just sour because they tried to sell their old games to gamestop and a 19 year old didn’t fall for their shady sales tactics. With the new restructuring of their company, I see myself investing in this for a long time."
"Some GME hard data: $6 per share of cash; $10+ bn of projected annual revenues for 2021 (at least giving new console cycle), Ryan Cohen (now owns 12% of GME) + 2 fellow enter the BOD in January to transform GME into the cultural hub for video-gaming. Actual market cap under $5bn; What can be market cap in 2 years? Not less than $50bn, implying apporx. $500 per share. These are simple calculation everyone can run based on balance sheet data and other publicly available info. This story is very exiting and unfolding in the coming months/years. I'll defintely be part of the story as a shareholder. I'm not an advisor, this is not financial advice. Do not trust those who are not disclosing who they are.

"Last Thursday I responded to @Kunal 's post that this was a classic (textbook) pump and dump. What we used to do to stocks under 10 bucks (usually pennies under 5) back in 2007. Find the sheep for the wolves to prey upon. What you longs did was worse! Not only did you manipulate an already dying company, and herd the sheep to slaughter, but you gave the apple to the hedgefunds, let them take a bite, thus empowering them! And they'll make their billions back in no time! You made them that much wiser. The unfortunate ones are the ones you led astray from reality. Those are the ones that got hurt! And for what?? To get back at the shorts?? Someday you'll realize that to have a healthy market, you'll understand that the longs need the shorts, and the shorts need the longs! I swing trade the dips, and thank God for BOTH parties! We need volatility when trading! How boring and mundane would trading be if the markets rose and fell at a snails pace year after year? So, don't ever think that you are going to bankrupt Wallstreet, or the likes of Goldman Sachs! The hedgefunds lawyers 'ARE' the SEC, Wallstreet, Congress, YOUR BROKER! Therefore, dust yourself off... and move on! Quit trying to screw the world. You're only hurting others, and yourself. Lesson...Learned!"

"Bought 4 more GME< holding 14. Listened to a prediction of how GME's business model could change for profitability...and I like the stock. My first 10 were bandwagon, but these last 4 are from the heart!!!! DIAMOND HANDS HOLDING LOOOONG."
Im gonna laugh so hard when this still ends up red by the end of today
Classic bear trap ...
$GME $AMC#BIGDICKENERGYLets get that trending on twitter. Posts on WSB - Lets gooooo
Looks like it will close under $70
Robinhood lifts restrictions and the price soars! It’s gotta be the shorts getting burned because there’s no way the Robinhooders would overpay for GME!
STOCKNEWB I’m saying tomorrow jackas .. by EOW it’ll be at 50 next week 20
It's halted again....
The people need to stand up to the greed of the hedge funds. I am doubling down here
HOLD your puts
What would be a fair price to buy GME ?
This is a $3.84 a share stock based on the fundamentals and is borderline bankrupt so why would you 20 Year old amateurs continue to drink the koolaid and lose allYour allowance money ?
Look like we can buy calls and buy SPY/QQQ Put and we can double our money in no time.Why so much inverse relationship between two.We talking $3b market cap stock. Give me break.
$GME and $AMC -> to da Moon!
im down 75k
Holding
"Thanks shorty keep it coming, it will add to the 160k I took out last week"
Hopefully most of short squeeze ideologues and late to the game followers are stating to understand the complete nature of your game. You've inflicted damage on many small account holders and the very act of jacking weak company stocks to outrageous prices actually creates another entry point for short side players. There was absolutely nothing virtuous about the run in AMC or GME. It was in fact a play among the greedy to grab a bucket from others at there expense and that included both long side position holders and short side players.
This thing is so volatile...when do I buy...honestly. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Do you really think retail pumped this up 60% this morning? no.. this was institutions pumping higher to unload their shares into retail at higher price. #think
No ones knows the exact amount of shorted shares it more than the company owns! that’s what SEC is investigating! For sure shorts are printing more shares. But GME will probably go for 10 for 1 reversal split soon!
"Going up! Power hour bb! Now that RH is not restricted any more, GME $1,000 EZ!"
"The investors who sent shares of GameStop and several other companies to previously unfathomable heights relied on a Reddit-based forum as a central gathering point to discuss trading strategies, egg each other on and move in unison to squeeze hedge funds that had shorted stocks. Regulators are examining whether any of their activity was illegal."
The $GME lawsuit against Robinhood is not about money. It's about subpoena power and figuring out what is really going on under the hood of Wall Street.
$AMC $GME will recover USA market
How's life going?
people who have alot of stocks of GME is not selling. they're doubling down on their shorts. there is no way they covered their 120% of shorts with price chart looking like this. alot of us still holding the line. it will go up even faster as we progress through week.
GME is not going to do a stock offering to pay off debt cause they are probably going to file for bankruptcy.
Full circle . . . came to this party at $89 last week and left at $445GME rocks!
I wake up everyday at 4am to watch the market and make my decisions they were buying at 96 dollars this morning why pay 96 if it's going to 50 hmmmmmCommon sense people today will be heavy sell pressure and a sideways market options expire friday after the bell
Interesting that whenever you click someone's profile to see what their other comments are - they are often playing both sides of the stock. Bear and Bull. I have no idea what that means. The only thing I can take from that is that most of these comments are not genuine.
"I got a business idea if anyone wants to invest. send me your used video games, after they are checked for quality i can give you credit, then these used games can be put together in bundles and sent to people for great values and surprise as a monthly loot crate. but that couldn't happen...."
"If you don't believe me just Google it!If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are not entitled to the dividend. 3 In fact, the investor is instead responsible for paying the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed. Investors short a stock if they expect it to decline in value.Over %100 short would make GameStomp lots of money if a huge dividend is declared. Imagine doing that when the short was over $200.This is a she hated for any company."
Diamonds are forever.

CRAMER SAYS HE LOVES GAMESTOP 2021
Yesterday this was the worst stock I very was advised to buy. Today it's down again. Normally I would sell 10% down but I was told by very connected dudes this will be way up by close this Thursday. Hopefully
"Buffett always said to buy when there is blood on the street.But in this case it isn't blood, just a lot of hot air."

I bought today at 120. Can we see +200 again?
It’s not about what people are predicting this stock has in store. Use your calculator factor a 6billion dollar market cap and how much upswing this stock NOW needs to go up. I know people who have refinanced a house mortgage last week in hopes of living lavish for life who are now in the hole. Don’t listen to anyone but the math. If you still have money left buy into a cheap affordable stock ANY and regain your capital. Look at the market cap for this new stock and your calculator should show you what’s going to happen. I’ve been suggesting NAKD because I have subscribed into cramers private chat and this has been the lesson for the day hence why I am saying this. We all got into this stock to change our lives not make it worse and if I can share a tip then...
"A 2nd wave pop is clearly coming, this has scrapped off the 87-88 area for a few days now showing a temporary bottom. The Robinhood restrictions will be relieved further tomorrow, allowing more reddit users to buy back in. And there are still some shorts to squeeze out. It will never get near the previous high, but wouldn't be surprised to see another visit to $200"
This is 68 bucks in Germany.
If you post your losses from your screen shot real time. I’ll pay pay you $500
let's go buy low sell more low D:
The Hedge Fund managers reading the comments the penny a post promoters turn in at the end of the week
$20 incoming.
I am holding and will buy more today. Keep the line. we are the biggest Hedge Fund to make the Stock sky rocketing again.. And make them pay.
"Stock is highly undervalued, expecting 300/400 dollars next weekl"
HOLD!!!
NO ONE IS SELLING LETS GO
"Yesterday this board suggested 10- 15 at close yesterday, today pm 10.84% up how come, no position at all but so fascinating, just as we are watching and commenting on this today I dare say from the Reddit numbers of new members last couple of months they will be to. Clearly there is serious money pouring into this."
"Drop it a little more so I can buy more. This scare tactics are getting all, everybody can see in level 2 what you are doing"
GME just closed at it's lowest point since the high last week of $483........
I’m going to go ahead and say anyone that shorted this up in the 300’s made a lot more money than anyone buying and holding... invest in a real company
If you haven’t Time to buy BB .. for sale .. good price more shares..
"To short a share an investor must borrow it, eventually returning it to the lender. They sell the stock in the expectation the price will drop, and the mechanism requires each share be bought back to close a trade. With 12 per cent of the shares outstanding sold short, it was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position.In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began."
shouldn't we buy goods from GME. we want the company not to go bankrupt. otherwise the HFs will win.
"I've been tweeting ""Gamestonk"" yet the share price falls. It was quiet the opposite when Elon Musk did the same. Why???"
The hedge funds have had a good run for the past week while the retail investors have been blocked. it will be interesting when they are allowed to buy again. Hedge funds are in over their heads with a suicidal 226% short float.
Its looking green Diamond hands baby ! $GME $AMC
"Trust the charts, peeps, not the pumpers and bashers. Good thing I'm an expert and trying to reach you all how to make money in any market, in any direction. I also correctly called the pandemic and the resulting sell off and made huge gains shorting the market and then riding it back up.https://photos.app.goo.gl/2ZQzcr9tpuNNwWsRA"
"If the HF’s keep selling to drive down and the price and the Retailer’s keep picking up shares, are t the HF’s losing ground that way?"
"The vice that constructed this squeeze was possible because the short on the stock created more shares than there are on the market evidenced by 140% short interest last week. I have been unable to verify the short interest is still the same. I could verify that it is currently at 50% therefore the probability of spike is severely diminished i.e you need unwilling participants to come to market mainly short sellers desperate to cover their positions to have a spike. Face it the spike was not do to good old fundamentals like great sales it was due to greed on the part of the hedge funds but i doubt if they are going to have to learn their lesson twice. Note if hedge funds keep dwelling in options to cover the ""fiat shares"" and a large percentage of shareholders hold on, the spike will be historical."

ALSO, the opposite, they talk a stock DOWN, and three days later it is up. Turning them off and doing what I THINK IS RIGHT. I am not sure who gives them their marching orders."
It does not drop from 400 to 50 without a good bounce. Hop on for a 20-50% day

Short interest is actually 88%
boom there it is
"14.93 % up, where’s this AH thoughts ?"
"Isn't yesterday's ""sell off"" artificial.....isn't that the BAD of the market. This is meant to be a supply and demand market, not those with lots of money able to ladder the price down. GME   "
The company is Bankrupt. It has NO Product. It is just a third party seller. It has NO Product. No brand. It will go to $0.
Hold! Looks good!
"After you all brought down the entire market last week, I figured I’d share the wealth and shorted this dog yesterday. Made over $60k. Thanks rookies!"
"So...I don't think anyone predicted things would be this stable, huh?"
Don't forget this is a $5.00 fair value stock. Early holders still have a 1000% gain. There is still a lot space to the downside.
"Hold the line, don't selll - I invested into 20 shares when it cost $347 a piece and still holding."

Who else comes here just to laugh at the comments 
With shorts around 100% it would make sense to declare dividends so they have to pay!
Like my previous post if you have diamond.
Not all the hedge funds and institutions are the enemy. Some may have shorted but I am sure after the recent pull downs many have closed the short position and I am certain some are long on these stocks as well. It would be in their best interests to join the retail longs as these stocks continue to gain interest and rise in share prices. $AMC $GME $BB $NOK $NAKD $BBBY $KOSS ..... Diamond hands !!!!!!
All in
Don't worry longs. At least you now have a life long capital loss carryover that you can take on your taxes for the rest of your life....... HA HA
5 minutes to 80$! join! they are coming!
I told you on Saturday but someone got my post taken down. My team rewrote these algos over the weekend. The loophole that was being exploited is now closed.
100 plus monday
Breaking News... Robinhood has eliminated all buy restrictions on all stocks including Gamestop.... Time to show us all what you got Wallstreetbets people. The stock should soar now right?
More fake shares being sold. Come on SEC do your job and shut down the illegal manipulation
"Do not sell if you see any of the following:The stock drops by 50% in a day. This is just hedgies pushing it down using ladder attacks to make it look like the squeeze is over.SEC reports show that the shorts have covered their positions. This is misinformation spread by Wall Street.GME drops down to $1 shareGME declares bankruptcyGME is delisted by the NY Stock Exchange CommissionYour grandchildren in the future are working in investment banking and are telling you to stop posting "" diamond hands  "" every time someone mentions a company that went out of business 50 years ago"
"I remember trying to help all you hand  the other day. You told me to get lost, paper hand, etc..... well I just sold some puts today.... made 50k. I wanted to thank all of you for your kind donation. I guess every Gen Z is an investor these days. Just not a very good one. Next time listen to someone who’s been to the dance before. But thank you all for your contribution."
Poker faces everyone! You know it works. You saw it with $GME and $AMC. It takes days to squeeze. Hold! Don't listen to all the short bots on here who want you to sell so their overlords can cover! When they are most nervous is when they show up here! Don't fall for it! Its time to show DISMOND HANDS and hold!! $NAKD as long as it takes.
Just know that there are millions of retail stock holders rooting for you guys.
I'm suing ROBINHOOD
"I sold 10,000 shares at a price of $300, and I will buy again for only one dollar next week"
Game Over
"Most of these hedge funds shorted from the teens and the 20's!!!! It's costing them millions of dollars in interest ever day! At some point they will have to cut their losses and move on. It's basic math and science. However, they're trying every #$%$ move in the book to get you to sell. DONT CAVE IN!!!Everyone is watching this stock now and every move will have a microscope put on it. It's on a matter of time!! DONT SELL!!"
halt when it goes up. the system is so rigged
"The more the  talk, the more I wanna buy!"
I'll buy this at $1 may be.. LOL
"When you have billionaires telling you to yolo all your money in and hold, while themselves putting in the equivalent amount of a sneeze of money for them you know that you are being played by both sides. Your heroes are against you and the billionaires are all working together. If Elon musk and AOC and Chamath really believed they would never have sold out at the top and they would be buying with two hands. If Mark Cuban believes he'd be buying with two hands. Money talks. Actions speak louder than words. All these billionaire heroes to the WSB saying hodl and diamond hands have nothing invested in themselves. How can you trust people who tell you to run into the fire and don't do it themselves? Don't be blind. The rich only look out for themselves!"
Shorts have to buy our shares. We tell at what price!
"“I’m gonna hold til GME goes bankrupt.” Lol, thanks for the laugh"
One of the best pump and dumps ever underlined with a great fairy tale of retail investors revolution. Jordan Belfort must be proud.
The fundamental is not in GME. Fundamental is in ANTI HEDGE FUND ALLIANCE. They rise and fall at the same time with same pattern.
This is a good stockI like it
get in now or at 84 on Monday ;)
"Empowerment doesn't mean getting together in a mob to try to stick it to a hedge fund. Hedge funds have highly skilled people, machines, and a boatload of cash. they might lose a battle here or there, but long term, they'll win the war and clean you out....You are learning the hardway that is the case."
"All my positions (long) are closed. I have no stake! But... Wanted to chime in because I'm smarter, not richer than Cuban.You hold through rough times when there is a market crash or dip. Good stocks recover. Usually. But this is not something that's going to permanently recover. It's an anomaly. If you want to hold because you want to hold and hope and dream, I don't trash your decision. I've held junk just because it was fun to watch pennies drop to nothing. But that's your choice. Heck, I might buy some more for supporting the cause if I see short interest report, middle of Feb, showing more shorts! But for now, no. Of all these, I'd probably hold Nokia and even AMC. But, unless management turns this around, it's not going anywhere. So, enjoy the dreams. Hold if you want, but not for the reasons Cuban thinks he's promoting."
Hedge funds are using msm and social media yo harrass you into selling valuable shares they need to cover themselves.They are scared.Pay me for my valuable shares.
Yes your honor they keep throwing more money at this
"Just want to be honest, when it reaches $10, people at Wall Street bets are still gonna be chanting “hold” “diamond hands” etc .... shame on them"
I’m in at 190$ rly want it to stay this low for a nice average down
100s of millions will stand to lose millions on Monday with GME sell off.
But.... but... Mark Cuban said hold!
"Hi  , i was long with 15k i lost 8k and cut my loses im sorry , ill always remember this beautiful 3 weeks i had a rush i never got before , good luck to the holders wish you all the best in the future "
Lmao this stock died faster than Musk's Rocket
"As I've been posting, BB will soon again be trading in the $20s.Because unlike $GME, $KOSS and $AMC, this company has a positive future.At some point, the investment community will realize it ain't about handsets anymore. And by the time this happens, BB will be trading much higher. At which point the upgrades will start flowing in, which will in turn drive BB higher still."
do not sell keep buying we can do 200 at after hours just hold and buy cmon. It done before one time we closed at 190 and reached 320 qfter hours. we can do it hold and buy.
"The endless supply of crooked money and fake shares cannot be defeated. Some will have profited handsomely, but the vast majority of little guys will lose when the dust settles. Can't beat the criminals at their own game. Try a different route."
"Guys I am out now, I lost nearly 300$ per share. Very sad story, but I think I saved few buck until it drops single figure number."
$AMC $GME $KOSS NO BOTTOM and an SEC investigation. Retail fighting retail.
out of all the stocks to pump up and stick it to the hedge funds you guys choose GME...a company thats almost bankrupt and has no future and being beat by its competitors....take your little profits before this drops again because for it to go back up to 400s people need to be trading on that lvl everyday and thats not happening lol invest in stocks that's going somewhere like tesla or roku
Diamond hands!!!!
"Diamond hands, I just had a big realization. The only way down up. We can’t lose now!"
Just HOLD!!!
I will never buy GME
"Any doubt you have about holding your shares should be erased by looking at the charts of $GME and $AMC. Isn’t it strange that they are identical? Also, look at the overwhelming amount of negative press stories about the stocks. This is coordinated. They are trying everything they can. All we have to do is hold and buy when you can  "
Told you!!!!!!!!!!
"I have no horse in this race. I am not shorting this stock, I just want people who blindly got led into thinking this would be a $1000 to wake up. Please do NOT think this will come up to the 200 or 300s because it won't."
9.78% up on open this is crazy and imo we could see this hit 85.00 at close
"No, not the Short Sellers but Robinhood stole from us."
"Has anyone provided you with an exit strategy or was this a ""stick it to the man"" and nothing else plan? If you have no plan that should be your #1 priority right now.Good luck to all"
It's going to spike on Monday. I'll be conservative and say $100 but it could go anywhere if they are starting to cover.
https://youtu.be/o1DgATrkL2w
I know everyone wants to recoup whatever money you lost. It's like gambling. You get emotionally involved because you lost. Don't lose more. Just walk away and keep what you have.
I SWEAR WHY ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO SO HARD TO GET LONGS WHO LOVE THE STOCK TO SELL?!?!?!?I THOUGHT THEY ALREADY PROFITED BILLIONS!?!?!?!?Unless they truth is different????

MONDAY PREMARKET IS HUGETHUESDAY SHORT INTERES IS OVER 200%GOOD NEWS JUST COMING!!!!
Hold the line  still over 100% short. They’re still bleeding billions of dollars in interest every day. They will sacrifice everything before they finally break. We are stronger together than they think we are. They gotta buy up their positions eventually. Put your phone down take a walk and relax people.
My dog told me to lock in $10 Puts near the close. I did.
buy more
NAKD is still a buy at this price! Its projected to hit $5 EOW  buy now before it gets too expensive
"and gme didn't do an offering? with over 1 Billion dollars in debt they still didn't do an offering lol. this company must be a nonprofit. this company has to be a nonprofit. when the stock traded to $500, nothing, 400 nothing, now its under 100 and still nothing. lol ceo and board should be removed."
"O MY GOD WERE GOING RED BEFORE MARKET OPENS O MY GOD I THOUGHT THIS WAS MOON DAY.THE SKY IS FALLING, THIS CANNOT BE TRUE WHY LORD WHYYYYYYYY"
buy buy buy and wait for short squeeze
so mms expose a new way to sell regardless if there are share available or not? So basically they can short over 140% and they buy back the share aslong they want it.
"Idk who needs to hear this, but I'm still holding and will until I see the moon!"
"What I found really interesting is in the last month I received a few text from friends and all of a sudden they started telling me about AMC and all the others stocks that are just shutdown. Telling me they were good buys. They would send me pictures of trends. And one thing I kept thinking to myself how do you determine it’s good based on a line? I have read a few books about investing and still learning. I stated to my friends the best thing you can do is read a get informed. Do your due diligence. One friend responded I don’t like to read. So at the moment I saw GME I thought about buying one share. But i thought, it goes against my personal principles of investing which is long term horizon not short term gains. There is temptation. I think as Wareen Buffet said, you plant trees now for shade in the future. There is alway opportunity regardless of how the economy is. Like anything else, it takes time to learn or get a better understanding of a situation. I just hope that those who played GME and took a loss, take this as a learning opportunity to learn because I think in the long run you will become better and recognizing opportunity rather than follow hype. The biggest investment you can make is in yourself."
NAKD WENT FROM 21M shares available to borrow to 6.4M and holding strong!!  recover your losses
game stop will be the next blockbuster its a good business for the 90s its all gonna be digital from hear on out
I’ll hold this no matter how low it goes... It’s a risk no matter what side of the table you’re on... I took the chance knowing full well it would either 10x with a squeeze or fall right back down... if it doesn’t fall back to single digits I’ll be picking up a boy load more shares and sitting on them... truth is this company was massively undervalued and they are no where near bankruptcy. With an updated plan and in a sector full of money they can stay relevant for much longer. The key here was to risk an amount of money you were comfortable losing. So I’ll be holding without a single drop of sweat. I wish everyone GL. Battle is far from over.
"Can you guys stop selling...just hold. How can any of you say APE STRONG and have no mental fortitude to not sell at the first sign of adversity. You are beautiful human beings, just HOLD."

"The only squeeze happening now will be the Robinhood FOMO squeeze. The only reason it spiked from 17 to 400+ was mainly due to 140% having been shorted and shorts then 'needing' to cover when Reddit mass coordinated to bid it up to trigger and then not to sell. Hence 400. Curiously, it also involved the FOMO (fear of missing out) phenomenon, brought to you by Robinhood. The insiders thank you. Hope not too many got hurt and more were on the right side of the action but there're are no more shorts to squeeze, just each other's ballz. GME happens to be a company that's now losing money when profitable once. It's really worth no more than $5 a share, at most. It was only targeted because it 'had' an extraordinary short interest (covered and naked) of 140% (for good reason, it's a dying business model. All shorts just 'borrowed' shares that they immediately sold to bank the money with hope they'll be able to buy back the same amount of shares in the future at a cheaper price to pay back the loan (must be shares).Problem is, either the lender or the broker can demand this loan be repaid at any time or there's a margin call, since all shorts buy on margin. This esp happens when the pps spikes and the lenders now want to sell their shares now instead. That's why there's a squeeze. They're forced to cover (buy) at any price and if there're no sellers, what happens? $400+ happens and then the profit taking begins to lock them in. Hence $60 today on it's way back to 20. No broker will lend shares now, even at $60. Too volatile. But one could buy put options instead and pay the crazy insane premiums that are just not worth the risk.Bottom Line: It's a target rich environment out there and curtain has already closed on GME, AMC etc. The only curtain call will be the Maid Marion squeeze of Robinhood's nuts. Good luck with that. With her, you'll need it."

Lets test 100.. see who had the diamond hands.
HALTED AGAIN
This stock will trade to $10-20/share. It is on its way to bankruptcy. The people who are long the stock don't know anything about the company's fundamentals. It's hilarious.
Today's bubble has already deflated 50%. close will be red.
$100 by 12
"I'd also like to point out that wsb is no longer relevant to the trading of this stock. They were just the catalyst in getting everyone's attention to it. Everybody sees the reality globally, it's a naked short and naked shorts can't recover, they will lose. So it's time to leave wsb behind, there is no other info they can come up with. There will be more squeezes as this goes on, there will also be long new buyers, retail and funds. GME is not over any time soon. Why do you think politicians are getting so involved, some to the point of asking to pause trading GME for a month? Because the math behind it is bad? No. It is absolute. Hold."
Michael Burry already sold most of his GME stock ... he is just holding a few but he already pocketed the gains. This is not going to end well for the regular Joe's and Jane's trading out there.
Elon musk just tweeted. It may rocket to $200 soon
Ooof baby I’ve never loved being a shorty until I met GME !!!
Momentum looks as if it’s moving green today estimate 78-85 close thoughts
"GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) Gains +4,800% Over Our June 9, 2020 Buy Call @ $5.01 Per Share! #STONKS#YouTube Link >> https://youtu.be/WEzsWl_amjw"
This will close below $50 today. Look at the open interest on the $50 puts! They’re spiking the price so Robinhooders will chase it higher. They short it at the top...don’t do it! Buy good stocks! $ET $XLE $OXY $GEL
"I feel green will be the colour of the day, crazy kids with momentum this will likely go higher today, I have no position at all but the resistance is quite something"
Each share will be equivalent to a Wendys 4 for 4 by the end of the month.
One share ! Hold your One share with diamond hands!
A lot bashing in this stock this morning....I find that hilarious....DONT SELL....THERE SCARED!!...HOLD AND WATCH....
It cost nothing to HODL. How much interest on those short positions? No exit strategy cause NO ONE IS SELLING.  
Just bought 13 shares.
Today’s Target 75-100. Make back some losses folks!
It will be the next $GME
below $50 incoming
"The shorts have been causing huge damage with repeated lies for many years and no investigation by anyone ?!Why ?What’s the difference between pumping and causing people to lose and shorting by “sophisticated hedge funds” and stealing peoples money I didn’t buy GME as there’s no way a stock would maintain high levels with over +2000% in mater Of days or weeks .Non the less short hedge funds have destroyed companies that might have survived along with many families if the share price didn’t plummet so much What exactly short funds add to the economy just playing the numbers game.They dont produce anything , they don’t build businesses or help factories expand I understand the short argument and in someways it’s healthy. However, the rules and laws are made by corrupt investors supported by corrupt laws made by corrupt politicians"
"I thought today was moon day? They keep pushing the rocket ship to the moon day thing a day back, every day."
still a heavily bashed thread which leads me to believe they are still trying to scare everyone from their shares. Stay the course!
"Everyone moved brokers, and even the ones who sticked to RichfriendHood can buy 100 today.Watch the volume after market opens in US.Thank's for the discount; count your losses for thinking we'd lose."
Their will be so many people afraid to buy this now it will never come back
"I was short until yesterday, today I am buying... good luck longs...."
"Collapsing in AH again, and will collapse tomarrow again as well. It is OVER. Thanks for playin' Bernie Sander's supporters. Wall street appreciates your generous donations to their loaded coffers lol.Thanks."
Best tume to buy 1 share.
This is done!Better buy QCOM after it went down 9%. QCOM beat earnings yesterday and has a very good outlook on 5G.
"GME & ($40,000) Ethereum (289 Coins) Jump into Ethereum.We are literally going to $1700 USD//$2400 CAD"
Yikes
And I honestly I don't think hedge fund shorts learnt their lesson yet...it's very typical tactic....bring the price down and keep shorting it to induce the margin selling... That's what's going on today.
"GME is still shorted way above 100%, the squeeze will come. The amount of shills and bots in this chat speaks for itself. Hedgies aren't allowed to short GME today, it's no coincidence that were green."
I've never brought a stock that fundamental is not healthy but I brought GME because you guys touched my heart of this movement. I paid $324 for a share and I will keep holding it for the cause of all WSB hero's who defined the odds and fight for the justice.
"How did you people ever think this was going to $1000? You were warned so, so, so many times."
"Good buying opportunity, this will pop post market. Hold strong. Dip is only because everyone ran to $CCIV to catch merger."

"The SEC is a joke. A five-year-old could recognize the hedge fund tricks the last two days, front and center, and not a peep from regulators.Yet, three days ago, they were all howling for regulations against scary reddit and stock boards on the internet.The US Stock Market is about as legit as WWE."
tomorrow price target around 30$
got in on Bngo at .58 cent got in POLA at 5 i got in this at 100 and has went down oh well I'm learning but gotta hold now can't sell now just learning only been investing since December I work on large commercial equipment deal with 480 volts daily but this is definitely more exciting
Warned people from the beginning. insane how people thought it would hold up...
GME back to $6 and at that price it is still overvalued on a fundamental basis
Wow!!! Up so much today!
"The short squeeze has begun! $GME $SLV $CDXC Rocket ship, rocket ship, deepf**kingBrenner"
"Just sell everything. Its done, just understand that its not even enough volume to make any significant move up, except down."
Submit your complaints to the SEC here...https://www.sec.gov/tcr
UP 20% PREMARKET!!!
Well longs that went well...
BUY THE DISCOUNT WHILE YOU CAN
"Regarding GME's future price movement is hard to predict...I think it will keep trading rangebound between $50 ~$100. I'm sure shorts are trying hard to break it lower but what they still don't realize is unless they stop shorting this and cover most of the shorts, this volatility won't stop. The only thing that's currently working for shorts is there's still remaining margin calls and whenever daytraders jump in and take profits it creates another short opportunity albeit just a day or two. So pick your entry point and exit point carefully and you can still make money using volatility. In the mean time I know lots of people still lost money on GME, so I can't really say ""take your profit and move to some other stock"" However, pay attention to MPLN around 2/12 for its earnings report.MPLN is one of those heavily shorted and manipulated stocks which was also aided by one of the most bogus Muddy Waters reports. It's trading around $8 and although Yahoo says 4.65% of outstanding shares are shorted, if you back out 76% of shares hold by insiders and institutions, 20% of floats, 32.33million to be exact, have been shorted. Because MPLN's stock price is so tightly controlled I'm not sure how successful short squeeze could be but if it happens it could go to $16 ~ $23. Good luck to everyone!"
I wonder if the Market Maker is under pressure?? This dropped hard at the open and they didn't start halting it until it started moving up. It looks like they are losing control.
what is unfortunate is that Gamestop the company is unable to cash in on the run-up to reconfigure its business. I'm wondering why is it taking them so long to offer a secondary to pay off their debt.
Volume is high today
LOOK AT FRANKFURT GME
This is bad for all the poor people all over the world caught up in GME Some people paid $450The big guys shorted it again at 450 back to 60Who won in the end
This whole thing is hillarious...(Holdin 2 @245)
$400/share for a retail company that has no stores open... ha ha ha ha a
I swear $53.82 is as low as this will go today...
"These hedgies are the same people who devalue our games, our collectibles, playing cards and toys. They gawk at the idea of a $1000 grail. Let’s put an end to this archaic way of thinking and do it for our moms, dads, grandmas, and grandpas that they screwed over in the past."

"When brokerages limited or stopped the ability to buy shares in certain stocks, it didn't change the endgame, it just shortened the playtime. Stocks that rise like a rocket tend to crash like one."
"Had to take time off work for this, if all goes well maybe I won’t go back to work at all "
"A Must Read - Search Gamestop has been a debacle...“GameStop has been a debacle of epic proportions. The valuation is completely disconnected from the fundamentals. A bunch of individual investors got hurt. Now hedge funds got hurt, too. At the end of the day, I am not too worried about these hedge fund guys. They are not mortgaging their futures on whether or not GameStop [stock] works or not. Individuals investors are.”To be sure, with the short position in GameStop way down versus January the upside momentum in the stock has severely subsided this week.GameStop shares were down a total of 70% from Monday to Tuesday heading into the start of Wednesday’s trading session. The stock rose slightly in Wednesday’s session on news the company hired several former Amazon executives to lead various business functions.But the damage to the super bullish trading story has been done. The stock has crashed some 81% from its intra-day all-time high on Jan. 28, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data. It’s likely the downside pressure persists as the company’s fundamentals come back into focus as the Reddit community seeks out a new target to jawbone higher.Warns Chukumba, “Here’s the scary thing. GameStop hit a high of over $480. Now it’s down to less than $100. Last we checked that stock is worth $10 a share. There’s still a lot of downside to go. I am thanking my lucky stars I made that decision [to drop coverage].”"
"i didn't write this, but it's interesting to read!As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep #$%$ going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the #$%$ of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust.In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another #$%$ up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this #$%$ show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, #$%$ huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the #$%$ events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the #$%$ low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves."
$SNDL get in before it booms! $GME was last week!
you guys dont have the idea whats going. just buy 1 or 2 or more that you can afford and hold ! One day that will have to let this go again. Soon robinhood traders changed account or are back in the game we will see 500 + again just hold !!! Its for the message we do it not for the gain. You wanna sell for loss? Ok then you let them win.
"If this stock had no value to the shorts they wouldn’t be filling the message section with bots and shills. HOLD the line people, don’t get soft on us "

Give me just on reason WHY you wouldn't have sold above $400?
Wonder how many people lost everything on this non logical gamble of an investment? All those diamond hands turning into paper hands leaving the rest bankrupt.
"As small investors , we have just created the right environment for the big players. For the last days they pushed prices down to scare retail traders and now the real guys are coming."
Thanks again HF just scooped up more $GME and $BB Hold on the best is yet to come.
"My buy orders are salivating. Can it drop a little more, please!"
This is who Hedge Funds lost to
Trying to recoup your money? Sell this with whatever you’ve earned or still have left and put it into NAKD the market cap rate is 228 million compared to a 6 billion cap on this stock. All eyes are on this not NAKD our movement will force that stock up substantially because it takes less force to rise. The math makes sense just saying 
They are trying to play your emotions don't fall for it
It will close red today. Look out for the 70-80s. Later this week sub $50. Sell and keep your money!
"This was not a retail investor revolution against Wall Street. that was the greed of small investors. and that's the result, everyone is closest to themselves."
"CURRENTLY: After Monday and Tuesday there were $543,000,000 worth of short shares that began accruing interest BECAUSE we are finishing above their price target. If we close above $6 today another $454,000,000 of short share interest begins. 543M + 454M = $1,000,000,000 We are choking them out and the tap out is coming. That's why Mark Cuban said “Just Hold”. He knows what’s coming and so do you and I."
$$$$$$1000$$$$...who cares about the value any more....$GME is new bitcoin and $AMC the alt

"Bought 250 shares at 106. Sold at 390. Made 70 THOUSAND DOLLARS. I love the CAUSE and taking on Wall Street and all that happy horsepucky, but I like money better.Juss sayin."
holding pretty steady after hours
"Mark Cuban spent all day on WSB Reddit answering questions and called in to CNBC to support the short squeeze. Funny, not much news about that?"
not sell hold and buy its gonna blow past 200. Please hold and buy
"Why do so many of you all seem so butthurt over GME lmao? Now that it’s under $100, many of you who missed on the hype train are coming out of the woodwork to laugh about and boast about how it’s dropping back under $10. Unfortunately... it isn’t! It may get worse before it gets better, but WSB is just as optimistic about GME as they were when it was $400. They’re willing to risk it all... and when it stops getting manipulated, it will shoot right back up again. I suggest you all hop on the train and don’t miss it the second time, because then you’ll feel even more regret. There were 3-4x the amount of buying orders as sells today, AND GME, BB, and AMC had the SAME chart pattern today. This is an artificial drop. I’m not saying all this out of bias. I only have 40 shares invested with money I’m willing to lose. Just giving you all a different angle. This is a different age of the stock market now. Quit being a boomer. The “valuation” of GME means nothing."
"Sir, this is a casino."
The pyramid is crumbling.
halted LAMAO
Short position filled. Thanks rookies!
This gonna climb a bit more after lunch?
What should really bother people is the regulation that will emerge as the result of this. I've heard someone say that the end result will favor the bankers & limit free speech. I'm not sure that's a good outcome.
"Shorts thinking sorry honey, they told me it would be 40 today when it expired"
Show of hands. Did anyone see this coming?
Dont let them trick you into selling. Its only money. Who needs money when your hands are diamonds?
Book value under $15
It is not a total loss. The silly millennials got an invaluable lesson on investing.
MOON IS THE NEXT STOP
"You might be better off going to your local GameStop, buying a few games and cards, and investing in that instead."
so what's going on today?
some of the shorts will be forced to buy back in
I hope no one fell for the silver switch. That was just Robin Hood and some billionaires giving you the finger.
"I think the issue here is that such a public forum such as reddit let the hedge funds see exactly what they were doing. If the HF's were in a SHORT position, I think they would of simply reversed strategy and brought more actual shares, pumped the price up, used experience and endless market data to pick the correct exit point. $430 ish let's say ;)(Making large profits, to cover losses on 1st historic Shorts.) However then SHORTED again (at the $500 in after hours) before they Dumped the shares, and then caused the mass drop in price and the wave of ""paper hands"" to fold or triggered stop losses. I was caught in the laughter, and jokes, and euphoria for a few days, It was fun, I lost a few hundred bucks total. I'm new to investing so definitely a lesson in getting schooled by the HF's.It might go back up if there is any real substance to the Reddit theory, but I expect Hedge funds have now covered their losses or even made large profit through playing the game better."

Let's hear the horror stories. post how many shares you each bought and for how much.
"This was an opportunity of a lifetime because of the high short interest and a positive catalyst. Without the short interest, however, you need to start looking at fundamentals. If you didn't sell in the $300s or $400s, it will be something you think about for a long time, especially if it was life changing money."
Do i buy more or hold or get out & lost. I have 100 share around 105.Please give me advice. Thanks
Today will be sideways might open red just scare tactics remove emotion and use the facts in front of you it's trading 96 dollars before anyone but institutions can trade which means they are willing to pay that 96 dollars the squeeze isn't over today they will try to bore you out of your position and put extreme sell pressure only thing they haven't tried and if I was in their position that's what I would try to do
We’re not basher! We’re here to help you from these manipulative option caller. Just look at the stock price! There are no gamma squeeze they have been promising you. Now they are telling you it will go back to $170. What happen to the $1000?
Cramers tweet yesterday “dinosaurs always win” its Jurassic park in this stock switch your map to NAKD
Hi guys! I unfortunately realised a susbstantial loss on $EXPR and reinvested all on $AMC. I really think we should focus on $AMC and $GME at this point. AMC has better fundamentals long term. Just my opinion; I wish you all the best! Have a glorious day party ppl!!
I thought this was supposed to drop to $50.00 a share today?
just bought 100 shares at 65. already made $400. and this will be back to $80 soon and I will make &1500!
lol. this is what happens when you trade stocks without an exit strategy.... $1000/share is not an exit strategy.

There will most certainly be another bull run with GME. It just got way too crazy this time. Its finally a buy now in my mind. Im good. Charts see comfortable around 80 dollars. I know this will moon again in 2021.
Dow dropped. GME is still strong. Be hold.
Squeeze not sqouze yet!
Most frustrating part of this is that it looks like the big guys will still win.
"looks like, instead of closing shorts, they gathered up to short even more"
Hedge funds and professional investors make money whether a stock goes up or down.As long as a stock has movement they profit. There have been some on Reddit who made money but most have lost. Keep holding this and sooner or later you will be able to start over when this stock goes down to under 10.
50 more shares at 58.62... these fellas have to cover eventually.. i'm not on margin.
15% premarket for a nice bait lure :)
Isn't this going in the wrong direction for all you strong longs BWAAAAAAAHAAAAAAA
"at the people who bought this morning , have u not noticed the last couple days "
Hey you want to see something funny? GME lol!
Get ready for the next lift-off!
"OK, BUY now @ 89.50 -2.91 (-3.15%) After hours: 5:27PM EST,,,AND I'LL DO THIS AND WE'LL OPEN AT $500+"
"Looks like some will find out the stock market is not a video game, the hard way"
na this will be over $500 tommorow just hold and see
The momentum is down. A lot of shares are unlocked for shorting and the premium for borrowing is a lot cheaper now. We might go to 50 $ tomorrow. Fasten your seat belts.
back to the 50s
The graph looks better if you hold your phone upside down.
"Shorting over 100% float, short ladder, synthetic shares buying all need TO BECOME ILLEGAL!!!!!!!This is what you're seeing happen right now."
this is not allowed to go up
whos with me on this flight to the moon?
Chart shows great support at $4.01...
DONT PANIC SELL. these negativr comments are trying to scare you. do your own research before you make decisions you might regret.
for the longs...at what point will u feel that the bull run is over?
Sideways trading today only tactic they haven't tried is to bore you read my previous comments
Life lesson number 10 today- billionaires like Mark Cuban didn’t get rich by telling you his investment strategy
Who bought this share at $300 above? And still holding?
"Robinhood, we need help, limit sell orders. Price is dropping to rapidly. Oh, wait you don't help because we are retail investors? You don't help poor you only help rich."
you hold the line. we all win
I was wondering if the reason that they never did a secondary during the run up was that a bankruptcy was in the works prior to this fiasco.
$27 tomorrow
Put your sell stop high ! Young shorts pushing old shorts to pay cash for shares !
Help please! is it possible to take a second short position and use the borrowed shares to pay back your first short position?
I wouldn´t be surprised if we hit 100-140$ today.
I am surprised GME did not raise capital by issuing new shares when they could have.
Hold and Relax mates!! The future is bright
smart people are buying now.
My forecast: GameStop premarket opening could be higher than $900/share today ENJOY THE RIDE ! ! ! Don't forget to follow me on Twitter MrDavidNIO

LNSR SOARING NEW REDDIT STOCK GAME ON
"There was a storm recently that caused the turbulence of a short squeeze. The storm seems to have blown through and the sunshine is now revealing that the water is finding it’s own level. It’s over, and if you are one of the ones that paid over $400 for a lemonade stand that is loosing $4 per year, you’re not alone. You might get back 2 cents on your dollar, you might not, you might have shown the big boys a thing or two, or maybe not, you might have been played like a fiddle, or not. But really? Never sell? That must sound like a real toe tapper to the ones that orchestrated this whole thing.OK, so I like to mix metaphors."
"Looks like in the end, the hedge fund shorts will still come out on top!"
"If GME survives then so should JCP, Sears, BlockBuster, Radio Shack, ToysRUs. Aint going to happen folks!"
DIAMOND HANDS!!!!!!
160 viewing. Now that speaks volumes!
GME will close at $40s today. Mark my word.
Chapter 7 sure thing
13. Tomorrow?
$100 must be seen today -
hey guys i went all in at 250$....whats tomorrow price target
What is the short interest?? Im seeing 121% for GME78% for AMC and 65% for BBBY and it's dated Feb. 4th on my TD account. Article titled Top 30 high interest stocks as of Feb. 4th 2021.. anyone else see this article????
I bought around $480... should I hold? Help!
"Holding up well in AH. Unfortunately, tomorrow will be a continuation of today."
Really puzzled why Gamestop didn't issue an offering with ATH price. Missed opportunity. $400 may never come back.
"GME is fast imploding - money was made by both sides last week, so...."
"What's the final escape plan? Only fair way I out could would be an agreement to liquidate say 20% on a given date, followed by a 10% accumulate, then another 20% liquidate and so on. That might allow a degree of shared loss control to leave the position entirely."
"Options IV still in the 600's -> this is is a stellar opportunity to sell upside calls for another 2 weeks; sale of a SINGLE $150 cal contract, expiring in 3 days, sold near the high today ($50) was worth $9.50 at close, ie, a $5000 short sale would have netted as much as $4000 in a single day . . this can be repeated each day for the next two days, tons of higher out-of-the-money strike prices which are even less risky and * going short * via options is much safer / profitable than try to go long at this point"
If anyone cares the real people are over at wallstreet bets on Reddit. This is 99% shills and bots 
who bought this at over 400....
I'm shocked. I can't even bash the bulls.. Just feel sorry now.. Legit.
So many bots here begging actual shareholders to sell. Someone must really want our shares. Everyone likes this stock!!!
Up up up poor Wall Street
"If you sell now, you'll understand soon that you sold the bottom!"
"And POOF, all the GME ""wealth"" that the snot nosed day trading Robinhood kiddies had disappears in a flash!"
HOLD THE LINE SOLDIERS!!... oh wait... everyone left.. 
last chance time to sell I guess next Friday hit the 20dollar bellows
"I think given that we have close to 4.3 million depressed long, maybe makers of prozac is a good long term buy... HA HA HA"
Still holding
Panic sellers who sold at $50
Im not done. If it goes another 50% down I’ll load 1000 shares more. & I can afford to loose so shorty don’t worry for me.Its not real price what is trading. It will explode soon.
Buy/hold GME and AMC. Great Deal and big sale!
Crazy how hard a stock can squeeze when it’s trading with 200%~ of the float short
"If you want to invest, buy around $10; if you want to die or give away your money, then ...Congress: GME is not a casino!"
Im down 100% and im not leaving
"What’s the logic to have bought this stock over $350, didn’t sell, and now is under $100. This has been entertaining. I wonder if the reddit dude shorted at over $400 and now he’s $300 profit each share. Someone made millions from this."
"Selling my position now. When the media companies are reporting on it, it’s already over. Luckily doing so with a profit"
"Just about to lock in $35,000 into GME! It’s time for us to eat"
I can't watch anymore... the small bounces are just shorts covering to lock in gains...
"See you at $3000 SEC need to stop this obvious manipulation. It's insane, thousands of paid shills/bots, pre/post-market manipulation, fake news and short-ladder-attacks. Doesn't matter though, they're trading with themselves while we hold. GME is still shorted way above 100%, the short squeeze will come any day now."
where were these halts when it was dropping yesterday?
"Is GameStop still a buy? Heard they will sell games, online!"
"just one share, but here supporting the cause. The wolf of wallstreet approves."
"People think now that no restrictions stock will go up, but Robin Hood had reduced restriction the last few days and melts goin down 50%. Once RobinHood was manipulated and shut it down the momentum was sunk and it was game over."
I think all these bear posts just make us have fomo over buying more now that we all know they are bots
Gme sell10 million shares at 200 and when stock falls back at 20. Go private
To the moon

I had 2-3 of my co-workers pushing me to buy GME. They said it will possibly reach 1000 as the forums were saying. They are still holding till this day. And even buying more all last week on the dips. I’m so glad I didn’t listen to them. I must say it was tempting.
"Frankfurt, around $53 usd"
Its either GME or BB tomorrow. Whats your recommendation?
Its a losing game but put s a HUGE magnifying glass on the corruption. Restrictions will probably be back on soon
"$200 2/5 calls sold for $10 at open, traded to low of 1.70 - that's why selling calls is STILL the best strategy for this stock, at least the next 2 days, possibly all of next week as well; the $450 to 300 price swings have all played out, typical will trade in the range of $25 - maybe $50 over the course of a day, volume way down over last week"
This was slowly take all your money. I got out 400. AMC 21. Express 13. It was fun thanks. Put your money in real stocks. I like ford.
GME is doubled from the low! Get in quick for much higher! Buy GME and AMC
Last chance below 100
"Short squeeze big time tomorrow, bank it"
literally everyone is selling except like 500 reddit kids still holding their 3 shares each
"cant believe people fell for this scam that the media, politicians, etc set you up for. now they will make regulations in the name of ""protecting the little investor"" so that it is even harder for you to make any money in the stock market while they continue to get rich."
shorted shares are 10-20$ we need to keep this going up constantly. Keep buying guys we shall win
"The Morning AfterThere's got to be a morning afterIf we can hold on through the nightGME has a chance to find the moonLet's keep on looking for the lightOh, can't you see the morning after?It's waiting right outside Robinhood Why don't we cross the buy/sell gap togetherAnd find a place that's profitable and warm?It's not too late, we should be buyingOnly with buying can we climbIt's not too late, not while we're livingLet's put our funds out in timeThere's got to be a morning afterWe're moving closer to the moonI know we'll be there by tomorrowAnd we'll escape the darknessWe won't be fighting hedge funds anymore!"
Are we still going to $1000 a share ?
"Look at this where is all the money pouring in from, it’s amazing, these kids with their social media are likely to lift this today,boho knows where this will end today, but without doubt green day"
"But of advice if you are long in this. Stay off the message board these people are paid bots majority of which seem to be boomers. So think about how sad their life is before taking advice from them knowing full well that after all those years this is the only way they can make money. Pandemic or not, that’s a pretty sad existence in my eyes."
"You can all have your fun with GME and the other Reddit stock plays. And I hope each of you make a fortune with your gambling. For me, a 40 year old timer investor, I will continue with my simple minded multi-year boring long-term hold of GOOG and the other FAANG stocks. Certainly many ways to make and lose money in the stock market. GLTA"
"Wow $57, longs... Don't think of it as a crash. Think of it as a 4:1 stock split, you just aren't going to get 3:1 of the shares for a long long time... ha ha hahahahaa"
"I am betting big on REITs that have a lot of bachelor apartment complexes. With all the dudes getting kicked out of their houses after losing it all on GME, the bachelor apartments will be a hot commodity!"
Strong sell
"To be fair these kids are more switched on than we ever were 35 years ago playing Atari, they have disposable income and access to leverage with instant connectivity throughout the world, add to that disillusionment and they have massive support base to call on. You only need look at the Reddit accounts created this last month. Ponzi scheme yes, but with support"
Shorts stating the obvious As if nobody expected this to drop smh
Not dropping further is a victory. Best of luck to you brave souls.
"Game Changer..On Wednesday, GameStop announced that it appointed Matt Francis to the newly-created role of Chief Technology Officer, who most recently was an engineering leader at Amazon Web Services."
"Won't let me post CNBC link to story indicating that institutional investors were primary drivers behind GME mania, I am simply shocked . . ."
Should I get into this buying frenzy?
Game over
Someone flipped a switch
What’s the criteria to halt trading?
New to investing and just watching the craziness. Question: How could the stock possibly jump again? Wouldn't most retail investors have their money in the stock already?
What time this thing goes up?
How many millions in interest hedge funds paying daily now?
diamonz handz
Add more on Dips And hold Don't Sell
"GME started this when it was around $10. So, the stock still has room to fall another 90%"
I would brag about getting out at 447 but I would be attacked.
Sharp rebound coming!-stock king
"Everyone should jump in and buy whatever they can afford at this price. If your on the sideline and the infinite short squeeze starts, you will forever regret it. This is a once in a generation opportunity."
Hold! Last week was just hype. The real gains are ahead
Wow! My brokerage account showing all green today.....all stocks are up. That doesn't happen often. Something somewhere must be falling......I think I know what.
Put buyers busy I guess. Honey i was sure it would be 20 30 40 50 today
Buy buy buy buy you won't regret
What is the best free source of current short interest?
Time to get out and buy puts. This is doing to go back to new lows by end of day
52 week high was $483. I feel sorry for the guy that bought those shares - unless it was a short covering.Reality is GME is a sub $20 stock and the company is likely headed for bankruptcy.
If this ever drops to 65 I'll be buying.
"Ok - so there will be 1 or 2 mini peaks at over $60 in the next 30 minutes or so. Then the stock will break below $55 and flounder there for 20-30 minutes and then take a hard break below $50 and close somewhere in the low $40s for the day.Grab those $60 sells while you can. If you are fast you may be able to grab a couple $55 buys and sell at $60 to recoup a few bucks, just be careful you don't get caught holding - take $59, don't be greedy."
Shorts complaining their getting absolutely cooked in their mommies basements!
Halted again cover shorts cover Run run!! Hahahahaha
What's sadder to watch is the number of people standing on the sidelines laughing at retail investors getting pummeled instead of banding together to accuse hedge funds and trading platforms (the big boys) of FRAUD/market manipulation/stopping the free-market from working the way it's supposed to. This is like watching the movie The Big Short and having the audience ROOT FOR THE BANKS.
hold' till your the only one left.
Only down 40% today! Awesome! ;)
"welcome back, robinhooders! let's go!!!!"
"3 golden crosses in 5 days, another about to happen today. if you play your cards tight this is a momentum play of the century."
i be a millionaire if i get a dollar each time this stock gets halted
"Sweet i am not scared, buying more "
Look on the bright side guys. No more triple digit losses now
is it time for xbio.it has 8.75 million share float.if robinhood and reddit start on it it will go 100 points easy
NEW RULES> >> GME IS NOW RESTRICTED FROM SHORT SELLING!!!! HOLD!!!!
Don't worry. Your helicopter parents will replenish your accounts. Then they will lie to their friends and tell them you made a fortune when you got out at 480.
"Feel so bad for these bag holders man, pumping each other up to hold, not realizing this game is long over. Enough people have lost interest and have moved on. RH lifted the restrictions today and still stuck at 60, what does that tell you? Move on, it's over."
450 comin’
"sold all my other positions and bought more on the dip at 90, back up already "
"On Wednesday, GameStop announced that it appointed Matt Francis to the newly-created role of Chief Technology Officer, who most recently was an engineering leader at Amazon Web Services."
the same people telling you to hold were selling you their shares..
JUST HOLD
"short to recoup, this is done. furthermore that pump will take a huge toll overall on this company. bankruptcy is definitely in the future."
"$amc is everywhere two locations close to my home, one that is walkable. $gme is everywhere two locations close to my home 1 mile and 2 miles. These are going concerns. Open your eyes and see the truth. You are investing in good companies."
How in the he double L is GME and AMC stocks charts the same last 5 days
This is hilarious!
I like this stock
$GME folks should switch to $AMC to join forces together.
"The sad part is there will be people who get burned with this, and who will ""never trust the stock market again"". .....all because they didn't use common sense in GME. Sad."
"Gerold, that was true from the beginning. Shorting for the private investor requires multiple capital in reserves because short squeezes occur because of many different reasons. Mhld"
why is everyone in this feed screaming for others to sell? Why do you even care? Probably guys with weak hands who sold with a loss who can't stand this stock going back up the coming weeks. Hold the line.
If you have a nick name you are most likely under water. Fun fact !
"Like I said the hedge fund lost was all temporary, they reshorted at the tip of the chart plus with put options. They are all rolling on the floor laughing at the retail investors ."
"Obviously this fall from grace was going to happen. The question was only when. I wanted to short, but personally didn't have the appetite in case it kept going up. Realistically it will fall to 5-15$ range, and even then I would still consider it priced favourably."
closing price $225 >:]
"New trading rules coming. You can buy a stock or sell a stock, that's it. No options no shorting, no roulette table."
Was this Occupy GameStop or was it the rich Occupying millennial wallets? I can't tell. Same thing I guess.
"If you paid more than $20 for this stock please consider giving to your local food bank next time or another good cause you can stand behind. They need it, and you obviously shouldn’t have it."
Every time I refresh the page it drops .20 cents lol
Over 100 today
pump up the volume
Hedge funds take cover!!
And just so you know $gme worked so well because they didn’t see it coming. Hedges learned from their mistakes and corrected and adjusted. They broke the law and stole our money. They think it’s part of the game. They manipulated they market and controlled the people that do. With $GME they were blindsided. With $AMC they saw it coming. Crooked system geared towards the people that can pay to manipulate people.
"Please EVERYONE in this forum, how much have you made/lost in the past year in GME?"
How many federal relief dollars ended up buying GME stock? LOL
everyone should leave the Robinhood platform. that'll make a statement.
"It’s over Melvin, just give up paper bitsh boi"
Anyone who’s on the ledge please come back in. It’s only money !!
The 70s
This is a peculiar gamma squeeze.
should I go all in on this? people said it was going to $1000
"I'm still holding the line, Who is with me??"
"No Doubt, I read, people have been moving their money to brokerages that allow trading on this stock. I expect they are now buying freely, with no restrictions, and it has become clear that having been stopped in the first place was WRONG."
Robinhood! We want to thank you for standing against the retail investor! Job well done!
$AMC $GME Can’t hold gains. Slow bleed. Lower lows.
"I think I figured out the algorithm WallStreetBets is using. Find the junkiest company you can find that isn't even open for business, and then convince 4.3 million lemmings that it's a good buy.....Seemed to have worked...."
Fact is people has been shorting from 450$ to 50$. They have to close their positions and buy. So now buyers and even past sellers are buying. So the volume is BUY
From $500 to $60. This is a once in a life time bargain. Buy low sell high.
"Poor shorts are going to try to close their positions, only to met with diamond hands. And they’re gonna pay the diamond price!"
Reddit pumpers don't complain about the market being rigged when you lose your money. This is your own fault. There are no Wall Street people or hedge funds left to blame for you following a crowd of pumpers.
It's PARTY TIME!!!!!!!!
Jaret Yellen’s meeting has not created any significant impediments to $GME! I am long and expect the stock to come out of its 72 hour shadow
"If you think about it, stocks are just an elaborate ponzu scheme. Values are created out of nothing. And never be at the bottom of the pyramid."
This will be back up to 400
"$5.00 soon for a company with no earnings, $4.22 loss per share in the latest quarter!!"
Picked up shares after hour because my charts scream 400
The 50s up next
According to the charts drop coming in t-minus 45min
Strange times indeed. Never thought I'd see such overt corruption. One sided trading should be illegal.
SOO MM... 74m VOLUME AND IT STAY FLAT!!!
"Dropping another $10,000 on this ticker if we open below $150"
Bears? Hello?
If you paid 100 200 300 400 u might as well hold now . I would call for the shares and use them this summer to light the grill
Here’s the GOOD NEWS with the increased of the stock price GME can now pay you 0.25 for your used games
THOSE WHO SELL NOW DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT STOCKS. GME IS NOW ON THE SHORT RESTRICTION LIST. JUST HOLD AND BE PATIENT
Timber
So the story is that a couple of traders like DFV took the millions of the hedge funds and pocket them. After 20years in the front of their screens trading sounds fair. Now probably are shorting GME.
Next Tuesday will really show which way we will be going. Respects to those who are still holding. $EXPR $AMC $GME $KOSShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZcwbfNur9o&ab_channel=JeffreyForbes
Volume super lowNo one selling but we need buys Not financial adviceJust like stonk
"Alright, let’s get GME to $1000, then after they do a 10:1 split, we’ll drive it up again"
hold......the.... line
Brokerages getting fees for double lending this stock should go down and be put out of business.
they keep halting this .... that should tell you something
I bought 10 shares @ 200....hard earned money lost...lesson learnt.
"Green today looks the order of today ,do you think at open , how many times do you think will be halted today on rise"
It’s amazing that people buy a 10$ stock for a hundred!!!!
frankfurt is down...12%
id much rather risk losing it all than to sell at these low prices and regret it for the rest of my life when it rockets back up
"good luck short people. our diamond hands will not let you go, you can wriggle a little more, but the time to pay off debts is approaching at the speed of light. We have nothing to lose.Shares Outstanding 69,746,960Shares Short 61,782,73088.58%Short Interest(%)the numbers don't lie"
"Rough estimates put 68% of GME shares in the retailers hands, keep it up kids !!"
Game Flop ....
im down 100k
still have 2 hours left and share price going up. Their covering is bringing it up
Any suggestion for buying ?
Way too many bots around lol
"Brokerages should invoke a rule that says anyone born after 1985 cannot open a brokerage account. ""For your protection."""
I wouldn't be surprised if this ended poorly today
So this is going up to the $200-$400 range again? Ever?
Now we have new shorts coming in I love this stock! Game on
HOLD!!
Here we go ..... to the moon!
Hey Hey!Under $54!GAME OFFICIALLY OVER! (so to speak)
"whos covering today, be sure to share your losses"
Ladder attack was real. Never seen so many bs illegal trades between each other before. Low volume with such a price drop when the buy greatly outweighs the sell. Don’t be a paper hand do some research on how the stock of being traded and relax. Wsb has shown plenty of stats showing how they’re trying to scare people away from holding. Just like the bs silver pump that had nothing to do with wsb and was totally artificial by the media
On our way to $250
"GME, GSAT and SCR are all green and looking good AH!!"
I’m holding to see what happens. Any loss is well worth watching these hedgies run around trying to figure out how to get back the BILLIONS they lost. So I’m ok paying thousands for this entertainment lol
any chance we see 60 tomorrow?
"@Richard when the rule of investment is broken and distorted by power , the enforcer should after one who broke it , in this case is shortest who did 150% shorting and as who follow the rule of the investment /game should be rewarded , in this case is people who buy stock for investment. And I often wonder if power is everything, why do we need rule ? And guess what , I can wait , no margin call for me"
diamond hands!
How’s everyone who bought above $300 feeling ?
The WAR resumes......
"“Clearly, both sides ($AMC / $GME vs hedge funds) are playing a giant game, with the stock market as the game board,” said Pam Krueger, founder and CEO of Wealthramp, a referral service for financial advisers"
jordan belfort spoke on his insta about throwing a big chunk into one of the meme stocks .he didnt clarify GME or AMC
"One Hedge fund :- why no one selling? Do we need do something else to force them to sell? Second Hedge fund:- If we do anything, we will get caught, our own employee part of this movement."
so from what I read the shorts don't have expiry date as long as they pay interest if that's correct they will wait out to all the hype ends that might take weeks or months I don't know what I'm talking about anyone can tell me if this the same situation with GME
The hottest tier 4 penny share $CHUC Charlies holdings. @ 0.009 you can easily triple your money.
$sls is next
Buy in the dip!
Why would customers go through gamestop when everything is setup electronically? consoles are dead! dvd's have been dead! GME is like the next blockbuster
Wonder what hedge funds are paying the short shills in here. Probably like 5 cent a post lmao.
Many people warned but not many listened. See this stock back at 20$ in a few days. No one is your friend and no one cares about the “movement”Grow up this isn’t Monopoly money.
"The whole thing is being manipulated. I've seen some users reactions here during these 2 weeks and it went from ""take down the billionaires"" to ""take down the retail investors"" way too quickly. The whole thing feels fake and not organic at all. This is truly leading me to believe our whole reality is fabricated. I truly enjoyed last week as it felt like a real global movement against the people that ""own"" us. It's way too weird.Anyways, I still think GME is a solid long-term investment. Ryan Cohen knows how to turn things around and I can see GME in triple digits again in a couple of years."
"If you bought in at 400+ and expect to see it again, I can guarantee you that you won’t see this thing getting to 400 again. I expect it to drop to 40-60 in short term, and if the company doesn’t go down and under, it should reach 100-120 max within a year or two"
I want to get a job halting stocks.
Shorts:
03/02/21 08:48:07Last price 61.85 (Euro to USD $74.40)Change to prev. day -30.05%
"Shorters and inmoral big players spred panic. Dont read then, juast put your order in a fair price no less than 150"
Bye bye shorties day traders are back
If you didn't sell in the $400s because you wanted to maintain solidarity with the other diamond hands on reddit....well.....you got played.
I feel really bad for the kids who transferred money from their savings accounts and bought at $300 thinking it would go to the “Moon” this will be $6 on Thursday.
"Magic 8 Ball says buy and hold! Its going to 10,000 per share! We are all rich!!!"
LEEETS GOOOO
"One more day with $100 down, it will go under Zero. How many Reddit members became bagholders from this scam pump and dump scheme? A lot for sure."
The fall before the squeeze!
Back to $100 - $150 if longs don't sell and clients from Brotherhood and other brokers start to jump in at this price since they are allowed to buy GME this morning.
Hold or sell?
"Man, times like this reminds you that the stock market is very unforgiven. It will make you humble very fast. These hedge funds used all their ammos to manipulate and drive down GME price. It's not even funny."
I just can not help myself but buy more 
"Robinhood finally removed limits, after it all but burns to the ground and investor confidence is shaken. Draw your own conclusions."
This stock will at about 8 a share by mid next week.
I Still Ain’t Selling 
"So SADMore retail investors getting trapped today as has as 90 to 95 on a stock soon going to $15 to 420 range.Very sad situation, please sell GME and buy WKHS, or if too speculave buy ZOOM ZM a real company with a real future."
Love how they halt it went normies making money but when we get crushed in pumps and dumps the SEC is nowhere to be found
"reality is WS shorted this stock at when it was 400, they recovered more than what they lost at this point"
Why they halting
Let's do it! 80$ in 10 min!!
Crypto billionaire 10 million share buy in at GMELink https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-gme-amc-share-price-sell-or-hold-the-line-on-reddit-stocks
The SEC should address the GameStock frenzy EXACTLY how it addresses billionaire hedge fund managers and shorters such as Citron Research when they buy millions of shorts AND THEN MANIPULATE the stock price by publishing negative articles (even if fake) about the companies they shorted. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE? THE SEC DOES NOTHING TO STOP WALL STREET BILLIONAIRE CRIMINALS FROM MANIPULATING STOCK PRICES SO THAT THEY CAN ROB RETAIL INVESTORS.
took a shower and we jumped $12.00 premarket
But I thought it was going down to $20 today? What happened bears? You all were so confident.
"The future is bright for gme.If you bought high, holding is free.This week the squeeze may happen.Many things in play with gme all good news.Ryan Cohen still had not responded to the shorts decimating stock price.I am holding and waiting to see how cohen responds."
We up. Yes to $500 baby
"News flash, the diamond is the ring pop you can buy at the convenient store for 25cents"
I had 40K and I bought stock when it was 40 on margin. I didn’t sell at 800K. Now I’m mastrbating in my room and thinking the chart every second. Don’t be greedy
"I""M new HERE can anybody tell me if this is a good buy?"
THIS STOCK WAS A SHORT AT $4!!!
Im just waiting for this to go back up to 500 bucks a share so I can buy it. Ok guys got to go their saying light out here at the dorm's. College was so worth it.
I would like to hear folks opinion in thread:1) how much do you think this stock is really worth?2) what’s is that 1-3 months price target?Just want to hear folks opinion

"Daddy, tell me that story again about the 3 days you were a paper millionaire."
I advise everyone to buy more. You’re not going to get the chance at this price for much longer. Ryan Cohen is going to make GameStop great again!
"In case you longs want to know, (I am a forger long) hedgefunds contacted WSB millionairs and bought them off to sell and leave and then get rid of the Reditt board. All a scam. They do not care for anyone but themselves. Wake up to the internet. They say one thing, do another and you know nothing about the truth."
"For those that who still own GME, maybe you can make some of your money back if you sell all your shares, and then buy some puts."
"lads this wont go higher, the hedge funds are too strong like we have seen. SEC is not on our side, get out"
All anti hedge fund stocks started to rise. Next big wave is coming soon.
THE LOUDER BEARS GET THE MORE SCARED THEY ARE
Why the hedge funds likes to short? I know why. because they love their short pen1s. lol.
I will consider buying gamestop if it dips to $3.25
"When we get under 10, I'm buying in big time to get in on the class action suit."

"LETTTTSSS GOOO! Good day today, soon to the moon "
Last two days it was green in pre market but rode down into the red
To anyone who purchased GameStop sub 100 and was able to sell and turn a profit.Congratulations you played the game right. To all who bought in post 100 or higher and are now seeing your hard earned money disappear you need to realize that this was never about sticking it to the man. This was about making money and taking that money out of your pockets.

"Dmn so many bots here (all paid pennies by hedgies) tell em to give you a raise.The I told you so botThe sentimental botThe fear inducing bot The disinformation botSo many bots lol.Reddit users:Nah, I have time.I’ll just hold"
Going to the low single digits for this fantasy. almost bankrupt company!!!
Clearing houses are blocking buys of $AMC and $GME so their hedge buddies can buy in at a lower price!! Don't play they're game! HOLD the line!! They are manipulating the markets again!

"When you have been around as long as I have, October 1987, then you have seen these stock frenzies before notably the Tech Boom and Bust in 2000. I knew that this latest craze by the Reddit crowd would end badly. No one and I mean no one ever beats the crooks on Wall Street. Good effort though!"

Reddit is the main scam. Professional team behind the curtains instigated this movement and used millions amateur traders in their favor. And these naive amateurs were imagining they are great warriors who is near to defeat a HF Beasts. Delusion... Amateurs did not realize they were professionally played out. It is
"To avoid shot people/hedge fund people or brokerage borrow your stock and sell it right away to bring the price down, you need to set high price(highter than you bought with your expectation profiti.e 1000 or 900), so no brokerage/instituation can lend your stock out to short people to sell and bring the price down!! in another word, avoid they using your owned stock to sell and bring the price down"
No one truly knows where this will actually go tomorrow.... haha
"Buckle up, tomorrow is going be interesting"
When will this be $700?
"I have been posting this on Yahoo msg board and it keeps getting deleted..WHY? They are Scared! THIS NEEDS TO BE VIRAL!! PLEASE!! TRUTH!! #NOK #GME #SNDL #BB #BBBY #AMC LOOK AT THE CHARTS!!!! The 27th! ALL DID NOT SHORT SQUEEZE, Retail bought! SQUEEZE UPCOMING!"

"Hi guys, firstly I would like to say that it is an honor to fight by your side, in this epic war.Today was a good day, I take advantage of the situation and I bought more.I would like to underline some aspects:1) It seems that a lot of people are HOLDING $AMC and $GME, and the HFS are, day by day, more terrified of what is coming;2) More we hold, more the interest of the shorts increases;3) IF WE CONTINUE TO HOLD, ALL TOGETHER, the HFs will be constricted to buy;4) The ancient technique of ""holding"", is the only one which permits you to win;Have a good dayGuLdo"

green is always good.
"If I won big last week with GME, why would I come on this chat just to mock the people who still have hope? I wouldn’t, I’d take my money and be happy. Something is off, don’t trust these people on here posting telling you to sell"

With regulators watching this under a microscope shorts and there brokerage house are under scrutiny. January 28 will be throughly reviewed ! One share hold if you can’t hold do not but others will.
And here come the dip. Another non-regulatory halt so options could be dumped.
"SSR in effect. Short laddering and naked shorting limited. If GME continues to climb to $120 ny the end of the day pressure will be on shorts.Longs hold your gold. Pressure is all on them. More PUTS in place. Latest PR GME wants to go big. Blackrockput their stake in AMC, 5.7% ownership. Shorts are running scared and are desperate. Never bet against WallStreetBets and the retail investors. We've had enough and were not taking it anymore~!"
"I am sorry to say this but even if all of WSB jumps into this now with the hedge funds slowing down their short position there is no way some of you that hopped in at $350-$400 are going to see those prices ever again.. Not for a while anyway.. Fundamentally this stock is the Blockbuster of the gaming industry.. Why use game stop when you have walmart, bestbuy, Nextgen digital copies, Amazon, etc etc etc.. And on top of that some of those retailers provide a better discount.. It was dope to see WSB collectively make the giant bleed, but monsters learn from their mistakes and adjust accordingly.. ESPECIALLY IF THEY LOSE BILLIONS.. I hope some of you cashed out and were able to change the trajectory of your family's finances... Those of you that didn't I am truly sorry for your loss."
GME as car
"People lost a lot of money on this stock. Why you guys are not investing in UWMC, BFT, ORMP, where you can make some money. UWMC is really very low an it is a new IPO."

ELON MUSK SAYS ABOUT GAMESTOP!!!!!!ON TWITTER!!!!!!
holding forever translates to holding for two days max 
"freeeeee........freeee falling!!!!!! why would people buy a $3 stock for over $300 per share? dont buy a stock that you dont have confidence in their management, infrastructure, business model etc and so forth! instead of blindly following the herd on reddit, spend the time that you have living in your parents house rent free and do some better homework and learn more about the stock market. instead of trying to go ""viral"" on tiktok maybe find a job and contribute to society. not necessary to go to college unless you are going to be a doctor/lawyer etc because you can learn so much about investing online. but you have to earn money to be able to invest your money. even with democrats in office; they are not going to send out stimulus checks monthly."
"LOT OF NEWBIES LEARNING A HARD LESSON. But that's OK, as long as you actually learn from it and are relatively young."
Trying to decide on what I’m going to do with my life after I’m rich from GME hitting $1000
Who bought at $95? 
Who is still holding the bag ?
"the caught-out hedge fund shorts were forced to cover 100% of the GME float at $1,000, that would cost about $50 billion (because $1,000 times 50.65 million shares is just over $50 billion).But the short float in GME remains above 100%. That is because, even as some hedge funds have closed out of their GME shorts, others have reshorted again, in hopes of winning the epic battle with the Reddit army to prevent the squeeze.If, say, the shorts had to cover 120% of the share float at $1,000 — in order to cover the short float — that would be a sum greater than $60 billion, rather than $50 billion.If the price were squeezed above $1,000 per share, the final cover price, forced by the brokers, could be even more than $60 billion. It could be a price tag so high, in fact, that not only would multiple large hedge funds go bust, a number of brokers and possibly even banks could get taken out alongside them."
"I have a question: When you short a stock, you GET PAID, instead of paying, for the shares at Market Price. My question is: who pays you? Where does the money come from? Who is the counterparty to the trade?"
Bounced again off at 74 dollar. Just like yesterday afternoon
I bought 2 shares. I considered this a charitable contribution...
100 any time
$GME to the moon!!!!
"Reddit/GME did 2 things, left more bag holders than any other stock in history, and taught retail investors the power and how much money can be made shorting a stock. I used to get 5:1 likes to dislikes when I posted a short position, now I get 5:3. Longs beware. It’s coming."
keep buying so we can short this again tomorrow
"The longer you hold, the higher it goes. Simple economics really"
I just went to Fintel to see what the SHORT VOLUME RATIO is now at on GME and it is the only stock that doesn't give me the option to find out. Can anyone explain or tell me what it actually is now.
Guys as of tmrw NYSE is restricting short selling on GME
Halt on the way up but not on the way down?
I was reading all these reddit comments about shorts having to cover expired positions on Tuesday and Wednesday. Gamestop was supposed to skyrocket to the moon. What happened?
Can someone explain the game plan to me please? I get the whole short squeeze thing but i am kinda watching from the outside and observing the situation. Are the reddit guys and gals still winning with the current price at 90 or is the battle over and its going back to a normal level?
How can a stock go to $400/share when all the stores are closed make no money?Common sense seems to escape people these days....
Has the Reddit crowd yet realized wall street hedge funds made the majorityof the GME profits both long and short this past month?

I feel like last weeks run up was all based off of hype but now it’s just back down to its price before...still getting ready for the squeeze around 80-90
Elon Musk said: Today is the last time he could help to pump GME. Sell now before it drops to its true value of $13/s. Elon is very busy. He will not spend time to play GME game .
"don't get fooled, when day traders are done this is falling more"
Under $50 tomorrow as predicted......
Everybody together! What goes up.... (fill the blank)
Never expected to go this low again but hey thanks I was able to purchase a fully 1k shares will ride this up at 400
Look at the trades they are still walking it down. Don’t get scare tomorrow they can’t short and we will see this rise again. Don’t sell
Last one please turn off the lights.
"this Carson block along with the other manipulating hedge funds keep forgetting to mention how they manipulate the market with synthetic shares, short ladder attacks, shorting over 100% of float."

more and more people lose interest in risking their money for this scam that is happening....the faster it is going to plummet soon
120 at close would send a message to short sellers
Thousands if not Millions of $1400 Stimulus checks going straight into GME.
"Current GME holders - If you dont sell the price will come back. Despite all the theories, supply and demand is still the factor that determines the price no one can change that."
Why’s the volume so low?
I’m still seeing 121% short interest. Can anyone else confirm?
Sell half move to AMC
If you are smart you will sell into any rally... its a sub $5 stock and just like it dropped $400 in a week it will go back to dropping again.
So after GME and AMC plummet....Now RH is removing restrictions to purchase shares...Funny how that is
Holding 
The sad part of these bagholders is even when gme hits 11 bucks they will still scream. KEEP HOLDING!! 
if you think $10 thumbs up if you think $100 thumps down
Hold gme let’s get it to 100 today 
Guys they r still short!!!!
ALL RESTRICTIONS TAKEN OFF. WE CAN BUY AS MANY SHARES AS WE WANT.
"Bought at the break of $150 2 days ago but sold when it went down at $128.. From that point it went downhill.. This is over no hype, no short to squeeze, people have moved on. Don't be a hero WSB as made their money they won't help you now"

The odds seem stacked against retail for the time being, eg there’s been a lot of selling these past two days. I think many have exited, but I myself would like to hold and see where this goes, at least until next week when the updated short interest is disclosed"
It’s not over. Buy
"I'm not selling, even a single share. Ryan Cohen is transforming Gamestop. I can wait years! I'm waiting on the moon. Yesterday GME hired three top talents from Amazon and Chewy, I've plenty of time to see this story unfold and I'll do it while being a shareholder and probably buying more when I spot a compelling price point, which I'm already spotting nonetheless. How Gamestop can be valued just $5bn with annual revenues to top $9 bn in 2020 (with e-commerce now 25% of sales growing 300%) is simply a mistery. I'm drinking my the and relaxing, guess it will be an unbeliveable story, short squeeze or not. I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice."

Brothers and sisters. I have gme shares but we need to support amc too
Short never realize the pain of holding the stock during ladder attack 
Remember this always -.Nobody ever lost money taking a profit.
Easiest 90% I'll ever make in the stock market and it only took a week too by the time this closes at 30 tomorrow.
"I love reading all these articles about how WSB is ""empowering"" the little guy of that 4.3 million group...Here's reality....When a HedgeFund loses money on a transaction, they can go back with another reserve of funds...

Game over.... and the first time gambler is now stuck with a non-dis chargeable debt that will go on your credit file, making it very difficult for you to rent a house, buy /lease a car, or even sign up for a new cell phone... Yup, you're pretty much f...d.."

What is the reddit army pumping next?
"GME is done, now if time to cash in and start investing in real stocks. (GE)My personal favorite is (GE) General electric. I think it has an easy 100 percent upside within 1-2 years.With GE making profits again although rather small, they have definitely turned the company around. GE is in 4 major division. GE Engine, Medical, Electricity, Renewable. With its 3rd and 4th quarter stock now in the positive again and the possibility of aviation coming back again with the administration pushing for green energy. I think GE can be a definite long term buy from here."
$GME $AMC SEC has launched an investigation into Reddit WSB and the pump and dump scheme. It’s all over the news. Trying to pump $3 stocks for AMC at $10 and GME at $90-400. SEC investigations never good for a stock.
GameStop stock will soon become a collectors item like expensive art
Holding until target price of 50k
steong resistance at 70 other securities are dropping. all eyes are on GME
just average down until it is 0. you cannot lose.
Tin foil hat Yellen says we are in a crisis? We setting records on every index. She is out of touch!
GAME START NOW!!!!!
We are smart! It’s happening boys. Gamma squeeze just like we predicted
"GME is bankrupt...Leading to a total of over 783 stores closed in the last two years. Those closing are about to ramp up, big time. During an earnings call with investors. GameStop revealed it plans to close over 1,000 stores by the end of the fiscal year, which ends on April 1, 2021"
"Trading alt only when rising, when cratering during last 5 sessions nobody bothered to alt trading; they call it ""par condicio"". I'm not a financial advisor, in fact I could not compete with shortie advisor. This not financial advice. Don't trust those who aren't disclosing."
This is a $20 stock. Way inflated price and next earnings if not before reality will set in. The REDDIT game hurts the average investor. The big hedge funds will survive. The REDDIT thing is dangerous as it not about true value in a company.
"Hey folks, I lost a little over $3000 oN GME. It’s not much, not as high as some folks lost.Just offering my OP here, I’m in no way a financial specialist or someone whom offering financial advice. And I could be wrong in everything I am saying please do your own research as well and not wholly depend on everything I say here.I was reading online somewhere that GME had already offered (75,000,000) Common A shares for sale back in December through Jeffries. Link to the SEC document listed below.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520312805/d67321d424b5.htm#supprom67321_7As you all know, the company will need money to restructure, remodel, and revamp whatever you prefer to call it.• Is it possible they ended up selling huge amount of shares without a need for secondary shares offering news because it had already been done back in December.• Is it possible that GME short float info we have could be compromise and inaccurate???• Is it possible that GME sold some of those 75m shares while the price was high, therefore helping those Short Sellers cover and we being left bag-holding??As some of you know $KOSS DID EXACTLY THAT, company had a cap of about 29-30m prior to the short squeeze. And they unloaded a lot of their shares on us while we were trying to UPHOLD their stocks.$KOSS family/ company made about 45m or more from their shares sale during peak squeezes.I’m all for supporting a company, through fair pricing and upholding them.At what point should we stand back and really analyze the mechanics at play?During the peaks I remember GME CEO or someone had said he didn’t know anything about the ongoing “SQUEEZE”.If he had spoken on it or said “hold the line” or “I support retail investors” whatsoever, I’m pretty sure given they had offered shares for sale they could have been held liable for losses."
We need Elon Musk to pump it on Twitter. :)
Ryan Cohen walking into GameStop like
Hold & buy friends. Let's end today strong
This will end at 30$
"You pumpers know what the word INSOLVENT means? Please define. You know GME is about to go insolvent in just months, right?"
"Sell your #GME while you can and diversify your portfolio in #NAKD !! #AMC #GME , NAKD has low float! Cash in the bank! E commerce launch!! Look at victoria secret shares @$40 each. ffs no brainer!!!"
GameStop game is over as most Reddit bailed from this stock instead of holding and moved to other small cap. Holding at this point won’t make sense at all if you’re trying to justify by company performance or valuation
This is been crazy impressive by the GME crew. But if short interest is now 35%-ish (per two different published sources easily found) it seems like the rocket fuel is substantially gone. I don't understand the absolute conviction when the data supporting the thesis of the trade has changed significantly? Again congrats to those that made big bank.
Here's the GOOD NEWS! It at least can't go down -$116.00 tomarrow lols. Bwaaahaha!

How many puts expire worthless today is the question????????!
I believe this will pop market close. Put Options will expire and be forced to buy back.
How do you guys know that the people who infuse some money into these hedge funds didn’t say to themselves I’ll get my money back because I’m gonna short it when it goes to 350 because there’s no way this is going to stay this high. Money money money￼
"That's $1,400 more we can each put into GameStop. Let's pull together as a team."

Now ROBINHOOD can buy $GNUS no limitsCheck the update$AMC $EXPR $GME $NAKD $BB $NOK $SNDL
GME was at 114 this morning. Will get over this again easily today or tomorrow. Feelin much better where this is going.
Make your money back from GME & $AMC losses in $XLE $OXY $ET & $GEL. It’s like buying banks in 2009. You’ll make huge profits.
Many here Elon Musk not responsible for loss. I take decision.Totally agree.But we have to alert other who keep following Elon Musk. We know establish out there who will pump and dump if they choose and make look Elon Musk tweet is very effective. But don't listen this next time. He has no gut to backup his own tweet.
"Ya know what's sad is that I came on this board when it was 350 and said protect ur profit. ..sell a covered call,buy a put or short against the box....its that fing simple,u cannot loose.................."
Nobody feels sorry for gamblers who bought stock they KNEW was way overvalued.I how a least a few of the Reddit lemmings learned something from their losses.
cmon we got to hit 120 $ it will go like a rocket to 200
Bag holders where you at
BUY MOREEEE
"Big shorts panicked at the morning squeeze so a call was made to the ""powers that be"" ... trading was halted numerous times as first aid. They will nor sleep well this weekend."
Hedge fund wives are leaving for gamestop owners lmao
28 dollar price target by Friday. Shorts already left... there is no juice to squeeze. Move on
"Individual traders like us have our right to trade EVEN the stock price fall to 0. It’s our freedom and choice, our basic rights if you agree with free market."
Can’t wait to pass my valuable GME stock down to my grandkids
I have never seen so many new traders in one space. The logic is interesting just hold and be patient. That only makes sense in long term positioning the downside in this stock far exceeds the upside.
went back up 100% and they halt it lol!!!
Halted?
"I just got an email telling me to post bearish comments here, 20 cents for each post. that explains most of this comment section."
"Now that many Robinhood traders have switched to other brokers and able to trade more than one share, GME is moving up again."
still shorted 121%
"Listen kids, Wallstreetbets scammed you, the ones who pumped GME early on became rich, sold their shares at $450 and have long left leaving you to hold the bag. They're no better than the greedy hedge funds you hate."
"I'm ordering my 4 shares of GME paper stock from my broker, will frame them in a red, overlayed with black, matte border, embossed with gold lettering ""WallStreetBets"" on top, and January 2021 on bottom. I'll keep one for myself, and give away 3 to my friends as a gift. On back will be ""1 of 4...2 of 4 etc., with my initials. I don't even know if you can get paper stock anymore. Used to be $50 - $80 service from your broker, but many companies don't offer paper anymore. Will be fun to check out, though. I have no intention of selling them. It's a novelty thing ;)"
Set limit order high above market value!
Buy and HOLD
Ever wonder when its Tesla's turn??
Where are the shorts spamming every 5 seconds? Good luck to all holding what ever position you are wish you all the luck in the world!
This is unbelievable guys
"No Matter Where You Go !I Will Buy You, My GiMME !!"
"The worst part about this folks is all those trading companies that allowed the margin to be moved this morning are going to have multiple bankruptcy declarations by the margin holders, this means we could see a major upset for the stock market as a whole as trading may stop across the board while SEC regulations are mandated, this could be the first major crisis the stock market has seen since 2008, and that is all because of the hedge funds that wanted to Short today using margin that they did not have."
"its fun watching all you alleged great traders lose your money.your short squeeze is over all the HF covered , bought options and then shorted again while it was up at $350. they've already made billions on you. how many bag holders are left out there? raise your hands"
next stop 70 then 40 then 20 make your choices as to when you want out I know what Id pick
Something shady is going on on Wall Street
Would be a nice feeling seeing sub 10 tmr :))))
I don’t relish in peoples pain but what metrics or rumors or news would cause people to buy a sinking ship @ $300 or more per share. It doesn’t make sense. But I have felt stock market pain and probably will in the future. Just don’t put all your eggs in one basket and you will minimize the pain.
"Tomorrow is our day, hold folks. "
Starting tomorrow no more short ladder attacks .
Do you guys find it ironic that your now talking to yourselves after we watched bots talk to themselves forever 
It seems that there is a max pain at 150 dollar per share http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME

Halted once again
Question is...are we strong or not? Either we stand or not!I
"volume so low, 26M...."

I will order my physical stock certificates from my broker. That way I can show proof on my resume that I have diamond hands.
KEEP BUYING>>>IT IS MOVING!
Great job to all the bulls blocking out the noise and holding. Your persistence will be rewarded
"Let's face it. Still 65 million shares are shorted. Tomorrow, GME will easily take out today's high before noon."
A lot of new traders are probably now thanking Robinhood from preventing them from buying at 400...... be mad all u want but they saved a lot of people from losing a lot of money the reality is this thing tank after that almost like their advanced technical analysis predicted this perhaps this is why the clearing house spiked the margin rates was because they predicted this also and acted in the best interest to protect the market... everyone has their theories.. but after seeing what occurred I can't possibly be upset with them protecting investors from losing 300% of their money
"WANNA SEE A COOL TRICK?Flip.todays GME chart upside, it's amazing how it still a loss no mater how you turn it."
"No more fear in holding over night. It's a different game from yesterday. 65 million shorts will be closing last 30 minutes into the closing. Gap up tomorrow, of course."
GameStop is down 41.91% to 53.68
So how are you guys doing today?

"Your barstool leader lost $700K in this and other stocks and reportedly is blaming Robinhood for allowing him to buy the risky securities. “Portnoy tweeted on Tuesday that he has officially sold all of the stocks he purchased and admonished trading platform Robinhood and its CEO, Vlad Tenev, for allowing users to buy in on the volatile stocks in the first place.”-from yahoo news...not me."
can we take a legal action against GME?
This boards busier at 12:30am then most of the boards are in the middle of the day! More entertaining too

"I heard of a guy who made $200k starting with only $500. Congrats to him, but remember that for any one guy like him, there are thousands of ppl that have loss more than they can afford to. In this pump and dump game, there is no wealth creation. Only transfer of wealth from someone to someone else. Sorry for those who loss..."
I believe when investigations are done a lot of people are going to get their money back to them during these lawsuits plus more this is going to still change the way things are traded and these hedge funders a few of them would probably end up in jail including the CEO of Robin Hood
so all you bears out there must be buying puts if you're so confident it's going back to single digits.
"Most of the time you either sell too early or too late. All these ""diamond hands"" are now learning that selling too early is usually better than selling too late. GME isn't going to repeat quite the same for awhile, because just like the shorts are going to be cautious, the longs are not going to hold as tight next time either."
I don't know whether to long or short.
I lost everything  never investing in stocks again
"Google ""volkswagen 2008 short squeeze"", that's gonna happen to GME, very similar pattern/circumstances."
Didn't have a horse in this race... but it sure was fun to watch.
At this point if ur buying u deserve 2 lose ur money

Buy GME and AMC. Easy up
I am down but still holding all. Hard to double down on my 200 shares but I think I must soon. GME 2020 gross sales show $6.47 Billion with a Market CAP at $7.6 Billion. This is NOT overvalued at this moment.

"Those who think $AMC is dead really need to educate themselves.$AMC doubters & naysayers, dislike this all you want, this week could be big, especially come Friday.This stock will short squeeze, soon, not to the heights of $GME, but it's not unrealistic to expect $80 - it's possible.Hold your shares and buy the dips. the hedges are running out of options."

The gamma squeeze is here!!!!
Sorry to say but... Are you all longs this delusional? How can it be? Haven't you studied math? How can you misunderstand so many basics about investment? You watched to many superhero movies and read too little. Open your eyes and come back to investing when childhood is over.

Im sick of the world were moving in and how little respect we get."

I just really like the stock
"Reuters) - The number of GameStop shares shorted edged higher as the video game retailer's stock price tumbled on Tuesday, according to the latest data from analytics firm S3 Partners.The number of shares shorted was 26.39 million on Tuesday, up from 26.09 million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop's short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $2.38 billion, according to S3.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf)"
macys is excessively shorted how about you guys move there? ps ratio is about a third. gamestop is over 1 for ps ratio. macys is also going to make money when pandemic is over. thoughts fellas? i know you all hate fundamentals for some reason and preach “eating paint chips for breakfast” but come on the low ps stocks need rescuing not companies like koss or gamestop.
$17 to $22 tomorrow.
p.s: Can you have a double gamma squeeze and a return to original value before the actual squeeze? Absolutely yes. Look at what happened to Washington Mutual in 2008. Not all squeezes have to look exactly like the VW chart.
This reminds me of driving a new car off the lot! Buy it in morning before you drive it off the lost price as fallen o it retail . CNBC big advertisement channel
"all the smart wsb members couldn't figure this out...they complain that all the money is concentrated among the big players and the system is rigged, so they get into a money war with them within the rigged system... very smart.sorry for all those who got scammed into giving money back to the man."
Why are people here laughing because the price falls. I mean we are here with you. Guess you find it satisfying that the hedge funds are winning ground.
"I’m holding shares in GME , BB And AMC ....my question is , do we have better chance in AMC better to fly and beat wall street .or BB is the best option now ...I’m holding in the three shares whatever happen"

"I'm not selling, even a single share. Ryan Cohen is transforming Gamestop. I can wait years! I'm waiting on the moon. Yesterday GME hired three top talents from Amazon and Chewy, I've plenty of time to see this story unfold and I'll do it while being a shareholder and probably buying more when I spot a compelling price point, which I'm already spotting nonetheless. How Gamestop can be valued just $5bn with annual revenues to top $9 bn in 2020 (with e-commerce now 25% of sales growing 300%) is simply a mistery. I'm drinking my the and relaxing, guess it will be an unbeliveable story, short squeeze or not. I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice"
So are people buying solely for the purpose of hoping for a short squeeze again and then dumping? I looked at their earnings and it's not great. Tell me there's more to it than just this pump to dump. My friend was right. I should have called him before I bought this morning. Now like other bag holders I'm simply waiting for the price to go up so I can dump on other new traders.
Keep holding???? I am holding Puts and this is going down even faster than I thought.
Lets get it to $150 today!!
love the dip. adding tomorrow when funds clear.
You can still sell now and buy $XLE $OXY $ET and $GEL. You will recover some of your losses. Why hold onto a stock for emotional attachment? You are GOING to lose your money.Buy something that’s trading too low. You will triple your money in a year.
"The best way to recover is to buy Hexo/Truss-Molson they are aligned- If you looking for good $$$ go and buy Hexo-Cannabis-based products are popping up everywhere these days.Neiman Marcus, Sephora, Vitamin Shoppe, Kroger, Barney’s DSW, Sephora, CVS, American Eagle, Walgreen’s, Wegman’s are just a few. Couple that with changing consumer attitudes, and the CB boom only gets stronger. “Americans are more likely now than at any point in the past five decades to support the legalization of MJ in the U.S. The 68% of U.S. adults who currently back the measure is not statistically different from last year's 66%; however, it is nominally Gallup's highest reading, exceeding the 64% to 66% range seen from 2017 to 2019.” over 50 billions soon"
So the party is over. That was fun. Where’s the next house party?
"I’ve seen pump and dumps many many times. This thing will have a resurgence off $50 in my opinion. It will dead cat in shorts that are perfectly happy with $70-$300 point moves. Once those shorts cover, new longs like myself jump in for the bounce then the more stubborn shorts cover and there ya have it. It won’t sustain the price it jumps to but I can see $50 being the bottom for awhile. You have to be a very patient short ti watch this go up $30-$50 just to get another $10 drop from here all said and done."

For all GME bulls.....at the end of the day this what matters!!!!The price to earnings ratio (PE Ratio) is the measure of the share price relative to the annual net income earned by the firm per share. PE ratio shows current investor demand for a company share. A high PE ratio generally indicates increased demand because investors anticipate earnings growth in the future.

I heard they was different spike of price last night on AMC and GME DONT GIVE UP could be them to recover
Nothing is worse than a short IMHO. They are Debbie downers.
Was anyone else bursting out laughing when CNBC kept having Gamestop in their background of their studio on the little virtual screen with like 300 dollar price tags I thought that was hilarious
gap up tomorrow
I sorta feel bad for the first time investors that lost it all.. this a terrible way to enter the market on a pump n dump
nakd on the rise buy on the dip and recover some lost funds!
It would be interesting to hear from a Robinhood investor who was restricted to 1 share at $400+; averaging down at $90?

Now it shows a decent gain of $5,000 within a week. I can call this high risk award. I am tempted to sell another call but I am not sure if there still be some short squeeze coming. Anyone will go long at this price?"
I am holding 100 shares but seems like $AMC has a more realistic price and has a good outlook and can possibly double longterm

"Well. I had no part of this and wouldn’t touch this with a 100ft pole. But I think the SEC should really investigate Elon Musk. I heard he shut down his twitter account. Hmmmm he claims he is focusing on his new projects. Idk sounds too coincidental to me. But don’t worry Elon, if the SEC want to see your info they can and will. Go get em’ guys."

still think that this is $100 stock???
"To all the Redit stick it to the man participants, that is no reason to bid up these stocks. You are only making The Man richer. Case in point. On Thursday Silver Lake Partners owned $600 million of risky convertible debt in AMC. The stock price surge triggered a right to convert the debt at $13.51 which they promptly sold for an inflated $16.05 netting a cool $113 million. Don’t kid to ourself. Institutions and insiders who owned most of game stock pre event have been dumping, selling to the Reddit crowd at inflated prices resulting in a massive transfer of wealth from the retail investors ( the little guy) to the institutions ( The Man)."

"There is no squeeze. New positions were opened You see the one thing hedges know that you don’t is the company is hemorrhaging. No bank will support any model for sales of buggy whips, more or less game cartridges. Short term sale. Longer term chapter 7"

"If you had been a previous owner of GME stock, then went on vacation two weeks ago, you would be thinking 'hey my GME stock did pretty good while I was away'!"
Sideways market with extreme sell pressure that's their plan for the day if you wanted to buy now is the time I'm not a financial advisor just a smart person with common sense
"SLS seriously another 204,391 reg sho fail to deliver violations for the first half of January on top of the 1.2 million from December... Keep in mind this has a higher naked short percentage than $AMC and $GME ... this is nuts for a low 11.4 million float."
Hope this up 300% today.
"Thanks for all your company this evening guys, wishing everyone a safe and enjoyable weekend best regards everyone"
"Quote from the latest S3 article:If long shareholders begin to sell their positions, expect short sellers to jump in and help GME’s stock slide continue. But if long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new buying opportunity, we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short squeeze."
"All those shares changing hands in a tight range. My, my, how did that happen?"

Sorry to say some here are learning a valuable lesson. If you don't know how the game is played better to sit on the sideline and watch or you get crushed. Some made a lot of money some lost a lot and it wasn't just the hedgies. Thats the problem with these games.

"Yellin, the problem was not reddit. The problem was Robin Hood by part.“You have four competing claims on the regulatory process. One is the protection of the small investors. Two, you have a question of, is Reddit some sort of collusion, some sort of market manipulation? Three, we have questions about the intermediary and hedge funds. Was there collusion there? And four, you have a question of investment suitability.”"

Gary Busy rang the bell on GME 4 days ago
"made 1,000 off of unexperienced AMC buyers yesterday... there was a mass buy at exactly 1 p.m so I saw this and bought In at 12:25 and sold at 1:10 for like an extra dollar per shares lol"
I’m sorry guys I didn’t hold .I BOUGHT MORE! 
"Also, to everyone who says ""If he holds, I hold!"" in reference to DFV. He had $6 million worth of calls expire on Jan 15. The stock could goto 0 tomorrow and he'd still have $6 million. How much would you have??"
buy time
This is the time to Buy more! going to 100 dollars!

I have an uncle who’s best friend said GME is going to $300 by Friday
Guys it’s over .. the GME hype has vanished ! This isn’t a real long term investment. GameStop won’t be around much longer. On a side note ... I hope this touches under 10 tmr:)
"Mark Cuban says ""if you can afford to hold....you hold"". Of course you can afford to hold A.) you bought shares on a platform that you can trade for free B.) you used money that you got from the government i.e. taxpayers/people that work and C.) you live in your mom and dad's basement. I would say yes you can afford to hold; what have you got to lose?"
I told you all the billionaires would cover in pre-market. Look. LOOK hold your shares. Let’s make them pay a premium.
Welcome to the high rollers table folks place your bets for next week
"yep, I bought AAPL after hour. It's popping2%. AAPL didn't pop at earnings, but this time earnings breakout will happen. Classic from smart money to wipe out retailers. Buy AAPL and AMZN..AMZN same pattern. AMZN earnings was huge but price is down. Classic and new rally is coming for AMZN as well. GME ..hold hold."
This is a play on other investors' actions and nothing more.If there was a hint of fundamental value it would help....but there isn't.Don't stay too long at the punch bowl
"Everyone here who is complaining about the price per share is really showing their ignorance about what they know of investing in stocks. First of all...do any of you understand how naked short selling works, who does it, and how it creates the appearance of more shares that are actually issued? You all seen how $GME had a 140% short interest on the stock right? Where do you think it came from? Yes naked short sale's by the hedge funds and large market makers. Until you understand how this works you will forever be wondering why a stock fails to gain forward movement. Silver and mining stocks are and have been extremely manipulated and can easily be targeted to mess with the price per share. The DTCC is a privately held company that is owned by the prime brokers, and they clear, transact, and hold most of the stock in this country. They clear over a billion stock transactions per day. They are owned by Goldman, Merrill, Citigroup, JP Morgan, ect. They work ""uncontrolled"" when it comes to naked short selling. If you place a stop limit order, they know about it, and they will come take it from you. They control the direction a stock will go. You boys better start doing your homework if you want to understand why GPL is not moving the way you think it should."
why is it that when price drops...no halts but when we see gains we will see halt after halt
I find it exceptionally comical that those who lost the most are doubling down. The hedge funds I couldn't care less for them but the little retail investors it's time to wake up. The company is a dog because they didn't keep up with a changing business world and WSB's can't fix that.

Almost Every person that shorted now will be a share holder crazy how that works
GME aid package in the works. They have to get Manchin on board.
"Premarket is looking good today, especially with #AMC and #GME on the SSR. They’ll be hitting us with ladder attacks first thing 8:30. I’ll be holding."
"I don’t own GME. And If you don’t like GME, posting comments here is a waste of time. Aren’t there any other stocks for you? And why are you saying all the time that stock will go down?"
"some amateur guys shorted GME and are all over the forums bashing it to go down. it wont go down, people have cost value of over $300 and are holding it no matter what"
at this price it's worth buying long to support Ryan Cohen and the bulk thesis
This is like making love: Slow and steady but aiming to the G-Spot $GME 
"I’m Still holding, volatility is the name of the game haha"
If you are doing this to take down hedge funds..... one hedge fund was up $700M being long GME. Hedge funds are limited to only shorting.
"$69,420 is happening"
"With a price target of infinity during the squeeze, this is really good value."
Get it back to 200 today guys 
"I read that if you put in a high limit sell order, it prevents shares from being borrowed by shorts. May even forces them to be returned. I bet this gets taken down."
SHORTIES will be squeezed $AEO same as $GME $AMC
I can’t believe how many negative posts one after another. Hedge funds worried this thing will shoot back to $400 otherwise their wouldn’t be so much negative noise!!!
You guys have got it all wrong we should be buying short orders now recycling the money
according to the wolf of wall street... Robinhood is toast.
"If you woke up to quadruple-digit gains on GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock, you're probably living every investor's fantasy. Shares of the video game retailer have surged more than 1,500% since the beginning of the year, driven by coordinated buying efforts of traders on popular social media sites such as Reddit. Been watching stocks like this. Found a service that tells me buys and sells. https://daytradingsquad.team/TTG-Instant-Access"

"Do you sense it yet? It started out a sprint, now it's a marathon. Guerrilla warfare, with price increases/decreases $5-$10. Occasionally you'll see bigger ups and downs, sure, but it's a street fight."
"I just bought GME at 96.71 pullback. Also bought AMZN at 3394.90 pullback and AAPL at 134.79...these 3 will pop today. SHORT SQUEEZE CONTINUES. AMAZON revenues/EPS should calm GME investors. GME to 150, AMZN squeeze has to start soon 3500 breakout is coming"
"Most of us have suffered $GME losses. Most of us are gambling with discretionary money. You sell now, it's a guaranteed loss. Why not hold onto a possibility? Honestly, ask yourself, what's the worse that'll happen? If you can live with the worse case scenario then hold. If that worse case scenario causes too much anxiety or tips your risk scale, then sell. Do what is best for you and your sanity. Find your bottom line. That line that you're not going to cross because it sucks on the other side. Don't be swayed by the jabber of anonymous opinions. Keep your focus on you & your bottom line.Be good to yourself when investing. No one else will."
if my comment reach 100 dislike i get half share at 30$
$100-$200 next weekI hope you loaded up shares todayAll the best to everyone!
GME board hired Amazon's former head of engineering for web services. They'll change their biz model from brick/mortar to online streaming and should be good in the future.
We need to see lower numbers so the real squeeze can begin
Learn from this... Never chase or give in to the hype. Don’t buy because your friend who just started investing told you to buy... You will have better luck throwing your money at a SPAC that is trading around $10.
I have watched many growth stocks over decades like Cmcsa comcast with lots of debt become a gigantic value company. Reminds me of were GameStop is today.
remember how you need to buy a real share to close... how long can they sell the same 100k shares between themselves till they need to really cover
"The amount of shills and bots speaks for itself, the hedgefunds are desperate. GME is still shorted way above 100%, no amount of post/pre-market manipulation or short-ladder-attack will change that. The squeeze will come, were seeing the same patterns as Volkswagen 2008 (Google it). See you at $1000 "
"All signs indicate a merger is coming, Some massive purchases went down. If no merger, one or both would have publicly come out to deny. If not, it is bad for Lucid brand. Some scared money are now trying to push it down to jump in. Saudis love opulence, and like nothing more than this sky rocketing prior to merger. The want way more hype than NIO and XPEV which are still decent companies. They are chasing TSLA. Superbowl is lined up for a Lucid big money commercial. If this goes down, hold shares and buy more, it just means it's going to pop. This is not a $GME gamble, worst case scenario the deal falls thru, and it drops. CCIV is a massive blank cheq company, and they will pounce on the next big thing. New investors, if you can't afford tonplay this long, sit out and wait for the merger at a higher price. For the rest with gravy money, double down, and enjoy the ride. Not financial advice! GLTA"

Power to the people! $gme $amc
"I was supposed to short it when it hit $400... correct? should I sell yet, or wait till it goes to $20?"
"So ultimately, the hedge funds had to cheat to stop this rally by closing down the trading houses and with a full out media blitz. Am I right?"
It make sense to buy GME at this level. AMZN beat earning huge. So I will buy AMZN as well. They sold a lot of games the same as GME. AAPL is hot too. All related to games
People are still transferring brokerages
We started this knowing it was either yacht or foodstamps. Don't paper hands now
"the few who bought before the spike from $20 to whatever hundred are pail in comparison than the majority who fell into the trap and bought above $200. Don't want to rub it in, but you were warned multiple times! Off to the slaughter house you go! Not too late to cut your loss. This WILL GO BELOW $10 imminently"
HALT AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO $100 IN 5 MINUTES
To be honest，do you think this will be green or red today？
This feels like silence before the storm at 2:00p.m. EST Friday. What will unfold in the next two hours will be interesting.

"I guess the new method of trading is buy high, sell low, then sell lower."
"They didn't believe in COVID getting a second wave, who are we to doubt $GME's resurrection?HOLD"
Why do you think RH hasnt lifted restrictions on GME? Hold you stocks!
"Even if $SPCE dropped 90%, you’d still make 10,000% eventually if you held long enough. On the other hand, $GME and $AMC are in dying industries and are probably destined to go to ZERO."
"The higher the price the more hedge funds lose, lets get this thing to $150 with diamond hands. The people cannot be stopped nor manipulated!"
New bag holders that bought in today. Do you really want to hold over the weekend?
I will hold yesterday i boughy 300 shares at 92$ and will buy 1000 shres today let the hedgefunders cry all their will be ruined of price manipulation if we don't sell then they have to buy our shares at the end ao the moral of the atory just hold and Hold
Here is the 1st halt of the day
whyyyy is this not moving i bought 250 stocks at 229$
"I do believe RH halted trading of this in order to let hedge funds cover their short positions at a lower price again. It is very and clearly obvious. They just hide behind things like “oh we need to maintain liquidity and adhere to financial obligations”.Good bye, Vlad. Hope your IPO goes wildly terrible."
"So if you guys are so strong and GME is so good, why is it just falling then? LOL"
"IMO story over for this. Everyone lost, except big hedge funds. It's not good. They forced everyone average Joe to sell."
Bots out in full force today lol. But whatever yahoo finance legit is basically a grain of sand compared to Reddit. Kinda feel bad for the people who pay these bots to go on here to try and scare paper hands.

Why are you buying gme ? Answer this pls
"Guys.. You can literally buy games anywhere else!!! You can purchase and download it on your console!!! Like this is blockbuster all over again... Game stop in my opinion is a horrible company not just because it is archaic but because of the service.. They are the retail game pawn shop.. How many of you have traded in your games?? Have you gotten back the value of the game when you traded it in?? To be completely honest i hope every one wins on this.. I hope those of you that got in early were able to take profit and run, those of you putting in put options and waiting I hope you win too.. But the irrefutable truth is, game stop is a bad company.. Numbers and general customer interaction proves this."
Want a clue????.....Look at the 1 month chart!
Sell GME buy WKHSBeen saying this on this board for 10 days.If you pulled trigger then you have have about 8 shares WKHS for each GME soldThis morning about 1.5Next week maybe half a share of WKHS can be bought with proceeds of each GME soldSell GME while you can get anything for it.

Game over rotate into another stock. No more juice in this squeeze

RH cancelled my sell again once they seen the stock going up. LMFAO 
"It breaks my heart to see this. You really stuck it to the shorts for a while. You're just too bull-headed to let go. We could do it again with something else. Some of you have learned your lessen so next time when it starts to crater get out. 500% is great! More is better but don't give it all back, know when to get out. We need unity and some fresh meat! I say biotechs. VBIV, INO or if someone knows something better lets hear it."

"New to this investing. QuestionI bought (2nd stock ever) GME 50 @ 5.25 and sold at $422.33, due to being amazed of profits. Should I buy back in while it's dropping or wait a few more days?"
"this is not advice, do what you will, but this is a movement not a bet anymore. watch the film ""capitol"" and it will be apparent of why this is impotant. I will keep 1k in gamestop because I want to be able to say I participated. they are for sale for 1k a share. if the squeeze is squeeze I dont care I will hold for a decade as will most everyone else. on the bright side if it goes south they may be the new netflix for games . love this stock!"
"Everyone would be thinking, Finalyy calls are so cheap. I can finally buy some"
"Here we go again, they are limiting, well guess what we ain’t selling !!!!"
Is it as of today RH are allowing you to buy 100 shares? Or has that been the case for a few days?
"Think about this my warriors friends.I'm so amused to see ""the thumb down"" on a positive post. Remember a thumb down on positive post it's either:1- a Shorter that is freaking out.2- an average trader with no guts. (then you should not buy if you can't HOLD, you are not helping the cause)3- a disguised hedge-funder trying to insert fear so he can recover his short.What kind of person are you?$AMC, $GME, $NOK, $NAKD, $KOS, $BB, $BBBY, $TIGR, $FUTU"
$70 was last week Monday's price. Then it went to $145 Tuesday. Then doubled again that Wednesday and that's when RobinHood shut it Thursday 3am.

This is going to see 20s today

I like how it's trading afterhours +++
"As I predicted, this one is going to $40. Probably lower after the dust settles. Again, people should protest against shorting a stock. Why just put people who commit fraud into jail rather than punishing retai investors. Guess it's hard as so many people do bad things in Wall Street."
Thanks god I sold
Here you have it boys: this is another super clear example that the system is rigged.
"I’m in, let’s ride tomorrow!"

Welcome to the real world kids. Never buy a stock because some green haired broke Antifa kid in a chatroom told you to. the same kid who hates the market and hedge fund managers and owns 0 stocks
I heard that the shorts have to pay 23% interest for borrowing stocks. how is the 23% calculated? is it 23% from the current stock price or is it when they bought them?

"I muted 750 shorties today on this board. Now, nobody is talking to me. Lol"
When the ￼ short squeeze they were expecting arrives
shorts manipulate 6 million shares and their number is getting smaller.
"Gamestop seems to be a big retailer, but in the end, retail investors can't escape the fate of being cheated by big players and being cut off leeks.Robinhood, a hedge fund and stock trading platform, is his own. Citadel was backed by Melvin Capital, and retail investors’ short squeeze did not succeed. GameStop has fallen sharply these days, and retail investors were cut leek. Any bubble has to be seen when it will be burst. Citedal and Ronbinhood can see all the cards of the retail investors, and the retail investors are drunk even after being taken advantage of and helping others count the money.Melvin is the guise of Citadel, cheating retail investors to chase high, Robinhood is also the guise of Citadel, using free transactions to defraud all the information of retail investors, Citadel takes advantage of the high position to fill short positions, the retail investors are all done!"
"this 20% gain is possible with small buys from tiny accounts, look at the volume, it takes one shark to buy a large amount of shares and this will explode and believe me sharks are always swimming around nked shorts."
"Expecting a post lunch attack till about 1:30. Then we rise some until close. We won't close green, but we'll close higher than here."
I love cheap shares !

"Of all the recent meme stock plays, the only one that will actually soon trade higher than it traded last week is $BB.All the panic $GME, $AMC, $KOSS; etc. sellers who lost big on those stocks are going to feel really bad when they realize they missed out on buying this week's drop in BB.BB will soon enough be trading at $50, while the other stocks mentioned here will NEVER again see last week's highs."
In s couple hours gme will jump over the moving average. This is a very bullish buy right now. Price will rise to the 160 to 225 range by tomorrow and Friday.
"The new appointed head of SEC Gary Gensler, should make drastic changes in the manipulated illegal actions that hedge funds, brokerages, and DTC do in the markets. This is a playground for the rich. I won't believe that retail investors have a chance until things change."
"despite what the media says - this is far from over a lot of money will be made on the retail side. GME is at $90 , as long as people hold and not sell. the hedge funds are attempting to drive the stock down to cover there shorts.....120% , they borrowed more than 100% of the shares and need to drive the price down."
I bought GME at 325. It was going to go to $1000. But ....I still am Holding the stock
"They're not allowing retail traders to buy freely and now are conducting short ladder attacks thinking they can phase us. Up to you you can choose to paper hand and fall into the hands of HF manipulation or you can hold and trust the fact that they have to cover at some point. When these people start using bots to get you to sell, you should know that they are doing this out of desperation. They pay huge interest everyday they don't cover. Take a walk and take a break. Relax, this is stock movement is artificial and would be a completely different story if there were no trading restrictions."
Round 2 spike will be 10x round 1. Patience will be rewarded. Buy and/or hold.
this stock is a buy at 18. Take out all the risk. you buy now and 18 will eventually come
lets squeeze...bought my one share
"I would do technical analysis and show you the mathematical facts and financial data behind this stock's decline, but let's be honest.... Most of you don't care. You're just in search of the next FOMO. That's why there's not about a lot of serious posters on these forums. That's why so many people lose their lunch money."
When they realize stocks don’t only go up
"To those complaining about the shorts manipulating GME, are you against manipulating a stock for financial gain? When did that start being bad, when they did it to you? It was fine when you did it to them!"
Looking for excuses to tell the wife how I lost everything. Help please !!!!!!
This goes down as a historic event. As kids put it: YOLO!And these same kids will be telling their kids in 20 years: I told you so.Life goes on.
The squeeze is still on for other stocks since it is easy money. There are back room discussions and they will make their move. They will be careful and discreet and have a value in their financial analyst so that SEC or others can't indict them.
bought 5 shares at 350.
will see below S10.00 next week?
"Trend to close sub $80. My prediction is last 10 min rapid decline, plus 20%+ down in after hours."
The insane part about daytrading GME is being up 90%+ when you bought in the dip and sold at the bounce.
Even number and percentage again
Of course this will go above $100 tomorrow.
"I advise anyone who still wants to get onto the rocket to get in now, FOMO buyers will make the price hike as soon as pre-market hits come Monday. Don't miss out while the price is still not that high"
CNBC says real value is only $30 tonight.
"Everyone keep holding, all the bag holders will know once the squeeze happens"
"This message board is hilarious. We are all retail investors I assume, who at one time or another have been burned by short sellers and their manipulative practices. Some people tried to take advantage of a naked short hedge fund, for once, and now everyone is dancing on their graves celebrating....hedge funds winning again? Why so angry at WSB, they saw a shot, took it, and were wrong? Haven’t we all been crushed by the market at one point or another? Keep being happy that billionaires get richer in a broker system I guess."
"#NAKD When a company's short interest is high (above 40%), it frequently means a large portion of investors anticipate the shares will go down in value and are looking to profit from the decline or are using the short as a hedge against a possible decline. #NAKD Has less than 30% !! #amc #gme"
"the HEGE fund win again and ROBINHODDERS loose we all LAUGH becuase they all THINK they can change REALTY but the MARKET and PROS prove otherwise as you SAW LAST WEEK ROBINHOD and the DIVINE SEC with HEGE FUND stopped people FROM BUYING!WE will control again NEXT WEEEK there WON""T BE A short squeeze just LONGS loosing there MONEY!GOD BLESS$NIO $LI $XPEV $AMC $NAKD $BB $NOK"
Ain't been in a Gamestop store in 5 years or better.
GME short interest 70%
I think the longs can make 100% on this stock easy. But only after it drops to $1.
"I’m a 5 year vet in the stock market and even I got sucked into this. My experience was promising I wasn’t gonna do it, then nibbling, and making good trades. All of a sudden I’m up 2k. Maybe I’m ok at trading right? Then traded today and lost all of my trading gains and then some. So down about 1k. Now I’m really done. I would guess 2.5% win big, 15% win, 25% are more or less the same, 37.5% lose, and 10% lose big. Quite literally gambling and just a big shuffling around of money is all that happened"
My condolences to those of you who bought at or near the top of this 21st century tulip mania stock. As a reminder to never follow the lemmings over the cliff again have GME tattooed on your forearm in bold black letters along with (Glorious Money Enema) directly underneath in blue.
Let's start buying back the stock.. One share at a time

Reddit People.. you may have to lose money to understand the value of money but if you're smart.. you don't gamble on Bubble Stocks to begin with.
Who bought $50 and below puts that are going to expire worthless today only helping hedge funds bank a premium cause most retail couldn’t afford them in the money all week

Hedge Funds to diamond hands
It’s only just beginning
you should really consider selling this if you know what's good for you
The tendies await
"Finally! Articles about hedge funds who made a fortune by buying Gamestop, like Mudrick, Senvest, Must Asset, etc. ETFS made a fortune (many have to rebalance quarterly ... so more sales coming), mutual funds made a fortune (actively managed so they have probably sold out - like hedge funds and RIAs)."
"If volume picks up tomorrow and this thing takes off, it will start a domino effect. Not even kidding around."
From tomorrow they are not allowed anymore to short the stock! This is good news for us bulls!

So basically what I’m getting from these diamond hand folks ... wsb is a cult ?
The sales of video game consoles is dropping in tandem with share price of GME. Weird...
Pay back time
One of the best quotes I read yesterday on this board (not sure if its originally his/ somebody else’s) which made me smile this weekend morning after all the emotional rollercoaster last week with gme: “I can manipulate the market; every time I buy - the stock goes red!”. Reminds me to smile and have fun along the way irrespective of the situation. Thanks bro! 
BUY MORE AND HOLDDD
100 by the end of the day. 300 back again
there are always bagholders - and it's rarely the big boys. there are always pops in a downward trend to give you false hope - that's just part of the game. cut your losses - this ship has sailed.
Boom!
"Remember, HOLD. This can go up to the price we want! Stop going for the small profits, we can make this go back up, and I mean really up!"
"for everyone who doesn't understand whats happenning to the price... you're seeing whats called a high frequency trade between two parties holding a significant amount of shares. these individuals can trade amonst each other for lower prices each trade in order to drive down the market price for that share. these computers dont pick up the amount of individual shares were involved in the total of the trades, it counts every share sale as a different share, so what youre seeing is the same 300k or so shares being traded over and over again causing people to panic sell for those prices. thats why its important to hold the line during these price drops. its not permanent and will cause a spike if everyone refuses to let go of their positions. this is not financial advice i just like the stock and how it works!!!"
BUY MORE AND WAITING MONDAY PREMARKET
LETS BUY TOGETHER!!!!
"guys. please. LISTEN.When the short interest reports hit the 9th of february, this is going to be a bloodbath. Hedge funds and millionnaires alreqdy covered or banked their profits. You're fighting against yourself. this is going straight down to 30/40."
Still holding and haven't lost a dime yet!!!
"Hey, sorry guys. Just got back from changing my diaper out. We still panic selling?"
Over 600 profit from my 68 put expiring tomorrow’!!!

And, I answer to a Higher authority..... NEVERTHE LESS... We need to CRUSH them so.... HOLD HOLD HOLD... And buy a little more in the dips.... DO NOT SELL!!! It will be okay, friends..."
Hedgefunds can't bring it below 90 they bought those shares to cause the dip in hopes to scare investora
"BIG players wanted in, maybe this dip is a buying opportunity?"
About a week ago when the price was 300$ I warned that this will get back to 40$ in a week. There were lot of thumbs down. Well we are getting there folks.Good luck to you all.
Smart people got off the Titanic before it went down.
This is fun
"I think Robinhood already know it is over. They are going to be sued and may shut the business. Maybe Citadel asked them to stop accepting buy orders at all cost, even if it gets sued and fined, and has to close business , the cost of it is still smaller than let the bull run kill them all.The fact the government gave a tacit nod to let Robinhood to refuse buy orders is another live example of under broad day light what Nobel Laureates Economist Joseph Stiglitz said, the US government is of the 1%, by the 1% and for the 1%."
Gamestop future is secured. They going to get whole lot more online customer and more store traffic so This price may be buy on fundamental. I will load up by trading volatility.
Hmmmm lands on a real number at the end of trading day. Can’t short ladder...... can’t manipulate days end. Hhhmmmm Interesting McGuire...

Too much pressure to sell Man!!!Why ask us though....Why not just ask hedgies to short ladder
But but but... I thought this stock was going to 20$ today... lollll
I love GME
"@Nick no matter how you look at it, if shorts buy all the free flow share available in the market , they can’t cover , assuming they have to return share at the same time. I am surprise how you can short a company 120% or more . Short is too greedy"
Current longs be aware that recently the stock drops significantly at the end of the day and in the after hours tradingCheck it out
reinforcements are here boys!!!
"You've climbed a big stairway to the rooftop of a building, and you drop a red rubber ball to the pavement below. Does is just hit the ground, or does it bounce up significantly before eventually, it comes to rest on the ground? Of course, it will bounce several times. Over the next several weeks, GME will have numerous bounces, just like the red rubber ball. It likely won't see $400 again, but will give many nimble investors the chance to exit their position, if they're not in it for the long haul. Also, endless opportunities for daytraders. The next period will be a tugowar between Longs and Shorts. Volatility will remain. Good luck to all."
$GERN buy 100......Last week when I first posted here GME was $330 pps......$GERN was $1.72......For 1 share of GME you could have bought 191 shares of $GERN Now 191 shares of $GERN = $4291 share of GME = $106Not to late to join the $GERN express before it hits $3Remember Laz loves you baby !!!! -Laz

It’s better to get out now and have something rather than nothing...at least you can invest in something else

The Blackrock hype - is there a stock that Blackrock doesn't hold?They run index funds and must hold thousands of stocks that constitute the indices.It's not an endorsement of the investment merits of any of the underlying stocks.
$GME $AMCGameStock is dropping huge in Europe right now. They trade a day ahead. Google “GME Frankfurt exchange.” Doesn’t look good.
what happens if gamestop issues more shares?
Possibly the easiest short in market history when a $10 stock is in the $400's!
"Entry Point $2. Lets face it the big boys at the end always win. Happy for those small investors who made a killing, but unfortunate truth is that there are now more retail investors who lose big than the big funds who are making another killing shorting from 400 all the way down to 10."
DON'T WORRY....IT WILL GO BACK TO $500.....................................AFTER 1 FOR 100 REVERSE SPLIT
Annoying how everyone is asking on every single stock that goes up if its a short squeeze or not. This $GME thing going to bring in a LOT of newbie investors that are gonna lose a lot of money thinking they can get rich quick on every single stock. Hope I'm wrong though!
When will this thing hit > $35000?
and this is where the hedge funds are getting out of their short positions and buying shares much cheaper then last week. The article on 39% short.float when the stock was at 400 was purposefully wrong. You think hedge funds closed their positions in the 300-400s or in the 60s today?
"i was gonna accept defeat, closed my eyes and hitting the sell button. Bought 15 more instead."
In a Ponzi scheme you want to be the first one in because you will double your money. The last one in$438 not so lucky. The markets welcome new investors. Welcome! However this time take your time to make good evaluations on what you do with your hard earned money. The NYSE is not a lottery ticket. Good luck in the future.
Hope for You Guys that this will hit very positivé today!!!
"JOKE'S ON THE BAG HOLDERS. WSB may have proved its point, but there will ALWAYS be bag holders when a company is financially unstable. If anyone of you bothered to read the 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings (which I'm sure 99.9% of you didn't bother), you'd see this company is losing money hand over fist and only did OK in 2020 due to the tax benefits of the CARES act. That benefit doesn't apply to 2021, so with $1 BILLION equity (ASSETS - LIABILITIES) being lost PER YEAR (PER YEAR FOLKS), and with the equity down to $322 million as of Oct, 2020, if you love to bag hold, just wait until next month's Annual Loss Report. When equity goes to zero, a company is INSOLVENT. That means bankruptcy."
"Find it very interesting how $BB,$AMC, $GME, $NOK, and $NAKD all have almost identical charts for the day right now."

who's here is now homeless? lol....
"Are people ready yet to file a complaint to the sec? Choose ""Manipulation of a security"" on the form. We have to make our voices known. Do it!"
Where making up some great ground. We only need around a 700% gain from this level. And if you got pumped up about that you deserve to lose your money.
"Oh god it is crashing, how could I have not seen this coming??? What about all the hope, faith, resilience and diamond hands? How could I have been duped, I’ve been trading for 6 months and I know everything."
Going to buy
shorts win.... again
Stay tuned for that 70s show
"kids got their allowance money today, bought more GME"
They (WS) are pumping everything to draw attention out of GME. Right now situation looks like the battle for Stalingrad during WW2.
Jose the bear just increased the target from $110 to $200. He must be a realist 
The sell off should continue tomorrow as no one want to hold this sinking stock over the weekend. Next week could drop down to10.
if any one short here lost home
This poor thing isn’t ever touching 100 ever again. To the ground she goes where it belongs
GME Investors should go look at FNRC. It up over 150% this week and moving higher. Very cheap at .00005 736 Million shares traded today. Looking for another 300% or more. FNRC is the winner today so far.
I don't know what I'm gonna do....I put my wife's entire self directed IRA in to GME at various prices running from about $200/sh up to about $450/sh . I was hoping to surprise her on Valentines Day. Everybody said it was going to $1000/sh. Does anyone think it will come back to at least $400/sh so I will be even.
I AM BUY ONLY 1 SHARE AT 65. IF IT DROP 5$ MORE I WILL BUY ANOTHER 1 SHARE. I WILL KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL IT GOES BELOW 1$
"Be honest guys, if this stays green and ends 80 -85 at close it would be remarkable, they clearly have momentum,"
Last Friday $325 today $65 down 80% for the week
Pls don’t take the bait and buy now
this morning buyers are up 30%. gratz
Do shorts have to cover by the end of the current trading day?
In GME at $75. GL ALL! Lets go!

"Here's the thing. Name one, just one, short squeeze bubble that worked out for anyone buying anywhere but at the bottom of the pyramid. I'm not even gonna wait. Because there is no such example. From Tulips to Japanese real estate to VW to IOM to GME. Unless you buy low and sell higher, the end is brutal. Sooner or later, everything reverts to its fundamental value. I don't have any sympathy for anyone who gets slaughtered here because the above is known. This is not a secret. Many homologous events have preceded this one. And every one of them has ended the same exact way. In pain for those who do not sell. Ignorance is not an excuse."
APES DONT CARE ABOUT VALUATION. HEDGE FUNDS NOT THE BRIGHTEST IN THE ROOM. THIS IS ABOUT EXPOSING YOUR CRIMES OF CREATING FAKE SHARES. THIS IS ABOUT THE EXPOSING YOUR EFFORTS TO STACK THE DECKS. THIS IS ABOUT BROKERAGES FAILING FOR TAKING FEES SEVERAL TIMES FOR LENDING THE SAME SHARES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ITS OVER.

What another great day in the stock market. Another big gain day...unless you are a GME long bagholder....ha ha
Buy now sell at 600. Easy.
In reality they will do a share offering around 20 bucks and it will save the company which should have been the main reason now it's over they can do that
You want another -60% red day?
Where’s the 50$ price target?
Why would the folks who shorted this and got burned last week - short it again at these prices?The short sellers are generally a pretty savvy group.
GAMERS RISE UP!!!
The noose is getting tighter and tighter on the shorts!!!!! Volume is getting lower and lower!!!!! People are holding!!!!!
People who are buying into this learned absolutely nothing from yesterday. This price action is exactly what is expected....draw retailers back in and dump it again. Us veterans are trying to help you out. The company is worth a fraction of where it is now. It will head back down to it's true value. I never had any skin in the GME game but it's so easy to see what is going on.
"'Diamond hands', they said! 'Hold don't sell', they said! 'You'll be rich', they said. 'Gimme the keys to your Honda', the bank said."
I’m selling at either 4.20 or 4200. Either is fine with me
But why would anyone try to mislead us about GME?? I thought the world was a kind place.
"I remember when I started investing at Dean Witter many years ago. I asked a very successful broker how low a stock can go. He laughed and said ""0"""
The bears thought that shorting at these levels is a no brainer and so easy. Making money is never easy. Bulls and bears will fight. Adjust your position size to fit your risk tolerance.
"up 65%. Fess up, who shorted at the open? Or worse yet, bought weekly puts the expire today. lulz"
Funny last week I posted this stock would be the biggest collapse of all time. Yup I was right.
"I think I'll invest in unilever stock. You see unilever makes vasaline petroleum jelly. And given how many of you WSB longs got totally bent over and got roughed up by GME, I'd say you folks will be buying a lot of vaseline to relieve the pain for a long long time. ha ha"

$GME $AMC $KOSS $KODKThese pumpers have reached QAnon status.
"So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gainsthey could salvage and some more clear manipulationregardless of the source. But then what? Well, after thebounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantasticbuying opportunity which made it recover quickly...butthen something interesting started happening. It starteduptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower loWs,higher highs; no sight more beautiful.My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bearsattack. The news has been consistently saying thesqueeze is over but one and at time they are sayingtheir might be a second surge and their reasoning isif retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunityinstead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. Thelogic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goesup, if people are selling, it goes down.So today is pure magic. It doesnt need to be a wildswing up to be promising. What i it needs to be is slow,consistent buying pressure even during restrictedtrading.But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact.All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin saysthey covered. It will be the third time they have claimedthat. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter?No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the $3figures are right that means the guess right now is thatthis stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter thisisn't including newly opened positions which anyone intheir right mind would certainly open a short positionwhen it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would popand they would make a quick buck. They saw it getdown to $85 and started celebrating...but it startingclimbing...uh oh."

"Remember, if you're playing with options, SELLING premium RESPONSIBLY during high volatility will give you $$$. Buying premium is a newbie mistake. My cash covered puts I sold earlier are now up 25%+. My put debit spreads I bought during the $80s (after I sold my call debit spreads I bought yesterday) are up also 11%. They should close in the money in the next 3 weeks and get my full width payout. Make money in any direction with options kids. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO easy to make money guys. Reading charts like a pro will help you big time."
This is a top brand name to own. Everyone knows Gamestop now.
How many dummies forgot AMC and GME are STILL restricted on many platforms? If the demand wasn’t high and they weren’t worried about this stock skyrocketing then they wouldn’t put limits on the number of shares you can buy. Once restriction is lifted this is flying.
"sorry guys I've been gone for a bit, mom brought lunch down...are we still holding?"
"Just threw my hat in the ring, bought 200 GME in after hours @ 49.20.....falling knife or lucky guess??"
Question is how fast can new management change into digital sales and also use brick in mortar for reselling old / used gaming devices. I m staying long and it’s never going to be known what if they played fairly with this. They don’t play fairly. It’s up to new management & now the retail stock holders for what to do next. It has almost as many locations as about any retailer ( except maybe a Starbucks). Other than holding. What else can be done?
"Attention GME LONGS! Listen up! Here's your strategy at this point, the ONLY OPTION you may have! Follow the gif's instructions! Thanks."
Down 5% Pre market. Looks like the huge downward pressure is over.
"There will probably be another rally.However, ignoring all the hype - this company has a lot going for it. Very solid future. I'll be waiting over the next few months to see more news from the board until I see it settling above $100. If you're in it for the long run, and you're not day trading.. you will likely see this between $100-$180 once all the dust has settled. Stock ratings are scams, they're bought and sold. Look at the board, look at the executives, look at the reports and you'll be better off than 99% of investors. If you have a strong understanding of all the behind the scenes, you'll have stronger conviction and understand the value, and the risk."

"Robinhood's future is 'toast,' says 'Wolf of Wall Street' Jordan BelfortAdam ShapiroAdam ShapiroUpdated February 2, 2021, 9:39 amThe self proclaimed “Wolf of Wall Street,” Jordan Belfort, expects the Robinhood trading platform to go out of business over the GameStop (GME) trading controversy. “I really believe the lawsuits are going to be very problematic,” Belfort told Yahoo Finance Live.Belfort was the founder of the defunct Stratton Oakmont brokerage. He plead guilty in 1999 to running an illegal “pump and dump” stock scheme that cost his clients more than $100 million. Belfort served 22 months in federal prison and later authored a memoir, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which became a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.GameStop shares soared more than 1,600%, in three months, hitting $483 last week and that surprised Belfort. “When I first looked at it I said, ‘Yeah, it's a modified pump and dump,’” he said.Individual stock pickers used Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum to martial an army of retail investors. They used platforms, like Robinhood, to trade up the price of GameStop stock squeezing short sellers like Melvin Capital, which lost billions of dollars.“What the small investors were able to do here is shocking,” Belfort pointed out. “It deserves an applause.”Belfort went on to defend the retail investors, “I don't think it's illegal, because most of them by the way, if you actually go through the message boards they just like, they love the stock. They’re just having fun and they want to kind of stick it to the man more than anything.”"
Got in today at $63. Who's laughing now?
Price target raised to $326 wooooooot wooooooot
We just like the stock tbh
"FROM Greene Concepts Twitter Acct:""Short interest reported for $INKW in December was up a staggering 258%. Numbers not in yet for January short interest, but will be real interested to see what is reported for January short interest"" $GME Had only 141% Short Interest. Buckle Up!!! IF GME can get $4 to $483, why cant a $.06 go to $1????? KEEP HOLDING THE LINE!!!"
The famous reddit investor Deep***Value says fundamental value is 20 $. Are we going there on Monday? And why is it still traded 3 times real value today?
"guys. move on, this was the play last month. there are other stocks you can hold with a better chance of big returns than something that already squeezed a week ago "
Sadly it is dying fast
Bottom feeders are trying hard to keep this afloat and hope for a rebound 2.0. Ain't gonna happen. Listen to Cuban and you will end up broke. No where but down from here.
"Nice lil pop here we go, squeeze time playas . LFG"
We going back to the moon boys
Obviously the strategy is not working. Anyone telling you to continue doing the same thing and expect different results is insane
Would this be a great long term investment? The price looks low based on the last 5 days.
Its odd how gme and amc keep going up or down pre market completely in sync
GME $2000 LMAO
Redditors are holding with 400$ price and think a little rise pre market is good LOL This is doomed
People who made millions should donate money to people who lost 10-20k on gamestop coz its coz of these guys they bought expensive and other guys made millions
$55 coming
HAHAHAHAHAHA COVER SHORTS. COVER!!!!!!!
Buy more put fuel
Guess we're hodling over the weekend too fellas
would be curious if i still saw diamond hands
"I figured out the problem, everyone is taking their money out and moving to $GME"
this going to 12
Thumbs up if you expect to make a lot of money tomorrow with the current trend!
Are we heading for a Friday crash?
"Im in big again,"
Hold and we willl be gold
Why are all the short sellers on here so eager to make everyone sell their shares?
to the moon
The Reddit group are heroes they buy and hold a company imagine that while the shorts try to drive companies like gme and amc into bankruptcy where the rich guy will profit again by buy up assets on the cheap tear the company apart sell off everything lay off people all the while paying themselves billions to destroy the company Reddit group are heroes
back to zero?
"The difference between gambling and investing... when I invest in something, I research the fundamentals and have confidence in the long term. I know that even if the stock goes down after I buy it, I have faith that eventually the stock still will eventually recover to above where I bought it. Gambling is continuously buying into a stock way above where it should be priced, no research, no fundamentals. I really feel for everyone who is down 80% from initial investment because frankly, this company will never get back up there. I support the spirit of the movement, but if you lost a lot of money here, it’s a good lesson going forward"
Is it at $1000 yet?

"Guys, there's a company, that sells games and gaming gear behind this stock. It's not doing very well, hasn't for years. Thus it's been heavily shorted. You can squeeze and squeeze, but its going to revert back its pre-squeeze level. Cause the company stock value is between $10 and $20. Based on its fundamentals."
So is this now a strong buy or a really strong buy?
"If you're young and made profits from GME, AMC and the like, (meaning you sold) put some of it in the ETF's QQQ or IVV, or VOO. Hold for decades and you'll easily be a millionaire. Best of luck to you."
Has reddit figured out that all those people posting that they just bought 5k shares at 400 were using inspect element yet? Did it never occur to them that something was fishy when every other post for 3 days was people claiming to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on this at the #$%$ top?
It’s dropping on low volume.. no one is selling... mark cuban says hold..
Set limit orders well above market price!
"After having a long, hard think about where to go from here, I have decided to sell all my positions today, unless we receive information today that gives us a much more certain direction for the future. I was lucky enough to get in early, so should still secure a decent profit, obviously nowhere near last weeks highs, but profit is profit, so I can't be too upset. I will continue to follow the situation, especially in the coming weeks when the official short data is released. It has been a fun and crazy ride, with many ups and downs, but in the end the big guys resorted to their not-so-secret weapon being market manipulation, screwing us all over. While this may be the end of the gamestop short squeeze, this certainly wont be the end of the discussion around it. Expect many changes to the way shorts are regulated and reported in the future, as well as investigations to potential market manipulation from both hedge funds and brokers.Many have been exposed from this situation, which I think is great for retail investors everywhere, as it shows them no matter what they do in the market, if the big guys aren't happy, they just make a few calls to their buddies and they'll come out the situation perfectly fine."
Is anyone buying the gamma squeeze propaganda anymore?
72-80 close thoughts?
"Nothing ever changes on Wall Street. No, it's not different this time. Bubbles are always popped. The dump always follows the pump. Greed is followed by fear. Don't listen to those urging you to hold grossly overpriced stock. Sheep will be fleeced as always."
This is unbelievable WOW
They go 76.85 you go 86.75 that's how you win don't fall for the sell pressure I'm only holding one share it can go to zero for all I care but if you want to win this is what you have to do
GAME STOP!
stop halting and let it fly
Anyone else holding from $300+?

"The manipulation in all of this is disgusting. I'm holding my $GME, $AMC, and $NOK, I don't even care if the price drops. I'm in this for more than money, and the less volume they have to buy up, the more screwed hedgefunds are. Period!"
"They control our Reddit channels now just be cautious, we got played... We do not buy Silver! Volume on GME is history, our bets are AMC and NOK at least they have a future. Make your own choices from here it is your money after all. Gl guys"
Today was the dead cat bounce
Dont sell into a diving market!
$1000 this time!!!!!
Soooo what’s new today? The SEC is investigating DFV for his direct relationship with Hedge Funds.You were all used!! 
If you think this is over all you have to do is watch the threads— why would someone be so hell bent on you selling and telling you it is over— everyone needs to make the best choice fir their own specific circumstance but the shorts haven’t been covered and this could go in fir quite some time— with the ladder shorts making it seem like people are selling when in reality the hedge funds and swapping the same shares back and forth— if you had a level 2 platform you would see it plain as day. The reality is the majority of people are holding strong. Think of it as the greatest income redistribution you may ever see— because the billions being lost but hedge funds fir assuming ridiculous risks —well on the other end the retail investor is reaping the benefit of the hedge funds irresponsibility. Diamond Hands we’ve got this!
How many new purchasers! Like my comment let’s see
SELL
VW dipped over 50% before Buy and hold!
Buy a real stock apple do yourselves a favor
Still so entertained by this board i may buy more further otm puts tomorrow with my gains just to stay here and laugh.
This stock is hanging in there pretty well after hours. Good sign for tomorrow. Diamond hands!!!
The hedge funds deserve to lose billions rigging the market daily and in every stock. This happened to be one of their cash cows that they completely controlled that happened to be discovered.
"Buy and hold, GME is still shorted way above 100%. The amount of paid shills/bots speaks for itself, the hedgefunds are getting desperate. Google ""volkswagen short squeeze"", that's what we're in for! See you at $1000 "
Who bought at 400?
lol today we have the third episode of gme
Amazing how closely the GME charts resemble the VW charts prior to the squeeze....
6b revenue and SGA vastly will be improved due to online versus store. Seems low value
@Deepesh covering rate is not enough for free flow in the market . Shorts have to cover and I can wait
Buy HUYA and NIO. Thank me later. It’s time to turn the clocks on short sellers. These are two rapidly growing healthy companies.
"A lot of people saying “ I like this stock “, doesn’t mean it’s a good stock to invest in . Oh I like video games , oh I like movie theatres etc... fundamentals over emotions pls from now on"
200 in 10min watch it
"To anyone who is still in hopes of selling at 100+ look at the 1 month chart. The show is over. There was never a guarantee for this stock to go 1000+$ or else everyone would have done it without risk. The short squeeze happened and the stock went to 450 but now it's done. If you're still holding, it may hurt to sell at this price but a week down the line when it's back to 30 you'll feel a little better."
HEADSUP this is dropping another -20 tomorrow!! Don’t say I didn’t warn ya (AGAIN)
this will be 20 bucks by friday
Thanks I bought more 10 more shares at 60.I will buy more later if it drops.ideally drops to 5 dollars and I buy 1000 shares.at 50 I'll buy another 20 sharesat 20 dollars ill buy 50 sharesAt 10 dollars I'll buy 100 sharesThanks guys.
"Why did people think this was going to be a fast play? weeks.... months even but if you bought in high you may as well hold now.The whole point is to buy and hold so there are no shares for the shorts to buy. Then they have to pay interest on all the hares they are failing to deliver, when interest is killing them they will start paying higher prices. This was never meant to happen fast. Hype made the price jump, media hype. Once media gets tired of it the actual squeeze can happen"
No fundamentals and no support!!
"I've always thought to get to the moon, you went upwards. Guess I was wrong."
Take the 51.80 and count your blessings! It's a bargain. That will down to 40 by tonight or early tomorrow.
I'm still not leaving. Shorts have to cover AMC and $GME
THE SKY IS FALLING
123$ today
"Whatever the result of stock shortinggovernment policy will be, it will be good or bad for all those investors who purchased stocks in panic or sold in panic. However the GameStop got a huge publicity and advertisement for free. Now they have a great chance to grow their business 10 folds."
"for those who buy now, just know you're buying something that has no hype, no short to squeeze and that is hated by hedge funds who control the game. Short are now buying options they are not as stressed out ... Good luck ;/"
GME!!! back to $17?
"500 at 62 today , 2.56% up in ah thanks good day today back for more Monday"
can you move on to something else already? Pretty sure your element of surprise is gone and you split your masses over 5 different stocks instead of everyone on one and then moving on to the next. Say you're loyal all you want but when it's your turn to lose you will bail like the rest.
Hope everyone is hoping on the NAKD train it’s literally mimicking GME last week
"Nobody knows the current short interest, no one, even the SEC doesn't know. Imagine if anyone knew the exact number of shorts at any given time, that would break the system. There would be no point to shortselling if it was live. You go by reports and volume/time. The big Bberg terminal is best at doing the math but even it doesn't know. If you've been in the market for a while, you can safely tell if a full cover has been executed or not, in GME's case, obviously it's not even close."
Anyone who bought over 400 still holding?
2 weeks ago this was trading at $19...that was high because people were loading in hoping for a squeeze. This is a sub $10 stock when the hype is pulled out over next few weeks. If you own sell now and make some money than buy puts!
If GME does this.... stock will crash faster than predicted!! lolundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) closed a share offering valued at roughly $74.5 million this week.
"Told you it’s going to trade sideways for a while, volatility will come down drastically"
GREEN MEANS GO>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Hedge Funds making deals with Hedge Funds. This should be interesting. HA!
Is there anyone that doesn't think the Hedge funds shorted this stock at $400+??
People that sell in the low $80s gonna be crying when it gets to low 100s in a few hours
"All these boomers spreading fear, you'd almost forget they have something to lose if it doesn't work. $GME :rocket:"
Great opportunity to buy
The reason AMC and $GME has dropped is because RH stopped allowing you to buy shares of these companies. Then they said you’re only allowed to have so many shares and that if you had more than you can’t buy more shares. TOTAL FRAUD.
Mark Cuban told me to hold.
Still almost 30 million shares short. All it takes one big push and the squeeze starts again
"$GME $AMC SEC reportedly probing whether fraudulent social media posts boosted GameStopDid misinformation boost prices?By Jacob Kastrenakes on February 3, 2021 4:49 pmInvestigating pumpers on Reddit, ST and Yahoo. "
"When is the next run? I know bots will say never but they said never every time before it ran.. they said never before the run to 90 today... So seriously, when is the next run?"
I’m pretty ok with losing the $300 I paid for one share!
Gap up to 120-150 today and setting up for a strong Friday!!!
Ima say it again. The naysayers wouldn't even bother typing on this board if they weren't in some type of loss. Give em love while they're here
All I can say is OMG
"If you are buyer, please use a cash account at your brokerage. If you use a cash account your shares cannot be used (borrowed) for short selling (without your permission). If you are buyer, and believe in the thesis that the stock is still over-shorted (naked) please do not invest more than you can absolutely afford to lose."
"The Short's Game is still in play... they slowly walk it up the stairs,then SLAM SELL it down hard on all the new money like an elevator"

Bears after losing it all tryna short GME
I just got my shoes shined. Dude used a $400 paper GME share certificate.
Still the most epic event ever but....
Fair value is 5 bucks.
I'm currently unemployed and disabled. I opened up a business and claimed covid relief. bet it all on gme at rock bottom prices. I might have noodle legs but these diamond hands won't sell. trudeau invested 50k into this stock on my behalf
Quitters never win and winners never quit ...... long and strong all day everyday !!!!! $GME $AMC $KOSS $BB $BBBY $NAKD keep holding show them the people carry power too lets do this together !!!
IMO. NO MORE SHARES TO BUY. OFFERING IS REQUIRED. IF THE MAJORITY JUST HOLD. POSSIBLY GOING TO $1000.
Are we still Holding?I’m losing on paper only.
"The short squeeze has not yet happened. If it had, why would they tell us it had happened? They would have nothing to gain from telling us that. This just further proves the shorts haven't covered their positions and are just tryna get people to sell, but that won't work. All that remains are the diamond handed chads who will hold even if this goes back down to $4, as they know this price doesn't matter. Liquidity is drying up and when the hedgies have to cover their positions, they have to pay what we want them to pay, $69,420. Hold and you will go down in history, sell and be remembered as a paper handed bit "
hold up. TODAY! TODAY!!?? Today robinhood lifts it's trade restrictions??!!! #RobinCROOKS
"Predict GME will have share offering before share price hits $20. In any case, stock price down BIG!!"
Can someone with facts tell. Should we hold or buy more? Or just get out now?

"When the dust settles on this, there will be a lot of depressed bag holders, angrily waiting for this to rise again. It won’t rise again, because the market they are in has died a death already, so waiting for it to come back up is not an option here (unless miraculously retail space suddenly goes through the roof - which is virtually impossible in this day and age)! Then the blame game begins, and the faceless investors of Wallstreetbets will, one by one, slowly edge away from being associated with the Reddit group! Remember folks - the Casino always wins! Its a fact of life that if you live within a capitalist system - be it Vegas or Macau - that you must accept. Agreed - its slapped several short sellers in the face, but they have the money, resources, and legal protection to fight back!When the blame game starts, it won’t be Wall Street taking the fall, rather the faceless reddit activists.Im not saying this is right, but if you are sitting at capitalisms big casino wheel then you only have yourself to blame at the end of the day!..........................."
Robinhood actually helped the longs. They forced them to sell between 300-400 and now these longs are buying back in the 60's. So no doubt the stock goes back up but now the new short sellers think they can make their money back. The newshort sellers are stuck because they think its going to $20. Delusional short sellers I say.
I wish I could had traded at 4 so I could had scooped those 70s. Dude the manipulation was real !!

Stonks go up because people LIKE THE STOCK. It has very little to do with the underlying business. As a shareholder if you own a stock that does not yield a profit sharing (i.e. dividends) than you literally only own the stock because you are banking on others liking the stock in the future. The price is relative to itself. Gamestop is worldwide now. People like this stock. It will bounce back.
short queeze happens today!
don't be fooled by the price keep pushing it up

What do you expect the stock price will be when you have BROKERAGES limiting buy orders on $BANG shares And NO LIMITATION ON people seeking? These institutions rigged the supply and demand of these stocks the past week. They should be sued and sued and make them pay for all the losses in my opinion. I’m a Blackberry holder. Feel I need to say this I’m GME board since I see you guys are suffering so much from the Wall Street Crooks!
more shorts getting beat today that have to cover their shares! No one thought it would be above $20 this year.... shorts are still expiring

So what’s the deal with stoping shorts from ladder trading? I hear that since the shares they are using are naked (not shares they borrowed) they will not be allowed to drive shares down using that method.

POP QUIZ!!! Is the price closer to 2.57 or 483?
"GUYS, after the dust settles what do you believe GME stock price will be?"
This is not just American thing. People from all over the world will be buying GME this afternoon.
Why doesn't it halt when it goes down like that? Two sets of rules for Hedge Funds/Shorts? Seriously?
so if the company comes out and says they are declaring bankruptcy are you guys still going to be buying the shares?
why hasnt GME raised any capital via a stock offering? add some stock to the float and bring in capital to fix and retool the company.... its a simple and legit question....
Which one are you?

"I bought yesterday one share of GME with a limit price. I have an email alert notifying me of the order execution at that price. I only own one share in that account. Today, my online account is showing a unit cost higher than yesterday”s execution limit price. It shows that I am losing more money than what I had expected. Can that happen on any limit trade?

"Predictable...These events with companies like Gamestop have one or two day blips, or even intraday blips that get everybody excited. Then when the drop continues, out come the accusations of some sort of market manipulation.Hey, the markets have always been manipulated by those have the wherewithal to do it. The trick is to not get taken to the cleaners by the powerful. Anybody who jumped on this bandwagon at over $100/share is going to get hurt. The question is how much are you going to let them hurt YOU? Do you take your lumps by catching a $70 mini peak? or do you ride this back to under $20, losing at least 80%? The choice is really yours. Investing is risky, particularly when you invest in companies that lose money."
"226% short float. Yeah, that sounds legal."

If Gamestop doesn't issue shares here then that's a mistake. They will not have benefited very much from this whole fiasco. If anything they were harmed because their shareholders got replaced with uneducated Reddit bagholders.
"GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video-game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video-game stores.

IF 4 MILLION $ A PIECE!! approx!! 1 B $$ / now GameStop owns 5509 buildings in 14 countries!! 5509 x 3m $$ each = 16.5 Billion $$$! THE ENTERPRISE VALUE is listed at 23.4 Billion $$ / 23.4 B div common Shares 69.75 = $335.00 per share !!!

Everyone on this board is talking about the hype and fall of GME. No one is saying a word about the business and earnings of GME. Due to pandemic people are at home watching and renting videos at home. Is it going to make a difference in their business at all? What can we expect about their next earnings? Is there any buyer (BABA or else) for this company? etc. Any comment please.of GME.

"all big gold miners to report their Q in next 2 weeks, and they got huge huge short position in themK.to to report on wednesday and 20% short position...she can jump 30% easyGlobe/wire say Barrick, others see short bets rise2021-01-06 09:16 ET - In the NewsSee In the News (C-ABX) Barrick Gold CorpThe Globe and Mail reports in its Wednesday edition that hedge funds have increased bets against major gold miners as COVID-19 vaccines weakened expectations for the metal after a year of record gains. A Reuters dispatch to The Globe says that gold prices have dipped from last year's record highs above $2,000 an ounce as investors turn to stocks that do well in times of economic growth. Short trades as a percentage of total traded volume for Barrick rose to 24.8 per cent for the second half of last month, from 14.9 per cent for the first half of December. Newmont saw an increase to 11.4 per cent from 8.8 per cent over the same period, while trades in Kinross rose to 20.6 per cent, from 18.2 per cent, according Reuters data. Hedge funds typically engage in the practice of short selling by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back at a lower price when shares fall, pocketing the difference. Tougher lockdown restrictions to combat a new variant of the virus and huge government debt nonetheless could propel gold higher. Short bets against miners Yamana fell to 17.7 per cent, from 25.7 per cent, while the number for Alamos fell to 19.5 per cent from 21.9 per cent. 2021 Canjex Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved."

This is kinda what happens when you invest in a company based on hype instead of fundamentals of a business. GameStop is dying just like most brick and mortar stores. In the end the actual value of the company always comes back and reality is this company is headed down. Take your losses or hell hold if you feel that strongly about it and don’t need the money. Many of you took a risk and it didn’t pay off just hope you didn’t rely on this to save your life

"The millennial crowd who tried to push $GME and $AMC also flood $TSLA and $SPCE to bubbles.These bubbles will pop too.Tesla has NEVER made a profit from selling cars. It’s a fact. Without tax credits they would be bankrupt.Virgin Galactic is a pipe dream. Not investable. No serious sales or cash flow.In the meantime, REAL companies like $XOM $ET $GEL $OXY are now cash flow positive since oil is $54...they’ve been cash flow positive since $45.Will the kids learn that you should invest in real companies that actually make money?? I’ll go ahead and guess I’ll get a bunch of thumbs down. I’ll go ahead and predict comments that say, “Boomer”, “Boomer stocks”, “Oil is dead”....You know all, of the super intelligent things this group says when challenged. Right now you have an opportunity to buy the best energy companies in the world for 1/2 off. Better do it before the hedge funds start moving cash away from your favorite bubbles and toward real companies."
short resitriction already applied?
Be very carefulGME might do a capital raise today They have a fiduciary duty to protect the companySo they will be highly criticized if they have the free money and did not take it or act upon it

Empty bag time shortly
"EVERY TRADER should be asking 1 question...Why in this day and age is the % AND amount of the amount of shares Shorted NOT listed,,,but 2 weeks or more late? Its nuts if not criminal. And why do hedge funds not have too list their short positions as they must list their long positions? Write your congressman. I do not own GME but I know this stock since 2001. It was a good dividend stock for years on end. The hedge funds have target this stock in a very sick way. Took a decade to give up on their dividend. They bought back shares to slow down the shorts."

Tesla might face worst sell off if he can't sell all those car produced. $TSLA will worth $20.He has push his fan club into this stock at 300's. And he does not do anything this will go in history very badly."
"why it halts? BUY BUY BUY, Hold Hold Hold to the mooooon!"
Whooo still holdin dat line B
At what price do the shorts break even? Did Mark Cuban offer any free advice today?
Big squeeze coming tomorrow! Should squeeze down to $25 or maybe $27.
"I don't know whether you guys remember exactly a year ago, when Covid was declared a pandemic, when lockdowns were expected, when stock plummeted, all indices were heading down the drain, I do not recall any brokerages halting any trading, ever!"
"$AMC Here is what I think is happening with $GME and $AMC. I think a lot of the people have decided to get into different stocks and others plays for the time being such as $CCIV $APXT etc., until the whole stupid restrictions with the brokers are lifted. Because with Robinhood and the others, they are still limiting the amount of shares that people can buy. People are either getting into different plays or opening up a new brokerage account which takes 3-5 business days for the funds to be deposited. But I think there maybe one more push for $AMC and $GME in the next couple of days. When the hedge funds ease up and are a sleep that is when the people will attack. I maybe wrong, but that is just my opinion. Plus Robinhood CEO is so worried about their business now because he knows so many people are leaving , I think more restrictions may be lifted in the upcoming days. So stay strong and buy back into $AMC and HOLD. We can at least get $AMC up to a price target of $20."
sell your contracts so I can buy in cheaper 
to me when i buy stock...i assumed that i am the CEO owner of the company...i should know exactly what is in my books ! even withouth presence of the CPA...

"Just called Melvin Capital. They told me ""Sir, please hold"""
Shorting seems so easy at this point. But long is now promising to about 150?
"There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea thatGameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and thereis no chance at survival. That is simply not the case.I don't want to do a full GME DD here. However, let me putit to you this way:If you were told thata new company was IPO'ing and itwas coming to the market with an infrastructure, newtalented team, 50 million customers and their plan wasto become an e-commerce company to compete withAmazon, their plans for the physical locations was to begame-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktopbuilding kiosks, and the newest systems and physicalcopies of games for those who still love having a physicalcopy. Not just that, but this company already has revenueshare deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies.Knowing all that information would you be interestedin this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thingwith digital transformation and companies changingdirection is people get so lost in what the company usedto be they cant see what the company is planning onbecoming. If this was a brand new company that RyanCohen was leading with the same exact model peoplewould be all over the concept."
Get out the price floor is $20 tomorrow
"This is going to fly up to $120 at least today, nobody is recognizing the army behind this. MOON BALL SQUEEZE JOIN IN NOW"
Like I said before Robinhood restricted buy of GME share in allowing the financial institutions to recover their losses...Designed plan then the institutions bought share and hedged their bets. Profiting on both sides of the trade.
"Buy now bro,just I do it!"
"if it can get to 69$ we can bring it to 420$ then we can get it to 69,420.69$. keep holding. not actual advice lol"
Whether or not you believe the short situation why would you sell now at a loss? Hold and let it play out WITHOUT your shares! HOLD HOLD HOLD!
"I was never part of the little army trying to stick it to hedge funds or ""the man."" I was just in to make a little money. I saw the momentum, took a chance, watched the price movements like a hawk for a couple days, then bailed when I had a profit of 2k. In 2 days. Not bad. But I will get hate and ""paper hands"" comments from those who either got in real high and are probably toast, or those who actually thought it would hit 500-1000. Don't hate the player, hate the game. Be like me. Be more cautious in your future investing. Greed usually doesn't pay."
$30 a share today $20 Monday 49 cents Tuesday then the big bankruptcy
Anyone winners in here that can buy a SuperBowl commercial for GME & AMC 
"120% short interest ---hedge funds have created FAKE shares, to short more -- fraudulent illegal activityand now as you can see from this msg board, retail sheep are tryin to piggyback on hedgefund short, by shorting themselves. Yeah this is gonna end well for you guys short shorted at 90 today praying for ten tomorrow.Enjoy the rocket ride back to 250!"
Back to 400
"little known fact: the only GME seller is a GME short... Diamond hands, baby!"

How can anyone be bullish on a failed business whose stock price has lost half their money today
Gamestop tried to Sell me a game for $30 more than I could buy it online. Going out of business soon.
"I have done extensive research on GME and based upon the future potential, I am placing a price target of $891.24/share on GME. I can almost guarantee this. I would share my research will keep it close to the vest for now. GME should hit this price at 2:21pm (CST) on next Wednesday. Mark my words."
Selling GME today at $60 is still 4x better than the consensus estimate of $13.44. This party ended.
Got to feel bad for those who saw $750-$1000 as a target.
Seriously how many fake shares are going to be sold today?
The hedge fund intern calculating the Value-at-Risk on this thing be like
"$SNDL is holding better and looking better then $GME, $AMC, $NAKD and most of the other Reddit stocks."
"GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry. >Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!Wrong.No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*>WHAT?!You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still #$%$ *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about #$%$ ALL OF THEM.I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:**# of Shares - Price**x 20 - $0.30cx 80 - $5x 400 - $20x 600 - $40x 900 - $60x 2,000 - $100x 5,000 - $150x 10,000 - $200x 30,000 - $300x 50,000 - $400x 150,000 - $500x 1 mil - $1,000x 15 mil - $5,000x 30 mil - $69,420Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.Get it?*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones. This isn't financial advice, but HOLD"
Holding up better than I thought it would.
wait why are they not halting trading on the way down?
"It is very interesting that the, Treasury Secretary, waited to make a statemen referring only to the fact that “We have to protect retail investors”, but yet still allowed all of this to happen. I find her statement inadequate and worthless! As the hedge funds, 40% of Robinhood, continued to break the law by pumping fake news, convincing the wire houses/BD’s to disallow purchasing of BB, GME, AMC, and faking a silver rush ... all while being allowed, by the wire houses/BD’s to trade everything, the hedge funds got the uppper hand by cheating while the retail investors (Little Guys) got crushed by only being allowed to sell. I really hope that all of the Reddit people come back to GME and start again for round two..."
Don’t let halt panic u
Ouch.....that hurts.......
what's the exit strategy in a game of musical chairs?
Once these shorts lose control again. This will be back over $100 in a blink of an eye.
"hold buy hold buy, How they can cover shorts, if nobody is selling, all synthetics shares are circulating.Don't be afraid hold."
going to see 200 again.... by Friday
Brick and mortar prices for a future online powerhouse
"Good rise on good volume. Solid drug, in at ground floor, shorts distracted by $GME. Welcome aboard, new investors!Next step, all new investors need to learn about this drug's efficacy in LR-MDS and MF, understand the design of our two Phase IIIs now enrolling, PDUFA, buyout potential, etc. Check out the other MPN and combo potentials. Then share the facts with others.Required reading: ImetelChat (Google it) and anything by Lazarus on this board. Oh, and feel free to go ahead and mute our board clowns, Ken, K, Short, etc."
Doubled down again at $69
Shorts thank you!!! You are making this second squeeze possible!!!
IS DFV STILL IN?
Already breached $40s range... Look for more downward movement to $20s. Use the bounce as selling opportunity.
Can't believe I am holding this over the weekend... I am either a genius or have a death wish.
$20 today?? Man these people should of sold when they had a chance. Cut your losses with proper risk management. Live to fight another day.
How come we're not getting any support from the Hollywood and the wealthy movie celebrities?
So who bought @ 400? Just curious
every $3 someone buys like 2 shares and it pops up for a couple minutes then keeps going down lol seriously who is buying?
If it drops so easily why did the brokers prevent people buying?
YES MY FRIENDS WE WILL DO IT TOGETHER
My chart shows another daily low within 20 minutes! Rock on!
We are about to get a $GME kind of pop tomorrow. 300%+

"The entire old guard of wall street institutions have been out in force against GME trying to short it, putting out media hit pieces, throwing tantrums, manipulating buying power, FEAR mongering you name it and they STILL cannot push this back to where it was pre squeeze lololol"
Red again?
2 mil volume already they are probably covering to get it up to 10 - 20 % for the opening bell as to have retail purchase at a higher rate before they start shorting again. If you purchase right off the bat n it drops don’t fret. Best to wait for the dip and catch those lower prices in bulk.
gonna show a lil green to manipulate the price and then go red once again.
I will hold all my shares of it until it hits 0. You’re never actually losing money until you sell. It’s apart of the game some of y’all need to realize how to play it.
If you think this is the same type of stock as $AMC & $GME do some research. Google “Nokia institutional investors” & “Nokia Daimler” or even “Nokia Apple” or “Nokia Microsoft” or “Nokia Facebook” or “Nokia Google” or “Nokia Intel” or “Nokia SoftBank” or “Nokia T-Mobile” or “Nokia US govt”
"got in at 54.90 just before the closing bell 15h43 pm , scary moments though , now i feel safe"
$75 by end of today? Keep pushing it. I did my part!
Time to sell
oops goodbye 60's
I just want to know how many insiders dumped at 200 and up.....I bet every single one of them
$80+ after halt lol!

Don't listen to these haters. Even if your investment drops by 50% it will gain a 100% if it recovers back to your original price. Thats a net 50% gain. Stay long and strong.
Keep your one shared and never sell but trade the rest $85-$110 is making shorts pay huge amount of interest not reported on buffet channel CNBC!
"The shorts holding now are the guys who shorted at $500, $400, $300, $200. You are not squeezing these guys out. The only ones getting squeezed now are the bag holders."
"YO, IT'S GREEN PRE-MARKET"
"If you still have GME shares at this point, consider yourself a bag holder."
This is how the shorts were acting before with such arrogance I am still holding who knows how high this can go just have to hold and buy the lower it goes the cheaper the shares get making it easy to collect and hold for a long time ... big surge on the way I am praying feel free to join on your own. $AMC $GME If prayers aren't your cup of tea then you can still continue to support in your own positive way. We are here for each other and I for one will not sell and will keep buying.
CALM BEFORE THE STORM
It's rocketing after a dip just after market open in Germany.But you don't hear the bears when that happens. :-)
Gamestop could buyout companies therefore making it worth it's valuation hypothetical but possible
Support amc now. They short ladder at the highest
Idk if holding is a wise move but selling of my 1000 shares with a cost ave of $4.31 ($4310.00) 472 sold at $411.00 & 528 sold at $397.00 overall gain in value $400k+ If y’all didn’t sell in the $300 range after a high of $450 that was your mistake. Any sudden drops in price of 15% is more then a trading range .
"Too many shorts here, why ?"
LETS GO $AMC
Bloomberg saying the GME stock may go back to $350’in next trading sessions.
buy now when ppl fear. sell when ppl think its going to the moon!
In times like these I like to reflect on some advice my Broker gave to me a while back...
I am confirming my $5 target on this. Management didn't do anything...Strong sell $5 at max.
Why buy? Because we like the stock.Because they're about to tap into new markets.Because they're visibly about to reform.
Shorts ain't covering. they are doubling down and shorting more.
This was a sell at 500. What more do you want on a trade?
"The thing no one is realizing, is that these hedge funds are not shorting this anymore. If they weren't shorting already, some held, but none have issued any new shorts. The same people who drove the price up are driving it back down using puts. This is setting up to be a HUGE bounce. Wait for it."
"I thought stonks only go up, what's going on here?"
Can anyone who is long actually read a chart??? The technicals are even worse than the fundamentals.
We are winning.Hold
"""Today, a motivated short seller can spread a false rumor about a company — and in the process, send a stock price south fast enough to turn a quick buck. "" The truth about the despicable practices happening in the shadows of the stock market is getting some light. Hold strong."
Jeez the basher are working second shift tonight. Ladder trading stops tomorrow. Let’s see what’s to come.
"With a near 50% loss yesterday people will be fools to “hold in line” some people have literally invested all they’ve got into this “pump and dump” the folks who got out last week  the people still in here, a good exit strategy: sell ASAP get out while you still have some funds left over take those and invest in a cheaper stock not hyped up (nakd has been consistent and off the radar from media) and recover some of your losses. This is the best advice one can give. Those insisting to hold are trying to keep people in the stock in hopes the small spikes up would manipulate new buyers to buy in to raise the stock value up so people could cash out. In theory that is the way to do it but pull out a calculator and calculate the market cap of this stock last I checked 6 billion and what kind of buyers/sold shares you would need for this stock to move up drastically. After solving that equation I’m sure you’ll also see what the “sell suggestion” group of people see. I bought this stock last week and dumped it last week and managed to come out with a profit but like Jimmy Chill tweeted “the ’s always win” remember your in this to make money you holding the bag and showing loyalty to people you don’t know was never the plan... look into the nakd stock who knows maybe some will recover a good chunk of money it’s on a dip I’m sure many can afford a good chunk of shares so when it even goes up a mere .30 it’ll make a big difference. #daytrading101 I’m also apart of Jim Cramers subscription chat and earlier today after mad money this stock along with Super Bowl stocks were a topic of discussion."
150 tomorrow
Amc opening up and Blackrock bought 3.3 million shares. See you tomorrow in the moon
Don’t worry! Money is only for buying things like food and rent
"I’m still shocked ppl were bragging bout buying dips today, congrats u are already down"
"better buy AAPL , new car is on the talk Georgia prodcution. Buy MCD...fast food never fails....AMZN, AAPL will pop on Pre market. Game Stop will break 100 in premarket as well"
"let me guess...roaring kitty DFV is ""still in""........ or is he MIA"
We buying more because love money
NOT TRUE SHORT SQUEEZE WILL MAKE THIS THING ROCKET
What should I do now? I bought 500 share at $286....and still holding...i am just numb now.
Better chance of putting your hand on the sun than getting this to go down
Is anyone watching this? They’re trading millions of shares and the price isn’t changing much- this is preplanned buying and selling imo
What are the chances this stock goes back up? Updown?
HOLD THE LINE AND BUY
"They halted trading twice today for a reason, both times on the way up!!! I am holding and am trying to move some $ around to buy at this dip! I AM HOLDING THE LINE"
What are they yelling? “hold the line” lmao
Game over No pun intended
HOLD!!!!
"Once GME stabilize and retest $80, in a very near future if not today, and whatever the price it settles down, you won't see lower than that price for a while."
"Told you all week to buy $SIRC, every 100$ is now worth 800$ doing another 200% next week. It is only the start there, still huge gains to make."
"It looks like hedge funds are now paying as much to bashers to flood internet message boards with fud, as they are paying interest on their short positions.good, we'll keep buying, and they'll go bankrupt even sooner, spending their last pennies to push out ane last bearish post on Yahoo or stocktwits!"
"Free advice, leave this sinking ship and invest baba, you might get some coins"
reddit bagholders when this finally gets back over $100 so they can get out
"GME good entry point is around 40-50 I feel. Ive sold out position at 80, but the potential is still there even without squeeze.With Ryan Cohen and ecommerce transition I feel the stock can reasonably enter the 100+ range within a year (assuming no squeeze). I can also see a TSLA type slow squeeze happening boosting it further.Short interest is still 120+% using old formula. The new reported SI says 55% but using that formula a stock shorted 400% would only show 80% short interest so I find it highly misleading."
"Im in big,"
"Idk if its just me but all these people shorting on this board and insulting us while giving ""advice"" to sell, just make me want to buy even more. Let's win this battle longs, F the shorts who support hedge funds and RH. HOLD long and strong "
let’s buy PS5 and XBoxs with our gains to pay respect for gamestop
I'm still buying and holding!!!!

"Hi folks, unfortenately you have forget, that end of january is not end of world.Suits were re-shorting again 300+$ positions and are wait for you falls. Final countdown will be end of february (for re-short holders)."
"These losses hurt, and I am forced to get a job at the supermarket. I'm not smart enough to be a cashier, so I will put diamond hands on my resume to show my experience with bag handling."
"Gme won't likely go up because the fundamentals just aren't there. Not surprising that there's a lot of bagholders and its because most people buy stocks like they pick their friends, by what's hot and popular."
Whats max loss for puts and calls this week? $60?
"Stop blaming wall street, the short squeeze plan worked perfectly! But now it’s falling that was in the planning too. It wasn’t always going continue to rise"
We have a Friday and a weekend And support at 43 and change I might be long in the morning if 44 is touched in the regular trading session Yet it’s next week that matters more to me . My buying is purely speculative and I’m looking for a bounce
the local news had a story that GME has plummeted. What are they going to say when it is trading @ $2?
ITS NOT OVER- CALL FOR AN EMERGENCY PROXY VOTE - FORCE THE SHORTS TO COVER! - AND ACCOUNT FOR EVERY SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD- GET A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS -WE CAN ORGANIZE AS A SHAREHOLDER QUORUM!! WE CAN ORGANIZE AND HIRE A SECURITIES LAWYER
"Rents due in three days, but I got faith this baby is gonna moon tomorrow. YOLO"
"So, I was told that it is a good thing that GME is going down for ""dollar cost averaging?"" BBRUH!! You will dollar cost average yourself to ZERO!!"
be interesting to see how many sell off EOD tho
News Flash: Your orders get routed to institutions before it gets filled. Yall been getting played the whole time.
"This stock reminds me of the 1920's pool operators that promoted stocks to retail investors and sold out as they pushed it up. Someone bet big in the trading range and then pumped this on the internet to inexperienced kids with ""stick it to the man and Wall Street"" mantra."
"This play is not over. Strong resistance around 95, lot of shorts in the bushes holding their breath, weak hands are gone. Today is nothing more then a flush out of the timid rookies. Tomorrow mid afternoon the fun starts with a quick spike to +250. Thursday will be a blood bath for shorts, price should hit an easy 850 in early trading, this is when the smart get out, Don’t delay as price goes south fast in afternoon. Friday count your $$$$, buy the old lady something special, and get that new sports car."
Will we get a short squeeze today...seems very cheap compared to Friday!
$53 today$13 tomorrowLife goes back to normal
"will turn this around , with short restriction tomorrow and low sell orders"
T+3 today guys meaning unsettled short contracts go in auction at market price. They've probably bought enough shorts to push the price dow that this battle will last until next contract expiry!
just bought more!
Do you guys believe that Robinhood will lift the 100 share limit from GME? So we can buy as many shares as we want?
If nothing else this has been a fun stock to watch . Good luck to all.
At what point is this a good buying opportunity from a normal investor perspective?
"GME is still shorted way above 100%. The hedgefunds are desperate, which is apparent if you look at the amount of shills/bots posting here, the short-ladder-attacks and the pre/post-market manipulation. The hedgefunds are losing billions each day, they'll have to cover their shorts sooner or later. See you at $3000 "
Short Sellers are already bankrupt a second time...I am traveling backwards... I know...
It’s happening everyone! This was their best effort and we prevailed! Keep holding and buying!!!
"500 shares at $350, 300 shares at $250, 600 shares at $180, 1000 shares at $90. Now i will buy 2000 shares at $79.89. What a bargain."
bought some below $100. Buy and hold.
"I have stood as a neutral observer and watched this for a number of days, these kids seem to have support, resistance is evident, and who knows Monday might be up or down, thinking go in to try and make a little, seriously what do you think any help would be appreciated"
It's time to tell Mommy and Daddy you'll need to live in the basement for another 10 years.
who loaded up at 80?!
Most GameStop stores are closed. And people thought this was going to $400/share.... LOLLOLOLOL
"I bet they are trying to short again, they think its gonna drop. Lol"

yep AMZN is rising before eanings. GME for sure will pop after hours. I am loading both. AAPL will push GME as well due to games on the demand. GME will be the next unicorns on this Q/
"This imo is going to be a rollercoaster day, the momentum is clearly on green and the advance today is incredible, WOW"
Cash poor millennials learned a valuable lesson with worthless meme stocks.
"Not all image post are legit, some of them photoshop it to look they bought something they have not."
is this the gamma squeeze reddit was talking about?
"I need an incredible reason to invest in this next blockbuster video. We download games now, not buy them in a game store. Out of business in less than 2 years."
With Twitch being ruled by people who believe they are deer (not even joking) GameStop could become the next big gaming stream platform easily.YouTube is a huge mess and only big channels are listened to.
HHHOOOOLLLLDDDD THE LINE
I thought Wall Street Hedgies were “Finance Wizards”...Why isn’t the price zero yet..? COME ON GUYS
When was the last time someone shopped at Gamestop? I don't even buy physical copies of games anymore... everything is digital.
Everybody say ... Bye money
Support at $18. Here we come.
I repeat my strong sell call with $5 target.
You can always tell who the bag-holders are...pumping it real good
People who don't understand how the market works.
Robinhood is going to start liquidating your GME stock you bought on margin.Then your Landlord will come for the rent. Good luck with that.
This is real trading now. The defences are weakening - hang in there GME bulls
!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazon AWS Engr Lead joined GameStop...why? what's the next project??????? Anyone?
"Just out of curiosity, i checked out Robinhood. It's absolutely THE WORST investment option I have ever seen. WHY would ANYBODY use it? If you want to do it on your own (I prefer having an advisor) every other option out there (ie, TD Ameritrade) is exponentially better than Robinhood. It's JUNK !"
"don't waste your time and money anymore, tomorrow may drop another 25-30% easy,, save your change and get some coffee.."
"$6.28B market cap at $90/share and these Reddit lemmings think it's cheap LOL.75% of them reading this post are probably Googling ""market cap"" right now."

There is people who have put all their children's savings in GME one woman showed us on a Swedish Facebook group for stocks about 90k $ of her children's savings are now worth 9000$ huge loss she bought at 235$ its so sad
People didn’t lose money in GME due to fair trading. It was rig and taken from the small time investors. I hope all of you who took a lost wins your lawsuit to regain something back. I alway tell investors. You are never in control of the stock market. The market decides when the table will turn. So invest what you can afford to lose. No matter how great the gains may sound.
I feel so bad for those who lost hard earn money in this gambleTake it as a lesson and move on always invest in company dont invest in hype
Gamma Squeeze! Already 7k in volume on the $100 Calls expiring today.
Love how the shorties come out and says stock is tanking...well if you're not worried why post the obvious? My guess is you are worried...haha
When you find out the “dip” you’ve been buying is a bear market.
"The problem is you baggies think GME is a profitable company which it isn't. They have no product to sell. Games are downloaded on Xbox and PS. Amazon sells the rest of their merchandise faster, cheaper, and better.Same with AMC movies are all streamed now. Warner Bros is streaming movies all on HBO Max. Get real man!"
"Two months ago this stock was 6 bucks so if you buy the dip, you will still probably lose 90 percent of your money."
Imagine showing up to a party 4 days late and then just staying because you swear they’ll show up eventually
Hold the line!!! Bwaaaahahahaha!
"All we need to do is wait for the stock to drop by 10, then people will start panic selling (feb 2 feb 4 for example) because they know this stock is useless and much more of a gamble then an actual investment. today was just a bull trap like feb 3. Thank you for the sale on puts. #DelusionalBulls"
"Honest question, I haven't traded options in a hew years, since they expire on the 3rd Friday of a month generally, wouldn't that be the date of the true short squeeze?Ive had GME for a bit in a small amount, sold my initial investment on the run up and only have some profits invested at this point so its a win regardless for me."
Is Gamestop going to go to Zero??

"Let's do the over or under again today for the close. Above 100 thumbs up, Below 100 thumbs down. Currently 103.60 at 2:43 pm est."
another 60% loss day coming but there will still be people waiting for the gamma squeeze or whatever lol
Online trading platform Robinhood removed trading restrictions on shares of GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Inc. late Thursday.
Tomorrow GME will be at $30....
"Still climbing ... sale is almost over ... GAP UP Monday, buy tonight !!!"

wait...wsb was right??
"halt... we're hitting 100 again today, boys... be ready for the dip. don't be discouraged... i'm buying a few shares every dip over 5%... to the moon (eventually!)"
I have noticed that the day after a day where Wall Street take a break (like today) the stocks always crashes with -50 %. Will that also happen on Monday?
Look at these salty boys who missed 50$ opportunity to buy :)
Anyone have that believe this will ever go up 100 bucks club or it’s over n buried ?
"How long can they last? The borrowing rate is less than 5% annually for a hedge fund and they've made a fortune as GME has collapsed back to a normalized valuation (please spare me the silliness about how this trashy bricks-and-mortar retailer is worth $500+ per share). The real question is how long will small retail investors hold onto this stock? When they start selling, which they will, the downward pressure will recommence. If you made a pop on this on the way up, respect. If you bought at or near the top, book the loss now and offset it against other gains."
HOLD GUYS. I STILL HAVE 15000 Shares/$200 but im going to HOLD !!!!!!
I'm really glad it went down again. Now I can get more tendies!
The fact it closed green says it all
"To be fair ( throw DD and fundamentals out) these kids have mobilised a clear message, to the disillusioned kids ,throughout the world , there is a very real possibility that further support is gathered as a result of this evenings performance. The youth is a powerful voice, and may just have enough to lift this again. 850k daily short costs won’t last long imo, Add to that the RH issue and political agenda and you have the litmus paper right there. Remember the youth led uprisings over the last 15 years and you may well have enough to lift this. Institutions will try to short but for how long."
"Strong, vehement upgrade. PT $8000. Mortgage your house and put it into this."
STILL LOTS OF PAIN COMING....UNDER $10 IN 5 DAYS
"LOL... Janey Yellen just got an ""Ethics Waiver"" in order to spearhead the regulatory meeting on the GME fiasco.Why? Cause she took a ""Milly"" from Citadel for ""speaking fees""!!!Just to be clear. One of the central culprits in the breaking of the US markets, form her stint as head of the FED where she bought and monetized US Debt... is going to lead a dog and pony show about the broken markets. Glad to see things have changed"

Good morning to our Warriors.The earlier scare is over. even me with 23K shares and in the red and HOLDING STRONG!!!Their scare tactic wont work on us.1B$ shorts need to be covered imminently.If we hold we could close above 10$ Today. Mark my words!!GO STRONG $AMC $NOK $GME!
Good job everyone. I am hearing now Saudis is also investing on GameStop. $1000 is doable very easily.
Robinhood will be out of business..
This feels like more gambling than investing lmfaooo
"yep, I got mine at 114.59 all myslef. I bought AAPL at 135.03 and AMZN at 3406....ALL will pop after earning of Amazon."
hold!!!!! and make your profit!!!
hold the line !1!1!!!!1!!
"They thought they were chasing the Rainbow and there would be a pot of gold just waiting for them,.....but in reality,..... when most of those who didn't sell when the price was high,.... they lost money. Many lost big $$$$$.Was it worth it ? It's hard enough to pick winners the way it is,..... so use the published fundamentals to help with your investment decisions. They don't cost anything."
the main thing preventing this from poping was robinhood. now that more people can buy with restrictions lifted this can o up %100 in a day
goodluck getting this to 1000 for those that still believe. as soon as this gets pumped up people will start exiting their averages. you are also brave if you hold through the weekend
still holding.
new price la le $1000
There is so much over head technical resistance on this stock as people just want their money back.I don't expect the juniors on here to understand. Maybe if I drew the chart in crayon for them?
Nice :)
No restriction ! Time to squeeze the shorts!
Just be happy you learned from your mistakes when you didn't have more than a stimulus check to lose lol
if you guys think GME is gonna go back up to 400 you have downs
"Just added few more $KOSS and $GMEto count on, though it looks like sky is falling.Whats the limit on KOSS and GME in RH, is it still hurting +vely?"
questions for longs how do you manage to hold so many bags?
GME will close below $50. Sell now. Reinvest in $GEL while it’s under $7. The dividend is 10%. Low volume and low float. Easy to squeeze out value! March 19 $10 CALLS ARE CHEAP
The GENIUS who bought $74 will be a billionaire soon 
"They gave their best, wasn’t fair fight. But this will keep hog funds on their toes in the future"
everyone still chilling? just checking to see if we're at $250 yet.. be back in an hour.
$100 at close
"They say short squeeze is over and yet they still on here bashing and trying to get you to sell. It's not over ppl, it's pretty obvious. "
"LETS CHANGE THE NARRATIVE, NOWWWW!"
"Alright, back.in, boyz.100@88$200@101$Goooo!"
gme is done. Come to amc... even if the squeeze doesnt happen in a few years you will get the money back as the stock can grow when cv19 is gone
"Momentum with retail, and up and up WOW"
There are a lot more bearish folks on this board than bullish. Could be a positive signal for the bulls. It's been the other way around for a while (which frankly was annoying).
Whoever tried and shorted today... I laugh at you
i just sold mine lost 28k
"Back to $2, to the sun."
Mark Cuban pumping it back up on reddit.
"I have told the Feds to direct deposit my new $1400 stimulus check directly into my brokerage account. 8 million Redit Army members will be getting it too. Oh and then add the some of the rest of the curious USA, with a little sprinkle from the rest of the world - will be interesting. Wouldn't the hedge funds just love to stop that check from passing? $1400 may not get you a full share by then. To all the shorts: you wouldn't be so desperate to post if the Hedge funds were actually winning this - this just reassures me that we have you by the *****"
"YO THEY SHORTED MORE STOCKS, MORE SHORT FLOAT AND ITS RISING, THIS SHORT SQUEEZE WILL BE UNBELIEVABLE"
"Unlike $GME, I actually think $AMC as a company and investment has some value. Gamestock has an outdated business model that doesn’t seem to be changing and is getting crushed by $AMZN, whereas AMC is a theater company, and people have been attending theaters since before Christ... there are millions of people who are dying for the opportunity to get on with life—including salty movie theater popcorn and overpriced movie tickets!"
"Gme bots are out in full force !! Look shorting from the top means your broke from the bottom, bag holders are holding. The system is broke and the Bottom line is we are setting the price per share. This is an easy win for the share holder."
where do you think we'll end up today guys? negative and positive outlooks both welcome.
"VOLKSWAGAN HAD THIS SAME CHART IN 2008. SPIKED FIRST, DROPPED FOR 5 DAYS THEN THE REAL SQUEEZE HAPPENED."
Imagine being on a margin account and buying at the peak 
One share !do not buy unless you intend on holding! Another with diamond hands will
I just used my Grandmother's SS check to buy more. She is going to eat cat food but will be worth it in a couple days.
pay no attention to the slight increase. This is the equivalent of the girlfriend giving you one more #$%$ before she breaks up with you.
"""Number of GameStop shares shorted edges higher: S3 Partners - NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of GameStop ( GME ) shares shorted edged higher as the video game retailer's stock price tumbled on Tuesday, according to the latest data from analytics firm S3 Partners.The number of shares shorted was 26.39 million on Tuesday, up from 26.09 million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop's ( GME ) short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $2.38 billion, according to S3.""Round and round and round she goes...."
All I have to do is nothing. I'm good at that.
Chart is still following $GME exactly.
226% short float. That is one big hole the hedge funds have dug.
"What kind of upside down world is this, where GME is worth more than $30"
All longs here should be asking why Jim Craemer is now on the air advocating for GME to issue shares. Does he have friends (or is he) a short here ?For your info I do not have any position here (long short options etc) currently.
Huge option activity calls. I think some hedge funds are joining the battle
"Still countless paid shill-accounts present, that alone speaks for itself. The stock is still shorted way above 100%, the squeeze will come any day. See you at $1000 "
$nakd being spoken about on power lunch!
Looks like a double tap of $68. Thats our new day floor and that means more pain foe the shorts
hey longs. don't quit your day job. the toilets wont clean themselves.
"Yeah it is down today. Good time to load up. This stock needs a new catalyst. Something from the company about the future, a tweet from Musk etc. and then the upward swing will start.Heard that Keith Gill will testify; I think it will be interesting to hear what he says.I sniff a second wave coming."
"Someone is really try hard at the Gamma squeeze today. Over 10k in volume on the 2/5 $800 Calls. They are trading at about .40 per contract, so over $400k on options expiring in 2 days. That is big money, not just Robinhooders. It is crazy that they still cost that much"
We dare them to remove the restrictions on the number of shares you can buy. If they weren’t short and scared af of this skyrocketing then there wouldn’t be any limits on number of shares you can buy. They are scared to lift the restrictions which makes me wanna hold on even longer. LOL.
who's super EXCITED for tomorrow????? raise your thumbs 
"It held its price better than I thought it would. I was guessing it would hit $50 today, not even close."
Why this is still $57? Should be $17
Why were buyers restricted yet sellers unrestricted? STAND FOR SOMETHING or FALL FOR ANYTHING! !
For the retail traders I ask do you really believe shares of gme are underpriced at $130
WE ARENT LEAVING
$AMC lets gooooo $GME already ran up $AMC TURN
really nice way to clean up my boards when all the bashers show up to bandwagon
"Can GameStop turn around? Maybe but it would be very hard. First they are in debt, second they are late into the online retail. Al the major console allows you to buy games and downloaded straight to your console. In 3-5 years, there won’t be any gaming disk, just like we do use cd and dvd disk anymore. The future is streaming. Game stop can’t persuade PlayStation or Xbox, can you please put my GameStop app on your console. They would say hell to the fricken no. We have our own store and we don’t need you! This company has no future. Probably run out of business after this year. Looks like they will raise some more money after this disaster and try one more time to go online. But it’s too late."
also nakd only has .5 days left as of this morning to cover all there shorts ..buy if u can if not then share the info
"Stop posting other stocks. This is the only one that should matter to be honest. Short squeeeze of the existence of mankind happens today! and it starts by buying, then holding!"
"You guys didn’t learn anything on Monday or Tuesday?? Maybe go look at those charts again?? There are no shortcuts to success! Invest in successful, wonderful, growing companies and hold for the long term and you will be rewarded far more than this nonsense!! As Warren Buffet says...’Buy wonderful companies at fair prices’...not ‘Fair companies at wonderful prices’ $koss, $gme, $nakd"

"People, private investors who try to make some extra money on their normal salary: do not fall into the hands of two or more large players with this pyramid game that goes on with respect to GME stock! Say, large hedgefund named PlayerA and another named PlayerB call agree amongst them to do trading as follows: ""Hey B, buy my shares GME for the current price from me and I, playerA will buy the same amount from you right now, lets say 5 seconds from now. And lets do this for a minute back and forth to keep the price aroudn the current price"". So, B buys 1 million shares form A, and A simultaenously take temporarily the same load of shares from B"" Avergae Joe, like me, then see the volmues rise and rise and we think there is a lot of real trading going on. But that is not the case! Players A and players B actually trade just shares between them, they pay maybe a few thousand dollars each as transaction costs to a broker (3rd party maybe in on the game b/c where money goes around it is not always honest business eeeeh?) And during that minute beside the 2x 1million shares BOGUS sales&buy volumes, both players A and B dump another extra 25000 shares each to in this marketplace average Joe's like myself (not me, i do not fall for this trap, i am an outsides looking in on this pyramid game with GameStop). Get out and stay out people. Maybe do this again with millions of people in the near future but make sure it is then another suprise short Squeeze to burn the short players A, B, etc."

"THEY WILL COVER BY LUNCH SENDING SHARES to $1,000!"
"Hi everyone,As a reminder, investors who buy more than 3.5mm shares of stock are legally required to file a form 13D within 10 calendar days of purchasing stock.I believe the position must also disclose whether this is a trading position or whether you intend to be an activist-- I believe this is under Purpose of the Transaction.1.) Purchasing a stock because you feel it's undervalued, or even for a proxy battle, is perfectly legal, moral, ethical, and compliant.2.) One thing I can guarantee is that unless retail longs stand up for these guys, they are going to get hauled off to some sort of Senate or House investigation. Now, to be sure, they have 3-4 minutes of questions to answer. But the people who *really* have the questions to answer are the shorts.3.) One thing that will be interesting on the Form 13Ds is how much stock actually got bought? Are these in cash accounts? Who has custody? 4.) If this percentage ownership is substantial, it would be in the best interests of the owners to consolidate as a control group, even if they all bought individually. 5.) The good news is that if these 13Ds get filed a couple days early, they can still make the original 10-day deadline for control group status, just in case there are any questions whatsoever about whether this is coordinated. ""We're required to file within 10 days anyways; we didn't coordinate, but it made sense to consolidate our holdings once we figured out who the other buyers were. Regardless, Senator, the question is moot, since we could have waited the full 10 days anyways.""6.) If these questions start to get too ruthless, it is time for the rest of the Country to figure out why. What is really behind this? Why is it that a bunch of investors see the deal of the lifetime, buy X% of the stock, HOLD THE STOCK, sit on losses in the stock, and THEY are the ones under investigation, not the people who sold more than 100% of the float. What the heck is going on?Something about this market doesn't make sense to me, but it seems to be on the short side with margined positions, rather than cash longs. We'll have to see what the market clearing condition is in the next two weeks with any 13Ds that come out. It *is* going to be important to be extremely compliant with the 13D requirements. But if you have $350mm to throw at a stock, you've probably got terrific lawyers, including the provision of highly conservative advice getting into this transaction.My guess is that the legislators and regulators will either do the right thing and investigate the bad guy shorts, or they will stand down on this one. A few questions are reasonable for the buyers, but this is capitalism, and if you short a stock into the ground, other people have a right to disagree with you, say it's a good deal, and buy it.And I'm still wondering why the market clearing condition seems broken here unless everyone who bought at $350 saying diamond hands just sold. I still own most of my stock, and I'm happy to ride this elevator down to zero, where I can just buy more. I guess if it gets to $0.01, I'll have to file a 13D at some point, too."
RH can buy 100 GME stocks now
I just donated $1000 to robinhood for not allowing me to buy at $500
Up 17% today while AMC is DOWN 5%. Ha. GME = Winners.
I lost 100 big ones on this trade... couldve bought ten pizzas or a bunch of vr video games... what was i thinking.
"I agree. AMZN will send GME to the moon. Amazon has had solid Q4 based on data from Dec. AMZN will breakout 4000 based on analysts report. So GME has top . Games demand continues....APPLE the same , It will pop along with GME. Buy buy and hold. AMZN will help GME after hours."
I like this stock.
"Reuters reported on Thursday that estimated losses from shorting GameStop had topped $1 billion, while short-sellers across the whole of the US had losses of nearly $71 billion in 2021—a sign that GameStop is the biggest story, but also just the tip of a larger iceberg."
Monday will be a good day!
"If I bought GME at $400 and sold at $70, am I hash-tagging ??"

"My friend works at a Gamestop shop and this is his experienceI am one of the lucky ones who still has a job as most locations are closed. There is hardly any customer. Lately, I see some strange faces showing up and the first thing they ask is if I am part of some hedge fund conspiracy. Then they look around but they stare at the phone every 10 seconds, each time they look more upset. Some will keep repeating YOLO, diamond hands, short squeeze, gamma squeeze, etc. as if they are lost in their own reality. Seriously thinking about quitting and just collect unemployment"
bought 100 shares today.
Setting up for take off
"90% of the negative comments in here and on wallstreetbets are bots.You should be very suspicious of this sudden volume of negative sentiment.The holders still hold, simply because 1000-4000$ are sums most of us don't mind losing (it won't change our lives). BEWARE of the bots."
Imagine if you could have sold at 300??
we control the Market not them
"diamond hands be like ... ""Come on ... Do something!!"" ... LOL!!"
Bought some puts for the first time.. let’s see how this goes  Hype could only go so far.
"IF YOU DONT HOLD GME why would you Hold other stocks???? because if you let Wall Street get away with this, then they'll do it to every other stocks. They haven't covered their short positions thats why they don't have enough shares to let traders trade normally. Why would they allow you to buy only 1 or 2 shares? Since when do the care about your financial situation?"
"$SNDL is also coming back. Look at $GME, Let's make these shorts pay!!!!"
All great Talk about GME right now!!!It’s not Over so get Loaded for Round 2$300 Plus is predicted
"AMC, GME push up , push up"
"last 3 days this has closed at a solid number, meaning 150.00, 90.00, 89.00. chance of that is (somebody do the math) like 1 out of a big number. pure manipulation."
Closed on the low of the day. Not a good sign.
Why so many people mad that others made and are still making money? Not everyone bought it at 300+ ..most of us bought it at under $6
"I traded, lost $500 In 2 days but I believe. What makes you think this is over? This is only the beginning lol. I’m still holding and averaged down because that’s what bosses do"
I’m starting to sense 30$ incoming this week
"Copy and paste: With the SSR in place tomorrow, we could see it bounce back up to around $10 levels. Bulls are coming in and diamond hands are holding. It’s bizarre that we are now stuck in this tuck o-war with the short ladder attacks day in and day out. One thing I would want everyone to know, is that from a technical point of view, this is very very similar to most of the short squeezes that had happened. The reason why $AMC is different though, is because with what’s happened in the last two weeks, especially with $GME; hedge funds had came around to prepare their defences and counter attacks. To sum it up, the short squeeze is still yet to happen, it could be in a few day’s time, but if it ought to happen it will happen before the end of the month. All I can say is, I’m holding and buying until something really dramatic happens. Either them criminals in jail or this flips 400%!"
just hold just hold
Don’t stress it’s going to close at exactly 85
You shorted?
I'm buying this obviously shorted to oblivion stock and bought more today
"If you Believe in Technical Analysis, Then GAME STOP has a chance>>>To Continue Stomping on the SHORTS?? But JUST REMEMBER...it's all TECHNICAL at this JUNCTURE......"

Im a bot for longs. Buy hold buy hold. Diamond hands. We won! Yay! Who cares about financials or business strategy. I like pretty things!!! Beep bop boop bop.
Its sad that this was up $300 and had dropped tremendously yet people are still telling people to hold. Only for people to continue to lose money. Sell this and save some change. This is open around 70 tomorrow. I feel bad I didn't even buy any.
"Mark Cuban said to hold, stonk go up!https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/"
I think it is better to sell all GME shares and invest in google/amzon
"Tl;dr We're going to $800 but only because the hedges planned it and our minor gains are just the tips they're giving us for being used.Okay this is just a crazy conspiracy theory spinning in my head since I started looking into GME this year.I'm fairly new to investing but something about this whole ordeal feel planned. Feel free to correct me on anything, I feel like I only have a very basic surface understanding of this.The most suspicious thing to me is how all this started. So DFV and WSB basically found that Melvin had overshorted GameStop through filings, which is odd given an experienced hedge fund should know better and trade OTC on their shorts. This set off a buying frenzy that drove the prices up to almost $500 at which point with Robinhood shutting down buys cut the momentum instantly. I imagine hedges piled on shorts probably even more excessively than what they had originally shorted and then set off the ladder attacks to drive prices down and will cover their shorts when they feel like they've hit the lowest price.However there's still the shorts placed at the beginning of this play that needs to be covered along with a horde building on WSB looking to drive up the price so they can get themselves out of the high entering prices due to FOMO. BlackRock bought shares as the facilitator to ensure hedges can borrow those to short.To maximize gains, the hedges, after driving down the prices close to their original shorts, can put long positions at the bottom of the price will and then cover all of their original shorts simultaneously, giving everyone the moonshot they were waiting for.Looking at the $800 sweeps placed, I imagine this is where they see the price will be by the time everyone starts to sell. At this point, before dumping their long positions they can do another massive short again. This way they absolutely maximize their gains and utilize WSB to help them do it. After the current low prices, a shot to $800 would satisfy most retail investors who cash out in time around the $800 point with the hedges with a nice handful of tendies. The hedges can also report using the media that they saved the retail investors and are actually the heroes of this story. After taking in profits, most retail investors would probably agree and this saves their image and protect them from any political fall out. It may also provide a boost to the market as the hedges will have quite a bit to reinvest once their three plays are done.Citadel and Point72 probably is aware which is why they invested billions Melvin when it looked like it Melvin was going under. It makes no sense to make such an investment into Melvin at that point (no, being a former boss doesn't mean they should give you billions to loose), unless they were aware of the potential plan Melvin had coming out of it.Those who hold on past 800 too long will probably go bust and GME may actually get shorted/sold into bankruptcy by the end and prove the hedges right at the beginning.In any case this is part of the reason why I'm holding on, while I was #$%$ at the blatant manipulation, I took a moment to think of this situation from the hedge fund perspective and since their main priority should be to maximize gains, this play makes a lot of sense, they also get to appear to save the little guys. It honestly would surprise me if the higher levels of government were informed of the play too, this has the potential to provide something much larger than a stimulus cheque to boost the economy, and the reinvested gains will also be a nice shot in the markets arm. It would also explain why the government hasn't do anything real to halt them or WSB. If WSB really did take down Melvin, small as they are on the scale of hedge funds, it would still affect the market negatively for a little while. If this all plays out, almost everyone wins, except GME and diamond hands that lasted bit too long.We're getting our moonshot but only because we're playing according to their plans."
I'm not making any decisions about selling until I hear from the company.
"Some longs scratching their heads saying "" How am I losing money now, I should have sold at $400.00."
So who’s holding ?? My guess the late investor which never put stop losses on and the run away train came and left the station to quick. Got caught in the fast descent and down now huge. Are you just hoping to recoup a little that has been lost?? Or just don’t care if you lose the dollars?? Or is it about trying to out smart or beat down Wall Street hedge funds ?? Little league trying to play in the big leagues.. I don’t see the play here Fundamentals:The company was losing dollars and on the brink of going broke. Have been for a long time before this run up and will continue which will bring down the stock price IMO Brick and mortar store will be no more soon enough. Feeling the second wave is going to hit and hit hard..
"At this point, why sell? I’ll just wait to see what happens over the next month."
"Great news, Robinhood to lift all restrictions when GME $15 and AMC $4 return to their rightful PPS. Thanks, Robinhood!!"

Large Option Traders Making Aggressive Bets On GameStop
"Don't worry kids, Mark Cuban will pay your tuition."
"As I was saying, Well, here's my opinion: If you are a retail investor that bought GME, sell now. It's going back to its intrinsic value, which is less than $10 per share. Why? Individuals are not going to continue to act collectively. One by one, the individuals will begin to act in their own best self interest. If you want to read more about this human tendency, you can google either of two examples, ""tragedy of the commons"" or ""prisoner's dilemma""."
"perhaps not 85 in 2 mins, but at least 80 soon"
Why does it end at perfect rounded numbers every session
"Who to believe....jeese....can't believe anyone. Mark Cuban said it best. let's see what we have once volume trading is allowed and restrictions lifted. don't invest in more than you can afford.There are 6,610 put options (at targets of 235, 250, 300, 320)We are only in the 7th inning. Time to close out the GME""Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a #$%$ you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.That then accelerates the selling.Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particularSo what to do ?If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street"

"Holy! I thought Ameritrade wasn't allowing new GME short positions last week, I tried and thought it was cancelled so I logged off and never bothered checking. I just checked now and my order was filled! I shorted 2000 shares @ $450! Wow!Happy weekend everyone! Thanks!"
"Look, I do not like short sellers. I think they are a cancer on the investment community. I love that some of them got burned by a group of retail investors that saw an opportunity to create a short squeeze.That said - GME is not a good company, this short squeeze did not help the company somehow magically turn around all their problems. They still have negative earnings, even though they are projected to lose money, they even miss those ""earnings"" projections. They have too much debt, doesn't matter if it was restructured, they are still in debt.At the end of the day, the analysts' projection of $13 rice target is likely spot on long term. Spikes like today are a chance for those that jumped in late to cut their losses, not an indication that this stock is going to go back to $100+."

You call this a rally after GME dropped $400+?!? LOL!!!
Just keep buying and holding! It's the same thing that happened with GameStop. It did not just magically open up at $500 a share. It had weeks of consolidation and shorts pressure. If we continue to hold it will only go up. The shortsellers are running out of time and we have all the time in the world. Let's act like it and stick to the game plan. No selling until we see $1000 a share. And this goes for $GME as well! Just because it already hit $500 does not mean the ride is over. Ignore the media! The reality is it can very well exceed $500 a share which is why Robinhood did that wicked move and restricted investors from buying stocks. Leave RH and ride this up to $1000+ .... Yes other brokerages were restricting but Robinhood's restrictions were by far the worst ...nothing else even comes close to how much money and time they cost us. $AMC $GMEThat Robin steals from the rich and gives to the richer!
Anyone here from 500 dollars/share?

"How to Trigger Short Squeeze 2.0HFs are driving down the price by 40-50% with so little volume because of the low float, guess what, we can do the same as long as we all buy an average of 1-2 to shares in the same day. We can potentially cause the entire situation to blow up. Imagine a situation where at least half the sub buys at least one stock in the same day guess what happens the couple of hundred of shares in the short ladder attack don't matter anymore and due to the low float we could easily see a price increase of over 200% in a single day which will inevitably cause some paper hand shorts to cover causing the short squeeze 2.0. the key here is on the same DAY but what day should we buy on what day would cause the most amount of damage with least amount buys the answer is on Wednesday why, that's simple because there can literally be no more shorting today due to the Nasdaq short sale restrictions, and as long as our buy volume is high enough we can easily start Short Squeeze 2.0.TLDR; we all need to buy today while no new shorts can be opened, the low float can easily cause GME to double or triple in a single day causing Short squeeze 2.0"

2 o'clock by 2 shares!!! Also look at $SIRC we are doubling it by tomorrow great long play! Don't say you wanted in when it was 1$ because that is TODAY!!!
hold
I bought in $GME at $19 before this whole short thing REALLY took off. I was hoping for $60-80 originally. I stayed in and had my finger on the trigger at $460 and got greedy. I eventually sold @ $87. I made a nice amount of money but wow did I leave a LOT of money on the table being stupid and greedy. Ah well..back to $CCIV $JMIA and $SHOP for me :D
"Serious question now, who's to blame for this latest mania? The system for allowing obscene shorting? The original WSB posters who came up with this great idea? The media for giving a megaphone for WSB? The politicians and billionaires who sounded their support to look like they are for the people? The ordinary folks who just wanted in for a piece of the action? Or was it Robinhood who snatched the momentum by limiting transaction on Friday? Who?"
Just remember tmr willBe worst . So don’t hold
Good news is my family will enjoy Ramon noodles every night next few years
FINRA publishes Sunday. This is SHORT COVERING. THEY ARE STILL HERE. WE GOIN TO THE MOOOON!!!
I'm beginning to think the Gamma squeeze isn't coming.....
The shorts are playing a DANGEROUS GAME at this point. Sooner or later the brokers like RH and Cash App will lift restrictions on how many shares of $GME and AMC can be bought and the flood gates of retail will once again be unleashed. I think that smart money understands this and has already unwound their shorts to some SUCKER SHORTS Be patient my friends. This trade isn’t over yet. That’s my opinion and the reason I’m still holding 
 PLEASE LIKE SO IT GETS TO THE TOP WE NEED TO SAVE LIFESIF YOU ARE INTO THIS STOCK AT +100. SELL AT A LOSS NOW. THIS IS GOING SOUTH ALL THE WAY DOWN TO AT LEAST 20. IT'S OVER. DON'T LISTEN TO THESE GUYS. SQUEEZE IS OVER. SHORTS COVERED. EXPERIENCED TRADERS TOOK THEIR PROFITS OFF. ONLY BAGHOLDERS LEFT. PLEASE. SELL. DON'T RUIN YOUR LIFE.
"11.18 % and rising momentum is moving I feel with this support it’s going to stay green today fascinating,"
"Oh it finally dipped below $100?! I was too busy playing games. Sitting on my 600 shares @ $30, waiting for the free market to open. These numbers don't matter to me rn. The market isn't displaying fair value. I'll wait all year. This dip means we are inches away from the MOASS"
stock will make you rich-alto-most undervalued stock ever
down tomorrow to $250.00
Why are you guys buying into a company like Family Video which will eventually go bankrupt? I understand the casinos are closed but you can just keep gambling without common sense!!
i have 100 shares at 250 what shud i do?
i am a retail trader and i have 55$ put that expires today..it will expire worthless. call on amc and bb that will also expire worthless
This stock is a heart attack
Bullish they say .. Hold the line they say ... Diamond hand they say ... To the moon they say ...
"Looks like the ""rebellion"" is mercifully over."
"The stock was going to astronomical numbers and hedge funds and Media were screaming scam, That's what a short squeeze is about, those shorting new but didn't believe this can happened. Now hedge funds with the cooperation of goverment, platforms blocking the buy button, giving limits how many shares you can buy is legal #$%$.... ING traters blowing the price down who knows to what price is legal #$%$ I had only 40 shares got in at 26 sold at 450 because I needed the money to pay out debt what's going on now is fraud"
"OBVIOUS MANIPULATION THEY LET IT DROP BUT HALTED AS SOON AS IT ROSE SHORT LADDER ATTACK, STILL 120% SHORT INTEREST HOLD $GME $AMC"
Sadly it will be 50$ today:(
It's like the people here didn't realize they can just short again....and the billionaires have way more money than this accumulation of stimulus checks.
150$ at close!
Nakd up over 5% since i posted it few mins ago lol....
"I've always been cautious with over-enthusiasm, market overbought conditions, etc. but, I must admit that there is something different here. Retail investors have notably contributed to raise the stock market value for GameStop but, in the end, I'm fully convincend that is a war between hedge funds, and they have much more power than us to move the market in either direction. Therefore, this has not finished yet...nothing could be further from the truth. Good luck, longs!"
to the moon ... der ....
Let's make it happen! Still time to get into $AMC !! Have a good one party ppl!!
what are the chances this is cut in half again tomorrow?
Just sold half my puts. Looks like it might have a little bounce. Nice to lock in profit
"Thank you for the attack, I got 100 shares discount  and hold"
Place your sell well above the ask price this Is how you win this they need the stock it's simple
the 50s up next stay tuned
$NAKD short squeeze inc
It's going back to 200 isn't it?
So the brokers restricted trading to bail out the hedge funds who got caught? Wow! What comes around goes around.
"Remember, you only lost everything if you tell someone... no one has to know !"
"This will be back up and then the ones who sold for a lose will feel stupid again  At this point, with it down this much, you had might as well hold if you haven’t already sold. What’s the point in selling now unless you need the money. Odds are that once RH buyers come back online or finish switching brokers that the prices will surge again and it will be in the news once again. Also, new shorts are in this stock again. I’d say this, either WIN OR LOSE but don’t give up half way. What has changed other than RH manipulating the price for the shorts? Eventually that will change and this will pop again, burning the shorts left in these names. That is the thesis for this trade and it hasn’t changed! $GME"
It is amazing when you invest in good faith in stock and NYSE halted it on the rise and when your broker work against you and the hedge fund manager s try every possible dirty way for you loose money you realize how screwed up the system is!!! Buy GME
Dr. Fauci now says it's not necessary for all teachers to be vaccinated before we can reopen schools.
Loading up the truck here $59. Can’t lose! 0% chance. Just average down here and sell for $110 tomorrow up 100%
I was rooting for sticking it to the hedgefunds... but whoever is still buying GME at these levels probably shouldn't be investing for their own good...
"Now gme in Frankfurt at 45.5 euros ($54.4). Two catalysts that might might a tiny rally today 1) short sale restriction till the 8th of feb, 2) robinhood lifts buying restrictions.The rally would be tiny in my honest opinion. And the selloff would continue next week"
GME halted @ 10:00 a.m. @ $82.77 Something good coming....
"AT 3 PM, LET'S SWING IT OUR WAY. BUY WHATEVER YOU CAN.LIKE THIS SO EVERY DIAMOND HAND CAN GET ONBOARD - 3PM POWER HOUR BUY"
Hold its almost at $1000
Keep holding its almost at $1000
"Its starting to pick up momo... maybe 300 today, 400 tomorro..."
"This GME/AMC/BB saga shown how the system rigged, always halted on way up?"
"STRONG HOLD#$%$Short interest in the GME stock has dropped dramatically from 144% last week to around 20%, according to securities tracking company Fintel, which means that most of the short positions on GameStop have been closed out."
"It's Friday and there is a queue at the entrance to ""buy"" ...."
Chart hasn’t change
"probably open at $40 , jump to $80 and down to under $20 on it's way down to $4 ."
18% gain for the longs today. Not a bad days work.
The amount of people tell us to sell is just hilarious! Full of bots and shorts. When you see chat rooms filled with toxic comments like this it makes you realize how good of a job you did to hold because if you weren’t they would be scared crying all over a board all day Ahahaha! You guys do what you want I’m not here to be anyone’s financial advisor but I’m holdIng mine all the way! GL TO ALL
"To both shorts and longs. Be very careful about what short information you read on the internet at the moment. I spent lots of time doing due diligence and I strongly believe you folks have been duped on both sides... its really quite sick.First thing, no actual short information is published. Not since Wednesday last week. Encourage you to look into why that is, not going to explain it.S3 Partners is a datalake provider that pulls together lots of information about market comings and goings. This is the one that all the media sources are publishing based on. Be aware that they changed how they calculate short interest to account for synthetic shorts. They did so without disclosing it until they got lots of attention on social media about it. The news media sources did not pass this change in calculation along and as a result they have published effectively a doctored state of affairs for the stock. Its shady as hell. A short squeeze as we know it is not coming. Not just yet. The reason is that there is no major positions short despite it being such a large number across a single holder anymore. The stock will rise though because the WSB community has grown substantially. They will continue to buy the stock until eventually a critical mass in it to cause enough float to be removed from circulation that volatility returns. This is evident in the spreads of the order book in the last day of trading and especially in after hours trading. I encourage you to really think about the news sources you are making your trades upon. I will disclose that I am long on this stock, but honestly, i almost sold today until i spent 5 hours reviewing all the data and sources I could find."
Anyone compare the 1 week chart between $GME and $AMCMirror images
Looking for a nice move up with shorts covering before the weekend...
"I bought it cause i like it,you should too..... i don't want to lose my GameStop that's where i go to get my cheap games and it's faster than amazon plus we all have one near us"
trading is knowing when the music has changed .... a stock that does not pay a dividend has a very short song
shorts are out of energy.. on the ropes... another push and they're done...
anyone holding onto over 15k in losses on GME alone ??
It feels like a have a collectible item and everyone wants me to sell it so they jump on it. IM HOLDING TIGHTER AND TIGHTER THE LOWER IT GOES! Y’all ain’t taking my $6 shares. I’ve patiently been waiting for this day.
Transfer any money you have from #GME #AMC to #NAKD they have a product!!! E COMMERCE!! Low float!! Cash in the bank!! Zero Debts!!! It is a no brainer ffs!!
Hold GME Don’t listen to the fakes news media and fake news investors telling you to sell. Hold! I’ve been holding NIO shares since the beginning. Look at my comment history and you’ll see. NIO has gone up over 1000% this past year. I wouldn’t tell you to hold GME if I thought it was gonna crash.
AND... folks that bought and held $AMC are thankful they didn't buy and hold $GME today.
Opening $92 close $150
Buy now this is your chance for those who missed the price under 100’im not letting this slip away this time easy 400% back 400
Baggies be like ...
bought 200 shares......give them to me....ill buy to 2000 shares
halt trading to let the hedge funds out? these slippery guys....
Maybe a covered call candidate?
"Justin Sun crypto billionaire buys 10 mill of GME , where will we be Monday"
I am investing in Mental Therapy companies. I have a feeling huge demand coming.
CNBC will implode if retail likes GME to 2K!!
"Probably a good ""bye"" at $5.00"
"$18 is where the illegal move began, so you might think it will stop there. But with all the leverage out there, this is going to single digits for sure. Still not a buy here at 59 even after almost 90 percent decline."
Waiting for $4 dollars a share then buy!
This stock is not wise investment. Nevertheless I just bought 500$ worth of it just for the fun and to support people involved in it. I see it as a going to casino and spend some money for entertainment :)
BFT is turning into PaySafe and IPOE is turning into SOFI. Both are going to go up HUGE. Next 2 digital currency. Easy the stock of future.
Germans like the stock!
Looking to squeeze your losses out of GME? Buy $GEL. 10% owned by JP Morgan with a 10% dividend. Low float low volume great investment - perfect for squeezing out higher values! March 19 $10 CALLS $0.15
Suckers pre-market to draw people in thinking another squeeze then the heavy shorting starts.
I will buy PORSCHE with GME spiking next week. Any predictions?
"Just ask yourself, ""is this a good, profitable company, worth $7billion with their debt?"" I would run from this."
"I bought more GME at 104.04, AAPL at 135.02 and AMZN at 3114.01 ...these 3 will pop due to AMAZON earnings after hours. ACCUMULATE ...smart money knows that. They will send GME high after hours. . I am buying these 3"
GME was $285 when I mention people should take profits and move to UAVS......just know UAVS is still available and will run higher
Read Mark Cuban's explanation why the stock has been falling and how he said to hold.
"I wonder how many GameStop customers got in on the hype and how many got hurt. Thats not so good for business......They really should have issued shares and raised enough to pay off all their debt. The CEO and CFO blew it for the company, but they certainly did great with their personnel accounts."
"#GME #AMC gonna need a # bail out the retail investor, banks, remember 2008, were back... now you save us... we like crowding together, since u have locked us in our homes for a year now..."
Free fall mode activated immediately apon markets open!
Small float and large short position means to the moon!!!! Flying today
Millennials just bought a bridge that doesn't exist.
Last one holding these falling shares be sure to turn the lights off when you are the last one out.
"You folks are playing a losing hand. Merrill Lynch has a one-year target for this at $10; CFRA has it at $9; Value line estimates its 3-5 year potential price at $4-$7. What else do you need to know? The business is dying. Try to think of this like a game like musical chairs. Let's go with ML's estimate and say a fair value is $10. So, you're going to have ten chairs in the end but even as I write this and the price has plummeted the past few days - it's still around $100. Ninety of those dollars aren't going to have a place to sit when the game's over. That's obviously not really how it works but those of you buying this obviously don't know what you're doing anyway and I thought that might make it a little easier to understand. Getting out at $100 will be a lot less painful than getting out at $10."
Up to 30 tomorrow
This drama will be over tomorrow. 40 open & 20 close.
"whoever thinks this isn't going to $200 is new to GME. hold til your target price is reached... in all likelihood, it will come around."
soon time to relax
Hedge fund will be exposed for paying bots to take over wall street bets and for paying journalists to write articles about silver. What millenial buys silver? Especially when Citadel and dump physical silver. No one. Yet it was in every article. This movie will be really good when it comes out.
I daresay 80% of GME holders have lost money
Shorts are getting boxed in. Looks like they buying.
I bought in at 328 double down on investment on dip got my average cost down to 140 with 35 shares total.
buy or sell or hold???
"Managed to buy in on Thursday at 75.00.. figured that was the resistance level of support.. blew right through that theory and as you all know ranked below 50.00.. held till this morning then took my exit at 86.50, made enough to buy one extra share... then bought back in at the low below my original buy in price.Not bad for trading such a volatile stock. Hopefully something exciting happens over the weekend. Good luck all"
If you lost on GME all hope is not lost. Take what you have and put it on NaKD.This is an even better opportunity then before 108% short positions on 2/4. If you create real movement and bring the hoard this stock will go parabolic!#getNaKD

SBE price had good momentum in November and Early December, between December and late January, the anticipated Merge date got postponed twice, a lot of the investors day traders got frustrated left and SHORTs piled in every time merge date got postponed. As of Feb 1st, SBE has 22% Short Volume. Now with a definitive SEC approved Merge Date for SBE to become ChargePoint (CHPT), it will be in the media spot light and Short Squeeze will be HUGE next week because SBE Charge Point unlike all other SPACs, it already had hundred million revenue and a EV dominant position in the massive EV charging station and at home charging industry just like $TSLA position to EV cars and $Abnb position to vacation hotel industry.$AMC $CLII $TPGY $BLNK $BBBY $NOK $FRSX $TQQQ"

"Anyone who knows what's really going on has sold and taken their profits already. You people encouraging others to hold or buy should of sold, don't try to take others down with you! Anyone that didn't know that this was going to end with a bunch of bag holders must be a newbie or just easily influenced by these conscienceless pumpers.I'm sorry people but the writing is on the wall, the GME fun is over! Don't hold all the way to the bottom due to some false sense of loyalty to the stick it to the hedge fund crowd! Most of them are out already. Sticking it to the hedge funds was awesome, but remember this about making money. This will be under $10 faster than it went to $500."

"Focus up, we need to hold strong and band together and we can stop greedy hedge funds like this from attacking our livelihoods"
This'll be in the 30s AH.

1 million share in AH. Volume is huge!!!
"Remember, volatility is the key, don't put all your money on one price, buy on the dips, couple shares here a couple shares there, always have some money available, you'll be okay, this is the red line in the sand, GameStop. Forget AMC, silver or whatever cheap stock out there, GameStop is it. This is the agreed upon battlefield stock to play with."
What do you think it’s going to happen on monday ? Is it Gonna be a dip and buy some more or it will explode ?
"so with all this attention on Gamestop, i wonder how many people will start buying online games from them now? Could all this hype actually materially affect the companies future earnings?? Could get very interesting for sure!!"

It’s not turn into a game of who gets left holding the bag
The bubble popped what is sad is that you will still hear people who lost it all saying not to sell at 11 bucks a share
My put options from 420 $ look really good. How low can it go?
"Thinking its time to sell. Going to keep pumping AMC, more potential. Reinvesting in HEMP (Hot for some reason but hearing BTCS and GAXY are good plays to. Make that squeeze!"
did the NYSE halt trading on gme this morning??
Wow! If you bought the dip you just about doubled your money. Amazing.
had to grab some more bagholders before dumping the rest lol
Shorts covering is not going away! Buy one share and hold
Closing strong today. AH will shoot up to $100. Then Monday $150.
He said 1000 $ https://twitter.com/trading_jesus/status/1356385247374401536?s=21
looks like a dip is coming... ready your buy orders.. little dip will result in giant climb...
What if the company issues more stock to fund an online operation? A lot more stock? Then what happens to us?
Take my money..shorties... thanks for the lesson... hold only if you can afford.. we still breathing and holding..
Reddit will come back strong. Hold and you’re safe. $1000 in no time.  will cry
Buying 100 shares tomorrow
In for 1000 shares
no halt on the way down..keep protecting big money
When the price dipped down on Thursday to roughly $120-130 I attempted to make an order on market and it tried to fill me in at $1500 per share....THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE HEDGE FUNDS WILL BE FORCED TO DO IF WE HOLD THE LINE! ITS ONLY A LOSS ONFE YOU SELL 
REPOST about AMC  Here I will lay it out for you......They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 20-30 if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here... COPY AND PASTE SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS
Question: Why you post in here while you do not own the stock. Answer: Because I am a dirty shortie who can not afford owning the stock. I just short it.
So is GME done? what's the deal?
"Stock gets artificially pumped by internet users telling people to buy which is not based on fundamentals at all, and now people are wondering what happened to the stock and why it’s gone and going down "
Robinhood Removes Limits on Shares of GameStop $GME and AMC Entertainment $AMC
"Blind faith will ruin you. Sorry for everyone who jumped in this at high numbers. If you're new to investing, please don't let this experience shape your view. There are plenty of opportunities in quality companies. Gamestop is not one of those quality companies. They have nothing unique about their business model and they have a brick & mortar presence weighing them down (it costs substantial capital to have physical stores). If you do stay, good luck."
"if you're looking for morale hype, this isn't the place to be. Too many salty mofos on this discussion board, go to WSB and read the latest top posts. Payday is coming, hold tight!"
It’s already going up $100++ today Buckle up
Wallstreet got the puts priced so high they dont move.... wallstreet=vegas
I didn’t borrow a cent and will be buying more today.
Will somebody GET THIS LIGHTS on the way out
"Just so you newbie's understand. People who are preaching to buy more are the very hedge fund managers who are setting you up. This company's fundamentals do not support even this price level. IT WILL GO TO A PRICE THAT REFLECTS FUNDEMENTALS. You can jump up and down, hold your breath, etc. doesn't matter. It may not happen tomorrow, but it will happen."
Short Squeeze Loss has NO LIMIT. You can loose everything you own.
"Here from China, Bought another 30 shares. Finally found way to participate."
I find it odd that Friday it closed at exactly $225Yesterday it closed at exactly $125And today it closes at exactly $90 
BUY MORE BIGGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE EVER DONT MISS THE TRAIN I PROMISE YOU
"42% up this is amazing , social media going nuts where is this going to end today,beho knows imo 150 - 200 is not out of the question WOW"
"It is pointless to sell at this point. It is pointless to resist the power of the Reddit Universe, an intergalactic revolt against the evil establishment"
"WS protecting shorts and hedge will do all it can to prevent from going to high, plain to see"
"If you think Gamestop is a good buy when it's worth 6b, you should check out $GNPX. They may be sitting on a cure for diabetes and have a lung cancer drug with fast track status and they are only being valued by Wall Street at 200m."
Someone you don't No on the internet says to buy a bankrupt stock. What do you do? 
It’s going to 18-30 then 1000+. Look at the charts from the Volkswagen squeeze in 2008. It didn’t really happen fully yet and that is why people are saying to hold
"In the end, Gamestop is still up 840%...That's awesome !!"
Cut your losses shorts. HF played you!
"Looks like a down day- no short squeeze today or tomorrow imo. I am not sorry for this who didn’t sell above 3 or 4 hundred, but the ones duped into catching a falling knife and are now way underwater. It’s a shame"
So 1-1 week each now.. Lets finish this next week... either we go up or down to start...HOLD..
I keep hearing bankruptcy when is this supposed to happen
"See you back at $20...LMAO....eventually the hyped and overvalued SP will comes back to earth. In the short run, anything goes if there is an imbalance of supply/demand. In the long run, investing is not a game..."
This is how it will end. GameStop will raise billions in new capital via new share issue at ‘ market price’ say $100 and 5year convertible bond @ 150. Shorts will have last chance and be forced to cover by competing with long whales  to take up this issue. Capping losses at $80/share
"watch, Elon will buy shares at the end of the day and then Tweet about ""gaming"" or something and it'll go up 60%."
If the squeeze doesn't go the way all other squeezes similar this it can mean only one thing.1. Wallstreet is ONLY for the rich and retail investors are only needed for their 401(k)s. Democrats and Republicans will become a thing of the past because this will unite American citizens regardless of their political beliefs. Maxine Waters is talking about an investigation is needed. #$%$ investigations are a political maneuver to suppress the discussion. This is the reason we need to HOLD the line. This needs to play out. It may change our govt and wallstreet both. This could be historic!
Now I won’t have to save up for my kids college for 30 years
The game is back!
My portfolio of index funds returned $25k today...Too bad maybe GME took another 42% bath today....lol.
I bought 200 shares at $400. I have faith this will be 800 soon. I’m holding.
I told you Robinhood and Reddit people not to cry when you lost and claim the market was manipulated and the market is rigged.So you say the market is manipulated only when it goes against you right?
The only way we make money is if we all HOLD!!!!!!
"hold y'all, these dudes are still out billions at this price. its far from over, the match has just started and they are making their moves. all you have to do is sit back and watch them fail or slip up and get caught."
I wanna be a paid troll too. Where to send my application?

we are left holding the bag along with two destroyed hedge funds who often revealed wall street malpractices. The winners: Blackrock along with the strongest wall street firms and of course elon musk and its stock promoters.

Next Week Tuesday is the big day with the short Report!!
Going to 20 tomorrow.
Don’t fall for it. Sell at the highs! They’re counting on you to chase it up so they can short it!!
I put my entire pension and kids college funds in GME when it was over $400. Everyone was saying it was going over a $1000 maybe even $2000. How do I tell my wife and kids? How is my wife gonna react?
"So much pressure to sell lolMedia, bots, hedgies, random dude.Meanwhile redditors chilling.Naah, I’ll just hold!"
Amazing

One question. Why are we celebrating +15%?
Bag holders.....
Do you see it yet? You could have sold near $80 this morning but you chased it up...the hedge funds knew the inexperienced Robinhood kids would do it. It’s been shorted all afternoon and will close below $50. Sell. Get out. Invest in $OXY $GEL $XLE $ET make some money back.
Candle stick pattern is almost complete....you revolutionaries better take some money back while you can lol
BACK TO $300 BOYS N GIRLS!
When you tell your cat you bought 1 share of GME stock instead of cat food
Hey do any of you actually own computers? Because GameStop quite literally has no entry into the e commerce world.
"To those who lost big on this one: Don't jump, life is precious and you can always recover from this. You will."
No shorting allowed on GME. Buy buy buy !!! SEC stopped shorting !!!
Be very careful shorting is not allowed today they might start shorting ladder on Monday
Hey am I too late to get in on this GameStop thing?? I heard about this from the news
Who is thinking this will go back to 300?
"I see it climbing up, what’s going on hedgies feeling the squeeze again, are your puts in trouble too"
"The self proclaimed “Wolf of Wall Street,” Jordan Belfort, expects the Robinhood trading platform to go out of business over the GameStop (GME) trading controversy. “I really believe the lawsuits are going to be very problematic,” Belfort told Yahoo Finance Live."

"Halting it again... good sign: hedge funds are holding it... they are still shorting it, that means we can squeeze them again"
Trying to rally but no.
"Let me ask a question There are a lot of people that lost money, so they want to make back their losses. There are a lot of people that missed the first ride, and they want in on the next one. There are a lot of people that made a lot off the initial ride, now they can ride the 2nd one. Plus, we have not heard what the company is going to to, like Cramer said.What do you think of all of that?"
2 min silence for those kids who bought GME at 350 +
"If you want to really hit shorts where it hurts check out $GERN Shorts have kept $GERN down for many years, but there now is a short squeeze on it's way. This drug combats cancer, is in two phase 3 trials with an incredible disease modifying drug called imetelstat. Shorts are trying to keep this drug from the public by suppressing the share price. This drug will save many lives, be part of this revolution as we all have lost someone close to cancer. Thank you all."
"100% GME, AMAZON, AAPLE will pop tomorrow. AMZN beat 100% ESP growth Q4. That's true. All games they sold , has the same pattern for Game stop stores sales. APPLE looks cheap like GME. APPL will break 150 breakout. GME should benefit to above 140 in the near time. Load up Load up."
I am terrified as to what i’ll do now when i lost all my savings. I never invested in speculative stocks but first time this hype got to me and i thought maybe this is lifetime opportunity and went all in!
nothing but red candles from here till 4 EST
I am here for the squeeze holding
"40 % from open, amazing"
Extremely good opportunity Load or hold on your GME shares Tomorrow >>> $300++Good luck
JP MORGAN owns 10% of $GEL. Great company highly profitable with a 10% dividend! Drop GME and make your money back with the March 19 $10 CALLS for $0.15. Stock is $7 and up 6% today!
Hungary is still holding
"Sorry, GME is a meme stock headed to $10. Anyone who is telling u otherwise is lying or dillusional."
"It’s obvious this stock price was going back down due to limited buying of shares. Hedge funds came in like the elite that run the world and showed everybody they can bend the rules to their favor. As the hedge funds was with the shenanigans on this stock and AMC, Smart investors made so much money off put options knowing they wanted this and AMC to bleed. Use your logical brains or be emotionally victimized"
"Just load up, be patiebt and you will have yor money "
To DA moooon!!
"Whatever it was worth prior to the reddit hype is not what it is worth now. The old-heads stubbornly refuse to realize this, and keep holding to a pre-jan price. $GME got free PR, and is in the news daily around the world."
when does the short covering start?
tomorrow instead of moon you guys touch the earth
Whos feeling the squeeze now
"I lost my dog, house and my wife (thank God) after I bet on GameStop. What will I ever do? Help!!!"
"Kind of interesting the way it falls to exactly 90$ at close. Down exactly 60%, down exactly 135$. That never happens with other stocks, just sayin"
Millenials lose again.
$68 has to hold.!!
"WSB users: Robinhood agreement (Dec, 2020): ""I understand Robinhood may at any time, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Me, prohibit or restrict My ability to trade securities."""
next price target -60%
I want all to know that I’m HOLDING MY SHARES and the reason is because I can afford to do so and also I believe that once retail is allowed to fully BUY $GME and AMC again the stocks will surge. The short interest is still high in these names. So the fundamentals of the trade has not changed in my view. If the fundamentals of the trade had changed then I would be selling but that is why I’ve not sold.
Friends of Robinhood bought cover before he lifted the buy restrictions to its clients.
It’s a good time to triple up my GME!!!
$GME and $AMC charts are still exact copies today. No way this is an organic coincidence without meddling...
BUY AND HOLD GME!! WILL BE $100 Monday
"Hope people learned something from this.The squeeze was last week, I told a lot of folks that & was laughed at by a lot of them."
Do not sell hold and buy we can hike the price keep buying
@TysonianSaganist You're correct. Fundamentals put this thing at $10 tops.
"I’ve been trying to buy stock in GME to support this meme movement. Anyway... may have messed up my ticker symbol, I’ve been buying GM instead. The good thing is they aren’t going out of business."
"GME is still shorted way above 100%, strong bullish. The amount of shills/bots in this chat speaks for itself, the same goes for the pre/post-market manipulation and the short-ladder-attacks. The hedgefunds are getting desperate. Their shorts cost them billions of dollars each day, they'll have to cover sooner or later, google ""volkswagen short squeeze"". See you at $3000 "
All I need is $364 to break even. We can do it!
"We told you the CITADEL played yall like a flute, they hold the largest short position on $BB and $GME so they had the media pump silver because they’re the fifth largest holder so it helped balance it off... get some revenge buy $BB and hold... it’s a safe, smart and great way to stock it to them for playing you"
"People if shorts are out of their position, there is no short squeeze. If you hold because you think so then well you are throwing money away. If you have any hint of positive news like earnings or new money coming in to name a couple then hold. I think the market has answered that for you"
$185 tomorrow
"If you buy this below $500, you got a grand deal"
BUY AMC
Hmmmmm...  maybe the government shouldn’t give any more stimulus checks to people who bought $GME or $AMC. This is what happens.
I know price keeps dipping but someone explain why I’m still holding and I can’t stop buying???? The dips get juicier and juicer
The game stopped and you lost.
where are all the diamond hands posts? What a gimmick lasted a week
tomorrow another 50% discount at the least! Most likely $18 by closing. Blood bath. Load up on preparationH
HOLD ON...THIS PONY IS WILD!
"“People don’t buy stock; it gets sold to them. Don’t ever forget that.”― Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street"
"Guys, anyone here exercised their options last friday? Did they settle the trades? Did you get your shares?"
If you can't read a balance sheet you should not be investing. If you read the GME balance sheet you would not have any money in this company. It really is that simple...
"76 million volume. I'm not leaving. Keep shorting and buying, I don't care. Volatility and volume is the name of the game. Thank you redditors for making GME a battlefield like in a video game."
Too late. This one is going to $20 wish Robinhood had released restrictions earlier.
Call Gamestop headquarters tell them how you were duped into buy the stock and they may give you some of your money back.
It's hard to believe that people paid 100-483 for this expecting to make money
Super Bowl commercial will finish the original short!
"closed at 92.41. Longs just went to bed, evil never sleeps in their losing game. They like to stay up late digging their hole deeper and deeper. Good night fellow longs will see ya tomorrow."
"Mark Cuban said GME worth $50B because they will soon have $2B ecommerce sale and there are bunch of company worth 25 time. So at level playing this can easily $50B company in 1 year.So don't listen, if you support that by buying stock and exclusively buy game and game console and other stuff from them, this will sure happen. Might even worth $100B."
"Guys look at the money pouring into this, fascinating to watch ,"
come on bulls push her to $75 for a new post say high top and force the shorts to cut their losses.
enjoy your weekend just wait next Monday you'll wake up and it will be a 5.00 footlong I mean stock.
Short interest is still at 88.58% BUY and HOLD!!! Do not believe bots or media!!!
Holding! 
"I'm sure this post will incite the juveniles to post more stupid and annoying GIFS but here goes anyway: Your GIFS make it difficult to read any of the message board posts.

I get that you find your GIFS fun and amusing and that they are the ""new"" format like emojis in text messages.

To the mooon buy more on the opening and u r going to gain
Anyone still holding should’ve sold last week
Now Robinhood account holders can buy all you want and ride them to zero if you choose.
"After reading this board and the number of fake negativity to scare us off, my conclusion:""With 23k AMC shares on-hand even in the red, I'm 110% very confident and supporting the HOLDING cause, I wish you all a great weekend, time to Logoff - see you Monday""$AMC LONG and STRONG!!$AMC $GME $NOK"
"GME is in full reverse like a ship captain trying to avoid an iceberg. Fundamentally, GME is simply not worth its current price so the holders are selling. This is not manipulation - the manipulation was driving it to over $400. Today we are seeing the result of being lied to so GME holders are selling to prevent further losses. This is not short selling - it's simply selling an insanely over inflated stock!"
"There seems to be so much confusion about short selling and short interest.1. Short selling in its nature is basically margin betting. It is the borrowing of shares from longs without the longs knowing. 2. Brokerages are the mechanism through which shorting happens. They set a margin for the borrower for each stock. The margin is what the hedgefunds are scared of not interest, they can afford the interest, the margin can kill them, also stopping their ability to play other stocks. The more margined they get, the quicker they need to get out of the trade.3. Current short interest is unknowable, by no one, period. All the numbers being thrown around are wrong. Short sells are reported on a regular basis to the SEC, the SEC publishes them, each fund reports their own numbers but individuals traders don't have to. So even that number is not accurate.4. The companies that claim to give you short data are fos, it is just what they compile from a few reports and their best guess, it's meaningless, especially in a nked short. Do not waste your money on it.5. If the current short interest was live, the market would break. There would be no point in shorting. 6. Currently, the Bberg terminal shows a short interest of 89%. But again, that is their calculation and best guess through their algorithm of what happened volume/time since the lest report. It is not accurate. 7. In a nked short, most of these calculations and guesses also go out the window. At this point, all we know is that the stock was heavily shorted through ladders at the first half of the week, it is obvious in the chart so there is a possibility that the shorts have doubled down, its a common strategy they use.8. If they doubled down, it explains why the price ran so low, this gives them an opportunity to cover their current short and some of their original short in hopes of bringing down the magnitude of the inevitable squeeze."
"Hey u Blind CoCkrouches read wellHedge Funds are still shorting like crazy!The biggest hedge fund shorts of $GME and $AMC, per fintel.io:Per SEC filing on 2/2, Hedge Fund Simplex Trading, Llc had a short position of 1.997 million $AMC shares, and 9,421 put(short) options(Each option is 100 shares), representing a 27.85% and a 183.94% increase respectively compared to their previous position. That's equivalent to shorting around 3 million $AMC shares.Simplex Trading, Llc also had 4.847 million shares of $GME short position, and 2,547 put(short) options, roughly equivalent to 5.1 million $GME shares short.On 2/4(yesterday):$GME: Among 62,213,000 market volume, 46% were shorted$AMC: Among 162,147,400 market volume, 55% were shortedPlease upvote to let this post stick!"
Bought a load at 80's.. THANKYOUUUU ALL
"Lmao at the bag holders who bought over 300, 200, 100 ooo money will be lost - this will settle back where it belongs at $20, what a show"
"Revoluts' 3rd party broker just disabled buying function for $GME and $AMC, hold your positions buy wherever you can. they are trying their best to regain contol!"
Buying on the way down is a great strategy if you want to go bankrupt.
"Still a lot of doubt on this board, it'll be interesting to see where things end up. It appears this is becoming larger than all of us."
"This is going back where it belongs, if you bought at $400 you want your head testing "
Short squeeze is over. Short interest fell from 140% to 53%. becareful of falling knives
"FIRST STOP @ 17, SECOND STOP @ 5 , major support @ 4 THEN I'LL BUY BACK 5000 SHARES "

"WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WOULD COMMENT ON A STOCK BOARD NEGATIVELY IF THEY DONT HAVE ANY MONEY INVOLVED?!!? ITS OBVIOUS THE BEARS ARE SCARED AND TRYNA MAKE NOISE TO SCARE YOU AWAY. SOME OF THESE ACCOUNTS SPEND EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY TRYING TO TALK DOWN ON GME, HOW SADDD. THEY ALREADY LOST MENTALLY EVEN IF THEYRE IN PROFIT STILL. BEST TO COVER NOW WHILE ITS STILL AFFORDABLE"
I love this stock. Buy low sell high everyday.
Media spending an awful lot of time and energy trying to push GME down. Why are they doing that? Is somebody telling them to do that?
"Faak Reddit nerds and conmen. Just let Inovio make it on its merits. I have time and I believe in Science. Would not have gotten the shot and certainly would have not persuaded my wife to get INO-4800 unless I believed in the Science behind Inovio. Even if the stock crashes again, I am thankful for the opportinity to learn about Inovio and to be among the first in line for a real vaccine that really works. $INO $GME"
OMG!! We are flying!!! Didn't we all wished we have bought at the 6.6.$ dip?Mark my words. 10$ today.If you are still HOLDIG you are a Diamond guy.1B$ of Short to be covered imminently.$AMC $GME $NOK
"I built about $5million in net worth through hard work, calculated risk controlled investments in a basket of index funds over the course of 15 years. Contrary to popular believe. 95% of these get rich schemes like GME results in 1% winning and the remaining 99% being worse off financially then when they went into this ponzi scheme. Face it GME longs, you got totally punked by smart money that have long exited and laughing all the way to the bank...."
Honestly the best time to buy it! If everyone just bought 1 share even we could clap these hedges cheeks xD
Buy Buy Buy Only way to make this go up again. Buy Buy Buy get that lost money back.
Bought at open 145. 14.5k in. Took all my wife money in our joint acct savings. Hope she doesn’t notice.
"Wow into the $50's, hope you all sold in the $400's like I did "
Can not believe people still blame “manipulation”.
Hold the bag until the Name is ubiquitous with online retail
Just picked up some trendies to watch the  
"A lot of comments in here are saying sell, sell, sell. It will go down. Well, If you sold yours and don't have any shares. Why do you care and even comment on GME?? Unless you are not a short!!!"
Lets get going to 120$ first... LETS GOOOOOOO
$GME is going up.... what about $PHUN>?
The shorts right now who shorted from 450
Are people really still buying this?? The squeeze is done....back to reality
"who's still holding?? diamond hand here, baby!"
GME to the moon
The only thing you should be buying is Puts...mine did very well today and there is still plenty of room to go!
Craig I beg you if your at the point you have to wait for a chq to invest your strategy is dangerous. Take more long term fundemental position and dollar cost average then. You are trying to get short term rich rather then long term wealthy.
Still a great short.
Banging your head against the wall isn't going to get rid of your headache. Just like buying more of this at 70 like you know you did.

I’m in! I’m so excited to be part of what will be the most historic short squeeze ever! $1000 a share in the next couple of weeks 
Today we show how much we like the stock
The one that tells you to hold is the one that is the first one to bail out. Please Please get out before it hit $50 then $30. Head Fund are making a killing with the help of Robbinghood and your very own broker.
I think you guys need to go look at a Volkswagen chart. in 2008 there was a nice squeeze. it always gives it all back.
Over 70 today boys
$GME right now
Let’s create another Squeeze!!!!
HELP! I bought at $350 thinking it'll go to $1 million like they promised it would. I sold at $80 the other day and I bought more at $110 premarket but now it's at $95. It's my grandma's money. WHAT DO I DO?
"I tried to sell a call on the 100 shares I own to make up for some losses, and TDAmeritrade wont allow me to sell covered calls on GME. 'Ordered Rejected: Underlying is a hard to borrow stock.' I would argue that I should be able to sell OTM calls on shares I OWN, but nonetheless, there seems to be a shortage of shares to borrow"
ut oh... steady climb up to $200... wait for the squeeze bros... it's going to start coming in $5/ $10 chunks.
"""diamond hands""!"
Simple...just hold!
"you baggies still havent learned. Look at AMC/GME/BB daily chart and similarities... tell me that is not a manipulation by the institutional investors. Accept your losses and just move on. This stock is too dangerous for retailers...unless, of course, if you want to gamble lol"
Run baby run
With firms limiting retail orders going forward. Can something like this still happen in the future? This was another good example of how Wall Street and the hedge funds take down the retail investors sadly.
"Hedge funds are desperately pressing the price down by selling off their stakes in ""good"" companies like $AMZN, $AAPL to cover their losses. I am buying these as well LOL."
OPENS TOMORROW AT $50. Your last chance for $90!!
Can anyone advise what happened with the short spike in price last night?
"Here is from their holiday Net sales were $1.770 billion, a 3.1% decrease compared to 2019, as strong console demand was offset by store closures under the Company’s planned de-densification strategy, temporary store closures mandated by local governments due to COVID-19, and industry-wide limited supply of new gaming consoles, and supply chain constraints broadly;E-Commerce sales, which are included in comparable store sales, rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective;Also Australia/New Zealand, where the Company’s operations were materially less impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, total comparable sales for the nine-week period increased approximately 31%, outperforming the Company’s other operating regions.So business anything but dead. I think it coming back very strongly. Now if wallstreet give parity to other eCommerce company with $1.35B sale and assume just 50% growth ( they have 309%), it would trade atleast 20 time revenue = $27b which is above all time high they just have.Let's assume it's only 20% sustain eCommerce growth, it would still trade 7-8 time revenue which is $10B+"
"every time it halted, it went up higher.. so halt all you can..lol"
"This is a great day trade. Play the volatility.For those who are calling this a great investment and holding long, you'll lose big time. No matter what you call this, it's a classic pump and dump and in spite of the volatility it's definitely overall being dumped. If you're lucky enough to get shorts on the spikes then good on you. If it dips really fast buy and sell the rebounds. I'm mostly pretty bearish on this stock. Go to a GameStop store and have a good look at it, then see if that's where you want your money. GLTY."
"If you're still holding GME, don't sell, the worst has passed. Now it's valued like they will grow in the online sector, no more."
Halt#3– so corrupt they don’t halt it when it’s going down only up that should tell you something
Hedge fund look like now new too big to fail after SEC and other govt agency look into what happen if they restricted.They are part of reason overall market move higher. Very concerning because our retirement money park in market index mainly.This sell off is unexpected and ruthless to suppress this movement.
"Ironic for the Hedge Funds that may have gotten squeezed as GME went to $300, $350 and $400. Surely there was thousands of investors who Sold Short at those inflated prices - now those folks and making $200+ bucks a share in a week's time"
halted again? Is this helping? Probably creates more panic and therefore more volatility.
WSB diehard poster (RagingKitty) hit $48 million at the top but didn't sell a share. At the open tomorrow his account will be worth @$3.6 Million. If he had just sold half his shares he'd be living on the beach in Malibu. The man doesn't understand the madness of crowds obviously. Or tulips for that matter.
$AMC $GME $NAKDi love the convenience of investing in these 3 stocks and having to use only one graph.. KUDOS!!
Who was Smart and sold at $400++????
"All the people who are holding $GME stock will be able to hand it down the generations and say ""I was there!"""
Why are people saying move on. The stock still shorted near 70 percent. You all moving to stocks shorting less than 10 percent to pump abs leave. That’s the issue you all leaving with paper hands. Either néw retail will come in or another hedge fund to hurt and other hedge fund.
DON'T GIVE UP - THEY GAVE US A DISCOUNT! :-p
Haven’t recall seeing this many viewers in the message board since the great days of NIO. NIO will come back!
HOLD
"My realistic thinking on this - hedge fund shorts are largely out. Current shorts are (mostly) medium to large retail who had big boy brokers. That said - short interest is still way over 100%.Longs are really longs and will keep holding on no margin. Shorts are paying interest and looking for a quick buck. Shorts will gradually realize that longs are all stupid and proud to be stupid, rather than investors, and the shorts will gradually get tired and move on, realizing there is easier money to be made.This creates a gradual upward pressure until you have the next big announcement which will either bring lots more shorts or lots more longs to get this going one way or another - very quickly."

Bought 50 shares let s see how ut goes up
GME will never go to $1000! No one in his right mind would pay that for a $10 stock. That would be reckless and irresponsible!
All the GME restriction news for today so far:Robinhood increases GME shares limit from 100 to 500Robinhood allows buying of fractional shares for GMET212 removed all of its GME restrictions.Revolut allows buying GME againDriveWealth lifted it's GME buy restrictions
 Just really like the stock
dear robinhood how come you didn't stop sell order and only allow buy orders today as the stock sunk???
"Mr. Roaring Kitty needs to stop posting - anywhere - and hire an attorney. He may not have ""expected"" the community to embrace his posts so enthusiastically, but his posts will point to a motive for manipulation."
Hedge funds are making a lot of money because you people don't know how to invest.
"Reviewing news and charts, all I can see is further price drop- change my mind."
There are unconfirmed reports that someone went to the mall and actually bought a video game at a gamestop location yesterday
The anticipation is growing. 36? 38? Where will we be midday?
"Every day, I am adding, I like this Stock!!"
"remember, nobody in the world has your best interests at heart the way YOU do. as such, if someone is telling you to sell, it's for a reason - and it's not the kindness of their heart for an internet stranger. if this were over, everyone would have moved on. instead we see the media linger with this constant bombardment of fear uncertainty doubt, message boards flooded overnight with ""SELL SELL SELL"", and it doesn't add up. it doesn't add up because its an exact reproduction of the short bashers spam we all have seen on EVERY SINGLE STOCK BOARD, only on an absolutely gargantuan scale. the massive spreading of FUD combined with the sudden influx of bearish posters across social media everywhere is massively suspicious imo. I will continue to hold. reason: I like this stock. this is not financial advice, Im gonna go eat crayons now."
We will never sell
Robinhood lifts restrictions on GME!!!!! Back to the moon we go!!!! It’s gonna be a buying frenzy!!! Bwwwwaaaaahhhh
Confucius once said: man who buy GameStop get Gamed and Stopped
", AMC is the play now..... GME is to expensive. AMC options expire Friday and will squeeze the stock to the moon. It’s cheap and we can impact more because we can buy more shares. Go AMC."

The silver lining for longs is that you can't lose another 135 points tomorrow.
lets take it to 169
After hours will be huge!!!!!
Still a long way back to $4!
it still has a huge potential
You guys just keep holding yall are doing great.

I have done my part and placed a sell order at 550$/Share. Do you part too. GME to the moon guys.

we've all been duped at timeswallstreet bro's duped the robinhooders
7mins halt????
Shorts dont covered already
"still holding onto hope that I will get my money back. I sold my car and my phone and my PS5 to buy GME because Redditors told me it is for a good cause, and I'm actually doing something good. if I lose the money I will have nothing left. can't pay my credit card bill this month after taking out the max amount on cash advances. please hold and don't sell! I promise you I won't sell either! I promise!"
Not just me lot of people on tweet asking Elon Musk to buy if he really support movement. Search @elonmusk gmeSearcher tweeter. It's slowly making people realize what Elon Musk doing.Why those manipulator not scared unless they know Elon totally under control and won't show support further even when that is in his best interest.
barely any volume. they waiting for us to make moves on each other. got some diamond handed magnificent bestards in here
Why do people care if i hold? Why do they care if I lose money? Mind your own business. I have a plan and you don’t need to know it. I DONT CARE IF I LOSE MONEY. IM HOLDING BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
an excellent buying opportunity
Never knew I will have this opportunity to buy gme again get ready for the 200$ gain again
In the end the hedge funds will always find a way to win.
I bought GME at 483 still holding my entire life's savings in it
how many priceless shares should I buy at this price... answer... all of them.
So many  in this chat. Should we leave you guys to do what  do?
"$GM, $TSLA, $NIO, $GME, $AMC, $F - We need to welcome the Reddit people to the GM board!"
Funny how this is still down 100 from yesterday and you guys are so happy 
Hedge fund trust funds too big to fail
"Stay strong and firm. Here is the good news. The Hedge funds are manipulating the price and hoping to cause a panic but the sale of shares of the individual investors are too small for them to pick up. The prices are dropping but the different individual investors are buying it up. so no matter how low the price goes, we are still the ones picking it up. They will come a day of reckoning in next 3 weeks. We just need to hold. The tide will swing for the better.  and shares are ."
Look at the charts for $GME and $AMC. They are identical. Hmmm.. 
"now 2021-02-05 17:23:56.706 80,000 Short Shares Availabilityshorts your algorithm is outdated"
catch the trend 
The Ship is Sinking!!!!
I've gone to Gamestop many times. To either use their bathrooms or to get out of the rain. Never to buy a game though.
Pump $AMC while this is halted!
everything's fine
Is ANYONE paying attention to this? https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520312805/d67321d424b5.htm#supprom67321_4
$AMC $GME trading nearly identical with chart patterns on the volume weighted average prices
The story tonight is Robinhood removing all restrictions on trading GME. You know plenty of people sold for a huge profit over $300.. and they know it will be even easier to run it up this time. New short = nervous short. Bounce is tomorrow.
"From the technical standpoint...if you want to go long you need to start buying around now...and buy more if it dips a bit lower...I don't know how low shorts will be able to take it down but certainly not under $47. 1x revenue of $5.62 billion makes it $80 a fair value without any growth discounted. Once it finds a bottom and start ascending again, you should take profit between $80 and $100. Again after that it all depends on the momentum, fundamentals and valuation.Good luck to everyone!"
Well that whole ordeal was fun.i only lost $1000 and bought in at 150 last week.Next time I feel the urge to gamble I’ll do it with online slots
You guys are being bombarded by the MINSTER OF PROGAGNDA.. JOSEPH GOEBBELS of Wall Street.
no one sell
Where were all the bears when people were making $$$$ and sold. Lots of money was made in this stock.
GME bag holders be like..
"Attention, Robinhood is going to allow you to buy 500 shares tomorrow according to FXHedge on Twitter"
"”The volume is low”.What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.So, stop panicking. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, dam have breakfast if you haven’t already. oh and HOLD."
"If this rises dramatically in AH, that's shorts covering. $amc $gme"
"Dear everybody, there is no more short squeeze. It is never going back above whatever it was trading in early January. The hedge funds are not manipulating you or using ladder attacks (or whatever buzzword you heard). The short sellers are not using bots to spam the forums and create fear to get you to sell. Just get out and reinvest whatever remains into something sensible like SPY, or QQQ. Most day traders lose money."
Go to moon GME 
"1pm eastern timing. We r buying 1 share each, coordinated attack on shorts n HF today. Whose in. Ps: we r doing this in AMC"
more than 100 milion shares short 14th februari new data from S3 partner will be released. The short false shares will be discovered soon. after that we will rocket to mars with Elon Musk as the capten
"Based on some people’s logic, retailers should hold, and buy more shares. Who sell you the shares then? Blackrock!"
buy after the dip at opening
So who lost lots of money?!
millennials say...
"On January 28, I posted that the squeeze was over. I got 38 thumbs down, and only 2 smart people gave a thumbs up. I don't even short, but it was quite obvious that shorts closed out their positions, and new short positions were being made. I also stated in the same post the GME would go back to 20 - 40 bucks. Yet, I have to hand it to you people. You have huge bal,z to watch your money dissipate for a cause. Not for me! GLA ^..^"
HOLD like the HALT
I had sooo much fun today that I'll need to sleep in tomorrow....it's a Boomer thing. Be smart Hooders as I won't be here to guide you. You might want to have a long discussion concerning your cognitive abilities with a professional.
"Lucy and the football again. They're selling the 100 calls to the unwary @$11.50. This means, in effect, they can buy the stock at $83 and sell it to you for $111.50."
"Diamond hands are putting up a fight, but the end is still the same"
Bag holders that bought over $300 right now
Looks like it is only bagholders in this now trying to lure new bagholder on which to unload.
I bought at $420 to help the cause! What should I do now?
Rh really pulled a communist move. I feel sorry for you lads
I have a feeling something interesting is going to happen @ 3:30.
Looks like SQ will continue on Monday and again Friday before options expire. Those who held have 50/50 chances of winning or losing
"Checking in on my GME crowd from over at AMC. Hold strong, brothers and sisters!"
"Been working in the industry for 38 years. Still don't understand what a ""Diamond Hand"" is. Is it something you get at a club? A pin you get when you lost all your money?Please explain."
trying to catch stop-losses again....
"Nobody is late getting in at this price, this is still the ground floor on this stock. Buy hold and push this baby to the moon. Look if the stock rallied like this on no news, look what it's going to do on the approval news. OCGN LONG and STRONG, Like it much better than $GME or $BB"
Back to 15.00 a share we go.
DO NOT SELL. We can take this over $1000. No joke! DIAMOND HAND THIS!
"I hate to say I told you so, and I was honestly trying to help some of the actual serious longs on here. But they were all resistant to the facts.I hope you've all learned a valuable lesson."
The longs squeezed the shorts once. No reason it couldn't be done again.
"GME taught a bunch of Rookie Investors a lesson.. the ones that ""Held"" instead of cashing out like that Texas Teenager.It would have been cheaper to visit your library and check out books related to finance and stock markets."
The lower it goes the more we buy
this whole was organised to make amateurs money. unfortunately all the experienced investor sold at 400 and the amateurs are holding the bad :(
$AMC going to 300% today buy in now
I'm considering going back in
When you’re in so much debt it’s time to change your identity.
"according to Bloomberg, the short came down from 114% to 40% as of yesterday. So now the stock is traded among retail players. Not expect much movement."
Going back up because the FED does not want you to have losses a tax time.
"Millions of dollars spent on this weeks $50 weekly puts at the open , All gonna get wiped out in 45 mins."
Yes $150 now. We back
500$ Monday open
"Remember guys shorts have no clue abt gme long term and mid term, they just see a stock that’s easy to short, but the squeeze will come at them hard hopefully shorts are taking profits before Monday"
Robinhood is the best broker! Thank you robinhood for stealing from the poor! Team short!
Avg down all the way to $75. Whose with me?
People were telling others to be bag holders with them and a lot of people listened!
keep buying a few shares and HOLD!
It’s our turn now
"People that can't see why gamestop is so valuable probably also think $tsla is so valuable because they sell cards, see the future folks!"
Only reason To Robinhood lifted the restrictions is because so many people transferred to another platform and they lost a ton of money. now those people who transferred have the ability to buy back in. this thing going right back up might not be the same levels as before but it rising again
"Still holding strong, managed to add both AMC and $GME. F to the bashers, hedge funds and the media"
HOLD HOLD>>>

"GME was a Ponzi scheme and now it's ending. But there's a bigger question. Is the capitalistic system that we all live under, also a Ponzi scheme?"
Will be closing $10 tomorrow
After market this will boost back to 400 big news coming
did it halt?
Only those whose hands are diamond and true will weather the storm on the way to crushing the shorts!

"Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop’s short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year."
"150 , this no physical stores. It is a futuristic online GameStop "
"People that said ""I will hold no matter what happen"". Well, you have no choice because you bought high and you're hoping the stock will go back up."
no ladder stepping today?
$AMC $GME  Hold more AMC THO 
"Hey Siri, should I buy a $10 stock for $100?"
"Be greedy when others are fearful! This stock is still shorted with the media claiming its not, hedge funds bought at 20$ not 50$, stay logical my friends."
"I just Read this:However, some of the most enthusiastic gamers (the ones who play so many hours that they get bored of games quickly) would rather have a physical copy. Why? That's because when they are finished playing a game they can sell it, or trade with friends -- an option not available to them with a digital copy. Catering to this crowd, GameStop offers trade-ins and used games for purchase. This allows hardcore gamers an opportunity to recoup some of their purchase price for video games, and allows others the option to buy used games at prices discounted from the retail versions. At the moment, digital games typically sell for the same retail price as their physical counterparts. For game enthusiasts, the physical copy is still the better option, and therein lies the undeniable advantage that GameStop currently has."
"I have no interest in this, but longs should get out ASAP. This is going to nothing over time. Take something before you get nothing."
3 Billion valuation then SLS at $300.Great valuation now to buy to hit the target. It won't be diffust.Look $GME or $NVAX
Bailed out trust funders lives matter!
You think the rally is over ? It just started
The transfer of wealth in real time.Stimulus checks go to the wealthiest as recipients hand over the cash to Wall Street intelligence.Isn't income inequality wonderful?
Still don’t understand how a game store with carpet and loose games can land itself on a moon
where u at shorties? lmao
"Hey, shorties, and shills, tell me a scary story...I'm in the mood for one!"
At what price is GME an irresistible short? Based on any reasonable fundamental analysis I can’t see it as a compelling buy at the moment. Still it may be great for short term speciation but that’s not my style.
I was a part of the mania. I was young and didn't know better. I bought at 325. I help. Everyone kept saying HOLD. I did. I still have the shares hahaha
into the 40's by 8
Gamestop stores are all empty and they lost $1 in 2019. But paying $63 ok.. LMAO
"You know what they say, diamonds are made under pressure  everybody"
Check out r/wallstreetbets for some true holders and motivation. A lot of scared people in here. WE HOLD! 
"THIS IS AN EXACT REPEAT OF VOLKSWAGAN IN 2008. SAME CHART, EXCEPT MORE SHORTS AND WAY MORE PPL TRADING IN THE MARKET. SHORTS R DONE"
"People didn't take profits at 480. People bought this at 400. Imagine using reddit literally ever. I can't even, sir"
If your still buying this stock .. pls just donate your money to a shelter instead of wasting it
$30 dollars tomorrow
Anyone got in at 480?
Here is the next Game Stop play. It is MJLB!!!!! This stock is going through the roof. I bought it at .006 her share and now it's at $0.06!! It's going to $2 very soon!!
"Please for the love of God, do not fall for this pre market bull trap just like yesterday! This ""rally"" is said to be due to RH lifting its restriction but it is all a ploy for you to lose more money. The SEC as GME on a short selling restriction list which prevents short selling if it is lower than the previous closing price but allow them to short sell on an uptick as we are seeing pre market. Do not be fooled that this uptick is from RH or WSB, its just the hedge fund short sellers closing their positions creating the uptick. Once the market opens, they will start new short positions and it will crumble again. Please do not gamble anymore money on what social media wants you to do. Since when are unknown strangers online are ever on your side."
"‘Being Pressured by Media, Bots and Hedge funds to sell.’Nah, I think I’ll hold."
All of this kind of reminds me of the CHOP/CHAZ in Seattle. We all knew the summer of love wouldn’t end well....
No. Not the Short Sellers (we had them in our control). But Robinhood stole our fortune.
"Buy and hold, we are going to win. "
TAOP stock soaring just bought 10k its cheap to buy
"DFV is a god, and he hasn't sold. We will hold forever. Diamonhands."
"huge buy volume, over $150... in seconds they push it to a halt on low vol... restart... push it even lower on even lower volume.. halt again.totally normal .. nothing to see here... no criminality"
1PM EST!! is the $AMC BUY attack. get some cash handy and we will all buy from 1 to 100 shares each!!COPY and PASTE$AMC $GME $NOK $NAKD
"$20.00 fair market value, current value.... yea I will gamble 5 shares and see if it can do a quick double for friday. Bought in at 75.00.. only down 20% in 1 hour.. lolThis is hilarious.. glad it's my play money and not the rent checks.. is hold the line still a thing? Also, my daughter is making me diamond gloves.. oh its game time!"
GME AND.....https://www.facebook.com/groups/375393587167169/
Notice how agressive the shorts are in getting you to sell;)
Gamma squeeze time!! There has already been 6.5k in volume on the $800 2/5 Calls. Nothing like legal manipulation
Game’s over guys. Put your money in a real company. Actually invest.
Great news if you bought at 450Your only down 350 dollars. At least you get a tax credit. And for all you that think it’s not a lose until you sell it. I hope you don’t have any bills do.
$CCIV will sky rocket post market..Maybe merger announcement then also. .Massive purchases coming in. Possibly $GME deep pocket people jumping in?
"Seeeeeee, going to hit 130 EOD .... ahahaha"
Next week -- we will know the real numbers on shares short ...The real squeeze starts next week..... when other shorts discover that everyone is naked.... they are all thinking that the short volume is already down to 40 % ...LOL.....
Those of you still holding good luck  Sold my shares @ $59 yesterday had to cut the lost 
It really is hilarious how the news media outlets continue to post negative stories about GameStop. Join the bulls! Why does the media have to always be a negative Nancy. Redditors have been giving back time with their gains.
squeeze those lemons
Do you see this breaking below $40 tomorrow? Longs who have been shaken and can't hold through the weekend?
"sorry all longs but I'm out at 90 per, made a few gs. hope it moons for all of yall but I'm done."
$20 by tomorrow
Can someone explain to me why you would think GameStop is worth more than two dollars right now??? ￼
it looks bad now.. but as long as you put what you can afford  the possible payout was worth the odds. We knew what we was in for!
"$SIRC 100% today, I told you yesterday when it was up 20% to go for it, finished the day 104% up. $TSLA partnership and tax credits just announced. Go $GME $AMC $SIRC just look, before it is up 1000% next week and cry you were late to the party."
Here we goooooo
Bought at $483 and sold at $53.50. Was that a good trade?
"Stick it to Robinhood and Citadel, leave and go to either Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (bought by Schwab), Schwab, or tastyworks,"
52% short now vs 140% short olden days ... do your research ... there's no short squeeze left
"Wallstreet :- People don't buy physical disk anymore and so this company is dead.What they fail to look is while people don't spend on physical disk and use those freeium games more and more, their spending on those game disk now replaced with game console, accessories, computer, graphic card. Those are very lucrative business as well and clearly Pandemic which forced most to online and yet company didn't do worst is proof that they are here to stay."
"Margin calls creeping hard. Shorts, just sort out your debt, for if you wait till after hours, you will regret it! There is  money here!"
I doubt hedge funds have covered their shorts because why would they buy at 110 when they know that stock is worth 5 to 10 a pop
"Fact: Short sellers may have already mostly covered. According to a Bloomberg article citing data from IHS Markit, only 39% of GameStop's float is now sold short."
"shorts !!!! simple math you borrowed 10 apples, sold 9 and borrowed 9 more and sold again borrowed 3 more and sold took 3 more and sold promised to sell 6 and but there are no apples And you have to give one extra for every three apples. how many apples you need to give back and where you will get them.Diamond hands"
"Looks like GME is coming back to earth. Any interest in Tofutti (TOFB)? There's hardly any float so big investors might not be a good match, but smaller investors might be interested."
Me waiting for these Halts to end.
1pm all buy all world is with us
The sky is falling. I just saw gamestop pass it on the way down.

Hold the line today means losing half of what you bought this morning. That's real sound investment advice from a 10 year old on a message board.

"Well, I knew there was a rat. And looks like it's starting to come undone... WallStreetBets followers, you were punked buy a guy is a registered securities broker with MassMutual who was moonlighting on social media to pump up GME... And you guys took the bait...""Moonlighting under the name Roaring Kitty, Keith Gill became something of an online folk hero for his dedication to GameStop, the struggling video-game retailer at the center of a trading frenzy that sent its share price into the stratosphere.But now a regulator in Massachusetts wants to know more about Mr. Gill, a registered securities broker, and his former day job as a financial wellness education director at an insurance company based in Boston.Inspired in part by Mr. Gill’s cheerleading, thousands of small investors pushed stock in GameStop to as high as $483 a share and made Mr. Gill fabulously rich on paper. A picture he posted last week on the Reddit WallStreetBets forum showed his GameStop investment was worth $48 million, though his actual returns could not be independently verified.But Mr. Gill’s former employer, MassMutual, has told securities regulators in Massachusetts that it was unaware that Mr. Gill had spent more than a year posting about GameStop on social media, online message boards and YouTube. The insurer also told regulators that had it known about Mr. Gill’s outside activities, it would have asked him to stop or possibly fired him. …The Massachusetts regulator is investigating whether Mr. Gill or MassMutual broke any rules.""https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?srnd=premium"
You can tell the shills are scared when all the real investors have left and they are just talking to themselves 
In a couple hours when GME is down $10 buck lol
I wonder how many fake shares were sold today. How are the MMs going to explain that. Feel like this is very close to blowing up in the shorts faces.
down another 17% but im sure it will squeeze any minute now
"The great rotation is back underway now that $GME has crashed. The ONLY undervalued sector is oil and gas. Period. Now with Democrats in control, oil will be $125-$150 per barrel...Huge cash flow that will be used to buy the solar and wind companies that don’t go bankrupt. It’s obvious the only money to be made in this bubble market is on the commodity that powers 80% of the $88 trillion world economy.Stop chasing and start investing."
Gamestop's technology - selling used video games over the counter - is a game changer. A megatrend that will inspire next generations of merchants. Why are the shares crashing?
“RobinHood lifted restrictions” is starting to sound a lot like “he said he was gonna change”  who trusts them still? Y’all wild
They don't halt this when the HF are making money and it tanks!!!
Someone predicted a close around $120 today- do you think that’s acheivable
Would like to thank everyone who helped my IRA so I can retire sooner. Not often I buy puts but Couldnt resist. Super expensive
Nothing good comes easy. Was a pleasure to watch the movement.
"I bought 800 shares, let us ride into the sunset with fear and loathing"
Depression is real. Being forced to swallow unimaginable losses is deviations for anyone. If you feel shattered and thinking about ending it.. don’t even think you are worth losing. Your loss is only monetary. You will make money again. Call. A friend or family member of you want to end it
"Low volume pullbacks occur when the price moves towards support levels on lower than average volume. Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit, but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact. High volume pullbacks suggest that there could be a near-term reversal."
no halts when it free falls. halts when it goes up. game is rigged
You can buy 100 shares of gme at robinhood now - caused a pop?
Watch MARA next week... Great crypto miner to invest in long-term. $$ to be made in Bitcoin through MARA!
Why isn’t this down to $20 today like so many people were saying this morning.... I truly believe another squeeze is coming. Not as big but you might see low $200’s
Corsair @ a discount now. Get it while it's hot!$GME $AMC $NOK $BB
I have a strong feeling that the steam for GME and AMC is gone.
What Are You Learning Here About The Stock Market Folks?
"Two days in a row that BB closed higher than where it opened the day.Barely, but still higher.50M shares traded yesterday, and 32M traded today. Seems to me the people looking to sell BB after the recent run-up have sold.$GME down 42%+ today.$KOSS down 26% today.$AMC down 21% today.BB? Up 1%.Yes, BB participated in the meme stock mania. But unlike GME, for example, BB is not trading at nearly one TENTH of where it traded last week. (If it was, BB would be under $3.00 right now...!)No way GME or KOSS will ever again see last week's highs. It will never happen.AMC? Maybe. But I doubt it.BB? Yes. And not only last week's high, but much higher than last week's high.Because unlike those other three stocks, BB has a promising future..."
Why are PUTS not moving?!?!
"Don't you guys find it strange how so many people who supposedly ""have no positions in GME"" are so obsessed with the stock? If they have nothing to lose or gain from it, why would they be spending hours of their life commenting on this board? I'll tell you why, they're either bots, paid writers or complete imbeciles. Don't listen to anything they say, it's the hedge funds trying to scare you into selling. It won't work, all that's left is us diamond hands. Just hold and we win, it's that simple. Elon could be getting on board and just last night we had huge buys (one for over $4.6 million)."
is it just me or are they getting weaker and weaker after market? closed above 90 and they dropped it by 1 percent. is that the best you can do  holding onto these shares is getting easier and easier everyday while shorts keep losing sleep.
"message was delivered, retail investors took a stand , it was beautiful , but I'm feeling sorry for all those small investors who got burned big time ,longs and shorts, some lives will never be the same ."
I bought 5 shares of GameStop on Friday for over $300 purely out of principle ....I will not ever sell these shares....what the shorts do with Naked Shorting is illegal and must be stopped....the SEC stands for so especially confused.....they are inept
"Soon, Robinhood may need to restrict the selling of shares."
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Buy?hold? Sell?
Joining the long and wait to see how big short got smashed . Can’t find out how they can cover lol
"I'm not selling until $10,000IM NOT SELLING"
This has $40 written all over it for tomorrow.
Cuban just made the fundamentals case that GME could trade at 400 if categorized as a e-commerce play with high growth. LMFAO
halts on the low for the hedge funds. Why would it halt low? It's supposed to halt on the upswing.
GameStop appointed new Executives to push forward e-commerce and customer focused reform.Big news soon.
What robinhood investors look like:
can't even pull off 65... Fork please.
"Also per https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/GME/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/GameStop-Corp""Short Percentage of Float is the percentage of shares shorted compared to the float. As of today, GameStop's Short Percentage of Float is 292.53%."""

"Wait. I am no expert here, and I don't claim to be. However, this was a 2.00 stock. If it was shorted, wouldn't they have shorted it much under 2?"
$GERN is the next $GME
Pro's trade 6:00am - 8:00pm. Public trades 9:30am -4:00pm. RIGGED SYSTEM. Make 3/1/21 the day to sell everything related to Wall Street. Put them on the unemployment line. Cramer can go back to living in his car.
no good news for the longshttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/janet-yellen-treasury-reddit-gamestop-trading-frenzy
SEC should investigate all brokerage and clear houses for their pricing of option at market on GME they ripped off investors on both sides by not pricing options to stock movements at time of trade.
Robinhood removed all purchase￼restrictions on GME and AMC
Approaching the 40s
"""I used to work at scamming phone center but now I am hired by hedge funds to bash GME"""
I know this is going against the norm but what if GME starts to go up crazily again. Wouldn’t a short squeeze happen again? Just curious!!
"I sold at almost all time high 315,59 feels so good, sorry."
I am holding 5k shares @ 395 I am long not selling single shares
"$GME skoyrocketing again OMG, power to people. BUY MORE AND KEEP HOLDING TILL WE REACH THE TOP. CHEERS"
I was really rooting for this. But after Thursday and I was down half my investment and gave up. People should have stuck this one out but after Chamos announced he sold and donated to Charity and RH was limiting shares due to DTC asking for more money from them to cover in case margin accounts were to extended. The whole thing was a cluster !@#$.This needed to be better orchestrated. People should have stayed quite about things. Sorry for any losses that may have occurred to anyone.
BUY BUY GME !!!
GME will settle in the $100-$300 area and be fairly priced HOLD THE LINE
GME is strong. Stay long and hold! New highs til friday and price explosion next week. You can measure it by the trollposts here on yahoo finance :D.See you at 1000 USD!
I hope people here are playing with house money or at least small dollars. I’m sorry for those that lost money
The early Wallstreetbets pumpers of GME who bought in early at $5 and then scammed millions of Reddit users to buy GME and hold with diamond hands then cashed out their own shares at $450 leaving inexperienced kids to hold the bag are actually worse than the Hedge Funds. Wake up and smell the scam!
so... it dropped from +400... is that a short squeeze... or a paper hand squeeze?
sold at 340 and bought twice as many at 132.
"A brick & mortar w/overhead vs. Walmart, Kmart, Target, Amazon, Sony, Microsoft, Apple TV, etc...."
Distracting your mom from the stock price by showing her cool cat dance move. 
I know some better places to put your money but you guys don’t listen to successful investors so I’ll wait
"at the climatic peak, people and emotions always scream the loudestthat's a sign of a climatic peak this is repeatable market psychology"
"If you lose money, don't blame anyone else but yourself. I advised the people 7:30 AM yesterday to lock the profit (GME is at 398 at that time) and put the money into BB."
Just here to remind you guys I told you all to sell Wednesday of last week when I closed out my position up 300% and every time I did I got 30 thumbs down and 2 thumbs up. You guys are the bag holders. The play on this was never to be long. You guys were conned I to holding while the smart people sold before you
Let’s go pick up our fellow apes that bought at 300
"000000000000000000101010100000000000001010000000000000000000000game over,0101game crash01010101robinhood go bankrupt."
Just keep buying and holding its the same thing that happened with gamestop it did not just magically open up at 500 a share it had weeks of consolidation and shorts pressure. If we continue to hold it will only go up. The shortsellers are running out of time we have all the time in the world lets act like it and stick to the gameplan. No selling until we see $1000 a share. And this goes for $GME as well just because it already hit $500 does not mean the ride is over ignore the media the reality is it can very well exceed 500 a share which is why Robinhood did that wicked move and restricted investors from buying stocks. Leave RH and ride this up to $1000+ .... yes other brokerages were restricting but Robinhoods restrictiosn were by far the worst ...nothing else even comes close to how much money and time they cost us. $AMC $GMEThat robin steals from the rich and gives to the richer!
"It is Michael Burrys biggest investment, it hasnt squeezed yet, it can 10 fold... DFV is still holding it... Why would someone short this? This will go up to 300 EOW"
Why are there no available shares to short ??
This was trading around $20 before it popped!! So I think ur risk is 50% lower but ur reward could be 300-600-% higher if it spikes again
RH just removed the limitations. People who bought high will avg down. I’m in at $69.78. Hoping it gets back to at least that.
We can so this! Our target price is 1 dollar!Lets sell and take or money and invest baba! Atleast they have good earnings!!
"many new bagholders created, buy more guys, buying a stock that is halted every 30 minutes risking that in a blink of a second you can not buy or sell is great, this is russian roulette and who wants to hold such a stock overnight risking a gap of 50% down?"
Wow shorts won. Long gave up.
imagine all the fortnite skins you could of bought TIMMY! ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS SELL AT 400!
"$GME FLYING, WHAT ABOUT $AMC WAAAY CHEAPER "
"GME will fly on Monday. No doubt $100+. Up, up, and away!!! "
"the fed creates money, but in the market money is neither created or destroyed, it simply transfers hands. so now explain the crashes that happen every ten years...I argue that the market in itself is the pump and dump scheme."
did the stock halt at all on the way down?
Reading this board is better than watching Netflix lol...
HEDGE FUNDS HAVE TO HOLD UNTIL 4 PM we have to hold the line until monday!
#NAKD #AMC #GME LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Today we stand and fight! Hold the line and buy more if you can!
+60-80% tomorrow...might be a good entry
This will open 70+ on Monday
"WS is rigged. Up 50% halted multiple times, down 50% zero halts."
My fellow diamond handers let's just ignore the shills and bots and prepare ourselves for take off to the moon next week!
"Let’s start buying here. Sure, we’ll lose lots of money, but money doesn’t give to happiness!"
Would be amazing to see sub 10 tmr
A lot of  in this conversation. Hodl lads
Well I miss the way up and refrained to the jump in. But the writing seems to be on the wall right now￼￼. Take a profit if you can or reduce your loss. Just my opinion as an outside observer. Good work and congratulations to those who bought early￼ and got out at$400
The guys that kept saying hold the line....
"Everyone investing into gamestop was dreaming about houses, cars, and boats. Then their hopes and dreams got crushed."
was up 27% now up 41%. Shorts better cover before their losses at 100%

HURRAY... BUY LOTS OF 4 DOLLAR POOPY STOCK!
"What people don't understand is this kind of phenom doesn't die in a day. Especially if there are still 40% of shorts out there. Many paid bashers here are trying to create fear to drag the price down but think twice if you haven't covered your shorts yet or even were able to build new short position. GME is more than likely to see $80 ~100 before it goes below $40 if ever, unless they totally screw up in executing its biz plan... but it seems less likely since it looks like they are hiring right guys left and right.What I can tell you is GME has bottomed out AH, or possibly Friday morning unless it gaps up....for many reasons...still tons of shorts, trading limit has been lifted overnight, if Yellen/regulators try to come up with any kind of solution, it will be more toward limiting short side.And if you get rid of those last few days of above $150 range, GME is just one of those 1000 hyped stocks out there. Valuation? Currently 90% of stocks out there are overvalued.At least GME is not even trading @1x revenue under $80..... In a way GME is a bargain.Disclaimer..I started buying AH $50at and intends to buy more if it dips more and will sell above $75Now the market doesn't care what I say here. The only reason that I post is to share my 2 cents and hopefully it helps other individual investors like me to make money if I spot good long idea or not to lose money before they sell their shares on pull back out of fear and lose money.I never do momentum trading. I only buy undervalued stocks. Good luck to everyone!"
I am buying more now
"Buy for financial wealth, and buy to screw the retail shorts who have been claiming they won this battle."
She was up 9% a few mins ago now up 15%. wow.
KEEP BUYING. GOING BACK TO 200
"GameStop stores still remain empty. GME hemorrhaging cash. Read the articles, go to the malls! Why are you buying GME??"
Fellow Diamond hands keep holding building pressure so it can fly! We have saved gamestop and we saved out movie theaters now the next job is we save our wallets hold and wait.. yes its that easy. Its great seeing weaker traders become strong and strong traders become ....Diamond handed !!! $GME $AMC its far from over
call options expire tomorrow. Oh my!
2nd halt in 5 minutes.
$50 tomorrow
Funny you guys panic at this price. I BUY
...and what of Tofutti--TOFB? Tiny float on that one.
It is poised to explode anytime today and very soon it is going to be $300 plus easily. (very very strong buy)

Without such publicity, they coming back strongly and with this, I think it will speed up twice as fast.People already posting buying from GameStop around world. This isn't bad investment, their fundamental getting strong and with this rally it now extremely strong."
"We're bumping $AMC tomorrow, there's 20,000 of us pumping it up to $15+. Join in to catch the run up."
so if GME is most shorted then we can do another Short SQUEEEZZZZZ all the way up to 485!
I can’t mastrbate any longer guys. I need the short squeeze to happen by tomorrow

"I’m sure I’ll get plenty of downvotes on this but just know that I’m a holder of GME when it was near its peak. I don’t believe that GME is going to hit a second squeeze unless it gains the momentum it had last week, regardless of the short float. I can honestly see GME floating between $50-$70 for quite some time unless a BIG player like Elon jumps into the movement.All of this manipulation is absolutely outrageous and I feel for anyone who is sitting at a large unrecognized loss or sold for a large loss. Just know that if you’re a supporter of GME, you may have lost thousands but you helped take billions away from hedge funds and institutions and brought this blatant manipulation and broken system to the attention of the entire world. "
Did the “gamma squeeze” happen yet? Or are we still in the “short ladder” LOL
Too many people had puts so MMs had to clear some out from weak hands first now we plummet
  who sold
"Very bullish, GME is still shorted way above 100%. The hedgefunds are getting desperate, which is apparent if you look at the amount of paid shills/bots, the short-ladder-attacks and the pre/post-market manipulation.

They are messing with the mods, they are manipulating the markets. Yes, as retail investors together we are powerful. But our ship is in a storm right now. We need people like those celebs and roaring kitty to step up and refuel our diamond hands or we will lose. I'm not trying to scare people, this is reality. All the celebrities did was take our clout from a movement the retail investors formed. Tell them to put some skin in the game, it would probably make the entire meme stock movement 10x if they did. Talk is cheap. If they really cared for our movement they would. We need whales because the enemy whales are using every little trick to mess with us on every aspect. No shame in asking for Elon or Chamaths help. Mark doesn't even like the SEC. Tell Mark to help us with some money. He already fought the SEC before. In theory we were winning until they pulled some tricks. Now we need people like Mark, Elon, and Chamath to help us. I don't see us winning without real whales coming in and leading the charge when the entire world is agaisnt us.Guys gotta step it up and start spreading the word and telling your friends to tweet at them to help us out."

GME company are trying to take advantage of the share price and dumping shares at your expense. Sounds like they helping the hedge fund to save themselves.
I have lots of hope we get 200 by afterhours today. come on. I am all in.
Buy and Hold. we like this stock
Tomorrow GameStop will be 160-200 watch
back to $400

"Don't worry , we will donate a part of our profits. The economy will boom."
"GME is stalled, played out, no volume... Lower prices ahead"
I won’t believe any new short report on GME. The fine for lying is tiny.
"Today there was a short seller restriction on gme which means that the activity today was only by retail investors. The fact that it rose to about 18% at its high and then turned around to close at 2.68% means that the majority of people have zero interest in holding this stock for a short squeeze. The majority of buyers today were only looking to make a quick buck because of the market volatility and the absence of short sellers. The only reason this stock even closed in the green today is from the few ""diamond hands"" who are losing all of their money in hopes for another squeeze which isn't going to occur."
Load up! It's on sale! Buy the dips - said nobody about GME. It was an amazing experience though! I hope y'all recoup some of your losses!
Live look at the wallstreetbets gamblers
Hello I am considering opening a put on GME. For any seasoned investors out there what would you recommend for a strike price and how far out?
Millions of $ in Stimulus checks soon going straight into GME.
"Keep holding we are all in this together... well, kinda, except the smart guys who sold at $400, and those who sold at $300, and $200, and $100... but everyone else we are holding strong...right? Anyone?"
Investing is an art not a science. You may have all the tools and know all the techniques; however you may never paint like Bob Ross did.
"Don't forget, longs : You own a company nobody knew a week ago and which is LOVED by everyone who hate Wall Street now. Strong brand name, success in every move."
I hate seeing people saying the short intrest has increased but it hasn’t. Short Sellers are leaving and that’s what you need to cause a short squeeze. The greed of so many people in the board is sad. GLTA but this isn’t going to keep going up. Sad to see that GME didn’t take a stock offering to raise capital to stay afloat and pay off some debt like what AMC did.
"SEc should immediatly stop this, :trading with halts at dumped prices.Limited order at robinhoodmasstransfer of shares between two counterparts. that is huge marketmanipulation...................."
Short squeezes have a limited shelf life. It was a good idea...IN THE BEGINNING! That is history.
Who would possibly buy this stock at $50+ when it’s worth $10-20 and no possibility of a squeeze. Doesn’t make sense for there to be a single buyer at these prices.
Wow. Nice start to pre marmet
Downgraded to Strong Sell!Just running across my desk now is my downgrade of this stock to Strong Sell. $12 target.Thanks.
Most people here will be moving out of game stop and back into their parents house now.
are wsb still interested in this game ?
Waiting for the $GME sale Wall Street promised.....
WSB pumped and dumped and tricked all their followers with this short ladder narrative and also got them to blame Robinhood who was only trying to keep them from losing everything
"This thing is holding stable, if it was gonna tank, it would have. I watch stocks all the time, this isnt going anywhere anytime soon"
They open up the trading floodgates and this is it?
"If you’re somehow ahead on this mess, move your money over to SRNE. A heavily shorted biotech company that is under retail investors radars but is poised to explode with huge gains. Difference is you won’t have to try to time an exit as this company is just beginning to blossom. Do yourself a favor and do a little DD"
No position. just think the stock is down 275 points in 4 days
"Like AMC, I'm expecting GME to pop tomorrow before continuing lower the rest of the week. Trade carefully. These stocks ain't for the faint at heart. Hopefully that Reddit guy cashes out before losing millions more. Props to him though for keeping his word and holding while others are pumping and dumping."
One final #$%$ to WS? Robinhood allows unrestricted trading on a familiar stock today.. Game O?v?e?r? On???
"disclaimer: not financial adviceLet's goo team. Mark Cuban said it best. let's see what we have once volume trading is allowed and restrictions lifted. don't invest in more than you can afford.There are 6,610 put options (at targets of 235, 250, 300, 320)We are only in the 7th inning. Time to close out the GME""Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a #$%$ you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.That then accelerates the selling.Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particularSo what to do ?If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.""https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/glqidn6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3"

"Gamestop the one stop shop for anyone who doesn't have a computer, tablet, cellphone to shop online."
This is so a bull trap... most retail investors don’t have access to premarket let alone in those types of volumes
"The most disgusting thing about this whole ordeal so far wasn't even the elite pulling the rug from under the retail investors, but the disgusting messages regular people were posting about those retail investors on here. The amount of posts telling people to kill themselves, it was truly disgusting, and anyone who posted something like that should think about what they've become in their pursuit of personal enrichment."
Melvin is definitely atleast broke even from shorting this at 485 .. prolly made more money now .. congrats you play yourself
Not bad down 137 yesterday up two today!!! Lol!!!!

I have lost $500 bucks here...it was almost 50% of my investment
so what's up with these put prices.....did they dilute the price somehow? this isn't right compared to other stocks. hmmmm
RH is messing with you people. They waited for this to crash and now they are allowing you to trade. How stu..id they think we are?
buy NAKD on the dip.
"you told before that it was not volume sales and it was speculation, what is now? WHO SOLD this volume last 2- 3 hours?"
"Trading halt again, you see the game they play, it only halt when the stock go up and didn’t halt the last couple days when the stock went down"
Are robinhood allowed to buy 100 shares as of today? Or has it been that way for a few days??
"But the plunge tomorrow for a quick trade? Say $43, sell near $50?"
Cut your losses! Buying at this point isn't a wise decision. Sorry. I'm buying puts.
"20 till open, what role will RH play in today’s proceedings, how many times will the circuit breaker appear today, no position in this but imo these crazy kids may well hold this today, clearly support and resistance is there."
"Set sell limit orders at $10,000 and not a penny less!"
GameStop is 1000 dollars this week!!!!
who else is laughing at all those proud bots from yesterday?? oh man.. you know those tools didn't sell their $500 short positions...
"At this point it's a waiting game and to be honest it always has been. Hedge funds have to pay millions in interest out of their pocket until they can cover their short positions. Price may be going down, but if they don't cover all we really have to do is wait it out, which will eventually lead to a gamma squeeze. I'll gladly milk the hedge funds money and hold hoping for a SQUEEZE because it's definitely still possible. Again, it's a waiting game."
Bought 425shares @7 and sold @84. I will buy @7 again.
the shorts are so scared hahaha
Don't wait for it to dip. We need more support now!
mores share short now than when this thing started
Any survivors?
Look at how $PLTR is badly affected by $GME price movements. Tell me $PLTR is not mini $GME?
They should hire a lawyer to freeze the shares so that hedge funds can't borrow
GameStop will easily gain 250 in a day we’ve seen it
"guys just remember gme was 140% shorted to start with, shorts CANT cover even if they bought all the available float so just be patient and wait for the squeeze"
"All I got to say is look at the shorts working overtime on the message board. Put yourself in their head space, they could have unlimited losses and any positive momentum could trigger an unstoppable flood of buy orders and rising stock price. They are beyond nervous right now. Longs have already taken their hits and doubled down."
Over $100 again easily!!! GME is still over 100% naked shorted!
Wait before everyone is switching broker! We’re reloading. Another squeeze will happen again.
Today’s action is an important lesson for masses to see and understand what they are up against

"How to recover from your GME and $AMC losses. A detailed market summary.Popular opinion says the oil market is dead.In 2001 popular opinion was that the tech sector was dead.In 2009 popular opinion was that the banking and housing industries were dead.You make money when others are wrong. That’s where you find true value.The truth is that oil was hurt by COVID19. The lockdowns hurt demand by 5 million barrels per day. However, since April 2020, oil demand has recovered to 96 million barrels per day - from its 2019 high of 100 million barrels per day.The price has recovered to almost $60 a barrel.As the world goes green, oil demand is expected to continue to rise by 2% annually through 2050 - this is projected by green energy companies.The combination of anti-drilling policies and rising demand creates the perfect Bull Market scenario for oil. By 2023 oil will be $100 per barrel and will range between $100-$150 per barrel through 2050.The cash generated by the high prices will be used by the oil companies to develop better green tech and to buy out existing green competitors. It ensures their continued survival.Today you can buy many high quality companies at a huge discount to true value and get real income with their quarterly distributions.Examples include $ET for $6; $OXY for $22; $GEL for $6 and the $XLE ETF for $42."
RH lifts the buy restriction but the MMs and Hedge funds screwed the world and now the world is scared to buy. That was their plan just like the globalist scared the world into thinking masks are going to save you. No they find out infections went up and masks didn't deter a bit.

"Most caught in this GME fiasco are Bernie supporter type young people, the same mob as antifa, blm, those type of young people. Isn't it awesome to see them getting put thru the financial wood chipper now!? I love it! They can't handle ""consequeces"" for their own actions and choices because they NEVER have to face them, they avoid them by blaming others, not be spanked as children, and distorting truths. Since this latest battle THEY started, it's their OWN PERSONAL MONEY this time that's on the line AND already vastly gone down the drain lol. They are feeling this pain personally themselves for the first time! I love it! Wipe them out! There's alwaysSuicide Bernie supporting commies, don't forget that lol. Thanks. See ya at $60 this afternoon."
Feb 19th options showing $925
Ever seen a stock go up about 350% on a single Monday?? $AMC $GME to the moon!
SHORTS MUST COVER BEFORE WEEKEND> RUSHING OUT WILL PUSH IT to 75 !!!!
Does anyone know if Melvin Capital actually closed out their short positions?
Almost at starting point so in reality I took no loses just gonna hold my 1 share for history
TO THE MOON 
SLS may hit $200 today. Very few shares has already forced it up over 120% since yesterday.
"‘The pressure from Media, Bots and hedgies telling everyone to sell for their profits.’Redditers: Nah, I’ll just hold "
"GME is ready for a huge rally A lot of short sellers have piled on GME in the last few days. With Robinhood 's trading restriction gone on GME, a huge amount of GME be sold short and sold naked calls options, plus investors buying power, it is very likely we will see a huge rally on GME net week."

"continues to grind down, another 10-day low last night... Quit pumping this stock and taking people's hard-earned $$. The stock is lucky to trade in the $30 range."
The GameStop and AMC story will push the overall stock higher since fewer people including wall street firms will go short anymore.
Been telling you all to buy KHRNF. https://investors.khiron.ca/investor-information/news-events/press-releases/detail/200/khiron-announces-live-webcast-and-upcoming-investor-events No one listens..

Lmao imagine holding the bag on this stock
Longs please get out of this stock now. The song is over. I hope the new investors didn’t get burned too bad. The sun will come up again for those that got burned. I admire your stand on principle for what it’s worth. But accept the losses and learn a serious lesson. Dump the stock now please
"$4.20 per share is not a meme, I repeat, $4.20 is not a meme"
Do not listen to others or media we know what is happening and we will hold strong. Wolf packs taking it back today boys and girls!
GME and others have broken the normal ways of market functioning. Appl Amazon reporting bumper profits and not moving can be attributed to hedge fund selling those stocks to cover GME. The sooner it gets over the better. Nothing in this stock fundamentally .
"This short squeeze brings up a good question, who are the real bad guys? The Hedgefunds that influence stock prices, often shorting favorable companies and taking the common man's wealth? Or the Redditors, the first few the make a killing influencing the masses to buy while they sell and causing mass loss for the common man?"
It’s weird that $AMC and $GME charts are identical. Can anyone guess why that is?
"Friendly Reminder: At some point, a fund war is going to start over this, remember that not all funds are short on this, there are also much bigger funds involved that are not hedgefunds. That's when the real show starts. All the new printed money over corona will be gobbled up Wallst, the structure of finance is changing. There is nothing they like better than destroying each other. That's the show coming up."
"All these posts about ""warning"" people to sell now and not loose our money. Appreciate the concern but no thanks. I will hold these mfrs until the GME files for bankruptcy or decided to acquire Tesla. #BIGDICKENERGY"
every halt will make bigger plummets....the game is rigged and when you realize that...you can move on and make some money elsewhere...they are not going to let this run higher anymore...its going straight down to proper valuation around $10
Insiders are going to spill the beans on all the hedge fund illegality and encrypted ladder sales.
I wouldn't buy to make money I would buy to support the company you know like real investors do
"They will do a movie about GME for sure : ""The stock that broke the entire market"""
Dual war (AMC & GME ) together with hedge shorties..Don't give up
As more shorting information is made readily available lets keep purchasing as we KNOW THIS IS BEING SHORTED BIG TIME ( most shorted stock on the market). We must use this common knowledge to create short squeeze yes a squeeze is very possible by feb 15 as the hedge funds will have to pay MASSIVE PAYMENTS ON THEIR BETS ON THE STOCK.
"High five to all the longs and everyone supporting the cause. Feels good to be on the winning side, right? #GME #BB #AMC"
Lets try and reach for a new low of $30 for GME
This hits $50 I'm definitely going all in!
"What is GME's plan for this year, this quarter? What is its business plan? How much will be its estimate earnings? What is the usual P/E multiples for this industry? What is the short interest left uncovered? How much overshoot will be caused by the remaining short squeezes? Will institutional investors agree to sustain it on its new price? Where do you see the price will peak? When will you stop buying? Ask yourselves these Qs and get educated."
when it jumped back up over 100 I told you this was your best chance to sell now Im telling you again anything over $70 is a gift and its best if you sell and dont lose it all. This is the second last chance
"why did #GME and #AMC have the same daily lows at exactly 1046am, Wall St is rigged !"
"$1400.00 checks coming soon to ad some big time Ammo to this war. Back to a $500 here we go. Bought more yesterday at $59, but did not get back in after market at $49 because I wasn't paying attention."

"This is looking like a coordinated ""Pump and Dump"" scheme that managed to collect a large number of retail investors in the scheme... now they're Dumping at the Retail Investors expense."
"buy on dip, hold the line, diamond hand!"
"80 shortly in ah , I thought this was supposed to be at $10"
"I wonder why there's so much negativity and hate here. these guys posting aren't the ones invested, they're just trying to dissuade investors...as if they're bots... paid to create fud... working tirelessly yet so ineffective. LOL!$GME "
"Don't focus on the price, it's completely artificial. Instead look at volume, which is stupidly low. This is good, this means the shorts are running out of ammo and are just pushing back the inevitable short squeeze. Just hold (and buy if you can), like MARK CUBAN SAID and please do not listen to the bots on here saying to sell!"
Hanmer time. Hammer close? Rocket launch Monday? Time will tell!
here we go! get in before its too late
lol it's literally the case where if no one sold... this would still be squeezed to 10k
"Take whatever you have left from here, and put it all into $PLUGYou can thank me in 1 year when you are rich."
"Up and up ,green for today it looks like"
"Hedge fund makes money shorting a company more than 100% float and trying to bring it down to bankruptcy and people are OK with that, but retail exploiting this is wrong and need Robinhood and other brokerage to restrict buying and pretty much killed the momentum. The amount of people who don't have any outrage at the rigged game and blaming retail traders is why this country is in the state it is in. Pretty much a bunch of crab."
Short squeeze in $NAKD still building up. Be very careful if you're a short. NAKD is being pumped on social media as $GME gets attention. GME buyers are noticing the relatively 'cheaper' price of NAKD and starting to buy. This can jump 50%+ within any given 15 minute period...and then continue as shorts get squeezed. Keep buying NAKD in the thousands under 1.25 and hold.
My brother made 400k off this last week. I was to scared lol. But he’s giving me 45k because I told him about it so I guess it’s a win for me too.
LETS GO $AMC $GME
This is going to 75$ close
"The fight is over, the point was made, the money was made, now get out before you lose what's left."

"Shorts are making it worse for themselves. The lower the price is, the more we buy. And we are not going to sell for this fake price. Our price is $3000."
I guess I have an FBI file now
looks like we been duped again
"If you bought in at over $200, where is your exit price? $1000 (5x)? $2000 (10x)?For the people who had this stock at less than $20, $100 (5x) would be the equivalent of that $1000 price and $200 (10x) would be the equivalent of a $2000 for those in at $200.Jumping on a moon shot when you already 90% of the way there is only going to end bad. This stock will never see $1000."
Anyone buying at $50 ??
"hold until it reaches $1,000"
"What is sad is that many people that invested in GME are first time investors, they might never invest again -_- We need a constant influx of new lifetime investors! "
$amc $gme $koss when you see some average Joe bragging on social media about little guys beating the elites you know it’s time to leave. lol
I bought 358 shares with a price of 312/share. I don't know what to do now. do i need to hold or sell?
"For those who believe this current price, let’s be real.....this is being manipulated by the same wallstreet hedge funds selling their shares back n forth to each other to deflate the price.This wave is going anywhere. I will continue to buy the DIP because I love this stock!!!!"

what is the rule on halting due to volatility?I mean GME has been halted couple of times today but always when it was going up fast but if it sinks fast there is no halt.Can someone give me a good explanation (not just it's manipulated) but logical explanation please.
Don't listen to theses guys just check the market tourselves

It’s all about timing if you have a short term horizon. You can lose on a good stock and win on a bad stock. Long term it’s all about fundamentals and for GME they don’t look good. Hopefully more folks made money than lost but there are some people who truly deserve to lose because they knew nothing about what they were really doing.

"Hey all I do not own any GME but I thought I would share some GOOD investments for you. Have you been hearing the news about the semiconductor chip shortage? Consider the following:1. Both Ford and GM are having to take production off line due to the chip shortage.2. QCOM missed earnings because they couldn't get the chips they needed.3. INTC says they will invest ALOT in CAPX to try to catch up to Taiwan Semi.4. Apple says they will make a car. Really??? Where are you going to get the chips??5. There is approx 3000 chips in todays EV's, tomorrows cars will have more.My point is this : the Semiconductor Shortage will be greater and last longer than most people realize. I am buying LRCX, KLAC and AMAT. Do your own DD. GLTA."
"In this GME movie, the last few days have been the twist in the plot. Now we enter the second half of the movie, welcome to Gamma Squeeze 2.0."
This is plummeting worse than I thought. Is it the Janet Yellen meeting or are they issuing more shares?
"800-273-8255. Keep your head up my friends. To those who got out of this dumpster fire congrats. To those suffering massive losses currently, I'm praying for you and hopefully you find stocks with better fundamentals next time. Life lessons are tough but make you a better person at the end."
Where’s the brotherhood and solidarity now?
"For now, the GME hourly trend is pointing the momentum down, as more selling continues. You should consider other opportunities that will be breaking soon, such as NAKD under 1.20, NIO under 60, XPEV under 50. Don't get holding the bag with GME. Institutions have been doing this longer than you and have the resources and methods to manipulate the price as they see fit. People are losing faith as reality sets in as GME could not sustain over $100. Without a continue viral run again, GME will keep selling off as it stays below a huge resistance now. I don't short stocks, so I don't gain nothing. GLTA."
Hedge funds already made there money back shorting it on repeat. You boys lost now your just bag holding with hopes and dreams.
go go go!!! 150
"deep_f_value waited more than a year for the squeeze, buying and holding, waiting for good news. We're in a much better position than he was and the shirt interest is still ridiculously high, higher with every new share we buy and hold.Would you wait a year to have DFV's peak holdings? I sure would.DIAMOND HANDS"
Imagine thinking pre market was on ur side when all this time you've been saying pre market is manipulated. Lewrn ur lesson already
I can chill here for eternity waiting this short squeeze.If you all want to convince the little 200 or so people on yahoo stay lmao  but the main force on Reddit is holding loullzzz

"Restrictions lifted, 1000$ squeeze incoming"
"Must follow Reddit, must hold"
I just bought 350 shares @56.45
Hey WSB. Wall Street won.
CRAMER LOVES THIS STOCK MORE THAN HIS KIDS
Fierce community of bots on here going the extra mile to try to convince you to sell. Seems like someone must really want you to sell your shares. 
"Read the news, hedge are making upwards of a billion on your losses, you didn’t stick it to the man you just made it way too easy"
"Robinhood, What manipulation, you can trade these stocks, now you can't, now you can. I'd like to see their trading books as well as the fact they are in bed with Citadel and billionaire Ken Griffin. I think they should change their name. Robinhood stole from the rich and gave to the poor, not the other way around."
still think a chat room filled with folks buying 2 shares can move a marketlol
Honestly if people didnt sell out at 300 this could have went way way higher.
"Well the GOOD news is you CAN""T HAVE another 100 POINT DIP!!!!! bwahahahaha"
SEC doing what they do best protecting the big guys by halting on the way up. Where were they when the stock was going down. Fing rigged
"Rumor has it that if you print out your GME losses from brokerage account and walk into a Gamestop store, they will let you pick up 1 used game for free if you buy another one."
"GameStop Appoints Chief Technology OfficerAnnounces Two Additional Executive Hires to Support TransformationGRAPEVINE, Texas, Feb. 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp.

This manipulation is absurd. I wonder what the SEC is gonna say on Feb.18th.
Wonder who will be holding the bag at the end? Not me!

"This is a pure pump and dump stock. This company has never make any profits, last quarter each share lost more than 4 bucks! Looking forward to getting back to 2-3 bucks then no more hype"
why not skyrocketing?!:(
You’ve been bamboozled
It’s waiting to breakout!!!!!
LETS SEE THIS HIT 350$ again some realistic numbers
Like if the halt cannot stop us longs 
But Mark Cuban told me to hold. CUBANN!!!!!!!!!!!
"This trade has been a hot topic, but don't worry Treasury secretary Janet L. Yellen is going to get to the bottom of this mess with all the regulators. A sticking point for her to clear, though, may be $700,000 in speaking fees she accepted from Citadel, as recently as last fall."
hold the line
They made money moves with the extra capital. Gamestop has been revived
Carefully check the last 10 days chart. All the clues are there
Whoever has lent money in this stock cash the F out this thing is about to sink into the 60’z and even lower by eod
sold condo. bought gme
will this still drop tomorrow？
I'm holding and I'm 72 years old but with you kids all the way. The 99% low and middle class has been butchered by the 1% rich banker types.
"Wall Street, why is the stock up..?You told me there was going to be a SALE!"
Longs who held be like
MY AVERAGE IS 128 ! IS THERE HOPE FOR ME ??? 1500 SHARES.

typical bagholder :-bought at 475 with life savings-keeps screaming HODL-will be bagholding until 20-is buying more on debt-diamond hands
Gambling is what built america.
Told ya!
Mark Cuban on CNBC: “On Friday we’re going to see a reckoning. The Wall Street guys I know are planning for losses on Friday because the math is starting to turn. The momentum is starting to turn again.”So true
"Hold the line, I need price back to 350 to cover my losses."
"Broke $60s, still sliding DOWN... time is ticking to dump this stock"
"Green day today , everyone said this would have been cratered to $15_20 yesterday, yet it’s going up with obvious support and momentum, I have no position but see this at 75 - 80 close, perhaps these kids may hold it, dd and fundamentals out the window, it may hold"
Why is it going up before hours?
90% pumpers now 90% bashers. How do I sign up? I can use the extra money.
No offense but it over here.money finding new places to go. Looking for story stocks for the millennial crowd. My take is it’s the weed stocks again. This time it’s real with Dem administration in. Thinking Tilray going to be the biggest winner. Probably 5 times today’s close this year yet.
"I don't know if you are out there Elon Musk, $GME, $AMC, but we need you. Think of all the young people who will keep their jobs in the companies the slugs on Wall Street would like to extinguish..."
Were people (institutions) not shorting on the ride down from $480 to here?
thank God I sold 2 days ago around $110.good luck holders...
The 50s are here again!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think we all have been witnessing a reverse gamma squeeze LOL
All rookie know the short squeeze happened last week right?
Tomorrow $150+ at pre market
$GME Oh man.. Virtual mental health services gonna be in high demand for many late investors. Hopefully they can recover.
"My humble opinion. I would say keep resisting and continue with holding up now. I would like to see GME go back to $500 so you can cover your investments. Unfortunately the bears, too many of them both in institutional and retail bears are absolutely ruthless when it comes to them covering their short positions. I don’t recommend for bulls to act like them. Your battle is with institutional short sellers and small retail short sellers that I call the crumble zombies. The only voice you can spread is to ‘End Electronic trading AI software in the hands of criminals like the ones involved in shorting the economy and the people’."
An entire class of investors is trying to make their voice heard in a way that they’re usually shut out: Titan Co-Founder & Co-
100 today!!!
"this needs to be MORE painful for the hedge funds that over shorted this, they are getting off wayyyyy to easy here."
hedge funds don't know. diamond hands can hold for years living in their parents' basement.
"Every 10 years or so we have a huge bubble. It takes that long for people to forget the last one, and fall for the next one. How many of you remember 2008/2009?"
GameStop stock price will rise significantly today and into next week. Set your buy limits high and hold on. This is what we’ve been waiting for. Filter out the junk and focus.  
"Remember, just hold, it costs you nothing! Melvin and other hedge funds have to pay big interest on their short positions costing them billions! The short squeeze is inevitable. Also, do not believe any false data saying short interest has dropped, that's a blatant lie and it most likely remains over 100%!"
Who bought at 480 and is still holding?
$50 a share today 25 tomorrow Monday $4 a share Tuesday 49 cents then bankruptcy
"Retail investors have the shares the hedge funds desperately need to cover their short positions. If we hold and don't sell, we can later sell at whatever price we choose. HOLD!"
This stock is a perfect example of why shorting should be illegal or heavily taxed and regulated.
#Thesystemisrigged ... there's no denying it !!!$GME $NAKD $AMC $SNDL They just halted gamestop because it was starting to breakout again. Pure manipulation at its finest. In plain sight too.
who's still holding to GME?
By the end of today GME will be under $50. The pattern is there. Use the cash to buy the most squeezable company out there! $GEL...10% dividend low float and low volume! Owned by JP MORGAN! Get the MARCH 19 $10 CALLS for $0.15
This will easily make another all time high if closes above hundred on Monday.
well done diamond hands
"GME is a company worth MAYBE around $20 (price in Early Jan) that has lost money the last 3 years in a row and have been closing hundreds of shops, and still plan to close shops in 2021. The pump and dump is overso sell and put your money into proper companies or even commodities like gold/silver, as inflation is coming fast, with all the mad money printing going on. Sorry for people having lost a lot in this."
let me guess keep holding 
Should I buy now ??
"ROBINHOOD opened stocks, WSB armys droping money, WSB insider here"
"Leave this now, this is sinking ship.. going down.. invest baba"
It won't be long before GME message board goes back to being as boring and quiet as a library.
the waive is coming
"This has been one hell of a ride. I have been a part of WSB since January, 2019, when it had about 200k members. DeepFu%k*n@Value had a crazy prediction but his DD was very thorough and he made outlandish claims about the the percentage of shorted shares and the possibility of a squeeze. I was a lurker for years but long story short, I had about 20k that I had saved primarily from my hubby of buying and selling silver and gold. Long story short.. These were my positions:1162 shares purchase @ $4.72-Totaling $5461.40 ----- Sold 500 @ $342 Totaling = $171,00020 -26Jan $4.50C - Totaling roughly $2480.00 -------- Sold @ $4676 Toaling = $813,500Total RETURN $984,000!!!!!!Keep in mind, this is the first time that I had every bought a call option. I essentially had to watch youtube videos to even learn how to adjust my settings in my account to allow it. This journy has been simply amazing. All this started from me selling my 2004 Suzuki Kata for 10K.I still have 662 shares as a token and reminder of the chance I took to churn a profit and this has been life saving. Our WSB Sub grew from under 2 million subscribers to over 8 million in less than 10 days. I just have remorse for the people that jumped on the bandwagon and bought in at $200+So when there are ton of shrills talking pure #$%$ on the threads, I just laugh because my net worth is most likely all of theirs combined. 2021 has started off great for me. I have been on unemployment since May due to massive layoffs related to Covid and no, I stopped filing my weekly certifications, lol. I have barely been able to sleep since January 28th and I am taking several classes in what it means to be a true investor and look forward to making wise, logical decisions..."
$1 is coming!
"Very bullish, the hedgefunds are scared there will be an emergency board meeting and/or a reverse split, forcing them to cover every (+100%) short position. This may be the squeeze!"
Time to see reality. If this stock was really worth 80 dollars then people would be scrambling to buy it. The stock will go down until the last bagholder finally realizes that this company isn't really worth anything. It was basically a pump and dump to take advantage of robinhood investors. Just let it be a lesson learned. This will trickle back down to 20 dollars in the next month. Might get a pop back up to 30 but then trickle back to 20 then 15 whereabouts it should be.

"Hedge funds are losing their shorts again they can't buy back enough shares fast enough, that's Wall Street has halted the trade on gme one more time, yep they did not bother stopping the stock from diving this morning all the way down to $90 a share.

Yesterday you could have sold GME for $88 at market open and bought $GEL for $6.00; $ET for $6.00; $OXY for $21 or $XLE for $41. Warren Buffett owns OXY stock.Today start making up your losses. Sell at open before it crashes throughout the day and invest in oil companies. It’s the only undervalued market sector remaining. The bull oil market is here for the next 12-15 years.
To the moon!!!
Short squeeze? Huh? Those who think they are smarter than the people work in WS deserve to lose money.
"Americans don't have the spirit for revolutions (not necessarily a bad thing). Unlike other big nations such as Russia and China, which overthrew the system frequently."
Short Share Restriction in effect tomorrow...
my share being bought by mms at 4200.69 cuz its real closing power and not fake margin float...
20 shares!! Let’s HOLD. It’s us small investors that counts
"Shorts, can we get a raise of hands on how many of you opened a position this morning? I want to know how many of you I ate for breakfast (for calorie tracking reasons). Thanks!"
Be careful. Under $50 will be here again soon. Day traders
Listen all holders we need to make our voice heard before there a lot of us in here taking the hate from those saying this stock will reach 10$ next week. Let’s prove them why that isn’t gonna happen and continue purchasing to create a squeeze. ENOUGH FEAR WE STAND UP FROM THE ASHES AND RISE TO THE MOON GAMESTOP  ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS STAY STRONG AND TOGETHER THIS WILL PAY OFF. Love goes out to all during this hard time peace out .
It is a good day for GME. NOW OVER $100
Wonder how many of the folks got in at a high number and sold at a much lower number within 30 days? If so it’s disallowed as a tax lose. Wonder how many of these folks considered the tax implications of what they are doing? Will make for some interesting surprises a year from now.
"Steady flow of whistleblowers comimg forward to project veritas and they are hiring btw. Don't think your boss is going to save you corrupt hedge funds, banker's, and Trading sites.

Sell Sell Sell Sell!!!!!
I hope it really does go to 20 tomorrow
My 6 years nephew asked me what’ is going on with GameStop? I told the whole story and he said “Buy 100 shares for me and hold”
RESTRICTIONS LIFTED..WE CAN BUY ALL WE WANT.
U think 60% down is bad? Wait until tomorrow down 80%
Is it bad if the after hours is a lower price than close?or is that a sure sign of some major diamond hand power move?
$100 *+ today
Wait till earnings come in make kitty proud boycott gme runs
Everybody wants to get rich fast in this market. I had to learn the hard way over the years. Slow and steady wins the race.

"The concept of the movement is to refuse to be stepped on continuously by the rich. We made them rich, where is our compensation for being loyal and dirt under our fingernails. Stand for something or fall for anything!"
"I’m really sorry for those bought in above $200I don’t think will ever see that again, hope I’m wrong.Stay strong n move on."
Anyone still buying GME should save themselves two trades and write a check to their favorite Hedge Fund. This thing will be put down to rest slowly and methodically over the next 30 days.
instead of buy 1 at 1... we need everyone to put up a gigantic bid wall @3pm beginning of power hour. wall it off with like $2B of bids at say 110 - good til close / extended and basically wall it off and make them eat short fees/interest indefinitely unless they wanna buy $2B of bids
When your friend who watches football and builds birdhouses tells you about a stock it was over two days ago

"remember yesterday when it was down a lot before going into after hours, and then it kept going down more? same thing today"
the markets are riggedwhen brokers are limiting buy and sell rules
"Nice to meet you! Let me introduce a Japanese GME-like company called Tay Two(7610.T). The company, Tay Two, deals with game soft and used books as GME does. Its performance has been getting better and better since last year. Actually, its total capital stock and profit are about 70 mil and 10 mil USD respectively, and the company is considering resumption of dividend. However, its stock value is less than 1 USD/share, due to the stock market control by such securities corporations as JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and so on. The situation we are facing is very similar to GME. Could you please visit https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/7610.T?p=7610.T&.tsrc=fin-srch and buy stocks if possible. Beat JP Morgan and Credit Suisse together!"
The smart money has already moved on after selling to YOU!

"Notice when GameStop goes up, everyone is kind enough to tell us of a “Better Investment” lol"
"Who didn't see this coming? I admire the efforts to stick it to the hedge funds, but the reality is that Melvin and company can manage just fine even with several billion dollar losses. Maybe they don't upgrade the private jet this year. It's the retail investors who believed all the hype that are left holding the bag. Only invest what you can afford to lose on speculation plays! This company is worth $10 and we will be there very soon."
will be interesting to see how many people will hold over the weekend
"HOLD YOUR SHARESSET SELL LIMITS TO 1KDON'T LET THEM BORROW YOUR SHARES UNKNOWINGLY AFTER CONTRACTS ARE CLOSED TODAY PRICE WILL CONTINUE RISING AHHOLD FOR 1K, WATCH THE VOLUME ANY TIME YOU ARE CONCERNED. WE ARE WINNING. DO NOT PANIC AT ANY SIGHT OF RED.BUY DIPS."

"I fell in to a burning ring of fireIt went down, down, downAnd the flames went higherAnd it burns, burns, burnsThe ring of fireThe ring of fire"
This is a scam from RH and the elite. This stock is going back down to single digit within next week or so. It’s gonna take GameStop itself to justify its current value and stock price. Good luck folks!
"we continued to significantly advance our strategic objectives of creating a digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment and optimizing our core operations. Leveraging our omni-channel capabilities, we increased E-Commerce sales 257% – demonstrating our ability to serve our customers, wherever, whenever and however they choose to shop. Investments in improving our web properties and mobile app and enhanced fulfillment capabilities contributed to our E-Commerce channel’s sales contribution rising to nearly 25% year to date, well-above historical mid-single digit levels. Moreover, as the result of our ongoing optimization of expenses, stores and inventory, we delivered a $316 million reduction in SG&A expenses through the third quarter, ending the period with $603 million cash and restricted cash after repaying $10 million in debt during the quarter, and saw a 33% reduction in inventory compared to the prior year.”"
"EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT AT THE TOPListen, no one knows if this is over or not, we’re all human, stop letting random trolls on a message board affect you. Here is useful information that you need to know to help you make the right decision:On the 9th February, you will be able to see the up to date short float of GameStop. 14 Jan is when we saw the last update of short float which was at over 200% but up until now we don’t know how much that has changed. If it is still over 100% shorted, then that means the squeeze can still happen and will probably happen when everyone sees that short float stat & starts buying in. Until then there is no point of selling if you bought at the top. Why would you sell at an 80% loss if you’re only getting 10% back? Just wait and see how things play out. If the short float is still 100% on the 9th and food news about the company comes out as well by that time we could see a massive spike. I was someone who invested 10% of my portfolio before brokers stopped people from buying the stock. The worst thing you can possibly do is sell"
Regulators meeting over Reddit squeeze... Hope something good for the future of retail investors comes out of that meeting....All this started because of the hedge fund and shorties' GREED.....
$GME also positive! Amazing!
"Maybe the real gains, were the friends we made along the way."
"Can I get this out there early before the normal madness kicks in with run up to earnings. After watching 14 quarters, we will- not fly to the moon- not take off- not see a short squeeze- not emulate the positive line up like $GME- not be at $100 by the end of February But hopefully we’ll see a fourth positive quarter and first annual profit, respectable p/e, and a sensible tick up with future growth to come.3.5 years and still holding / optimistic."
"IF BITCOIN HITS $35,000 GME WILL GO TO $1,000"
The one who wants to push this price up are those with call option. If you are just buying this as a normal stocks then you will be a bag holder while those with call options will grab all your money.

"The SEC should investigate the trading here. No way does a stock like this accidentally close on the exact dollar amount three days in a row without some cooperation to fix the price. I'm not a stockholder but watching with interest like much of the world, and can't ever remember seeing anything like these closes three days in a row. It appears someone is sending a message (We can do whatever we want to your stock price). Hope I'm wrong, but it sure looks very odd."
The chart is classic Fear/Greed/Capitulation...CLASSIC. You are gonna have more upside here..to where im not sure
"If you'Re thinking ""this is a good entry"" don't. This company is overvalued at $20, this was a short squeeze play and there's no short to squeeze. Other good opportunities don't get fooled by the bag holders"
"If you gamble 100$ on lottery tickets you hold until the draw date. You lose or win oh well. Same here, each share is a lottery ticket. Only difference here is you now own a company and the draw date is not announced! Wait until that draw date before claiming your ticket as a loss or win!"

If you can’t hold pass it up until you can hold!
"Any it goes all the way to $5/share and we still don't sell , how do they close their position , are they happy just paying interest , how long ?"
"If I buy in now, do you think GME will go back up to $480?"
Is gamestop still going to the moon? It's not looking like it's going to the moon.
Why do I have the feeling some long hedge funds are gonna try and wipe out some short and exposed hedge funds. Fairly easily as well
"thx wsb, keep buying gme, keep the shorts away from the rest of the stock market."
Do not sell! 1 year price target $13.44! Patience is a virtue!
To many people own gme now For the price to crash. Sorry shorts
You guys told me to BUY BUY BUY at $135. Now it is $95. What do I do now ? I lost a ton of money .
They shorting attacking all the stonks across the board. $EXPR $AMC $GME $KOSS $NAKD $NOK $BB etc.You think they trying to do this to save their quarterly report? LOL. I don't see them continuing past April.I know that seems long time away but who can out wait who? I'm willing to hold for however long it takes them to start covering shorts. Even if that's +1 year. I doubt they can say the same.
The restrictions against GME has been LIFTED... GO GME
Don't sell 114 million shares short
"And If institional selling all those stock they selling, end of day we will have retail holding all most all stock. Once we control full float, Those short are in deep trouble."
"Unless you are actively day trading this you are just throwing good money out the window. Maybe pick up your remaining cash or margin and move onto something with good fundamentals. Almost all wealth is made with long term investing in companies that are solid have a future.I said $60.00 was a good time to exit yesterday afternoon. Let's see where it tracks after the opening pump n dump.And if you are still dreaming of GME going back into the triple digits, I have a few items I would like to sell you.Overall, I genuinely feel for the bagholders here that have been duped. I have been there before, not on this ride, but on GoPro's IPO to name a semi recent one. It is not fun and definitely not a good feeling going into the weekend, but if you can get out today, do it and chalk it up as an experience. Take advantage of the bump up at the open. You are not going to come out ahead on all investments, and I hasten to call GME one, but learn from it and live to trade another day. The GME experiment worked for what it was intended to do and it is now abundantly clear that 'diamond hands' left the building.Further, there will be no upgrades or positive announcements coming to reverse the inevitable."
easy 300 at least next Monday
BUY AMC GUYS
no selling til 200s! they are desperate... their plans have failed! GME lives on for another week!
dont understand the reason for the massive sell off think some of you need to a grow a pair
"Do you think getting the ban to short on NYSE is creating this upward press? I am long by the way. Just trying to understand, the price action"
Damage has been done already.
Most of the shares were bought under 6$ because we’ve been at this way before it blew up in media. So OG DIAMOND HANDS ARE STILL HOLDING! so most of us will hold until the end of time. YOLO
We going to the moon on Monday.
"It’s up and it’s green for the day I think, fascinating to watch the up and down, where do you guys think this will go? Thoughts"

Justin Sun crypto billionaire buys 10 million GME shares https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-gme-amc-share-price-sell-or-hold-the-line-on-reddit-stocks
"A lot of good, well-meaning folks, retail investors that got carried away in the WSB Reddit trading started buying call options without fully understanding what options are or some of the legal consequences of options expiration. A customer who buys 1 call option (a 'contract' ) purchases the right to buy 100 shares at a certain agreed-upon price (the 'strike price,' or simply the 'strike') until the time of expiration (the 'expiration date.') What they may not realize is that if the share price is ABOVE the strike price at the time of expiration AND THEY DO NOTHING, the brokerage will BY LAW, AUTOMATICALLY exercise the option for the customer – meaning that it will buy 100 shares at the strike price FOR EACH OPTION CONTRACT that he/she owns, even if the customer does nothing, charged to the customer's account.Say a trader got carried away trying to 'stick it to the man' and bought 100 call options. Say then the stock soared above the strike price (becoming an 'in-the-money' call option or simply ITM calls as they're acronymed). Then, if the purchaser doesn't sell these call options for a profit BEFORE they expire, without other instructions from the customer, the brokerage would by law have to EXERCISE ALL 100 OPTIONS CONTRACTS, or100 times 100 = 10,000 shares of GME at, say, a strike price of $240 per share, equals a $2,400,000 GME stock purchase!A lot of people didn't know what to do at the time of expiration, so they did NOTHING.They woke the next day to find they had a HUGE MARGIN CALL- more than many times the value of their home, because they had just 'purchased' a huge number of GME shares even though they had no idea that it was going to happen.That's why there were a lot of people on the financial networks saying that it was was going to 'end in tears,' and I feel really bad for those people. Just please be careful out there."
HOLD! HOOOOLD!!! HOLD THE BAG!!
Just watched an interview from yesterday. Definitely recouping $GME losses and SOME!!!! Expecting some big acquisitions in the near term and potentially even a buy out from a bigger player.
if everyone on this board went to gamestop and rented 1 game this weekend it would probably gap up to $500+ monday opening
I love this new casino.
"I shorted at 99, Charles Schwab required a 100% then 200 and finally a 300% margin, even with that in account, they said that they could close out the sell at their discretion. I closed my position at 217 and 279. As I said before, you will never beat them at their own game. They controlled the stock on both sides."

If it weren't for the manipulation and the they can't purchase any stock only able to sell with limited purchase lately and that's why the stock is going down if that wasn't the case of stock would be at $1, 000. It's like going to a knife fight with nothing. Wasn't a fair fight hedge funders needed to cheatneeded a cheat"
hey  can you sell some shares? i want to buy more
"I your down on GME, just sell way out of the money call options each month to earn the money back. Hopefully your stock wont be called if it is you can buy an equal shares back. Then sell calls again."

Honestly everything knows this stock was going over $500 when all of a sudden Nasdaq halted trading then Robin Hood said you can't buy but can sell??? I've never ever seen this happen before ever. Market manipulation
Remember whale shorts have to cover their positions soon. Price will go up.
"The discount today was HUGE. Doubled my AMC Position and added whatever I could in GME. This whole thing is bigger than you and me. What I do know is if you're holding on to your shares, you will be compensated one way or another once this thing blows up in Wall Streets face. Throughout the years they've been able to manipulate people through these many tactics. What's different this time around is for the first time in history bone of those tactics are working. THIS IS BIG. Because eventually, very soon, they'll have to accept the losses and these stocks will blow past these orchestrated prices."

Found a service that tells me buys and sells. https://daytradingsquad.team/TTG-Instant-Access"
$GME $AMC up today! Lets go $NAKD $NOK
It won't be so bad. They are raising minimum wage to $15 and shoveling driveways is off the books.
yahoo is blocking my comments
NAKD was at 6.4 million shorts yesterday. Today only 2.2 million shorts remain this stock is currently $1.25 calculate how much you can put in once you sell this and recover your losses this stock has huge potential.
Moon?
GME investors should go and buy IPOE. IPOE is taking SODI public and the stock could fly over $100 this year easily. IPOE is trading at huge discount $25.18. SOFI is the crypto currency future. Chamath is behind IPOE and he knows what he's doing. Buyers of IPOE will make huge money this year.
That was a crazy ride now let’s do the same thing up! HOLD & BUY!
its gonna squeeze
Just bought out of the money $70 call options expiring today. Let’s GOOOOOOOO!!!
I love GameStop.....It's just always been really Cool. But I Love  you people more. You're all so cool  and I enjoy your posts. Power to the People!!
If we're still above 100% short interest then hopefully it goes back up
Shorties after the sqeuzzeHahahahah
"no need for excuses, it wasn't robinhood, the media, ect. you held to long and got played. take the lesson and the loss and move on. about to take one with AMC. thats life"
Beware if you have a short position now. Market Cap under 5bn and somebody can just scoop 50% of the shares. The name alone is now worth more. The situation is completely different than last week before the surge. Going to buy more popcorn
if only you hoodies held like you said you would. I've got some diamonds to sell if you're still interested BWAAHAHAHAHA
That’s all I gotta say...

"STRONG HOLD#$%$Analyst- Sebastian offered four possible scenarios as GameStop focuses on its business model moving forward. The most likely scenario, according to Sebastian, is for the company to concentrate on ?faster e-commerce growth,? together with some store closures and a ?slower/gradual rollout of new services.?"
Nice trade from 53 now 78.
"When a billionaire who is into stock tells you to hold, you hold.Thanks M. Cuban!"
"What really happened: Going to keep this simple. Last week, you got a lot of sheep chasing a few lucky reddit posters who had already made investments in GME going back to last year. These sheep started to feel like they knew how the stock market worked or at the very least thought GME - a company that is going broke without a doubt - would hit $1000 or even $5000/share. I mean why not? Little did these sheep realize is all their reddit idols had already profited off their sheep-like tendencies. On top of that the real experts in the hedge fund business got even better short positions. If GME was a great short at $20/share, what you think it was when it was $400/share? Bottom line: hedge funds (the smart ones) got even richer and reddit plans all but backfired. Same Story Different Dummies..."

"I would imagine the short traders here are newbies, Experienced short traders would be over at $AMC and $GME about now. Long $OCGN, should see several mini rallies over the next few weeks. Should be very profitable if you hold this."
Im holding strong. Short float is still high. The volume doesnt mean much to me given the immense quantity of small shareholders.
buy AMC!! HELP US BROS!! :D
You can't make a stock go up just because you wish it would. Eventually the adults in the room regain control and natural selection runs its course. This time next week market efficiency will return and GME will be just another footnote in history.
FORWARD!

why is everyone who isn't buying gme on here straight up insulting people?
All of these negative posts laughing at the price dropping are actually funny. They’re so obvious it makes me even more confident in holding and buying more.

"@Pablo according to a retired senior broker who has described gme situation is no way out for shorts until owner settle down or short got busted.

-40% (tommorrow another -40%)
Remember folks: you never lose money if you never sell
It's time for a bounce back from 50 day. Enough is enough .... GO GME !!!
FNRC is flying this week. FNRC is at .00005 with 870 Million shares traded today. Maybe looking like a short squeeze.
"we shouldn't let any single shares available for shorts, simply just put your shares for sale @ 1000. until it sales , do it now ,"
"The ""GameStopped"". How much did you lose?"
"Hey shorties, how is the awakening ?"
Leave it to reddit to double down instead of being massively redpilled by this. Enjoy the dystopia that will be the 20's. You created it.
On Monday GME could open over $100.
Imagine selling yesterday
This is great company attacked by short sellers as a revenge on its CEO for supporting $GME short squeeze.Buying that dip.
after $GME $RKT is next......Big short squeeze coming.
"you only lose if you sell, only a paper lost, if you bought in the 400's , average down, big boys is just trying to shake you out, hang in there"
GME will close -20% today
Shorty to his wife this coming Friday EOD puts expiring
Back to the moon
"out of money, but need to buy the dip?never trade on margin.ask your parents for money to invest in a sure thing."
buy now. double up at noon. 150
Pumpers are now realizing we weren’t the bad guys !!!! Sometimes you have to live by reality and face the truth !! 400 was the peak this ain’t ever going pass 150 again !
"If only we could sell snowflakes to snowflakes...If they will by GME above $15, they will buy ANYTHING!"
"When they said to the moooooon, they were talking about someone dropping pants and showing everyone some cheek."
'Squeezing shorts'? I picture Spandex - depends on who's wearing it. I just like the stock. Holding.
so where is the moon guys?
THE ONLY WAY GME GOES HIGHER IS IF YOU BUY AND HOLD. SIMPLE. JUST HOLD AND freakin wait. HOLD THE LINe and the price will go up.
"They are trading between themselves and covering shorts artificially. This gets them out of the immediate debt but pushes it further with apprx. 30% interest, leaving the overall short interest unmoved. They have a lot of funds so they can do what they did today over and over until their boss calls and says enough is enough. Once they are not allowed to pay any more interest, that's when the squeeze happens. That's what a squeeze is. What happened last week isn't, it was just the sign of an oncoming squeeze. So, hold."
I was about to buy when it dip to 200$ thank god I didn’t buy
superb support at 55-56. Could excess 54-53 at worse. If you really wanna buy this now is the time. From the guy who sold SAVA at 115 this morning.
"Again, if it’s truly 100% short, put limit sell orders on your shares , so that the market doesn’t have yours to lend out!! Put your sell orders in at $300 or $400 or what ever you want. You can always move it up, good problem to have"
"For every 1 person that got rich from this ,100 people went broke . It’s pretty sad actually"
So much for holding the line lol
Thanks for the fun movie. Let’s do it again tomorrow bag holders
PUTS GETTING COOKIED
High prob to close at $30 and open at $10
"Everything Gamestop will launch will now be a success, like Tesla, you own a top name."
How to see the short?Can anybody give me the website?Thank you.From Japanese army
"A lot of influencers used and abused the WallStreetbets newbie traders. Instead of telling them good job now run for the exits and book profits, they misled them, probably while they ran for the exits themselves...secondly, its very likely many of the pumpers were actually bots and fakes working for hedgefunds and big money who needed them to ""hold the line"" so they could take their money. Wall St never loses in the end. Many overstayed their welcome just to be part of a movement..The object of this game is money. The point was made...but many were then deceived into believing they could outsmart the greediest human beings on earth...They adjusted, manipulated the rules and profited in the end. That's Wall St for you."
I think gme has a superbowl ad this weekend kn Sunday? buy.buy.buy
shorties like
"Nothing goes up and stays up but the same goes for a drop like this, we should see a pop back up and it will be a violent one IMO"
"What I have learned from this ordeal is a lot people lack patience and conviction. The shorts got hustled at their own game. Now they are attempting to clear the wreckage from their gross misconduct. Hopefully, enough GME stockholders realize what is happening and persevere. If the stock goes much lower, I am buying."
"It’s over. If you did not sell at 400, don’t bother now just ride it back to zero."
"GME doesn't worth more than $10 (based on recent analyst post). People managed to pump it from $3 to $500, creating a huge short squeeze that caused several hedge funds to loose billions. But after they covered their positions, people naively believed that they can take it to $1000 or even $10,000 - they didn't believe that the hedge funds really closed their positions. Well, they have, and now the stock is probably on it's way to a $10. I encourage people who lost precious money not to get depressed, you learned very important lessons which I learned myself many years ago:If you want to ride the hype, do it as early as possible and sell in the first signs of weakness.If you invest in stocks, invest in good companies with good business performance, and stay long (diamond hands). Allocate only small amount of your funds to adventures like this.By all mean, this is not a trading recommendation, this is just what I learned myself during the years.Sorry for being a ""boomer"" (Boomers are just millennials with more life experience)"
squeeze out every bit of hope before it drops to 30 bucks LOLEven the owners of GME sold!
Now let’s see what Yellen is gonna do at the meeting.It’s her first time in the top position doing something so whichever side she picks will serve as an important reference to future situations.
Why are they stopping the stock such #$%$ and totally unfair
Shorts have covered alreadyYeah of course
It's not a bull trap as the whole anti hedge fund stock are rising. :)
"war'sd over , move on to a stock with potential ..BB"
"GameStop just hired two new executives, one from #chewy and another from #amazon. Bright things lay ahead."
Shorts gonna burn today!!! Ahhahahahha get ready for some fun!! RESTRICTIONS only reason this dropped!!! And now they are lifted!!
"37% rise from open , look at the money pouring in its incredible , imo could we see this at 150 Monday"
"Did I tell you that I met my girlfriend at Gamestop? She was waiting in line to sell a Nintendo 64 ""she found"" so she could buy some crack."
If hedge funds shorted more than what stocks available at the beginning they need to get your share ms to close to return them .. sell your shares at the price you like to sell it .. 1000$ this is what I’m doing
Buying 10 shares each hour. NOT SELLING.
"There is so much pressure put on us to sell....The media is saying it (paid by hedgies)The bots are spamming it.Some weird SUPER considerate (suspicious) random guy shows up and says sell, take what you can salvage....Meanwhile on Reddit:Nah, I’ll just hold.BUY THE DIP!! BUY THE DIP."
"The reddit crowd could drive $NUGS (Cannibus Strategic Ventures up 1000% in 15 minutes and 10000% by days end.. NUGS annual sales are larger then their Market Cap, and the price is only $0.08 per share."
If they can’t keep it down before 7 am it’s going to be a great day and once that momentum starts watch out— let’s a few more billions in losses ....#08payback
"Very bullish! If an emergency board meeting and/or a reverse split is executed the shorts will be forced to pay up, to the moooon!"
"The current support is more manipulation. The dealers are propping GME up at a level that most options set for expiration tomorrow will expire worthless. There is a large number of puts with strike prices at $ 100 and below. Also, a lot of calls over $100 will be worthless. It’s just another way the game is rigged."
$gme $nakd $bb $bbby $nvax $amc BUY SNDL going to the moon!!!!!!!!!!! i got my rich friend buying now too.
"If you want to gamble with your money then go to a casino where the only person who will have better odds is the dealer. In the stock market, you're betting against other people who know more about the company than you do."
About to go positive in after hours! That’s a SUPER bullish sign.
Bag holders who went in with all their money.
interesting how the stock markets dropped as funds covered their losses.
"Is there any insight into what Cohen did during this squeeze?Did he sell, hold? Would he need to file with SEC if he made a move?Right now the only move left for another moonshot is for the price to totally crash and then a whale moves in and either buys up a ton or takes it private. This would be in line with what happened during the VW squeeze.I have a hard time believing the short interest isn't as high or higher than it was before - just at a higher tipping point now. After all, there was FOMO on the way down (profit on shorting).That being said, my lesson learned was to follow the trend line....use trailing stops...and ignore everything else.I'm still holding."
"Wow, did you see how the price went up in 30 second. Up $18"
"GAP UP Monday and then massive climbing, option hiding shorts have to cover !!!"
"I Agree hold and buy more, DIAMONDS!!!"
"""Ironically, some on Wall Street have urged the SEC to investigate the WallStreetBets subreddit. They’ve got it backwards: It’s time for the SEC to do what WallStreetBets had the insight to do. It’s time for the government to take on the shorts.""https://rick-axon.medium.com/i-run-a-public-company-5b6347fc0b1f"
ALL NEW BAGHOLDERS PLEASE CLICK LIKE ON THIS !!! Min 1000 shares please
No More 100 Point Drops as GME stays below 100 now!
30s tomorrow?
You wanna know why house always wins? They take the emotions out of gambling.
Some bag holders are in such shock from this whole thing that they don’t know what to do lol.
I actually believe this could go under 20 tmr
"there's nothing more feminine than a millennial ""man"""
$GME will probably soar from here. I think the real squeeze is starting. Would be nice to see this on $AMC also.
"Dont sell because a price drops. Look at the news. Rich people keep coming in to invest, they wouldnt do that if it were a dying company. Dont let these price drops make you panic sell and regret your desicion later on. Do some research (not financial advice, your money, do what you want)"
"Oh i should have added, the people who are long the stock don't care about the company's fundamentals. This is not a good strategy."
STOCK BACK UP LETS GOOOOOOOO NY ORDER JUST GOR FILLED
Why do you all insult us and at the same time giving us the ”advice” to sell? Strange behaviour
Stock hits $25 tomorrow
"oh man. I truly feel bad for any amateurs who dumped their life savings into this and couldn't get it out. I learned early, when trading don't buy into the hype. If you're seeing it on Twitter then you're too late to the party"
"I see many of us are excited that this has triple digits, which is a great sign! No matter if it goes down or up, remember that they need the shares that WE OWN. The buy to sell ratio is skewed way on the BUY side. Furthermore, the more we hold, these hedge funds have to start paying interest. At some point they're going to have to give in. Also, there's going to be a meeting tomorrow regarding short restrictions, which have already been imposed on GME. All I'm saying it enjoy the ups, but don't overreact to every up and down. This is a ride that we must wait out. As long as we hold, we can sit here whereas the hedge funds will have to decide whether they want to keep paying interest for all their short options, or give into the gamma squeeze when we really take off. Stay strong and please take care of your mental health as well during this time!"
"Hedge funds are saying this trade is over, assuming we’ll not take them on where the odds favor us. Odds highly favored cannabis like ACB, and EV vehicle manufacturers in China, like Li Auto and NIO, which both just smashed earnings estimates."
Heading into the weekend like..￼
"1000 shares from $96 I don't even care anymore if this goes to $1 or $0 ... I will keep it and say, ""look a got this when the Hedge Funds manipulated the market and everyone SEC see it and just do nothing"""
PT $1000
"I had a measly $2400 invested spread out over AMC, EXPR, NOK, and BBBY. I held Bc i it’s just $2400 and I never saw a profit to begin with. I’m seriously curious to know of REAL testimony from people that bought into this thinking it would go to $1000+. People that sat on serious gains and have now seen them lose 70-80% value. People that went from being ‘paper rich’ to bag holders. Who’s to blame?"
They said GME was going to 1000 I wanted to be part of the movement. The revolution. I held. I still own the shares.
Hi - you’ve reached Reddit Investments customer service department. Please hold.

Robin Hood no longer have restrictions on buying. See you on the moon.
"IMPORTANT - NO SHORT SELLING ALLOWED TOMORROW ON GMEToday, GME is down over 60% from yesterday, meaning that the SSR will take place. We should expect a large increase in price tomorrowThe short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day."
Remember withe the restrictions lifted as of this morning not only more people are buying but also that 112% of shorts will be covering as well. So this is going to shoot up today.
shorts will have to cover soon!
We have A free market for 2 days because NYSE says it’s banning short selling.

Congrats GME reaching new lows
Watch the trend. You’ve made your high today. It will continue to fall. Take your cash and invest in $GEL $ET
BUY BFT. It's taking PaySafe public. Buy IPOE. It's taking SOFI public. Both PaySafe & SOFI could easily see over $100 quickly. They're future of banking and Financial industry.
"Imagine having bought $KOSS or $GME this time last week and holding.There is no way these people will ever see their money again.$AMC longs? Maybe. Depends on COVID, when theaters open, if people feel safe to go; etc. In the end, however, streaming at home is the future, so AMC has a limited shelf life regardless.$BB longs? Zero worries. In fact, if you bought BB last week and are now down buying more at these prices will likely prove a very good buy.BB hit a high of nearly $29 last week on the meme stock hype. I expect BB will trade far higher than this price in 2021.The other stocks listed here? Highly unlikely they will ever again see last week's prices."
Time to make the hedgies hurt
"As I said before, you need to take a look at the financial data provided by the company and not blindly invest. Stock market is not a game, there is always the risk of losing money, and the biggest risk is when you don’t know what are you doing."
"I hope those who fell into the trap learn their lesson here. Never be the middle or the last guy to play any rumor or hype. Remember, the newcomer will become the hyper. I hope WSB lose their credibility when new generation realized they got punked with their last hopeful stimulus check."
"A quote from WSB by somebody who tells it like it is:""When I joined this subreddit last week, among hundreds (maybe thousands) of posts I read here and definitely many thousands of comments, I didn’t encounter one post or one comment saying “I will take profits”. I saw 100% of posts saying “I will hold” until $X. That X was above $1,000 in each and every post.So, as far as I’m concerned, this was supposed to be a group effort to squeeze the hedge funds. I never knew this was a bunch of individual traders acting in his/her own interest. Those who sold at $300 or above on the way up or on the way down should have been honest about what they were going to do. But, they took advantage of those who believed in the cause. In fact, I’m sure most of them made posts here about apes with diamond hands just to goad the new comers into buying at insane prices because “everyone was going to hold” until the epic squeeze was induced.Nothing new here. That’s how humans act. Animals are much more trustworthy. When a pack of wolves hunt a large animal, they act together until they corner it and kill it for the benefit of every one who takes part in the endeavor even at the risk of being killed. Humans betray others at the first opportune moment.I stand to lose about $5000 if GME goes to $2. I didn’t lose this money to hedge funds. The money was stolen from me by the WSB members who engineered the runup in $GME by getting millions of people to buy into the ruse of an epic squeeze. These thieves knew all along that they would dump their shares upon the new buyers at the top of the hype they engineered.It’s not a pleasant feeling, but it’s not the end of the world for me. I would never have gambled that much, so it was a moment of weakness for me when I decided to trust in the goodness of humanity. I had never allowed that to happen to me before WSB, and it will never happen again. I knew better, so believing in the goodness of the people was a temporary lapse of judgment, probably induced by a certain degree of the COVID-19 related mental fatigue."""
BYE BYE GME... REALITY TIME
I wonder why bots are still here.I THOUGHT HEDGIES MADE BILLIONS ALREADY.WHY ARENT THEY WALKING AWAY?!?!?Maybe they are hiding something.
"shorts and hedge are integrated in the system, can be shaken up a bit but they will continue to manipulate market unless gov't steps in"
What did u expect....easy come easy go....the winner takes it all....This time big institutions
Question what if I keep buying on regular intervals $20 every two weeks? At some point in your analysis GME with all of its new money turns it into a thriving company worth $500 a share. Whose going to be in a better position? Don't forget the dividends!!!!!
I and HOLDing
1000.00 here we goSpace X buys video game consoles for all the rockets.
"Selling at this stage makes no sense. Even if the stock goes down to $30, hold it on until next earning report"
HOLD TO ZERO. SHOW THOSE HEDGE FUNDS WHO'S BOSS!!
HOLD AND BUY THEY ARE SCARED
"Come on guys, if #AMC and #GME have taught us anything...BUY AND HOLD to keep these prices high and make us all money.The real money is in LONG TERM gains, right? #OZSC #SFOR #AITX #ALPP #EEMF"
Of course it would sit mid $70s when I have $80/70 Put spreads expiring today. I thought for sure that it would be below $60 today and the bid/ask would tighten and I would be able to collect the full $1k per contract. I guess I got greedy like the Bulls did on the way up.
Have you had enough coupon clipping yet?

Me when I cash in my 2/19 $20 puts
Fair value for Game Stop is $10 per share. Just look at the valuation of Best Buy that has far better prospects (0.63 x ttm revenue). GME with it's declining revenue should not justify more than 0.5 x revenue. Really 0.25 x revenue with all its troubles ($5 per share). 3 days of 50%-plus declines will mercifully end the misery for remaining bag-holders.
In 30 min we see which way the wind blows. A lot of people fearful to hold over the weekend but Wall Street has a way of surprising everyone.
Interesting how that same 99 year old woman is still standing in the doorway at Walmart after a year of the deadliest pandemic in known to man
This stock is moving back quickly to its fundamental price rather than an emotional pump. This trade is over.
Here we go... $150
let's go boys
I'm done shorting this stock....What is the good entry point for the day?
Most people bought below 100$ so MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL HOLDING!! So most of us are willing to be squeezed until the end of time. And once the restriction of limits is removed WE ARE FLYING. YOLO
paperhanded yesterday.. i've confidence now this is gonna rise back up crazy next week. bought back in!
Hold your shares!There aren't any Real shares available just the naked ones going back and forth to lower the ticker.If they had us beat why are they ALL on here telling us to sell???We have them just hold!
TIMBER
Elon tweeted Gamestonk
There's no reason to ever shop at GameStop.I've been a gamer for 35+ years and never bought anything at GME.
Is it too late to buy GME? is the party over?
back to 80s you can do it
this is the landlord and holding company for $AMC i believe it is a group of $gme diamonds scooping up failing companies flipping them and owning the land of these failing brick and mortars. if us Genxers taught our kids anything was ingenuity $imax $tmus $atnf $epr $sndl $nakd $grnq
#gme and #amc. It's getting up! To the moon!
-50%... To the moon!!
you know melvin just made back half their losses or more by now
"they released some bullish news today, and coupled with actual long investors, the squeeze is about to go big time"
Tomorrow will be a consistent of￼
How long to keep at these levels to create another short squeeze?
Maybe in the 50's by end of trading today. Hope no one here is in at triple digits.
"Who bought up at 95 ???? Ouch 40% hit in a day. That hurts and right before the weekend. The smart ones sold today.. next week not so nice, sorry for your luck."
I bought at 140 pre market. Should I keep holding?
"When you allow retail investors to only sell, and buy 1 (or none) of a stock for days, that's getting ""$GaME'd"".The people playing the game at the top didn't like us figuring out the rules, so they changed them. What will come next is regulation, while they point at retail investors and social media to hide their naked shorting."
Like it we can get to $40 today
Not selling we like the stonk 
Yahoo reported GME down -12% in Frankfurt to scare paper hands as I guess 
Buy the dip!

"Just bought 3000 shares.....ya know... ""for the cause"""
"I know you, you not holding."
anyone has an authentic news regarding GME??? No fake news please.
I’m not a basher as most in here are robots or shorter or hedge funds bookies .. they shorted more that the stocks available 140% at the beginning. They need all the stocks to close. Again sell your stocks at the prices you like .. they are scaring you so you can sell cheaper this is why they are not buying all and paying interests. Still expensive but they think they can make some options here and there so they can reduce their loses .. sell your stock at the price you like it’s 1000 for me screw them
GME will explode at least 50% back after hours thanks to AMAZON earnings after hours. Shorties will cry again. I will buy more if pulldown. I will buy AAPL if pulldown or AMZN . shorties will cry start with Cramer. AMAZON and AAPL will help GME after hours. buy buy
Hold

"When I look at the Short % of outstanding then it is 21%, if I look at $GME then it is around 88%. I thought these numbers was much higher like 80% and 120%. Is there something wrong with the % in the statistics or do I not understand them correct?"

GME MOON DANCE LOLOLOL
So set sell limit at $2000 now?
Who wants to do to the Moon????
Feds are studying in detail what happened with this stock. Stock manipulation charges and law suits are probably coming.
buy SNDL
"yep , I added too. GME at 89.20 , AAPL at 135.08 and AMZN at 3396.20 . I can not be wrong. AMAZON , AAPLE beat on earnings partially due to game software and hadrware. Gamesstop should correct huge along with AAPL,AMZN. Buy and accumulate, you will see"
CNBC market volatility:-Market volatility definition:- if go down volatility increaseGME stock:- if it does not go down then it is volatile.Just watch and they have GME volatile again. Yesterday 60% drop wasn't volatility for them but today 1% up is volatile.

thank you for allowing all of america to learn what a short ladder looks like on a stock chart
"I feel sorry for those who have now lost their college money, their house money their lunch money. I have been there, done that. Short squeezes do not last forever. Nor is there now ""consolidation"" or ""a base"" being formed. Short term stocks are a voting machine. Last week everyone voted mania. Now everyone is voting panic. In a month or two the scales will show, that the panic is well warranted. This company is not making money. It is losing money rapidly. It really doesnt matter in the short term who is in charge. Nor how hard they wave their hands and say buy buy buy. Yes, this stock may go back up again IF management are incredibly adept and light on their feet. But I will say this after many many years of investing: This stock will see $10 a share long long before it sees $100 a share (if ever). The best thing you can do is get what you can recover (before it hits 10 or below), take your losses like a man, learn from your painful lesson, promise yourself never to repeat it, and move on. I wish you well."
Keep calm and buy more! Panic selling is over..... time to rally
"Robinhood is partly responsible for the quick fall of this stock but now that trade restrictions are removed by Robinhood, there are no more excuses. Let's see what you got Wallstreetbets fans."
I wonder who bought this at $480
"Can’t stop, won’t stop, GameStop. Diamonds hands to the moon!"
"I can't in my right mind find a scenario this jumps back even to 100. Short interest is down over 50% from last week, newbie retail investors are going broke, the big boys are slithering back in. Sounds like game over for the bulls."
"Amazing. Stay in the market. Don't worry about the Wall Street gangsters. A lot of you buying GME and AMC are our kids and grandkids. If the baby boomers get mad at the Fund managers , we will pull our money out . Then they will have a real problem. Happy trading!!!!!"
I will sell you my shares after you are done buying back all of the shares you borrowed to short this. Deal?
Not bad down 235 points in two days keep pumping it
Hope you got it on the dip and didn't fall for wall street scheme.
So many SEC laws violated by dirty funds. They will eventually get caught. They will pay through the nose. And those who held will reap the rewards.
1 share purchases don't move markets. It's all about option sellers earning the volatility premium when it disappears and hedging with appropriate buy/sold shares. Both call and put buyers will be the ones holding the bag along with the 1 share stockholders.

"It’s tanking because all these so called “Diamond Hands” people are selling all their shares and leaving you with the bag. The big holders already cashed out and secured their money. This is going to be $60s in the next few mins and keep going lower. Don’t let others play Russian Roulette with your money, think for yourself. Sell this tanker and get into something where you can recover your losses easily like NAKD which I put my money in yesterday, it went from $0.90 to $1.30 already is projected to reach $3-$5."
holding strong we will see 200 today.
Ultimate Bull Thesis:I Like The Stock.
Gme to the moon!!!!
Holding strong... This is the tactic to lure us for panic sell...do not fall for it... Their interest in short selling is lower than them buying the shares back at a higher price. So let's HOLD....
The fact that I immediately get thumbs down is reassuring. I’ve seen this before - 2009 bank stocks. If you lost in $GME or $AMC sell now and buy $XLE $OXY $ET and $GEL. Oil is $56. These companies are cash flow machines. You’ll get dividends and capital appreciation. You can make your money back.If you’ve gained big in $TSLA - do the same. You’ll make even more.

Also, we dont want any of those called ""Diamond hands here"" because you all saw what happend to $amc turd stock and $gme. Better keep those gambling rocket and lambo kiddos FAR away from this stock. Steady and easy is the way to do it. All those insane 100% pumps are bad for the stock and attrack those WSB kiddo and Diamond hands losers who sell when the stock drops 10%Steady and easy. Today i think we can close at 1,12-1,18 level. Lets hope we can keep her flat AH and sideways tommorow.. maybe friday we can push this to 2 dollars and then next week i see 2,60-2,90 as a good PT.Hold on people. Much love."
Keep buying people. Going up!

"I borrowed $32,000 on my credits cards to buy GME. 500 shares ... to the moon!!"
"buying a few shares at open... OK with any loss less than 10% here, expecting short bloodbath Friday.. but who knows?"
To those who bought today...
"GameStop grabbed headlines after a coordinated effort by retail investors to squeeze short sellers caused the stock to surge multiple times. It has lost more than 80% of those gains in recent days, but despite that has still added about $5.1 billion in value this year. I always seemed to miss my buy and sell points. Until I found this platform that seems to help out. https://daytradingsquad.team/TrueTradingGroup"
"Buying here, wish me luck"
stop losses at $75 have left the chat
Shorts right now:
No idea why you guys wouldn’t sell when it peaked? If blockbuster didn’t make it through why would this company make it? I hope a lot of you guys took profit. I feel sorry for the ones that was bullish on this trash stock.
I feel bad for the people fighting it all the way down. Gonna lose it all.
"You need more than Robin Hood to help you. You need Superman, Batman, Aquaman, Captain America and it still won't help you. GME is over."
"Lmfao halted again , hedges are weak"
Bought more just today. I did my part. Need to push it higher.
Bot activity high. Short desperation is high. Good signs. I’ll keep holding
Still holding my blockbuster shares Doh!!!!
"The only reason Robinhood and others lifted restrictions is that now the hedgefunds have covered their shorts, so anything we do now is moot. Even if there's margin calls to the hedges they've already made bets on the other side of the aisle to cover their losses. Watch The Big Short over and over until you get it."
If the squeeze was not last friday when will it be?
Lmao how are you doing young bucks ;). What’s is it again “ hold the line “. Yell it for me.
Itlll be $6 by Monday
I'm guessing it's a good time to buy a few shares...why not
you guys really showed those hedge funds.
"I am down $4k all my money, what do I do ?"
"hedge funds are trying their hardest to short ladder $AMC and $GME. Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to!Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond.These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!"
Mark Cuban literally said hold.
"They need to restrict access to the stock market, maybe make an account threshold of 50k or 75k something.So people getting stimulus checks cannot turn around and pump the market."
If you actually buy this tomorrow I’m just gonna assume you also buy those coins on tv at 4am
if this was really gonna fall then people wouldn't go out of their way to come to this board and post bearish comments. I feel sorry for some of you
Holy Titanic Batman!!!!!!
"Michael Burry was not belived when he said the housing market was going down, do you know what he did? He HOLD with those beautiful "
HOLD THE LINE!!!!!
The TREND is your FRIEND... until the END! Get out while you can. Any bounces off the bottom at this point is just day traders trading a temporary bottom. The Trend is down way down.
You guys are amazing keep holding!!!!
impressive bounce
You GME holders are like the band on the Titanic! Just keep playing as the boat sinks!
If everyone held tight the stock price would be at 500. Reddit is tempary. This stock is going down. No sales or earnings to give it hope.
From $483 to $83 many people have a lot of explaining to do to their espouse. This reminds me of TLRY a couple of years ago. From $300 to the current price. Pray for a miracle.
"squeeze is real, HOLD"
Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope is not investing.
"Please sell all your ticket when it hits 100 again, I'm not bot or hired guy to damage your all, this is my truly pure advise for you all, I hope you all have some earnings in this but don't hold for too long just because of your greed are overtaking it"
Odd how there were no halts when it was on its way down.
"When will they stopped the short laddet attacks?And starting to buy back? if they can, i think the strong hands holding"
otw back to $400
"Well this up and down price action makes it easy to make a couple of thousand. Thanks, I can use 2000 bucks."
Wake up. The squeeze was 400-500 price. I’m down 20k because I didn’t close as I thought it would go higher..
Just bought in for the first time. Was big in AMC. Let’s ride.
Tread lightly. Smart money tends to win. Don't bother shorting either. This volatility is not for the faint of heart.
"5:56p ET 2/2/2021 - BenzingaPopeyes Offering Free Tendies For GameStop Shareholders And Everyone ElseMentioned:AMC GME NOKA large restaurant chain is getting in on the fun with a clever wordplay capturing retail traders versus hedge fund story that took over the stock market over the past two weeks.What Happened: Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is hoping to gain some additional customers and fans through a timely promotion featuring some of the hottest stocks on the market.The company, owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE: QSR), is offering free chicken tenders for customers on its app.'Tendies aren't for the elite few. They're for everyone,' the promotion reads in a nod to tendies being a slang term for gains or profits to traders.Users can get the free tendies by using any of the stock related codes of $GME, $AMC, $NOK or $BB. The codes refer to GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK) and BlackBerry (NYSE: BB)."
Pump and dump strategy is going on now!!! Play safe people!!! Don't hurt yourself!!! It's your money!!!
Another Elon tweet about meme stocks destroyer of shorts..lmao
"If the short interest data is being manipulated, which is also a real possibility and If Congress does any real digging when it holds hearings on the GameStop situation, it will uncover some very interesting quirks of the market, many of them revolving around shorting practices."
"Been reading lots of posts. RARELY, do I read about GME's fundamentals or business future. I keep reading about, Shares outstanding, Short Sales, Trends, etc.... Reminds me of card counters at a Blackjack table. Using mathematical logic of pieces of paper trading and not the underlying company. THIS IS NOT INVESTING, but gambling. Good luck to you all, but my guess.... GME will settle around $15 - $20 and stay there. Result... Loads of crying gamblers and lots of smart early entry pyramid schemers."
Sad business - a lot of people made fortunes from poor honest people just hoping for an easy break.
"Don't forget to reload buys, and get them on the dip (if there is one). We're still up 15% today."
bought 10 shares letsgo
"Hedge Funds are still shorting like crazy!The biggest hedge fund shorts of $GME and $AMC, per fintel.io:Per SEC filing on 2/2, Hedge Fund Simplex Trading, Llc had a short position of 1.997 million $AMC shares, and 9,421 put(short) options(Each option is 100 shares), representing a 27.85% and a 183.94% increase respectively compared to their previous position. That's equivalent to shorting around 3 million $AMC shares.Simplex Trading, Llc also had 4.847 million shares of $GME short position, and 2,547 put(short) options, roughly equivalent to 5.1 million $GME shares short.On 2/4(yesterday):$GME: Among 62,213,000 market volume, 46% were shorted$AMC: Among 162,147,400 market volume, 55% were shortedPlease upvote to let this post stick!"
Congrats to all who bought below 60$
"To all the WSB fanatics.... why? I bought at $36.75, sold at $290, bought puts when it bounced over $300, and will sell those somewhere below $50, at which point I'll buy stock and sit and wait for the RC turnaround story to unfold. That's how you play the stock market. You made your point and hurt the hedge funds already, now come back to reality and start thinking for yourselves again."
WSB got these suits by the BALLZZ I don't know why Wallstreet and the Media isn't honest but they have to come up with BILLIONS to cover! They don't have it! We are talking billions of dollars here from several hedge funds. Robinhood restricted buyers to lower the price. Basically they're PHHHHUCCD! WSB this is going to $1000 and it will be the greatest short squeeze of all time.
1000 dollar share here we gooo
gme is being shorted just like Tesla was.Tesla skyrocketed after all.
Lunchtime bounce Shorts have not even covered yet Algorithms magic!
"halted, yesterday when was falling no halts, hedge funds and system work together against real investors"
"All these haters trollin the boards so hard. Actin as if they KNOW what's gonna happen lol. Grow up and start supporting others. Why would you want someone to lose? We're all in it together. The truth is, the market is extremely unpredictable. Your guess is as good as mine. I'm not expecting this stock to go up anymore. But I'm rooting for you holders!! To the mooon!!!!"

We are ready to bust out, but needs your help to break the last barriers. Please stand together and support SENS on Monday. This is innovative CGM Technology that will replace MEDTRONIC, ABBOTT AND DEXCOM in 2 or 3 years. Your help is needed for Senseonic Holdings to prosper for the next decades. Thank you Comrades!"
1k tomorrow
Millionaires
How much money is being wasted by Market Makers to take down a stock? SEC wake up. Quit letting Big money steal from retail.
GME is angry today...85 to 97 within one min.
Remember when this was above $250 4 days ago?
"20% up today, and people are saying ”sell” LOL! Feeling the squeeze yet? Is the margin call sloowly creepin’ closer? Cover the short, before it’s to late! I’m LONG, 1K next stop "
The squeeze will come one way or another. Either by removing all restrictions for retail traders or by the hedge funds cannibalizing each other.
Did they halt this again?
My portfolio is doing good.
it's ez to be  hands when you're deep in the red
Proud holder!!
"GameStop in AMC went up at the same time, and our dropping big-time at the same time"

Im telling y’all by next week
People are expecting a first round knockout. This is going to be a twelve round back and forth war. Stay strong.
SHORTS ARE REALLY WORKING HARD NOW
Holding the line
"Why did Robinhood need an injection of $3 billion? Likely because THEY were the counter-party that was short GME during the short-squeeze. WSB traders wanted to ""stick it to the man"" -- but they didn't realize ""the man"" was the broker taking their trades! Watch what happens to their accounts if Robinhood goes bankrupt!"
Bag holders better get themselves some tents... Might be camping out for the next couple years 
PAPER HANDS TAKING A LIL PROFIT DONT BUG. WERE HITTING 100 by close
serious advice: stop bagholding this hoping for a squeeze that already happened. there is much better and safer opportunity right now than hoping a $15 stock will go to $500 again.
"Before the Squeeze run up, over the past six months, the stock had made its own positive run from around $5 to over $20. This rise was based on improved outlook, led by Ryan Cohen. I saw many different analysts projecting reduced costs, increased online sales, and a vision by Mr Cohen to challenge Amazon in the burgeoning video game business. None of that has changed. Wait for Feb 9th release of up-to-date Short Interest. The number is still extremely high, with new shorts replacing former ones. This, with the return to a normal looking share price, nothing has changed. It's still a good long-term investment, and still presents a great chance at another short Squeeze. The single biggest reason the Squeeze was aborted, was the buying restrictions by Robinhood. Sign up with a new brokerage firm, and let's proceed."
"GME will pump big time today and next week. Buckle up, we are about to go back to $420"
"MS: ""Fund managers are going to send a huge message to Robinhood on Monday. One they won't forget, ""We are in charge of the markets."""
"Elon Musk has just declared himself Destroyer of Shorts on twitter, you do the math."

All the panic sellers now are Bears as well 
Heavily manipulated by brokerages who should be sued bigly. Not a holder of this stock but party is clearly over.
GameStop should offer a dividends and make the shorts pay them.

Onwards and upwards fingers crossed some sort of momentum going
Follow chart it don’t lie
"Reddits fans.. you have no idea what you're up against.. if you can sell for profit, great. If you have to bail out and preserve money you have left, you learned an expensive lesson. GME is not worth today's price and until it's like $4/share.. there's not justification for its share price. Sorry to break that news to you... I'm not a Short and I don't own any Puts but I should own Puts."
"TOO FUNNY. ALL THE ""LEADERS"" OF THE REDDIT BROTHERHOOD CASHED OUT AND LEFT THE MINIONS TO ""HOLD""."

This GME disaster looks like the failure of educational system. People gambling big time on the base of nothing.. And without even knowing it!
Down exactly 135 points today what are the odds ?
Typical Robinhooder trying to process what just happened
"According to hedge funds.They already profited a sht ton.However, for some reason they aren’t walking away?Is it because their goal hasn’t been achieved?Must be because of Diamond hands"
On the NYSE short restriction list beginning tomorrow AM!!!!
Serious Question. I just bought 100 shares in afterhours for the purpose of selling calls. But when I try to put an order to sell 1 call for tomorrow's expiration -- the order got rejected by TDAmeritrade saying -- underlying is hard to borrow. Why would TDA prevent me from selling a covered --since i bought the underlying?? Appreciate any insights. Thanks
Trading HALTED!!! Shenanigans!!!!
Up big tomorrow!
"Still holding, no matter what shorts & hedges try to do.Will sell at $1k. Whatever happens inbetween, I don't give a CNN."
They are pumping this and they allowed full trading. Purpose is to lure in new buyers so that they can dump again.
Many brokers now have to allow their clients to buy GME - FYI
"This is a solid stock long term hold stock, but got dragged down due to $GME and $AMC hype effect LOL"
bye bye longs

Diamond hands boys

Let RobinHooders Trade!!!!
It's amazing how fast diamond hands turn to jelly when the losses start mounting
Remember the good old days when GME was over $300? LOL!Thanks.
How to spot a bot/intern. They use GIFs. They use generic first names. They convince you to sell. They insult you for holding. Just down vote them and move. They are used by Hedgies and those who want the stock to tank (they are betting on the short).
"These young GME Bernie Sanders MOB social justith warriorthz are gettin' their back ends ripped wide open and chomped on by the ravishing Wall Street hungry ruthless Hyenas lols. Looks like you'll all have to stop that $2 a month drip campaign to commie leader Bernie, hold off on order that new skate board, and scale back your online gaming for years to cover these losses you've lost already lol. Bwaaaahaha!Chomp chomp chomp there goes more of your WRECKTUMS haha. Bye bye commies, see at your next antifa mob tantrum and riot."
Who wishes they sold the puts yesterday
What’s up with all these exact closes without cents
Big Squeeze will launch  when GME drops 30% today
Just Billy ...
If this drops to $70 i’m all in
tanking is cool.. going up slowly it halts every 10 minutes lol
"Stock still over valued, business wasn't doing well that's why it was shorted, maybe a little too much but that's why ethical shorts do- and curious as to what are their plans since they bought on Ryan Cohen from Chewy. Seems like no plans.(chuckle)"
Nice symmetrical 2 week chart for GME! Usually going down is a lot faster than going up.
In at 130 ..........LFG!
Gamestop should come out and say they believe stock going up because they report 300%+ growth in eCommerce. How that CNBC will like?
"So Let's get this Straight, we got Stock here that has a Current Enterprise Value/EBITDA of minus 78.45, that on it's BEST day has a Price/Sales of 0.05, Price/Book is 0.61, and a Enterprise Value/Revenue that equals 1.04. That means it is Worth..."
Put prices are saying $50 close tomorrow. Check for yourselves.
"When does this hit $1,000?"
get in now before it back over70!
hedgies really out here paying minimum wage salaries for paid bashers to post? don't the hedies know they're gunna be bankrupt within 2 weeks?

Why would anyone sell if there down this much. Better off holding and try make money on other stocks while they wait for it go back up
Bought 15 shares at 142 wish me luck
Robinhood investors right now:
GameStop game soon will end. How many of you have lost thousands because you were waiting for bigger payday. My guess under `$75 by end of week
Shorts spamming the dislike button like they can make a difference
Only buy what you afford ! If you can not afford do not buy!

"I feel Bullish for a trade. I think as Trader very well known this is going up Short Term...As a Trader I expect a significant short term rise. However, I would think again Long-term. Good Luck To All."
dont worry guys this wont go down today if it does i make money and i always lose so get your call bets in asap lol
Still waiting on those who bought weekly Puts or shorted at the open.

GME dilute: print more GME shares for sale + Insiders are taking profits before GME drop back to its true value of $10/s.
"Pumpers don't cry when your Landlord evicts you because you spent your stimulus check on GME.Remember it is first come, first serve at your local shelter. Get there early."
Just know if your money is gone .. it’s long gone from now .. the chances of getting it back are super low . There isn’t enough fuel to boost this up pass $200. Rocket is out of fuel and many are aborting mission . Let this be a lesson learned from many of you ￼

"I am a conservative investor , I never buy by the rumor and never sell it short...."
So sorry guys.... I realize this has been a PAINFUL LESSON for newbies to experience.I have been in the markets since the mid 90's. I seen things come and go. GameStomp is ..................GONE
"Fri. couldn't get it to 300, yesterday neither, today worse. Jokes on someone and don't think it's on the HF anymore- NYSE has stopped short traders from shorting it temporarily, so they are not in this game."
"Cut losses early today if u can , don’t make it worst for urself"
The short interest has dropped a lot. It took a lot of volume for this to even get to 90. If it was during the short squeeze time it would’ve been at 200 but it took so much volume and it didn’t do much and went back down. GLTA but this ain’t getting over 100 again. Better to buy puts
"Short Sellers just don't get it. Cover your positions upto 20% of float (so thats about 93% of shares repurchasing) and move on. Thats the only way this ends. Forget the $20B, dont try to make it back. Its gone. Just go back to a 9 to 5 job and close up those hedge funds."
Were going up!!!!
Sell and buy 20 shares to your 1 of NOK... a company that makes great products and growing profits. Just saying!
Look at the $INO day chart and see how big boys manipulate stocks. Nasty dumping 5 minutes before the market closes. Short interest has increased to 55%. And this is legal?$AMC $GME $NOK
This should be back to it's fair valuation of $10 by next week if not earlier.
Half you guys are pumpers and the other half actually think this business is worth $100. Trying to figure out who I feel worse for.
Elon Musk just took back his words on GME = GME will go below $10 as before he joined the game.Game is over! Time to get back to your business.
Why is trading sideways ?!!!
Wouldn't it be funny if the hedge funds that have been shorting the hell out of GME since last Thursday all went long and are going to pump the price to new highs to make $ both ways?
What ever the manipulators are doing both gme and amc have the almost identical chart— it’s obvious the same ladder shorting is going on
$1400 Stimulus Checks Approved! Mine is going all-in on GME. APES TOGETHER STRONG.

There’s a buying opportunity coming just not sure if it’s at $66 or $6
"pushing back down again. Once breaks $70, will be heading to 60$ very quickly...Then repeat down to $50.Might be able to hold above $50 today still, but will be below $60.Day traders want to get their money out before weekend."
"Collapsing ah now lol, enjoy $35 Monday open. Thanks."
Can the same thing happen with Tesla stock??
How many fake shares are the funds trading. SEC investigate.
$100 today
"Do not believe the news of the short interest being covered. That is absolute manipulation. Everybody can see that it hasn't. Nobody knows the current live short interest, no one, not even the SEC, it would break the market. Short interest is only reported at intervals, not broadcasted live. Look at how they say the date is ""complied"" by so and so, it is totally made up. Not even a bberg terminal knows the true short interest. Hold."
Good entery price I will take my chance with 100 share to start
Bought another 5k i believe in people
SLS with so few shares could see $200 a share on news. Rising already over 120% since 40 min before close yesterday and 45 min into trading today. A split is bound to happen as share price sky rockets. $GME $BB $AMC $MRNA
Following reddit pumpers will lead to your demise.Do some DD - know what you are buying.It's folly to invest money to try to honor the memory of Hugo Chavez.
Diamond Hands -- HOLD. No one know what the true share shorts are. People are speculating. Next week we will know Finra figures. I think the short ratio is still very high and next week -- when Finra figures come out and we know the volume short -- then this will fly again.... a new rally to new highs....i think.
Strong support at $4.17
The very worst thing to happen to you is to win first time I. Las Vegas

"Next week will rise to $800, huge amount, and lots of call option volume, short squeeze again next week."
Looks like GME is going back to the moon
Now it's your time to get in... its time.. this is why we held.

Get out and cut your losses. this is going to fair market value which is about $6.00 per share.
Sorry to the millions of people who got screwed by Reddit/WallStreet/Day Trader Scammers. They set you up to push this stock to values beyond reality and cashed out.
Brothers and sisters. Shorts are crying for our shares in amc . Buy and hold and let them cry . Let them cry like the way they illegally stopped us from trading and locked our hands and lost so much money
"This is far from over, still many shorts need to be covered, hold and buy the dip"
"Still up %1000 in 6 months, thanks for the great start to 2021. reinvested profits in safe dividends and cut atleast 4 years off my career"

They want our shares we aint selling. Yellen better be giving us $10k a share
All you “diamond hands” when GME goes volatile. 
"NYU’s ‘Dean of Valuation’: GameStop would have to fall to $30 to be fairly pricedPUBLISHED WED, FEB 3 20212:01 PM EST(This story is for CNBC Pro subscribers only.)New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran told CNBC on Wednesday he believes GameStop has more room to fall before it reaches what he considers a fair valuation."
Can we sue CNBC saying Gamestop volatile again?Because they are lying in real definition term. Are they running code language and helping Hedge fund cordinate attack?No angle this is volatility. This is 1000 time less volatility then yesterday.
"The amount of huge float right now on margin, indicates 437 at close today. Those buying in now are making the money"
hahaha imagine the people who bought at 300 and sold at 86

"61.67mil Shorted Shares, Short Ratio: 2.1 so ~2 . For every share “traded” two are shorted"
Really tho. Why did it stop trading?
"I own puts and believe this is going to zero eventually...but I am concerned over longs not selling and losing their money. If you bought in low, consider at least selling some so you profit overall. I have been on both sides and I hate seeing people lose money."
"Why don't ALL of the SHORTS just get out, then the game will be over? This will drop like a rock as the Reddit players have no one on the other side. GME can't go higher unless the bag holders want to follow orders from Cuban."
closing over 200 today. buybuybuy
I got in at 250$ should I still hold my shares? Will this go back up again?
Hold people hold. Then buy some more.

GME is not oversold enough. Today it was never been halted. But it will happen tomorrow. FEAR stands forF Everything And Run.
By Monday $125
"Good day bag holders but the end is coming, charts don't lie"
Now for the “why did I sell at $50?!? “ And next week “why didn’t I average in “...who knows that’s my guess and not financial advice
MARGIN CALLS 
the profits will come when you force them to cover. they will have to pay for the high prices stop selling amongst yourselves
Don't listen to all the shills telling you to sell. HOLD! If you lost 80%of your money no point in selling. HOLD AND WIN BIG.
Now what?
"How exactly did reddit get duped into not taking profits anyway? You are supposed to sell at 480, 380 etc and buy on massive dips and do it again....and then again.... Not just hold it for a week lol."
Don't blame Robinhood. They saved you from losing even more money. Here is where the money went: Nine Investors Instantly Make $16 Billion On GameStop Stock 'Squeeze'
"The ""good thing"" about this GME sheet show is that now all the day trading Robinhood kiddies have enough capital loss carryover to last them for the next 10 years!"
"Look at the vol!Trading back and forth, Hold!!"
50 points to go to the end
The time to buy is the day after the volume is below 5MM shares. Not today!
"Bought GME, not selling... Diamond Hands here."
"SIRC+73.5416%Updated Wed, February 3, 2021, 5:41 AM·3 min readMore content belowSIRC+73.5416%Company Receives Tesla-Certified Installer StatusEL CAJON, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 3, 2021 /Solar Integrated Roofing Corp.

That was me that drove GME to 92 I bought a half a share.
"It's ok bag holders. Burger King has expanded their $1.00 menu. You can still eat, at least."
it's over
Wait for the short report to come out.....
brothers support amc with 10 shares now
"What is it about the GME business model that has you investing?I'm all for sticking it to The Man, but come on."
"WSB wanted only the best from you, your money. Retail investor revolution my a...ss,GME was the biggest pyramide scam system in Wallstreet History and left a lot of Newbies broke and in the dust.I wrote few days back when Stock was 140 and falling hard if GME breaks 100 first bottom will be at 35-36 USD. Can not count how many pumper attacked me. Some people don't want to hear the truth.It's not rocket science, in 99% of the cases after a short squeeze Stock comes back to his original value before the pump and that was 4 USD. WSB bought it at 4 and sold it to all the Robin Hood Sheep for above 450.They are laughing all the way to the bank. Instead of crying about Robin Hood and other brokers people should thank them. They saved a lot of newbies of going broke."
"$MVIS is on the verge of short squeeze. Hidenburg is caught on squeeze., Heading to $30 in a week, imo."
85-90 pm Monday then up it goes
Robinhood is done for sure
"the reason it went from $400 down to $50 is because most smart Reddit people are all gone, you are the only one left to hold the bag."
"One thing is clear, u need to screw Robinhood. They r responsible for it's fall and many others.The brokers r all working for hedge, n raise margings or limit trades be it Ameritrade, Schawb or Robinhood."
"I have no skin in this game, but this is over if you think there's a squeeze coming. Get out now while you still have something."
"Stop telling people to ""hold"", what you are saying essentially, is ""HOLD THE BAG!"""
"I jumped in today at 55$ @20 for first time. maby i lose all my mony i had,i don't know why i did.but wanna be in the game.good luck everyone."
"It’s like Mark Cuban just said earlier today on WSB, this likely ain’t over for AMC and $GME. When RH stopped taking buy orders last Thursday that is what caused this drop and also more shorts piled into the stocks. Once these buy orders are lifting or people switch to a broker that can handle their buy orders we will see at least one more surge. If you can afford to hold then HOLD!!!"
Several hedge funds are stuck BILLIONS of dollars I mean BILLIONS of dollars! I don't know why the media is down playing this but they still haven't covered! But when they do it will cause a massive spike. You could wake up and the stock be up $300 then spiking to $1000 this is not over. We are looking at a double squeeze beyond squeeze!
226% shorted... HOLD
"Take your money out and invest it in good stocks with a bright future. Not everyone in GME will be/can be winners. Be cautious, many of those saying they have diamond hands have already cashed out."
GME Holder
YOLO HOLD!!!
Hand to Hand COMBAT Stock Market Trading Lession #1
The internet should heal pretty quick once redditors have to pawn their pc for ramen
"$AMC and $GME charts are IDENTICAL, the fight IS NOT OVER, wich means, WE ARE HOLDING, AND WINNING!!"
Can you cover short during pre and aftermarket?
Don't even own a share of GME but I've been waiting to see this moment
GME HOLDERS BY 9:35AM EST
"This day was so heavily shorted, that the end-of-day short cover will be MASSIVE"
This volume yesterday and today is NOT HF's or short sellers...it is simply day traders...literally thousands of traders trading this stock back and forth.
"i was on the mara ride and never thought another ride like that again, this time I found an egen better one $sos for the RICH PEOPLE!$amc $gme $mara $riot $btbt $ftft $hive"
Trading in Europe started. High 50’s
"Congrats you know who won...the ten guys @ WSB who had positions established before they provoked you all, and the lucky ones who were holding beforehand, that were smart enough to sell. Notice hedge funds got cash infusions, and played the other side selling options (collecting the the volatility and time premiums at top dollar) while you all bought it up. No cash infusions for you, just dispursements. Play follow the leader and this is what you get...if someone told you jump of a bridge...would you do it?"
Game over !
What’s the reason for the halts?
I told u all 50 than open today $22... than $2
My cousin who watches WWE and has a green molar says hold
I don't know how old is the data from Yahoo. Here are some data on Gamestop27.33% % of Shares Held by All Insider122.04% % of Shares Held by Institutions167.96% % of Float Held by Institutions
This stock is heaven for experienced day traders. Look at the pattern
gme in 2 days back to normal $13
Eager retail caught once again on PM pump. The professionals buy late in the day.
I refuse to sell! I'm going to HOLD to the bitter end.
"Today was a dead cat bounce. Monday it will continue up - I suggest sell all if it hits 68... By next Friday this will be in the 30s. Historically, stocks like this that have had astronomical increases eventually have 50% drop PER WEEK until back to its mean average, which today is about $8. Use technically charting. It clearly shows the breath - highs and lows. 3 months from now GME will be back to $4 and long forgotten. My point: preserve capital as soon as possible."
MY ADVICE IS SELL AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE GME IS GOING BACK TO TRU VALE AT $5.00
Please advice: I am a college student and I am tempted to use my FAFSA money to buy 50 share. Should I do it ? Please help
"Simple transfer of wealth, some people made alot of money while others lost alot of money...welcome to trading. Honestly anyone who bought above $100 is the same person who buys lottery tickets... gambling 101"
"Almost feel bad for the inexperienced investors who bought high and are now going to have to sell low, but that's what happens when you listen to pumpers, biggest winners in this were probably the millionaires who joined in the bull run at the right time"
The train wreck is approaching this thing is about to tank.
Get your stock certificate from your broker. I will someday be a collectors item
I'd really like to know why GME didn't follow AMC's lead and issue shares when the price was peaking to pay off debt. Seemed like a no brainer.
"in case y'all haven't figured it out, the shorts are once again shorting this stock along with some former longs."
Impressive! Make sure to buy into the bargain price post market.
"We jumped from 77 to 152 in no time, we can bounce back as long as we hold and RH and others allow unlimited buying of GME stock again. They will throw everything at us in the following days, from distractions to full-blown lies about covered shorts and the end of the squeeze. Hold strong"
"The support and resistance is unbelievable, where does this go today everyone? Imo green will be the colour of the day with swings and increased volatility with green close at 85 -90;"
If he is holding I am holding. Because we like this stock!
So now it’s rising same pattern for the most part even blocks 100 shares going up in just fractional cents— the statistical likelihood of that is impossible
"HOW'S THE STONKS, KIDS? ARE WE RICH YET?"

"I usually dont trust premarket action, but currently the volume is decent enough to conclude that a green open is most probable"
GME BOOMMMM!!!STOCK MARKET GURUS:WALL STREET 2021.....On F...B.....
Brotherhood is now allowing their clients to buy GME guys so who ever shorted from $480 down must cover today and that's why you saw GME was up nearly $9 earlier and like a hour ago.
The people remaining... The short squeeze has already ended. People trying to prop this up are like you hoping it will go back up... But just because you hope for something isn't going to change this going back to the price of a month ago. This is a horrible stock. I am legitimately sorry for the people who didn't listen to me 4-5 days ago.
"I exited around 90 yesterday for a tiny profit of 80% in a bit more than a weeks time. Not a bad trade looking from outside on it, but it stings that I didn't take profit over 200. Oh well, lots of lessons learned."
Reddit had teamed up with multi millionaries and its all over thier stream their going to LONG this after hrs
"I bought at 380, when I going to see that value again?"
52 Week Range 2.57 - 483.00 The people in this mob that drove up the share price through manipulation are now complaining about the stock price being manipulated because they bought high and are now forced to sell low. At some point fundamentals will come into play.
"I do believe we might see 100$ today, maybe 140$"
"Traders at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are probably ordering the new EV Porsche,with their massive profits on both sides of the trade."

All the brokerages & RobinHood will take off GME restrictions soon and $300
Next week : 65 -> 110 -> 80 -> 40 -> 10agree?
You can manipulate around the fundamentals but sooner or later they will prevail. This is a $10 or lower stock.
KHRNF. Look at this one break out. STILL a chance to make some serious $$$. Volume spiking. I'm not a bot. See post history.
THANK YOU WALL STREET for the FIRE SALE on this GREAT STONK
What is GME doing as a company to boost your confidence as investors?
Short Sellers Accounts ... Again ...
Shorts right bow
Good luck but it’s not gonna b $$$ day
"Remember the predictions I have provided here and then,TimT13 days ago Replied to a reaction$AAL conversation""And here comes some more speculation based on the original post! - AAL’s share price may exceed the median value of $15.90 after the stock market resumes its activities on 1/28.- AAL’s share price may retreat in the following week after the Q4 earnings. The possible price decline is expected to be between -6.6% and -14%.- The level of volatility suggests that AAL’s share price declined -6.6% (based on the closing price of the week) or as much as 9.3%(the lowest price AAL shares were traded) in the following week after the Q2 earnings. AAL's share price dropped -8.7%(based on the closing price of the week) or as much as -14%(the lowest price AAL shares were traded) after the Q3 earnings.""So they all came out true.I had written weekly and biweekly covered calls on my all AAL long position. I didn't want to lose the stocks but it's in a way nice to know that I am able kept the premiums and the shares for the weekly calls. The next week's covered calls are insured for just over $19. Based on the trend in the previous two quarters, the stock price may start gaining momentum either towards to end of next week or early in the following week. Hopefully, I'll keep the other shares before the stock price gains momentum.Meanwhile $GME short put I have written on Tuesday has given me a little scare but it is nice to know the $GME stock price is way up today. I wouldn't really mind owning the stock since it is very volatile and premiums are succulent for covered calls. Humm"
For everything in life there is always a beginning and an end
THERE WE GO  
timmmmmbahahahaha
I keep buying
Mark Cuban says we shall hold! Let's go guys
wallstreet beats needs to repay all the bagholders
love the GME smackdown... lolol. you longs got pwned.
The insane difference in Put / Call premium is the same reason this stock is heavily shorted. It is on the verge of bankruptcy and going completely under. No hype or manipulated WSB trading changes that fact. It will continue to trend lower over time.
here comes $5 close
Must be more short now than ever before. Big squeeze coming at some point.
"Holy #$%$ boys, who?s still holding? Even DFV abandoned this...with millions of dollars, of course. He?s laughing with the hedgies now. Glad to see those diamond hands are worth more than your money tho."

You guys have the hedge funds right where you want them!

Here we go again. Don't do it. It's worth about $20!
loll ppl holding longs.. Rob in da Hood messed up the momentum when then stopped allowing yall to buy.
Hold or sell
"You kno what’s funny , the ppl that bought shares for 400+ of GME could just bought a ps5 form them and actually helped out the company . Such a shame"
Funny how you don't hear about SILVER only 2 days later.
hold the line? more like hold the door lol
Bull thesis:We Like The Stock.
There will be another big pump and the opportunistic hedge funds will make dollars again as longThey cannot leave the boat half fullGl
"by the way anyone here down - 100,000 or a mil lol hope no one here play margon"
The strongest brand name to own now. People LOVE Gamestop for what it did to Big Money. Think about it before being tempted to sell..
"GME guys check out $BPTH. BPTH is waiting data drug for leukemia. GLSI run from $5 to $150 and APVO from $6 to $80. BPTH is high-risk, high-reward low floater (4 mil). Do Your Own Due Diligence."
"every time you sell a share, you give a hedge fund an opportunity to cover their over extended position. You are hurting yourself, your fellow longs, and saving billion dollar hedge funds. But you do you."
75+ CLOSING WATCH !!!
"don't like 10 yr olds stop by gamestop these days--if they are open, and by figurines and used games? geez that warrants a 100 dollar share price---not"
"Hold the LINE!! Soup, unemployment, fishing....whatever, but hold the line!!"
I made 67% on my $20 puts today. How did you longs do holding this bankrupt company? 
"The media has portrayed that this whole GME run is over, why are they trying so hard to cover for the HFs? If its over they would not care so much... market manipulation at its finest and the HFs they still have to cover their shares (with interest) everyone who is holding continue to hold, these funds are going to be forced to buy back shares to cover which will drive the price up - keep holding and we the bag holders will be the last ones laughing"
160-200 tomorrow I’m calling it Shorts say bye bye to your money again lolol
"I baught at a dip of just over $90. I would gladly buy at another dip if I had the cash, because I like Gamestop. Spoiler alert: Next stimulus check is going into GME."
$GNOG is a profitable new igaming business being shorted 70% ???? Let the squeeze begin  $GME $WSB
GME will get its period tomorrow....it is starting to SPOT ............ RED!Tomorrow........ Full Aunt FLow down to near ZERO.See what I did there.
The charts for every one of these heavily shorted stocks look identical. Manipulation.
"Holding. Volatility is too high so stop looking the chart. Hold and let's see the price tomorrow, because this week it will hit 200$"
“new type of investing”. My a—s!
This much buying volume is not caused by retail. Fund war has started. Hold tight.
Chapter 11.
"shorts simple math. you have covered only 12.5% and you need 87.5% more.If the price has risen to 400 and higher at 12.5%, then how much do you come to pay with 87.5% coverage"
The fever of the sell bots makes me wanna buy more
Is the gamma squeeze still on? 
GME now
i'll see you boys at $750....
Do pumpers file a lawsuit against Mark Cuban?
"“Hold on guys, we’re going to the moon”"
Is anyone else getting their messages blocked whenever you speak facts? lol
Going to 200+
I just bought 65 shares to support
"It is over. No big players would take the risk to pump it again, because they one hundred percent believe those diamond hands are desperately preying a last chance to let them run. This is how this game played, it might be come back once, twice, then those who are so regret that not jump will be all in at third time without any hesitation. This is purely cheating game, even not a gamble."
"My Broker provider blocked $GME $EXPR and $AMC from buying, they only allow sell orders."
Big money always wins while the little fish get caught up in the net.
I hate to say this and let others see how gullible or plain stupid I was but desperate times make you do stupid things. I have incurable cancer and in desperation to leave something behind for my kids I finally jumped in today on this hoping to make a retirement acct worth leaving behind and bought 100k or 75% of my retirement just to watch it immediately tank from 155 where I hot in at to 90. Please save all the comments about how stupid I was because you never know why people do things sometimes or what it's like to know you have a set time left to take care of everyone. My question is....is this the end in the majority opinion of this stock running up over two or even four hundred? Is this the time it finally comes back to reality and goes to 10.00? I hope there is still a couple of wild rides up left and was just wondering what others think? Thank you all for your time.
slipping
All you did is make rich people richer.
"Why does a certain investor magazine say Gamestop plays plunged today? I""m being up 19.20% during the day and another 4.22% after hours. And the media wonders why we don't believe what they say. lol"
I guess the revenue numbers may go up once all these “investors” have to go sell their video games to Game Stop to cover the credit card bill and margin calls.
"Folks that were long should sell, this pop is temporary. Day traders love this action"
Going to $100000..........BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let's GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m sorry for all that are still holding. You know you knew in the back of your mind it was a bad idea. My advise. Research and invest in good companies. It works
"It all sorts itself out naturally in the end. No need to regulate moves like this. There's always going to be the winners and the bagholders, and it takes care of itself . . . like it is now."
68 floor and 73 range top. Take out 68 and we go back to the day lows.Take out 73 and we head back to the day highs.
Cathie Wood warning a GameStop and AMC crash.
THE WHOLE MARKET'S GREEN WHY ISN'T GME HAHAHA
"If GME closes below $53.33, yesterdays low, then GME will continue its decline. If GME closes above yesterdays low, we could see $110, $140 or above short term."
"I received an email from Fidelity 2 weeks ago and they were asking me if they could lend my shares that i own and they would give me 700 a month. Im new at this but I declined their offer. Now that I own KOSS, AMC, AG, GME, and I'm down 250k I can't believe that all the big brokerage are lending out our stock so shots can steal our money with borrowed stock. #$%$ So now I have to stay invested in these stocks and pray to get my money back. What a rigged market, all brokerage companies should be sued and put out of business and all crooks put in jail. I pray for all my fellow investors that you survive this slaughter that our elected officials have done to us . Bless you all."
Buying only gme and amc on the dips! Still heavy short interest and I just like the stocks too much.

"This wasn't a once and a lifetime thing. There are multiple pumps like that every week ever since covid. Problem is most people were too busy being mad at what the TV tells them to be mad about.

"Guys, please have a exit plan in place. Make sure to lock in your gains. This stock will not stay at this level forever based on current market condition and company outlook."

Excellent buy point. This price you can only lose $60.00 a share
So why didn't the NYSE halt GME when it was tanking 30 to 40%????One word C O RR UP TION!!!!
If you feel uncomfortable in your skin it’s called shell shock. You can google it and you’ll feel better about separating the loss of money and the loss of your life...
Monday will be hell time shorts. WSB is back.

"We like this at $90 we will hold. We like this at a $100 we will hold. We like this at $300 we will hold. This isn’t about money, it is about not doing what we are told. Wall street is full of sheep that flock here to do their angry 100 pound boss’s bidding. We are millions of strong individuals against an ocean of sheep, which side you on?"
Bought at 2.57 and sold at 483

TDA accepted a Limited Sell Order on AMC for $100.00/share but rejected a Limited Sell Order on GME for $300.00/share??? What's going on here??
This is an easy way to earn money. Tomorrow will open at 120
Can anyone tell me how much paper loss or real loss they have incurred in GME ?
Wall Street bets sold long ago you sheep’s
40 by tomorrow
"Seriously, how do people justify a $400/share billion dollar valuation when no GameStop stores are open??? It's a retail store, not like a technology company that produces something remotely... No store opens, no business, no money..."
notice the bots have largely disappeared... they are busy at the cash advance sore.
Think twice before selling : Sharks arrive at the GameStop party: Morning Brief
"Robinhood lifts trading restrictions on GameStop, AMC stock??? Who cares now..."
"shorties is all that you could do today, even your mathematical algorithm did not help"
$GME will spike. I see $150 on the cards again.
"We ArE AlL HoLDINg tO $1,000... NoBoDy SeLl"
This stock will jump to $150-$160 by the end of the day. Look for the roller coaster ride to continue.
"Every time you see a ""the thumb down"" on a post it is either:1- a Shorter2- an average trader with no guts.3- a disguised hedge-funder trying to insert fear.What kind of person are you?$AMC, $GME, $NOK, $NAKD, $KOS, $BB, $BBBY, $TIGR, $FUTU"

I buy all my groceries from gamestop. From milk to eggs to bread to rutabaga. Never games though because I can buy them at a much better deal online or just download.
shorts that are holding lost 40% and counting today..no way they are holding over the weekend!
“Just heard a rumor that Amazon and Telsa are considering purchasing gamestop” -some random personSource: Trust me bro
"buy, lower your average position... take this back to the moon!"
"Completly freaked out today, bought 10 shares"
GOOOOOOO
"hedge funds if you still scared, you can repeat it as a prayer, please sell sell. but that won't help you. you use fear tactics because yourself are very scared. Soon it's your time to pay 10,000%"
Glade I bought the dip on $QS after $GME lost some value today.
Is the mob still celebrating?
Mamala Yellin will bail out the trust fund hedge funders beat out by retail investors.Hahahahaha
HALTED? GOING UP? SHOCKER LMAO
Hedge funds buying $GME & $AMC to get retail to push up the price so they can short it on the top side.
It's not fair! Waaaaaaah boooo hooooo hoooo hooo!lol!
"I looked on the charts, it will reach 68 degrees in Florida"
Is this how your wife looked when you told her about your GME investment?
has it been halted again at 119.51 ? what ???
Short interest mean nothing if you don’t understand how the market works You all had an almost 100 % gain trade this morning yet did anyone take advantage of it ? My buy order at 44 did not get filled so I cancelled .Next week who knows yet this stock did what I thought it do this morning and now I don’t know so I’m leaving this stock alone
You young kids got fed a lot of non-sense on wallstreetbets.. buy quality stocks and not bubble stocks.
"I guess, game over?"
"I don't know about you, but my funds are going to make money today. broader market looks really good."
"Head fake this morning??? I can’t believe this is the slightest green... at open she dips hard and solid slope to around 20.00 by close. Manipulation at its best getting people excited to buy at open so they can get out...Wow, gme flippers getting played every day here."
"for those  I have limit sells up to 1500. qtrade limits me to that. if this pops, and we literally take money from deep in the pants of shorters, join me at goev. not now, but your gonna have a nice chunk of the moon, and would love to see another squeeze there. a good company being held back because they arent allowed to say that they are building a car with apple."
"Yup,just sold at least I sold in profit and didn’t lose"
Margin calls
"Kids, learn investing 101. Learn what earnings, pe multiple, and price target are."
Let’s get it back up
The mere volume and halts show exactly how much the shorts still need to cover. Don't fall for the manipulation. Read the WSB thread for actual numbers. Or do the math. The squeeze is still WAY on.
C'mon nobody sells!
"It’s on the way back up, green ending at close, I’ve no position on this but it will go green at close, the kids have momentum, and 200k block purchases being pushed through. Who is supporting the kids, clearly they know something perhaps we don’t"
pretty sad to see how so many people don't understand stocks... there's no reason for it to be at $400 or 100. it's going back down because the short is over. we all made money it's time to move on
"If all you kids ""HOLD THE LINE"" and rent from Game Stop 24/7 for the next bit, the stock should bottom at $5 or so. ""DIAMOND HANDS"" no downloading or playing games online!"
Why is this still 100?... Because yesterday was a short attack. Buy and Hold and this will go up.
Look at the 1-year target estimate for this stock. $13.44. And THAT's generous.... blahahahahahaha
Too bad $GME investors didn’t buy $SPCE when I told them to; they’d be in about the same place they are now without the extra losses.

 as if you thought a retail store that sells video games would sustain these prices
I think there are going rinse and repeat. Enough retail shorts are about jump on...Its same thing the longs were thinking upwards..Remember those hedge funds were are stealing millions shares.They will take it to probably 150 and make some more bank!!
Will the Stock Exchange Give Out Free Drinks to On Site Day Traders?
The best support you can do for those of buying and keeping the price moving is simply to keep holding whatever your position because it will rise above your price levels and there will be profit for longs. Diamond hands !!!!!!! $GME $AMC $KOSS $NAKD $BB $BBBY $NOK ...
glad I got out at 220 with a small loss.
What why this is drop
"As per NASDAQ official website, GME is still the most shorted stock till the moment. Just google (GME short interest percentage) and select the result from NASDAQ website."
"I suggest all the longs leave this board and check out WSB reddit thread. This one is flooded with shorts that have sided with HFs that are tryna trick you and get you to sell so they make money. The 2nd rocket is taking off next week when ppl have switched over to new brokerages and we find out about the short positions on 9/2. This is reaching its bottom tmrw , and y'all about to be big sad when it gets back up to 300+. Don't be fooled, hold long and strong "
"The conversation should be wonderful with the wife, sorry no money to buy groceries etc. was on margin and wiped out. Ouch"
"Great job, guys. You cost the hedge funds BILLIONS! And now...you've lost 80% over the past few days. Glad you held all the way down? Whoops...wait a minute...still got a ways to go down. But great job!"
"People think it is individual investors that caused all this. Nope. It are the fund managers. They weren't selling. They hold most of the shares. But I bet they sold now so that they could increase the value of their funds. This is why the stock price has been decreasing. So while they are selling, individuals investors have been holding all the way down."
"I am reading all of the same sentiment in here from years ago. The same reason this stock got shorted up to 150%. Keep living in the past. By the time everyone agrees this stock is worth buying it will be far too late to get in. NOBODY WILL ARGUE THAT THIS IS A SURE THING. But it's one hell of a speculative play and if you can't see that, then I suggest you read up a little more on Ryan Cohen and the other members joining the team, along with the directions they plan on taking. There is a LOT of untapped potential here, and they have a well established foundation to build off of. Worth 5% of anyone's portfolio (at this price range) in my opinion."

"everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.Did I say HOLD "
"For everyone bashing those buying and holding...It’s the principle not the profit. I don’t care if it goes to zero, I put money in that I won’t miss as have all people in this movement. It’s not to get rich, it’s to make a point and hopefully get some rules changes. They have not covered and they will need to at some point. I DONT CARE IF I LOSE MONEY SO STOP CARING SO MUCH ABOUT MY PORTFOLIO."

This was bound to happen
"No position in this at all, just fascinating to watch this play out, clearly there is strong resistance and the crazy kids momentum will imo lift this today again closing green. Social networks will likely explode this morning and these kids that are currently at a loss will in all likelihood pile in. When you got some older investors sitting on 15-35% losses currently on this do you feel they would sell, would you, pm data is unbelievably strong with momentum green."

To the moon!!! Please dont ever sell and you will be rewarded with exactly what you deserve. Riches upon riches!!!!
"The stock holders of GME that haven’t sold their stock are now left holding the bag for those that were smart enough to get out early. Short squeezes eventually end with serious losses for those late to the party, cuz in the very near-term, stock fundamentals will dictate stock price instead of hysteria. This will end very ugly."
How many car payments can I miss before they repossess my car?
DFV has sold .. you guys are feeding off each other like I’ve said before .
"How shocking. The stock of an underperforming company in a dying industry (retail store selling game cartridges) is declining. If only there were someway to have seen this coming, like through financial analysis or the most basic market knowledge... I'm stumped."

"Seems like:December and January: Greedy (and not as smart as one would think) hedge funds shorted too much.Jan 21-26: a crowd of young rebels plays market manipulation by swarm. Partly to stick it to the man, partly because it is fun to play together, partly because they want the money.Jan 27: It works (probably because some even greedier hedge funds took the rebels' long side), and because people believed in sketchy short data.Jan 28/29: The greedy longs get out @350 plus. A number of rebels get in. Shares change hands. Distribution occurs.Feb. 1/2: the stock price collapses (or what would you call dropping 80% from the top). What remains are the nicest people among the rebels, those to stick to a promise or who do it for the community. The cynics have probably left already. At least some longs used their ""tendies"" for something sensible or even really nice (like paying for college or someone else's medical bills)."
We all will miss AMC and GME. But it’s time to let these companies go.. 
i like the stock

8 bucks sounds absolutely fair for this stock. That’s how many times the door opened at my local GameStop this week. 7 was the pothead mgr. 1 had the wrong door.
I smell a huge lawsuit towards Wall Street since they're the ones that are halting the stock on an upward trend and did not on a downward trend. That is pure market manipulation if I've ever seen it folks. Get your lawyer's ready. Get ready for the Senate to crack down on Wall Street.
getttttt in for after hours spike. told ya

"I bet those who bought this over $300 are very angry and sad now. Thinking about all the money they lost. All the homes and cars they could have bought, the vacations they could have taken etc."
you people believe when shorts are out this will bounce back? truth be told once all short positions are covered this will be back below 8.00. careful buying this high.
Nakd about to run lets go!!! .74 yesterday hit 1.47 today. Lets all keep buying w!!

"Face it guys, this was a feel good movement that made some noise but you can only mess with Wall Street for so long (a few days at most). Eventually, the game returns to normal with Wall Street back in charge. WS owns the game and WS makes the rules. I bet a lot of these wealthy billionaires who ""joined"" the movement (Chamath, Cuban, etc) made off with a handy loot at your expense. They are BILLIONAIRES for a reason. This is reality. This is the game."

Two weeks from now no one will even be looking at this message board
$GME $AMC $KOSS Insiders selling hundreds of millions of stock. WSB selling. No bottom. 1-2 per share by Friday. SEC investigating.
Back to 400 this month.
"Management is so bad, they didn't even take advantage of this unsustainable price increase to do an offering which would have been the only sane thing to do. Sell. Sell. Sell. It is NEVER going to $400 again. You'll be lucky if it is over $10 in a year from now."
"Do you RH day traders really know what being “long” means? It’s not, hours, days, weeks or months. It’s years and years."
"RIP everyone that lost money. To all newbies out there , i hope this was a good lesson to you guys that you shouldn't listen to someone and buy what they tell you. İf you try get rich fast it will make you poorer."
HOLD n BUY we were at 70$ NOW LOOK
"It is unbelievable that GME mgmt/board did not use the run up past $300 to raise capital through an equity issue. A $3 billion raise at a price above $300 could have paid off their debt and left them with capital to continue to pursue their turnaround strategy. Complete failure of their fiduciary duties. What makes it worse is that insiders sold $1 billion worth of their own shares.While I dont blame insiders for selling their holdings. However, one has to ask, if the price was good enough for the insiders to sell personal equity, why wasnt it good enough for the company to pursue a secondary offering at $300+ to bolster its balance sheet?"
Shorts sell restrictions staring tmr
The games isn’t rigged. Just got swindled and pimped by each other. That’s all
I bought a big truck of shares yesterday below 60$ such lovely opportunity
"Looks like! Longs, be patients."
Everyone who bought puts expiring today
I'm in when it hits $2 dollars a share next week
"Don't think there are many bag holders left-very few if any, many cashed out last week, early this week, many made their money, there is nothing to see here now, no news, just watching a stock go down to it's normal value."
My adviser: You will not find any buyers when you want to sell your GME shares.
Bought at 90 how can you go wrong I can easily quadruple my money within a few days
Think it's ready for the next huge runup....Possibly $200+ tomorrow :)!
HOLD THE LINE BOYS WSB!!!
They think this slight dip can scare anyone?????!! HOLD!!!!!!!

BUY ONLY if you are able TO HOLD to make the price FLY like Peter Pan!! Otherwise this will never work and will never make the price fly!!! Please understand this logic and copy and paste.$AMC, $GME, $NOK, $NAKD, $KOS, $BB, $BBBY, $TIGR, $FUTU"
"This the time GME should announce something big. Hiring new folks is a great sign. But they need to show something stronger. Say a thank you to all the redditors, and say that they will honor them by promising to create a fabulous company. Showing gratitude is the least they can do!A strong message like that will make GME spike again!"

"while naked short selling was supposed to be elimanted by law after the 2008 financial crisis, the recent hype on GME showed that there are still loopholes to still allow naked short selling to happen. this has to be fixed to safe those hundreds how thousands of kids from learning the painful lesson of never going all in and throwing away their savings within a couple of weeks."
"Reddit followers convinced themselves that they are virtuous than other traders and forgot to factor in simple math and fundamentals. GME is a good turnaround brick and mortar going to a hybrid online company. Probably a decent entry point soon for those buy and hold folks. Good lessons for all new players...Never trade stocks hoping to punish someone else, it's like taking the poison hoping the other person dies..."
I was surprised the Game GameStop next to my barber yesterday had its sign just removed. Good Opportunity: Most shorted bio I own - LPCN.

"Guys, I was sceptical about this whole thing too. I bought AMC NOK and BB since I expected that they go sky high since it will be hyped as well. I sold all of it with loss. But today I bought GME. WHY? Because I did research and saw this is unique for sure. Since this whole thing was shorted over 100% they haven't bought back all the shares they need. They still paying millions on interest for the borrowed share. They really try to lower the price artificially. No Robin Hood isn't an evil part of the game, they just caught up by margin problems. But it helps to keep the price low. The users shifting to other platforms now to buy. In this constellation and with enough buyers (only a few knowing what they are doing) this actually really could make history as the biggest short squeeze since Volkswagen. Check it out, the path there was similar. But this could be Volkswagen on steroids. I went in with 1000 shares, knowing it can be a total loss but there is a real chance of taking part in this unique happening. It's not over. BTW I'm not angry on hedge funds I just see a unique set up which want to play ;)"
up 22% !!!. Rock and roll
"Just my 2 cents worth, having the experience of building portfolios over the past 18 years.Where are all the “diamond hands” now? Those self entitled opinions, denouncing anything and everything against their flawed narratives, denying fundamentals, rejecting facts.Early last week mockery was rampantly levied on those who cast even the slightest doubts of “going to the moon”. The only thing I see rocketing are egos and false sense of entitlement. And when things went rapidly south it was the institutions, hedge funds, platforms to blame.Absolutely no pittance given whatsoever. You deserve every single dollar lost. But then again it’s your money so do whatever you want with it.Kids, the world doesn’t owe you anything, it’s time to swallow your pride and learn some humility."

U know hedgies are scared af when they force DFV to stop posting his daily GME YOLO update. Just cuz he can’t post it doesn’t mean he’s selling. It’s cuz he has a hearing and can’t be involved at the moment.
"We all know that when you restric buying and the media is being used as a tool to spread fear, the obvious result is a stronger volume of selling. This could have been avoided if they increased margin requirement and let people buy. If brokers and market makers can manipulate the market to favor the few, this encourages uprising from the greater crowd. People are losing money because this market was manipulated to a specified direction. The banks were bailed in 2008. Who will bail the people in 2021? $$GME $AMC $IPOE $BBBY $NAKD $SNDL $BB $TSLA $NIO $PLTR"
Brokers are just supposed to be the custodians of YOUR accounts. So how does RH get a margin call because of securities in their CUSTOMERs' accounts? This smells to high heaven It suggests that what was supposed to be in their customers' accounts wasn't.
It was a good advice to sell when it was over 200...... now it's buying time....

Peoples revolt LOLhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-bet-favor-gamestop-045648246.html
"For those who are still buying GME, the pump and dump is over. There's no more sticking it to the man. It's time to look at the fundamental value of the company going forward when deciding what the stock should be priced at. If you're buying in the range of $100, you're probably paying multiple times more than the company is worth. I'm disappointed that the squeeze didn't work out better, but you all made history, anyway. Best wishes."
SHORTED AT 400 ..... can you say Bankrupt
Party is over. Will retrace back to normal levels. Who's bagholding ?
"I would short, but there is no shares to short."
Don’t cash out at a low before the rocketVW was down over 50% before it shot to 1000
They can Stop trading 30 times but it will only keep going higher if you add and hold! $600 by Friday close of option contracts
The Short Sellers options will expire worthless. Look at the Feb 5 strike 50. Top price paid. $Millions lost. We know what happens on Monday so short sellers will get clobbered again.
Is it true that $GME is included in the “No Short List” in NY effective 2/3/21? Please confirm.
About to be 1000 stores closed in the last 2 years! Such exciting news for investors!
Getting back to where it belongs in the first place!
"So many ppl with no shares or interest here going out of their way (spending all day posting) bashing this stock. It’s been days of this. If it were over, I think everyone would have moved on. Never seen anything like this with another stock and I use these boards frequently. Seems sus to me."
All for one and one for... SOLD!!!
"The only reason why this stock is up is, that the shorts took their huge profits today. Monday they come back to collect more of your money"
Short squeeze was already happened. I was warning people since $350 to sell and take profits on wsb. You can't fight hedge funds and market makers if they start to attack back. Now they start shorting from the moon back to earth. When you squeeze a hedge fund with a market maker behind him you need to get out as soon as possible. They have influence on brokers.
"The only posters left are bag holders and professional/experienced shorts. Which one are you? Tomorrow, another repeat of today."
Strong close. We all know this is blasting off next week right? $GME $AMC HOLD UNTIL ALL SHORTS ARE FORCED OUT
Wall Street want to make u believe that this company is bankrupt. If so why company didn’t have stock selll plan like AMC.I think people need to forget about short sequeeze and focus on $5b revenue including 34% eCommerce sale. Game are now mostly downloaded and so it is not reason they have $5 b sale include 34% that grows 300% during 9 holiday week.reason is gamer also getting very invested in console computer and asseosories. This is huge market and after this people will buy more from GameStop.This stock may not run like before and I think it should not. Reason wallstreet celebrating and we are not because this jump out of control is reason they able to disappoint so quickly
"IF I make money from my investments in $AMC and $GME, I can tell you right now that it will be utilized in creating jobs for people of all ages. I have run small businesses in the past, and will do it again. If you make a lot of money, I urge you to put it to work not just for you but for other people. Let's do this..."
"GME cratering because of:A) a ""short ladder attack""B) hedge fund Svengalis manipulating the markets with neodymium magnets and ESPC) Robinhood D) People stampeding for the exits because they realize that Gamestop is a money-losing business that isn't worth anything remotely close to the current stock price and the press-fueled mania has come to an abrupt end"
Pretty clear people have lost interest in this stock
ATTENTION ALL GME PEOPLES COME OVER TO AMC MAKE MONEY AGAIN REMEMBER DAVID VS GOLIATH GREAT PRPICE HERE
More blood coming - who lost there 401k I saw one guy paid $369 for an almost bankrupt company 
"Hey Siri, what’s 450 minus 98?"
"Covering hasn't started. Today was a combination of retail and fund buy. About a date to cover and interest to pay, they don't matter. Hedgefunds are scared of margin, not interest. Nobody knows the current short interest, no one, not even SEC, it would break the market if anyone knew. If shorts were live, there'd be no pint in shorting. Current short is calculated via volume/time, only a best guess and completely inaccurate in a nked short. Given current data, squeeze has not happened. Best move is to hold. Have a good weekend..."
All the great companies you can invest in and they pick this thing !!! Come on man!!!!
How will redditors make student loan payments now?
LETS GO GME!!
Unreal is it happening again?
One share ! That all you need and want to hold like your pet rick or emotion support dog!
"Lines forming to get into a GameStop store, just kidding this is for a show"
A Bagholder is born
"I think the People made a statement. That's what I care about...Power to the People. Wall Street Short Funds got crushed!!!!! Remember, you the People, You, changed Wall Street . Thank You  to All. Blessings going forward."
down 80% in 6 days and people still think this is a good investment lol
Diamond hands
better sell cause after today your going to be a bag holder for a long time
Diamond hands = Empty pockets. This stock is done!
200% short interest? count me in
I actually feel bad for all the new traders lead to slaughter by a few smart ones. Gambling has very high risk in the stock market. Pick disruptive companies with long term potential buy and hold.
Another haircut tomorrow
I bought 10 shares at the dip $64 and sold at $69 and I am happy with my $50 profits.
Yikes .. can you imagine how many people put 10k on there credit card WITHOUT even having the money ready incase.. hoping they would make money and they lost it all .. this could ruin lives...
Should we still hold. Yes HOLD.
"Don’t forget to average down , buy every dip !! Lolllll!"
second wave is the strongest!!!!
"Slowed way down. The Man halted it. Here comes ""The Big Short"" Get ready to buy!!!"
"Guys. The shorts ran it up to cover, then they have the coconuts to short it. Tons $$$$$$ made here."
"I don't understand the hate on this one. The setup for a possible squeeze is there, clearly. Now whether that takes flight can be debated depending on HF tactics to shake people off, delay etc. All potential squeezes are just that...potential. People can debate if a squeeze potential is risky or gambling, but you can't really argue that it is foolish. Bears seem to get pretty angry at the potential for fast gains, and that's the only rationale. Good luck everyone, fortune favors the bold."
Still up 30% . Shorts down 30%
"Keep buying, we can see some results already! Let's gooooooo!"
"At the end of the day, Wall Street or Joe schmoe everyone is here to make money, and the smart money sold at 400 plus"
"25 shares @ 244 HOLDING UNTIL $10,000"
Game On
I made more money selling baseball cards
is tesla next??
"Holy smokes, missed the train again"
We like the stock $GME 
"Where will this rollercoaster go next, up down up, any ideas?"
"Its holding the line, honestly I am amazed at this. Good work Stonks........."
What? You mean this wasn't really a 37 billion dollar company? OMG! Who could have known?
"Any interest in Tofutti Brands, Inc. (TOFB). Not much float, there, so a hard one for big investors to get involved, but smaller investors might be interested."
"Exit strategy?? Yes, I have mine!Die in year 2085 with my printed GME shares in my diamond hands!! #HoldingForever #YOLO"
Buy low sell high it’s pretty simple
"robinhood restrictions lifted, open season tomorrow"
"Hold with those diamond hands!!!! Robinhood account exodus continues--new accounts w etrade, etc.. will be able to buy more than 1 share"
Gotta ask. How many bag holders did this create? How much money was lost?
They’re having a quick side bar meeting to decide how they are going to handle all the buy orders
Where all the shorties at 
"Kramer doxing gamestop board members and yelling they need to issue 25 million share now. he really trying to help out his hedge fund buddies this is a corrupt marriage between politicians, media and Wallstreet vs middle and lower class"
Wall Street “Finance Wizards” be like...
A lot of small investors lost a lot of money... congratulations!
Maybe 39 for eod. Everyone should lock in any profits at this point and minimize losses. The company will return to its “fair value”
It’s unfortunate that I scratch everything I touch. Just part of having diamond hands I guess
Now I am a new bag holder 
"The falling sward is almost done. GME will start to stabilize soon. So hold on tight or start to buy again when you are comfortable. I personally just bought back in, so I am obviously long now at 97.00"
Still up 40%. Not a bad days work for the trading longs
volume is still low 10 day average is 100 million shares today is 65 million shares
how long is the halt everytime?
the moment they restricted trade buying it was GAME OVER
"The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until next Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by next Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 3-5x, because the contract need to be covered and price will rocketed"
We took a survey 10 out 10 that’s 120% their counting said . GME will be a steady $85 dollars by feb 14!
Wake up people. Management created this position and are hyping the stock to unload their insider shares. I've seen this before. Get out now while you still can in the triple digits.
"Between AMC and GME, I'm down $60k and still holding."
Just continue to hold.. It might take some time.. But good things come slower n eventually.. Now is just temporary low.
$68 tested for the 3rd time and held. Now over $70 again.If $68 breaks it will be a short at will.
2pm buyers
hold til $200! they're buying in chunks... prices from 120 to 123 etc... they are desperate for shares... do not sell!
"option expiration will be the driver tommorrow, my guess is a pin at 50, then rebound next week just a guess folks"
dont miss the train
This stock is like watching your dog eat chocolate
This is a proper manipulated stock can see big investigation coming 
I bought 100 shares at 442.00. Should I just hold?
This has dropped $400 since the high and the big rally is $3 premarket... get out its going to $5.
"Highly shorted, dont miss the squeeze"
"You reddit people were SO WRONG to abandon the battle for silver. Very, very sad.- Wall Street and big bank corruption surrounding decades long silver price manipulation is well documented and REAL. And makes the hedge funds shorting GME look like Sunday School teachers. Wall Street tricked you into thinking the Silver campaign was a trick!- The fundamental value supporting physical silver and miner stocks is real. Most miners represent a great value at current prices. Unfortunately, most of you have no idea what you are actually buying in a share of stock. Eventually all stocks revert to their underlying fundamental value, and in the case of GME that is somewhere in the $5 to $20 range."
Why are people still buying this. You think averaging down will make it better because you bought at 200 plus. You’ll just be losing more money
"I do believe any advice is given here is genuine but in this case I can only say that it’s not the same as it was back in your day or any day. This is history in the making. We are creating history’s. The major reason this went up is because buyers bought and held for over a long period and kept on accumulating. The major reason this has crashed is because of the fake news media. This all about supply and demand. Why are brokers taking hours to fill orders and why are some of them limiting shares? Do you really believe that it’s the clearing firm that holding them back or is it the billionaire shorts that are making the brokers think that this is just the mechanics of the market. OPEN YOUR EYES. We all need to fight for what is right! Shorting needs to stop. Why should people be allowed to borrow shares that you paid for and make a profit off of it? Why should your hard earned money go to some billionaire that didn’t work a day in his life? We are not gamblers.. We are not investors. We are not day traders! We are up against the 1% and we will take back what is ours! If it’s not with GME THEN IT WILL BE WITH ANOTHER STOCK. ITS NOT OVER! So ask yourself, do you want to lose all your money and be a bag holder? Or do you want to go down fighting!? Those are two different things. Only the people dictate what goes on in the market. If we don’t take a stand now then when will we? We control the market."
"You can tell on this board who is mad that they missed out, longs are still up +600% if this hits 70, some even more.Disclaimer: I cashed out higher because it got too hot"
"if this was gonna crash it would have already happened. This is a battle, has any doubter ever seen a fight before?"
Wall Street running out of gas?I thought you guys were going to manipulate the price down to zero?
l Government along with the SEC have started an official investigation here. Investors lost alot of money here with the REDDIT game. What REDDIT did to investors of GME is nothing short of criminal.
"cant believe yall sold im gonna be the only one left holding for the squeeze. in at 462 and I love this investment. New Nintendo coming out soon, malls open in no time"
Goodbye paperbacks. Time to fly.
I'm so happy I bought Puts 3 days ago! They were very expensive but the stock had dropped $200 per share since then. I still can't think of a single reason any long would ride this to zero. Make some money and move on. The short squeeze was done and over it went well and pushed a $1 stock to almost $500 but its never going back.
Jolding to 110k in losses now
"Never invested a single dime before in my life, but I signed up to a broker last month, and I am now the proud owner of 10 shares of $GMEI am holding the line from Denmark "
Where are the profits?
Why’s buying the dip so addicting?! Ppl think it dropped but for me this is a chance to get in on the action. WE KNOW ITS NOT OVER. U can’t get rid of ALLLLLLL of us.
will not be allowed to go up
"Volume is higher than yesterday. We're staying strong. Look at graphs from Volkswagon gamma squeeze. Stay strong, nothing comes easy."
Definitely hold over the weekend. Robinhood Super Bowl ad will push GME to $150.
"It's going red now lol, thanks. Ha ha"
Aim for 150...
20 next week.
IM NOT SELLING AHAHAHAH
Nice finish for the week... #stillholding
"Its not over!! Infinity squezze around the corner!!HF dont start covering, but they will"
"We got Elon Musk and Jordan Buffet on our side, hold your shares guys this is going back up real soon. people have left RH and joined other brokerages that is why there is a delay. Feel bad for the paper hands getting tricked by shorts "
Heading to $250
I believe tomorrow will be great— especially if short selling is not allowed... why in the world we ever allowed hedge funds to borrow stocks— why we ever allowed brokers to have clients investing and without their knowledge lend their stocks to bet against them...and why we ever allowed hedge funds to pick winners and losers by borrowing stocks and trying to get a company to go bankrupt in my simple mind just doesn’t seem right or ethical. When these same organizations get one upped by young folks and then we allow every organization to pile in on them to “have technical errors to not recognize trading symbols to have you call customer support with no one answering” as Charles Schwab and many others did— while this was being done and this ladder short was allowed to go on then when the stock was going up the technical issues went away and you could buy once more but don’t buy too much because trading will be halted. Isn’t it interesting it’s only halted going up but not down?? To many this is just stupid kids who don’t know what they are doing but to many such as myself it exposed just how corrupt and rigged the system is... you want to say that wallstreetbets is that blame but how in the world could you and would you short more stocks than what is available.... someone made a horrible blunder that’s where this blame needs to be placed. I hope our politicians are following this and I pray that tomorrow the market will be allowed to function fairly because the shorts as they are so afraid of will be destroyed. I’m sure this will be removed I just hope a few may see it. God Bless
Funny how we starting aggressively going up and it gets halted Fun fun fun.also NEVER SELLING
When short interest is ACTUALLY revealed Feb 9th this thing will bounce hard!!!! $300 is infantile this will blow $500+
Hows about a round of applause for the baggies. Way to become new baggies whomever bought the high today
"Logically, the hedge funds could short this to $1.Robinhood traders can only buy 1 share, hedge funds can short 10,000 shares at a time.So it would take 10,000 robinhood traders to block just 1 hedge fund trade. Until robinhood takes the block off this will trend lower."
You need to take deliveries of your shares so the shorts can not borrow it to cover it
Is there anyone knows if there is daily update on short interest ratio? Please share the link..
Kinda starting to worry a bit. I average $386. Pretty oily I know. Do you think I’m still pretty safe?
8% up
BAG HOLDERS
Valuation still at 5 billion at this share price!!! So bloated and so much more to drop! Please hold u wonderful millenial diamond hands people!!!!
"Puts at 40 expiring today , GME clear momentum, retail seems to be stronger than thought it’s amazing to watch WOW"
"We’re near a fair market value fir GME given sales and growth. However, this short squeeze isn’t over as they still have not covered."
$NAKD is going to be a winner real shortly. Short's available position has dropped from 2.8 to 2.7 million since lunch time. Check it out on iborrowdesk. More volume is needed.
Should i buy a $10 stock for $80? Is that a good deal??
Going to 50 after hours
Seriously APPL has a real future !Game Stop is going under?
"I was not interested in GME in buying before. but if they short the price so low, I'm actually going to buy more stocks. instead of owning one stock at $300, now I can own 6 or 10 times more. which means now the hedgies will have to pay at least 10 times more to get the share back from me.. easy money. "
"Short attack all day, wait for the squeeze. Short interest still high. Hold your shares"
Why everyone stressed. Cuban said hold on if you can. 50 cents kind of cheap if u ask me
is this Rollercoaster going back up?
"Bought 1 share at 85 and sold at 86, can't take it anymore, i was scare"
Here we go
"I feel horrible for the people who bought this at the peak and were basically swindled by the ones at the top of this pyramid. And then, after making a ton of money, those people jumped out since they understand this is a used video game company - sort of like a yard/garage sale company, but more specific - and left the small guys holding the bag while blaming brokerage firms for the crash of an over-hyped stock. And you can be sure that anyone who bought this at a price of above $300 is just holding on and hoping that everyone will go back to playing an XBox 360 or something. Watching this whole thing unfold makes me very sad."
Does anyone know when buying selling faucet gets turned back on?
The good news is that there is no way this drops 100 points tomorrow.
Plight of Shorties on Monday >>>>>>Shorties are travelling to the Lonesome Ville.On the way they are staying at the Heart Break Hotel.Because their travel path is flooded with their Tears
should be the squeeze of the decade
"Anybody who shorted this stock: by now either has bought it back and exited, or is holding on for the long haul if they haven't bailed by now."
well that was fun while it lasted
CNBC pumping it now!!!
"remember everyone, hold with diamond hands so I can sell at the best price"
Thanks for the discounted shares! Buy and hold! We have time on our side!
"Were does this support come from, amazing to watch this being completely neutral with no interest at all but the support resistance is really something"
"$BABA $AAPL $AMZN all going to $100,0099,9900 end of decade"
"This is crazy what the wallstreet is doing to those going LONG.First, they destroyed the company by shorting it into the deep end.Now, people are buying in to go long and they want to halt and restrict.We don't need Wallstreet Bets to tell us when to get in.It's logical to jump back in after a heavy short."
bought more McDonalds (MCD ) at this level...It head to 220 . Monday premarket SPY will pop gapup. I bought AMZN at this pulback 3400 breakout is coming today at the close.
Today is a new day...new battle. Let's win this one!
Still very heavy short https://www.benzinga.com/node/19466619
people are still buying this?
I have no stake in this but I lime the volume already higher than last few days
"Ok, The reddit crowd won by forcing some huge losses on the Hedge funds.But if YOU are still holding this stock YOU lost. There is not going to be another huge run up in this. The Hedgies already mostly covered and if they didn't, they are not going to because it is not going to go back to 300+.The fundamentals do not support where this stock is. There isn't going to be another short squeeze. It is time to let this go, recover what you can or if you are ahead preserve your gains. This has only one direction from here. Down."
"The funny thing is people think they screwed the hedge funds, when in fact there were hedge funds that made hundreds of millions trading GME. Cutting off your nose to spite your face."
"Like Mark Cuban said, ""HOLD THE BAG"""
Can’t believe people are still buying what stock you know has a value of 483 and drops 350 in several days?
"Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2020 Outlook (13 weeks ending January 30, 2021)The Company continues to focus on efforts that position it to manage through this unprecedented time, including maintaining its balance sheet strength, prioritizing the allocation of resources to areas of the business that produce strong cash flow, reducing expenses across the business, developing and expanding its digital strategy, and intensifying inventory discipline. Due to the uncertainty around the duration and evolving impact of COVID-19, the Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however, unless further unforeseen COVID-19 related impacts occur, it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter. The Company anticipates reporting fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020 results in late March."
"As a wishful long, this thing will never pop like it did because people know trading platforms would just shut it down. It’s sad really."
To those Longs How about looking up the definition of EPS. GME has an EPS of -4.22. So this makes it a Wonderful stock right ?
The waive of buyers is coming
today there will be a rebound in $64 area.
"2008: Volkswagen squeezes from $200 to $1000 in 1 day, large institutions profit2021: Gamestop squeezes - crashes and price action completely stops due to ‘not enough liquidity in the market’, retail investors can’t profitSystem is rigged"
Great time to short this stock. The irrational exuberance is over and it's going to $10 within a week or two.
"Amazing that they are still holding this, strong resistance obviously"

"WOW Shorts sellers have closed their position. Cool, but why would they bother telling us?Monkeys Strong Together Diamond hands!!!!"
I wonder why its going down with limits on buying?
Come double your money at expr soon we are gonna lift off
"2. Prohibition of share lendingOne member of the r / wallstreetbets discussion group reminded the group that while service providers (in the US) have the right to lend their clients ’securities without asking, the client can also deny this. In that case, the shares already borrowed must be returned immediately.Thus, the r / wallstreetbets group called on all GameStop shareholders to ban Stock Lending. When a significant portion of the borrowed shares were recalled, short sellers had to buy the shares they borrowed from the market at rising prices."
“”I told you guys this is going to $0””
NEED MORE BUYERS TO PUSH THIS UP
Man this is painful to watch so many people losing money here
who's laughing now?
"Smart $$ is not buying GME, they're buying PUTS and shorting if possible. To the GME pumpers - the ojective of the game is to make MONEY, not follow like blind sheep."
Hedge fund in the short position says it's a bubble. Then How do you explain that the short selling rate is over 100 percent? Pretty nasty.
"GameStop is never gon be the next netflix .. ever heard of steam, It exists already. Xbox game pass ultimate , it exist already . Stop tryna justify this"

"One important point is that even if there is a high short% on February 9 that doesn’t mean that the hedge funds didn’t already close out there positions and new shorts came in any where from 400 all the way down to 50.00 and they are in the money then and at that point it’s really hard to do a short squeeze. I have already closed out my positions and bought a put option for 80.00 dollars. I will recoup my losses and end up with a profit. I feel for you. It’s a hard lesson to learn. Most of us have lost money on a stock one time or another. Just learn from it and try not repeat the same mistakes. My brother is a financial advisor and he always tell me not to fall in love with a stock. Look at the company’s financial situation, business model and basic your decision on that. Now, there are some exceptions such as GME but the risk is much higher. You could have made money on the way up if you bought earlier enough and was smart enough to cash out so that it’s a realized gain. Also you could have made money on the way down by shorting or buying a put option. I’m not a financial advisor. I’m just telling you somethings that I learned through my investing adventures."
I'm here for the revolution. ...hello? hello?
Hope gap up tomm to $200.
GME added to NYSE Restricted Short Sale List
“Holddd the line!!” They said

One Bitcoin for the first bot to tell me who they are getting paid from !!!
Instead of buying shares just mail a check to a Wall Street banker. It will save time.
You have to pay to play. If you have a weak hand... This stock is not for you.
HALTED AAGAIN WOWOW
The same select group that created the short squeeze probably shorted at the top.
Diamond hands!!  $xpev
Whoever bought at $480 will be living in their parents basement forever...
Wow.....
"""Destroyer of shorts"" it's not me...Elon Mask today Is it going to explode???"
most of the bad comments are from short sellers or the day traders to get you out of it .. there is gain if you hold even beforethe end of the day

"GME is 401K worthy, this puppy can only go up. The stock of stocks!"
HOLD THE LINE!
"Oh boy, yall bag holders still feeling bullish on? You got warned soo many times about this but kept defending. Clearly yall aren't cut out for the stock market."
My wife’s Boyfriend likes this stock
If anyone lose money than please comment how much you lose. This will be a lesson for small players.
Fake price from ladder attacks means nothing. We retailers own all the stock. Poor shorties need to buy sooner all later. All we have to do is hold. All these bots trying to scare you only show how much desperate hedge funds are.
Im in big
could papa elon give us another gamestonks tweet lol.
This was a bubble. Its going back to 30 minimum. Maybe even 10. I can't believe I fell for this scam. Im just going to watch it drip.
"$GME, $AMC, $NAKD "
What happen to the diamond hands?
"Fact 1: Short interest reported 1/15 is 112%. There hasn't been enough volume to bring that down significantly. Fact 2: Shares float are 50.7M, 112% held by institutions.Fact 3: Days left to cover: 2Possibility: There's some evidence that they doubled down and the current short interest is over 200%. This is possible, if that is the case, it explains how the stock price ran so low. In this scheme, they would be bringing the price so low that they could cover their current short and a portion of their original short and thus reducing the magnitude of the inevitable squeeze. Disclaimer: I have no interest bashing or pumping, I just find it extremely interesting what is going on and given all the current data, there is no better bet than holding."
"The true story about the GME hype and media coverage:DFV and the WSB community is officially under investigation by the SEC for direct ties with hedge funds.There is substantial evidence that this whole clusterF was orchestrated to enroll ignorant easily influenced and gullible millennials (who are incapable of an adult conversation -especially face to face) who rely on Social Media for life advice from complete strangers Hedge Funds enrolled this “movement” to target another fund. You were all used to take out one target and set up a huge short opportunity!! You fell for it hook line and sinker!!They knew how you want so badly to be important and show how grown up you are. They know how much you’ve disappointed your parents and that you want to “be a part of something bigger” and they played on that for their own benefit! Your arrogance and need for validation and attention was perfectly manipulated! How gullible!Other generations fought wars, protested for civil rights & invented the technology you are slave to...the millennials have done absolutely nothing. Zero. Except to be formed into an “army” of pathetic internet meme junkies for the benefit of a few hedge funds! You always have “Okay Boomer” right? That’s your significant contribution to society!! Sit down. Shut up and let the adults handle it from here. Next will be $TSLA and $AMC.The only people holding now are the ones who bought at $350+. They’re hoping the Greater Fool Theory bails them out."
This can still be a five hundred dollar stock if they just do a 10 to 1 reverse split!
"Ahhh the weekend.Let's see how many people do some real research on GME over the weekend.Look at thing like:1 - Quarterly earnings - positive or negative?2 - Quarterly earnings - did they beat or miss estimates.3 - Debt, revenue, net income etc.Then think about a business model based on a product that is losing market share every day.When you look at this company's financials you realize why some many people had shorted the stock. Now the short squeeze drove the price to almost $500 - 25 times it's previous range. Once the squeeze is over (arguably now) - where is this stock headed? The company still has all the same problems and challenges."
Gamestop reminds me of BlockBuster. We all know how it ended for BlockBuster. Sorry guys
"It's always darkest before dawn, but it's too dark that i can't even see the road... :/ gonna sell soon when it opens tomorrow"

"This trading pattern yesterday and today, its the first dead cat bounce I have seen for 3 days...straight down this has gone now up 14% pm? Perfect trap for those that believe WSB saying this is going to 200 today because of options. I say #$%$ Between WSB and MMs and Hedge funds, retail do not stand a chance. They laugh at what they do to retail."

"That’s all u got to show, WSB?"
The original shorts did not cover! Now the midrange shorts jumping in ! Longs that owe nothing eating popcorn with diamond hands ! Watching the pressure packed events buying more with no cost to them!

Looking good for 100 plus rally today per WSB
If you are down 80% why sell to make the 20% back? You still lose 80% of your money. BUT IF YOU HOLD YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN 10x MORE.

"If RH didn’t set the restriction, this stock might have went up to 1000usd"
Look at the chart! Isn't it obvious the squeeze already happened ?
This stock will be the biggest collapse in history from $400+ to BK. Hasn’t made a profit in years.
Yesterday this was a $10 stock at $50 after a day of crashing. Today it is $60 for a $10 Stock. It will commence bleeding again. There is nothing but #$%$ between $60 and $10. At least the Hindenberg had hydrogen. This is full of hot air.
BUY. HOLD.
"The fair value for GameStop is around $10 per share. That would put it at roughly 0.5 x revenue. Just look at the valuation of Best Buy (0.63 x revenue), which actually is doing well. Yes, short-selling artificially depressed this stock to under $3/share. But now all you have left are the ""bag holders"". Some of them still hoping that GME will somehow bounce back up. It won#$%$ now a grind down to $10 per share. It's all over folks."
Diamond  !!! Not Selling.
80 after post market
"Very interesting volume yesterday, no longer bearish... still will monitor the movement on Monday. If it closes green again, good to pick up."
GME bag holders looking like: I’m not selling lol
"Pumping or bashing GME doesn't really matter at this point. What matters is ""What is the avg cost of the hedge funds ""Short Position""? The math never lies, people do. Based on filings/reported dates when they shorted, I get a ballpark avg of about $22-$45. This includes an avg out newer short over $250. Prior to that avg out, their cost was UNDER $10. So, with that in mind, they are still under water at $50- $100. Reddit longs still have the advantage going for them. Good luck"
Can someone please tell me how my local GameStop is going land on the moon

I've been telling you guys their will be extreme sell pressure today and you guys are still falling for it whatever you deserve your losses
bull trap
Don't you hate when people come into this wreckage and pump their own particular stock? With that said pot sector is exploding..ACB looking like a squeeze is in the process!
DIAMOND HANDS
"I honestly believe that if the hedgefunds had let this run to 500 or 1000, the longs would have cashed out, digital high-fives would have been exchanged, and it would have been a painful welt for the hedges. By forcing the price down through short ladder/manipulation, you may have cratered the kids who bought 5 shares, but you just made it more personal for the real players. The depth of the corruption that needs to be exposed goes so much deeper, the rot is so much more profound than was thought. I personally would be happy to hold past 100k if it ever got that high, because you all scare the #$%$ out of me with your unbelievable media psy-ops, fake news, and bot army. It's not about the money, but I sure do like this stock."
day traders cause little dips.. let them have their little profits... we're here for the real squeeze!

Where did the reddit dudes go
"Swing trading, investing, and day trading is not the same as it was. Times are changing. We are the age of the internet. It was a tiny subreddit that caused the global population to see what is really going on in Wall st. This is the beginning. We will see more of this. This is history in the making. We are creating history. Companies with zero fundamentals and a lot of short interest are going to be targeted. We will see more and more squeezes. This is not like the 2008 Volkswagen squeeze this is the 2021 start of a revolution squeeze. Fear and greed drive the market and both our very powerful emotions. But when you have a group of redditers with the only emotion of greed you will see a stock like GME or AMC fly up. That’s how powerful the internet is. The major reason this went up is because buyers bought and held for over a long period and kept on accumulating. The major reason this has crashed is because of the fake news media. This all about supply and demand. Why are brokers taking hours to fill orders and why are some of them limiting shares? Do you really believe that it’s the clearing firm that holding them back or is it the billionaire shorts that are making the brokers think that this is just the mechanics of the market. OPEN YOUR EYES. We all need to fight for what is right! Shorting needs to stop. Why should people be allowed to borrow shares that you paid for and make a profit off of it? Why should your hard earned money go to some billionaire that didn’t work a day in his life? We are not gamblers.. We are not investors. We are not day traders! We are up against the 1% and we will take back what is ours! If it’s not with GME THEN IT WILL BE WITH ANOTHER STOCK. ITS NOT OVER! So ask yourself, do you want to lose all your money and be a bag holder? Or do you want to go down fighting!? Those are two different things. Only the people dictate what goes on in the market. If we don’t take a stand now then when will we? We control the market. We’re in the end game now."
This is a $15 stock max.
Might be under 25 next week

"We're actually in a much better position than we were the first time this happened. A lot more people are in and holding.

Completely out for now.... bought 5 shares Yesterday at 83 Sold one of them at 125 and selling my other at 96... I'll hop back in later when it's around 75 ish I still see some potential for it to hit 140-160 In the next month or so
When all this started I suggested using trailing stops to sell.As always I got a million down thumbs. Guess what?

"I am getting upvotes. The problem is you really do need more momentum and fuel from billionaires and millionaires like Chamath, Elon, and Mark. They took clout for a movement the retail investors formed. All they did was talk. They need to place some money and refuel our will to win this. Weak hands are being shaken out and need a confirmation from whales that we can win this. Push them t o actually put skin in the game rather than just talk. Talk is cheap, actions speak louder than words. All they did was take clout and they'll move on to the next thing. Press them on this. I want to win, but I am no fool. Weak hands need confirmation from the big whales that we can win this. If you upvote me, spread the word. Because we really need their help. $GME $AMC"
"Good luck to anyone who is long and holding that bought even in the $200s, let alone at $300 or heaven forbid even $400. But a reminder from someone who has been in your shoes, simple math is not on your side. If you bought at $200 you are sitting on a 68% loss at $64. But if you're holding because you hope it will go back to $200, it would need to rise 312% just to get there from $64."
I’d anyone doesn’t feel like living please call a friend. If they invested here as well please call another friend!
"I really do hope that the only reason this is staying afloat is short covers, otherwise there will be more retail buyers that lose money."
The alogs execute their trades as the bots take to the web to scare people. Hold!
You can make up whatever reason you want on why this stock moves. That's why I love it.
"I think the organic reason for the stock to go back so lower again is simply because investors ran out of money at such a high price.. and this coupled with the new insitutional short money coming into the stock... just sorta dropped it. That does not mean that the people long sold, nor does it mean that the people short closed. This already whacked one hedge fund, who is next?"
I think the momentum is done. We were done in by robin hoods incompetence who will have an IPO and make 100 billion..........Dave the sports guy even sold and put the rest into AMC. Disgusting. They will hide behind they didn't have enough money. As mark cuban said if we would have used someone big like schwab or whoever is a titan with loads of cash this would not have happened. But robinhood didn't cut off margins or give pre announcement. F Robinhood
Awesome price action! I'd like to thank all the buyers this morning! Gave me another change to short at $80. LOOOOOL

AH GME will be at $250. Yellen is not going to risk jail to cover you shares creation crimes
Revolutionaries gonna revolution
All these bashers here are sent by the hedge funds that shorted this. They are trying to scare retail investors with their constant bashing.
Just bot GME (again). I'm back in the game! YOLO!!
This thing is like a fish you catch and is out on the ground just flopping around with no chance to get back in the water.
Seen this before up pre market ya think wait it's going to be positive today let me buy. than right after the open it plummets down because those that were waiting for that little bounce sells and you lose AGAIN.
whats the plan !!?!?!
Hold the line! Short interest has only increased
circuit breaker!

"This is not a stock, this is a revolution against hedge funds. In 2008 they screwed us, now its our turn. Whoever sells is a weakhand. If DFV hasnt sold yet we Hold! His price target: 1k"
"Today was a victory.The stock survived dropping below $5 which I speculate is around the level the HF need to get it to.Remember also there is gonna be less support for $AMC until the main body of WSB are done with $GME.Yet we are still here.I was actually expecting a day like this, and hoping it would happen on a green day. Because if you noticed the message that this sub and others have been promoting the last few days has been to participate responsibly.I would rather suffer a red day and know that my fellow AMC holders dont have their lives on the line than have anyone crash out and get burnt.So today is exactly what I would imagine it would look like if WSB AMC holders were to take the chance to make themselves safe on the spike and then come back in with what they can afford to lose in the afternoon.I was happy to see the focus turn to that, but wondered how we would know when it was happening. Well I think it would look like today..Let me tell you why this is a good thing and if we keep on doing this we wont even need the GME holders..1.) It seems like a lot of people are over exposed on AMC. This is the biggest threat to the long term survival of this group.The mods have been correctly telling people to make themselves safe and that is what we must do on every green day. Because as new AMC shareholders join this group hopefully they wont get caught in the hype and end up in the same position.. So regular warnings and guidelines will stop new members being at risk which helps us all in the long run.2.) The current shareholders who are at risk I think will be following a pattern like we saw today. They jump out on the spike then come back in the afternoon with a smaller stake..And can sleep at night.WE NEED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS PATTERNSo all of the AMC holders at risk at $6 dollars would jump off then. Then once those paper hands have gotten themselves out of trouble they then come back in for the long run on a smaller stake.We should expect these patterns on green days when we hit each share price.So I think what we saw today were the $8 paper hands leaving.. And then coming back in the afternoon.So now they are gone, and hopefully finding their way back to us, we can expect the share price to move up to $9 before we start to see paper hands again. Thats if im right.Then we will see this pattern each time we hit $10, $11 etc we should expect this especially when confidence is not so high. Until most of the AMC holders are safe.Thats when AMC holders can really activate their superpower of turning paper hands into diamond hands.The key to the WSB AMC holders sucess is not just liking the stock. But for other people to find out whats going on and decide they like it too. And if people see whats taking place with the short ladder attacks and see what it means for us all, then I think we should be able to generate enough growth to be able to recover from the members re positioning themselves financially.EDIT:This is how I think we do that;1.) Explain to them that the HF's are manipulating the markets to push prices below say $5. (We dont know what it is). And that they should get shares when they are doing that as they will be cheaper than usual.2.) When we know that the shorting restiction is in place (I guess we will know on Monday) we then tell them that because there is no HF manipulating the stocks we expect they will have a green day.. That the price will grow until they do it again and that this is the cycle that will continue until the HF's run up too much debt trying to push the price down.3.) When the HF's run out of time and pull out of the market, the price will spring back up when it squeezes. When that happens they have a chance at becoming a millionare. Explain to them that we dont care about the price. We wait for spikes and the squeeze but we are waiting out the HF's. And they cant wait forever..And we like the stock!That will be enough for most people to get whats going on.. And if they are only spending what they can afford. Then they will have fun.All the mods and us have to do is keep telling people NOT to spend more than they can afford. And as that message goes through the ranks of buyers we need to respect that is what they will do first chance if they need to.It means that every time we do this on a green day, our next green day after that will be stronger.And as long as people can spare some extra $$ and r/amcstock grows, we can expect to see less paper hands each day..But crucially.. Most members will be short ladder attack proof.After that if you can keep buying and the sub grows with new shareholders I estimate in a few weeks no one whould be phased by ladder attacks. In fact no one here will care about the price.We will only check the price to see when there is a big spike or the squeeze. Sure when confidence is high people will want to hold anyway.. But for people with bills to pay who thought this was goin"

diamond hands do you now see what everyone has been telling you?
Do you think this can hold $24 till feb 19th?
Buy now when its extremly cheap! and dont worry about the upp and downs. The inportant thing is where the price will be in the end. this is totaly unique and you cant compare this to eny other situation on the stock market. (current price is artificial and wont last forever it should be higher.)
YELLEN SAYS THE MARKETS ARE WORKING FINE - LMFAO
Hold the line 
"Here is the deal.. GME rally had a reason for it.. a massive short squeeze.. Michael Bury (Big Short guy) did not invest in this back when it was at $4 because he liked the fundamentals of the company.. He realized correctly that the stock is oversold largely due to heavy shorting & his hypothesis was that a massive short squeeze will lift the stock to a much higher number.. Which is what happened.. Now the short interest is still high but not as high it was before.. The business fundamentals may have changed a little bit due to this rally.. maybe some investors will want to buy games physically from the store rather than download it digitally just to support the business.. But I dont think enough people will do that..SO if you are sitting here today thinking this could rally more and back to $300 and somehow GME is a good stock, you will probably be proven wrong.. Lot of shorts have learnt a hard lesson & they will dare not short this again to the extent they did before.. If they do, they will probably protect themselves in a way that they dont have to cover their shorts in urgency.. which takes the risk of a short squeeze away.. Remember that in its heyday before digital downloads became common place, when the company made close to a $1b EBITDA, GME was a $50 stock..Its business environment has gotten only worse since then! So my advise is to cut your losses and save yourself some cash.. Always remember that 50-60% loss is better than 70-80% loss.. The reddit battle has been won already by the retail traders.. So there is no point left to prove.."
HOLD THE LINE!!! The Squeeze is yet to comeeee
"$AMC... Good morning from sunny Los Angeles... Volume OVER 100 MILLION in a little more than an hour the Market is open... WOW!!! I predict 600 million plus by Close today... THIS is an epic battle... The Fat Cats fighting on 2 fronts: $AMC and $GME.... They didn't see this coming and blindsided them, leaving a big hole in their battleship called a S-Q-U-E-E-Z-E..... The retail investors (whom they will look at differently after all this) verses the Fat Cats (who have gotten their way for years at the Market)... TDAY, they are throwing MEGA MONEY as a last ditch effort to discourage us into selling... HOLD HOLD HOLD... WE MUST keep the market price of ABOVE $6/share AT ALL TIMES!!!! Whatever THAT takes.... Or this war is over, and the ""squeeze"" is non-existent... OVER $7, and they will cave sooner than later... OVER $9 and some hedge funds will buckle immediately... SOME will be stubborn and pay the CRUSHING INTEREST, but can't do so for much longer. Maybe until Monday closing... Tuesday TOPS.... SO HANG TIGHT!!! HOLD brothers and sisters.... JUST HOLD!!!!! In solidarity... I, personally, cannot wait for the weekend to catch up on sleep etc.... SO, RELAX!!!! They are the ones sweating.... INSOLIDARITY to my AMC brothers & sisters. BE STRONG!!!! ;)"

"Show me the money, wsb!"
Still 95% shorted and the restrictions have been completely lifted. might see another run up?
Volume has dropped by ~150 million since a week ago. Investors are leaving this.
who thinks gme will even get back to 100?
If the market is red tomorrow. Shorts will try to use that. If this dips at open I think us longs should buy it up. Probably a dip and rip tomorrow. Some point and time these Manipulators are going to have to come up with their fake shares they've been using to ladder this down. Shorts are running out of ammo. Hold strong longs. Time is on our side longs.
"Short Seller yesterday : ""Uhhh...its going to $20, I will bet my life savings and short it to 20. """

RUETERS 11:25 am REVOLUT SAYS TRADING RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED FROM GME
Those who think it’s over. LOL
"Love this stock, I also love the fact that Wall Street is losing billions."
This has been entertaining watching from the sidelines. Shocking there are still buyers at this level when the squeeze is clearly over.
STOCK PRICES ARE NOT A GAME. THE ARE DETERMINED ON A COMPANY'S EARNINGS AND FUTURE POTENTIAL WHICH DETERMINE THE MARKET CAP. WATCHING A TICKER GO UP IS NO DOUBT EXCITED BUT THATS NOW HOW INVESTING WORKS.
Former top executive from amazon has been appointed as CTO of gamestop 
Lol robinhood all buying limits removed from GME. This thing will go parabolic all day! Here we go!
"GameStop is finally crashing down.In news that should surprise no one, the GameStop saga may finally be reaching its rocky end. Shares of GameStop fell another 60% today. The stock is trading for under $100 a share for the first time in a week as the rally runs out of steam. That's still a 450% gain on the year, by the way. But investors looking to buy now could be trying to catch a falling knife."
"Once all trading restrictions are lifted at ALL brokerage firms, the short squeeze will resume. GME would already have reached $1000+, but restrictions interrupted the process."
This is a $3.00Stock
"Mark Cuban has written a cute poem:As evening approaches, so does duskTo take your cash, ask Elon MuskTo give it back when all is doneIf that don't work, stare at the Sun"
"Got in at 363. I'm hosed, aren't I?"
"Pretty clear now that any rallies will be shorted by the big boys. There are a lot more available shares to short . That is why I got out at 90 just now. I was playing with house money and saved 1k of it. This is the ""Blockbuster video of gaming and has a dim future imo"
"This is wall street showing there hand. Basically saying for those of you who tried to take us hedge funds down this is what happens. They used illegal means to do it and will continue to manipulate the stocks until the movement is broken. Then you will have the media reporting retail investors lost big as the stocks plummeted but wont mention stock manipulation and foul play was the cause. This is being done to discredit WSB around the world to deter people from rallying together on stocks. $GME, $AMC, $NAKD, $BB, $NOK"
"FEBRUARY 04, 2021 / 10:34 PMRobinhood lifts trading restrictions on all stocks, including GameStop WOW, WHAT A DAY"
Ha. Massive sell off will happen first thing tomorrow. I can't even fathom the pain this inflicted on hype buys
"Added another 1300 shares, let’s make some money "
I said it once and i'll say it again.... Get out while you can... price is only supported by volume which is dropping day by day as people are losing interest... Over the long term price is supported by the fundamentals of the company which again does not support this price level. Volume is the only thing holding the price at this level which is again dropping day by day as people lose interest.
This spectacular collapse reminds me a little of Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns back in 2008. Thank goodness millions of people's mortgages aren't involved with GME.
Gamestop that's where the wall street Games Stop. Like this if you have  like me.
That last candle was green

Prediction for tomorrow?
"I use my partial stimulus check $4,200 buying 100 shares at the price $42, it rose to $500 and I gained $45,000 profit at the peak, but I didn't sell, I need to support WSB, it is my honor that I am still with the WSB Front Fighter."
"850k daily costs , how long will this be in play? Thoughts ?No position at all but the resistance and capital support knows no end. They have nothing to loose really, the 850k daily costs on hedges is a different matter all together. How come s3 changed reporting synthetic shorts, can you explain as I don’t quite understand this part cheers good evening"
So many of us tried to warn you all but you just attack instead of taking advice from actual traders....
1000% of the float should be shorted at these prices.The slow PS5 availability is the nail in GameStop's coffin.
Pre-market illusion of gains today?
Pre-market going to take us out of the atmosphere. By the end of the day we'll be at the moon. (Moon = $150-200)
Closing today
This is the 4th halt and the market has only been open about 1 1/2 hours.
"Are we still holding, sir? Aye, aye cappin!"
This not the way to the Moon.

"Attention Wallstreetbets /Reddits. $Finv needs your support. $100 lift will be awesome. If more, we will not complain. Lol You did it with $AMC and $GME.Now time for Finvolution.)))"
"will likely go down to where it was before this rally started, at about $4. Why wouldn't it? only one thing has changed and that is i believe the company sold shares into the rally and it may reduce some dept."
shorts be like
If prices keep dropping I will buy in with mortgage money
"Yesterday I though this board is run by the paid shorties, today it looks like there are some general people here!"
This is not gonna magically pop to 1000$ .. this stock has a higher chance of going bankrupt before a squeeze happens again
This is why I’ve been saying next week TENDIES
"So, after all that commotion is GME a buy or not and tell me why?"
Look at the bright side. If it closes below $100 it can't lose over $100 tomorrow! :)

Oh boy!!!
who dares to buy now?
"Anyone who is long this stock will be further decimated. It's simply laws of physics. You can talk all day long about how the shorts need to cover. I've been saying for days that the shorts are gone. They took their losses and are out. You are trading among yourselves. I admit, however, I do have puts that are struck far OTM for March. So hey, why not help me out? But seriously, I just want everyone to understand that the physical laws of the universe can't be altered. Think about it another way, there are people who literally bought the stock at $500 who have lost 80% of the value of their investment, so far."
I don’t think GME will go to the 52 week low. But I’ll be a buyer of GME around $20 to this is a safe investment.
Time for it to run up to $150Let’s Go Team WorkHOLD HOLD HOLD
"Warns Chukumba, “Here’s the scary thing. GameStop hit a high of over $480. Now it’s down to less than $100. Last we checked that stock is worth $10 a share."
Hey wanna buy a $10 stock for $60?
"GME guys check out OPHC. Low float just 1,7 mio float. OPHC is fast growing company https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18127806-optimumbank-holdings-inc-ophc-nasdaq-announces.Do your own due diligence!"
The crash happened literally as soon as RH banned buying on these stocks. I was eagerly watching BB in the pre-market and saw it go from +5% to below -20% in a matter of minutes. The worst part was that they gave absolutely no warning and they did it in pre-market so all I could do was watch my gains disappear.
Educational note:Two types of shorts are NOT RECORDING in the volume tab.1. Disclosed Shorts2. Naked Shorts.
RH lifted the ban so this should skyrocket?? hahahah
$GEL - get your cash out of GME. Buy $GEL. Already up 5% today. Get 10% dividends and shares are only $6.60...huge opportunity high quality company. Low float low volume

All these millennial investors learning a tough lesson on investing these past couple days!
When is the FBI going to show up? There is plenty of financial fraud going on at these Hedge Funds. They are manipulating the price using illegal tactics!
"Call me a conspiracy theories if you want but the fact they’re doing too much to scare gme holders makes me so bullish. They try to attack the share price, making it go down so much, they try to divert our attentions to other stocks (silver, bb, amc), they try to get mainstream articles to say shorts have covered, the squeeze is over (they’ve been saying the squeeze was over since $80-$100) this is why I’m so bullish"
Is it too late to buy?

It would have less expensive and no advertisements to have covered at $200 a share not the fun starts!
"The problem of all shorts is they lack flexible thinking. They make short decision based on some formula they learned from either some school or some book. When stocks do not fit their formula they go short. The problems is the human society is a dynamic one. When innovation creates the next thing, it is based on all the knowledge accumulated so far, and therefore the speed of change is accelerated. If you recall Netflix from shipping movie DVDs to customers homes to online streaming, it is almost instant.So rather than reddit users ganged against hedge funds shorting, I see this is a market sensitivity to rapid change in GME's business to the upside. Stay tuned. If you owns some shares , whether it is at $200 or $400. In two years you will all make money, maybe very good money. Trust the human ingenuity."
"Something positive on a down day, today is Ground hog day"
GME going up is very good thing for GME company. Also it is good for people who bought a month ago. Please help them so they can sell at profit by buying today!

"Have the brokers begun to allow normal trading on all stocks? Or, are some still restricting the trading on certain tickers?"
"Nobody held a gun to your head. There is no one to blame but yourselves. Own it and move on. It’s a valuable lesson kiddos and this to shall pass. You have all the time in the world to make this up. There is no get rich quick scheme out there and if sounds to good to be true, it is. Do your research, invest in good quality companies. Spread it out. Buy some well managed mutual funds. Take what analysts say with a grain of salt because they all have agendas. All kidding aside, good luck to you."
This stock should fall below 20$ by next week.It will close tomorrow at 30$. If you have lost a lot of money go and buy puts. This stock will go down.

"I know a lot of people have lost a lot of their hard earned money on this stock, and I do feel bad for them, but let’s face it, this stock is fundamentally worth not much. By not much, I mean under $5 per share. This company reminds me of Blockbuster. It worked well in the past, but they have no future. We all know what happened with BlockBuster...sorry guys"
"Congratulations to those who held and forced a squeeze. Excellent job. I have been trading since the 90’s and nearly every message board for various stocks, through the years has been filled with traders urging others to hold and buy more to force a squeeze, but they never succeeded. You are the first. It’s funny that some are big Wall Street players are now talking of investigating this yet they have ignored, and are likely responsible, for all the naked shorts over the years in numerous stocks, not to mention the massive manipulation that has been occurring in the silver market. If a squeeze can be started in silver, as I read is being attempted, it would make a game stop run look tiny, just because how much silver is manipulated. It of course will be much harder to squeeze silver, you just can’t buy up the miners or the etfs, given the manipulation is done through the false paper contracts, so the only way to squeeze is to buy up silver itself and take delivery. It would be a huge undertaking. Although the GME squeeze was excellent, the alleged sequel of AMC was not a good choice. The newly entered convertible debenture trumped any squeeze, as while you were buying up shares the lender was dumping new shares into the market. I wouldn’t be surprised if the AMC sequel wasn’t planned by the lenders to assist them in making a profit on their loan by an increased share price; as opposed to the GME crowd. After all the GME squeeze hadn’t finished yet, so why start a sequel. Then it appeared various sub groups tried to squeeze the other top 10 heavily shorted stocks but too many stocks were trying to be squeezed at the same time, compounded by the failure of the AMC squeeze because of the convertible debenture and as GME hadn’t finished yet, doomed these attempts as there wasn’t one stock to focus on like GME.I’m curious to see what will be the next short squeeze candidate. My thoughts is BGS would be a great candidate as it’s a profitable food company (they make such brands as Green Giant, Crisco, Skinny Girl, Ortega, etc),with a 5% dividend and 37% short. It’s being shorted heavily as the big boys claim they are over leveraged as they borrowed to buy additional establish food brands to add to their portfolio. This over leverage argument has been made for years and is weak. These shorts have been making his argument of over leverage for years while suppressing the share price; meanwhile the longs, whose shares were artificially kept low by these shorts, would continue to get their hefty dividend; the company’s sales increased, especially since the pandemic as people are cooking more at home; and borrowing costs for the company have been and will remain cheap and thus the argument made by shorts aren’t supported by the facts yet they continue to manipulate the stock price by their shorts. The float is smaller than GME (although not as low as a covid vaccine stock that I like, CAPR, whose share price is under 7 and it has only 20 million shares, which is 1/3 the amount of a GME and BGS, but I digress). BGS looks like a great candidate for a short squeeze as it’s a solid business, with a great dividend, low float, and a high short position."
"The volume says it all. The past two lower trading session volume is tiny compared to the prior five gaining days. SEC and Robinhood's halts manipulated GME down, and keeping it down for now. Buyers are holding, GME should test $300s."
HOLD THE LINE
this will go up look ad volks hold your share
This is why you don't get into a $15 stock at $400. It's $15 for a reason. And the law of gravity always wins.
lol I posted on here when this was at 400 that within days everyone on here would be threatening to sue everyone. happens every time
"It's impossible for $AMC and $GME to have the very same chart, and yet they are. Nothing we see is real anymore."

"The best $1,500 I have ever invested. I'm definitely keeping a few shares just as a reminder that one should always trade with a well capitalized broker and that buying assets at a discount can be amazingly profitable, but options is where the money is made. As far as GME specifically, let's see."
Don't get too excited! This is the dead cat bounce!
"Fl...you may not be, but most of them are.I think there are 2 kinds of shorts. I sometimes go short as well but usually either when I think is way overvalued or just pure momentum using the pullback. But there is this professional big money hedge fund managers who are manipulating the stock price. You know what I'm talking about. Keep shorting it at the bottom regardless of the valuation or the fundamental to drag the price down lower and lower to the ground and in the meantime individual investors are losing lots of money. It's quite different from when you short it at the top and wait for it to go down. And for that reason It was refreshing to see this phenom and I hope this will make them stop playing game. But I'm sure they won't."
Gamestop should by Valve the company behind Steam. The stock would immediately double.
"Hold to your shares, this will sky rocket before day end"
"The only GME reality is that hedge funds and brokers colluded to bring the price down when things weren't going their way. Meanwhile the GME business model is pivoting to a Netflix like account system so gamers can subscribe to online offerings. They recently created a new Head of Technology position (starting Feb 15, 2021) to facilitate the transition. But are you going to report on any of those promising business moves? Of course not, because you are too busy regurgitating whatever message hedge funds and brokers want reported rather than looking at primary sources for your ""facts""."

"Was hoping for a big pre-market advance in the pps. Was up $15+ earlier this morning, but now GME is struggling just to remain green. Who knows what the rest of the day will bring? If the pps stays in the red today, no doubt more weak hands will fold their tents and move onward."

One share hold it!
I really don't understand why I still see so many people without a single share of GME are hovering around and leaving negative comments here. Doesn't sound like these people are trying to save innocents victims but to make sure their decision of early sell or never bought wasn't wrong. I really hope that they can find something more useful one day...

Redditors were never your friends. The pied pipers of WallStreetBets led you to your demise and you have no one to blame but yourselves. Rather than focusing on fundamentals you bought a stock to hOlD with no understanding as to why or it's actual value. I get wear the anger comes from against the institutions but this wasn't the way.

"Senvest Management's fund surged $700 million, while Morgan Stanley's GME shares rose more than $100 million. Industry evaluation said that the forced air battle is not only the carnival of the little people, both sides have big players. Muddy Waters founder Carson Block has said it does not look like the WSB's retail investors, but rather more like a short squeeze by some hedge funds against other hedge funds. According to the Wall Street Journal, Senvest Management's flagship equity fund, which began buying GameStop shares in September, has seen its assets under Management soar by $700 million to $2.4 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 as the stock price soared from less than $10 to more than $400. In January, the fund returned 38.4% after fees. Even in January's frenzied U.S. market, Senvest Management was one of the biggest winners."

"$TSLA Tesla Forced for touch screen recallTesla resist saying it's not premature failure , Their life expected 5-6 yearOther hand Tesla selling $10K upgrade that promised soon and after 4 year yet to deliver.Tesla buyer see look their touch screen going to last full 5-6 year, No one hold car that long, no big dealTesla buyer on FSD , look they delay but it is coming may be next year, may be 2 year may be 10 year but Tesla car will last longer than that."
GME investors should use some of their money and buy IPOE as it is taking SOFI public. They should also buy BFT as they're taking PaySafe public. Both of those new stocks SOFI & PaySafe are the new crypto currency future & banking future. They can both go #100 a shares or more quickly.
"Look at all the shootings today, I’m calling it now, many of these people fell prey to WSB pumping diamond hands and lost everything because they believed the lie. Please leave the stock now before you lose it all and work to repair your trust in the market."
Corruption and manipulation in a staggering way. Only halting it on the way up. Now that is collusion
$150 closing.
When the shares go from $90 to $5 people will still cry short ladder attacks. Still drinking the kool-aid?
Nice. Up 20%
get out and buy PUTS to recoup you lossesthis is going to $5 TODAY
"I hope I can help those right now who are feeling down if they have a lose currently with their AMC trade. First, THINK POSITIVE. Fight those negative thoughts running in your brain because they are CANCEROUS. If this trade turns out to be a losing gambit then show no emotion about it. Learn from it and move to the next. The problem is when you let your emotions guide your decision making. That is a recipe for disaster. Remember, whatever lose you have on this trade can be used to deduct from your winners on your capital gains tax. So it is not a total lose. With that said, this trade isn’t over. It can still bounce back. Personally, I’m LETTING IT RIDE  $GME"
I'm taking a nap and not looking at this anymore I have all my money in it and I know my price of $1000 will eventually sell when the squeeze happens this week or next week
This thing was in the middle of a huge huge squeeze at 300 but people started to sell out of course. No stock had the potential of this one
I’ll yolo 10 shares at 1pm $nok $amc $gme $bb
"People wake up. There is no way in the world that a stock at $36.00 is going to shoot up to $483.00 and hold it. Be VERY lucky to hold the $90.00 that it is at!! I am happy as a pig in xoxo that the shorts got wiped out in the beginning of this but dont be mistaken. They have been re-shorting this at $400.00, $300.00, $200.00 AND they are making a fortune!!!"
"By nature I'm a long. Going against, shorting, the natural order of growth is tricky. However, in this case, don't let delusions cost you money. The pump was amazing and every retail investor was cheering you on. Now, take profits if you haven't and get back to disciplined investing. I'm glad you had fun and I hope you made some money."
will this go up tomorrow
Back to 17 Robinhooders
Thanks god I shorted this stock hahah. 40 k gain

I've been a bad boy. Let me get back out at $85 and I promise to never touch GME again ;(
"what happened shorts, it's not 50 yet"
Just look at all the weekly put trades that went through at the open.. Massive losses.
Look what’s going up
"As this dips more and more, I’m curious as to where the price is going to settle. Anyone know or have estimates for what GME is actually worth at this point? Is it likely that this downward momentum pushes SP below that number and then it bounces back up to a fair price? Watching from the sidelines but curious about what people think will happen."
"If they’ve been able to pump the TSLA Ponzi scheme to an insane valuation with the help of WS analysts, why should this be any different?"

To any little guy reading this. Sell now. The market is rigged and this was proof. Sell before it goes to $5 tomorrow at open. You have till 8 PM.
Max gain for the hedge fund option players must 70 to 75.

Mark Cuban and Elon Musk are probably shorting this stock.. don't think they are your friends.
Under $40 today
NYSE put this on the restricted short list for tomorrow so no one is allowed to short it anymore..
"Current average target price for GME is $11. Short term fluctuations aside, this is where the price will eventual head."
"media like CNBC wants you all to think ""duh of course this will drop"" but the reality is this stock is still HEAVILY SHORTED, let me repeat HEAVILY SHORTED, don't let anyone ""including me"" influence your thinking you know what the deal is here. For me, the stock is lower b/c hedge funds and external players are trying to manipulate it. Companies like CNBC have ""friends"" and conflicts of interest just like Robinhood does with citadel, I'm not giving up, I have diamond hands, I still believe despite being down here at $95 that the $1000 thesis is still very very much alive. Shorts just raised their launch point, it means when this pushes higher on reveral it will go much much higher."
Just call it halting now lol
What do you guys think of our new secretary of health?
"DO NOT SELL, THIS WILL POP AGAIN ONCE RETAIL INVESTORS GET THEIR FUNDS OUT OF ROBIN HOOD AND INTO REAL TRADING ACCOUNTS. SHORTS CAN'T AFFORD TO COVER LONG TERM"
"if you want to hurt Shorts, which you should, hold tight reduce portion of the float available to trade, there has been too many shorts who recently sold to open short positions between 90-49, take them out first and then bigger guys who have been holding longer"
"60% drop yesterday and can't even hold any gains premarket. Oh man, this is hopeless!"
U all r getting played if u r still here - move over to $evok - make it back when that one triples. Small cap low float with 1 million short. About to explode higher as they have a product just on the market with FDA approval last year. Sales ramping up! Buyout target.
more fun than in Vegas lol
Robinhood lifted all trading restrictions
"Hedgies know they can’t push it down further or else people will start buying it up again, they will cover next week or tomorrow, good game"
"Crazy how neutral i am on this now. I got in @77 on 1/25. Right before mainstream. Followed the hype, was stressing, got out @360 on 1/29 DESPITE all the emoji’s and “diamond hands”.

Some of the others too maybe $NOK $BB $XPR $SNDL $NAKD A lot of thr trading charts are incredibly similar, I don't think they are a coincidence!Looks like someone may have figured out how the manipulation is being done with the 'meme stock's.

Contact investor relations with your company. Contact the SEC.

Buddy who thinks Rey Mysterio actually beat up The Big Show says hold
I smell fear anyone remember last time Elon tweeted
"What's really could be happening if there is no easy way out for Hedge Fund Manipulators to cover their short position? Distribute the debt to others. They can't just wipe out their short volume without buying back shares. There is a big problem. If retail investors aren't selling and keep buying they need to pay the price that we ask for. Data shows there should be a huge amount shares to be covered. So what's their plan?Distribute Hedge Funds debts to other investment firms and retail shorts. How?1.Create a downwards trend by manipulating the market. Get retail investors to think its going down to $50 and let them short. Buy all shares from retail shorts.2. There will be panic sellers / Early profit takers etc. When they all sell Buy using market orders to cover short minimise the short position.2. Now the price is at the bottom, So what will happen to $500-$800 Call options? They will go down. So loaded up more call options to cover your short position losses because you know when you cover your short position share price will go up.4. Start covering short position in premarket when the volumes is low so the price will go up. Yes Hedge funds will be paying big money for the share at loss but they will be making more money on upward trend using call options anyway. 5. Remove restrictions on Robinhood and in other platforms so buyers and buy the stock and pump this up while covering there short position. Again this is my opinion on how they could do this if everyone keeps buying GME."
$AMC $GME Stocks going down. Shorting prohibited. Short squeeze happened last week... means everyones selling.
Condolences to bagholders. Congrats to smarter profit takers who reaped the reward
Get out now! Don't lose it all!
How come nobody is making noise about them halting it when the stock is recovering? I don't see CNBC / politicians or anyone speaking about this manipulation?
Well at least you’ll have a tax write off on your loses
"Anyone buying now is getting a deal ... be grateful you got here at this moment ... bagholders are not born on huge pullbacks ... profit takers are.

Everybody's arguing on these chat boards and the funny thing is the people that buy massive amounts of shares do not spend their time arguing on these things they do it there gonna do regardless So if you want to buy it buy it
we tried to warn you..you cant beat wall street--you just cant-especially with one share of stock and a trading platform like robinhood.
All those who paid $200 - $400 for this #$%$ are now declaring victory because of a $10 bounce.

"Let's face it, $GME investors were winning BIGLY, until they (Citadel & Vlad Tenev) changed the rules. Even this recent capital raise by Robinhood might be just false flag, to cover their crime (tries to justify it).Good luck my fellow diamondhanded #$%$ We bought MOAR and holding strong!"

"The manipulation going on in the market is getting out of hand. Based on earnings, NOK’s free cash flow should put share price anywhere from $6.08-$7.36 but what happened, it went down for 2 straight days. My theory is that with hundreds of thousands of calls set to expire today, the MM’s held it down to keep all of that money from the now worthless contracts on top of tricking people to sell at a loss. Now let’s see what happens next week. Anyone care to argue this won’t end somewhere in the $6 range next week?

"WSB : More Investors who moved from Robinhood to other trading platforms will have money to put into GME beginning tomorrow and Friday. They will help keep this going. This is getting done at 100 shares a pop. Robinhood squashed this effort good, but it is no over by any means."
Calm down CNBC. It's SHORT COVERING Friday.
"Get Your Tickets! .. ""GameStoppers At The Gate"" All World Movie Award Winner.... now showing in all theaters, discount available at you know where."
It's going back up when they want to take it up. What you saw happen was hedge funds ganging up and buying and selling to each other while retail were only restricted to sell.So you some hedge funds holding millions of shares still. When they want to get out. They are get retail shorts to buy in in the millions and then they will run the same game only on the up side this time... its rigged on both side for the hedge funds...
Hey shorts get ready to pay margins!
It's Wall Streets Bets for a reason. It's gambling. And you don't even get free drinks. You lost.

"Do not put any more money into this. The danger isn’t that it opens at $50 after pre-market, the danger is that it starts going up and people buy more. It will hit like $125 to $150 and then collapse and people will double their losses. I don’t own it and never have. I feel bad for people who lost money but at the same time people have to learn. I know from experience. I encourage you get out. At least sell half."

"The impatient sold for a loss, smart people didn’t sell & held their positions because they knew there were enough people invested into GME for it to stay above $50. Now the impatient are buying back into the stock as brokerages have to allow unlimited buy orders & the SSR rule is in place today. Once the true short float information is released next week, you will understand why the stock is being heavily manipulated & realise how much of a monster we are dealing with"
"yaaaawn is that all shorts?! they are bearing down hard today. Still not letting go of a single share, in fact I am going to buy."
Ya these guys were led to this stock by a couple of smart investors. This build a cause around what they were doing and got the retail investor in with a story of good and evil everyone can relate to. Once the price shot they exited there strategy leaving the new investor with the bag. Go look at chats on how much money retail investors lost on this trade. Soon more will once there options expire out of the money. You guys need to understand these guys played you its obvious in the price.
Next stop 5th floor.....

All stocks at some point should be sold to some degree as a matter of money management ."
"face it....majority of the real time traffic on these stocks are people making sure NOBODY IS SELLING! do you see the pattern here? someone sees a bot shilling sales of the stock and people follow driving the price CLOSER TO THE HEDGE FUND PRICE TARGETS. Don't be fooled. the price will not be $100 if they can't all their positions back for that price, WHICH THEY CANNOT RIGHT NOT.Hold The Line and buy this dip!"

Bears seeing their puts on monday
GameStop is a washed up business that investors should have known better than to invest into. The irony is that most of the bagholders are the younger investors who are the people who killed video stores by using online apps instead.
And here comes $60's
"My current long investment thesis: Will the current long investors allow the shorts to destroy the current share price? NO, They will now protect the value of their investment in $GME."
Huge DUMP incoming..... Robinhood might put restrictions back on!!!!!!!!!
Short % of float on 14th Jan was 226% at $40. Did all the shorts get out and swallow the loss?
This market is backwards. GME is tanking but nikola is raising and they only have a business plan. You can’t make this up lol
Raised to 500 shares ROBINHOOD. GME...no.comment they are holding their cards tight beware ; PROGAGNDA MINSTER out tonight
LETS SINK THE SHORTS SHIP AND REACH THE MOON!!!!!
"Every person who was part of the Reddit-GME scandal should be crushed. This was outright fraud. Stock manipulation. Conspiracy. Front running. Far worse than a hedge fund shorting a stock. If the Reddit ""investors"" were in the business, they would have quickly lost their licenses to do business."
Options expire on Friday. The short squeeze could happen in the afternoon. Interesting day to watch.
Sounds like the GME board listening to retail investors Mark Cuban even says HOLD & thanked the Robin Hood investors for getting His kids interested in the market!!!
look at the shorts showing off and giving sage advice. lol
"I BOUGHT 1,000 SHARES AT $400 WHAT SHOULD I DO???!!! I REFINANCED MY HOUSE TO DO THIS NOW I HAVE NOTHING"
It’s OVER take your $GME $AMC & $TSLA profits and invest in $XLE $OXY $ET & $GEL. US crude stockpiles fell substantially for the 3rd straight week. Oil & Gas is back. The green bubble is popping right along with GameStock.
Shorts must be in an even bigger mess now. They 'knew' Gamestop wasn't worth what the stock market said so the only logical thing to do was short it. I'm not sure they have allowed for Hedgefunds with no exposure backed by an army of R#$%$74r@ retail investors?
DON'T SELLL HOLD HOLD HOLD!!!!
"Are we are TEAM or not??AMC folks: if at 1:05PM people would have HOLD the LINE and not sale for small profit - the stock would have been now at 12$, at the minimum.If you dont have balls to hold, dont buy.2PM EST today, we are buying and holding again. I will buy 5k more shares!! Buy and Hold (at least till friday)LA REVOLUTION $AMC $GME $NOK"
congrats to the shorts who survived the way up and down. just sold my puts for 24k profit. alittle early but was sweating bullets when this was 350.
Should I buy GME now or wait for another dip today?
Back to 40$  my puts will be printing soon

If I had a short position and this stock started going up again I'd run for door quicker than I could write a disparaging comment.
short interest is still 100%. If you buy and hold they will will have to cover and buy position to pump up the stock even more. Please be patient.
This is the next $GME. Will pop to $30.
"Hedge funds will have to buy, and they ll do it coordinated so the stock soars and take profits. Maybe it s tomorrow"
Can't wait to watch GME reach new lows today
"I shop at GameStop all the time. I get my milk, bread, chicken and bananas from there. But not games because I can find much better deals online plus I just download."
"Meanwhile, this stock is still heavily overvalued. For anyone thinking there’s a long strategy here, think again."
Very nice climb
to the moon  and back to 
Not feeling sad for those who did not sell I told you that this is going to close $20 today ￼
"For those of you who are confused about what is happening. The entire stock market is getting ready to implode. GME is on the brink of a major gamma squeeze to +$1,000 as competing hedge funds will be going long. In order to cover losses, the hedge funds who went short on GME will be selling off their long positions in blue chip stocks. Smart money is moving into crypto, blockchain, and volatility indexes. This is not investment advice. I am mostly a crayon eating amateur."
I have e-trade account. They blocked today. I am not available to sell at all.
It will close red today
Next Tuesday will really show which way we will be going. Respects to those who are still holding.$EXPR $AMC $GME $KOSShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZcwbfNur9o&ab_channel=JeffreyForbes
I want to buy around 2000 shares at the open tomorrow. Is this a safe investment? It seems like a lot of people are buying it.
This play is over.....The Hedge funds who shorted have already covered and made millions above their breakeven point. Get out while you can as this going back to $10........
Is it going to 1000 tomorrow??? Anyone? Hold the Fort... but do we still have to buy to raise SP?
"This is the rest of the short covering. If you go in now, you're setting yourself up for a total loss."
I know it is hard...sell everything and move to $BFT You can recover in few months easily.
I'm thinking 40s by close. What a disaster for people who actually think this is INVESTING when it's really GAMBLING.
"In a month or two when GME is back down to $10 to $20 and you lost a lot of money, print out the GME chart so next time you don’t forget that stocks that go straight UP, always come DOWN!!!"
"i went to the bank for a loan. i had a business case laid out for a guaranteed return on investment: i showed them the wsb subreddit explaining the short squeeze. however, they still denied me...yet another case of the system being rigged against small guy."
"For me, the clearest indication of manipulation is that GME and AMC have paralleled eachother so perfectly over the last week"
Omg wow.
"I want to personally thank all of you for your Investments, personal donations and absolute determination not to sell!"
Buy and hold the line !

"Folks look at the after-hour volume. People are buying are 500 stocks in bulk, just image more than 1.3 million stock being bought."
Do most GME holders also have AMC? I would say 85% right?
"My nephew decided finally to sell. He lost 8500 $ of his savings, but still have 4000 $ to fund his studies. Anyone who took the loss or profit?"
When is GME going to merge withDAVE + BUSTERS
BUY THE DIP WHILE YOU CAN
The positive you all if this closes under $100 you can’t drop a hundred again tomorrow... bright side..
is anyone still trying to buy this?
At least Robinhood is offering purchase up to 100 for the people still with them. Not that they will stay for long.
Paper hands all over this place !!! lol. You lost !
this one is dying just like PTON and TSLA
selling msft and buying this here
This will go back down to $7.
There are going to be tons of media campaigns by hedgies now to take retail investors money... sad.
No Matter what...sooner or later you'll see $150...so you're in a good spot
$AMC AND $GME HAVEN'T 100% SQUEEZED !@#! LIKE THIS AND LET PPL KNOW WE DONT STOP!!!
Serious only... So a couple of my friends talked me into borrowing some funds on my equity line. I bought 178 shares at 369. I was assured it was going over a thousand. I know not smart. Whats the chance of seeing 369 again in the next week? My friends stopped taking my calls. And my wife dosent know either. Paying off the mortgage was going to be the big surprise for her birthday.
I am sure that trading was halted to protect retail investors and this isn't being manipulated at all.
Wow everyone was given a soft landing yet there are still those that are investing a short term anomaly which will completely disintegrate in a matter of days. Had your chance to get out
short dip.. don't fall for it... hold!!!!
"There is not a thing shorts can do, but BUY. For every hedge fund restricting to 1-2 shares, others are buying 100 on dips. Simple economics, but a very unique situation. All that can happen now is circuit breaker and hope for the best. Won't happen though, because Senate and house members are watching now. "
Smart money moving in lol
I bought at $483... should I buy more to average down?
This could imo hit $ 150 today unbelievable WOW
"Fake price. Market manipulation but the shorts still need to cover, that means another short squeeze is coming then u will see the real price is higher than this."
"Hey Wall Street, can you manipulate the price down just a little more? Looking to get a few orders in before end of dayThanks!"
"Don’t let wall street win, change up the play and regain the losses. $nakd"
Money isn't toy short-Hedge funds. It will be different this time!
