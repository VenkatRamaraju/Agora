I guess that Kerpapernick thing isn't doing what it was hoped to do.
"Since he is a billionaire, Trump committed to giving the salary that he earns as president to different causes.Trump donated the salary that he made in the first quarter of this year “to the Department of Veterans Affairs, a gesture the White House said underscores his commitment to recognizing the sacrifices to military and their families,” the Military Times reported.Since taking over as President, Trump has lost approximately $400 million in personal wealth — which is most likely the greatest decline in personal wealth any U.S. President has ever endured."

It comical to see the fake news articles written about the success of Kaperdiks ads.. This is not a 40 yard dash.. The stench NKE left will linger for years in the minds of those making purchasing decisions.. The pain of sacrifice of real Americans will be taken out on NKE at the register..

Nike will make new 2 year lows in the next couple of months
short at the open . easy money.
The issue here is valuation. How much is this 50 year old company going to grow? 15% is pretty good....analysts think 30% a year for the next 5 years. I think that is a stretch. So how much do you want to pay for each dollar of free cash flow? Company generates roughly 5 billion of free cash in a good year. With 1.27 billion shares that is roughly $4 a share. Put a general business transaction multiple of 10 and you have a share price of 40. Top brand premium 20 times and your at 80. THE STOCK TRADES FOR 140!!!!! Okay split the middle....still the current price is ridiculous. Needs to drop 20 to 40 to look attractive.
Risk everything.....lolololololol...

The biggest problem with Nike's move with Kaepernick is that people cannot buy sneakers with EBT cards. How do they imagine they will make up the lost revenue from the ex-customers who have money?
I'm selling
I'd rather run in CROCS than wear another pair of nike's
Stores are closed more then a month so what is the reasons for rise?
How can Nike make ads that say stand for something? Kaepernick does not stand for anything he stands against American and against patriotism

"I always try on the best of each brand at the local sporting goods store. Nike and Under Armor are always the worst fitting and seemingly cheapest made. Point is, Nike should be more worried about r and d than politics, as the Brooks and Asics of the world are eating their lunch. In fact, I would say that the Kaepernick debacle reeks of desperation, as they have realized this fact themselves."
T R U M P ! T R U M P ! T R U M P ! MAGA!!!

"Taxpaying fathers were buying a new pair of Nikes for their kids at the start of school and at the start of each sports season. When you have two to three kids that adds up to $1,000+ a year.

"""Kapper"" didn't sacrifice anything. He continued to collect his multi-million dollar paychecks, even when he became a bench player due to poor playing performance. He didn't give away his contract or his money. His NFL career was washed up, and he shrewdly started a new one in politics. He's making much more money from Nike now than he would have ever made as a flag-waving patriot. ""Sacrifice""? I don't think so!"

PE of 68? I guess you need to do something to justify it or improve it...even at the risk of cutting into sales. People talking more about the controversy than the products. No good
Hope my 47.50 puts for this Friday work out for me. Anyone else agree?
"I like how Nike acts all sensitive to causes where people act like they are underprivileged or treated unfairly, but pay their oversees workers slave labor wages. That's always fun to think about when Nike commercials show such heartfelt messages."

"Goodbye Nike, it was a nice run! Considering my first ever naked short here."
"After the US flag remarks by CK, it was the last straw. This year for the first time in over 20 years we bought zero Nike products for our grandchildren. Adidas, Under Armor and all the rest were fine for Christmas and birthday lists, just no more Nike. Nike’s decision to support this flame throwing fool just provides him with a platform to make mean spirited and inflammatory remarks. The Nike management never learns....and now this latest hateful lunacy. I’m just one guy, but Nike will never receive another nickel of benefit from my pocket as long as they are paying CK while he continues to spit on his own country and fellow citizens. Grow a set Nike!!"
the real NKE commercial:https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/1037570926437720064
I've been buying Nike products all my life. NEVER again. Not ONE item ever. I wouldn't wear Nike if they mailed me a free box of customized products. Bad choice guys. Real bad choice.
"Oh Freddy, I',m talking about the food stamps you get, the vouchers for the free lunches for your kids at school, and that check you wait by the mail box for once a month with the statue of Liberty on it. You freeloaders will never get it. That is why we won the election!Your welcome!"

"When the announcement was made the stock sold off....for a reason. If investors thought this was a good move the stock would have moved up immediately. The on-line ""sales"" increase is rumored to be free-bees granted to employees only if the offer was redeemed on-line. If that's true the ""on-line sales"" are non-existent. Supporters are calling the price rebound ""proof"" that the public is on-board with the campaign. I look at the price rebound ON STEADILY DECLINING VOLUME and say ""RUN"". If 83% of the stock is held by institutions it will take months for them to adjust. All things considered I would expect to be BEARISH."

I think big money interests are going to prop this up as long as they can. They will trade it back and forth for pennies to make it look like they are winning over the foolishness of the decision. Just my opinion.
Been shorting since 82...hopefully it crashes like Colin’s career
Find it funny how Nike is getting political when they exploit cheap labor in third world contries.

"Buying the dip. All these NKE haters hate the company for moral reasons, not because of its finances. Say what you want, this company has made me rich and I own a lot of NKE gear. I expect lots of thumbs down for this comment but the haters will still be here when this company reaches the 170s and eventually 200. Only then they'll be hating themselves for not buying at these prices when they had the chance. Most NKE haters probably would rather own Under Armour and make no money. I never let my morals dictate what I invest in unless the company does something like commit fraud. Bring on the thumbs down....like I give a rat's behind what haters think."
Only thing Kapernick ad will do is drive NKE down.

this is what you get for pandering to the angry mob
After tonight’s game this goes down for sure
"People are letting the huge companies and popular media influence their decisions. Instead of doing what is right, they just follow. It is amazing that Nike has chosen this path of evil. Oh well, just the further deterioration of America....."
WOW people actually believe that those trailer parks buy Nike gear too funny educated consumers are the ones Nike after not Trump followers.
my amazon nike order came to $275..... great investment in the first amendment
Nike's next plan is to sell only shoes that go on your left foot.
Boycott woke Nike. Body slam it.

People who want Chinese made sneakers are opting for HIKE or NIRE sneakers at 1/2 the price of nikkes.
NKE till date has only lost 6.3% in stock price from its 52 week high. How’s that protest working?
"NO NFL IN MY HOUSE, NO NIKE, WHO'S NEXT ?"
$65 by Q1...I sold before ER
"NKE is being teed up for December earnings. Kapernick effect will hit hard. UA is a buy at $21.75 but in 2015 it traded in the $90 range, peaking at $99 and change with a growth P/E then came an earnings disappointment and it plummeted to $11 in about the time it took to write this. Buy NKE at these prices if you dare but with a PE of 60, the Kapernick campaign ticking off at least half their buyer base and half their income from domestic sales it is a high risk small reward buy.. A twenty to thirty per cent drop in domestic revenue, even a ten per cent drop will cause NKE to drop just like UA did. Bank your gains now. NKE puts in December.will be profitable, not the stock."
If Colin Kaepernick is running Nike now would it not be prudent to show him all of the designs BEFORE spending the money to manufacture them? Finding Colin does not approve AFTER the shoes are done is wasteful.
Let's make Bill Cosby the new face of Nike!!!!
"Just the beginning of NIKE sp decline! Boycott NIKE, I am!"
"I just read another post that mentioned Lebron, MIchael Jordan, and the idiot Kapernick. Look at what Nike does for endorsements while it pays its slave laborers nothing and will not bring any jobs to where most of its customers are living. Michael Jordan (former NBA player ) $100 million for endorsements. LeBron James (NBA player/LA Lakers) $30 million payments for endorsements.Cristiano Ronaldo (Football player/Juventus) $30 million.to endorse their poorly made products.Kevin Durant (NBA player/Brooklyn Nets) $30 million to promote the Nike brand. Tiger Woods (Golf player) $19 million to wear Nike baseball caps and shirts. Hundreds of millions of dollars to people that are already millionaires. But no jobs for Americans. Why is this brand so popular in a country they totally rip off except for a few stars that are already rich?"

My wife and I discussed this and we are making this an example for how we can fight back. All 4 kids will never see another nike product again. And it feels good!
nice day NIKE LONGS...... LMAO
bring this company down!!!! short :)
Wonder how this will play out
What happened to Nike this afternoon is why Warren Buffet can't find anything to buy. This thing has done much more damage than people thing. And Nike has done a great deal of damage to themselves. I sit here and type this wearing Asics and my last pair was Under Armour (which I didn't like) but I will wear shoes that hurt my feet before I will wear Nike
Boycott NIKE; you can live without those converse or nike shoes. Remove NIKE from the DJIA.
Nike stock is worth about $25-$30 per share
Bluetsunami isnt the guy who flips the burgers at mcdonalds.Hes the guy who stands in front and begs for change.
"I must admit this stock is amazing with the price support it receives. The largest contraction of the economy ever announced was made this morning, the NFL is shutting down, the NBA is shutting down and quite a few people are refusing to watch them both as they continue their social commentary when what the nation wants is sports not social commentary from a bunch of spoil primadonna athletes. We're in a confrontation with China the primary market for Nike's growth, expansion and manufacturing. It has a PE of 60 and it is only off $0.20 as this post. That is amazing, not based in reality, but amazing."
Breaking down. P/E ratio is outrageous will test 60’s by next earnings imo...
Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano on Monday said he finds it impossible to believe that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York will not at some point indict President Donald Trump.

"Colin Caepernick has never done a thing to engage the police or help to improve the situation with police in the inner city. He just complains and takes advantage of the situation.Then he allies with a company that is known for supressing workers in China. This company won't grow, if anything sales will become specialized - only ghetto dwellers and ultra liberals will buy Nike."
You can't value a company like a growth company when it is mature and has no growth.
NKE is down 5.47% to 63.76
so how much down on this news? I'm guessing 5% tomorrow and then another 10% last of the week.
That boycott is really hurtin'. From $75 per share this time last year......

"Anyway, getting back to Nike. Adidas has new gear inspired by the movie ""waterboy."" Love that movie! Nike will have a gear inspired by Antifa and anarchists."
It’ll be an interesting study in macroeconomic marketing with all the hype it’s getting.Safe to assume that if Nike misses their 4th quarter numbers — many heads will roll...

My significant other works for Nike. I will never buy this stock knowing how incompetent their management is.
Good buying opportunities

I don't buy from Nike anymore.

"Consumers just ""Don't Do It!"". There are plenty of other sports apparel companies which do not elevate riff-raff to be spokesmen for their products? Expect Nike to start running football commercials with Ray Rice talking to OJ about how to deal with women .."
"By the time you hear Donald J. Trump being sworn in for his second term, with his majority house, senate, and supreme court, Nike will be half the size it is today in market cap. Watch and see. This was an epic and very ignorant business decision, that I for one will laugh in their face as they fail. I want them bankrupted in the end."

"I didn't watch any NFL but heard there were no Nike ads with Kap in them, is this true???"
Where are the Colin Christmas commercials
it just me or does this chart look extremely bearish. 130 and 120 support levels. if those break going to test 105. 140 resistance if not broken even worse. Price to sales record high at 6. 10 yr avg is 2.5 Price to book at 20. what the hell! it was trending at 4 for years. So much fat to cut here when bubble pops
Too much meddling w politics for my taste. Just sold and out. Stock May do well long term but the company is too messy: social justice narrative on US end... child labor on international end. Not supporting this BS
The last thing anybody needed this last year was overpriced shoesI doubt this changes going forward
Buy Under Armor!The CEO spoke the Truth! And Libs turned against him!
Is it true NIKE just signed a deal with Cosby for a new just do it ad campaign ?? I am not surprised at all if this is so
"Short, short all day long!!"
"Kaepernick is worth $17 million, not counting the Nike deal. Thanks for your sacrifice."
Nike will drop like a rock when investors get their first dose of reality. COVID-19 has crushed earnings! Look out below!!
Nike shouldn’t be allow to represent our Olympic teams !!!!! Only true American companies should be allow the honor!
"Anti-American support:""Ex-CIA Director John Brennan and former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad joined a strangely diverse chorus of support for activist Colin Kaepernick after Nike made the unemployed quarterback the face of a new ad campaign."""

Nike should be $25 a share max.
nike....pays millionaires millions to wear their products and those sweatshops that do all the work get paid peanuts. Why not give the millionaires peanuts and pay the sweatshop workers millions?? That makes much more sense.....
"I dont get it. Earnings are only up to end of january. 80% stores back in china doesnt mean they have customers, you can open stores and burn cash. Finally, the flat numbers of new patients in South Korea, which is closer to what we expect in the US, show that the virus is still kicking after two months, and people will avoid stores and crowd for a loong time to come"

I respect their right to express their views but not while we are paying them to work for us. I assume that they respect our right to boycott if we don't like their views. It seems to me like Nike should be in the business of promoting shoes and Ford should be in the business of selling trucks and not taking sides in political issues. You can bet that Nike and Ford are trying to position themselves on the cutting edge of the future so that they can make more money. Only time will tell if they succeed or get hurt badly.
Last chance to bail....NKE

don't be fooled by the 3rd and 4th quarter profits. This is already set by retail orders placed months ago. The 1st quarter next year is when the fall will come.
The liberals will try to push this stock up the next few days to try and save face. The burden will be to much and eventually it is going down.

With a 37 pe ratio you longs must've been on some strong reefer or other delusional medication. I hope this anti-American company collapses to $40. Thanks.

"History lesson on Xinjiang (Xiyu). Going back 2000+ years, 36 years Before Christ, China fought wars against the Huns there. A Chinese army attacked the Huns in what today called Aghanistan and killed the King of the Huns. The Chinese general, Chen Tang, sent the head of the Hun king back to the Chinese capital (then ChangAn) and asked the Emperor to hang the head in the area where foreign embassies were located. And General Chen wrote:""Let it be clear: Whoever offends the mighty Chinese nation will be destroyed."" -- Book of Han.There were no Ughuirs in Xiyu then. They were relocated there by China 1200 years after General Chen's victory, around 860 AD."

Nike owes America an apology.
MAYBE STACEY CAN GET A JOB AS THE NEW AUNT JEMIMA MODEL
Kaepernick finally found his job as CEO of Nike. This has to be the ultimate case of PC police run amok. Should do case study on downfall of Nike.
I would be embarrassed to have the NIKE logo on anything now!

It's not the 13% who have all the $$ to buy stock in nike. Us folks with the means and common sense and who fully support our police and a civil society will not buy their stock or their overpriced k-rap.
I purchased slot of Nike clothes in the past. It never again
"Big sale next week! NKE $69 and ""pig"" socks 75% off. America is great again!"
"I guess Nike has been listening to LeBron to much. How about addressing the Black on Black violence in Chicago, over 1000 people have been shot since Memorial Day alone."
"Wow, down 6.8%, worst DOW stock...This trades like a dot com bubble stock bursting. LOL"
I haven't bought a Nike product since Kaepernick. I would have bought a pair of Betsy Ross sneakers and now I hope Nike goes bankrupt.
"Nike, like liberal main stream media, continues to under-estimate just how much the average Joe on the street detests rich sports players using their employer time, and the American flag, to protest social injustice. Certainly we as a society need to continue to improve race relations, wealth gaps, and more. But making a hero our of this Colin dude is a huge mistake for Nike. Short this stock now I say, market over-valued, Nike already had a great run, and yes they will feel the burn of making this guy a hero."
"Nike is now the Proud sponsor of ""Resist"", ""Antifa"", DEM's and ""BLM""This will become a case study for business classes on the importance of knowing who you base is."
"Better get all Moderate Democrats, Independents and every Republican to the polls and voting Republican! These Dems even get the house this market will continue downward for a very long time back to Obama’s worst levels. Early voting is open go cast your vote Republican today and we can keep our tax cuts, get better health care, win all trade wars, get permanent and additional tax cuts and watch the market skyrocket to all time new highs."
Can't wait to watch this stock today
"Here is a company using stock buybacks to fake performance (like NKE IBM APPL so many many more). Their long term actual sales are declining but they pump the stock with stock buybacks. This company has a self inflicted black swan event, K commercial, that will hurt sales forever more. This is one strange company"
So they're saying Nike didn't tell any retailers or shareholders they were signing Kaepernick. This is going to end really badly!
"In ten years, Kaepernick will be broke and unemployed, and end up on one of those reality TV series that follows wahed up, burned out, formerly famous people."
didn't see a drop in nike coming .. lol... lol.... lol.... there is no other direction after their failed ad campaign
remember liberals see criminals as victims
I've never boycott anything before until now. I run at the top level of Marathons and get a lot of free apparel and several brands. I will no longer accept Nike apparel. We have a choice and so does Nike. Not supporting an unfair and divisive person is their choice. They may have got a bog bump from a few clueless Millennials to bump their weekly online sales (not overall sales) is not sustainable. Long term we will stop this attack against our military and cops. Supporting Michael Brown over cops is wrong and unamerican.
Get ready for this to drop big time. Nike crosses the line

"Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing over $10 Billion Dollars of NIKE Investors Money."
Over the last 72 hours this has happened. Under Armour stock up over 10% and Nike stock down in the red .50%. Liberals get cashing in your foods stamps and your social security checks and buy some Nike stock. We can't let the Conservatives keep winning..... All they do is win and we need to get of our mom's basement and earn some more money protesting people. Raise your fist and help our fellow man Kap!
Nike is going to announce bad earnings however the Nike nuts and Kaepernick supporters will carry the day stock will go up for a short time frame when that surge is done ... crash 20 points or more based on reality buy your puts when that initial surge of Kaepernick supporting nuts are through buying
Lots of growth expected from Nike this year.
Nike is an un-American company that needs to be taken down. Democrats are fueling the flames of racism... THEY are the ones CREATING racism.

"I just bought some shoes yesterday for my son. The sales girl was showing me some Nike shoes and I told her I don't buy Nike. From her impression she was not surprised and didn't even question why. It's obvious plenty of people are doing the same. Future numbers will drop. You can say they sell a lot international and that maybe international sales won't change, but it is still not good to lose close to half your customer base in the U.S. Sales will fall noticeably."
watch the rise....then watch it Fall! 
wonder why retailers have ADIDAS at the front of their stores and nike at the back with even Underarmour in front of nike..... they always put their best foot forward is always the game in merchandising......... go look what retailers are doing.....GO LOOK..... ENOUGH SAID

Kobe stuff -sold out --- huge gain for stockholders - stock is flying.
Buyback pumping on weak volume ran out of gas. Heavy selling into the close. Classic sign of pumping job gone bad.A bigly swoosh down coming for this stock in due course.
I wonder if the Nike insiders didn't have puts on this stock as this was announced. Doesn't make any sense.
a time to buy this?
"As a former Fortune 500 Corporate VP of Marketing and Strategic Development and FORMER Nike shareholder, Here is my take: Nike has made the Corporate strategic decision to be a ""Political High Profile Company"", believing that will drive sales and therefore profits. They must believe being politically active will gain them the favor of the younger generation and minorities. That might be true, but I do not personally believe in the long run it will pay dividends to the shareholders. As a shareholder, I feel betrayed by this decision. I don't care about the whole thing with CK in regard to investing. What I did care about, before I sold their stock, was the management team at NIKE making sound business decisions that would lead to higher stock prices. THIS DOESN'T QUALIFY and leads me to believe their sense of social consciousness has gotten in the way of their business sense."
No more Nike for my family...
down a billion dollars already....lol. I wonder how much they pay krappanick
Whats the chance this closes over $85 on friday?? 0% or 0% ? Bring it up so I can short it!!

Lets see what would it take for me to buy nike again? Nike would have to apologize. They would also have to donate 10 billion dollars to wounded warrior project. Sign veterans and cops and have ads with them in it. Then I may consider buying Nike again.
"No gifts will I ever give that bears the name Nike. I gave up on the NFL because of this guy. The thing is these NFL players take a knee 1 minute per game, 16 games a year for most of them. This equals 16 minutes a year these guys pretend they care. Why not take a knee for the millions of kids whose fathers walk away from the kids and their mothers. These are the kids who can be helped the most. Stay and have some fun with the kids"

"NKE like every other stock has huge gap ups and down in how the market is trading. Technically speaking, that would say NKE should fill the lowest gap from $62.50. Also on the upside gaps it needs to fill. I guess the question is will this continue higher to close those upwards gaps sooner than later."

"Hmm, I used to wear Nike gear before they turned against me as an american and tried to divide us. I haven't worn the gear since their racism and hatred was exposed. I saw the ex president of the USA Gymnastics solution and it works for me. Use a sharpie to black it out. I like the shoes just not the company.

Chinese hit list is much more dangerous than a supply chain disruption to Nike. China is now a huge portion of sales and the only growing segment for Nike.
why am I not surprised nike has Satan shoes?
"One may think the Chinese boycotting is a temporary thing. No, it is not. Sooner or later, Chinese are going to launch discrimination investigation and/or lawsuits against those who refuse to use Xinjiang cotton or hire Xinjiang workers.

A discount won't interest us, I wouldn't take a NKE item for free. Had to lose the corporate shirt business. Who is going to walk into someone's office in Houston and offer a guy a NKE shirt?

"BLACK PASTORS SLAM COLIN KAEPERNICK’S ‘HARD LEFT POLITICS’ + DEMANDS NIKE KICK HIM TO THE CURB“It has been clear for a long time that Colin Kaepernick’s views represent hard Left anti-American politics,” said Owens, a civil rights movement activist who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.“They don’t represent most Americans, and they don’t reflect the outlook of most African Americans,” he added. “By caving to Mr. Kaepernick’s negative opinions of America, the Founding Fathers, and the woman who designed the first flag, Nike has aligned itself with a radical anti-American viewpoint.”https://eurweb.com/2019/07/15/black-pastors-slam-colin-kaepernicks-hard-left-politics-demands-nike-kick-him-to-the-curb/"

"Well ... Trump doesn't appear to be too concerned. In an interview with the Daily Caller on Tuesday, Trump explained his hands-off approach.“I think it’s a terrible message,” he said. “Nike is a tenant of mine. They pay a lot of rent.” (Forbes magazine estimated earlier this year that the amount paid by Nike for its retail space on the ground floor of Trump Tower likely generates about $13 million a year.)"
Nike produced the strangest story. They intentionally alienated a large group of customers to seemingly secure the inner cities and liberal crowd. In a way I appreciate it because through the years I was supporting this company and of course wouldn't touch a Nike with a 10 foot pole now. But it still is a fascinating story. They were getting some of both markets and decided to destroy one in favor of the other. Had to have done a ton of research that indicated they could come out ahead. I would have never thought so
Just an incredibly poor business decision regardless of your personal position. This should not have happened.

Quarterly output fell almost 4% between late 2007 and mid-2009, the last recession.The shutdowns are concentrated in the most populous counties, which produce a disproportionate share of the nation’s goods and services. Eight in 10 U.S. counties are under lockdown orders, according to Moody’s, but they represent nearly 96% of national output.“This is a natural disaster,” Mr. Zandi said. “There’s nothing in the Great Depression that is analogous to what we’re experiencing now.”The analysis almost certainly underestimates the total hit because it looks only at the lost output caused by the abrupt closure of businesses to date. It doesn’t consider how much output will be further lost due to additional demand-side drops from higher unemployment and the loss of household wealth on household and business spending."

"I don't care for an advertising campaign that disparages any group of Americans. Or..like #metoo, assumes guilt in situations without clear proof.

so NIKE thinks it's ok to upset 50% of the American people and it will be ok with sales..... we will see how this plays out...... sounds like a desperate move with the affects being good only short term.

"The NFL’s opening Thursday night game got disappointing TV ratings for a league that is battling perceptions of rapidly declining popularity.NBC announced a 13.4 overnight rating for the Super Bowl champion Eagles’ last-second win over the Falcons.

Nike's earnings jumped, too, as innovative product releases plus the shift toward direct e-commerce sales pushed profit margins higher by almost 2 full percentage points.CEO Mark Parker and his team said in a conference call with analysts this week that investors should expect more modest profitability gains ahead due to rising tariff rates and a planned increase in spending. But executives still see Nike hitting its growth targets while outperforming on earnings.Let's take a closer look at management's biggest takeaways from the past year.A woman jogging.Image source: Getty Images.Winning with innovation In any environment, Nike's foundation for success has always been great product. -- ParkerSales growth held steady at a 10% rate to surpass management's guidance. If executives had to boil down that success to one factor, it would be ""innovation."" New product launches like the React and Air Max shoe platforms delivered more than 100% of sales growth for the period, CFO Andy Campion said.Taking different perspectives on the growth, the consumer discretionary giant noted the strength in the China market, which expanded sales at a 22% clip and now accounts for more than 15% of the global business. The e-commerce segment posted transformative growth, too, with revenue jumping 42%.Expect more spending ahead With Nike's unrivaled scale and resources, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities ... to invest and extend our leadership and competitive advantage. At the same time, we're also increasingly offsetting our incremental investment through the editing of resources within our legacy operating models. -- CampionNike said investors can expect to see more aggressive spending moves like the recent acquisition of data analytics company Celect. Management sees these moves as a great way to use Nike's unique competitive advantage as the industry's biggest, most profitable player to extend its dominant position.The good news is the company can still improve its earning power thanks to rising sales prices and cost cuts elsewhere in the business.Better days ahead While the geopolitical and macro environment is increasingly volatile, and in some respects unpredictable, consumer sentiment for the Nike brand remains incredibly strong and consistent around the world. -- CampionManagement sees plenty of reasons to be bullish about Nike's short-term and long-term growth opportunities. These include the steady stream of innovative product releases, the development of a more direct relationship with customers through loyalty programs and online orders, and Nike's outsized opportunity in China, which has expanded at a double-digit pace in each of the last 21 quarters.These positive trends are being offset by trade challenges and slowing economic growth in parts of the world. And Nike is directing more resources toward its supply chain, marketing, and manufacturing abilities. Finally, exchange-rate shifts are pressuring reported sales and profit gains.Despite those issues, management raised Nike's growth outlook and predicted that sales will likely accelerate when compared to fiscal 2019. Profitability will rise a bit faster than previously stated, too, in terms of both gross and operating profit margins. Executives made it clear that they only see this improvement as a small step in their wider plans to take advantage of huge opportunities in places like China and in product niches like women's wear."
NKE has been DOWNGRADED from T/u/rd to a Pile of Kraepernik
I'm giving my Nikki's to the homeless. The Nikki brand can be a symbol for homelessness. Kids will flee from the brand if this happens.

Might soon be a buying opportunity. Nike shoes at the Dollar Store.
Nike CEO is wrong and he will pay price for bringing a dead issue to the front.
have not bought nike products for a very long time and will not buy in the future...who cares if they lost money
Nike will represent the non-patriotic for the remainder of my life. I served and resent people who didn't serve who disrespects our country. Nike and all who hate the US should simply leave. I am short selling Nike because I believe that most Americans have finally had their fill of unpatriotic Americans.

It appears Nike has opted to make a quick buck on a Hot Button issue without regard to the loss investors will suffer. I for 1 of millions am getting out and cutting my losses now!
"On Friday, March 26, a pair of sneakers set the internet ablaze. It all happened when the multi-media account @Saint broke the news of an alleged collaboration between rapper Lil Nas X and MSCHF dubbed “Satan Shoes,” which is said to feature a custom pair of Nike Air Max 97s with 60cc ink, one drop of human blood, and a $1,018 price tag. And because they are being called Satan Shoes, after all, the sneaker is said to be limited to 666 pairs when it’s expected to drop on March 29. The shoes, naturally, have quickly caused controversy — and Nike wants nothing to do with them, the company tells Input."
I wonder how Nike and Kaepernick observe 911?
Short NIKE stock folks! It’s going lower! Make easy money!
This is only day one
I hear Nike changed their ticker to BLM. Perfect.
Thanks to Brother Colin!
71.50 might be way too conservative of a target.60 seems more likely!! or 50??
Analysts and Cramer are pushing this stock to the limit for some reason.

"too big to fall huh, ask titanic! ask Starbucks!"
slowly going RED..... haha
The stock is being propped up right now but the earnings wont lie......
"Nike was about $66 a few months ago. If you think this company is worth $100B let alone $128B, you're in for a wake up call soon."
"HERE IS THIS PROPHET GUY WITH MORE STOCK TIPS, HE ALWAYS SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER THE FACT IF ONLY HE COULD SOMEHOW BUILD A TIME MACHINE HE WOULD BE RICH ROFLMAO"
Sales 40% off and the lowest profit margins in the last 20 years. This is going south.
I hope the keep Kaepernik as their spokesdummy and build more momentum on this downward spiral. NFL related revenues will fall through the floor along with other pro and college sports with abbreviated or canceled seasons. Goodbye Nike.
I buy about $800 per year in Nike golf balls. I lose several every round. I’ll buy Taylor Made or Bridgestone golf balls now. They’re just as good. Maybe better. It’s not a big deal..... Golfers stand for the National Anthem.....The PGA tour is big with veterans. Nike Golf will take a big hit.
Run the Colin ad....it will boost sales! Not for Nike of course.
The American people voted for Trump and the investors are voting today.
"America is great again, Nike is on a downward spiral and mares is unhinged. Life is good."
Whose Human Blood is it? I wonder if the Whips come with bits of Human Blood on them? So Ironic the products of today's Chinese Slaves are cherished the most by the children of U.S. Slaves. I burnt my Nike products 10 years ago after I saw how they were being made.
Shareholder lawsuits in 1...2...3...
Nice to see the liberal global company NIKE continue to fall lower and lower. Just do it!
I'll never buy any Nike products again until they change their politics.
"I am 100% against what Colin K is doing and I think Nike is making a big mistake supporting him. I don't disagree with his support of minorities, in fact, I agree with what he says regarding racial inequality. But don't desecrate the American Flag and what it stands for by kneeling. I have a 14 year old son and his views are much more idealistic than mine, but to my surprise when we were buying tennis clothes for him, he opted for the Under Armour brand saying he is ""down with Nike"". Nike seems to think that their younger ""target consumers"" won't care about the politics...if my son is any indication, they will find out the hard way they are wrong."
"I know I'm going to get slammed with thumbs down but shouldn't this be falling further after-hours? Nike is up year to date and up 22% from one year ago. It's very close to the all-time high. They missed the already low estimate by a lot which may not be a huge deal because of the virus and all the people staying home. But how are they in better shape than they were at the beginning of the year? And how are they 22% better than 6/25/19 when the virus didn't exist? I would say there's uncertainty about when they will completely recover and have the same revenues as before the crisis. It could be quick, perhaps by the end of the year, but that is not a certainty. If this drags on and unemployment remains high those people that buy Nike products may just opt for cheaper shoes. I haven't bought shoes for my kids, who usually go through shoes quickly, for months because they don't leave the house much and it looks like school in the Fall will include remote learning. My job has shifted to work from home going forward so I will need less shoes and apparel.This could be just a blip on the radar but I can't see any reason why Nike is better off than they were one year ago and 22% is a huge advance from the price of the stock one year ago."
A low class stock for low class people. Easy to see.
NIKE stock down 5% so strong.Do I get a good stock trophy for minus 5% ? LOL

Nike May do great but will lose some customers forever. I know many!
RENAME THE COMPANY KRAPERNICK'S...JUST DO IT!
Nike is just booming. Been s great week for you longs!
"At best, that is all Colin sacrificed … some money and it’s debatable if he really lost his career over it. Maybe he sacrificed the respect of some people while he gained the respect of others. Or maybe he used one career to springboard himself into a different career when the first was waning. I don’t know. What I do know is, he gained popularity and magazine covers he likely wouldn’t have gotten without getting on his knees or as you say, “believing in something.” I’m also thinking the irony is that while I am not privy to the numbers, it’s likely he gained a lucrative Nike contract. So yeah… that whole “sacrificing everything” is insulting to those who really have sacrificed everything.You want to talk about someone in the NFL sacrificing everything? Pat Tillman. NFL STARTING, not benched, player who left to join the Army and died for it. THAT is sacrificing everything for something you believe in.https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/taya-kyle-nike-american-sniper/"

"I am expecting this to be around $81 to $83 after ER. Considering price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, NIKE looks overvalued compared with the industry and the S&P 500. The stock has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 34.7x, which is above the median level of 32.8x and below the high level of 35.9x, scaled in the past year. On the contrary, the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the industry is 29x and for the S&P 500 is 17.9x."

No surprise Hollyweird and pro jocks love this. They are in for a rude awakening when Nike's quarterly earnings come in.
Company just announced massive drop in business and offered no guidance and trades only a couple percent off all time highs?????????

"I'm not into the politics, I don't care about who said what. I care about fundamentals, and Nike is overpriced and now invited controversy. Easy short for me."
"When the coming recession is in full swing no one will have the money to buy a pair of overpriced Nike footwear. I think 90% of America and the world are about to find out what they can live without, and Nike shoes are going to be on the top of the list."
LMFAO didnt I say Nike had to fill the gap from yesterday? And what did it do? FILLED IT. Its only up from here now :)
Nike disappoints....
Occupy a desk !
EVERYONE SELL AT ONCE SELL YOUR STOCK BEFORE THE BIG HUGE DROP.
Wondering were your hero Blasey Ford is? Oh yeah she is moving to New Zealand. You Libbys should join her there! MAGA!
I don't buy from Nike anymore as well! Never ever! This is a goner. Nice one time metoo publicity trick. Lets see sales in 1 year.
Earnings will be BAD very very BAD. $60 likely
Today Maria Butina “NO COLLUSION” court appearance. Her defense: She gave a head to get ahead !!!
Nike should have taken Trump's advice and hired Frederick Douglass as its spokesman.
"Think this is BAD,, wait until earning comes out,, Then the Next quarter after the Christmas sale are busted"

Boycott Nike and the NFL
The pro-Nike articles by the main stream press will be hilarious to read when Nike sheds another billion stock value in
Nike is going down
So riddle me this... Lulu Lemon's results were just as good if not better yet it plunged after earnings with a similar unup beforehand... why?
Strong buy as always! Target price $180+. C0Ngress just passed $600 stimulus = 3 pairs of Nike's per hood rat. Hearing rumors of permanent unemployment in ghettos = unlimited pairs of Nikes's PLUS more looting in the coming weeks! I LOVE NIKE'S MARKETING TEAM!
how soon till 60's ??? thanks kap and brilliant move nke ceo
Head of marketing and the board are looking at huge litigation costs. Today’s sell off is just the beginning .
Stock is over priced. Selling down to $25 per share!
NEVER BUYING NIKE AGAIN!!!!!NEVER!!!
Who thinks nike will drop after earnings??
Nike has almost reached the Dec price level of 100.
"No one will know the impact of the Kap campaign until at least 1 more ER. Not speculating on direction, just saying it takes time to see the results of a campaign like that. People that support it rushed out to by Nike product; think of it as releasing some pent up demand. those that don’t support it can’t exactly go out and not buy Nike gear."
"UA up big again, Nike is toast...."
Quarter ended 2/29/20. They did not include March long bag holders. Buy at your own risk.
Sold my 2500 shares right after the announcement ! This anti-american company does not deserve any support.
Trump DOW up massively since he was elected.Thank you President Trump!!
It's a decision between respect or not respect your flag. Nike chose to disrespect US flag. I am an independent. I respect my flag.
Hey Nike where the just do you Kap Christmas TV spots? Can’t wait for the earnings report! Have my short position in waiting for the Kap payoff!
"when the first store has protesters at their doorstep, game over for Nike"

Iran hailed Nikes decision! What does that tell you???
Why would any college program use Nike now? These programs are not going to tick off their patriotic and wealthy alumni. I guess Nike can be the official shoe of the local Antifa bowling league.
No Nike Kaepernick commercials on the games I've been watching... daddy NFL said NO

DIMS simply do not want America to be great.There is no other explanation for their actions.
NFL Viewing down 8% good luck running ads
Why is stock dropping? WTH...
Large stakeholders tried to minimize potential impacts by buying shares to squelch any thought this would hurt the company..The truth is republicans if only 25% follow thru on boycotting nike then the stock will fall huge...
"Way too early to judge this stock. Earnings will dictate the stock price, not politics."

oh geesh another RED DAY..... who would have thought.....LMAO
All Nike does is win

"ha! market down 1.4%, nike down 4.5%, that ad campaign must really be working!!! lol"
Whoever came up with the great idea of hiring Kraepernik and creating so much anti Nike sentiment should be FIRED!! Look at whats happening !! NKE is TANKING!! I vote for a new CEO.
BU BYE...

Watch Footlocker sales to get an idea of how Nike wlll be affected by this bad decision.
"Not an investor of NKE, not sure if the ad was well thought out marketing strategy, not throwing out the Nike apparel that i own, just never buying Nike again."

"This exactly what I said 2 days before...@Zee Agree but it can only get better from here. As you know few Analysts will turn Bullish on Nike overnight and this stock going into earnings. with so many positives like Digital Transformation, No ban on vapor fly shoes and Nike is going to Win court cases is what I’m reading..Now Upgrade is Done. More to follow though. Next thing will be NIKE will announce more products for upcoming Olympics and updates on investor forum (This week) news will Spike the SP. I wouldn't be surprised, if it hits $110 mark this week or early next. This is still a bargain below $105."
"By the way, additional info about dividends mentioned in my previous post. Holly Energy (HEP) $33.08 per share and pays 8.6%,($2.64) Sun Coke Energy (SXCP) is $15.95 and pays 10.26 % ($1.60). Nike is paying 0.96% ($ .90). You can sell one share of Nike and buy 5.3 shares of SXCP and get $8.51divedend for the year. Simple math and makes a lot more profit."

"The metrics I track indicate Nike's $128 billion bubble could deflate to under $90 billion within 1 year during a strong economy. During a weak economy, when a market pullback occurs, many stocks fall and some will go up, as money shifts into the most stable securities and small hands are forced to cash out. Globalist clothing brands that charge a premium for subversive messages will be some of the first to be gutted easily to 1/3rd of their status. Friendly warning."
Biggest blunder of all time by Nike!They will never recover their audience.
Nike is going to discover that not all publicity is good. Kapernick is a Sales Transmitted Disease. Implementing a marketing campaign based on an STD is not going to help your sales.
FOR THE RECORD I DO TRADE BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY NKE BUT RIGHT OR WRONG I WILL SHORT RIGHT BEFORE 4TH QUARTER EARNINGS RELEASE

Its not whether you agree with Kaepernicks views or not... this is about Nike's shareholders and the company decided to get politically involved which I strongly believe this was a mistake. Sell your shares to lock in any profits and buy back in down the road.

However, if you want to know about my ""facts,"" I have been in this stock since 2014 and had 1000 shares. I did enjoy the dividends and growth of this stock. As for being a consumer, I have been purchasing Nike products since you were probably a baby. I have been using Nike golf products since they ventured into that market. Let me ask you a serious question, did you just become an advocate of Nike just because Krap is half black and he supports vilifying police officers? Care to tell me how much you invested in Nike?"
Just do it. invest on NKE. its a great stock to hold for a long term
PRICE TARGETS ON NKE FROM as high as $173

Always a good day when you see Under Armour up and Nike down again. UAA is going top have an amazing next quarter while Nike will plunge after the holidays.Merry Christmas UAA holders!

How's Nike doing making back the $4 billion in market cap Kaepernick has cost them so far?
Nike has arguably the best max chart of all time. Just a huge spike up. Very steady and consistently moving in the right direction.
Hope the upcoming earnings are good and boost the stock up a bit. Will make for a great opportunity to short before the sales hit to the subsequent earnings report.
"nike has lost it's appeal. it's getting desperate and will try anything to get customers. the problem with nike is that they lost many of their devoted fans but now rely on the tide pod generation. good luck to them. hopefully they don't fall like target, kmart, sears, toys r us, radio shack, jc penny, etc etc etc...all those iconic stores you never thought would go out of business or struggle so bad that they had to close many of their locations."
I knew there was a reason I put my money in Under Armor last year. I'm smiling today!

NIKE is played by politicians. Does NIKE send their own people to visit China and see what is true?

Good Bye Nike. its over
Thank you for your money shorts 
had to go buy shoes today at an outdoor mall. Went to under armor first. Didn't see anything I liked. Walked by the nike store and went to rack room shoes. Then walked to adidas. Nothing there either that I liked. I then walked by the nike store again to the other side to the File store. Spent 200 dollars. I would go barefoot before wearing nike.
Because Colin is just wrong.
"Nike have a borderline monopoly on the “sneaker” industry, not the shoe industry. Earnings will be great. Also surprised P/E is this low for a great company"
Kapernick effect-Timber !!!!
Nike made a great move supporting Kaeppernick and the First Amendment
"I don't know that I would bet against NIKE. Since 1986, NKE has outperformed the S&P500 29 out of 33 times (it's about even with the S&P this year). NKE has only had 4 down years in 33 years of historical data. While the past doesn't indicate the future (markets are forward looking), speculating that this stock will drop substantially is a bet that I wouldn't take. In 2019, the largest ""down"" month with this stock was in May of this year, and that was only a 12% drop. A $10,000 investment in NKE at the start of 2018 would be worth $16k today. Despite what we may personally think about the corporation, this company continues to move forward in a positive manner."
How many times will the Kapernick ad play today?
"How’s the woke company doingNo sports, no sells, lot of guaranteed contracts worth hundreds of millions of woke dollars to payout"

Thanks Kaepernick! You are making me money on my short. Can't wait until the next ER!
"I'm done with Nike stock and products. I have four teenagers involved with sports and will not let them buy any Nike products again. Just because some people ""feel"" is invokes slavery. How about the feeling of everyone else you feel pride. Pride in the fact that this might represent the start of an end to slavery. Pride that the people who fought under this flag were individuals who stood up for everyone's rights and freedom. Stop trying to erase the past and spin it as everything represented the evils of slavery. Be proud of the that period in our history because it represented the start of the change for this country and the world."

Nike to come out with Blood Splattered designs next..
You need more Colin ad.....run the ad!! Drum up some sales!!
Thought Nike couldn't keep up with the sales after the ad. I will never buy Nike again.
I think this goes to a new 52 wk low!
Hurry liberals and sell your food stamps so you can buy some more stock so it doesn't finish in the red today. It would be pretty embarrassing with the Dow up over 200 pts today.
"Why would anyone state Nike is a Strong Buy?I mean come on, One would have to know there will be fallout,To what extent? Well we will have to wait on future quarterlies.The Market doesn’t like Uncertainty and will trade as such until defined................ace"
NKE stock price was high quite a lot just due digital sales increase but not body discussed organic sales and overall sales and profits volume increase yoy which is very important to justify stock price increase. I noticed that sales and revenue has not appreciated enough compared to increase in stock price more than 100%. It means its ratios and multiples are quite high on fundamental basis. It is a matter of road block for further rise in stock price.
"Nike is a global company but grew to what it is today because of America and its citizens. Nike has quickly turned its back on America with this new campaign. They have bet the farm that there are more liberals and anti-Americans world wide then there are freedom loving American Patriots. If they really cared about shareholders, they would stay out of politics completely and stick to sports. New slogan is Just Do Nothing."
Just brought back my sons nike sneakers to modells. Will absolutely never ever without a doubt ever ever buy Nike again. My Uncle was almost killed in Korea and my Great Uncle in the Bulge. I am so done with the NFL and Nike.
NKE isnt going anywhere.Shorting by noon.
"$136 today, yup."
"Nike has an over 70 PE, so it was already over-priced. Any negative news like Kaep being their spokesperson is going to send this much lower. IMHO"
"Investors got punished more than anyone else, -5% to -10%..."
Big mistake Nike - you are going to lose a lot of investors because of your bad decisions. Anyone holding your stock will lose a lot of money.

I wonder if Kraepernik will like the new Nike Crack pipe design that I heard they were working on
$70 end of week. $40 by mid 2019 when the impact fully sets in.
IRAN must be using some of that Cash they got from Obama. They must be so proud to buy this POS stock..
I would love to know what executive approved this. Knowing the stock will tank 30% by the end of the year.
Never again will I as a 3rd generation veteran and ex Peace Corps Volunteer buy any product either for myself nor my grandchildren.
I support your right To Protest !!I’m also telling you what I would do as a Long term Trader.SHORT NIKE and Dont Look Back....................ace
Down Down Downnnnn NIKE has benn KRAEPERNIKED
Either Nike fudge earnings numbers or they are Illegally releasing shoes on the resale market rather than letting them go for retail. No reason nike can miss when the economy is good but pull blowout numbers when alot of stores are shutdown.
Nike CEO needs to be replaced ASAP! What this guy was thinking? Why this guy gets into politics without consulting shareholders?
Nike stock keeps going down since they signed Brillo head.
and away goes NIKE down the drain

This isnt just a bad move for today.This a bad move FOREVER.Theres no taking it back.
"Oddly yet predictably, it's not mentioned on this board that in addition to Nike being called for a Chinese boycott, that Adidas is also on the list. Ten thumbs down please and thank you to my cowardly l'il stalker."
The 13% likes Nike because they can run fast in them. Like when they rob people and have to run away
$138-$140 tomorrow. Was the heck did the GREAT JIN DAK TELL YOU???!!!??Go buy yourself some NKE and make some money.
adidas is german but i feel more american wearing them than nike!
"Nike has become another flagship for hate, racism and divisiveness in this country. It is a good example of how outside forces are out to trip US up and help us fall.I love this ""my"" country and ALL its people along with its and their, faults and defects, it is still the greatest place on earth to live, although it is slipping into socialism. This is not the way to fix anything, it just makes it worse,GOD save US and help us heal ourselves. Lets All be American and Stand United.

5 day trend is looking like a cliff fall..... market up in Nike down.... sky diving with no parachute is not recommended!
Nike makes money by having the slaves in China make its shoes. Nike is for SLAVERY and lebron james is for slavery.
This CRAPernick deal will go down as one of the biggest corporate blunders of all time.
I told you jokers not to mess with banning NIKEl And as for the celebrities banning them they don’t pay for them to start off with!

Looking like people are buying from Nike competition. I'm thinking Nike isn't going to have a good earnings report
This stock will be $40 by Feb 2019.
"Winter is coming to Nike -- a very cold, broke winter."
This news should infuriate American shareholders !
"COntrary to what some of the knuckleheads were saying, our boycott is working. I am the one that was buying my kids shoes, not them. I WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO BUY NIKE. Stand up for people that are not trying to divide the country and disrespect our cops and military. This all started with a punk trying to steal a cops gun in Ferguson and a cop lost his job over this for no reason. Buy Adidas."
Now we can identify the snowflakes. They’ll be wearing Nike shoes.
An ad with John McCain would of suffice but Nike chose a nobody for a Labor Day ad. How thoughtful
Market green but NKE DOWN on HUGE MISS!!
Do not believe for one minute that sales went up due to Colin k. It did not. Nike had a few new products in the pipeline but at the end of the quarter you will see decline.
Why is Nike down... Welfare can't buy a second pair of sneakers in one week?
"NIKE SUPPORTS KAP, SO THEY ALSO SUPPORT DISRESPECTING AMERICA, HOPE NIKE TANKS TO ZERO"

"Burn the shoes, short the stock and raise the flag!!!"
Their sneaker is overpriced!! You pay 70% to celebrity advertisement !!! Sneaker is only 30% of the value!!
Where are the nike articles about millennials buying up nike stocks?
"My best guess is that this stock will tank after Q4 earnings are released, if not sooner. I think that the ""kneeling"" issue runs much deeper than Nike understands. They may get some new customers but tons of folks will never buy again. Really no reason to debate this here now. Let's just wait and see the proof one way or another in the earnings, not just the current stock price......"
"No professional sports airing, huge drop in profits, lower margins, decreasing sales. Stock is down 4% ytd. Stock market is literally in Super man mode"

"I don't have Twitter, can someone repost what Lebron Twitted the other day about record high."
Another nice NKE short setting up.You have to love these gap ups.
Expecting blowout earnings next week. As a customer I prefer Nike over Adidas and garbage Under Armour. Everybody sees Nike as cool. I’ve enjoyed handsome profits over the last few years as an investor. Nevertheless Nike may withhold guidance like so many other companies have in these COVID times and that could cause the stock to sink. But that’s an excuse to buy. Nike and Lululemon are my favorite players in the athletic apparel industry and both have made me rich. Must owns for those looking for easy money. Long and strong now and forever.
Maybe Nike can sue it’s customers for collusion like Colin sued the NFL.With Xmas around the corner there’s a lot of choices and Nike may not be one of them.
Red wave hitting Nike.
"Just down $3? The impact of trade war was largely muted in past. If NIKE raises product prices in future, it will loss in competitive market. If not, the $84 stock price is way too rich. The reality will catch up."

"A couple of days ago I bought 200 June 2019 80 puts at 5.1. So that is a $10,000 bet that between now and June 2019 that Nike drops below 74.9. We will see how this goes around Q4 and Q1-2019."
Let the Bidumb supporters take Nike stock from 140-70! Where’s Colin Zee boy?
hey it's only down $2 right now.... add another $4 fall tomorrow..... it's only $6 down by day end tomorrow..... LMAO
Institutional investors can’t trust Nike anymoreBeing woke is not investable
Just SELL IT
Large stakeholders or owners of Nike stock Hold their noses and buy more on bad news why ? Because this protects their billions invested in the stock because if they sold it would tank big. But make no mistake the big stakeholders simultaneously “EARMARK “ the stock for DISPOSAL. In a few days they will start to unwind their massive positions and Nike will go up LESS in up markets and down MORE in down markets as big holders slowly unwind their positions to naive retailers.Smartest thing you could do is sell on pros nickel and escape yourself relatively unscathed from this company whose stock is very expensive even before this debacle..Most wont listen to what I Am saying ignoring cold hard facts and common sense but all will remember I told them this when Nike is in the 60s in a few months..Disclosure:In have put options in Nike such that when it drops below 80 I make money over 80 I lose point by point... let’s see if I am right or wrong in a few weeks and months..
"Boycott,boycott,boycott."
NIKE does business with a country that commits biological warfare.
So what if Nike don't sell on AMZN's Platform. They don't sell on Walmart's either.
"Remember, if you're going to add your Nike running shoes to the bonfire you've already got going with your Harley Davidson, your Keurig coffee maker, your ""Made in China"" MAGA hat and any and all of Ivanka's ""Made in China"" fashion line....at least remember to take them off your feet first.Shouldn't really matter whether you do or don't seeing as how we got that wonderful, fantastic and beautiful (you won't believe how beautiful) seven years in the making, covers more people for less and was rolled out on ""Day One"" (Believe me) healthcare plan."
love buying stuff with a huge logo on it and paying double. also love clothes with big words on it.

I’m hoping a bunch of liberals will hold this stock price up just long enough that I can get a solid short position. Today will be the beginning of a long journey south for NKE pps.

Horrible decision and the only way to even begin to rectify this is to fire any and all execs who made this decision.. JMO.

Ask yourself why that happened. The same will happen here. The NFL deemed him to be toxic to the league for a reason."
People sell shares of companies that do things like this. Good luck. Nike must be in trouble to do something as risky as this. :-)

NFL and Nike have lost billions of dollars. but hey what do I know. I would hate to own this stock after they disrespected the flag.
this stock has just become a dog.
NKE has been a great stock for the last 25 years. The company has made billionaires out of the early investors. NKE is a story of great entrepreneurship. Let's just hope Trump flip-flops on his tariffs before he tanks the economy.

Has Nike apologized yet?
"For people who keep posting how great NIKE was in the last 12 months, you are just not getting it. Nobody is questioning Nike's performance in the last 12 months, people are questioning the future performance AFTER the latest Kapernick ad campaign. The latest result was based on earnings before the campaign, we don't know the latest result until next Earning Release. Stock market looks forward not backwards, and past performance does not guarantee future performance."
"Hey Panther, I though NKE was going to drop? Was tha another one of your NOTHING BURGERS?"

Bad earnings again. Same as last time Bad in the US and good in China. It seems like a trend. I wonder if the hate America campaign has backfired on them. I saw pumper after pumper on CNBC trying to put a floor under it Friday after earnings
Nike will be sacrificing everything
"Taking the boycott one step further, you have to wonder if people who are upset, don't just not buy the products, but go to their local retailer and say....hey you stand with Nike I'm just not going to purchase anything from your store. So it has broader implications."
NKE downgraded. PT. 65-67.
"""The Bad Stuff That the Stock Market Worried About Is Starting to Happen""For the first time during Donald Trump’s presidency, both economic statistics and sentiment indicators are missing analysts’ expectations. So-called hard data includes government and private-sector data on consumer spending, jobs, manufacturing and housing, while the soft stats looks to Fed factory surveys and consumer confidence polls.Anything that suggests cracks in the earnings and macro foundation would go down poorly on Wall Street. That’s what was happening Thursday, as Apple’s outlook clouded profit forecasts at everything from semiconductor suppliers to electronics retailers, and the Institute for Supply Management index miss spurred speculation the economy isn’t doing as well as hoped.For investors trying to read the tea leaves, two risks exist. One, that the market saw something the professional prognosticators didn’t. And two, that the losses piling up in financial markets become a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy, denting sentiment and impairing consumer and business confidence.“It’s psychology of the market, which now is that growth is slowing and it almost feeds on itself,” Laurence Benedict, founder of Opportunistic Trader, said in a phone interview. “Businesses don’t want to spend because we potentially are going into a recession. Overall, the perception leads into reality. ”"
Coming from the company who not only outsources but exploits countries with no child labor laws like indonesia

CNBC traders are saying NKE is cheap at this current price of $129. They recommend buying at this price of $129 today. Go NKE!
"Whether one agrees with Nike on the whole Colin Keapernik deal or not, the reality is that they have made a decision that MANY in the country disagree agree with. My guess would be half the population if not more. Many of these people will not buy a Nike product ever again. This will inevitably show in their earnings regardless of how big of a company Nike is. Could it result in missing on Q3 and Q4 earnings? Your guess is as good as mine, but either way this is not a company where I would place my investment at this point."
can't wait until the annual stockholders meeting.

"Christine Ford ,the new face of Nike.She would fit in well."

"NKE just pushed earning date back almost two weeks. Suggested reading regarding earnings date changes. An article from the Wall Street Journal....The Unspoken Signals in Earnings Releases....excerpt from that article....""shares of companies that moved up announcements outperformed the broader market by 1.38 percentage points, while delayers underperformed by 1.3 percentage points. To capture the broader market returns, the study used a benchmark from the Center for Research in Security Prices that it says is 99% correlated with the Russell 3000.In his study, Dr. So asserts that companies about to release disappointing earnings may choose to delay in hopes that underlying conditions may improve in the meantime, or that some other good news may occur that will soften the blow of the announcement. Similarly, he says, firms with positive results may want to rush the good news out before it can be overtaken or offset by any bad news.It’s fairly common for firms to shift earnings announcements by a day or two. It’s when companies reschedule by more than a week that investors should really pay attention, Dr. So says. That is where he found the highest correlation between positive and early announcements, and negative and late.""NKE delayed earnings announcement from 12/4/16 to 12/20/16."

Or here is another thought, take a trip to Dover Del and watch the C5's come in with Flag draped coffins of service members who were killed in action.

Nike is up 18% on the year. Making it a top 10% performing stock. If you like making money you should own Nike stock. 25+ years of performance and market share leader domestically/globally you name it. Don't lose focus because a small minority of non-customers are upset. Nike's has done their homework. Their global sales will be just fine.

"So the relatively small (certainly comp to a year's worth of revenue) group of supporters runs to the computer to order a pair of shoes. Then comes the 50% of their customer base they just #$%$ off. When the inventory climbs, thats them not buying. Then comes the 30% thats indifferent but still not going to wear a swoosh anywhere because its now the biggest symbol for the leftest leftist 20%. Way to go! This is the single worst business decision I've ever seen."
Tom Burnett should have been the voice of Nike:https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/2090919067584892
NIKE Down massively since Kraepernik ad campaign.FIRE EVERYONE INVOLVED RIGHT NOW!!
Biggest epic fail of since the new coke fail.https://gph.is/YZ8hB9
"The motto is ""Just Do It"", so I did it. Just returned $300 worth of Nike product to Academy Sports that was purchased for the kids school year. I guess Castro t shirts will be out soon as well as Pig Police Officer Socks with the Anti American swoosh on them. What else do you expect from a company using child labor to make a product."
Over valued and over hyped. Wait for 100 bucks
"Shoe burning -- in China , Nike picked the wrong country to wrong---"
Great move NIKE. Buying more today
The media keep hyping it but wait for those financials. Like attendance at the NFL games. It's going down.
DID SOMEONE WEAR NKE SHOES WITHOUT SOCKS AND DEVELOP SEPSIS? THAT IS VERY SERIOUS.
how low will it go?
Should be down 10% by Friday
"Dems rush in to buy , let the dems own the company --the trend is down---push it up 5.00 ---more of a drop later----"
Nike gettin' all political.
BOYCOTT NIKE
New Balance shoes made in USA and better quality as well
MILLIONS WERE WATCHING FOOTBALL ON THURSDAY AND STILL NO KRAPERNICK COMMERCIAL ATTENTION NIKE CEO WHY WONT YOU SHOW THE COMMERCIAL?YOU SAID KRAPERNICK WAS A HERO THAT WAS FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE?ONLY THING THAT GOT BEAT IN THIS FIGHT FOR JUSTICE WAS NIKES BOTTOM LINE
"Impressive leftest passion for a global company. Politics do make strange bedfellows. This passion will dissipate , like Nike’s profits. Long-term, Nike stock is radioactive."
No more Nike! Bought 6 sets of shoes none Nike!
I thought they would fall further due to the terrible fourth quarter results. I always buy New Balance an American Company.
Time to short this stock.
NIKE Longs like it in the but
Proposed on 2 knees
There were a lot people in fly over America that bought these shoes. All that's all over with now.
"Vanguard and Black rock Control this stock-----WINDOW to get OUT will get SMALL---sell EARLY , or go down with sears--- Disrespect the troops , the US flag---tools"
I love Nike but you have a 8% revenue grower selling at 26x 2020 EPS.....It was a buy at $50 not so much now....

"Tyrell, the entire market experienced a selloff yet only a couple netted investors gains in 2018. Nike is one of them. The stock price decline had absolutely nothing to do with the Kaepernick commercial. It doesn't take a genius. How do you explain the rest of the market since the ""commercial"" in your own words? I'd pay to hear/read this lol."
they have a new product line. Nike Knee-pads!! Soon you will be able to kneel along with the losers at the game!!!
s
LETS HEAR YOUR ANSWER MARS AKA MARES
you can buy any down day in nike and you will make money overtime.
I will never buy my children and grand children or my self anything from Nike
I buy about $1000. minimum of cloths and shoes and that is coming to and end and hope the rest of the country will wake up . Nike is done.
$90s after earnings call. Friday afternoon after close? Not good. That's Bury The Bad News time after hours on Friday. Look for this to go to the $90s.
I haven't bought a Nike product in years.......but will start now.
Yahoo censors make $1.10 per hour in India....more than nikke sneaker workers in China

The kneeler campaign was a huge success for Adidas and under armor
"prophet, some of those are expenses and will not keep nike in business without customers, the rest are opinions! Keep trying, you are doing a good job of being nike's minion. LOL"
"If Nike were to publicly apologize for hiring the Colin Crappernick symbol of hate and terminate his employment, admitting the massive marketing mistake they made, I might come back to buy Nike products again. For now I'm loving my Under Armor and Adidas."
Watch Nordstrom's on the open today. It is a foreshadowing of Nike when they announce earnings in December.
"Honestly, they could trash this ad deal right now, and it wouldn’t matter. Damage is done. The only thing they can do is fire every exec that has anything to do with this decision, and even then their is going to be a long short term down trend for NKE."
Markets highest ever. Thank you President Trump!!
"Hope everyone is still strong on the boycott. I just bought a pair of Adidas yesterday on sale. I usually buy Nike but am on a lifetime ban, when Nike went against me as a consumer intentionally I have no reason to every wear of nike products again. I swear to god, since they went against decent people I haven't worn any of the 6 pair I have."

American needs to send Nike a message. Stand up for America.
"First of all, I don't have any position in this stock, but I will let u guys know, I ask my friends in China, how's ppl reacting Nike banned Xinjiang cotton and their response is not good. A lot of Nike stores have any customers, same goes to H&M. Chinese are buying more domestic brands than Nike, Adidas etc. You will see huge hit on up coming earning report. GLTA"

Nike buying back stock in the after hours ! It's a mirage !
No Nike shoes or any other of their merchandise for my family!
I wish I owned shares of Nike...so I could sell it.
Maybe if Kaepernick got a haircut the stock would go up. LOL!
"Not only is Kapernick and the rest of those OVERPAID nfl players are disrespecting our Country, our flag and our Veterans who allows them to get outrageous contracts which they never earn. But Nike is being just as disrespecting as well. I have bought my last pair of Nike shoes and so has my whole family which is a LOT of people and throw in the friends who will not buy their junk, it has to put a kink in their earnings. Not only am I done with Nike, I am also done with any company that advertises on the NFL games. Let's get together America and let these jerks see how strong we can be."
They can only prop it up for so long! This will be down over 10% eod
"I would not care if they rightly changed leadership over this, I will not own Nike anything from here on"
"When Nordstrum announced earnings last week it dropped 21% on lower than expected earnings and it did not have a growth P/E of 59. Their P/E was in the mid twenties, very conservative. NKE has a growth P/E of 59. When th Kapernick effect is announced in December earning expect a minimum 21% drop meaning mid fifites and in the following days a drop to much more conservative P/E to reflect the inherent risk of mismanagement by the NKE corporate officers who picked a marketing campaign which alienated half their domestic client base. Risk and growth P/E's do not play well together. Risk brings a conservative P/E. NKE management is now a risk and a reason for a conservative P/E which reflects that risk of mngmt. sily enough to sign on to the Kapernick take a knee campaign. Growth P/E days are done. Look for NKE in the forties in 2019."
Cancelled our corporate account with Nike. Land's End now has our business.
"300,000 sell order @ 10:56 made the day."
Kapernick for President
Sunday night in Chicago rioters and looters struck again causing $60 million in damages. Retailers that sold work boots and shoes were not affected.

If you love NIKE shoes.....wait to buy them as they will be a lot cheaper soon. No true American will be wearing them anymore.
Liberals get out their and cash in those welfare checks and buy some more Nike stock. It's embarrassing to see the Trump supporters continue winning on everything!
NFL-NKE contract till 2028. Lots of Swoosh in the NFL for a long time!Football only one of many sports NKE involved in-not the only one. Good luck fantasizing though!
NKE is near a 52 week high. I'm expecting a selloff unless NKE absolutely blows earnings out of the water.
Nike will drop like a rock
JUST LOSE IT
just wait till people protest in front of stores like Macy's. game over
Way tooooooo undervalued. Should be no less than $165.00 a share.
Bid and ask between $70-$71 tomorrow?

"As a longtime shareholder, I continue to be thrilled with Nike. How much would this be up if we weren’t currently in a Fed induced bear market? $85 per share plus... I will gladly continue to add in the high $60s & low $70s. This should be a $200 billion company in the next 2-3 years. Haters have been hating for years while Longs continue to make money. Best of breed."
Guess mares had to look for a job today...thus no posts from that tool
I don't own Nike shares or Nike shoes and never plan to !!
Maybe time for a 2/1 split. Still long & strong on NKE. Been here for years! Plenty of room for this stock to go higher if viewed as a tech & direct to consumer play.
nike will crash soon
Nike shoes are made by young children who are hungry and live overseas
I for one am extremely grateful that my President is able to explain to us all what it was that people meant to say and not what they actually said.

lesson to NKE shareholders. M (Macy's) announced they were not going to be selling Donald Trump clothes. ask the Macy holders how that turned out. Was 62 a share day announced. The earnings dropped off the charts after that. On the other hand LGBT group boycotted Chik-fil-a haveing record sales since. Dixie Chicks gave our President heck over in France anyone ever hear of them again? Also Taylor swift became political and now her career going downhill. I could go on and on but no need I Prefer Under amour anyway

#justburnitWhy on earth would a company put themselves in the middle of a politically polarized debate where they could lose 60% or potentially 72% of their US customers?

"Time for consumers to drive Nike out of business, once and for all. I don't care if they eventually try to apologize for their anti-Americanism, we know that would be phony on their part. Nike is anti-American to their core. They will never change, so why EVER buy anything from them?"

"Nike down a few pennies, but the percentage decline is much less than the DOW and overall stock market. Bravo for your out-performance once again, Nike!You have swelled The Institute's endowment fund to a massive girth! Thanks to Nike, our endowment fund is well-endowed indeed!"
"I agree with him-elections have consequences and he’s finding out!!!Donald J. Trump@realDonaldTrump....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!"
"I can't wait to see Nike's next two quarterly reports. I'd really like to see Kaepernick announce it, knelling."
I see this as a slow burn for Nike. It wouldn't be until Q1 19 before this has any effect on earnings. Stores long have their holiday orders in. If there really is a backlash it will be felt by holiday buying. And Q1 wholesale orders will be down. The NFL is taking a beating over this kneeling thing. No one cared about Kap until now. I'm seeing the pro Kap crowd is much more an anti-trump crowd vs pro Kap crowd. The pro Kap crowd will forget about this in a month or so. But I have a feeling there will be a large silent majority who won't. Who will simply buy other brands more over the next year or two. A few million upper middle class households silently avoiding Nike could be costly.
I’ll never buy another Nike product unless they reinstate our flag. Something interesting online. We wanted to get a pair of gym shorts for our grandson. Nike shorts all over the place but had great difficulty finding an alternative product. Could it be that everyone else has the same idea and that explains the glut of unsold Nike products?? We can only hope.
Order complete. Almost 17 years of holding onto this baby but I dumped my whole position because this will hurt SP and I just don’t want to own a company with this kind of agenda. To each his own I guess..
CY ITS NOT GOOD ENOUGH IF IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND BEETLE JUICE AND COMPANY WOULD BE CALLING FOR RECOUNTS ACROSS THE US
"I’ve been long Nike in the past and currently only own a small amount. Epic company that will continue to crush in the future. I’m hesitant to buy in anytime before their next earnings (which will much more accurately tell us how they’ve been affected by COVID). That being said, I know their e-comm sales are currently smashing prior year. Just not sure that will be enough. With no pro or college sports (or sales related to that team business), no olympics, etc... it’s going to be tough. On the flip side, tons of consumers buying athletic and “comfy” gear for new life. Nike always manages to figure out a way to win. But you can see my conflict. This is a must own stock from a return standpoint IMHO, but’s it’s just a matter of when to get in. It’s already come back very nicely. But the coming quarter is REALLY unknown."
"NIKE closed at 84.79 before Earnings and closed under that for 3 days after earnings.Thats 1 2 3 strikes and NIKE is out.It cant even gap with market and if market sells the news, NIKE is FINISHED!!"

this is a company that abuses children in sweat shops. somehow liberals still use Nike to spread their evil message.
Thanks Nike I will just do it by buying apparel from other companies.
"I’m not burning or throwing my Nike shoes and shirts away, but they are going to be my yard and paint shoes and shirts! I won’t wear them out in public"
Nike stock lower than price before krap deal. LOL
"I have many Nike shoes. I will not throw them away or stop wearing the, but I will certainly not be buying Nike for my next pair....I can't imagine why they would take such a position in a highly controversial subject/person. Crazy decision on behalf of the Nike management team. Wow"
Let’s make America great again
Glad I don't own any Nike stock. I just went threw all my Cloths and threw out the Nike stuff. I love America. I just did it.

What rocket scientist at NIKE came up with this marketing plan? Hope he has a good exit package.

I am a short but the conference call appears to be very optimistic for longs
UA up almost 20% since kap ad. Nike down almost 20% since ad. Coincidence?
"The leftist media is cheering for anti-American, anti-police, pro-communist Nike today. But that's all fake news. Half of Nike's USA customer base is GONE, and it won't be coming back. Nike's share price will go below $50 within 2 years."
Just don't buy it!

"Better not hold on to this one too long boys. You still have some time to play with it, but Nike will head south big time once it becomes clear as to the permanent damage. Not exactly sure when that will happen between now and Q4...."
Anything near $81 tomorrow is a gift that will be very rewarding. Got in the last time this was by the 50day and it was a great run up from the Kapernick low.

And they are the market leader along with LULU. Bottom line, all I care about is that I’ve made big money owning this company and will continue to make more money well into the future. This company is a cash machine."
Ya'll are hilarious with the negativity. Nike needed to strengthen its position with its target consumer the 18-30 yrs old. The millennial generation is attracted to organizations with a social cause. Millennials are the one that spend $100+ per pair of shoes and by multiple pair of shoes a year. They are not worried about the 50 yr old that buy shoes at the outlet to mow the lawn.

Email the company. Go to Nike's site and click on contact and email the company. I did and I asked for the ceo and the entire board to resign since they don't care abo9ut shareholder value and instead promote politics.

"Our family will never again buy a Nike product. If Nike believes disrespecting the US Flag is OK, and rewards that behavior, then they don't need my business or any friends that I can convince as well.There are times and places for disagreement. This is not one. Disgraceful!"
JUST SELL IT
Have not owned Nike products in decades. Over priced. Toe box too small in running shoes. Not really a good lifestyle example. Now they are into politics. Not smart.
I see this stock going through the roof in June. Any less than $175 today is undervalued.
"Nike is going to be 200 dollar stock, nothing stops consumers buy best and needed products within their tight budgets of a middle class family in the whole world."
Look at that Dow moving. Looks as though the Trump economy will set a new stock market record very shortly. The Dow is so good even Nike should move up a dollar today.....

"Nike, Tesla and many many others have jumped in bed with the communist PROC. I have zero support or sympathy for them when the communist government steals from them and ultimately harms their business. The USA has replaced manufacturing jobs with service industry jobs which have wiped out the working class. You can’t raise a family by dumping French fries  into the fryer. However, the US government is trying to mandate the wages necessary for non skilled fast food workers to live a middle class life. That ship set sail for mainland China 30 years ago. Just look at the abandoned factories and blighted neighborhoods."

Pretty soon Nike's will be like Members Only jackets. People will laugh at you for wearing them.

gonna listen to my gut next time. not you guys who look at previous earnings report to predict the latest one. smh.
"I went to buy a different brand of shoes and t-shirts today at lunch. I have always been an absolute Nike nut throughout all my years, to a point of craziness. I was not looking forward to it because I have never even looked at or considered other brands. To my surprise, I found a couple pair that looked great and so did the shirts. At the checkout counter, an old man ahead of me was buying a pair of Adidas. He was having a conversation with the clerk about how Nike was supporting the kneeling to the flag. He was a former marine and was 87 years old. I thought to myself, what have we become that an old man that actually served his country has to go get a different brand shoe? The deterioration of America is real and very sad."
Kaepernick was a hail mary

Face it. NIKE blew it. Down it goes. Lessons learned
"You think, Tutes wont be in this thing for q4 earnings. I agree"

SO strong buy NKE,"

S&P 500 (^GSPC) was at 1600.00 with better fundamentals and higher corporate earnings in 2016. Now it is sitting at ABSURD 3700.00 with TERRIBLE Fundamentals, Collapsing Economy, HEAVIER Corporate and National Debt and way lower corporate revenues and earnings!The World Countries are refusing to accept the US Dollar as international reserve currency due to the HEAVY Dollar PRINTING!US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! US Stock Market is a MEGA BUBBLE right now!!!The US Government is PUMPING Oil Prices artificially, DESPITE Shrinking Demand and Exponentially rising supply! Oil price went up from $1.00 to $60.00 in no time FOR NO REASON, thanks to FED.

I have been watching this circus. And I'm going to short this thing in a few minutes.
Nike supporting LIES from the left.
Made in China?
Can you sayyyyyyyyy Boycott...........
Going Downnnnnn!
"If there is anything like sure money short NKE. I did. I will never watch another golf, football, basketball game thanks to NKE. The players should cancel their contracts with NKE and quit with the logo. The problem is that they are all greedy and want the cash. I will not respect any athlete that wears a NKE logo. I will not be watching sports anymore so I wont see it. United we stand and divide we fall. This is the most BS I have seen in my entire life. My shoes are in the trash can burnt to a crisp. We can put NKE to rest as short the stock to #ell"
While NKE and every stock is pumped to the moon ask yourself why Democrats ARE AGAINST VOTER ID. Every nation on earth has some voter ID. NOT AMERICA.WELCOME TO THE NWO.
"Not good, not good at all. Take a knee, Kap! Boycott Nike!"
"Pre-Covid the share price was about $100, so currently I think it is overvalued. Market correction is imminent, so the price will fall. Anyone looking to buy should wait until it is around $105."
"Not sure why this is down, was pretty good given delays at the harbors"
This stock has zero reason to be trading this high considering there might not even be football this fall
Hang up your moral high-hat and jump in! Joey loves China and so should you. More importantly Boomers and every parent on the planet needs laceless entry shoes. It's the way of the future. Dividends and dollars. Done.
"With big NIKE t'shirt Williams is complaining that the women rights had been violated. Female players have the right to call the officials "" #$%%$#%$^^"" WAY TO GO NIKE"
Nike screwed the pooch and anyone affiliated with them be it a customer or shareholder is in alignment with their endorsement of Colin.
Serious lack of proper judgement. Shareholders should sue if the stock tanks.
"Some questions for LeBron James:1. What exactly is your definition of ""systemic racism"" and in what systems does it exist? Everywhere? The NBA? In the neighborhoods where you own multi-million dollar estates?2. Why don't you live in communities you claim to care about, rather than presumably systemically racist communities?3. Why didn't or don't you send you children to public schools in communities you claim to care about?4. You say there is voting oppression and suppression taking place in the country. Exactly which voting locations are you talking about, have you informed the Civil Rights Division of the federal Justice Department (these would be federal civil rights violations), and are you aware that the voting locations and related decisions about the voting process are mostly made in the counties where the precincts are located? In other words, are you accusing minority public officials of oppressing and suppressing votes in their own communities?5. It's well known that you are a Democrat, that the organization you've help fund to promote voting is intended to elect Democrats, and that many of the issues you claim to care about involve matters handled by locally elected officials who are almost all Democrats. The Democrat Party is also the party that stood for slavery, segregation, Jim Crow laws, filibustered the 1964 & 1965 Civil Rights Acts, elected a former klansman as its leader in the 1970s, etc. Why aren't you calling for the abolition of the Democrat Party, or at least demanding a name change, and how do you justify your hypocrisy?6. Are the fans who pay your enormous salary through very expensive tickets, cable TV monthly charges, and buy your extremely pricey sneakers, jerseys, etc., systemically racist? Are the fans who are not systemically racist nevertheless being price gauged in order to subsidize your lavish lifestyle?7. You signed a tremendously lucrative contract with Nike; Nike does business in China, slave labor is used to manufacture products in China, and China is a genocidal communist regime that runs concentration camps and enslaves ethnic minorities. For all your talk about racism and oppression, isn't it true that you have enriched at the hands of one of the most repressive regimes in modern history?8. You infamously chided an NBA executive who tweeted a short sentence in defense of the oppressed people of Hong Kong, who are now suffering mightily under the iron fist of China's Communist Party. Don't you owe your fans, the public, and the people of Hong Kong a better explanation, especially when you hold yourself out as a civil rights icon?9. My producer reached out to your representative and the NBA to invite you on my radio show where we can discuss these and other issues before millions of listeners. We've not received any response. Please consider this a continuing, open invitation to have a frank, civil conversation."
NOW KRAPERNICK HAS A HAIRSPRAY COMMERCIAL

How does that market cap for NKE looking ?

only down 3%...... desperation by nike owners to prop it up..... should be -10% minimum very soon and 25% on earnings
Matt left because he can see the pain about to be inflicted on NKE shareholders.

Nike board considering new logo
Shorts have my permission to short this right here right now. I took 2 positions so far. 131 cost basis which I might trim tonight for tomorrow. Plenty of powder for tomorrow.

If NKE announced pro family or conservative values it would Spike to $90 Plus. But it's still down from the announcement and LIBS are at their peak excitement right now.
"JL, are you saying that people will not have money to buy nike urban shoes? LOL"
rug gettin pulled out right now...enjoy the ride bag holders
"NIKE TOOK A CLIFF DIVE, NO SUPPORT UNTIL 70.70 THEN NEXT LEVEL AT 0"
ouch!
"Finally a stock whose earnings Wall Street rewards. What an amazing quarter! As I've said before, Nike is the preferred brand over Adidas and Under Armour. It's what everyone sees as cool along with Lululemon. Been an investor for several years now and swimming in returns. I love the smell of freshly squeezed shorts in the afterhours. Delicious."
NKE encouraging racial divide. Thanks Nike!!!
Robert Kraft is wearing Nike

Does Iran have any teams that might want Colin?I'll spring for a first class one way ticket.
RED very shortly...... how much are those Long willing to LOSE?
If it smells like #$%$ and looks like #$%$ its a NIKE
only good thing about the markets tumbling today is that Nike went down as well
"In this negative environment when NKE announces earnings and misses due to the Kapernick marketing campaign alienating half the client base and costing NKE many lifetime clients, I estimate they will have lost about 10-15% of their client base based upon the decline in NFL ratings during the take a knee campaign but the NFL recoverd. There is only one NFL. Where can you go to watch a professional football game? Nike doen't have that option. There is Under Armour, Adidas,...etc who have and are welcoming the ticked off ex-Nike customers and they are not coming back. Nike is not the only game in town...In this negative environment the sell off will be vicious. When a company with a growth P/E in the high fifties misses earnings and NKE has very low earnings expectations for this quarter, the sell off will be ...... vicious, NKE will open down ten and continue trading down after earnings. Even after NKE has dropped due to the market sell off it is still way over valued and stock price is based on future growth. No growth...timber...vicious. We will see it in the forties and if no sales recovery in the thirties. . The market sell off is creating the perfect storm, negative environment seeded with fear for a huge reaction to a miss in earnings. Kaper quack, Jordan sales diminishing, overvalued and announcing into a fear based market. Sell off will be vicious. Just closed out fifty 75 puts. Will be reloading day before earnings based upon price of NKE day before will decide which strike price. Instead of puts they should be called Kaper calls.."
Go get educated on what happened to Starbucks when they became a political company. Their stock has never recovered
Obviously CEO must be smoking some good stuff to go along with this idea
Nike now believes they are bigger then the people who buy their products. Avoid !
I hear NIKE is going to licence Kap's pic to Charmin for their new flush-able wipes to recap some of their losses.
THIS JUST IN: Homeless shelters around the country not accepting used Nike stuff even they don't want to be seen wearing NIKE!
Glad to see this POS isn't recovering after management's Kapercrap blunder.......down from here along with cat suit sales.....
"Boycott Nike, they are on patriotic. Do not buy their products."
"Wait until POTUS weighs in, oh boy!"
"daniel, China sales are growing this week."
Seems like a lot of ppl don’t feel the it will move higher on earnings...
He's just not that good!.
Nike shoes will be littering the shelves of Dollar Tree pretty soon - if they don't get thrown into a landfill.
We'll be green tomorrow
Gravity is about to take hold of Nike
Nike go up $2 and SJW credit the genius Kaepernick signing. It down $10 now so tell me why? I be waiting.
"Ty-In September 2008, Don Jr. told a reporter: ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.... We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" This is an actual quote. Thanks."
"The price per share is not the problem, it is the revenue that will drop drastically. Those who are going to boycott this product happens to be those who have money and previously supported them. So much for that."
Lots of very bad stuff happened at Nike last week this is a way to get you to not see those problems. Tanking....
Never sell your NKE shares. Ever!
"No worry people,1st of the month is here.Now if they can only sell Nike in the neighborhood food stores they can use their snap card and the stores will just scan it as food.That would be a good deal.snap equals nike,cigs and beer and whats left over goes to the kids."
Will be $160 after earnings.
Cannot believe Americans are still buying this stock.
Gaps at 74.51 and 72.19 and Chart is showing 60s.SELL!!
"Ok, so as far as the pps goes, currently both ppl from the left and right have some valid points. But let’s consider this... with the controversy, is it not safe to say that there’s enough concern from investors of the controversies impact that we shouldn’t see the pps increase much higher ..at least until confirmation of the impact is fully revealed? I would think that a certain amount of caution in investors would prevent the stock from running much higher.... Thoughts?"

So where does it stand now ? They said Kraepface was the 6 Billion dollar man.What is he now? The minus a billion man?
Everyone Sell!!! Do it for your country!!!
Nike is now a liberal brand that has no value or standards!
Whoever is about to have a short career in marketing should have taken Jordan’s advice about who buys their sneakers. Why would you throw out your customer base pretending to care about human rights when your profits are driven from exploiting child labor in cheap markets? This is going to make an awesome Harvard Business Review.
Under Armour is totally making all that got out of Nike and went to them.... Over 25% in one day! amazing return on our money RED TEAM!
Has Nike ever been a moral company?Nike. Just Burn It.
"nike & the nfl, a pair of LOOOOOSERS"
Time to vote! Vote nikki nike and Colon down down down. Swoosh goes the stock price.
Monday night football and nobody is watching
Nike just made Under Armour a buy!
"NIKE is flying high now.. but it's on it's way out. I was shocked to have a few friends recently tell me when their existing shoes wear our they're not buying Nike again. It's because of all the Kapernick/BLM stuff. I sold my Nike last week and put it into Tesla. I'll make way more money on Tesla anyways. Long term.. Nike is going to see a slow decline. And believe it or not, I really do think Under Armour is going to get much of the defectors. Yes, Under Armor is on the ropes right now. But so was Apple in 1997, almost bankrupt. Anyways, not trying to argue, just verbalizing what I see going on around me."
DOWN GOES NKE PAID PERSON SERENA! ANOTHER BIG LOSS FOR NKE. GET USED TO IT.
They can't pump enough air in this bubble to keep it from deflating
IT WASN'T JUST THE NFL THAT TURNED COLEN DOWN...McDONALDS DID TOO
I NO LONGER will buy nor Support Nike.
Sell
Nike owns Hurley and Converse
Nike doesn't honestly care either because they're majority chinese-owned. Kaepernick and the tariffs on China will be the end of Nike.
"Earnings almost back to pre-Covid. pre-Covid, stock was at $103. This is a crazy valuation."
This POS stock is going back to 50. It’s well deserved I might add. CEO should resign.
"LOL!Yes, just do it!https://www.foxnews.com/us/nike-says-all-stores-in-the-us-to-close-to-limit-coronavirus-spread"
Many stop losses will be tripped tomorrow
How long will NKE continue buying their own shares in an effort to keep the pps up? It's a no win situation for them.
My $85 short still safe. Thinking about adding to my position.
Thar she blows....below 80. Buh bye.
DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN....WHAT'S THAT SWOOSHING SOUND?
Nike has essentially committed corporate suicide by alienating its core customers. The worst for the share price is yet to come. The Nike swoosh is now widely regarded as a symbol of hate much like the swastika.
"Very strange that a company would invest so much in an ad that has nothing to do with the product itself but rather to make some sort of anti-police statement. I currently wear Nike and New Balance. I will not ""burn"" my Nikes (which is absurd) but I will most certainly never buy another pair. There are plenty of alternatives."
"I went to Academy today after work to buy a pair of non-Nike sneakers. I saw 4-5 people taking about the Nike boycott and buying other brands. When I paid out, the man at the register said that they had a mad rush today of non-Nike buyers. If that is true, which I have no reason to not believe what I saw and heard, Nike is in trouble down the road with this new Kap campaign....."
"Obvious attempts here at the start to minimize the downfall, but in the end you cant prop this one up....."
Wow. If market keeps falling nobody will be able to afford $200 shoes
Rush Limbaugh is paying off Veterans mortgages with Betsy Ross T-Shirts.That's gotta chap Krapernick to no end!!
"swoosh, down the Krapper"
I own a lot of Nike products. Thanks to this company I now feel like a fool wearing them. I’m not going to NOT wear my current nike products anymore. I will just look at other brands when I need new stuff. Companies need to learn to stay out of politics.
"If the big boys want out, as proven by yesterday... then they need you in. MM playing you like a fiddle today."
how does NKE announcing after hours effect Fri ex options ? would be bad to lose money a put because NKE annouced after hoursmaybe a law suit or 2 if they have something dramatic to report.
"Haa, I see the stock slowly moving to red now."
Liberal Logic: we have $13 trillion of Socialist debt in the form of social security. Solution: more socialism!

who thinks this wil go down in the $70's again?
and let the NIKE DISASTER BEGIN
SHORT THIS TO UNDER $50
"most of nikes business last year,came from China sales. Turning off Americans has lost sales here. Satan shoes and China shutdown will further the drop this year. With competition high in this area, Nike has lost its base.Buy puts/ short"
"I like Dan Nathan, but he WRONG about NKE....it has run from $85-$95....it is MORE than fully valued here! It is sooo far above the 50 day average it WILL RETRACE!!!!!!!!"
"Calculated move by Nike to team up with an individual who dishonor this country and all the men who fought and died to protect him making millions of dollars. Nike knew that most shoes are bought by young people, but failed to realize to the money come from their hard-earned conservative parents who will boycott Nike (I am one of them)."
I founded Nike and Deckers Outdoor to be 50% of my portfolio. Both have an huge upside.NKE and Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK). IMHO.
Wow ! Talk about a CEO getting his butt over his head. I sold and I am buying puts. Thanks for the gain. No one should put their shareholders at risk over their personal emotional decisions. There was no need to do it and it is close to negligence to politicize the company over a personality that is not well received in the market place by a majority. If the CEO does not care or feels this is the time to be a maverick he got it wrong. This is now a BOD issue.Sometimes we need a reason to sell and refresh. Thanks for that.
"Now, Nike has a Ronaldo problem.https://www.yahoo.com/sports/dont-just-nike-handle-ronaldos-billion-dollar-contract-now-024822897.html"
"$ 3,750,000,000.00 (That's $ 3.75 BILLION DOLLARS) lost market capitalization on September 4th...Share price trending down pre-market September 5th....Shareholders must be very proud of Nike's decision making capacity. Just Do It....."
"Nike has made it ""cool"" to wear sneakers again. Not wearing Nike will say so much more about you than wearing one. This is the most brilliant marketing strategy Nike has ever deployed. Everyone will have to wear Nike to show that they STAND for equality, integrity, and justice."
"Oops.LOL at Nike-Kaepernick, Inc.!"
NIKE is real Trash.It cant even get a decent gap up on USMCA
Wonder when Nike will listen to its shareholder rather than some inept has-been football player?

here comes the cliff ...... look out below
He had a Super Bowl Ring in the BAG and lost it. Is that what they mean??
Does anyone know if Nike has apologized for disrespecting the people that pay their salaries and buy their goods?
Used to tee up a Nike golf ball w my mind focused on golf. Now the logo would trigger a storm of controversy and I'd lose concentration. I can't have that. You're doing this to try to make money. Play fake 'do gooder' somewhere else.
gonna take weeks before nike really feels the pinch. but it's coming
The owner of Papa John's makes a true statement regarding the NFL and the board of directors kicked him out of his own company. I'd like to see Nike do the same thing.
Reason the stock is down today is a downgrade by Citi....I still think the future for this company is rosy. The end of the Kobe Bryant contract and the challenges outlined in the report to me do little to make me wary of buying here. NKE remains the best selling athletic apparel company along with LULU. If you think I'm selling NKE to buy the garbage UAA that's like you thinking I'd tend to beehives without wearing a beekeeper's suit. NKE is the gold standard and will remain so...the haters say I'm corrupt for investing in a company where slave labor allegations exist....I'd rather be rich and corrupt than poor and resentful the way these haters are. NKE will keep going higher despite their objections. Only an idiot believes they'll get any meaningful returns shorting this.
NIKE fell through a trap door and into a bottomless pit helpppp
"When does CEO Mark Parker get to ""Give it up ""(his JOB) "" for something he believes in"" (Kapernick)?? time is over due Parker??? Going down with the ship? Stockholders will love that???"
In last 3 years year over year sales and earings did not improve much compared to increase in stock price by 100% rise. It seems fundamentals for P/E and P/S has been charged to higher multiple and higher stock price expectation. Or analysts have lowered the expected bar to meet or beat the expectations.
Shorting this to Bankruptcy
NIKE. Just sell it....
So far in AH up around $5.00... alot of action
Fire the entire liberal management team? down 15% since the Kaepernick debacle. So easy to buy Adidas or Puma instead
going red
Wow look at the Market go! NKE still DOWN :(

It's Veterans Day. Is Nike hosting any flag burnings?
Nike didn't lose drop by customers. They lost lifetime customers. People who had worn their shoes for 20 years and will never buy another Nike product. I had to doctor my existing pair to finish wearing them out. Pretty unbelievable
animals
finally up after buying when the stock splited.
NIKE Activist CEO is playing SJW with Investors Money !! Wow and now stock is starting to CRASHHHH
"""In the quarter ended in Feb, 2021, Nike brought in $973m in pre-tax earnings — a 75 per cent year-on-year jump — compared with $970m in North America.""So if Nike wants to take a political stance because The US government said so, then don't expect"" Eating China's rice while smashing its pots"""
Why isn't Vanguard dumping their load of losing Nike shares? They are the largest institutional holders of Nike stock .

After 3 seasons of getting slammed NFL has nothing to brag about.Billions lost wont ever come back.Good thing for them Legalized Gambling saved this season so far.
"This ""battle"" has just begun wait for earnings NKE"
"I bailed out of this one right after the uptick in September and have absolutely no intention of returning. After almost 50 years in the market, I do not like to stay with any equity when the management of any public company decides to make a political statement regardless of the issue.Capitalism and political issues rarely mix so I took profits.Dr. C ret."
Do fundamentals justify price? PE 100
"I have bought only new balance sneakers for years . They didn't have my size last time in Kohls where I usually buy them so I bought Nike . That was a one month ago .I'm wondering if I can bring them back , being a Vietnam Vet I'm embarrassed to be seen in them ."
The price that subversive companies should pay is crashing into nothing. Honoring and supporting America (USA Made) is true progress.
"I've got to question the managements decision making after this one. I mean, why get involved on either side? Run the company, stay out of politics. I've never been a fan of Nike, and even less so now."
Blue tipple claims he is stating fatcs then implies what others do fo a living! LOL
See ya Nike
I would pass on any Publicity that Included ‘Colon’ In it..................ace
Buying 800 shares tomorrow! NKE is going to $200 soon.
There needs to be a letter change to NIKE. As far as I am concerned the new letters are: E V I L
"Nike to announce new social injustice program called, ""Gibsmedat."" All pigmented people of colors can loot and steal ANY Nike sneaker they want. Should add $0.50 to EPS."
Booming stock market. Thank you Trump.
"Absolutely everything possible (within the limits of the law) must be done to sabotage -- CRUSH -- Nike, Crapperpimp, the NFL, and all ultra-Leftist/communist/anti-American/identity politics-based groups and organizations. If this is not done, and done NOW, America will suffer a worse fate than Cuba, Venezuela, China, or North Korea."
Only a bumbaclot wears Nike products but a winner buys the stock! Long and strong. $200 target.
"Check out that Dow, winning is becoming a fun time folks. Sorry if you have Nike stock though, not a lot of winning going on there."
"Oh don't worry...NIKE still has Kaepernick, who loves the USA."
Going down like Monica
glad my last pair i bought were adidas
Reality check will kick in tomorrow. Take your profits and run
The Kaepernick effect in action... down big time!
Amazing to me that Nike is up today. I would not be a buyer. A 68 pe and they just alienated a huge percentage of the population? Any slight miss and this stock will crater. Couldn't they have found something better to put money into rather than that giant brillo pad.
"These people make me laugh, don’t they realize everything that we were and use in our homes is made in a sweat shop!Wake up people or you will have ban every product that you use in your entire life and will wind up dying because of it!"

I sure miss those days!LMAO!!! https://youtu.be/7yo7wIn0bmw
Boycott Nike now and forever!
"What's interesting about this Nike boycott is that it is SO easy to execute because people have plenty of alternatives to choose from, unlike some other products and services where either you don't have a good alternative option or it's painful to switch."

"6% gains from short, thank you wolf warrior!"
I don't get it. I feel like shorting after economic stimulus. China: several weeks of shut down = no production. US: shut down = drop in demand. That's 2-3 months of either no production and not demand... can't be good for next quarter? Thoughts?

"IM NOT SHORT, BUT THESE NUMBERS ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT REAL. NOBODY BUYS SHOES WITHOUT TRYING THEM ON. NOBODY IN A PANDEMIC IS BUYING $200 SHOES. THE RIOTERS STOLE THOUSANDS OF PAIRS & NIKE IS CALLING THEM SALES. I KNOW PEOPLE WHO WORK AT FOOTLOCKER. THEIR SALES ARE DOWN 40%. NUMBERS ARE A TOTAL JOKE."
Nike sell off because of krapernick
I’m thinking the marketing people made a mistake with the K ad. I for one will not buy another Nike product as a result. I’m confident there are many more in the US are feeling the same. Only time will prove me wrong.

"Dear NIKE,Perhaps you should review the reasons your new hero stated for why he refused to stand for OUR FLAG!Here they are; ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" NIKE, in choosing Colin Kaepernick for your new ad campaign you are telling America YOU agree with his position and that you also will show NO PRIDE in AMERICA! NIKE, that is certainly your choice but guess what, many of us will no longer show pride in NIKE! Enjoy your ride to the basement."

"I rode the wave up last week pre-earnings but after this closure extension by Trump I’ll be out pre-market Monday. “Nike has offered to pay 50% rent on its 384 closed U.S. stores, landlords say, and when the stores reopen, a percentage of sales in lieu of any rent for 12 months. Nike executives said they will continue to pay workers while the stores are shut.“We are currently honoring all existing contracts with our landlords. In collaboration with our real estate partners, we provided a proposal looking at near and long term approaches that we believe will help ensure both parties remain viable business partners through this unprecedented time,"" a Nike spokeswoman said.”Great for long term loyalty to the brand to win back some Americans but terrible for the short term economic status of the company and shareholders. Til next time Nike, thank you."
nike must be buying back their stock back..... haha
Honestly with all this closure I don’t think they will beat their estimates but I could e wrong lol

Maybe if NIKE cuts a deal with their Crack Dealing Clientele they can come up with some extra cash for the Buyback
When the market closes up without a gap up the sell off will be over imo
Facing a sustained 10-15% revenue drop over the next 3-5 years...you'd have to be CRAZY to own this stock.
Nike turning it's back on our national anthem and all that it represents. I can't see how anyone can listen to our national anthem and still support Nike. It makes me sick to hear anyone take a negative stand against the soldiers and their families that sacrificed dearly for our great country.
FORD'S ENTIRE STORY IS TOLD IN 5 MINUTES...TOPS. SO WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? THAT IS CORRECT - POLITICAL ASSASSINATION.

Thank you Krapernick
I think these shares are worth $50 at most. This stock is in the stratosphere right now.
$110 this week.
"This has to be the poorest ran company in America. I used to be an AirMax loyalist, it’s been new balance and under armor ever sense. UA makes a great sleeveless tank by the way."

Nike sales up should be up for a couple days. Their customer base gets their welfare checks at the first of the month
This caravan seems to be a bunch of people who are good at making demands and stomping on our flag.
I guess the people that support NIKE aren't the ones with money :)

Nike competition is eating this news up. Great job by the individual who signed off on this disaster.
Nobody will be buying Nike this year.. They already looted 2 years worth of clothes and shoes..
"Hey Nike, hows those Kepatrick ads working for you? Never wear Nike again!"
took a gamble and they lost!
Very surprised with NKE reporting on Friday after the close. Usually all Friday earnings reported premarket. NKE always reports on Thursday after the close. Why did they change the timing of this earnings? Is there any bad news that they want investors to digest over the weekend? This doesn't pass the smell test !
The market they are playing to don't buy shoes they steal then
Have thrown out all Nike Products.....Never again

"mgmt somehow doesn't understand the consequences of an offensive marketing campaign??it's not a racial thing it's an American thing, whites, blacks, browns, reds, yellows, the men & women in Blue & the purples who love America or have served for America will never buy NKE again. NKE hates America and is willing to risk its brand over an ill-conceived publicity stunt is the only conclusion that can be reached from this."
Nike is too much a fad & social statement and not enough of a business.
NIKE will always be Kraepernik from now on.NIKE will always be the ONLY brand people will make sure they never buy again.
Class action lawsuit paperwork is probably happening all over the world in many law offices as i write this. Nike is going to get crushed by this. Short it to at least $15 buck.

I have a pair of glass ceiling breaking Hillary Nike shoes... anyone want them?
NKE is being played back for the bad message. They earned it.
NKE has always used slave labor to make its products. What is different about now than before? We seem to always ignore it since it’s in another country...
"Yikes. I'm a buy and hold guy. Confident Nike will turn it around in a week and my investment will continue to grow as it always has. It's awesome because any other company I'd be more than nervous. I mean our executives and senior management keep getting in ethics trouble, its well known we paid Kevin Durant and oodles of up and coming bball athletes to publicly say that kids don't like UA kicks in an effort to thwart our competition even if it wasn't really true, and now the Zion shoe blowout defect in the biggest game of the NCAA season so far! Literally, the only two people that this could have happened to that would have been worse is Lebron or Kevin Durant. I love this company. We STILL all know that the stock will go up and continue to grow. And I can't wait to see the next smear campaign we run against Adidas and Under Armour as we get back on our feet, and to watch how fast the Wall Street Media takes our made-up story and runs with it tanking everyone else in our industry while we prosper. Cocky and loyal to my brand for almost 20 years! Just Do it!"

Who is buying stock? There will be 10 times the number of infected at the end of April. So thats when we get back to normal. With 10x more infected. None of this makes sense. Is ti possible the general public actually thinks things will go back to the way they were? It will take years. The longer this goes the worse it will be. Wait til reality sets in. Keeping people employed based on promises. Crazy

Pretty sure I like New Balance. Won't be buying anything from nike.

"Originally they approached Harvey Weinstein, who would have been the more popular choice, but he had a full plate and fortunately Kaepernick was available so they were lucky to get him."
Pretty sure they already factored in the backlash to their stock price before making this decision. I know I would and Im not even in the corporate world.
The good new is we’ll win again in November and no looking back for 6 years

Nike (and all the other companies) really stepped into it this time. They tried to tell China how to run their country and now they're going to lose 20% of their gross profits now that they're banned. When are these companies going to learn to sidestep politics and just be a business?
"NIKE is a powe house there’s nothing that can stop this powerful brand, it’s like trying to ban Apple! Good luck to the people that are trying to ban this company! You all will be back to using their products shortly!"

"It was $65 with 9 billion in revenue with $0.68 EPS exactly same day in 2018. So, do I see $20 overpriced today?"
NIKE is playing up to the liberals to HIDE their human rights violations...period....
Roger goodell must be saying  oh no I should retire...
Looking at retailers today showing results I would expect NKE will be in the 50’s after reporting results in a few weeks. Probably about 65 before earning and $58 after.
"If a company is listed on the NYSE, it should be required to pay its global workers similar pay to that of American workers.Also, is not very environmentally friendly to ship product across the Pacific Ocean, and then across the US.If you are green, if you care about the environment, you should be concerned about the worldwide pollution caused global shipping. In the future, under socialism, as much product will be made locally, to drastically cut down on shipping pollution.Since under socialism, we won't be doing anything, anyway, except living in caves, and chiseling images on the walls."
I heard they offered Kapercrap a job cleaning Cosby's cell....

"EXCEPT FOR THE ""WORKING PERSONNEL"" AT NIKE, I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF THIS COMPANYGOES OUT OF BUSINESS...VERY UNAMERICAN!"
I’ll buy in at $45.00
Presidents Day celebration for tRUMP will fittingly be on April 1st.
Great looking shoe?? 4rh of july?? everything going GREAT?? till? Nike spokesperson/employee Colin Kappernick says HE NEEDS moew exposure??? Kap DESTROYS a great promotion?? 4rh of july promo? shoes already made? worse IN THE STORES?? and so Koo Koo Kapernick can get publicity??? Destroy his employer Nike? and Colin Cancer Kappernick??? Still has his NIKE job??? this is PERFECT Saturday Night Live Material....Nike has been KAPPED...how deserving
today is just the start of a long downtrend in this stock
Love Nike. Stock products and market muscle.
don't get how a clothing company can be over 200 billion cap...
Number 45 already at 45 today. Will continue holding the bottommost spot for several generations.
Nike is going to fall very hard soon when reality sets in that it's built on a flimsy position.
NIKE AT 74.20THIS CAN'T BE PROPHET SAID 75.00 WAS SUPPORT AND GOOD STOCK'S BOUNCE OFF SUPPORT
Why these comments lowkey racist LMAOOOO
What just happened?
Down over 3%. Great move Nike.
"Time to take the knee, longs, in protest of the falling share price"
Kraepernik Crashed NIKE
on a death spiral down......
mrhole muted
you know I went to a large high school wrestling meet over the weekend. I actually found it offensive to see several to see kids wearing NKE gear. I wore it myself before the KAP mess
colon crapernick
Fire this CEO OR PAY THE PRICE!
I heard about NKE the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
What did the Great Jin Dak tell you???? He told you NKE would come back. Now it is time for NKE to break the $200 barrier
A majority of the people on this board don’t realize Hillary lost. To Trump.
"""I'm boycotting NIKE!"" . Nike stock goes up."
It makes sense that Kap is the face of a company that exploits workers for financial gain
POOR KAEPERNICK NIKE DOESN'T EVEN WANT HIM ANYMORE
I would not want to have shares in this company !
No more Nike for me. Air Force Vet.
This may very well effect Nike sales. The backlash is going to be bigger than they think.
Company is desperately trying to keep share price up lol waste of ammo and shareholder value imo. See u at 70 shortly.
EVERYTHING GREEN TODAY AND THIS DOG IS RED AND STUCK BELOW 200 DAY MA NOT A GOOD SIGN IS THIS WHAT THEY CALLED KAEPERNICKING ?????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_bG3FCi-Jc
Trump should nominate Hillary to the Supreme Court so an investigation of her can finally get started
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A DRIVE BY IN THE TRAILER PARK
never buying another pair of Nikes again
It will go up today. NKE will be a $195-$205 stock by December.
$BANI is one to look into. How long will it be before this company and it’s product is featured during NBA and NFL games?
boycott nike
"the liberals on here are right. nike is for the urban crowd and they don't need us ""privileged"" people anymore. just visit the site and notice what color most of the models are. they are really targeting the urban people. good bye, nike!"
Great to see the Kap effect in NA. Many won’t ever buy a Nike product again!
a good company's stock shouldn't drop this much no matter if there is a correction or not. tutes are noticing people are angry with nike and know that just a small demographics will not keep this company in business.
4 more years
about to drop below $72... JUST DO IT..... LOL
This company is flipping off half of its customers . I’m buying puts all day long .. only a matter of time before it tanks just like the NFLs ratings tanked
I am long Nike but there is no way it should be this high based on forward or of 25 using the HIGHEST estimate for earnings. Crazy. I mean they better blow away high estimate this report or back down we will go. Crossing fingers.
offended by a flag......
"For those of you that think the Kaepernick ad will help sales, why do you think that? Why would people buy more Nike stuff because Kaepernick is in an ad? Thank you in advance."

Preview of new Nike ad
Timberrrrrrrr!!!!
This is fun to watch. What happened to that ad?
"Trump's approval at 34% in new AP/NORC pollOverall, 34 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s job performance in a survey conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That’s down from 42 percent a month earlier and nears the lowest mark of his two-year presidency. The president’s approval among Republicans remains close to 80 percent, but his standing with independents is among its lowest points of his time in office. https://apnews.com/dad8086738a64b4ba78c0404d5d04e79"

Tariffs on apparel . that includes shoes
Never invest in a company currently within a political dispute.
Krapernick took the money and ran....ran away!
@Karl - don't you love how the liberal media accused TRUMP of making up the caravan?
"MARES RELAX, HAVE A BAG OF DOUGHNUT HOLES, YOU WON NOTHING BUT IT'S GOING TO BE OK MARES MARES I KNOW YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BIG BLUE WAVE BUT WE WARNED YOU NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN YOU SET YOURSELF UP FOR FAILURE KEEP TELLING US ABOUT THE 500,000 SHARES OF NIKE YOU HAVE IN YOU'RE SIM TRADING ACCOUNT AND ENJOY LIFE ROFLMAO"
NIKE down AGAIN...Never Nike Again
libs and dimmocrats are lining up to buy nike products.
"Thanks, Nike! I will be donating my profits to conservative candidates running in the mid-terms."
"them know it all liberal millennials probably don't know what jack is taking about when he says clinton, cigar and oval office."
"Fonda, Keapernick, Nike."
Corporations should not take politicals sides. NIKE CEO may believe Colin is right in what he does but 50% of America don't. NIKE is thumbing their nose at those 50% and will lose their business. Stock ownership is made up of older Americans so it may be more than 50%. Bad move NIKE.
PE ratio is 68! and company is losing business fast!
"Combination of entire market rallying, short covering, and heavily padded earnings report. Take your profits and run."

Wasnt offered a job with Broncos after he walked away from contract to be a free agent?
100% discount on all Nikes coming up in the hood this coming summer
"LOL at the ""fade"" at the open. NKE shareholders deserved what's coming to them"
Best stock to short on the market. She will.probably settle around 50 to 60 when the next numbers come out. Lost about 40% of customers who actually buy shoes. Gained about 2% of people who loot shoes and have no money to buy them. Great marketing team.
"I was talking to some twenty somethings last week and they told me that Nike cares about their new and upcoming customers. I asked one of them how much Nike gear they have, he said he had several shirts and a pair of running shoes. I buy 2 pair a year and have probably 8 pair of running shoes and probably 6 pair of shorts/running pants. I started wearing Adidas and he will probably buy 1 pair of shoes in the next year. Nike loses for disrespecting me and telling me I don't matter."
I HEAR KAEPERNICK TOOK TWO KNEES TO GET THE NIKE JOB
this ship is sinking. slowly but surely
"I would take my maga years any day over society today. Gun violence, back stabbing, zero honesty, zero integrity. Company’s like this. Yes please give me my maga years back. When a mans word meant something. When people were proud of their country. When there was no back stabbing. When a dollar meant something. When people new how to sacrifice. Please give my maga years back."

We know they are going to give excellent guidance for 2020 so we just need an earnings beat to go up $105?
Down %3.2 premarket.
"New Frontier NewsBy Sherrie L. James, guest writerSaturday, September 8, 2018(NEW FRONTIER NEWS)- When Nike chose Colin Kaepernick as their new spokesman, the company engaged in an impressive publicity and public relations strategy, but their choice ultimately may become a devastating blow to their business.At first, glance, choosing Kaepernick seems like a noble and applause-worthy idea.A significant number of African-Americans, many millennials, and lots of others applaud this call because it appears that Nike is supporting a person standing up for what he believes.Yet the reality also is that Nike gets millions of dollars’ worth of free publicity by making this controversial choice. Almost everyone on social media will be discussing Nike’s brand and debating the choice for weeks to come.Nike likely will increase it its sales in the short term, even as their stocks initially may take a hit due to calls for a boycott of the company’s products and its immediate loss of a significant part of its customer base.In addition, people already have begun to question if Nike’s choice of Kaepernick in actuality was nothing more than a carefully designed ploy to try to ingratiate their company further with the African-American community solely for profit.Either way, Kaepernick’s choice remains a great publicity move by the company.But what about its effect on Nike’s marketability in the long run?By choosing Kaepernick and thus by default choosing sides on the kneeling debate, Nike has insulted, hurt and damaged its relationship with a substantial number…Read MoreThe post Examining the Polarization of Nike’s Choice appeared first on Tyranny News."
"OBOMBA IS CORRECT....RARE, NO? It will take more than one election to finally defeat all these demrats and get the real change we desperately need."
Backdrop to be used in Nike's new commercials:

"Prohpet, since you can't answer my question about Adidas's outpacing Nike in 2018 sales, how many shares of nike do you own? You seem to be adamant in defending Nike."
"Nike knew what they had to risk since it's all about the numbers/demographics. I'm curious to see how it all plays out. As a guess, I think they've easily written off 35-40% of the United States business and are hoping the globalization sales float them."
Selling short
"The chart is breaking down short term at least. I expect the gap to be filled at $72. After that, who knows. By that time it may have a started a new down trend."

Thanks Kap. I bought when your ad came out and knew it was the right thing to do. GO NIKE!!!
"Let me be clear: I abhor Nike the company on my principles as a good person. I stand against slave labor, child labor, Marxism, Communism, anti American movements and exploitation of poor communities. But I cannot sit idly by and watch the money pass my retirement portfolio by. It's only fair that if Nike's demographic which supports everything Nike supports and which I reject, buy their products, some of this money flows into my account."

RED WAVE COMING
I'm still waiting to hear exactly what he sacrificed. He turned down contracts from SF and Den because he thought he deserved more. And now he is suing the NFL which pays Nike for the uniforms. Quite the business decision...the NFL better do something.

"Today Nike gave away a mid tier NFL Franchise in Market Cap to support Colin Kaepernick. Jacksonville Jaguars or New Orleans Saints, take your pick. All this because NFL Defenses quickly shut down the read option and Kaepernick can't hit receivers."

NKE is the biggest gainer. Analysts have it as top stock to own in 2019
The company will maintain the customers it already has who supports this and will lose a great majority of customers who oppose it. Losing any amount of customers means less profits which clearly hurts shareholders. Stock will not rise but fall.

Stock price labor day about $82Today?about $80.Yet Nike is putting our PR statements about how the kapernick campaign drove up foot traffic in stores and sales.Lets see profits when the quarter ends.

"I had my doubts about Nike, but I'm glad to see them coming back after the bullies. Stronger company than I thought!"
1954 posts on this topic. A huge response. Wonder if Nike has gotten the attention they wanted.
how many millennials bought this after krap deal?
People don’t realize what backlash can do to a stock. Facebook perfect example.
"Panty, NKE will be $150 by June."
"Nike just doubled down on what they think is a safe bet that their demographic base will respond positively to. This is just the latest example of the bubble effect. People, companies so ensconced in a certain culture (bubble) they have no idea of the coming tsunami that's about to eat their lunch!"
Markets celebrate GOP still in control.
Nike board meeting
NA sales down because of KAP...big mistake.
Kraepernik the 'Minus' $6 Billion Dollar DISASTER

"The US gave the Palestinians $ 250.000,000 . the US will support the Uighur's , not caring what China thinks ?? so we have war , a cold war , China's tool--destroy the US corporation ---Speak bad of China , pay the PRICE --will funds sell at a discount to unload shares to another fund ?? when one fund sells -huge price drop--or volume goes up--sell 10million per week ???"
People must of lost a lot of money with Nike because Kaepernick's name has been spoken again. Buying Nike at $20
"Nike stock keeps going up and UP. They make great shoes (AIR MAX Sequent 4 Utility ) and I just keep buying and buying Nike shoes all the time with my feet issues improving, as I walk a great deal. Time to buy NIKE stock as it appears a win-win also. On a decent pull back, my wife and I are IN."
"board up your stores, the rioters are making a statement, you know the 'justice fighters'"
Wasn't NKE suppose to miss? That's what everyone was saying. Aren't we in an economic slowdown?
"Nike should focus on the Indian and SouthEast Asian market. That’s where the market is going to grow much more than China where the population is going to shrink in the next 20 years and will have a mature aging population. India and SE Asia will have a larger and Younger population with growing disposable income, and that’s the market for Nike."
Wow Nike! Just wow! What in the world were you thinking?
Nope I work on broad st 2 blocks from wall
"prophet, fixed it for you:1) Nike has huge contractual Agreements in place with the NFL thru 2028 and most top college FB/BB teams and coaches.(will not help sales)2) Nike + their executives contribute pretty evenly across both party lines and the GOP gladly accepts the donations.(will not help sales)3) Nike is their own manufacturer, distributor, and retailer for most of their products.(will not help sales)4) opinion.5) opinion6) opinion7) opinion8) opinion9) 4th quarter top and bottom line estimates both beat expectation per most top analysts/firms.(one quarter earnings report? LOL)10) opinion"
count me out. Don't get it. They are smart why would they do this? Am I missing the point. Hell JJ Watts rasied 34 million for Houston what about him.
sell the news...had too much of a pre run up
Waiting till after lunch to buy VXX market should be up by about 400 then will fall quickly after.
Smart sellers today.Sell into NIKE buyback before CRASHHHH

Nike not interested in addressing social issue of the SWEAT SHOPS they run where workers manufacture overpriced products and earn pocket change...
"some things can't be forgiven, I will never buy anything from Nike"
Imagine if you paid millions for an ad campaign... and then it was too controversial to air...All you get for it is bad PR
"Antifa buys Nike so they can run from a fight in style - course they buy it with daddy's money, not their own."
"Antifas new gang symbol - the swoosh, just do it!"
"When you least expect it, this stock will drop 15-25%"
"Uh oh, more Red for Nike"
Nike actually should ve collabrated with lil Nas. They lost a lot of respect.
I wanted to see Kaeperdix have to go to work flopping burgers.
markets as red as JacksNewClitty's posterior after unkle pappy getz hold to hit
"When they turned against me with no regard, I left them."
"Is Nike going to be selling a Colon Crapperneck line of pig socks, shoes, and shirts for antifa to wear to their next riot in Portland. Surprised Nike decided to destroy its brand like this. Hope the stock goes to zero."
"comrades!, nike finally sees the light!"
Back to my local sporting goods store again. Nike way overstocked. Adidas and Brooks sold out except odd sizes. Boycott Nike for life!
I bought put options on Nike this am..Because I think people greatly underestimate the republican customers Nike will lose...
"Markets are down today because Owebamma kept his promise to ""fundamentally change America"""
"Sell, Sell, Sell."
Nike and the NFL like investing in Sears no where to go but down
easy short position for you short sellers.
OUCH.....WHAT HAPPENED to NKE? I guess the millennials had to sell their 1 share to buy some more nike products. LOL
I will never OWN anything NIKE. Slobber over this stock all you want to. They earned 67 pennies for the quarter and it held its values. They definitely do not need my money.

"They’re changing their name to, Marxists just be it."
Last earnings for pre-Crapernick news....down hill from here.
Nike pride!
Sacrifice? Really? Go ahead and sacrifice your shareholders...! The country is getting disgusted with publicly traded companies and political narratives.
"UA up 13% premarket, after blowout quarter wants to thank Nike for all it's former customers"
This campaign may be bad for US sales but could boost sales globally.... there’s a whole big world outside of the US believe it or not.
Shorted Nike. Will cover at 60
"A few More knifing's in Europe , Germany will stop buying Nike , A German will not buy from a Muslim controlled company--Germans will march , i will be there with my ""dont buy Nike ' sign----"

"Stock should be 50 bucks, not 100."
Fans are going to be tossing their Nike Sneakers on the field this Sunday..
"Nike makes Colin Kaepernick the face of 'Just Do It' 30th anniversary campaign. It's over Nike, it's over!"
"i will never buy a nike brand ever again.Support someone that kneel on our flag disrespecting not just the flag, but you pretty much lost buissiness of 35 to 45 % of the country , hope it reflects hard and they take a huge miss on the next earnings."
Stooge has been broken.1 of his multiple personalities down and many more to go

I stole the laces off my roommate's Nike running shoes.. hehehehe.
I've never seen so many GIFs used on a yahoo finance conversation board. Does NKE bring out the kiddos?
"New Balance supports manufacturing in the US, has a ready supply of shoes for wider feet, and is opposed to child labor in foreign countries to make their products. NB should be the choice already, and its good that this issue has people looking into it. Just search NB and Nike and look into their political leanings. I did and I won't buy Nike any more. Thank you for waking me up Nike!"

People don't like these overpriced shoes.
Nike is a bubble stock that is going to be deflated from this..
My prediction is the NIKE CEO won't be around by 2019 !
"Wow, if it was a great idea, this stock would be going the other way...."
NKE is buying there own shares back.
Nike stock will never see $100 and in fact has a much better shot at $70 so long as they continue to support China and Kaepernick and what they stand for. My guess is that the stock would pop $10 if Nike had the guts to distance themselves from both. Just my opinion.
Nike has fallen and can't get up

The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day!

"When I was younger I was a varsity athlete at a big ten school, I wonder what would have happened to me if I REFUSED to where the Nike Products they gave me? I would have likely gotten in trouble. Need some brave athletes to show us what happens when you refuse to wear their products?"

"In an effort to be edgy, I think Nike has made a big mistake. I doubt you will see Kap in anymore Nike ads or promotions. Ironically, Nike will bench him by the end of next week when they see the weekly sales numbers roll in. :-)"
"There is so much fake news on Nike right now....""millennials piling into the stock on Robin hood"" ""Nike sales up dramatically (how could they even know that yet?).

"I expected more people to boycott Nike when they first hired Krapernick. I think they took a hit early on and then as time went on people started to forget. I haven't forgotten and never will. I won't buy Nike products and my large soccer club switched from Nike products to NB as well, which I was very happy to see...and I actually like the NB products more anyways.Only way to make your point is to vote with your $. I just wish more people would hold the line and teach this company a lesson."

Nike is now just a SJW brand. Wear Nike and you stand /kneel against law enforcement.
"BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear firm Adidas expects to take a bigger hit from the coronavirus lockdowns in the second quarter, predicting that sales will fall more than 40% after it reported a decline of 19% in the first quarter.Adidas said over 70% of its stores were currently closed worldwide, with a 35% rise in e-commerce in the first quarter only partially offsetting lost sales, which fell to 4.753 billion euros in the quarter, below average analyst forecasts.Its operating profit fell 93% to 65 million euros, also missing analyst forecasts. Adidas said due to the uncertainties around how long its stores would stay closed, it is not able to provide an outlook for the full year."

Hey New Balance makes everything in America and I believe makes their shoes for the military..etc.. I know they had one that was in honor of the US Marines cause I had a pair.
When the shoe burning protests started NKE was around $90. We can see how well that protest went.NKE should make another commercial with Kap.
Hope Nike gets what’s coming for them.Hope the loss billions oh wait they already did hope it keeps dropping.

"My guess is eventually when the full impact of us older Americans that USED to buy Nike shoes is shown, they will get the stock back down to $50's..... I had almost completely only purchased Nike shoes only since in my 20's. I am 58 now. I will not buy Nike ever again until this is changed. I know a LOT of people that feel the same. Time will indeed tell how it goes."
Don’t believe the hype. Long term this stock will be a huge dud. Just look at SBUX for a case study on companies that take a divisive stance.

hope those 1 day of sales to the libs were worth it nike. have fun going down with the krapernick ship!
I can't imagine that this Kaepernick stuff is going to be good for sales.
"The posters here are hilarious. Nike is evil, the P/E is too high, sold Nike and bought tobacco stocks, paying bad wages, and on and on. Meanwhile, one of America's great companies continues to bring it. The institutions that are most responsible for stock valuations continue to buy and push the stock to new all-time highs.

"Don’t agree with the endorsement but here’s an excerpt from a Fortune article about it.“Nike’s current growth is coming from markets that simply don’t care about whether football players take a knee during the U.S. anthem. Nike’s U.S. revenue in the last quarter fell 5% in the last nine months. This was well before it took a side in the kneeling debate. At the same time, it grew 8% in Latin America, 13% in Europe, and 16% in China. Consumers in these companies may know about who kneels in American football, but few will care.”"
Can today be the biggest single day point loss in history?......Weeeeeeee

"The 31% sales increase is misleading. Sure they probably got a slight bump with the publicity, but what they fail to see is 50% of their buyers are now alienating. It's a one off....these other buyers probably didn't need a pair of shoes last week, or might not need one this week, but next time they go into a local sporting goods store, they'll pass Nike by and go with an alternative, same with apparel. What about the colleges that are already cutting ties? It only take a few percent loss of sales to stop Nike's growth trajectory and ding their profits."

"i am going to conservatively (pun intended) assume their US sales will take 20% hit. 40% of their total rev is from US. That's .4*.2 = 8% hit to their total revenue. Profit loss will be more like 10%, meaning stock has to go down much more. Throw multiples contraction on that and we could be looking at 20% drop. Conservatively."

Hey who else is looking forward to the coming civil war? I’d say within the next 20 years for sure. lol.
Not sure why any marketing person would think mixing politics with selling product is a good idea. You are gonna alienate whomever doesn’t agree with your view and they’ll boycott your product. Wouldn’t it make more sense to try and market to the entire population? Guess I’m old school.
I just checked out the the NKE stock. It's covered in 10 foot pole Mark's. What's up with that?
"A Colorado Springs, Colorado, sporting goods store owner has decided to stop carrying Nike gear in his store in response to Nike’s partnership with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.The store, Prime Time Sports, is owned by Stephen Martin who was inspired by the Nike slogan to “just do it,” according to an interview with local KSN News.The store currently has an entire wall, dedicated to Nike gear, and Martin is unsure if his store will be able to stay open without the athletic wear giant’s products.“Pretty sure I won’t survive without them,” Martin said. “I gotta do what I gotta do. I’m just doing it.”"
NKE is down 4.96% to 95.28
"Sketchers are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I had to put a new pair on this morning I had saved. I can't wait for the next reporting for NIKE, you know, the one the CEO uses for his bonuses. That is in 21 days."
I can't see how this stock is a good investment at this time due to COVD-19 and closure of their stores due to social unrest.
FINALLY substantial action is being taken against this barbaric company. But we need to keep up the pressure. Boycott Nike. And let Nike know what you think about them.https://www.foxnews.com/sports/arizona-ducey-nike-plant-incentives-reported-colin-kaepernick-betsy-ross-flag-flap

"It is Americans who once forced ppl to pick up cotton. China doesn't have this ""culture"". Don't know where the rumors come from. They use tractors for collecting cotton."
Liberalism ruins another company. Gheesh! Maybe Nike can double down and find another anti-American face for a commercial. They obviously don’t value the country that helped them get to this level and are backing on global sales. Doubt that will work. I could go to Korea and by a pair for $5.00.
Lots of returned product coming into Nike Retailers..

"Nike is an iconic brand, people will continue to pay up for their Products. Right now, it is clear Adidas is blowing up in the US, but I strongly believe it's just part of a trend. It's also slowing down. The only reason they blew up was because of the hype around their yeezy boost shoes. Nike was still strong during this time though and I think they will come back even stronger. It's important to remember that Nike never left"

The Market has only been falling because the Democoms got the House.Its a little bit of an overreaction since the Republicans dominate everywhere else from President to Senate to number of Governors to State Legislatures.

"What is the attraction for people to this leftist, constantly 'fighting something' ideology anyways? seriously? they want all this culture on one hand, but one the other they want to mix everything into a beige sameness, whilst not having borders, yet wanting to be able to own their own stuff? it's just this hodgepodge, always changing nonsense that none of them practice in their own lives, such as locking their doors and windows. Activating the alarm in their car, etc. Why? Why not just let some stranger use it when they felt like it, or come in your home whenever, and do whatever while in there? That's how the left wants the country run, so why don't they run their own lives like that then? Why do they try to keep people out of their homes, cars, etc, whom they haven't allowed to come in? Why?"

"Nike may not miss earnings this quarter. CFO are good with numbers. But NKE will miss earnings many times over the next 5 years. The people who spent their hard earned dollars on NKE for the kiddos are done. Done. Their families are done. NKE will join GM (the first one), GE (took the bailout money) and many other examples of failed liberal companies that flipped off the millions of consumers that are the backbone of this country (DKS is a little ahead of NKE on the curve here). WMT is on the same basic failing trajectory"

"Never buying Nike again, he was benched before he protested. Should of used Pat Tillman, he sacrificed all!!"
"Nike needs to fire whomever picked Kapernick!John- This just in, this is a decision, made by probably the best marketing division in the world, and reviewed and approved of by virtually every division and executive of Nike, I don't think it would work to fire everyone, LOLGood news though, the marketing division at NIKE is the best in the world so I suspect they might have analyzed this decision and decided it was good for business. I wish there was a good way to short the NFL"

Are Exec's done selling?? Is the buyback over??
Maybe they should make some pig socks to make extra $ and have Colin poster as display.
They have $5b in cash and 1.6b outstanding shares. When it drops to $3.00 they can go private. Maybe that's the plan? That's the only thing that makes any sense.

"Young people also donated to Bernie Sander's campaign even though all of us KNEW that the Democratic Primary was 'rigged' or 'fixed' for Hilary to win which meant any money donated to Bernie was a foolish waste. Same thing now, young people being fooled into believing that Nike here in the USA will just overcome and can win over patriotism and the same thing with the youth giving money to Bernie is going to happen with the youth investing in companies that try to take political sides --- they will in the end lose their money. But you cannot explain to them the tricks in the world and how those tricks will play on their emotions in order to take their money away."

who sounds off on a terrible marketing idea of using a washed up athlete with anti-American views as a spokesman. truly the upper mgmt is asleep at the wheel .... once again at nike.
I smell a shareholder lawsuit coming against the executives. Then a full probe by the SEC to make sure they aren’t cooking the books to hide the forthcoming disaster in earnings.
this is going to be so much fun to follow in the upcoming weeks and months until the net earnings call....thank you god !!!!!

I see more down side at this level then up . Maybe sell now and purchase more when price is lower. Any thoughts"

Investors know nike will take a big hit on their next earnings report. They are getting out!
"is nike still insisting that the crappernick ad campaign over an imaginary cause is a positive to their earnings? the last earnings announcement came out days after the ads started so sales had nothing to do with the ads, just wait until next quarters report, we will see if catering to the millenials that have no disposable income pays off"

Its not just that NIKE should fall.Its that it WILL fall.Its like waiting for a snowflake to melt after Hillary lost.
"If anyone wonders why the contentious debate about NKE just read ths commentary board. It basically is a political attack commentary board swinging right and left with Nike as the football. They politicized their product which alienates some of your client base no matter which side of the political spectrum you are on. Somehow Nike managed to cobble together a winning quarter but I don't buy it and don't think the markets will over the next few days. NKE will start trading down. They are trying to go onine to compensate for overvalued productsa and stock price and to hide the Kaper Wack politicizatioon of tennis shoes. I mean really, thnk about that. Nike sells athletic wear and some brilliant strategist decided to irritate half the nation with Kapernick. Nike will see the fifties before nineties. Tesla fudged nmners to ge one profitable quarter and IMO Nike did similar. Market will start selling this off as they dig deeper into Nike's big comeback. IMO Now have fun with this post. When Nike volume starts slacking I will buy puts."

"It's crazy how well positioned Nike is for future/sustainable growth. Continue to balance the cool/hip factor while still being accessible for older buyers. Long-term bullish for sure as they continue to pump the consumer pipeline. Also, from a competitive set, both UAA and Adi seem to be stuck in neutral to reverse and Puma isn't at their level, so nobody close to being able to challenge Nike at the top."

"This is only the beginning of the run down word. Of course Nike will not go bankrupt. The stock harbor will continue to drop because they have a very bad reputation especially in America which accounts for around 70% of all their business. Nobody that I know he’s willing to buy their products anymore due to the anti-American stance which I said before accounts for 70% of their overall business. Bad decisions lead to bad outcomes, if you’re long you need to get their management to snap out of their anti-American PUBLIC stance."

"Where are all the articles about the $5 billion dollar man. Two weeks after the announcement I say at least five articles saying he was responsible for the increase (even thought the market was on a tear at that point). Come on journalist, do a follow up piece and give credit where credit is due."
All companies have litigation reserves and NKE will quietly settle with Zion for $5-10 mil max. Won’t hurt it’s bottom line. End of story.
Never liked Nike that much. There were better shoes available thatwere less expensive.Adidas has Naomi OsakaNike has Colin Kaepernut and Serena Williams.Nike is making Adidas very happy lately.
America loves Adidas and New Balance.
SO TRUMP DIDN'T HONOR THE VETERANS BOO HOO MAYBE NIKE WILL GIVE HIM A 100 MILLION CONTRACT LIKE KRAPERNICK
Love watching this drop day by day. Sorry longs.
$130.00We will close
"With their plunge into social issues in this country, Nike is fast becoming a cultural thermometer for the 20 somethings, in my opinion. It doesn't play well with flyover country or older groups, but the money and the people are on the coasts. And there is nothing smarter then to continue to fuel the consumer pipeline with the next generation of decision makers and purchasers."
Nike propped their stock up for a short period but they can’t continue doing it for long. If you want to make a ton of money short Nike 1000 shares. With all of this negative publicity IT WILL TANK
topped out...... short sellers take over now!

How was NKE only down 1.05% after the Zion catastrophe??? Soros and Steyr must have bought a gazillion shares to prop the thing up.
"Nike just put the NFL in checkmate! The NFL owners are simply checkbooks. They aren't running their own businesses. The players' union and sponsors like Nike OWN the NFL!!! Unfortunately, they don't care about Americans, and they certainly don't care about our veterans and pride in our country. They only care about their own political agenda. I sincerely hope Americans vote with their wallets. Don't buy Nike products. Not just today or tomorrow, but NEVER! This is bigger than a simple ad campaign. This is how Nike feels about America, and they just poked their finger in the eye of this country's proud men and women!"

Right back to where it was. What did I tell you?
Some intern at Nike came up with this idea and the millionaire CEOs who are out of touch with reality were like “my daughter who takes women studies at college would love this idea”. Like the guy at EA games said they put in female soldiers for their WW2 game because his 13 year old daughter plays Fortnite and wanted to play as a girl lmao

I bought a pair online from UA (first pair ever of UA shoes) and they had very few sizes available. Don't know if that is a demand thing but was definitely true for a couple models

Ann Coulter gets it there’ll be no Trump WALL. And she wrote 2 Dear Leader books on Trump!

This is the short of a lifetime. Thank you Kaepernick. I can't believe this thing is still in the 80's. Can't wait until their 4th quarter earnings report!

Lots of companies in development and clinical stage don’t make any money are trading higher. Nike makes money and you shorts/ haters saying that it’s overpriced? I hope $140 for tomorrow.
"I believe it will take months to see the true affect of this add and making Kap the face of your product. There may have been a brief uptick in sales due to people wanting to show their support, but will it be sustained? lets talk again in Feb."
Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired on the spot
I hope this goes to zero
No company can afford to ignor China as a consumer market. Don't under estimate the impact to the bottom line for the next few quarters.
Whats the matter NIke? Catering to BLM isn't a good business model? Shocking !!
MAGA-cultist RichTard is a proud lifetime memberhttp://www.logcabin.org
Wearing Nike is now like wearing DEMOCRAT PARTY symbol.
is that $4b gone?
Tic Toc Tic Toc The NIKE Snowflake meltdown watch has begun
Sold all my KO and bought Nike for the first time.. looks like I have some muting to do on this board.
Will never buy another Nike product!
I say it will be 102 tomorrow for sure. earning is pretty good. Also china deal is about to come soon.

Maybe Nike will hit $49 soon. Then they will have another thing in common with Colin Kapernick ex-San Francisco 49ers. Betsy Davos says just sell it.

Where is Kap? It's like he's vanished along with Nike's future dividend distributions
STORMY LOOKS BENT OVER AND RODE HARD
just lose it!
swoosh! bye bye NIKE
You get caught in the a good rain ONCE and nikes are historywhat do they use for gluewheatpaste?
i have seen 2 commercials when introduced and have not seen one since. WHY
Not sure if everyone knows this but Nike and Adidas app had been removed from China.
"Look at a one month chart for Nike, not pretty...."
"Anytime you see Nike green, short it. You can't lose."
NIKE are the ones buying this Bubble Disaster Stock! Using up all their cash with business going down the tubes!
Trump support 36% try again.
"This stock is way overvalued. But no one cares about financials or fundamentals. The market is now all about headlines. Nike digital sales increases. Wow. How did that happen. Is that because of the brand or the company ? Get real. It is a pandemic factor and ALL DIGITAL activity and sales were up. It is not because of anything Nike did. Actual sales were down year over year. But you will not see that in any headline. The headlines control the market, so the headlines must always be positive. So we ignore REAL sales and only use headlines that are bullish for stocks. NKE stock should be under 100 a share. But it has been pumped and pushed by positive and often misleading headlines. With the closing of stores digital sales should have been up over 200% to show any real growth. But digital sales did not even make 100%. But they make you think the 82% number is fantastic and it just is not. NKE is way overvalued for a company that sells poor quality goods manufactured in China. You have been manipulated, mislead, and fooled. swoosh"
"Thank you Colin, keep that division going."
Veterans buy Adidas
just wait until next quarter when the fall out will be felt in earnings. i think nke is lying a about this add campaign working.
"Blue Puddle have you visited Amazon Go? You know the grocery store with zero employees, no checkout lines?It's amazing! The more you push for a higher minimum wage the more corporations will automate"

Did anyone see the heavyset girl running after that tennis ball Saturday I’d be angry too
Opening down again!
Deadcat Bounce is only good if you take profit before it falls again.71.50 is Coming!!
Wait till next qtr when Republicans boycott it
"Earnings are Sept 25, but that won't be the quarter that will be affected by the political view being shared by the company instead of trying to increase shareholder value. The December quarter will be the one to watch. And Christmas will be about the time they report so christmas sales will be one to watch. I always bought either UA or NKE stuff for my two grandchildren, but from now on, it won't be Nike and I am sure there will be tons of others just like me."
low tax return = less products bought
Hope and change lol
NIKE UP .06 AH FREDDY THAT IS STRONG LMAO
Glad kap effect still going strong. With all shopping malls closed worldwide sales are going to zero!
Make America Great Again!
"Nike just crushed NFL's opening night ratings with a horrible 13.4 rating. Will the NFL renegotiate contracts with their ""partner""?"
Just say no to nike......
Kaepernik Hahahahaha
Nike does not deserve to have any rendition of the American Flag on any of it's shoes.
I won't even buy Nike at Marshall's or TJ Maxx.
"Gary...they are ""boycotting"" the NFL but tune into every game waiting to see a commercial helping ratings lol. Who are they kidding? This past Thursdays' Cowboys' Saints' game was the highest rated Thursday night football game of all time. Who's suffering from this boycott? Nike will crush earnings and this same group will say wait for next quarter's earnings. Just wait, it's coming lol. Then you have guys saying they are shorting today. Nike will close green today but they will claim they made money lol. Be great at something besides itching and moaning your way through a losing cause."
This is going to follow the same pattern as ADBE Adobe stock after earnings. Don't bank on recovery at least for a month
#NKEisaT/u/rd
"Does anyone see a pattern with this company. All you can do is not financially support the politics of this progressive pandering company. They seem to do fine after controversy, but as a former retired corporate guy I am surprised by their constant entry into the dark side. Companies on entities designed to one thing, to generate a product, sell that product, be better than anyone else making a comparable product, in order to create profits for the stockholders. Its pretty simple. Why would a company become so socially progressive that they alienate a big portion of a potential market. I would not think this to be in the best interest of the stockholders. Companies should be neutral on social issues. I also do not understand why Kaepernick, if he truly is their public face, does not review products before they hit the market, to make sure it is in line with his perspective. Personally the Betsy Ross Flag, represents a time as early at 1777, long before NIke or Kaepernick, and had the circle of 13 stars as I understand to represent the original 13 colonies bound together by the unity of a circle. I do not think Betsy or anyone else thought it was racist or discriminatory. Oddly enough if Nike wants to get on the topic of slavery, they should look in their own yard. They have their product made for pennies in slave like conditions in foreign countries. I really do not buy their sense of righteous indignation to be legitimate."
does not look like it will stay green..... REDS ALWAYS BEST WITH THIS JUST LIKE VOTING
"I""m running from this one..."
I can’t get enough of this Trump completely owns the media. We are so blessed to have such an amazing President!
prophet what do you sell
Rally on blue wave FAIL is possible plus tax cuts and other things that will get jammed thru by the end of the year makes sense plus talks with china in a few weeks but at the same time I could see a big drop first this week and then rally
LSU DURING AWAY WITH NIKE
Now do you understand why I sold out at $145?It's over.
5 in my family NO MORE NIKE...BOYCOTT..
Great story to invest in. If your going to short it!
Thanks Nike. For reminding me not to watch the NFL.
"Jin, Nike going down bro."
down $7 Billion in market Kap....bwahaha
The shoes should have a weight limit. I’m not sure a pair of combat boots would hold up with as big and strong as this guy is. A lot of advertising for NIKE for free. How much better does it get.
The stock will drop below $80 after earnings. This history proves after each earning the stock drops.
"With the Kraepernik resistance and 25% tariff coming, should drop into the 50’s."
"So Mark Parker steps down as CEO. Something tells me there is more going on that what we see on the surface. I think the next few days will tell a lot, but I would be cautious of an abrupt CEO step down."
This Veteran is done with Nike.
Great opportunity to short nike.
LOL!! https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-election-apos-traumatic-202033446.html
Why did Nike go against it's customers like it did?
Disaster. We open below $100.
My NIKE days are OVER.. Just DON'T IT
Sell all my NKE stock today
This earning report was excellent! Buy any dip...if there is one
ADIDAS! My new Harden's are awesome!
Dows up 151 pts while Nike is down today. Interesting to say the least.
"China is the next superpower and a bilion dollar marketplace, sell and save your money"
SELLLL!!!!
Should I buy the dip NKE good stock right?
Long term good but short term bearish. Popped too high. Should pull back to $120 first & fill in.
THAT'S RIGHT JOHNNY BUT LEFT WING MEDIA WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
Another Jane Fonda moment to remember. If Nikes were sold when she'd have worn them when she posed for that photo sitting in that Communist Vietnamese anti aircraft gun. make no mistake this betrays our soldiers in the same way.
"This earnings report has the same feeling the tesla earnings report gave when magically they announced profitability for the dirst time by pushing all and any recenue into that quarter to acheive profitability in order to secure financing. Nke has the same feel withh this report. If they give guidance stock craters but .... imo... stock trades down after euphoria dissipates. Hangmen didn't bring a rope kind of euphoria. Nke still has to justify a bloated valuation in a slowing market. On line sales aaved their bacon, this time. Going forward, nope. Market takes nike sown after releif rally. Maybe as soon as marker close tomorrow. Opens green , closes red. Reebok and adidas in this house. No nike knee pqds. Nike, trades down, overvalued, after hours just bag holders for shorts."
4TH QUARTER EARNINGS WILL SINK THIS....Anti American company !!! I`m gonna laugh at the bag holders when it does.

I wont be buying any Nike for myself or anyone in my family. I am also not going to support players that are sponsored by Nike.
Is Alabama and the rest of patriotic college football going to leave Nike on their jerseys? Gonna be backlash if they do.
NKE crosses 83.Thanks KAP!!!
"It's not much, but I'm selling all of my Nike stock tomorrow... Getting out while its still worth something..."
"thank you for the crappernick ads, how much has it dropped? and by the way this drop is nothing compared to when they report their quarterly earnings in a couple of months"
"How is that Kraepernik thing working out, pinko's??"
"a buddy of mine is a cop, he said he’s now going to give the nastiest most expensive and damaging tickets to people wearing new Nike anything lol. He’s calling it a ‘leftist tax’. haha."

Wow 100 million dollars to blm and looters nice job Nike will not by any Nike products
NKE must go to 71.12!! I hope it holds so I can start shorting on it again next week
"Two players kneeled today in total, Kaep's movement is dead. Literally no one supports it! The media expected some ""triumphant"" moment where everyone would take a knee today and it didn't happen. Nike just made a huge mistake. Serves them right."
Demrats continue to cross red lines.....refuse to recuse....and collude....demrats always colludin'
"Free speech is a totally different issue. Once at the stadium (or any team event for that matter) players are at work. And at work a whole different set of rules apply.Personally, I hope Nike goes down the same road as Kaepernick."
NKE matters! $300 stock inside 2 years.

This stock is toast after earnings :))
"nke down 10% since ""the ad""...."
Bought sneakers on Saturday. For years I bought Nike sneakers and socks. Saturday I bought New Balance. I refuse to buy Nike from now on. The stock will take a hit as millions will not buy sneakers from Nike. It will be seen in months and years to come as normal people do not buy sneakers unless they need them.
Helloooo $70's
Just got off the phone with Yung Joc.. He said NKE is goin down for real !!
"What company would go out of their way to have 20 million(perhaps low) potential customers hate them? Not be indifferent, but hate them. The other odd thing is why doesn't the product matter? I realize marketing is important but in the end the product should be what drives sales, not some temporary marketing gimmick. This was quite a leap and I just can't figure out how it makes any sense."
That gap is bound to fill
This stock just keeps going up.
ahh...Im falling!!!!
Any and all police officers out there should be ditching thier nikes. Thier families nike shoes also.
Time to short this mess.
I can’t wait for Christmas sales results. Nike will trade under $50

Still down on 2X's normal volume and we have 2.5 hours left. There is a conclusion to draw on that information.

"the communist LEFT, has it all figured out. We need socialism so we can't compete with China economically. We need to elect only minority candidates or women just because they are minorities or women. We need to be like the Scandinavian islands where corporations pay 16% income tax and citizens pay 50%. We need to produce MORE OIL like the Scandinavian islands so we can have free education and health Care.did I miss anything?"
"I am a living breathing 100% example of a lifelong Nike person until yesterday. I will never again, that means ""NEVER AGAIN"", buy or wear anything that Nike owns, not a single thing, ever. I want this company gone, out of business in the next 5 years, and as of yesterday, so do 10's of millions of other people. Lesson 'em good!"
"I now AVOID NIKE products. I'm not alone it appears, judging by price action of stock.PS: The market that NIKE's newest adds are targeting (about 15% of population/demographic) was already saturated BEFORE add was run. The other 85% will either not notice/care or, like me, are offended and will no longer purchase NIKE products."
Nike upgraded to 97 MS.
walked around in Malls yesterday..... asked employees how Nike Sales was doing and every one said it's their weakest line....... ADIDAS and Champion including Underarmour is performing Nike and all said its been that way for some months. Nike pulled the stunt to get their name out there.... let's see how well it works in 6 months.
SOMETHING IS HAPPENIN' HERE....WHAT IT IS ...IS PERFECTLY CLEAR....NKE AND KARAP GOIN' DOWN DOWN DOWN!
"sorry nike fans, but I've never liked nike shoes, and I went into a nike store recently and thought it was a joke. I was looking for a pair of shoes and saw everything but. The chart pattern also looks like a disaster about to happen."
NKE is a company based in the Socialist Republic of Oregon Run by Socialist. Whatdo you expect ?
"I think Nike has found themselves on the right side of history. It's is soaring like an eagle. BLM is good for America. It personifies what our creed stands for, equality for all not just some who look a certain way."
Where is the commercial?
It's always a great day when you look at the market and see UAA up and Nike continue to fall deeper under that $80.00 a share mark you liberals all bought in at.
DOWNGRADED...!!! Wait until after the Holidays!!!
"Nike Is suing the makers if the blood satan shoe when word gets out that Nike did not approve the shoe, and is suing the people that made it. This is gonna bounce."

Do not buy Nike or anything of the players that kneel during Anthem Money talks
I can see NFL games getting turned off in a lot of sports bars if they run Kaep's commercial. I heard many Veteran's clubs won't even air the games anymore. I can see a lot of bars turning off games if they run Kaepernick ads if enough people complain. That will end this fiasco sooner than anything else.

"The National Association of Police Organizations is calling for a boycott of sportswear giant Nike, incensed by its latest “Just Do It” ad campaign featuring former NFL player and police protester Colin Kaepernick.The police group sent a letter to Nike Chairman and CEO Mark Parker saying that the choice of Kaepernick as their public face is an “insult” to police officers everywhere.“In featuring Mr. Kaepernick in the ‘Just Do It’ campaign, Nike grossly insults the men and women who really do make sacrifices for the sake of our nation,” the letter reads according to TMZ Sports.AMERICANS WILL STAND FOR THE FLAG AND STAND WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS !“We are calling on all our member officers, their families, and friends to join in boycotting all Nike products.”"

"Do you think Raheem had on Nikes when he ran?Trooper Kevin Conner was fatally shot around 12:15 a.m. ET Wednesday in Columbus County when he stopped a pickup truck — driven by 20-year-old Raheem Cole Dashanell Davis — for speeding, according to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol."
Did they say something in CC? Shares are dropping like a rock LOL
"The Kiss of Death, it will be extremely hard for Nike to overcome this failure in judgement."
Under armor I will be buying. I’m done with Nike.
Did you see the heavyset girl chasing that tennis ball yesterday. ? She had to know she didn’t stand a chance
"Not only am I a long term Nike stock holder, but also a loyal customer. Why buy anything else when the best in the business is an American company with world wide brand loyalty and recognition?"
"Socialist FRANCE is in complete disarray. 80% of all citizens want less taxation Many citizen's are on the brink of starvation. Yet another Socialist country collapsing and the liberals here in America want more socialism!!France has the #1 health Care system in the world. It's ""free"". Why is the rest of the country in complete chaos? please educate me Liberals....."
NKE is the most UNDERVALUED stock on Wall St!
I will buy NIKE at 30
"US Football is in trouble with or without Kap or Protests. Mothers are increasingly not allowing their children to play. Youth football programs are folding up. Many high schools are canceling their programs. The sport is just too dangerous. Soccer and Baseball, both international sports, will take football’s place. There is no “long term” for football......unless it becomes flag football."
PE of 68? Not for long!
hahahahha China is boycotting Nike because of their comments about how china is treating its citizenry... but Nike declined Reboks invitation to cohaberatively end their use of Taiwanese sweat shops. Oh the Irony. Burn in #E11 nike
"My local discount/closeout/overstock shoe store Shoe Dept has now a huge supply of Nike shoes. There is usually a normal stocking but now it seems to dwarf all other brands. I don't know if this is because Nike shoes are not selling in the normal channels but this is abnormal. In fact, I could only find one pair of shoes my size of another brand which makes it difficult for me since I won't buy Nike products."
Mr T was right....Pain!!!
"haha down again? another red day nike? good on you, do sell more red shoes!"
Wait until SEC (South Eastern Conference) schools and southern high schools start dumping Nike contracts. Adidas and Under Armor are ready to scoop them up. #GetWokeGoBroke
Down goes Nike tomorrow morning.
why is all NIKE merchandise being merchandise behind Adidas..... merchants always put their best selling forward. GO LOOK
Prophet make more ageism attacks. I'm begging you
Nike is all about democracy and free speech ... until it costs them money.They need to support Hong Kong and denounce China!
Anyone else notice the Stock Market was setting new highs all the way into October and then people sensed the Dem/Comms might take the House and it started Tanking?
Is there any one else that feels NKE is being held up artificially ??
"Okay then he should have taken Denver's offer, being statistically superior to half of the NAPs BACK-UPS, again BACK-UPS does not make him a good NFL QB. Should have taken Denver's offer, like I said probably would have landed the back up job there. Easy Peasy..."
North America revenues fall short of estimates' The Craperdic effect!
Hard for me to imagine anyone investing in a company that thinks its smart to alienate half or more of its customer base.
buy snowflakes buy..... LOL
Millennials taking the bait LOL
"just bought my nike-che guevara, shoes, the one with che's picture on i! ROCK ON COMRADES! VIVA LA REVOLUTION!!"
"Absolutely splendid gain for Nike today! This company continues to outperform the DOW and other stocks. In fact, my associates at The Institute claim that NKE has swelled our endowment fund to phenomenal proportions!"
$138 for close today?
"Don't worry, longs, the company will make it up with more revenue from knee-pads. Hopefully Antifa will also officially endorse Nike."
No Nike!
"Adidas Reebok and Under Armor should be paying Colin Krappernick, not Nike. Krapper is responsible for surging sales at all of Nike's competitors. If I were Under Armor, I'd secretly slip Krappernick a few mil to keep destroying Nike."
NUN REMEMBER WE ALL KNOW HOW LITTLE LEMON GOT HIS JOB HINT: WASN'T HIS GOOD LOOKS ARE JOURNALISM SKILLS
revenue 11. 97 bn eps will be 0.90 Usd mark my words 
"Think about it from a shareholder perspective. The people, the many, many people, on the anti-Kapernick/kneeling side of the issue are quite passionate about their point of view. Why in gods name would you purposely stick your finger in the eye of that many people. You will never, ever pick up the lost sales. People in China, rest of Asia and Europe don't give two craps about Kapernick or this issue, so you're not getting it there. Over the medium term it's got to be a big negative in the US. One of the most mind-boggling things I have ever seen."
Wow 25pe with a skinny dividend in a weak consumer spending economy... lol yea let’s rally this up so I can short again
"This awful move does not make sense to me. I guess my $ is not desired by Nike anymore. Will not buy Nike again and my view of the brand and company is extremely negative - visceral reaction, down deep. All Goodwill I had toward this brand is all gone."
I THINK MARES STOOGE AND PROPHET HAVE CAPITULATED JUST LIKE NIKE SHAREHOLDERSROFLMAO
feel sorry for those who had this one as their top holdings in a mutual fund. OUCH!
"NKE was growing. I can say I have only seen 1 or 2 of the ads, not much for the big play they said it was going to be. NKE mgt just doesn't want to admit this was a big mistake and alienated 25-50% of their US customers. Next few qtrs will tell."
Nike!
Indeed I do believe in something. I was going to their outlet store today and will not go. Thank you Nike for reminding me to believe in something. I believe I will not purchase any of your products. Under Armour will now get out families business.
Zee won’t comment here today because NKE is down. Again! Pump and dump
How are those politics selling sneakers? 12B buy back to stay even?
"They know their customer ""base"".https://qz.com/554784/1200-people-are-killed-each-year-over-sneakers/"
Illegals are causing so many problems for mexico!
"Nike so un American, God bless America"
At least they make it easy for me to sell since they are in all time high. Side with a race baiting racist anti American and I don’t think I’ll buy your products any longer. Hence I need to sell my stock.
"Nike closes running camp tied to scandalNike (NYSE:NKE) CEO Mark Parker says the company is shutting down its Nike Oregon Project training group following the four-year ban of Alberto Salazar by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency .""This situation, along with ongoing unsubstantiated assertions, is a distraction for many of the athletes and is compromising their ability to focus on their training and competition needs. I have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project,"" states Parker in a memo sent to Runner's World.The Nike Oregon Project was a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes with decorated marathon runner Salazar serving as the head coach."
"Nike, what a way to support our country, or flag and our freedom. ""Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything"". Ummm, this is exactly what our soldiers do everyday and this is also what our flag stands for. You will sacrifice nothing, as money and fame still rolling in and teach younger people to disrespect our country and flag."
NKE even climbs after hours. This stock is gong to $500 one day! And sooner than you think!
I would liked to have been in that boardroom when that Idea was pitched so I could have fired the presenter...wow. Must have been Friday when half the people had already left. NIKE ..not good idea.
Put a buy in...at 50.
There are better shoes and better stocks
Just buy adidas
"OK, Adidas. It’s time to run the most patriotic advertising campaign you can think of!"
Why did NIKE just hire Kaperhick to be their CEO
"Bravo, Nike, bravo indeed! It appears to my associates at The Institute that all the NKE shorts on this message board are now living in a beat-up van down by the river. That's sad, but it's good for our Endowment Fund which has benefited tremendously from Nike!"
NKE PAID OBOMBA FOR A COMMERCIAL BUT COULD NOT USE IT....OBOMBA ONLY TALKED ABOUT HIMSELF
SHORTS CONTINUE TO LOSE ON NKE. Slow and steady higher.
"Good timing on their new commercials, I was about to buy a couple pair of tennis shoes and now I have one less brand to consider..."
"Kaerpernick is a joke. He looks like an extra from Spike Lee's latest movie. Kaerpernick is no hero. This is a publicity stunt by NIKE, and I hope it backfires on them."
do we really need to be lectured by a company who used to exploit child labor and still exploits cheap labor in developing nations?
message to NKE -- don't SHEYT where you sleep .
Will this open the door for Purina to hire Michael Vick to promote it's dog chow?
on a valuation basis it seems a little rich right now
NIKE DIDN'T raise guidance because they know Kraepernik is going to hurt profits but they DON'T CARE
ghetto nike supporters are not buying those nfl tickets that for sure. btw...viewership is DOWN! attendance is almost the same!
Nice run. Timberrrrrrrrrrrr
"Not a smart move, what were they thinking?"
"Cancel Nike and the Chinese Communist Party.Oh, wait, they're the same thing."
WHERE IS THE KRAPERNICK ADDIS NIKE BOYCOTTING KRAPERNICK NOW?
It's like having a Crystal ball .... You know sales will be down now .... Why hold ?
Nike is going to need a GoFundMe page. #ustoo
"What happened to ""this is the short of the year?"""
came to this board to say one thing. I will never wear anything Nike ever again.
Last quarter nike beat estimate by .05 then alienate their customers. You do the math
"The Wall Street ""experts"" are claiming that this won't hurt Nike and will even help it. They don't get it. NKE shares likely to fall below $50 within 2 years."
$NKE Target Raised by Piper Sandler Overweight USD 168 » USD 170
Great short here...so over bought and the upgraded with target of $98 leaves virtually NO upside......BUY PUTS!!!!!!!!!
In respect to pat Tillman everyone should not watch Thursday night football . Nike is featuring the Kaepernick add.
"Modern marketers believe controversy is a powerful motivator to tap into. However, this is a tricky thing and can backfire."
Time to switch to Adidas. And fast.
How can anyone seriously be excited about an up day when the last big up day was all given right back? Still down 4000 from the highs.
"The new ""Colon Kapernut"" shoes? They may have some support, but they have no sole. Thank you LexTrader"
why don't you Nike investors care about the working conditions (sweat shop) that make these products?
Had to return my recently purchased Nike Running Shoes. Not enough sole support. New Balance is the only athletic shoe 100% manufactured in the United States. Look it up. They will also give $10 off in their New Balance stores if you're military. (Have to ask)
It was Hugely Overpriced then the PROS bought it higher on the Kapernick news now it must fall more...
under $70 by Friday.... enjoy SHORTS
Nike - great shoes if you're just gonna take a knee and not seriously going to play the game.
NKE decided to support the 40% of Democrats must have received their marketing efforts from Fake news
Oh I’m so shorting this tomorrow 
Can anybody explain what this stock is doing trading at 6x sales?Over past 14 years it never traded over 3.5x....Price to book and Price to Earnings also way above avg
"North America sales down from last year, but stock all time high."
$142 tomorrow?????
Been holding Nike for a while... Do yall think I should get out and just soak the loss? Do we see any real positives coming in the future?
Another down day coming
"JUST CHECKED OUT THE SITE JOHNNY, SEE LEBRON, SERENA , OTHERS I DON'T KNOW NO KRAPERNICK ON THEIR SITE DON'T THEY WANT TO STAND UP FOR JUSTICE WITH KRAPERNICK YOU WOULD THINK THE NEW FACE OF NIKE WOULD BE PLASTERED ALL OVER THE SITE HIS PICTURE IS NO WHERE ON THE SITE WHAT MESSAGE IS NIKE SENDING TO US"
Over 105 next week
80.4279.4278.4277.42What happened to 79.50 Prophet ?? You said it would hold!!
IF YOU VOTE BLUE YOUR VOTING FOR NANCY PELOSIEVEN HER OWN PARTY WANTS HER GONE JUST TURN ON CNN FOR 5 MINUTES IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME RED WAVE WILL COVER THE US
Where have all the articles gone about the $3 billion dollar man? If Krapernick made the stock go up I guess he is not responsible for the fall? For the record it went up when the market was UP six days in a row but somehow he got all the press and accolades for it.
New Balance has always worked for me. Will continue to do so.
it was more of a RED WAVE then a Blue wave......
Just BROKE the post Kraeperbik LOW!! The KAEPERNIK CRASHHHH Continues!!
"It will take a few weeks or months till sales drop to fully effect Nike's stock, let's hope Nike is destroyed"
"I don’t understand this from Nike perspective. Your company is doing great and near all-time highs. You have stayed away from major news or controversy. Why take a heavy stance with such a controversial figure in Colin now? You could have pushed this ad with numerous star athletes and it wouldn’t have been such a political debate. I just don’t understand what they hope to gain from this that made them believe it was a great idea. I’ve seen weirder situations in stock price movements but I would be very surprised if this doesn’t drop a few percentage points tomorrow. Trump will likely have something to say and try to target Nike just because he can. Why, Nike? Why."
i shorted 1000 shares first thing this morning
Buy Colgate. At least you'll get a dividend.
It would be interesting to see what Trump supporters wear at Rallies...……..Would make a good commercial for a competitor
Kneel and the stock God may forgive this stock??? NOT!!!
"If you buy Nike at this point, you'll get what's coming to you. Nike was already overvalued at $66 months ago in May. Now the brand is synonymous with hatred of America. If you want to invest in that, I urge you to do so."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
It BROKE UNDER 75 already!! LOL!!
assuming you bought this at $78..... how much profit will you lose as this continues its decline..... BECAUSE IT IS GOING MUCH FURTHER DOWN!
Get out before it crashes to $60. Just saying...
I just don’t think companies should have opinions. You will always disfranchise a large segment of your customers.
Lost me as a customer.
Perhaps Williams feels empowered by Colon ?
"KEEP ON SHORTING,$55.00"
HOW MANY DUMOCRAT BAG HOLDERS WILL SAY THEY SHORTED TODAY AT 85.10 ROFLMAO
What genius came up with this idea ? No more NIKE for me.
CLIFF DIVE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE MORE LIKE NIKE TOOK A KRAPERNICK
your only power is just to support something or not I personally did not watch the game I have a 17 hour day ahead of me today some of these players make more in 1 game than I do in 50 years of work. Iam out no balance everyone enjoy what you want but to me. Iam over sports and politics.
"all pc news outlets say this is good, but stockholders say no way!!!"
"As the spouse of a veteran, I’m saddened by Nike’s decision to support Colin. Our family will no longer be buying your products."
"google says nike is 176 billion market cap yahoo finance says 215 billion, which is it ????"
Watch for falling knives - like NKE stock
Perhaps the Foot Locker success was just timing with most of the quarter before the Kapernick decision but if it truly is that the US citizens just don't respect the country anymore then that is just a sad statement of where we are.
Another bad decision by Nike?.
Down goes NIKE UP GOES AMERICA
Another one for NIkehttps://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/former-cowboys-rb-joseph-randle-arrested-charged-with-rape/ar-BBN0ihG?li=BBnb7Kz&ocid=mailsignout
Well guess this board won't be talking about Nike stock today.
Enough is truly enough this time. Nike must now be taught a genuine lesson. A gigantic PR campaign against the company must be mounted. It must be driven into the ground. https://www.theblaze.com/news/2019/12/19/nike-to-release-kaepernick-shoe-marking-the-day-he-began-protesting/amp
I will not watch the game tonight because I will not support Nike or the NFL..The rest of the advertisers are being hurt by both Nike and the NFL...They shouldnt have to pay for their time tonight because the audience will be thinner than promised
Get out! Up graded BS!
Where is Zee the ? Must be cuddling with BA .
So if we cut the cord literally at the border that’s 2.4 billion a year we save Put that on the list I’ll vote for that
Nike is done. sell!!!!!!https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2019/03/27/michael-avenatti-shares-documents-allegedly-showing-nike-payments/3295508002/
"Economic optimism, worldwide, began rising as soon as King Hussein moved out of our White House. Investors, worldwide, were glad to see him leave."
Boycott is working thanks to American patriots fed up with leftist posturing
"Nike Believes this will help them in the long term.....They are very WRONG! My children,grandchildren and great grand children will never buy Nike again. We love our country!"
"Adidas has made a phenomenal comeback even before Nike trashed their own company.They will get my money and support going forward.I will do my part to assist Nike on the downside, Put options and shorts should help drag the company to its knees... so to speak."
It’s time for Nike to fly
UT OH LOOKS LIKE BAG HOLDERS FELL FOR THE UPGRADE ROFLMAO
POTUS can tank nike with a word
"5000 years China lost no WARS---1,400,000,000 people , the government is in 100% control , loose the growth market is doom --dont be a bag holder ???? dead money--"
There are a lot of other shoes made my NKE's competitors. No more NKE.
Michael Jordan is walking away from Nike... that's going to hurt the company for sure.
IS THAT A MAGA HAT ARE IS HILARY BURNING THE EVIDENCE AGAIN
Don’t buy Nike products!!
"I can't wait until they miss earning again. At 30x year end earnings which is outrageously expensive, this stock is going to go down."
Did they share guidance? The effects of covid19 will be felt in the next earnings. No this one.
I will never buy Nike for me or any of my three kids. Very sad because I like Nike.
"As I said, ride this B until the wheels fall off. A brotha has got to Pea Eye Mmm Pea."
"After attacking H&M and pulling its products off shelves, Chinese government and people are coming around and attacking Nike now because Nike announced similar ban on using Xinjiang cotton. H&M has only 5.7% sale from China while Nike has over whopping 46%. Things are getting much worse day by day."
Did you take your profit ?
Never bring politics into your business because when you do you immediately remove half your customers and in this case that half has most of the money.
lol...Nike getting ready to crash. I know I'm not the only one to notice the h&s forming the right shoulder.
"Someone with the screen name of ""Charlie"" continually mocks those of us who are opposed to Kaepernick's posturing and Nike using him as a brand ambassador. Charlie derides us for our putatively overblown patriotism.Patriotism my kiester. How 'bout Kaepernick simply not despise the nation that has given him so much -- so much freedom, so much opportunity, so much fame, so much glory, and so much money?"
I iwill Just Do It. I will just stop buying Nike Products.
"According to analysts at Bank of America Global Research brands like Brooks, HOKA One One, On Running, and Nike’s (NKE) performance running sneakers stand to benefit from a resurgence in interest in running outdoors.BofA’s analysis shows that Google search trends for Brooks — which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) —are up 83%, while searches for HOKA, owned by the Deckers Outdoor (DECK), are up 65%, and Swiss startup On Running (which counts Roger Federer as an investor) has seen searches rise 28%.The firm also notes that searches for Nike Running are outpacing this entire group, rising 104% through May 24.“We believe key beneficiaries from the relative momentum in performance running are [Nike] & [Deckers Outdoor],” BofA wrote in a note to clients published Monday."
"Nike already has my money so it doesn't make sense for me to burn my shoes. I do promise this, moving forward, I'll never buy Nike again."

NKE short setting up nicely
Just took a quick inventory of what we have. Over $1000 worth of Nike shoes and clothing. $0 going forward.
I'm done with NIKE.
Down 5 tomorrow we’re just getting started
"Volume, at this point, looking lower than yesterday. I can't imagine longs can sustain as volume continues to evaporate in the uncertainty of NKE... and, I believe, the next time we here a report about current sales.. it will most likely reflect negatively."
"The fantastic gains in Nike seem to happen every trading day, but my associates at The Institute and I never get tired of them. Our Nike gains have swelled our endowment fund to mammoth proportions. Long live Nike, the King of Athletic Shoes!"
Antifa can use their welfare money to buy their goods.
Down the Krapper!! Somebody going bye bye in advertising!!
"inventory is up 31% margins are down sharply. We will all be, ""witnesses"" to the fall of Nike"
Hey Blue Oyster Lgbt queen what will you call yourself when we win again. ? What will you say ?
Thank you for the cheap shares. Brought my CDA up by $3 but I'm betting NKE will be $188 by 3Q. Come on Colin! Play your magic ghtto flute!
China removes Nike on many sites there still burning sneakers strong sell
"krapernick is good for a 16% decrease in stock price. Nice work Nike!! Here is a new slogan for you: Some times stating your politics as a publicly traded company, means sacrificing all your capital."
"On 4 September, Taya Kyle wrote on Facebook:Nike, I love your gear, but you exhaust my spirit on this one. Your new ad with Colin Kapernick, I get the message, but that sacrificing everything thing…. It just doesn’t play out here. Sacrificing what exactly? A career? I’ve done that both times I chose to stay home and be with my kids instead of continuing my business climb… and it wasn’t sacrificing everything. It was sacrificing one career and some money and it was because of what I believe in and more importantly, who I believe in.At best, that is all Colin sacrificed … some money and it’s debatable if he really lost his career over it. Maybe he sacrificed the respect of some people while he gained the respect of others. Or maybe he used one career to springboard himself into a different career when the first was waning. I don’t know. What I do know is, he gained popularity and magazine covers he likely wouldn’t have gotten without getting on his knees or as you say, “believing in something.” I’m also thinking the irony is that while I am not privy to the numbers, it’s likely he gained a lucrative Nike contract. So yeah… that whole “sacrificing everything” is insulting to those who really have sacrificed everything.You want to talk about someone in the NFL sacrificing everything? Pat Tillman. NFL STARTING, not benched, player who left to join the Army and died for it. THAT is sacrificing everything for something you believe in.How about other warriors? Warriors who will not be on magazine covers, who will not get lucrative contracts and millions of followers from their actions and who have truly sacrificed everything. They did it because they believed in something. Take it from me, when I say they sacrificed everything, they also sacrificed the lives of their loved ones who will never be the same. THAT is sacrificing everything for something they believe in.Did you get us talking? Yeah, you did. But, your brand recognition was strong enough. Did you teach the next generation of consumers about true grit? Not that I can see.Taking a stand, or rather a knee, against the flag which has covered the caskets of so many who actually did sacrifice everything for something they believe in, that we all believe in? Well, the irony of your ad..it almost leaves me speechless. Were you trying to be insulting?Maybe you are banking on the fact we won’t take the time to see your lack of judgement in using words that just don’t fit. Maybe you are also banking on us not seeing Nike as kneeling before the flag. Or maybe you want us to see you exactly that way. I don’t know. All I know is, I was actually in the market for some new kicks and at least for now, I’ve never been more grateful for Under Armour."
A feature on CNBC today looked into sales for apparel and Nike was mentioned in the top five.Most desirable label among adolescent age group. Other four were American Eagle-Levi-Gap--Lu-Lu-Lemon.
You know whats coming back? 74 LMAO
This would be like Having OJ to be the face of a glove company
Uglyazz ShoesOrenthal James Simpson said....about the new Nike deal with Colin.
What does avenatti have on Nike
I will also be selling my shares tomorrow.
Zion is gonna sit out the rest if the year because of this. The NCAA and TV networks and fans will all blame nike for that
OH MARES CALLING MARS ANOTHER WEEKEND OF FOOTBALL AND NO KRAPERNICK COMMERCIAL WHY MARES ????YOU SEEM TO THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL TELL US WHY THEY WONT SHOW THE COMMERCIAL
DON'T HESITATE ...GET OUT!....GET OUTTA THIS THING BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
PE very high
A vote for democrats is a vote for open borders.
Ha ha - DOWN GOES NIKE! Anti-American company going to $50/share. Great to see.
will touch higher levels soon
don't buy converse either because Nike owns it
"So much far higher highs! This is going to drop quite a bit over the next several days. Look at the previous peaks this year, approximately once per month there is a peak and a fall that takes at least 3 days to bottom out. We should expect the same here. Going to be large drop on high volume followed by a couple more sessions of falling. If major technical barriers are broken, it will fall even farther as stops get executed. This is 80% institutional owned so you will see some paid articles trying to get a rebound, but it may fail. Nothing they can do when everybody else is selling."
"For those worried about the decline in price, don't worry. On a technical basis NKE is overbought. I'm hearing rumors that good things are taking place behind the scenes for this country. It will be a shock to radicals libs so might shake things up. Hedge with BTC, gold and 10 yr Ts. Looking good!"
Picked up a nike golf ball on a fairway and chucked it into a pond!
which genius at nike thought this was a good idea?
okay this add really got some people riled up BUT where do you guys think NIKE is going as a stock from here
"I DEMAND THAT YOU DO IT! OK, DON'T DO IT! KRAPERNICK CAN'T DO IT - HE WAS FIRED!"
"50----50--ELECTION---so Nike lost the 50 % that voted for Trump----that will sink in , 50% of the population HATE -Nike -----Nov- December sales---down--20--30%-----let the Dems buy the company"
I loved. It. I Said. SIT DOWN
Stocks are taking a beatingbut this anti-police/America one has been going down for a week if not longer!
And stocks are down 3%. Weeeeeeeee
Back to the 70s. Far out man

"Prophet, those are annual overall sales!"
SEEMS THE BIG BLUE WAVE HAS FADED ROFLMAO
Canada and Nike are &%^&ed
Maga tip of the day!Make sure to take the sneaker OFF YOUR FOOT before burning. This has been a problem today
Why aren't Kaepernick sympathizers flocking to buy this stock? Probably cause there aren't many that are investors. Wake up Nike board of directors!
"So after all the hullabaloo, it's pretty much where the stock was before the campaign."
"NINE bucks ABOVE the 50 day average.,SHORT IT...it will retrace!!!!!!!"
68 PE and a horribly chosen ad campaign. Sounds like an opportunity to make money on the downside.
Can't do it! ought to be Kape and Nike new theme. kape could be a great backup in Canadian Football league.

Nike takes a knee for China !What would kapernick say ? https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/pence-says-nike-s-china-behavior-checks-conscience-at-the-door
Maybe they are counting on the leftist socialist to provide everyone with sneakers regardless if they EARN them or not. Brilliant thinking Nike.
Does the blue wave look like the NKE swoosh??
EXCELLENT ? JOHNNY
Took my recent purchase of $300 in golf attire back to store today...Just doin’ it!!!
"Nike CEO on conference call now with O.J., Bill Cosby, and Louis Farrakhan."
I WILL ASK FOR THE 3RD AND LAST TIME CAN ANYONE HERE THAT SUPPORTS NIKE PLEASE TELL ME WHY WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE COMMERCIAL SINCE OPENING NIGHT
Many companies make shoes.No more Nikes for me.
I believe that Trump should institute a 100% tariff on all Nike and related products today to show support for our troops and American law enforcement.
Colin Kaepernick? I guess OJ Simpson was busy.
"I took a risk and bought 500 shares at around $69. I got lucky. I will be selling all my shares today at around the $108 mark. I'm a little concerned for the next few quarters: Publicity, Politics and the Wuhan Virus may affect consumers disposable income for a while. Just my thoughts. I hope everyone else bought low as well."
"If I got caught stealing/reselling things from my work, I’d certainly be going to prison, but since my Mommy isn’t VP of Nike, sadly I can’t get away with it. Wish I had the time and knowledge to write put options, I’d be doing it on this one and AMZN. This stock was a dog before this, now it’s a dead dog."
"I bought my 13 year old son a UA football and new UA sneakers for school. Also bought a new pair of UA sneakers for myself. About $225 not going to NKE this week. With two boys playing 3 sports each it will add up to thousands per year, which isn't much but it adds up if others follow. Don't like political statements for our gear, in either direction. Stick with sports and athletes please."
beautiful head and shoulders top formation here...a break of the neckline at around 79.25 will signal a move to 75..enjoy
"Funny, I was going to buy a pair today; I just changed my mind!"
50s coming next week
"67 cents per share , cost is 84,00 Enough said. This stock should sell for 20. per share."
Buh bye
"If within the next short period this will drop below $125, prepare for a trip down south fast. Just a simple graph observation alongside the current trend"
Nike just slapped every service man and woman in the face. Stick to your shoes and not politics. I for one will never buy another Nike product.
Hope this drops 10 today
The only thing that makes a better fire than old Nike shoes are new Nike shoes.
Nike underestimated the power of the American Patriot.
Overpriced even without Krapernick.
"Managed to buy more at 143.9 yesterday. Earnings are gonna be fantastic, as sales will be impacted by NY/Christmas, Super Boul and the shopping gap that emerged in early months of 2020."
"Colin Kaepernick Shares Workout Video, Doesn’t Throw A Single Football In It.If he was any good, or good enough to be worth dealing with, he would be playing!"
"Bring in a cut-up Nike logo , get 20% DISCOUNT-------STORES -do it----make hay when the sun shines---buy new shoes -----get 20% off --cut-up Nike logo------new shoes at a discount"
Still the worst year in the markets since the Great Bush RecessionTrump trails Obama in job creation and market gains.Cheers
If Kapernick really cared he would get a job as cop. I will never purchase a product or one share of stock of a company that disrespects the National Anthem.
Just wait til Xmas. 50% of America not buying
"Nike seems to flipping off middle America with this statement:‘You can be darn sure that Nike has done its research and knows what will move its product and who this campaign will resonate with. They are the ones [Nike has] decided will be its future customers, so, if others are getting upset, [Nike has] planned for that, and it doesn’t care.’ Aaron Goldman, 4C Insights"
Nike is down 4.90% to 126.07
"""I still don't understand why anyone is buying NKE products.""Buying? No...................Looting? Yup.............."
Nike is the next Netflix / Starbucks. Watchout below.
Here's an old vid Richard posted of himself..........worth reposting.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfCBVV23ztU
"Change the station as soon as this ad shows. Nike thinks they can disrespect the people of USA and honor someone that disrespects our police, our soldiers and our people. Nike is bad. Buy Adidas, they have the same $8 shoes sold for $150 too."
"I am not going to burn my Nike apparel or shoes that i have been using in 4 different sports. However, as replacement is needed I am going with New Balance, Under Armor and Addidas."
Does Nike help our GDP out? If they make it all overseas by Chinese slave labor is it really ethical to keep supporting them? I could put Apple and others in the same boat making cheap products and selling them for astronomical prices. I’ll buy American bye Nike 
"NIKE Earnngs FAIL! Day 1 - Down, Day 2 - still Down LOL!"
"I hear so many people talking about dropping Nike, cancelling their team's orders. This is going to be bad."
"Nike, Kapernick and the rest of the fake news need to watch this video.. Oh no that doesn't fir their narrative??https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5uYCWVfuPQ"
liberals look desperate right now. they are saying anything to cover the wounds of this damaged company. LOL
"Taking a stand, or rather a knee, against the flag which has covered the caskets of so many who actually did sacrifice everything for something they believe in, that we all believe in? Well, the irony of your ad..it almost leaves me speechlessTaya Kyle"
"Just read in another article, that the President of Iran tweeted his support for Kaepernick. Sounds about right."
goin down!!!!!
I don't currently own. anyone buying here going into earnings? or too risky with China uncertainty?
"Just because investor sentiment favors Nike today does not mean that the alledged ""failed"" boycott will not take its toll and show up in the next couple of quarters. I for one will not buy another Nike product and a lot of other folks I know have said the same thing."
And I’ll proudly Stand Up God Bless The USA
After it gets to 71.50 the next target would be 60
NIKE depending on Antifa parents and Drug Dealers to keep their FAILING business running!!
Thans Joe B.
"Next time don't take a knee and disrespect United States Military, Police, Firefighters, and the Flag Nike...Nike unofficially banned on all United States Military Installations."
"so Nike shares jumped after commercial,but if they knew that they would lose a core business ,the soccer mom's, veterans,fire fighters, police,shame on them they work for the share holders and not there own agenda ,wise up"
"Just Do It! no, JUST RETURN IT!"
Never Nike.
"I'll do more than ""Just do it""....I'll just not BUY IT. No respect for you Nike."
everybody short this. this will be fun to be apart of
Nke- Wayover bought. There are no active sports going on to support this growth
NKE is way over valued.Kraepernik burst the bubble!!
shoes are out-of-fashion. barefoot is the new cool
Nike=Snowflake company
Any person to openly disrespect their country isn't a role model...he's no MLK. Tell Colin to spend some time in South Chicago where people are killing each other. All people matter and he should try to bring us together rather than divide us and categorize people. I'm out of Nike stock tomorrow.
"Nike looking at Ted Bundy or Charles Manson for next commercial....Oh, wait they're dead. CEO stepping down end of year."
With the NFL stepping in and not allowing the campaign to air on NFL games... the controversy will only increase as the libs claim foul...But the NFL should have the right to say they dont want someone who is suing them to have a platform for his case air on their programingNIKE loses big here...If they get to reup their NFL deal in the future its gonna cost them for this clusterF...And that OF the NFL will even consider it... it all boils down to jersey sales moving forward
look at that trump market!
Wonder if they ran this by Tiger. A few days ago he said we need to respect each other and the institution of America.
"My kids love Nike . My questions is why? Nike shoes are over priced, they wear out way to soon, and Nike has the no godly side to them, I been over Nike for years but now my kids are refusing to purchase them,"
"In a column that is likely to dismay readers on the Fox News website, conservative attorney Andrew McCarthy – a regular contributor to National Review Online — said that it is inevitable that President Donald Trump is going to be indicted by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney that he appointed for campaign finance violations."
Nobody screams injustice better than a liberal. Funny stuff.
I’m never buying Nike again!!!
sighhhhhh. had to sell my 700k shares w/ avg of .0125 that i bought since january because there was another dilution WITHOUT any news. will probably come back whenever lenny addresses the Amazon issue and the reason they dilute shares without releasing any PR about it... bought $NKE and $SE 1/21/22 $12k each stocks.
Did no one catch that cfo said rev would be flat first half 2021. Would think that would drop the stock
Q4 will be a disaster for Nike. There are too many people that disagree with their divisive marketing approach. Plethora of other bands available and better quality. Bye bye Nike.
"Didn't Nike brag that it has gotten $43 million of free press? I guess that's not the kind of free you want. So far, a negative $12.7 billion. Shouldn't have done it."
$60s lol
"And your favorite Under Armor will not make ANY money in 2019!No NKE stock, no NKE purchases by you and your types. NEXT!"
"Nike is overvalued, besides Kap putting cap on any increases in earnings and share price. Patriots apparently have other options to pursue."
Nike sales went to zero in the US after Zion's shoe blew out.
"The point of the ""right"" should be to inform the liberals on how Nike products are made in Asian swear shops...Then they lose everyone but the Kap lovin fist raising crowd"
Nike.....Just Blew It
"SUCH A GREAT ADD CAMPAIGN, WHY WON'T NIKE RUN THE COMMERCIAL ANY MORE ??????? COMMERCIAL FADED FASTER THEN KRAPERNICKS FOOTBALL CAREER ROFLMAO"
My $85 short still looking good!
Hey Nike UA LOOKIN’GOOD. Check Wed/today’s UA stock chart. Going LONG UA tomorrow. So are a lot of others.
who is going to hold the bag at 75? LOL
I personally feel like Adidas is a better brand in general than Nike and people should invest their time into it instead
long term avoidance of nike will have its affect.
"The share price of Nike a couple days after the Krapernick ad dropped was at $88-$90. Why does Zee keep saying the boycott started at $50 when it's so easy to discredit? That's a good example of the low information gullibility expected from people who wear a company's ""swoosh"" branding."
"Don't buy Nike. The new Just Do It, just blew it."
NO MORE NIKE FOR ME!!!
Um yea. Looks like it’s breaking down
Chris Korman's choice of most important athlete of the decade played little more than half a decade in the NFL. In six years he threw just 72 touchdown passes and lost 30 of 58 games as a starting quarterback..
Just think this is during the good times.Just wait until the Kraepernik COLLAPSE kicks in
"In addition to the dropping of Nike at the collegiate level because of the demands of big donors, Nike will no longer be used by thousands of high schools at the insistence of PTOs and parents. Yes, a brilliant marketing campaign by the snowflakes in Portland."
China already started to boycott NIKE. Down 20% tomorrow
Sky looks blue with some clouds
no way will this stay afloat
I might try on some Nike shoes next time I am at a store that sells them. The shoes I try on will have to be removed from the shelves when I'm done.
Nice comeback for the Markets.Somebody must have forgotten to tell NKE about it.
Kraepernick will do for Nike business what its done to NFL business.Look out below!
This is a week away from a monumental drop.
IM GUESSING GILLUM WILL PULL OUT THE RACE CARD TOMORROW
"NKE longs, I'm about to sell your shares. Don't worry, though, I'll return them to you before the bankruptcy."
#$%$ nike
Is their CEO a BLM memeber? Just curious?
Just sell it!
Colon Kaepernick was a mediocre to poor player - dropped for inconsistent and poor playing ability ... if he had any ability he would of been retained or traded...he wasn't....he only had one hot season because he threw fast and wild and got lucky.....
Dr. Ford wears NikeBelieve in something. Even if you can't remember anything.
Down how much tomorrow?
NIKE blew U.S. sales when they hired Kraepernik so that won't help and Internationally the Markets have Tanked.Who are they going to sell to? Future looks bleak for NIKE.
SELL! SELL! SELL!
Telling illegals vote for me I’ll get you in the country is not a plan
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MORE LIBERAL TEARS THIS ELECTION SEASON!!!!
Lock in any profits now and dump this stock
"I just researched this stock today. In my opinion, only my opinion; this stock is WAY overvalued. I do not understand why people, maybe new investors with no knowledge of fundamentals and valuation, buy stocks just on name. Nike products are a joke, They spend all their money on promotions, advertising, and paying big stars big money to pump poorly made, cheap products. This is probably a good short, especially when China is boycotting Nike and will most likely shut down American brands. Tesla is at risk too."
DemonRatz will all be voted OUT this Nov...
i'm placing the DEMOCRATIC PARTY on suicide watch when the RED TIDAL WAVE hits next Tuesday.
NEW KRAPERNICK SHOE....LEFT FOOT ONLY
The effect of divesting hasn't even truly begun. Steep drop incoming in a few hours.
only a few weeks till the 60s.
"Harvey Weinstein, OJ Simpson, and Edward Snowden all had prior commitments which is why they finally settled on Kaepernick."
Nike going to plummet after christmas
I was one of those soldiers I support the right to protest that is what separate us from Russia.
"Had a cousin who works for Nike with talent. Judging from the way he treated the talent he was hanging around with for the day, I'm guessing their attitude is just to let them get away with anything they want. Most of these pro athletes out there are dirtbags, encouraged by sycophants and companies who just want a piece of the money they earn. It seems like the more soulless you are in this industry, the more likely you are to succeed.I never respected my cousin much after my encounter with him and his clients. Funniest thing is that for him, it never paid off, he's still some low-level scrub after all these years."
"Illegals don’t pay taxes, but they get tax refunds."
Hannity is on the NYAG’s radar. Stay tuned!
nike will fall 20% nobody is buying nike brand. better hope for jordan
Buffett warned CEOs long ago to leave your politics at home- you are in Business- not politics !
Back in 84’ I spent $10k on Nike stock at $.11/share. Moral of the story keep your stock and never sell through the good times and even more importantly the bad times.
"As Jan Kiffin said, ""Couldn't Nike have spent the money in a better way?"""
Now the kneelers can hang out together on the street corner drinking thunderbird
"i rarely short but this the time, this is the one.may nike go down in flames."
How’s that trend line prophet
Adidas makes better gear now anyway
"Nike and Kaepernick is all you need to know. This stock will tank now. As well as the tariffs on China, come on Nike is making bad choices."
I got paid today I'm happy Will use profits to short. Do it again tomorrow
im excited about how bad the earnings will be
"well, at least we now know what Nike really is... after already knowing they love child labor"
"Honorable protests or not, NO ONE ever wins going up against patriotic Americans. This is a big lose for Nike. Someone like JJ Watts, whose foundation raised $44 million dollars for Houston Hurricane victims, would have been a far smarter and worthy face of NIKE"
Can anyone say $165 is on the way?
Bought the dip at 67... easy $
CRASHHHH Post Kraepernik Low has been BROKENSeeya @ 71.50!!

Colin and I will be married by the end of the year

"I'm a couple of days early, but I wish everyone a happy 4th of July, except Kaepernick and Nike. It's a racist holiday to them."
#justburnit is the new hashtag going around. What other brands does NIKE own?
looks like yahoo is starting to delete messages again...
NIKE JUST DID IT
"I have to admit that I love they way NKE keeps burning the naysayers and shorts ... along with the faux-patriots, racists, bigots and trumpturds ... wait! ... did somebody just say they are one and the same? ... come to think of it that does make sense."
Stopped buying any Nike products on September 4th. Hello Adidas!
"Anyone familiar with the developing Augmented Reality Industry? A reported 2 trillion industry by 2027. Found this company ImagineAR, IP or IPNFF with a great buy level that is niche focused in mobile AR. Due your DD, but this seems to have the potential of major growth in this AR market in sports and marketing, has former NFL quarterback Gus Frerotte to pursue NFL opportunities. Looks like an amazing entry point."
Eventually Nike pays a price for its actions.
Why on earth would they make a decision like that and politically hurt the company. Even if you agree or disagree with someones views why would Nike get themselves involved and hurt investors. Makes absolute no sense. Sell you shares now and recoup down the road.
put option heaven
"The new Nike Slogan... ""Just Short It"" ,"
anyone else getting deleted when they talk about heinz 57 states? you know heinz 57 states attended a church with a pastor who was critical of the people that were killed today.
support NIKE. BUY BUY BUY！
84 to 70. OUCH!
Simple Boycott Nike products for ever and ever. I am done with them.
Nike will show a loss next quarter. Reports of factory workers eating the shoes when management isn't watching. Not much nutritional value but it keeps the stomach from making that swoosh sound oppressed labor often has.
Just wait till next quarter. Millions of middle class families like mine who have upwards of 10 pairs of Nikes in the closet now have sworn to never buy Nike again. They will miss revenue badly next quarter.
Buy American made sneakers. Sketchers and Asics. American Jobs!
"The poor NKE shorts must have lost a lot of money during this 10-year bull market! Wow! Today, NKE is paying shareholders once again, with a gain almost twice that of the Dow 30! Fantastic performance, Nike! Thank you!"

Who do I call at Nike to tell them how much I disagree with what they have done?Please post a name and phone #
Attention Nike employees!! Going forward your new emergency phone # is 0.00. 911 is only reserved for hard working Americans who respect our great police force!
The 13% rule.
Blue Wave FAIL.3 Senators picked up.NICE!
The ad effect maybe reflected in future quaterly earnings.
This stock is doomed. $65
Good luck America and a special thanks to the liberal democrats. You've succeeded in ruining the country. There is literally nothing that you haven't infected.
NKE Sales Collapse?? UH OH!
In other news.....the IVAN(ka) tRUMP clothing line just released it’s new fall line up........
Short Kneeke into the grave.

NKE did announce as a follow-up that it's coming out with a Louis Farrakhan shoe.
Join the ever growing boycott NKE movement! Never NKE!!
"Classy, inspiring commercial...$85 by week's end and $100 by Christmas."
"Shame on you NIKE, will never buy your products or stock 11 Respect the country and it's FLAG !!!!"
We will see back to $60s soon.
Personally I don't buy Nike's stock or their products. Both are over priced. It seems the company enjoys setting up these controversies. Let's be sensitive to everyone. Another piece to this is that in a number of cultures it is considered an insult to show the heel of your foot. Putting any SYMBOL on the heel of a shoe should be an insult. I will buy under armor products and ADDIDAS their products are better anyway.
Who else hates progressive millennials?
Average NKE shareholder
"This is not about Kap, its about business. Nike is not afraid to go the other direction. They did it with Jordan, Tiger Woods, Kobe Bryant, and Charles Barkley. They have grown 50 times over since those times because that is what they do. They use those names to market their product to improve sales."
NKE OVERVALUED and CRASHING due to Kraepernik plus ton of overhead resistance with all LOSING positions bought over $75.Looking Bleak!!
Triple average volume yesterday and it closed slightly up after opening WAY down in comparison. I'd say the bears are winning at this point. Let's see how much the millennials can hold it up today on the Robinhood app. My guess is today is the day they lose the battle and it goes further south.
false positive this stock is going down ..
Libtard pundits on TV will furiously defend this stock like their baby....to no avail because the real damage will come in millions of painful cuts in coming months and years.
"wow everything you guys come up with is ""he said, she said"" Don't you realize that's getting you no where. The media has you spun up over nothing. Next week there will be a new smear story. Nothing will come of it. Are you catching on yet?"

2:1 split @ $140?Would be Nike's 8th.
"How can Nike be so dumb making this move. Just figure how many millions people voted for Trump plus however many millions that supported Trump but being silent plus how many millions don't support Trump but feel offended about NFL kneeling while anthem playing. Then, multiply that with the number of pairs of shoes they would buy. That will be the lost of sales. Get out of this stock while you can."

"Iconic name brand positioned to move higher. This is big statement tonight. I've been patient with this Nike as it's become a core position. Wish my shares were 100+ but sure am glad I targeted this as a COVID play in March when it was in the 60s. Nike will continue to evolve beyond the brick & mortar outlets it was once completely tied to. Donahoe at helm (formerly Service NOW CEO), taking company to new heights. Just Do it"
NKE changed the perception of their products so much with one AD. I personally wore their shoes because they were a good product. Now when I see something NKE I throw up in my month. Would never consider anything NKE again. that is a big change in customer loyalty from one ad. No matter how much the USA is attacked she has been a great country and we all should appreciate this country
"gary, your nike company is failing just like the blue wave. it's obvious you are angry because your blue wave was a big failure."
What did Colin Kaepernick kneel for and how was it bad for the people of the USA?

Here are a few kind words for your Board; FILA, Adidas, Sketchers, Puma, Under Armour, New Balance, Reebok."
What stock in the stores during the riots Has to be replaced￼ Which means their sales will be up
Scared money don’t make none. Another missed earnings day opportunity.
You can’t take my guns away.... “corn pop is a bad dude”

"According to Forbes, Nike's marketing plan is to focus on 12 ""Key Cities"" in its Consumer Direct Offense: New York, London, Shanghai, Beijing, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Mexico City, Barcelona, Seoul, and Milan.These are the places the company predicts will generate over 80% of Nike’s projected growth through 2020."

79 PE? Still cheaper then most tech stocks. Do we reach $175 by end of 21?
Great idea higher a millionaire spokesman who hates America and complains he is oppressed while your company is selling sneakers made by Chinese workers living in poverty. New Balance and Assics are high quality and made by American workers making a living wage in AMERICA. The only market for Nikes will be the criminals who support the nfl and are likely to shoplift the shoes.
Isn't everyone going to buy new sneakers with their $1400? Why are we going down today?

"WHY SENS will dominate DEXOM in 3 years.""I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond."
"I will stay open-minded and see if Nike recognizes its serious error of judgement. I fully understand the marketing strategy to be provocative, edgy and cutting-edge. However, this is a for-profit company with many stakeholders of all persuasions. To firmly make a stand (or take a knee) on such a polarizing issue is a serious misstep at a time when the company is losing market share to Under Armor, Adidas, Puma, etc. We all need erasers on our pencils and Nike is no exception. The question remains as to whether the company will use its eraser in this instance."
To those that don’t know: Kap is a known supporter of Fidel Castro! A dictator of communism! This is now the face of Nike! Most disturbing!
"CEO Parker is sure ""GIVING IT UP"" for something you believe in? For the Nike/Kapernick AD /HOAX???

Does anyone think this will help their sales? I just don't see how it will. Just #$%$ of half your customers before going into the holiday season. And your not going to bring any new customers in by doing the campaign. People that say now people are just going to buy more of it are dumb. People that will support him will just keep buying nike and the people against will either stop or second guess their purchase.

"The MAGAS citing that Nike products aren't selling in their hometowns are also failing to mention they live in the rural deep south towns with populations of 50,000 and under. Nike is doing great is large metropolitan cities and suburbs where most of their consistent buyers actually shop. icks Sporting Good in Pearland, TX told me that Nike sales are doing as well as they typically do. Nike is placed at the front of this store and the manager advsied me that product placement is determined by corporate Agreements in place and has absolutely nothing to do with sentiment. Leave it to MAGAs to make up lies and tell stories. Pearland, TX a suburb of the third most populous city in America has a population of 120,000 and serves multiple 5 or 6A high schools. MAGAs are short on facts but long in lies, stories, and ""rumors"" lol."
Sales miss
forecast for the next quarter?
"Widow Of Slain Police Officer Writes Open Letter To Nike That Goes ViralSeptember 7, 2018 A police officer’s widow, expressing her personal repugnance for the new Colin Kaepernick ad campaign for Nike, wrote a profoundly moving open letter to the company that has since gone viral.Kaepernick has expressed his hostility toward America’s police in various ways, from wearing socks with pigs dressed as police officers to comparing police officers to fugitive slave patrolmen.Sherry Graham-Potter, the widow of Pima County, Ariz., Sheriff’s Deputy Tim Graham, who was killed in 2005 when he was struck and killed by an oncoming vehicle while Graham tried to prevent an emotionally disturbed man from getting killed on the highway, wrote the letter, which starts by relating what happened to her husband, whose death left her raising two young sons alone. The letter then tells of the terrible grief she suffered after his death, and the Nike cap that she wore while recovering that became a symbol of the “strength and the sacrifice” of her husband.Then, the powerful conclusion.The complete letter is below:Dear Nike,I want to have a conversation about this hat. It’s over 13 years old. I don’t remember when I bought it exactly, I don’t remember where I bought it. But what I do remember is why I wore it.On August 10, 2005, I was a newlywed with two young sons. My husband Tim and I had toasted our one month anniversary the night before, and I was enjoying a rare evening to myself, catching up on reading and relishing the quiet. Until there was a knock on my door. I had no way of knowing that the small act of turning a knob was about to shatter my life into a million pieces. I sat numb and in sheer disbelief as I was told that my husband, while in a foot pursuit and subsequent struggle with a suspect that ended up in the road, had been struck and killed by an oncoming vehicle. He took his last breath lying in the middle of the street.What I lost in that moment is indescribable. I had to watch his mom be dealt the most agonizing blow a parent can face, and I couldn’t comfort her because I was in my own hell. I had to find a way to gut my own kids in the gentlest way possible, and tell them that this man they had come to love, who they looked up to, who cared for them as his own, would never walk through our door again.I don’t know if you’ve ever attended a police funeral, but watching grown men who’ve seen the absolute worst things a civilian can imagine, break down and sob over the casket of their brother is an image that never leaves you. The bagpipes haunt my dreams to this day, but it was the faces of my kids, the innocence that abandoned them at such a tender age that brought me to my knees.I had no choice but to move on. We trudged zombie-like through our days for weeks and weeks on end. I never left the house except to drive the boys to school, or buy food we barely touched. I realized that I had to do something. I had to move my body or I was going to crawl out of my own skin. So I put on the only cap I had and I went for a run. It was short, it hurt and it was ugly. But I felt, just for those few moments on that road, like a normal person. So I kept doing it. I put that hat on and I ran every day. Sometimes I had to stop and sit down because I was sobbing so hard. Sometimes I was so angry I ran until I thought I my heart would stop, sometimes I would just scream over and over again, but it still felt better than doing nothing.That black cap became a symbol to me, it is sweat stained and it’s shape is gone, the buckle in the back barely closes; but that hat represents my family’s rise from the ashes. It stands for the strength and the sacrifice we made loving a man who had a job that we all knew could end his life, every time he walked out that door. And it did. And I accept that.I still wear this hat, I wore it on my run this morning.And then I heard about your new ad campaign.Colin Kapernick has the absolute right to protest anything he damn well pleases. I don’t dispute that for one second. My father, my husband and many, many friends have all served this country and were willing to fight for his right to kneel.But that right goes both ways. I also have a right to express my disgust at your decision to portray him as some kind of hero. What, exactly has Colin Kapernick sacrificed? His multi-million dollar paycheck…? Nope, you already gave him one of those. His reputation? No, he’s been fawned over by celebrities and media alike. Funny, Tim Tebow was never called courageous when he knelt.This man, whose contempt for law enforcement fits him like a…sock, has promoted an agenda that has been proven false time and time again, in study after study. But facts don’t seem to matter anymore. This man has thrown his support behind divisive anti-police groups, and donated money directly to a fugitive from justice who escaped prison"
If it’s about principal and not $ is Kaepernick representing Nike for free so they can pay more to sweat shops in all the country’s that make Nike products.
"I am always amused when the Fox News and Blotus following MAGADUPED refer to ‘media’ in an attempt to distance themselves from some news outlets unfavorable to their views.

"Kaepernick and his like are ignorant. Slavery was an imported institution from the old world and likely began in Africa. My white great grandfather fought under the American flag to first end slavery's progression into new states and then to end it for all time in the south. i truly believe the most rabid racists in America are currently black. His behavior and that of the black racists may ignite a white backlash and the gains of the past century in civil rights could be lost. Impossible? Just look what happens when a citizenry has been put under severe stress, financial or otherwise, in other countries."

Looks like the news media will not report Nike's less than stellar performance with kaepernick as their main hero. When the stcok was 84.00 the Yahoo front page wanted you to believe it was because of kaep...now that it is tanking no word on same front pages. Go Kaep Go!

He was lambasted for it and said it was to protest black injustice, an obvious lie. Glad he’ll never play another down again. Side note, since his “protest” he’s worn clothing depicting cops as pigs and wore a shirt in support of a mass murderer (Castro). If you support police and what America stands for, you’ll never buy Nike again"

Nike showing Kap ad tonight’s game. S gonna hit fan. Prob see bonfires of burning shoes and jerseys.
Nike is pumping its North America sales by purchasing its product and returning it to inventory. The cost of sales has climbed in lock step with Revenues causing the margins to decrease. They know the analyst are wrongly focused on sales revenue instead of earnings. Revenues are up while earnings are below last years. At minimum earnings should be flat with last year if revenue was truly up. I am looking at these numbers prior to G& A costs so the decrease operating income is not from increase in R&D and marketing. Eventually this will be wrung out when net income continues to fall.

Nike stock is going to take a big hit today!
Why would anyone hire a guy who spends more time being a disrupting activiSt than he does studying defenses. No wonder he didn’t get a job. I guess he did not realize or see what he was doing. Clearly you would want your quarterback focussed on the game not what kinds of socks he is going to wear.

Stockholders??? How long can the NIKE Management Team be allowed to flounder?? Destroy Nike?? Keep and $$4 Pay Kapernick to publicly destroyed SHIPPED promotions...Management MUST GO!"
I am stick just sick about Nike and I figure it is going to get worse. I can't afford to pay anymore taxes on my profit but it will slowly slip away. I hate it when people make decisions that affect my financial health and those decisions by Nike were not thought out. There surely could have been something that could have created shareholder value. This was the worse thing possible to destroy shareholder value and I am sure the owners of the NfL teams are sick about it too since it creates ill feelings about the NFL and they were in hopes that things wo9ld level off this year on the kneeling problem. Now people are talking about not watcing NFL games and that hurts advertising revenue.

Installation is faciliated by the use of bio-magnetic glue. The ZeroMaxUltra strip technology developed by Nike is based on 50 patented functional and biometric fit design features. It is available only to professional athletes, but a consumer version of this earth-shattering running system breakthrough is expected to be available to the general public in the coming months at an introductory price of $499. Appointments can be reserved online only and picked up at select Nike Stores."
"I think the current price is essentially a prop up. After Nike makes there CK political move, the stock dropped a fair bit... as it should have. Then, a number of people bought into the notion that Nike is global and they'll power through the backlash and really score with their ""target"" audience. To some extent this is true, and the price was bought back up. But.. you don't #$%$ off a huge portion of the American society to the point that they commit to never buying your products again without sever consequences...imo. There were so many better options out there than picking CK and his faux national cause, and that's what really slaps these Americans, of which I am one, in the face. Sure... Nike will have more mentions online, and sure... they'll survive off shallow liberals and internationals who don't get it. But when the numbers truly come in... the $80's won't hold.

"Nike is like gopro once was. Trading on support from product fanatics, except nike is intensified by kaperwack supporters and detractors. Eventually gopro could not hide revenue numbers and it fell from $90 trading range to where it trades today, below $10. Nike, through political activism has alianated a large portion of their client base and to compound matters was trading at a premium for it's sector due ti it's ""feel good"" appeal. Like gopro revenue will undermine the premium of good will and Nike will do a swam dive similar to what under armour did. Program trading will not hold it up once revenue numbers reflecting the customers lost due to kaperwack effect can no longer be hidden. Gopro did the same thing. Nike, political,activism and athletic wear are not compatible. For the NFL team loyalty eventually trumped kaperwack effect. Nike does not have that cushion and many athletic wear mfg's are thanking you for their new found customera. Kaperwack introduced doubt. To compound it nike played with the numbers last quarter to hide revenue lost so add trust in management to th list of ills. Nike, fifties and lower in 2019. Market rally might prop it up but it will be temporary, till next earnings report."

The same divisiveness in America that Hanoi Jane Fonda created was duplicated by Kaepernick. The topic may differ. Both Protested Noble and Just causes. But BOTH Failed by choosing the wrong way.
"Sports and HeroesWilma Rudolph Born prematurely and later beset by crippling illness that forced her to wear a metal leg brace for years, Rudolph somehow overcame the obstacles of her childhood to become a world-class athlete. She won a bronze medal in the 4 x 100-meter relay in the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, but her true triumph came four years later, in Rome. Rudolph blew past the competition to win the 100-meter dash in 11.0 seconds, a record time that wasn't recorded as such due to above-average wind gusts, and then easily won the 200-meter final. Running the anchor leg of the 4 x 100-meter relay, Rudolph shrugged off a bad baton relay and overtook the lead runner to become the first American woman to win three gold medals in one Olympics. Underscoring both the era in which she lived and the ability of a great athlete to act as a catalyst of change, her celebratory homecoming parade and gala banquet were the first fully integrated municipal events in the history of Clarksville, Tennessee.Wow, she overcame a crippling illness; first American woman to win three gold medals in the Olympics; triumphed over “Jim Crow” era prohibitions. A real sports hero. Sure it is “history” and who cares about history anymore. Certainly not Nike. Their “hero” is a dude with a plethora of hair. Colin Kaepernick.So how was this Kaepernick rated? “ With multiple players claiming the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback had been blackballed by the league for sparking protests during the playing of the national anthem, a subject that dominated the past two NFL seasons and drew criticism from President Trump, The Washington Post tracked the statistical performance of each team’s top passer to see how they measured up to Kaepernick’s 2016 averages. Over the course of the season, 10 quarterbacks were worse than Kaepernick, 7 were about the same (plus or minus 0.35 ANY/A) and 15 were better. In other words, he was BELOW center mass. Certainly not the caliber of a Wilma Rudolph. But wait……… he is an activist. He wears socks depicting police who put their lives on the line everyday as pigs…… he is a social justice “warrior”! Well that is a matter of what you read lately. The most noteworthy part of a national anthem before a sporting event used to be a great singing performance or a riveting flyover. Kaepernick told the media after the game he sat because of the oppression of people of color and ongoing issues with police brutality.Here’s what he told NFL.com’s Steve Wyche:“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses Black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”At least 72 people were shot, including 12 fatally, over the weekend in Chicago, another eruption of violence in a city that has struggled with murders and shootings in recent years even as the national homicide rate hovers near historic lows.Police investigated a 13th murder – the slaying of a 32-year-old woman who was found dead around 9 p.m. Sunday in a bathtub with her hands and feet bound. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office was scheduled to conduct an autopsy Monday to determine how the woman, Shantel Boler, was slain.No arrests have been made in any of the incidents, but police said investigators have strong leads for some of the shootings.I guess he is not protesting that. It is funny how things can be so nuanced. I wonder if the pigs Kaepernick he so playfully had on his socks were able to help those mourning and in need. I hope his “take” from Nike was a biggie. And I am going to recommend other shoe brands…… AdidasAsicsNew BalancePumaReebokRockportSauconySpiraDang, and this week I was going to buy some Nike Huaraches. Well I should feel good about saving that 135 extra dollars. Also, people stop burning your sneakers..... they already paid the little kid in the sweat shop and made their profit."
Serena Williams' behavior today is the second reason for not supporting Nike this week. I do not like how they have the media and celebrities marshal behind her to defend her rotten behavior.
"Just watch any high school, college, or pro football game. Most of the players and coaches are outfitted with Nike. The students and fans have on Nike products. Most Big 12, SEC, ACC, Pac 10, and Big 10 schools are outfitted by Nike or Jordan. The entire NFL is outfitted by Nike so all of that gear the fans are wearing in the stadium and at bars or at home are wearing Nike products. Nike isn't going anywhere people."

Globalist Nike will be lucky if it sustains itself in the 40s. Evil subversive brands should go bankrupt.
Good luck Raiders selling their Mack/Nike jerseys.
Anybody see the heavyset silver back running after that tennis ball
People were gloating that Nike didn’t fall immediately after Cap debacle. They were forgetting a typical shoe cycle is 6-12 months. This stock will fall HARD over the next few months as a result from their social engineering efforts from a few months back. Good riddance.
1 gap down 2 more to go = 74.51 / 72.19
"Did I read a rumor that NIKE is changing their tag line to ""Just SCREW it!"" With Mr. Colinoscopy, it would certainly make sense."
Called $100 per share back in March. Check my previous posts. Haters keep hating while I keep making money on this one. With dividend reinvestment I have doubled my money in the last 2 years.
"When will NKE drop the Jordan line and recall the Air Jordan sneakers sold in the past 25 years? This is the worst type of racial stereotyping- using a b-ball player to hawk shoes. If Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben',s, and Mrs Butterworth are gone, Jordan had better be gone as well as any other minority athletes endorsing any products."

Never buy NIKE again.
"STOOGE YOUR LOSING HERE, I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING BUT PLEASE DON'T BOW OUT YET, I REALLY DO ENJOY OUR LITTLE TALKS"
So Nike feels that a weeping widow at a Military Cemetary with her little children have not given up anything but that sissy Colin kaepernick has risked everything. The little children weeping for their dead soldier dad and the wife weeping paints a sad picture. Hopefully Nike executives think that kaepernick has sacrificed MORE than this military family. Remember this when you buy your next pair of exercise shoes.
What a fruit loop!.

"A post just for the record. Don't buy Nikeing tennis shoes called ""Monarch""!! They squeak so loud you could not sneak up on a bulldozer!! These shoes give a new meaning to the word ""Sneakers"".. I tried to contact Nike about them but then saw it is no use people posted all over the place about the ""Squeaky shoes""; Nikeing refuses to help. It is a big problem and they don't care. All the folks that posted about them said good luck getting your money back, it won't happen. The shoes are useless can't wear them out in public. I did go and buy 3 pair of Skechers Sneakers, love them they are most comfortable shoes I ever owned, light as a feather and look great too!! Nikeing does not care that they made a bad product, their a dishonest company!! There was no way to get satisfaction from rotten shoes they sold, Shame on them!! Will never buy another product from Nikeing!!You know they knew this was a bad shoe and did nothing to help customers!!"

NKE is lying about impact using coached words like offsetting to buy time. Offsetting is word that does not mean 1 for 1. Under Armour says sneaker sales will be down 60%. Wells Fargo told all investors that 10% of the entire market will not comeback ever and after a small pent up demand they will be down 50% or more in the retail space.

"I went into a store today, and heard a customer telling the owner of the store that he should be ashamed to be wearing Nike shoes. He was not aware of the situation, and felt bad. He said, as a patriot, he would go home and lunch and immediately remove his shoes. Interesting. I think this is going to leave a mark, as they say"
"***Nike is so successful because they pander to the lowest common denominator ethically, morally, politically, and spiritually, by which humanity is overrun."
I wonder if DKS is sending Nike flowers or something for taking the heat off of them.
52 week high as predicted thank you fried squirrel eaters!
Nike keep shoving. You will be out of business if you keep dis-respecting the American people. I personally hate your company and would never buy from you again.
"JUST THINK IF KAP HAD BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO RETAIN HIS STARTING POSITION NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED. NO PROTEST NO PIG SOCKS WE WOULD ALL BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT NOW, THINK ABOUT THAT, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. NKE"

Nike Is Maintained at Neutral by Baird this morning.
"When Iran's former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad supports you and your hatred of America, the flag and the national anthem then you know you've made a monumental error."
"Wow. Lots of hate here. NKE is just 4% down which makes it only 6% from its all-time high. If the price in after-hours holds tomorrow, NKE will be just 6% lower than it's all-time high. The stock is still up almost 30% since year-to-date (and up 50% over the past 52 weeks). The company had a solid quarter - just not good enough to justify the valuation so profit taking is to be expected. No need to sell if NKE is already a part of your long-term portfolio. For investors who want to put new money to work, wait three days and come in if the stock stays above its 50-day average."
"MARES CLAIMS TO HAVE BOUGHT 20,000 SHARES OF NKE AT 79.50 AND HE THINKS IT'S FUNNY THAT THE MARKET IS CRASHING ????????THERE IS YOUR DUMOCRAT LOGIC"

"Nike should sign up David Duke to a long term contract to put the Nike logo on all of his ceremonial robes. Really....Go For It....or Make it Happen, or whatever their current slogan is. The next one may be Hang Yourself. :-)"
Most Christian Americans stand for the flag and national anthem and Knee for the  cross. Nike run by liberal California democrat
"Next Nike ad campaign - Hijacked airliners destroying the Twin Towers, and Iranian mullahs burning the American flag, while Nike executives cheer. ""Professional analysts"" will say this is edgy and will increase profits!"
Libs think being proud to White is a crime. They flood the country with immigrants fleeing banana republics for more votes and to make us all the same color.

"No one is even kneeling anymore at games. So Nike still has people who would have bought Nike anyways and lost customers who were on the fence.I am telling you, their quarterly earnings are going to be horrible and this ad campaign will quietly disappear. Just watch. They've done it before. Nike will also mysteriously start a bunch of programs supporting police and firefighters.Just watch and see."

"Nike book value is $6 buck a share, and that was before at least half of it’s customer base was and would still buy a Nike product. It’s not worth half of what it was now imo. Time to cut this stock in half at the very least. sell sell sell!"
"""Sure it can be mid $60s if the DOW goes sub 23K which may be in play before earnings."""
Somebody somebody is cooking the books at Nike I don't buy this sales job. And no guidance. Lets see what happens on the open but something smells on this. IMO

Kaepernick's sacrifice: the well being of third world children who make Nike shoes in sweatshops.
Can’t hold the hate. Just let it tank as it will and should.
"I just talked to my buddy who’s big into golf. He said all his friends are done with Nike permanently. This is for sure going to be one of those infamous incredible business suicides, as even the pros haven’t realized how bad this is for Nike. They truly are going to be financially ruined, brand name ruined, tarnished history for life. When is this going to dawn on the pros? When they give guidance warnings soon? I can’t wait for the carnage, oh the humanity lol!"

"Nike and Kap thank the very “patriotic”, flag waving, anthem singing, Bible thumping MAGA dolts for staying away from Nike products and stock. God wants you to keep up the protest.

I have little doubt that the ""never Nike"" ilk will help move NKE even higher to $110 and possible $120 long term where we may see year another 2:1 split ... and suddenly the stock will be $60 again (and savvy investors will have TWICE as many shares)NIKE ... the long term money train.Back up the truck .... beep, Beep, BEEP ... thank you ""never Nike"" buffoons."

Went short today at 80.52. Anyone else? This is so obvious. I look for Nike to drop at least 5 points this week. The only negative is if they reverse this ludicrous marketing move
So cute how people think Nike will hold up in the 90's. I've got news for you everyone. It won't last.

Algorithms selling the downward momentum today. NKE will be back next week. Longer term investors like myself are still up over 50% on NKE over the last 2 years. Stay long & strong. NKE is headed to 100. Check out any of my previous NKE posts. Avoid the haters. One must wonder why they come in here every day to bash the stock. NKE is one of the few longterm sure winners in this market. Any price under $80 is another buying opportunity.
buh bye ..!!!!! DOWN SHE GOES!
Maybe Nike can put the Chinese flag on their sneakers. Kaepernick would probably be fine with that.
When will the panic set in around $75.00
Take your profits and run. Tomorrow is a down day again. Nike is worth $50-60 in this market.

"Good morning all. I don't know how many of you read your Bible, but a chapter that really spoke to me last night was Psalm 109. It's a prayer from King David. As odd as this sounds, I said that same prayer in regards to my Put position in Nike. It's very inspirational and a very recommended read. I suddenly feel very great leaving this to the Man Upstairs and letting Him have His way with Nike."

"Considering MAGA people represent a small fraction of Nike’s base, this is a smart move to take back market share from Under Armour.

LeBron James men’s shoes start at $130) and they buy every new shoe their favorite athlete pushes out to market."

Then again it didn't come free to me. I earned what I have unlike the little boy wearing pads. Pretty soon Nike will need to borrow some pads from their over paid whiner that never earned anything as it was given to the spoiled brat.
Sink. Sink. To the bottom.
"Since the Dennison-called boycott of Nike, the stock has increased due to rising sales as Dennison-worshipers rush to buy Nike merchandise to burn in defiance.Ironically, were the Dennison-worshipers to use their Socialist Dennison Administration COVFEFE-45 welfare checks to buy merchandise from the Trump Store, their purchases would be shipped via the USPS.Bigly.

"If you wear Nike (and Converse) symbols, you promote foreign labor, sweatshop abuse, and hatred of America. The low-info left is getting played once again to support evil globalists. Buy American. Hire American. Take the time to find products specifically USA Made and pay for quality and honest Americans. Pray they can see what they have before it slips away. America first."

Where are those earnings?
"Nike is a communist organization controlled completely by the Peoples Republic of China. Though they are not committing treason, they should be declared an enemy of the state; the board of directors should be brought up on charges of unfair labor practices and child labor, and collaboration with enemy spies."

"Sell sell sell, short short short, make money while bringing the company to its knees so they can look eye to eye with their anti American hero kapernick"
"This is what happens to companies that alienate half of their customer base through corporate activism. The loss in revenue and earnings doesn't show up right away, but results in a gradual drop over time. Many like myself tell people that if I'm wearing Nike apparel it is at least two or three years old, because that is when many stopped buying Nike. #$%$ and other athletic retailers are now stocking much more of their stores with Under Armor and Adidas gear now as a result. Of course Nike had the initial pop with those that sympathized with their causes, but now the impact of the loss of a large chunk of their customer base is starting to show up in financial results. The best days of Nike are behind them."
The 2 faces of Nike are disgusting at best. I will shop nowhere that Nike is. Nike is now a Race Baitor. Making it a Black Entitlementment Company. Kaepernick and Williams show us all how they believe they are entitled to have special treatment and be allowed to disrespect every ethnic group because of their Black Entitlement Belief. The Nike Statement is a joke coming from Karpernick as he suggested of sacrificing everything. That in itself is a complete lie from jump street Nike Style!
LOL.......Stormy and Avenatti were supposed to get him. Then Cohen was going to bring him down.Now Mueller has failed too. Who's the next scapegoat??
Dropping to 140 in the morning. Same story everyday
"Far more people are upset at Nike at this than political and age lines i’m finding. I’m hearing from young and old, white, asian, black, mexican, male, female, democrat and republican, this was anti-American, anti-law and order. None of these people will ever do business with Nike again. There has to be major pain coming nike’s way, no question."

Red and Back under the Pre Earnings Close again.The Party is over.Its the Kraepernik Curse.
Maybe Jermaine Whitehead and Kaepernick can do Nike commercial together. Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. LOL
"Nike couldn't have endorsed an anarchist at a better time! Not only tdo they have to deal with a downturn in the market thet have to dral with the backlash as well! Also, earnings will not help matters! OUCH"

He's a cancer for any team and that should be obvious to all at this point. That's why he's not signed anywhere to play football !The most pathetic part about all this is watching the Woke crowd totally ignore Nike's child labor practices and the fact they've been sued for pay discrimination against women and have spent millions settling racial discrimination lawsuits.Why, it is almost as if the Woke crowd has no principles, or something. Why dont these ""STARS"" go to where the REAL problems are if they want to help so bad?!?! Because Its easier to claim inequality and racism than preach to inner city youth on the values of life and respect the law rather than break it. Become mediocre + Claim racism + Claim collusion = $Profit$"

NKE will drop another 4% during conference call. It can grow only so much. They gave highest expectation last time.
Nike sales jumped and their stock did not plummet and yet the haters are still pouring in lol... some folks should take a marketing class or two.

This just backfired on Nike. Went to the mall today. People were there as always. Nike shop with less traffic tho than normal
You can short this for trade all day. It might be higher for tomorrow's open seeing its in all time high area.
Q3 EBIT street consensus declined 21% after yesterday's call. the stock had a 25% run into the print. numbers came down 21% yet shares are off modestly. this should be in the lmid 50s today but in this mkt bad news is good news.
Supporting Nike. Is same as turning your back on national anthem and all it stands for.
Run those Krapernick ads again so NKE can get down into the single digits!

"Kraper originally said “I will not stand for the flag of a country that sends soldiers around the world killing people”You probably can’t find this on google But I bet there are tapes and videos of his original comment around, but no liberal rag will ever show it"
"using such a negative person to represent your product is going to affect all your loyal shareholders. he is someone who should consider leaving the country.his prejudice for something he has never experienced is going to be a disaster. I know I am only one person, but I will never buy or invest anything that NIKE has to offer again.i am 72 years old and I have never known anyone with a slave. and if NIKE believes this country supports prejudice I would like them to tell me about it.It would serve better to support those who protected this country, rather than someone who believes we as average americans are racist."
Looks like that SLAVE LABOR is paying off.

Too bad I needed a pair of new Adidas or some other non-Nike brand to celebrate labor day. But it's good news the Boycott Nike for Life movement is catching on. Stop divisive racism. End Nike.

A lot of people using the Nike app to buy new drops and resell on StockX. They have new drops every day that sell out in minutes. The resell value of some of these sneakers are insane!! Sneakers that are $200 reselling for $600. I think this has a lot to do with their online initiative. StockX helped them greatly to accomplish this.

NKE Stock will always do well. That does not mean the company is ok. They spit on the country they originate in. They exploit workers around the world. They hype their overrated products to families that can’t afford it. It is ironic that many people on this page defend Nike as if they were some kind of family member. The defenders are mostly people that support Bernie or some other socialist loser. Nike is the poster child for evil capitalism. Why do you defend this company?

Due Process prevails. Congrats Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh . Socialism not gonna happen. Republicans vote midterms. Keep crazyDems/Socialist our of power forever.
The big driver here is sales in China. China is on fire; their factory output is incredible and that means their consumers are buying. They are likely to pre-announce those numbers before their earnings report.

how is nike not 200 already? with blowout sales numbers this is so undervalued at these levels.
Nike - a very forward looking company.Taking on Trump was GENIUS!
"The market took a hit last year to losses it hadn't seen since the Great Depression and this year won't get any better now that the economy will take a hit from the losing trade war, huge deficit, and $12 lost during a failed shutdown.The Dotard is taking America into a recession."
Want to know how Nike did it? They fired so many people who lived and breathed Nike. They were employees who spent years in the company believing in the culture only to be fired the first moment possible to prop up earnings for wall st. I know because my gf works in corporate barley held onto her job in the last cuts. Too essential. Watch out
Nike deserves to go down picking Kaepernick to represent them!
Don't forget..... Progressives have also ruined this message board for Nike. It will forever be a political board from now on.

I watched on the news that NIKE uses slave labor and child labor in China to make its shoes. this is a shame that these people have to be slaves to a large company like Nike. I demand for a stop to this immediately or things will go south for Nike. this will be in the way of getting large groups of FREE people to stop buying your inferior shoes where even the SOULS have left on many occasions.
52 WEEK HIGH COMING
"Looks like Nike got that ""snap back."""
Sell this and buy Tesla
First thing i would do is fire Kaeperdix for cost cutting measures.

Liberals don’t need guns to shoot themselves in the foot. Lol it’s amazing!
Nike sure knows how to pick 'em! Nike supports spoiled brats over American values? Stand up for America! No Nike.
"Way overpriced, just like their products. Ad campaign with a troublemaking freak wont help"
"With nikes two major deals, the MLB and Liverpool becoming the official uniform suppliers, sales will go up. Of course there are other factors to consider but overall I’d say Nike will be a stock that will gradually continue to increase by the end of this year. Innovation is key for this brand."
About to top of list of 'Most stolen brands'.
This will go down as one of the biggest mistakes of ad campaigns of all time. Hard to believe an icon company like Nike can spend tons of money to come up with a disaster to slit their own throats
"Owebamma vowed to ""fundamentally change America""He succeeded."
OPRAH SHOULD STICK TO WEIGHT WATCHERS COMMERCIALS AND ACTUALLY TRY TO FOLLOW THE DIET PLAN ROFLMAO
"Rally to PT avg of $162. Maybe overextends to as high as $168 when the market rallies into the close of the week. Ex dividend rush - March 1st.Ride calls higher, and I’m getting puts and selling calls at $162-$164"

"4 days later, with the Dow down another 1,068 points, the market’s up only 10% under Trump, vs 45% up at this point under Obama. -------December’s drop is now worse than in December 1931. And 2018 is not just the worst since 2008 but the 3rd worst in the lifetimes of most Americans."
What do you call a NKE bag holder? S___ah!
I just bought my 8 sons new NIKE shoes!!!My new name is Keven. I got shoes for moose and squirrel too!
Ultimately we find out how this plays out in shoe and apparel sales. Should know in the next quarter or two. NKE is to risky for me at this price. I also don't approve of their marketing ploy.
"Good stock to short now that they are the face of the Black Lives Matter Protests, just follow the saga of the University of Missouri, they can't get kids to go there now and have entire dorms sitting empty.

Nike is set to soar tonight and tomorrow and friday
Just say No to Nike Slavery#FreeTheUyghurs
"Excellent quarter for Nike, congrats longs. Bought this at $52 two years ago was one of the easiest bets I’ve ever made, no brainer. I’m holding on for a while longer and hoping we’ll get a 2 for 1 split, then some more price appreciation. China sales look great at +20%"
Another MOMO stock....flat earnings and rev growth for years...yet continually new all time highs. Another multiple expansion stock...Forward PE= 30+...lol
Wouldn’t touch Nike stock with 10ft pole. They just made a bad move. I still believe in my country and would never turn my back on it or my father who served for it. Shame on them!
$70-74 end of week. $128 billion cap with bad margins is a bubble waiting to pop. Gutted in half after 1 year once it sinks in that the brand is for losers. Nike has been a bad company for a long time. Real Americans are finally seeing it up close.
"WASHINGTON (CNN)President Donald Trump's approval rating has fallen 6 points in the last month and stands at a new low among political independents, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.Overall, just 36% approve of the way the President is handling his job, down from 42% in August. Among independents, the drop has been sharper, from 47% approval last month to 31% now. That's 4 points below his previous 2018 low of 35% approval among political independents in CNN polling, and 1 point below his previous all-time low among independents in CNN polling, reached in November 2017."

"“Texas is big and so will be the turnout for our MAGA rally in Houston, Texas Monday,” said Michael Glassner, Chief Operating Officer of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. “That’s why we’ve organized the Donald Trump- Big Texas Tailgater outside the Toyota Center. We’ll have great food, live music, big screens, and a great time for all of our guests. Inside and out, the excitement at this Trump rally will be as big as Texas – it’s going to be epic,” he concluded. The crowd size bodes well for Republicans' chances in the midterms, now just 15 days away. Trump's approval numbers have also shot up. He is at 47 percent, according to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. That's higher than President Obama's rating ahead of the 2010 midterms, The Hill notes. ""Morning Joe"" anchor Mika Brzezinski admitted that the momentum is on Trump's side"

Those Margins are TERRIBLE.Sure sign of DOWNTURN for NIKE.
"Well, my $65 Puts look good into tomorrow....will probably cash out until year end, then re-think. This market is too strong even for an overbought stock like this!!"

It was fairly crowded and a nice day weather wise. I think people just want to get out. Seems like most were wearing their mask."

I kinda miss the Turnip and his boycott calls for certain companies. Its calls for boycotts were great contrary indicators. Witness the Mango Mussolini's call for the boycott of Nike a couple years back. That sure worked. I would like to sincerely than David Dennison and John Barron for the tens of thousands of dollars that I made from NKE buying at the boycott low.MAGA - Melania's Awkward Gynecological Appointments
"Titans, Vikings suspend in-person activities after Titans' 8 positive COVID-19 tests“On Tuesday morning, the Titans COVID testing results returned three new player positives and five new personnel positives.

"Nike dominates the college athletic wear at the bookstores. Many are not aware but the licensing rights for major colleges is huge, hundred of millions as alumni and students buy jerseys etc for Bama, USC, UCLA etc. When you start seeing the colleges start cancelling Nike licensing rights to mfg. and produce their own athletic wear the heady days of Nike are over. It will start happening shortly at a major level and has already begun. Some of the major colleges who have already decided cutting the middleman out, Nike, was in their benefit.When the NFL follows suit, and it will, Nike stock will be trading in the high teens. Near term, probably a few weeks it will be in the fifties but long term, colleges and soon professional sports cutting out the middleman will devistate Nike. As I said, this has already begun at the college level. And there is always the kaperwack effect to amplify things. Take a knee."
Nike moving exactly how it has been all year. Look at the chart those that know how to read one. The ad neither boosted or hurt the stock.

Why??? in any sane reason? would CEO and Board put stock holders and Investors in Such Harms way?? Finanicial $$ Risk? FOR what possible gain...

Months and quarters later they will be reporting softening sales and decreased market share but other apperal company will be reporting increase better sales and market share..Easy to do stupid when all the board members and CEO are millionaires...I never buy again..
Colin Kaepernick? Are you KIDDING me? Stopping purchase of ALL Nike products until Nike fixes this. Why on EARTH would they hire someone who is SO vocal about his HATRED for our country?Does Nike hate the USA too?
Nuck Fike
"Do you see all those articles on damage control? ""Online sales spike"", ""160M of free promotion"". It's a bull trap that leaves out key data. Have a good laugh in Q1/Q2 2019 when reality catches up that Nike is for Losers. Anyone who thinks it's good to invest in globalists who promote hatred of America and hatred of truth (about crime) deserves to be a bag holder."
