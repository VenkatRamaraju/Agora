Gorgeous 6 month chart. $180 by end of the year!
McMoney cha ching!
MCD is a hold-forever one
"Will continue to hold. Unfortunately many restaurants will never re-open, fast food will continue strong. This is not what I want for these other restaurants and businesses. This will be one of the fastest to recover."
Covid heavy at McD and burger king.
"ONCE the EARNINGS CHASERS are done with the momo stocks, they will return to MCD, and continue to pocket the FREE MONEY from the quarterly dividend payout. "
Should outperform under socialism
"MCD is killing it with the quarter pounders, fries, and strawberry/chocolate shakes"
MCD is down 6.41% to 138.97
Apple looks too highstreaming will help thoughbut the PE is high relative to the growth rate and its at a 52 week highup too much in one year for its size
Should go over ATH today. 230
"Have you seen MCD's menu since the pandemic started? It's a piece of $h|+. Nothing but fried, fried, fried. Grilled chicken - GONE. Grilled wraps - GONE. Breakfast during the day - GONE. A big part of the problem has nothing to do with MCD - it's lazy people who would rather sit home and take $600 and not work. Short-sighted, but the reality right now. Take away the $600 and watch how many people go to MCD for a job. But MCD is really backed into a corner, and let's face it, $8 + for a quarter pounder, fries and a drink? I'd rather go to CMD and have a much better quality meal for $9 and change (includes a drink). And if you load a bowl correctly you can SPLIT it with another person, so it's CHEAPER and BETTER QUALITY. MCD is toast."

A bunch of fear mongers on CNBC trying to drive the price down to rid of Trump. Bringing the con man ackman on to lower stocks then rerunning it every hour. The panicky lil girl is a known shorter of stocks and they let him speak like he’s an expert on viruses.
178 to 160. where can investers find sell points
Zero rates ... I will eat my cheeseburgers and clip 2.50% all day
There's no support for this till 194. I am prepared to dip a toe in at 200 and add if it dips further.
MCD reached an all time high at 197.91
Wendys is such a better buy than mcd
I'm looking forward to that guaranteed dividend!
i can’t believe people actually eat this junk. with that being said good luck longs
Why does everyone think there is limited China exposure here? My McDonalds once had Szechuan sauce for McNuggets.
MCD now has one of the unhealthiest menus in the QSR segment. There is not ONE grilled chicken item on their menu. All they have are burgers or fried items like fries or fish or chicken. The lawyers are going to have a field day with this menu.
"MCD actually climbed after EX Div. date and suddenly to day started to dive on high volume, but what happened?"
"We need new buyers. MCD is so close to new 52 week high. If tomorrow is another rally day, it should be able to make new 52 week high."
McDonalds mastered the minimum wage increase. I see less poeple at the counter and more food on the move. Tech savy and younger customer are ordering more food on the apps. What a story...they transformed a behemoth company less than 2 year. Management deserves an atta-boy. I'm buying on any weakness.
"how safe is mcd's dividendHmmmmmwhat about how does the dividend compare to the 10 year treasurywell, see my other posts, it puts mcd worth $147 per sharehow about the price to sales ratio at 6.7 compared to SBUX down around 3"
Wagering it’s in the red at closing.
Good job McDonald’s. Supporting first responders will give you a lot of goodwill. I know I will always be a loyal customer for life!
MCD BS ALL SMOKE AND MIRROW
Impressive interview on CNBC with ceo ...it’s a tech company
"campaign poll numbers are stupid lies, with tiny groups of voters"
I don’t think this stock will be going up in the next 10 years
"Actually this is the best news for McDonalds. If they were doing well and this happened, then I'd be worried. But this is the spark the stock needed."
"From 15 bucks to 208??You can't cry about that, unless you sold at 15...."
sellput in stopsdon't hold it without stopswait for a really major pullback to the 52 week low or so
COME ON BUY...WE NEED BUYERS.....
"So I might have done ok today, bought in @ 124.60 almost the low"
EX dividend date coming up end of month. Just saying....
@ Miss Lovely - obviously you work for someone who has their own agenda here . You aren't a McD investor ( and haven't been ) at anytime.
earnings matterswithout lookign at earningsif the 10 year goes to 3%mcd is worth $159based on the dividend ratio and present price
"you've hear of trash daytomorrows crash daygenerally how it worksabsurd target, BOTs take it up, though its already 5 times too high, value $117 I believenext day and later, sells offtime to revisit 700 at least"
"Is there a wall at 235,92 !???? LOLThey dont let it go................... :-("

Buy back in the afternoon when It's cheaper!!!!
"Someone is buying MCD one share at a time @ $168.96. About 45 trades. After a 4,300 share block executed at $168.28. Some mutual fund are carefully executing a plan to lift up MCD share price back to $168.96. They are buying a share at a time. Probably one mutual fund sold to another mutual fund. Both have a lot of MCD shares."
$MCD coffee and service better than $SBUX and comparable to $DNKN
MCD not too bad lately
"CNBC ""OPTIONS ACTION"" today.....segment on MCD is set to break down 5-%....all panelists agreed that it is a sell, or short and offered and option stratetgy selling the Dec. $145 PUTS to fund buying the Dec. $155 PUTS.....MCD looks like it WILL break the 50 day average.....and should crater after that."
Only good thing about this garbage stock is the dividend! No value whatsoever
earnings up $400 M since 2014liabilities up $16 B
I guess I won't be going to McDonald's anymore .... I don't where Masks.
"In this sliding phase should we consider the volume, too? So far about 20 M traded out of 800 M."
Technical data at 9trading are showing great signs of upside potential. Target: 203.18.
"I don't feel sorry for employees that get laid off Mcdonald's . They don't give good service at drive thrus and they never give anything extra unless you ask for it. If I order fries , I shouldn't have to ask for ketchup or napkins ."
"Sonic guides lower as consumers cut back...Sonic – The restaurant chain beat estimates by two cents a share, with quarterly profit of 43 cents per share. Revenue missed forecasts, however, and Sonic also issued lower-than-expected guidance."
whats going on?
Only north of $160 Billion.Should be up to $165 Billion.Great products. $1.00 any size drinks. Should make the milks $1.00
What just happened that MCD dropping over $5.00 per share???
"Is miss lovely a "" bot ""??"
#FakeFood
wow! mcdonalds is packed today. I am longving it!!!! dividends soon also!
Lower Rev's and Lower Earnings on Fewer Shares. Add in McD's inflation and you have less product being sold. The globe is still in contraction.There will be no safe haven if the Free Market Economy is not restored.
Dang I wish I would’ve waited and bought later down the road instead of Friday. This is going to be brutal. Markets (all sectors) will be DESTROYED tomorrow and probably the entire week. We need some GREAT news on this stupid over blown virus. The MSM is blowing it up like it’s the Black Death. It’s barely worse than the flu and of course more contagious but not EVEN CLISE to what we are being told.
there was no newsall of a sudden it goes up a tremendous amountbuilding shortstake a look at the moving averagesWall Street games144.82 was the 52 week low
buying more tomorrow. below 160 is free money
Does MCD usually drop going into earnings? Asking for a friend
MCD packed in my travels last 3 weeks in Southwest USA. They are ordering something in there.
"Even BOGO free happy meal isn't worth $4.Eat MCD and watch your family get fat and have heart problems.If they would just make something healthy, but ""Mc"" means fat salt grease fast and friendly"
$MCD I can’t keep the women off me when I buy them McChickens.
Coke products just give me one more reason not to eat at McDs.That said with all the anti white #$%$ in the last 4 years can you really trust eating at a McDs or any other restaurant ?If these workers will screw with a cops food think of what they'll do to yours.
"Britain, customers formed long queues in their cars, snaking around corners as they waited to get a last Big Mac from McDonald's drive-thrus before closings on Monday.People shared pictures of their last McDonald’s meals on Twitter, with one user in Glasgow saying she had sworn to eat healthier but “decided to have one last one for a while.” Her picture show a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, fries and a drink.Oh yeah, get time to buy today...up 15%, not yesterday...today is better lol."
What’s that SMELL? Shorts burning
Im out i made 18% :)
"McDonald's Corp. MCD, -0.10% shares were up 2% in Tuesday premarket trading after the fast-food giant reported third-quarter earnings and same-store sales that beat expectations. Net income totaled $1.64 billion, or $2.10 per share, compared with net income of $1.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, year-over-year. Sales for the quarter totaled $5.37 billion, down from $5.75 billion last year. McDonald's attributed the revenue decline to the company's refranchising initiative. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.99 and sales of $5.30 billion. Global same-store sales increased 4.2%, while same-store sales increased 2.4% in the U.S. The FactSet global same-store sales guidance was for 3.6% growth, and for the U.S., the growth guidance was 2.4%. McDonald's attributed the U.S. same-store sales increase to a higher average check, the result of price increases and menu mix. McDonald's shares are down 3.2% for the year to date, but up 2% for the last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.45% is up nearly 9% for the past 12 months."
i haven't gone to MCD for five years. Overpriced #$%$ even before COVID.
160 MORE MCD customers sickened from salads...on nightly news now.
"WTRH is becoming the best pandemic stock. Bars and restaurants are ordered to close again due to outbreaks.

WTRH will help these restaurants to deliver food. $DENN $SBUX $DRI $CAKE $MCD $RRGB $DNKN"
"YOU CAN TELL WHEN A COMPANY IS BUYING BACK THEIR STOCK....ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WHEN IT WON'T BUDGE DOWN, YET NEAR ALL-TIME HIGH IN A MARKET ROLLING OVER."
"Breakfast chicken announcement has me concerned, because it seems a stockgap as new chicken product must not be testing too well, and competitors with breakfast chicken are becoming a problem. We will see."
Tried to use the bathroom at my local MCD. I think they use poop to clean it. Anyone ever work there who can confirm or deny that?
How could Americans realize this is junk food?
I am amazed by the performance of McDonalds.
"who woulda thought I'd have over a double in the venerable Dow30 stalwart MCD, not counting divs, in <4 years? That's an Average gain of >18% annually! Just goes to show, you can't beat the originator and master of fast-food. With the best real-estate worldwide, and decades of increasing dividends... it's a keeper!"
Mueller Witch Hut On Russian Collusion is still a big nothing Burger 
Who really wants to eat their. Now my Sister was an exception but she passed away. Hum
What a trash this turnout to be
insane market
Buying this all the way down
Reason for dip is JP Morgan cautions on US same store sales growth. Buying opportunity. Long MCD.
"They better not give this trash stock bail out money, they wasted billions on buybacks .. Make the executives give back the money they made pumping and dumping this overblown buyback trash whale !"

Am an old fart who bought MCD many many years ago. Recently elected dividend payout to buy toys and travel. MCD is as steady and solid a company as they come. I read the aggregate real estate holdings have appreciated greatly and are now worth a bunch... that’s good for the MCD stock price.
I had McDs at $159 and panicked and sold. Should I buy again at current price?
McDonald's is down 11.93% to 156.00
MCD better hurry up and start selling BYND stuff
MCD is $2 higher this morning. So the market think $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu is a good idea. It looks to me they copy the idea from Denny's.
"Just sold my stock, what idiots they are for alienating 1/2 the country..... good riddance, made a few bucks though"
New format sucks
That was not a good report at all. I should have sold before the close yesterday. Slowing sales and it's only going to get worst. I think we go to $110 before next qtr. We shall see. I will buy more just under $112
@Anonymous Are you on crack?
Vegans love MCD so much that they're trying to put something on the menu that's for them. And this consumer base has proven to pay the premium if it points to better health.
Today is your chance to cover..take your profits and wait for another entry..this could be up $3 tomorrow
"In the short term you may lose, but long term you will never lose. Solid fundamentals, high yields, it will be bought back some times soon. Next deal will be Pokemon Stop with Niantic then will generate more revenue, more sales. Take a look at long term VIEW!"
MCD will open inside the White House if Trump is re-elected..!
"went to pizza hut at dinner time2 people were there besides myselfmyself and someon else got the $8 pizza online2 people working thereRed Lobster was busytoo expensive though, lobster is $32 a pound, but it cost that much in grocery stores"
"Thinking about MCD's team up with AARP? Not me. I am remain positive, both technical and fundamental. In retirement myself, I prefer the Mac Breakfast, over the other menu items. Senior coffee is also great. It helps to know the taste of your investments' coffee, when possible."
PLEASE JUST BUY BUY BUY...YELLEN WILL FIX EVERTHING ....RUN THIS MARKET UP NEVER SELL....BUY BUY
"Great buy this morning ! Takeout, pickup, drive-thru and delivery ALL open and surging. With the COVID out there drive thru's will be packed."
Anything under $210 I will pound the table
"what happened today was threefold first the dividend date was yesterday for record so people sell the day after second the bad news with the tariffs third RBC downgraded it to $170 from 190, which means this has a 15% upside this year. that's really not bad news if you think about it at this point. do you think Buffett would sell his stock if he owned McDonald's today, definitely not."
"Time to short this PIG, overvalued stock again....they will crash after this earnings report.....revenues keep declining.....they will NOT be able to prop up with share repurchase and cost cutting forever!"
I don't like how the stock closed at the low today.
Missed the high by .92 cents.
"The country sinks into a depression while Americans wait at home for selfish, unpatriotic companies like McDonalds to shut down. Untested people should not be making other people's food!!! ""Leaders"" continues to let this pandemic grow worse by not shutting down companies putting Americans at risk. Sad sad times!"
"Open the restaurants, Covid death rate only 1/2%."
"MARGIN SELLING TOMORROW...see you at $135!!!!!!!Up every week since 1/1/17.....only a moron would buy this here!!! Heck, almost EVERY target price by every analyst is BELOW where it is now!!! Just a low VIX and computers chasing....when it breaks it will be violent and swift!!!!!!!! Also, MACD line ready to cross to the downside!!!!!"
Should go down in the afternoon like it always does
IMF just downgraded Germanynot good for MCD
This is the cheapest stock in the restaurant industry and the very best; good food at reasonable prices and all the restaurants are very busy; the new beef is great and selling quickly
"For those in the restaurant space willing to take a little risk, check out BFI (Burger Fi), a rapidly growing burger chain in Florida and Saudi Arabia. Great reviews, they handled COVID well (kept revenues flat) by expanding to delivery and more takeout, and are poised for growth (see their press releases). No dividend however. But a multi year play on a well run restaurant company.$BFI $DRI $EAT $SBUX $MCD $WEN $CMG"
"This guy Joey keeps saying it’s gunna drop but we end green every time, with all these upgrades I expect to be at 220 very soon"

"insidershaving mcd borrow money to buyback shares, while they sell shares"
My advanced Modigliani analysis is still showing 265. Shorts need to be cautioned
As the markets of foreign countries collapse funds will flow into our markets and MCD will be a major beneficiary because they are well known Worldwide. Obviously that has already started and this slight pullback is only temporary. JMHO
what happened?
"If $195 doesn't hold, it could test $189."
WITH A PE AROUND 10 THE STOCK IS WORTH ABOUT $60.

"From TA perspectives, there is a gap jumping from $149 to $156 nine months ago. Now it is reversed. We will see flash crash on MCD from $156 to $149 very fast. It is the reason why some people willing to sell at $153.09 in pre-market."

Wendy's has much tastier breakfast. MCD share price is not even worth $120.
Good time to buy. They had just short of 5% growth in sales and invested in tech revamp at the point of sale. This will make better than 5% soon.

McDonald's has the cleanest bath-rooms in the country. U can eat off the porcelain bowls in the Johns. That's why McDonald's is the best quick-service restaurant in the country.
"I got a Buy One Get One coupon so I went to McDonald's this morning. At 8:30, I am the only customer buying beside two sat and ate their breakfast. When they just had breakfast all day, it is easy to have one hundred people inside at any hour. This quarter they will have the worst earnings ever because all day breakfast kill their business. Now people are tried of their breakfast."
"Trumps tweets brings market down again! Mcd stock took a real beating today and I am wondering why since they had good earnings. Must be waiting for fed chairman to lower rates, can’t think of any good reason for it going down so far today..any guesses?"

Great buying opportunity at $211.75. I just put my money where my mouth is.
McD is Top Dog. Best burgers in the USA - no question. Also cleanest bathrooms of any franchised restaurant in the country. Do your business there. Also one of the best Corporations in the world. I like the dividend and I'm in for the long haul.
Overbought now...210 coming soon
They sold out of the Pokemon happy meals in my city already
"Have been a long time MCD holders. Like the stock, but current PE and PEG are too high for me to add more positions."
"look at how much they spend doing buybacksand how much they spend on dividendsits propped up like the US economyUS economy30 trillion GDPearnings 3 trillion or lessinterest on the debt $600 Binterest is 20% of the earningsthe military, not including veterans admin etc is also 20%duh"
"everyone will tel you its franchising and its goodbut look at the liabilities up $2B or so per year as wellThey do buybacks in a big way. I think that MCD is a lot weaker than Wall Street wants you to believeat some point, lower and lower revenues matters"
$2.58 div is very safe for this held forever
"Boomers, GenX, Millenials, Zoomers, everyone likes McDonalds. It is cultural heritage. There should be a national holiday named after this landmark company."
Pop and drops..no buying into earnings?
McDonald's picked a bad day to miss expectations because this is a risk on market. $MCD
I knew it would be a short time before MCD was >$200 again. Those lines wrapped around even during the worst of the virus..
How did it go down when earnings are good? It’s a crazy market.
I think I saw Mario Gabelli in a $MCD drive thru in Appleton this morning. What would he be doing here?
I owned McDonald’s for decades and hear gloom n doom from time to time. It’s a solid well run company that no one should count them out.
"Maybe this isn't the time to explain this but;Revenue's are down again (3)%Massive cost cutting still didn't help, but they did cut cost greatlyWhat people should be looking at is, MCD's dumped 6 million shares in this latest qtr., if you average it out at 140-145 as share that's 840-860 million dollars. Remove that from the qtr and you have a very large earning decline as well.The economy is still contracting across the board and the market keeps running up? When will it pop?"
"115 per share 2 years ago? seriously ?how fast us earnings growing, as fast as they can make it look with"
Does anyone think MCD is a good current buy for long term ? Wish I bought 6 months ago
Under $210 soon. Stick has been pumped up way too much. What worried me is how much better can it really get??
Expected to hit $190.00
Does anyone else think this weakness could be about selling defensive stocks to raise cash for investment in high growth now that some sort of trade deal has been reached?
Instead of long lines at the traditional counter there will be longer lines at the kiosk - makes perfect sense lol.
Reducing beverage prices is a stupid move. It won't increase traffic. Management must be concerned about sss. They are going to miss this quarter imo.

Any thoughts about the action on MCD today? It is down $3 below $182. I do not see news to drive it lower. Did we get a downgrade of MCD?

"The FACT is if you still work at McDonald's and you are WHITE the real truth is McDonald's just put your life in danger . Sorry if you get hurt but that is what is going to happen when companies become RACIST and Discriminate. Wake up and look around it's not just blacks and browns that are hurting . Obama and Joe destroyed every small town across America , FACT and there are angry young men on both sides just waiting to take action. If you are WHITE and still working at McDonalds you have just become the target of all the angry and McDonalds just told you they don't care what happens to you . FACT, I don't need to make stuff up because what I am saying is the truth all part of the real world we live in and it's not the fantasy world the DEM wits think we live in. FACT it is proven out everyday in the news."

"I?ve said it before... this company mgt is just awful! They need a new direction. This is low quality, hi-fat, fast food... not a good place to be going forward. As someone previously stated earlier today, the companies revenue have actually been declining over the last few years. People don?t want this #$%$ and they need to change direction quickly, there are so many other more healthy options than MCDs..."

This stock is a DUD!

Good company with declining revenue and earnings.
MCD's problem is that everybody else comes out with delicious and updated menu all the time while MCD stuck at 1980's and 1990's.

"I register displeasure at how the public and corporate America portray Ronald McDonald. As a fellow closet case, I enjoy the clown's bright red makeup and excessive use of blush portraying shame (when there really doesn't need to be any.).

I really can't stand bullies and people who make fun of him especially the folks at Burger King who recently kicked me out for using the bathroom one too many times. Robert P Cocco, Esq."

I love the breakfast oatmeals with the perfect touch of raisins. Of all these things, what I love most is the clown and his side piece grimace."

Myopic people worry about paying 9 dollars for a burger. But they don't see that at 11.58 an hour, millions of people would be paying taxes, instead of getting govt support.And your taxes going down.

"I am an ex-NASA engineer who worked on the COBE mission.If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.express.co.uk/…/Aliens-visiting-Earth-UFO-paul-…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a conference at the national Press club, where ex-military, NASA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead, Congress has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"

"Whatever changes are implemented to create wider appeal and acceptance, MCD remains nothing more than glorified junk food which over time is destined to be replaced by new enterprises offering a much higher quality product. MCD will try to re-invent itself until it simply rolls over and gives way to something that's new, better, healthier and doesn't fit into the category of junk food. The best days of MCD are behind it but it will continue to try to keep improving its image. Have a look at its advertising budget which, to me, suggests a subtle sort of desperation."

MCD earnings up an nice 42% since 2011. MCD stock up 300% since 2011 not including DIVS. Welcome to the long slow decline to bring this stock back to reality.

But look at all the tax savings you'll get, when millions of people will all of a sudden make more money, and not need help heating their home, or buying food., or making rent payments. Don't you see that raising the minimum wage would lower your taxes significantly ? Yeah, your cheeseburger would cost 25 cents more SO WHAT. Your stock might go down a dollar a share. SO WHAT.

Other fast food chains have many company owned stores, they will survive. McDonald's enjoy squeezing their franchisees in 2018, 2019 and let franchisees take all the risk. Now the payback time is due. I won't be surprised to see McDonald's take another loan because their franchisees have failed to pay the rents for months now."

Very commendable that the company is during former CEO fir lying and destroying evidence and misleading investigators about his conduct ..
They're selling every little pop !! it takes 30 minutes to go up 20cents and 10 seconds to go down 20cents.
"Strong start at opening , in the red by closing As usual."

There is something rotten inside MCD. Let the price come in more then buy. Dividend is becoming attractive again.
"I went by a Mcdonalds this morning at 7:00am. I live by one of the most successful Mcdonalds in the country. Zero cars in line. Why anyone thinks people are getting fast food is beyond me. I don't want to be served by anyone right now and judging by the cars in line, neither does anyone else."

"Burger King parent company said sales and earnings are down in the coming quarter. And they introduce $3 meal to attract customers come to Burger King. Do you think McDonald's will do much better than Burger King? Travis Scott meal was a hit. Because after absence of burger or bacon for six months, people will try it once. I was craving and drove to McD. But they sold out Travis Scott meal, then I just went to Burger King for a cheese bacon burger. But that is it. I don't want to risk my life again. Probably will eat one fast food burger every three or four months until there is a vaccine.And I have never been a fan of Big Mac. The sauce is like Thousand Island. So weird to use it on a hamburger. So McDonald's follow up promotional item should be a failure. And Travis Scott Meal's $6 price tag is reasonable. Unlike the last visit before Covid 19, I paid $9 for a bacon quarterpounder meal. I don't think the profit margin on TSM is good because of $3 discount to attract customers coming to the store. And most people won't come back after that promotion ends."

"MCD is worth $147 per share at mostthe recession should take it lower, the mountain of debt should take it lower, the beta should take it lowerbut the most it is worth is $147 per shareAlso, a PE suggest a 24% growth rate. Without the tax break, there would likely be NO growth. The debt ceiling date just passed. How much more debt will the US take on to ""spur the economy"". MCD borrowed $2B, $2B/$141 = .014 => 1.4% new debt. How much growth does 1.4% more debt in one year represent? Kind of like the positive GDP announced by the US government along with the $1 trillion new debt. The GDP is $31 trillion. $1T/$31T = .03, that is 3% of the GDP in new debt, thus - 3% GDP growth from the new borrowing. I think they said the GDP growth was 2.5%, not sure where that came from , but -3 +2.5 = -.5% ""GDP growth rate"", thats negative.this is the highest price you can come up with the PE is 24 and that's after they borrowed $15B more (taking the total debt to $31B) to do buybacksthe debt is up $2B in one yearthe interest on their debt I calculated at $1.26 billion per yearthings are getting dumb at MCDthe recession was coming and they knew it and doubled ther debttraffice fell3.2 billion dividends and 4.8 billion spent on buybacksborderline junk debt statusthe US dollar keeps getting diluted. Today is some date tied to the debt ceiling. As the dollar gets diluted, the US dollar safety net gets diuluted as well. If the dollar drops, stocks drop, as the dollar is tied to stock directly. Sooner or later it will happen."

"My local Starbux is clean and crowded. My local McDonald's is filthy and empty. Although another store near highway ramp is much cleaner, it still has very few customers when I dine there.

Otherwise, this brand will disappear in five years."

thanks for your ridiculous advice it shows how you have no idea of the danger of how much you can lose but you will learn the hard way my friend .This stock has just experienced what happens when the 770 million share float starts to exit all at once when it has been supported by under 4M per day.It is now playing catch up with the 22% gap opened up to the DOW since October .The end result is likely to be MCD's largest one day plunge in its history

"McDonald's giant debt load is weighing heavily on the balance sheet, bringing shareholders equity to a deficit of over $6.2 billion. With a little over $800 million in cash, the company most certainly cannot pay it off either."
"MCD is the Woolworth, GE, and Sears of fast food."
Great company but I’ll wait to add closer to the lows in the $120-125 area & 4% yield.
McDonald's is down 4.91% to 190.05
I love all the people that eat McDonald’s. Keep eating that fast food makes my pocket fat.
This is what McDonald's get when I order a large fry and they serve medium fries in a large cup. They steal . God giveth and God taketh away . Inaccurate scales is a detestable thing to the LORD. Proverbs.
Like I predicted no effect on the stock ; this is not chipotle; this is the premier food company and this stock will reach 200
"MCD is a bet on consumer discretionary. As the vaccine is distributed, expect people to adorn themselves with official badges claiming their immune and therefore, eligible to go to restaurants and resume life. In so doing, that will subdue the doubters and gradually this pandemic will become a thing of the past. I am using 90 delta LEAPS to trade this ticker."
"NOTHING in markets entertains me more than shorts, who were recently beating me, getting run over. NOTHING in markets is more satisfying."
Poor performance lately
"https://www.verdictfoodservice.com/news/mcdonalds-singapore-covid-19/It is all McDonald's fault.Singapore had only a few hundreds of cases in the first wave of Covid 19 hitting the island nation. So they reopened the restaurants including 35 McDonald's. Then on April 14th, one worker shown Covid 19 symptom. Because McDonald's rotated workers in 35 stores, they tested the workers in the six stores he worked recently. In the first test, they found three workers having Covid 19. In the second and third test in the next few days, the number increased to 5 and 7. Even Singapore is great on source tracing to contain the first wave, they are unable to contain the second wave. From 4/14 to 5/14, the infection cases have increased to 29,000 in the one short month. Singapore becomes the worst Asian nation hit by Covid 19. It is all started one McDonald's worker. I wonder if anyone in Singapore wants to sue McDonald's."

Do it right and the share price will take care of itself in a good way."
Nice dividend raise. Great compounder.
MCD worth $203.00
"Anyone know the particulars on the dividend and how it works for shareholders? What I mean is it paid out to everyone who holds shares through 11/30, or do you have to hold longer? I am long and intend to stay that way, but was just curious. Thanks and let's keep this sucker rolling"
"I was in a Mickey D's a few weeks ago buying my coffee, and the cashier was telling me that the store is attempting to have all ordering done through those touch screen kiosks. Don't know about you but that sounds like chaos to me, definitely a deterrent to those trying to get in and out. This is another opportunity much like ""self checkout"" that gets so far under my skin and causes me to want to shout out.. someone come ring me up because I don't work here! I refuse. Just the ramblings of someone who has had enough of being put to work at large stores."
"I posted this a while back the PE went up from this time.......article here in yahoo news mcd said they earned I think $1.76 after itemsthey earnings $1.72buyback was 4.4B which is 3.4% of the market capmultiply 1.72 x (1-.034) = $1.66$1.66 nowwas $1.47 a year agolooks like 13% real growthbut the PE is 26.And interest rates are going up and that will make it more difficult to for the debt which is $29.5Band labor is moving up to $15 slowly but surelytaxes helped them, but perhaps they pushed income into this year to get a better tax rate, I don't know that, though.accounting tricksfresh beef will help them, but cost more.

#mcd Price to book 149 debt per share $130 buffet buys at a PB of 1.50
stupid with brokers on line fixing commission at zero. All this to pump and dump stocks daily.I see massive daily swings here. Mcd at 208 a share is so stupid period. Whole stock market is so over priced period. This is the biggest pyramid scheme ever invented.
MCD is up 8.67% to 148.99
$2 drop!!!!! What's going on with this ?
"MCD is far more dangerous than AAPL here is why If MCD was valued on a price to sales similar to AAPL it would just $83 not $175On the same basis of AAPL's PE it would be $100Which stock would you buy ?the one with great design teams and billions in cash or a stock that has $40 debt for each share purchased ?That just shows that when the public is herded into buying MCD as a safe by some foolish analyststhe ""safe"" stock becomes so overvalued it is the one DOW stock that when the herd stampedes the stockcould be bottomless"

McDonald's HQ has deeper pocket. But eventually most of their restaurants will be closed like everyone else. The vaccine won't be out in 10 years like AIDS vaccine. It takes decades to make and the first patch is not safe even. People won't take vaccine for years. They will be administered only to soldiers.
who is selling at these silly prices? Major manipulation going on .............BUY BUY BUY.............................ENJOY THE WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I know that owning $MCD has made my portfolio quite fetching for young ladies all over town. I get so much action I can hardly find time to go get my Filet o Fish

"Fellow McDonald's shareholders should President Trump have US Justice Department arrest billionaire convicted felon George Soros for inciting riots and paying for thug who riot in major cities across the US.

"MCD many many years ago, at $42 if my memory serves me well, done very well long term."
Why is MCD dropping when the reports are looking good and they just announced that they are opening 1000 new stores???
MCD is a safe haven where the smart money goes to hide. Thats why its down on an up day. The fact that is up $30 in the last 5 months suggests the smart money knows we're headed for a recession.
"Well, we went up and closed green. Far from $6 up in premkt but ok for now. GL"
is there a SPLIT on the way?
Time for MCD to come up with a new menu. Getting tired of eating that grilled chicken sandwich for over a year.
MCD DIVIDENDS paid in good times and bad times. STAY LONG

Great buying opportunity

MCD in the toilet again
"McDonald's quarter pounder for $5.99Hyper-inflation, or a just a massive rip-off?Even when buy one get one free(?), it's waaaaaay overpriced.This is a boring, bland patty, not a Chef Ramsey burger!"
Going all fresh will drive price way up! It is coming soon.
The most optimistic evaluation i can make for McD is 180 USD. A new bubble is being created.
"Mcdonalds is garbage. Everytime I eat it, i get the runs. I dont know how people can eat that garbage all the time."

"Most items on $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu are gone. The only remaining items are coffee ($1 and $2), small fries and two cheeseburgers for $3. The $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu is a failure. Easterbrook has to go."
Why the big drop today over $3.00 ???
Distancing regular customers by cooking meatless hamburgers on the same grill as the meat burgers is a bad idea. There are people that used to be regular customers who will not go to Burger King for this reason. The trade off is not worth it. Please trade accordingly.
I am surprised by the miss but most global stores are walk in and probably hit profits most

"EVERYTHING GOING BAD FOR MCD. Hi Beef prices due to shortages, franchises unable to stay in business and requesting Corporate help, breakfast sales (a huge driver) are tanking, workers working while sick with Covid now! Expect 150s soon and fast if not 130s. This stock is falling faster than my cholesterol once I stopped eating there"
My new modigliani advanced technical analysis is indicating McDonald’s to 250 maybe 270
"guys this is now trading below its 200day, it's falling out of its trend line and not participating in the rally, to me this is a sign of a sell. if it doesn't go back up its 200day by close today, and doesn't look like it's gonna, I'm going to sell and take a loss."
This year McD surreptitiously increased prices on many Value Menu items by up to 20% and yet revenues are down 30% 2nd qtr! Drive thru can't be the sole sustainer. Results won't improve until covid is resolved.
experts are coming out.. cannot guess the timing of market drop .. yet still yapping about why the market keep going up
MCD will survive but sales will cut in half. THe damage will be there. .

"Officially MCD beat the estimate by 12 cents. But CNBC immediately pointed out this includes 7 cents by foreign currency exchange rate improvement, so CNBC said MCD beat by 5 cents. Then later in the conference call, someone found out McDonald's chose the lower than expected interest rate for Q1. The benefits for 8 cents. I am telling you the CEO is a snake oil salesman. He knows that McDonald's has to beat this quarter. He pulled all the stops to make it happen. But unofficially it missed by 3 cents."

Third quarter will beat estimates, McD's will introduce better, cheaper SBUX spanking espressos/lattes/capos,and pumpkin spice drinks. If timed right with the dividend hike announcement (I predict $1/share), we will see $170. Read and heed...and thank me later."

I think MCD eps/revenues surpassed Q4 especially no body cooks in holiday Oct-Dec holidays. Expect 300 in this Q. I will buy at the opening tomorrow"
220 after earnings...easy money
"I love CFA, but for morning routine, I think MCD pretty much mops everyone else up."

"Hey MCD leave Easterbrook alone. He clearly was ""driving"" employee satisfaction and the relationships were clearly consented mutually. You prudes are wasting shareholder money in an attempt to claw back money that is not yours. You gave it to him with a golden parachute and the board is just jealous they were not getting some. Bunch of $%#@ing morons!!"
"Fat Hilary Clinton, loves her daily 5 Quarter Pounders."
Uh on. MCD is up. Guess that means that the early market gains will turn red by the end of the day...We'll see if the mirror McDonald's theory holds up to empirical testing!

"Based on the Peter Lynch chart, the stock appears to be overvalued.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robert-olsteins-top-5-buys-172243995.html?.tsrc=fin-srch"
Why drop Cheeseburgers on the Happy Meal if they are adding to the profit of MCD. Let the customers decide as whether or not they want to eat healthy or not.
"Now I see the pattern. When the tech stocks take off, people use MCD as ATM to fund the risky asset purchases."

Total about 800 million shares; about 6 million traded - not even twice the average yet. So who is selling?
"Unreal that a research firm says sales are down and the stock sells off. Well, common sense tells me that any MCD in the hurricane area is going to be BUSY because any woman who has clean up to do after the hurricane is not going to be cooking. Someone in the family will run to MCD to pick up something quick and the mother/wife won't be cooking again until things are put straight around the house and yard. Unreal the sell off based on some research firm."

I had a colonoscopy and they found 34 $MCD French fries wedged in my colon. Do these things not break down in your gut?
Goldman Sachs Stock (GS) is tanking again today has dropped 10 points in the last 10 days and JP Morgan is also red todayWhat do these insiders know that you don't ?Is it the fact credit card revolving credit is dropping ?or the fact that house sales are slowing as mortgage rates increase ?or is it all the dept stores and malls closing resulting in less traffic to mcdonalds in the areas ?Or is it the largest auto loan default in history ?hmmmmmmm
Time to get greedy
Mcds taking advantage of Lent with the expensive 2/5 deal besides we are in the middle of a world pandemic. Thanks Mcds for your opportunist greed again!
"Ususally bad jobs numbers pushes MCD down, as it means less customers. They decided to push the price up though."
"mcd was trading like a high flyer last year, look at its growth last year it was like a fb or msft, now it's back to normal, if you think it'll take a couple weeks for it to go back to its old ways think again, the fact that it did not participate in the rally from the February selloff said a lot."

MCD is Just way overvalued- Small correction
Large fries matters!!! Ozsc !! 
cup and handle sending this to 230
I am considering purchasing some MCD stock. How does it hold up on a down market? The turd in chief is going to do some real damage.

I cannot believe California Pizza Kitchen file bankruptcy. The one near my home is always busy even at late hours.
"I added more MCD to my portfolio recently, great company."
"Got to love MCD DIVIDENDS. The stock may not run up and down like a lot of the popular momentum stocks, but investors can count on those quarterly payouts, whether market is good or bad. "
Ok this is getting stupid. How can bad news happen so frequently RIGHT AS I BUY!? Well I guess I'd better enjoy my dividends the next decade. What a joke.
Picked up Wendy's in late March....have almost tripled my money.
I always take my dates to MCD for filet of fish and get a sundae to top it off. Get lots of action when the sundaes are gone

McDonald's shares are trading higher after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a price target of $244 per share
This is going to 220 according to my extensive Modigliani analysis
Why not up??
"It seems to me the PE (though extremely high) is depressed by buybacks, which appear to be derived from debt. Seems like the stock is being manipulated in that sense by management and thus is not sustainable. The 52 week low is 156. Its up 42% in a year and is growing at les than 10%."
"Earnings miss, upheaval in the C-suite and high debt. Sell your shares so that I can buy them lower."
MCD is doing way to good to sell it . Hold.
Just a wild guess that they'll close at a record high of 193 today.
Wow down $4 pre-market. Buy it here.
Byron and team shook down GM. Not it's MCD's turn.
I am loving it !! 220 + 30 days !!

"Market up $483.00 and MCD down .50, what am I missing when sales are up, costs are OK, cutting labor costs with kiosk's and dividends about 3%???"
"Closed the office today at noon with a $MCD lunch. We had Filet o Fish, fries and pies for all. Some of our staffers put Chiracha on the Filet o Fish, was pretty good. I noticed two of our call center female staffers weren’t practicing social distancing when they left and jumped in the back of a Chevy Van. Might have to talk to HR. Maybe a hot shower will wash off the Wuhan."
Ha Ha! Look at the piece of garbage tank! My fresh new puts at $23.72 mark doing just fine!
"panic sellers gave a great chance to buy right before ex date, no way it's not going up before close"
Another undervalued stock. Going computer has slowed it down not speed it up.Worth $200.00 a share. Trading under $190.00 a share.Shareholders use your brains and get buying.
If we have martial law will they still bring back the Mc Rib?
"Just take a look https://mcdonaldscorporation.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mcdonalds-reports-second-quarter-2018-results 12% lower revenue, lower operating income 1%.

"Is it just me, or has McDonald's menu devolved into a collection of fried garbage? Where are the grilled chicken sandwiches? What about the grilled wraps? Salad, anyone? It's pure garbage now. I used to like this stock. Not any longer."
Im a bit surprised by the hit taken for a small miss and explained with much capital expenditures...think its a few funds taking profits and shorts trying to push the fear....lets hope for a hold here at 195-196..and better still a whiplash short busting move to 200
"Wow, cannot believe this stock is still dying while the market has been so green the past week."
piece of junk
"The charts are indicating that MCD is oversold now , RSI at 28. This solid be a bounce back week. Back to 200 under 210, but may be affected by BYND earnings report. We'll see, stay long on this one, it will go back up. The market loves enduring name brands."
McDonald's need a new dollar menu to combat Burger King's dollar menu. People want to $1 chicken sandwich and $1 hamburger.
Just bought a happy meal... Lets go McDonalds!!

"Market up, algo's sell MCD like clockwork."
"Took the entire office out for $MCD fish filets and cherry pies today. And coffee or their choice of tea. With the 2 for $5 it was economical and always tasty. One of our young execs said he likes to pop cherries and I fired him on the spot. None of that allowed at my company,"
two sausage egg mcmuffins and a coffee for $5.38 come on!!! this company is awesome!!!
"I purchased today at 188.7. I intend to scale in another 125% existing shares tomorrow at 10 am when the direction decides itself.I expect big institutional buyers ready to start scooping up. It was evident today in the price action if you ask me. That 188 level seems very elastic. I intend to buy below that the shares mentioned above if it goes there, or just load up at whatever the price @ 10 AM is."
Travis who? Lol MCD’s answers to a billion dollar lawsuit. Eat a chicken McMagot.
"Terrible close, sheesh"

"This qtr is fools gold. Lets look at the facts.This qtr was compared to a shut down qtr, what a joke, it means nothing.Compare this qtr to 2020 and 2019 and 2018 qtrs and you will see Rev. and Earning decline.The Mc'deal price has gone up some 35%+ since 2019, 2018, that means fewer customers, less product sold and that shows you contraction not growth.Nobody wants to work there except desperate people.A stock that has gone from $65's to $200's, you had better run fast. Institutions are stuck for the moment and you had better get out before they do."
"good stock to hold, cant go wrong...."
Beyond meat on McDonald’s Menu ??? Can someone in corporate office confirm this news????
Just picked up some more at $210.40. Thanks for the buying opportunity Piper.
This is one of the few stocks I am currently buying ; everything else is expensive but McDonald’s is still cheap
"Lordy, I'm now up almost 50% on MCD in 18 months, in price alone. That's not counting the divs, reinvested for another ~10%.Not too shabby, now the divs are part of my early retirement paycheck. Simple folks, if you keep it simple."
"Just returned from MCD/Senatobia,ms,employee asleep on bench seats(name-Ty).Front door for handicap locked at 5:15(open 5:00am). No manager around. Would never own this stock"
Wendy’s is a joke !
With MCD firing on all cylinders and earnings looking positive MCD just raised their dividend to $5.00 I sure would like to see this do a split so more young people can get into this really great company. The price at this level puts a large group of young people out of the picture with the per share above $200.00
JPM is shorting so they publish a caution - market manipulation. Long MCD. Always rises seasonally 4th qtr. Daily chart looks good.
Do not sell MCD at current price !!!!
Wisconsin $MCD should have perch sandwiches on Fridays. Would be awesome.

Take a look at what happen to Gillette when they went woke. Sales never recovered
MCD and NFLX are two companies that are well positioned to thrive in this pandemic. It's simply common sense. I'm looking forward to MCD's ER.

MCD will be down around $3-$4 per day until it bases out at $160.
Did they have good ER or not #$%$ is this
"Up scope.. just observing the restaurants, crowds, crisp screens, more ordering kiosks, counter layouts, and order efficiencies told me were were heading up. Best analysis, for the price of coffee and an egg-white McMuffin"
DOW just went from 100 to 44 in about 30 seconds
Just by selling fries and burgers MCD is way overvalued.Even Apple is lower than this.MCD going down big time.
Hit another all time high today.. ABCDEFG is starting a Go-Fund Me page to help him after so long as a perma-short...
".Ray Kroc founder of $MCD was asked in the beginning, how many McDonald's restaurants, he thinks he will have, He replied 1000, with a smile. However, he did not believe he will have that many. now look at how many Mcdonalds there is the world. Same analogy may apply to $SENS stay long and patient,"
I will buy this stock when it hits $120.
Just wait till the dividend Reinvestment hits.
"Here's the play MCD will climb back to low 220's prior to earnings, then when they beat it the shorts will have to eat, then will spike up to 228, resistance at 229"
"PE 27.5growth rate very lowtreasuries at 2%, so the dividend makes MCD look goodbut the debt is too high and the PE looks lower than it would by a whole lot if it were not for buybackswhere was it a year ago, what is the 52 week low, its being pumped, manipulated by the company itself and Wall Streetgive it time and it will correctbut now is pumping season, for now"

What if MCD purchased HMNY to play some movies inside like a micro theater for kids to bring in more moms and kids?
"Office had a McChicken eating contest at noon today, properly distanced. 20 employees at 123 sandwiches. $MCD staff were awesome. We had shakes to celebrate. Not a productive afternoon here."
Testing a automated drive thru when there ice cream machines barley work seems legit
When individual stocks have a huge run one must take some/little off the table. I've learned that lesson.
"Fast food drive-thru, the person orders in front of you has COVID-19, the virus can stay suspended in air, You come along and order, now you sucked in the virus."
$184.20 & still ging up
2pm daily nosedive..geesh
10% drop
Investors will take profits to cover losses in other stocks also....MCD is DOOMED from here....market $186.4 as the top!!!!!!!!!
revenue flat for 5 years 2013-2018 heavy borrowing to buy back 235 million shares 17% annual revenue ate up in interest costs due to this financial engineering a decline of 3% in stores closed....Im not lovin it!!!
Just bought a Big Mac for breakfast
"McDonald's hamburger sandwiches taste terrible. Full of sodium filled grease. Why do people buy them, because they're cheap? $2.99 for large fries? That's a rip off. I can buy a bag of potatoes for that."
What insanity buying mcds at 192.00 a share.This is why this whole system will collapse. Way out of whack here.
I also would like to see MCD split two for one or even three for one. Why did they give the CEO a raise that is now double last year salary??
"Stock could be headed to $180.00 Almost no one wants McDonalds cold, gross, food delivered 45 min to an hour after they pull it out of the grease. Vegi McPlant burgers are fried in beef fat on the same grill the Gut Punch Gross Burgers are fried.Don't think that is what health conscious vegetarians are looking for. #CluelessMcDonalds"
Any reason for huge options premium for next week? Is there some kind of event/news expected?
"even if you don't live near them, they somehow mess with you."
What a dog this is
Drive throughs and take out are all packed across the country. MCD will thrive....
"Successfull or not, WENDYS will steal breakfast market share. Just a fact"
No GOP official is going to get you breakfast at 5 AM. Or anytime for that matter.
McDonalds is putting profits ahead of their patriotic duty. Shut them down and maybe the C-virus will slow down. Any bets?
"Ba Da Ba Ba Bah, I'm Lovin' It!"
"McDonald's shares trading lower despite a clear fundamental news catalyst. Note shares broke above $200 technical level on Thursday of last week, rallied about 3 percent, and are trading back under the $205 level to near $200 again today."
52 week high $190.88 82 business days player it hots $190.85 then drops to current price.
This isn’t a buy in the dip market anymore it’s a trend down
I Don’t really see this going to 205.
"Dow Jones on fire. McDonald's share price continues it's downward spiral, actually DOWN during this mini-bull run. Was Bernie Madoff named COO when no one was looking?"
Get rid of the stores that are losing money.The stock would stay above $225.00 then.37 stores need to be closed and sold.

Long on MCD because I go there everyday for breakfast and it's always busy. Love the mobile app option and now they have delivery.
I was going to buy this stock yesterday but did not have the correct funds so I didn’t... I’m so glad. Have fun!
I'm at a loss. Why the pounding?
owned this back 2001. I'd be a zillionare
Mcd would be higher if they dump the worst 50 stores.
Headed to $225.00 on very good store numbers.
at some point the dollar takes as serious beating because of the excessive US debtand the interest rates move north substantiallyand MCD interest goes up up UPand the recession may be in place$150 52 week low seems to look high when you consider without buybacks they seem to earn 2 cents on the dollar'''''''''''''''''''check my numberscould be making mistakes

"A comment below here is totally mistaken and spewing false misinformation regarding its declining YOY revenues. MCD is transitioning to a 95% refranchised business model, by removing ownership of each business stake and taking franchisee royalties and fees as a major component of their revenue stream. This shaves off cost on their income statement, increases net income and free cash flow, at the expense of reducing revenue. McDonalds is more profitable than ever with this business model and continues to grow.I would be a buyer. And yes, it is safe to say it's worth more than 200."
"McDonald just put up a sign we hate White people and we are Racist against White people , We are going to discriminate against White people , WE do server White people and if we do we hate white people so much we are going to spit in your food."
MCD Will Introduce CARB FREE in 2020!
Boeing hasnt been too hurt and well lives were lost.....why would I think some CEO affair matters when it comes to sleezebag bankers...it will get a high five probably.
$7.00 to go !!!!
I went in Heavy in early December recognizing a decent cup and handle pattern and the security that I believe McDonald's offers + great dividend. I got completely out of the entire market Feb 27 because the latest pattern reflects further decline ... took a super small profit. I am watching and waiting this out... can't wait to buy back into MCD ..
I bought this stock exactly 1 year ago and I'm 8% down. I wish I'd bought index fund.Can't wait to sell it at break even price
All the 24hr McD's still have a homeless problem. The homeless are still using McD's to live and sleep in at night. The exposer to these deceases is huge. Wait until the law suits start.
"lol, this stock cracks me up."
Thanks market the one stock with drive-up windows all around the world with food people can enjoy and afford! They will take all the eat out business that others would have had as this is company and drive-thru that people have become comfortable going to. Valuation is reasonable with a good dividend.
no i wouldn’t feed this trash to my dog - lol @ FDA

"McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) Effective Interest Rate on Debt %: 3.18% (As of Sep. 2018) Effective interest rate on debt is the usage rate that a borrower actually pays on a debt. It is calculated as the positive value of Interest Expense divided by its average total debt. Total debt equals to Long-Term Debt & Capital Lease Obligation plus Current Portion of Long-Term Debt. McDonald's Corp's annualized positive value of Interest Expense for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2018 was $1,000 Mil. McDonald's Corp's average total debt for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2018 was $31,438 Mil. Therefore, McDonald's Corp's annualized effective interest rate on debt for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2018 was 3.18%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2.63% dividendso, they borrow money at 3.18% and buy back stocks with it to give out 2.63% dividend yield;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;to push up the share price to sell the shares, I guess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Look at how much long term debt they have!"
MCD is down 5.48% to 140.84

Nasty soybean and cricket flour is not ever going to be part of my diet. MCD can go mc#$%$ itself.
I agree with Barron’s; last global powerhouse and TARGET 190; buy it and never sell it for your children
"Bring back the monopoly campaign. Give customers an incentive. Everyone is a winner, from free food to 10 million dollars. Now is the time."
Everyone at the office is very high on the $MCD McChicken and Filet of Fish buffet we set up on Fridays. Coffee and orange juice too. Plus the pies. Cost effective and fun Friday bonding with the team. Get a lot of Mickey D’s for $500 a week.
PE of 24 for a hamburger biz?
"McDonald's Gives Me Dumps Like Hershey Chocolate SyrupIt's like my body is expelling stuff meant not to be absorbed into it. Gristle, intestines, rectums fried in some kind of oil, frozen, revitalized by microwaves, stuck between high sugared buns by someone that could be carrying HIV or Hep-C for all I know.."
#FakeFood. If the government didn't want to kill us a cheeseburger would cost $25.00 do the math on what it takes plus abuse etc.. Fund plants not the Animal Holocaust.

"If the minimum wage can't be raised to an inflation adjusted amount that it was in the 1970's, the Federal government, and the state governments should at least not collect any taxes from someone making minimum wage. The std deduction for all governments should be 15,000 (7.25 an hour). Sadly, many Penna communities also tax incomes as low as 12,000 a year, for LST taxes. These lawmakers are pure evil, keeping wages low, and taking away part that meager pay in taxes. If MCD lowered their franchise fee, it would greatly help."
"The fair price is $140 at best based on 10 year interest rate above 3%. MCD has very high debt to pay dividends. When the interest rate is low, it is OK to use long term debt to boost share price. But now it became a bad tactics. The CEO is too young to adapt a changing environment. You should avoid this stock."
Possible vegetable sandwich for MCD.MCD looking at poll numbers to see if Vegetable sandwiches should be on the menu.
This looks so bullish but I’ll see
I don?t get it why this is down with good ER #$%$
Never count this company out .
Wendy's is currently running free breakfast baconator promotion. Use Yahoo and Google search to see the details. You only need to buy another item. It is a good deal.
Looks like an easy return to $190.00
Down goes Frazier! The good news is that it will present a great buying opportunity for those of us who’ve been patiently waiting for a chance to buy in the 180s.
"buybacks push PE downlook at the PE, way way too high, and that's after the buybacks"

Another wave of selling next week
Jim Chanos says MCD is absolutely taking market share in the restaurant business.
"At the end of the day, people are still going to McDonald’s. They know how to drive people into their store, I don’t like their food and won’t eat there but I’ll buy and hold their stock because drive by a store and their are lines of people at breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
mad shows a growth of .44 but a list of $162.73. This is a decline of $.57. What am I missing??
This is the key point of the conference call: McDonald's (MCD) said it expects to have negative free cash flow in the second quarter.Earnings will be negative in Q2.
100 stock... overpriced
"Will a second global shutdown affect McDonalds? I mean, all the people that work there are really clean and healthy. Who wouldn't take food handled by them during a pandemic? MCD will be a big winner in a second shutdown."
"employment will go the other wayrecession is herenational debt interest alone is 20% of the US business's profitsmilitary the samemilitary doesn't count veterans benefitsthen you have pension, social security, college loans, etc."
"There are few more likely scenarios in 25 years of market watching than MCD taking a hit to $120 and fast. Sales are sharply down, foot traffic disappearing, Wendy’s gaining ground... blood in the water"
"SELL your MCD ----the NFL will destroy MCD , do we support the flag , or BLM players --- oil is a better buy , war with North Korea , oil goes up $10---$15 in a week----"
MCD needs to fire all the workers who are wasting time smoking in the parking lot and not working . The savings on that alone would bring the stock price up to $215.00

"STAY LONG MCD. Also, pick up some LK imo."
"Profit taking today. Let's see if it hits 160, again."
Really! this should not go down. What #$%$.
The Bears and shorts are out in full force. This is a normal correction and a good thing to firm up before the next run up. The economy is rebounding and the warm weather is not far off. I drove past 3 McDonalds today and the drive through lineups were so long. Once the restaurant reopens it will be full too. Lots of kids big and small are missing it. The Dow will head towards 40000 because interest rates are not going to rise enough for people to pull out of stocks. A couple of percentage points is inconsequential.
MCD is down 4.90% to 199.56
SANP little a little tiny.. $$$$$$
whats up with this stock
Going higher!!!!
"The most important metric:McDonald's quarterly sales at its U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months grew at its slowest pace in over a year to 2.6 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of a 2.96 percent rise."
"the Daily pop sellers keep it from going higher, soon to be burned one morning when it opens up big,they don't have the guts to stay short as its easy to see when they cover."
French fry shortage = bearish outlook?
This stock is going to 190
"I started going to Wendys and Burger King for breakfast. Cheaper especially with coupons. Being a senior, you need all the breaks you can get with this failure Trump admin."
500 additional stores. Quite an accomplishment coming our way.
when this falls below 110 I'd consider buying this
Load the boat on $MCD
Holding till 180.
Everybody taking profit
"so, why the $2 drop starting at 11:20 this morning?"
The haamburglar got caught??!!!
I predict MCD will drop sharply to $120 in just five sessions. Then it will takes one year to eighteen months to the bear market low $90 or $95. This will be a painful process for people who are waiting the stock market to turn around. This one is not like the one in 2000 or 2008. This is mother nature. You cannot throw money to make it go away.
"Easy money - Sell at open, buy back at closingMarket is soft and weak, no way to see green"

who is going to MCD for mCchicken virus when workers from MCD were on youtube complaining they get no sick days and were coming to work cooking the fast food while they had covid19 no wonder trump wanted to make a waiver on releasing all your rights to sue these companies for negligence if you die from the virus from them.

Should a company feeding people junks go under?
PE to high its going much much lower. Chick fil a makes MCD and every other fast food near them ghost towns. Check the CFA website to see new stores opening around the country/world that will be eating close by McDs SSS for lunch. MCD market cap nearly tripled since 2010? Ya right thats going to last LOL
Can McDonalds be up on a red day?
what happened at close

back to 190?and eventually 170 or so
looks to me like a classic head and shoulders pattern forming with tomorrows catalyst breaking its neck. I see a break below 200
Americans are really living on junks .now. Walmart and McDonald filled with stupid people everywhere imho
Beautiful chart. Should be well over $180 after earnings.
MCD is making a huge mistake cooking meatless burgers on the same grill as the meat burgers. More business will be lost than gained. Please trade accordingly.

Two months ago I said this stock will go to 190 because there is no competition; best and cheapest food stock out there with excellent store renovation and economies of scale; people need a cheap place to grab food quickly and efficiently

"I think the 10 year treasury yield was up around 3.28% last November, check2.57/3.28 * 183 = $143 per shareProblem is they borrowed so much money to do buybacks and then they borrowed more and now owe $39B39,069,600 37,071,700 33,228,200 30,850,800the most recent year is at the left, these are the total liabilities from year to yearthey have $9 billion more liabilities in three yearsduhSo, $147 may be hightime for MCD to correct to a reasonable price."

This is nothing more than a healthy pullback after a great run.

"Looking at the data, we can see that 57% of McDonald's's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;buybacks also occurred, which make the PE look lower than otherwise, if the shares are retired, which I believe they are, but check;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;the article says they are paying out 73% of the cash flowbut look at the how much the obligations increased and the $8 billion negative assets in one quarterFriday jobs report should have an affect, but it went up on the ADP number, when it should have sold off in my opinion.

After seeing all the red I did a sell order at $52.9 so I could still make a little. Well, It closed at $54.1, which was up by a whopping 2.85% on a big down day...

Impossible's plant-based meat use genetically modified soy, leg-hemoglobin as a color additive and heme to mimic meat..genetically modified. Beyond’s plant-based meats use natural ingredients, pea's, bean's, brown rice and healthy oils which allows them to not have to genetically modified their ingredients.I'm not sure about everyone else but I'm not eating genetically modified fake meat!"

"In my opinion only, we are in the society where Facebook, social media, twitter are the news outlets. They drown out fake news CNN that is my opinion only. I am not out to destroy McDonald’s or sabotage their franchise. Political correct we are all one race no matter what color. Do you know what race that is? The human race. If you are black, white, Spanish, yellow an d orange if you are human you are part of that race. My belief about racism and my part is being in the other’s shoes. Nobody should be racist.

McDonald’s has a huge buyback and this stock will reach 190 very very soon

This stock sucks. Did not participate the rally.
It should go to 80 as the current price is way over valued assuming very high growth
People should stop going to McDonald's. They hike the price and continue serving garbage. The same sandwich keeps shrinking but price is doubled. I know old habit die hard but people should think before they enter McDonald's.
My office staff loves the McChicken this week. We lost a big customer and need to tighten our belt. Go $MCD
Back under $190 soon.
"Seeking alpha comments belowWhile the metrics supporting the share price of MCD have improved considerably, the fundamentals of the overall company performance have not. In the past 12 years, EPS had a CAGR of 7%, while their long-term debt and dividend have grown at a CAGR of almost 12%. Meanwhile, MCD's net income has only grown at a CAGR of just over 3%. MCD management has been aggressively using debt as a way to pump up returns to compensate for the relatively stagnant performance in their business. At today's price of $177 per share, I believe that MCD shares are trading at a 40% premium to their intrinsic value. MCD stock carries enormous risk of losing a considerable amount of value if one were to start a position at these prices."
"Buy below the $180s. Sell in the low $200s. Rinse & repeat. MCD is virtually no risk, so I trade $100k each time. If it stagnates awhile, I know it will return to the $200s in short time. Especially if there’s a vaccine!"

"Maybe time to sell. PE pretty high for not growing income or revenues. Dividend maybe a little lower than the 10 year, check, but the 10 year is going up. This means MCD's growing debt will have a higher interest rate in the future. The news says restaurants same store sales are falling. And MCD was at $110 within the year. And the market is going to sell off. And we are way above the moving averages. Could fall to 160 before bouncing."

Ok MCD. Let’s get to $190 tomorrow please.
"Took a position in this 2 weeks ago after going to one of the locations that had been upgraded to the new look and feel. I was so impressed, and didn't even feel like I was in a McDonalds. It was really great, nothing at all like what you are used to. No clown, none of the old look. I felt a Warren Buffet moment. Might take a while but if they pull this off in all the locations, it is transformative and exactly what they needed to do."

"When it goes up and they are not buying, but selling to index funds and retail, by the bots running it up, trading back and forth without accumulation, that's manipulation, a felony.Wish the SEC would ask for a share count.

One in three drivers tamper with your food. they are uneducated slackers who are jealous and no morals they’re going to an upscale neighborhood to deliver food they will tamper with your food they are with the BLM￼.

MCD like Yahoo everybody loves junk
LOL... and a couple of fools were touting this for earnings....this is a straight up sell as fast as you can stock..over priced #$%$
I think the dust hasn't even settled for mcdonald's. If drive thrus are going to continue and mcd franchisees are only given deferred rent then this will be a huge problem down the line. If MCD will waive rent then it's another story but that will be a lot of rent debt to carryover year to year. I don't care if you guys see long lines at mcdonald's. They need to move their product quick and if only drive thru is an option then it will turn away customers. They need to be churning their meals because they are the walmart of hamburgers. You guys might be seeing those long #$%$ lines but thats still not enough profit for franchisees.
"MCD cannot always hit home runs; hiccups are just that. Their earnings was mid single digits off, not double digits.CMG's p/e is 70+DNKN's p/e is 27+AMZN's p/e is 72+"
"earnings may be up, but they earn 4 cents on the dollar. And it's up and down and depends what quarter or year you compare it to. The debt says they are messing up. The revenue says they may be messing up, at least it's going down. Franchising isn't working that great for Wendys."
"AS USUAL. MCD gets all these upgrades from $230-$250, and the stock is slow to react. ALWAYS gives you time to ACCUMULATE the stock/JUNE CALLS cheaper before the next level higher.TAKE ADVANTAGE OF price weakness while you can! "
I am up 483% in my MCD investment. I flipped quarter pounders and fried chicken McNuggets at McDonalds when I turned 16. Good memories becoming financially self sufficient. God bless America!

"McDonald's menu the past year has been total garbage. ZERO healthy offerings in most markets. Everything is fried, fried, fried. What happened to the grilled wraps? The grilled chicken sandwich? The salads? COVID is becoming an EXCUSE for POOR SERVICE. I am surprised McDonald's legal allowed their menu to become so bad, health-wise. With a few ""healthy"" choices, McDonald's could defend itself in court. Today? Not possible. Go look at the drive-through board and find a single healthy choice. I'll bet you can't."

This is the worst fast food chain. The menu is so outdated. Thinking of any McDonald's item makes me want to vomit. The CEO is an accountant and not a foodie. He has to go. I anticipate MCD stocks price will crash to double digits later this year and CEO will be forced to resign.
McD employees need to quit asking me “do you want your change back?”
Check out Lisa Bouchelle's new CD...Great songs. Gorgeous gal!! I luv it.
"what if they do buybacks and then the price falls back to the 52 week low of 14725% loweror to the 2 year lowJP Morgan, I think, said the 10 year treasury will go to 4% or higher2.63/4 *184 = $121 per share; 2.63 is the dividend percentthe 10 year was up around 3.25% in 2018at some point MCD wil reach their limit of debt borrowing without going into Junk, I think Seeking Alpha said 2019, which is this yearlook at 3.25% fed rate2.63/3/25 *184 = $149so $149 could be support or $147, the previous 1 year low"
I feel this stock is unreasonably priced at such a high valuation.

Let's get real here. This is McDonalds. There's one in every country in every town. It's part of the very fabric of society. It's always going to be a strong performer.
Buy at $204.00
One of the stocks I regret not buying earlier
MCD making a huge mistake comingling meatless and meat burgers on the same cooking devices. Please trade accordingly.
How does this chain stay in business? I walked out of one Sat night about 8PM because I couldn't get waited on. Went next door to the Mexican restaurant. Today at a different location it took 18 minutes for them to serve me an Egg McMuffin at 2PM. I could have bought groceries and made it myself in that time. Chick-Fil-A can serve 6-7 people in the time it take MCD to serve one. I hope they all aren't all like the ones near me.
I'm for MCD giving better retirement benefits for 25 year or longer workers.What they get now is a total joke.
$183 holding price is bullish.
Everybody hates Easterbrook. He only knows deep into debt to buy back shares. See how much debts this guy accumulated since 2015.
MCD offers a Grand Big Mac in Milwaukee; tastes the same with much more bun. Not much more meat. Won’t order again.
Stood in line for 30 minutes for a dollar 29 cent biscuit this morning. SERVICE IS GETTING WORSE.
Not that great. Only matched. Was expecting much better! Stock will pullback.

"Ex-dividend day. Expecting a red day, but should easily recover very soon."
How come certain people never want to accept responsibility for their poor decisions?
2pm dump again
This sure would be nice to see this split at least 2 for one or better yet 3 for one!!!
The best stock in the market; going exdividend next week; this stock will hit 200 in a couple of months
McDonald's just does things right
I expect MCD to cut 25% or 33% dividends soon. They cannot sustain the strategy to borrow money to pay dividends especially the revenue and earnings are down significantly. The stock price will drop 25% or 33% when they announce the dividends cut. Other companies began to announce dividends cut because Covid 19 is getting serious.
McD's has been one of my core holdings for years. Sitting on 1200 shares.I just let the divy re-invest and cost basis is now under $50 a share. Notbad.

The fast food hamburger is King. McDonald's has the tastiest beef in the industry. This juggernaut cannot be stopped. It's a worldwide marketing machine. Customers around the globe will eat whatever McDonald's tells them to eat. McDonald's is King.
Shorts are doing their best to badmouth McDonald’s; they don’t understand this is the best fast food company hands down by far; best value and food that tastes good excellent renovation of stores and large economies of scale;

I sure would like to see MCD split so more younger people could jump in and get a decent amount of shares at these prices they just can not do that. I am a long time holder of MCD and my first shares were around $15.00 per share.
$MCD should buy Waffle House and White Castle. That would provide shareholders a few extra places to go for special occasions.
"McDonald's does really well in depressed, recession like scenarios, don't expect your other companies to do as well or better, with exceptions like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, Pepsi, Coke etc."
The stock dropped because it made new highs and so people started selling. All my stocks making new highs are being sold.
Can’t wait for it to bounce back up 10%

There are so many novice stock investors today that they are easily fooled by fake growth newsI suggest everyone holding MCD stock at these nose bleed price levels just check out the following latest figures after the stock was pushed up since September because of these results which were published last week? I would be very careful as this stock could collapse by as much as it did last February when it fell by $16 on February 5thall that is needed is one day with selling volume of 10 M out of the 770 M float and the stock will repeat the February plunge or worse https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/key-statistics?p=MCDSales growth yoy minus 6.7% earnings growth minus 13.2% What do insiders think of the stock ?they are not impressed they sold out in July 2017 after the Q2 report and now hold less than one tenth of a percent of outstanding shares leaving the balance sheet trashed with almost $32B in debt.

"Pity about the CEO. MCD did really well under his leadership. You would think in this day and age CEOs would know better. Saying that, he'll easily get another choice role somewhere else. And he leaves with a golden parachute. And perhaps his girlfriend? Though if he's married, his wife (who I'm sure will sue for divorce) will get half of everything. Love can be expensive in the CEO suite !"

"MCD at 210.00 is NOT a GIFT !. It is a SHORT !. Dow up a few days, MCD down. MCD P/E way too high. MCD voted the worst hamburgers among fast food places. Look at the 3, 6, 1 year charts and tell me that MCD is a screaming buy. No way. Traders are taking profits.....can't lose all that profit that the made, lock in the profit. If I thought MCD was a but I would state so. I belong to a trading class and it was recommended to SHORT MCD. I looked at the chart and I agree with them. Time will tell if I am right or wrong.

"Most of the news articles on MCD appear to be pumping the stock and ignoring reality. A slow growth company like MCD having gone up 72% within a two year period is nonsense. For long term investment, its a sell. Wouldn't look at it until the Price to Sales falls back to the level that Wendy's has 3.16. That's less than half the Price to sales of 6.74 posted here on Yahoo Finance MCD Statistics. The analysts are pumping for retail to buy so they can sell. Insiders have been dumping and were dumping it $20 lower, large amounts, tens of thousands of shares. I saw one that sold 20,000 shares or so at $163."

I heard a news report that a customer was served a cup of detergent in a coffee cup in a McDonald's restaurant.
"Seeking alpha comments belowWhile the metrics supporting the share price of MCD have improved considerably, the fundamentals of the overall company performance have not. In the past 12 years, EPS had a CAGR of 7%, while their long-term debt and dividend have grown at a CAGR of almost 12%. Meanwhile, MCD's net income has only grown at a CAGR of just over 3%. MCD management has been aggressively using debt as a way to pump up returns to compensate for the relatively stagnant performance in their business. At today's price of $177 per share, I believe that MCD shares are trading at a 40% premium to their intrinsic value. MCD stock carries enormous risk of losing a considerable amount of value if one were to start a position at these prices.if they beat, get ready to sell the news, put a stop in at least and keep your profits"
"Lordy.. upscope today, $200+. Global sales way up, even counting the negative FX. All you psuedo shorts and MCD haters, there's a 2for1 Egg McMuffin deal so I'll give you one if you show up at MCD this morning.."

"Its all media hype....this is getting to be old news. The Flu kills 40,000+ each year and CV only 2900 and only affects elderly folks with pre-existing conditions. Most people don't even know they have it just common cold symptoms. Everyone is building immunities over time and weather changes will take this virus out. BUYING more this week on any dips."

120 or nothing..
dividend 2.63%10 year yield 3.2%2.63/3.2 * 180.3 at the moment = $148 per share based on comparison with the 10 year treasurybut the 10 year is going upand they have massive liabilities
"FWIW, I shorted 100 shares at $185.65.....put a stop at $190....but I DO N OT see anyway this continues to rally....it is farther above it's 50 day average than I have ever seen it!!! Clearly, this was all company buying stock back at any price. I hope the FED continues to raise to 4%....they have INFLATED asset prices waaaaay to much!!"
"Down 30 in 30 days, I think I'll wait a little longer."
Need this cheaper. Sub 150 to buy.
"MCD is up after hours, yahoo error. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mcd"
Anonymous is starting to post his nonsense; yesterday he was saying McDonald’s will drop to 160
Bloody day..or is that ketchup
This stock is sky high...right up on the resistance level. Over priced and due to come down 
"executives at McDonalds should go to jail for manipulating this stock so much with buybacks, my opinion. What a scam!"
My advanced Modigliani technical analysis is showing 265
Buy BYND instead
"When they announce earnings, it will be shocking."
"In my opinion only there is a problem at McDonald’s. They have a racist call and I will tell you more about it.My experience recently I encountered a confrontation with a McDonald’s employee. He was racist or could be racist. Who knows? I do not like labeling people. I am French, German, Portuguese, Brazilian and black relatives. There is not a racist part of me at all. A lot of my Facebook friends and close friends are black. I do not have any racial bias. I do not see race I see people. White black yellow green. We are all in a group. We all have a percentage of a group. I see people the way they are. We are all one color. We are all human. We are a mixture of varieties that make us unique. We do not criticize or condemn a race. If we do we become not a part of the human race. Recently I was encountered when a McDonald’s employee treated me racist because I look more white than black or Spanish. I was served with disrespect and ignorance of knowledge. I was not given respect as a customer. Everybody who is a paying customer regardless of race should be treated equally and respectfully. The theory is the customer is always right. Unfortunately this was not the case. I am about to file a lawsuit against mcdonald’s for racism that occurred at my last visit that was not resolved. They tried to apologize for it with a letter and one free meal. Really? You think an apology letter and one free meal will resolve this matter for the racist act."
Waz UP ??
Anyone in Canada ! Is McDonald continuing with beyond meat Mc PLT in Canada ?
Looking to buy more around $174 or so.

"I am worried. McDees coffee was the best, I drank 2-3 cups a day. Last 3 weeks over so the coffee is not very good. Have they changed their brew?"

Who is dumb enough to open a business up in the hood? of course insurance is going to cost a lot more in certain areas. They brought it on themselves when they go around looting and burning down businesses in their own backyard. Destroying your own neighborhood is just plain stupid IMO
Today I took a huge dump and realized my $MCD McChickens were loosening up. Charity dump felt good.
"Busted through the $200 closing ceiling, now to 17June for that dividend feeling!"
"Chik fil a voted best fast food restaurant third year in a row. McDonalds came in at number 20, dead last. And the God haters, Trump haters, liberals and LGBTers arent one bit pleased about it lol"
This will be good when the dividend reinvestment hits!
“The Founder” summarizes how MCD is a simple money making machine. It’s lifelong price chart is a smooth constant rise as it pays a healthy dividend. It’s competition in contrast have ragged performance in their charts.
Market is up over $250 pts and MCD is down with a buy rating of 1.9 what am I missing???
"is 8% growth correctif so, a PE os 28 plus says MCD is way too highhalf that might be too highthe dividend is OK, but 2.6% is low compared to a lot of income investmentsand it might not be sustainable, as they appear to support it with debt; or the buybacks are supported with debt172 seems like supportcan go a lot lower150'slower even"
220!! In a week or so
McDonald's Holdings Japan is launching a Pokémon GO initiative. Pokémon GO is launching tomorrow in Japan which should be massive. $MCD

"Dear MCD stock, show me some love, my kids need new shoes."
MCD isn’t reacting like it did the last two days. Market going down but MCD is holding it’s price at $181. This strength sounds promising.
"with nationwide HEALTH EMERGENCY!!! why does MCD still have there ""TOUCH"" screen order up???see if your LUCKY and get it from SCREEN??""?"
Tomorrow I believe this will oGap up at the open and finally close over $200 .
MCD's will be 250 in no time.
MCD is up 5.69% to 158.00
"Okay, reversed my so called opinion and decided to jump into the stock this morning at 193 and change!! Possible move to 200 and change possible. If I'm wrong then I'll double down around 160."
Blame the Senate for holding up corporate tax reform yesterday. That's what triggered this.
$15 minimum wage will hurt MCD. They will probably have to layoff workers.

TOOK SOME CMG GAINS. Plenty of dry powder. Looking to RELOAD on MCD March/June Calls cheaper this week on additional weakness. 
One outbreak from this company and the stock will drop like a rock!
McDonald's thinks their former CEO is gross... do they even know what they serve.....
McDonald's is up 5.21% to 227.85
The glazed tenders are great! If you don’t believe me try them out
Strong Sell. Chart is set up for a bear pattern. This is a bull trap....
Why do McDonald's still pay the full dividends while firing employees and closing stores? They should cut dividends by 25% or 40%.
Stock sucks!
Chart looks horrible....and that is with markets at record highs!
Who would have ever thought that going to Mickey D's you would end up with a haircut?Well if you bought this stock recently that's what happened. Earning came out a handfulof French fries less than a Happy Meal.
Yay for me....I have never made as much money on a short as I have made on MCD. Then best part is that I used the cash while holding the short position to over-extend myself in names that have made money. The cost was 2 quarters' dividends. Yay for me!!!
McDonald's ROCKS!!i remember when their stock was 15 bucks and i wouldn't doubt it if someone downgraded back then.Great food....
Strong Sell! This stock will keep dropping. Pick up HD or KO. Both doing good in this down trend.
GE and Sears of fast food.
"McDonald’s stock buybacks destroyed this companies balance sheet to be in a negative equity position. Before the buybacks this company had billions of cash on hand that would have helped in the situation we are in now. All those buybacks the past Five years are now worthless. Stock buybacks should be illegal, and this covid19 is a perfect example of why. You should always be ready for system shocks and have a strong balance sheet to be able to weather them."
isn't this oversold already? come on
This stock makes no sense to me.
Where is my Múlan McNugget sauce?
"I remain convinced that MCD can take major share from Chik-fil-A with their replica chicken sandwich. That would open up another avenue of increased earnings, especially on Sundays."
"Overvalued right now, wait for a pullback to $175 then BUY"
CMG will destroy MCD!!!
Few people still want to eat outside even take out.
I have owned MCD for over 20 years and have not sold 1 share.
"WENDY's is a Buying Opportunity.Buy WEN, and Come On Get happy!"
"Congratulations to Arbys, for changing their bun on their French Dip and Swiss sandwiches. They used to be light, and a bit dry., and bland, like a soft sponge. About a week ago, it was more like a roll, something you could bite into. Better texture. A bit more flavor. Maybe they could look into having one with oregano or other herbs, for an appealing Italian taste. But the French swiss is superb, because of the onion dipping sauce. And if McDonalds ever develops a sauce for their grilled chicken sandwich, I'd start buying it again. The tiny amount of bland sauce does nothing to enhance the empty taste of chicken. Perhaps they could look into putting a chicken rub on their chicken, before the heat it. I'm not sure why anyone goes out and buys a bland chicken sandwich. Apparently some people like that. If it wasn't for the lettuce and tomato, the chicken sandwich wouldn't have any appealing taste."
MCD. My dog.
"McDonald is best positioned and will do very well during pandemic. Love them quarter pounders, apple pie, fries and chocolate shake."
Since McDonald’s held 200 the technicals are indicting 220 easily
Cant wait for the dividend
Can you say TRASH
"Another 5,000 at $221.00I love MCD!!!!"
"I am up 483% on my MCD position, just plain lucky... Many years ago, I was in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and noticed all the kids hanging out at McDonalds restaurants. I also noticed the same when I visited Asian countries on business trips. I myself am not that fond of fast food, but there’s money to be made."
"UPGRADES COMING IN RAPIDLY!!!! Goldman Sachs analyst Katherine Fogertey said McDonald’s, along with Domino’s Pizza Inc., Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Wingstop Inc., could pick up market share once health restrictions ease.“We see a very strong potential for the digital and delivery enabled brands in particular to perform well coming out of the pressures,” Fogertey said in a note to clients. Goldman has a buy recommendation on the stock."
"PE = 24.55FPE 19Maybe FPE is based on the new tax law. Probably.Fresh beef a good thing, bad for WEN.growth maybe 4%, someone here said 8%price two times too high based on thatDividend is 2.57%. 10 year rate fell to 2.741 %. Was higher, 2.84%, wil likely go back to that level and beyond.Shorter term rates are up pretty high. Companies are borrowing for 5% even, depending on their credit.2.57/2.741 * 156.37 = $146.62The margin debt is at record highs. The market fell but is still due for a major correction. The Warren Buffet Indicator hit 151, the same level as during the internet bubble. China is leaning toward not buying us treasuries. The world is leaning more away from the US dollar. The US stock market is in dollars. 401Ks and all have an obligation to get out with profits. A recession lingers. The market will fall and fall and then they will say, we are in a recession. Wall Street will cut back on margin and cut the high fliers like they have been with FANG. MCD and WEN are high flyers in terms of PE ratios, especially WEN. The recession means less discretionary spending. Retail will take a major hit in the next few months, I believe.Look at a 5 year chart to see support. Credit card and short term borrowing rates have already moved up substantially. What will be the value if interest rates go to 4%?2.57/4.0 * 156.38 = $100 per share Now go look at a long term chart."
Should open at $155 on Monday.
Morons will be happier under Trump
MCD will do better in pandemic situation when other restaurants have to limit intake and close doors again. Drive in and delivery is the key.
"This is dumb.... To my knowledge $MCD had already ruled out using $BYND in there product line because of cost. If anything happens from $MCD entering the space it will be to the benefit of $BYND due to the increase in consumers. This is like saying that $ROKU suffers from the Kindle firestick, when in reality it just caused more people to cut the cord."
I wonder how much and what he walks out with?
MCD going to fly higher as experimenting with robotic machine that make the food and already has launched kiosks for ordering foods. In the near future no need for employees
Mc Long
Going to 200 this year.
"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.phpsee the second chart downnote the internet bubblewe went close to that, fell some, and went up againget ready for a larger correction"
Beefless burgers coming. I do not think this will increase the price. Any thoughts?
Temporary Network Error. Please try again later... my #$%$!!!!Guess I gotta go to an American website.
"The kiosk's have nothing to do with $15 minimum wage. The CEO is trying to increase the bottom line and he is saving money by getting rid of employees, benefits, salaries, etc. Someday when no one is working anymore because all these companies have saved money and no one can afford to buy their products anymore I guess they will call it Karma. They are only doing what other major retailers have already done. Home depot was a great paying job with health benefits and is now kiosk only and maybe an occasional cashier. CEO just used the $15 wage as a way to keep the criticism and heat off himself. Probably going to switch from the pink slime they put in burgers to a less expensive chemical that is green and tell us it is more natural due to the colorant, lol. All these fast food companies are seriously unhealthy, make lunch, keep your kids away from this stuff."
Open maybe RED but close GREEN!
recession will help take MCD back towards tot 52 week low
My friend and I drove all 12 of our Fast Macs off the flight deck of the USS Yorktown in the late '80s. Can someone please recover our Fast Macs from the sea floor in Charleston and we'll reward you with a gift card to enjoy even more of the delicious and healthy food of McDonald's
bought my first MCD shares at 198.8
"up on no volume, straight up = manipulation not buyingfed can tightenmcd balance sheet looks like pukebuybacks and dividends to control pricerestaurant business has too much compeition and better restaurants, real restaurants, not mcd"
On a run for a couple weeks now. New chicken sandwich's said to have increased sales. Also summer is coming and covid may be in the rear view mirror at some point. That should allow open doors for walk through traffic in the stores that are still closed. This all means more $$. Don't be surprised if future store designs cater to an explosion of drive through traffic.
I am going to wait and buy back in March

"I laugh my face off at the MCD naysayers. Either you were born with a mental deficiency or you are just plain DUMB, either for which there exists no cure.Look at the stock price since 2000. MCD will do another stock split soon. Do you ever see an empty MCDees restaurant?Open your eyes and use that grey matter lodged between your ears."
fully agree. Bounce back next week.
Maybe because Wendy's announced it is getting into the breakfast game? This is just a blip. We have been rallying for a while. Go Longs! More Mcprofits ahead.
"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?"

Only good thing about this dog is it’s dividend.

Needs a 50% haircut.
rough numbers6 B earnings - 2.333B dividend average per year for the last 3 years = 3.33 Billion earnings (subtracting out the debt)3.33 B /157 B market cap = 2.12 % return3.33B / 195 B market cap plus obligations = 1.7% return1.7/ 2% (10% yield rate) x $206 current price = $175 per share value based on that

"The free cash flow is only 4.7 billions, if I discount it with 1.25 interst rate + 4 % risk permium for stock, (5.125% discounted rate), the stock worth only 107 - 112, it appears that it is over priced now when there is better alternatives in financials and bio. (e.g. GIlead) which has much better free cash flow and lower P/E. Any thing that I have missed on this stock?"
this is going down

target $158 per sharelower after the recession perhaps
"record breaking market , and this pig is down , yeah that sounds right! why was it up over $4 the other day, a thief is in the woods!"
No matter what metric you look at MCD is massively overpriced. At 200 with a 5.00 dividend it only yields 2.5% but is 66% of its profits to cover the 2.5 yield. Thats right its yield that basically covers inflation eats up 66 out of every 100 pennies it makes every day. Thats what happens when an old mega cap stock gets run up to a 26PE in a 10 year bull market. Huge correction coming over the next year to bring this closer to fair value.

"Take some chips off table here, it has run up quite a bit from recent lows. In the long term it'll probably be ok. But short term is anybody's guess. April 30 we'll know how bad it is, but I think the quarter after that is even worse. Don't want to hold this over the upcoming earnings. Will build position again when pull back."
Fresh quarter pounder now on the menu. I got a bunch of thumbs down when I said a month ago this would occur. This is just the start. All beef pattie offerings will be fresh within a year. Sales will increase!

It’s a good time for the great taste.

"Long term charts said there are not support levels: $170, $160 and $120. I think the first two levels will be broken in the next three months. Only $120 is the true support."

Like I said a few days ago ...
someone at mcd's spreading hepatitis to costumers in Kentucky it says
MCD will be as red as Ronald McDonalds hair in the morning tomorrow.
"Front runners did not make money on today's MCD announcement. A lot of buyers in the past two days because they are close to the company and know today McD US president will announce better September comp due to Scott Travis meal promotions. But MCD fail to make new 52 week high today because most traders think this news is not worthy. People went to buy Travis Scott meal because it is $3 cheaper than the same Quarterpounder meal which is $9 in regular menu price. This company is squeezing the shrinking customer base. But there are less and less customers who want to pay $9 a meal. Especially compared to Chick-Fil-A, Wendy's and many casual diners. They are either better value or tastier."
"I have seen the future Always remember actions have consequence. McDonalds will need to have a staff of grief counseling that they can move from one McDonald to the other as their new RACIST discriminating why of promoting ends with some very bad out comes for lots of people . If I told you how I have seen the future you will never in a millions year believe me LOL,LOL I have to LOL or I would be on the floor curled up in a little ball crying my eyes out. Question for you McDonalds to you really believe that being more RACIST and Discriminating to whites is going to help or hurt race relation in the future ? I already know what is going to happen because I was shown the future. I am asking you what do you really think is going to happen by the actions you are now taking?"
Burger King and McDonald's both can claim to be King. I'd eat at either restaurant. Both serve top notch meals. Best burgers I've ever tasted.
This is going to 190 tonight!!!!
Hoping for a new all time high this week
this is a $200 stock by December
who feels lucky today?
Going back up. earnings will be very good tomorrow.
Any news on why this is up big today? Im happy but just wondering...
"The $MCD manatee burger is going to be a big winner, with gluten free bun with garlic mayo. Yummy"
"United States Department of Agriculture standards[3][dead link] for processed, packaged ""Salisbury steak"" require a minimum content of 65% meat, of which up to 25% can be pork, except if de-fatted beef or pork is used, the limit is 12% combined. No more than 30% may be fat. Meat byproducts are not permitted; however, beef heart meat is allowed. Extender (bread crumbs, flour, oat flakes, etc.) content is limited to 12%, except isolated soy protein at 6.8% is considered equivalent to 12% of the others. The remainder consists of seasonings, fungi or vegetables (onion, bell pepper, mushroom or the like), binders (can include egg) and liquids (such as water, milk, cream, skim milk, buttermilk, brine, vinegar etc.). The product must be fully cooked, or else labeled ""Patties for Salisbury Steak""."
Now that's more like it!
don't buybuy off the moving averages or get stuck with it in the redthe PE is way too high for a very low growth stockway too much debt and growing
How can this stock be up over $5.00 and then be down over $1.30???

"My McD position is up almost 400%. She spits out a sensible dividend, and has restaurants all over the world. I was recently in Sweden, and saw that was the place where teens gang out. I suspect it’s the case in Asia, Australia.... as well. I’ve been reinvesting the dividends and in a few years will start to spend the dividends on toys. Yeuhoo!"
McDonald's going to reverse split

How many illegals work at a single mcd?Nice how McDs can play stupid by using owner operators.
"All longs, you have a reason to celebrate right now and rejoice. The good Lord, Jehovah God spoke to me today and shared with me that we are in for a very strong day tomorrow. The number that was spoken to me is we will be up $10 per share tomorrow and very likely at the open. He led me to share this news with all of you. I know some may heavily critique this, but I’m just a humble servant of the Lord obeying what He has told me. I honestly feel very humble that He bestowed this upon me. May God bless all of us tomorrow with bountiful riches. He has also led me to pledge publicly that I will donate 10% of my profit to those to need it a lot more than me. I have been lead to encourage all of you to do the same. Let’s make a significant difference in this world with all the money we will make tomorrow."
"TIME TO SHORT....double top at $124-$124.....put stop in above, but their business sux and it should drop from here. NOBODY like trash MCD anymore!!!!!!!!!"
"I was at Wendy's last evening. There were 20+ cars in the Wendy's parking lot while the nearby McDonald's had five or six cars, probably the employees'. When I got in Wendy's, the store was packed with customers."
Is it the round bottom?
get in on EWLL while the price is still 10 cents! not a play for the faint of heart but hold a Quarter or two and you will thank me with the opportunities you will have for gains!

TIME TO BUY BYND WITH ANNOUNCEMENT OF ADDING PLANT BASED
Buying INO today can make you rich.
One of America’s best companies founded arguably by the greatest businessman the world has seen so far
"This company has a lot of problems and they began to surface because of the CEO transition. It is not worth even $180 a share. Many expensive Kiosks began to break after only six months. And McDonald's headquarters told the franchisees that these Kiosk are no good anyway because they don't accept cash that 50% of customers are using. They want franchisees to cough up another $50,000 to $75,000 to buy next generation Kiosks. Do they think money growing from the trees?"
"A post from Goodroc who is a McDonald's franchisee discussing how he faced Covid 19 crisis:I own and operate McDonald’s franchises in NYC. Although many do not understand the franchise model, i work on extremely low margins,30% of my revenue is paid to my employees total labor costs. For those standing on a soap box about our pay, which is $15 an hour to start everyone of my general managers and superviors began at min wage and they all now make between from 60k to 150k depending on their tenure , performance and the sales in the restaurants they run.i have a total of 1200 employees combination Both full and part time.My revenue is down 40% and my manhattan locations are down over 60%. Although we have cut hours we have not laid or anyone as we are trying to stay open for our staff , serve customers in need when in many cases it makes zero sense to continue operating.i have to make difficult decisions soon. If i do not manage this as well as possible and I do not survive this then all my employees are out of work.I am have major concerns regarding my ability to survive this crisis. I am not looking for anyone to feel bad for me but as an example of how devastating this crisis will be for our economy the economic impact is hard to fathom."
"Analyst, Guggenheim Partners We view McDonald's fair value to be at the upper end of its forward three-year EV/Ebitda range of 11.7 to 16.3 times, given sustained quick-service restaurant sandwich outperformance. However, we view a slowdown in SG&A reductions and required capex as limiting further upside; therefore, we maintain our Neutral rating."
"Just got the free bacon today and find out they end the 2 for $5 promotion. It is the worst that could happen to MCD. I will short on any spike.As the earnings, I predict it is a miss this quarter. So the CEO hope next quarter people pay full price at McDonald's to make up the earnings miss this quarter. Just see it have the biggest miss next quarter."
"hmmm, interesting"
LOL....looking at chart has NOT touched the 50 day average since FEB 1!!!!! This is like TSLA....a cult stock.....rising rates should dampen enthusiasm for this paltry 2.5% dividend.
"CONSISTENT QUARTERLY DIVIDEND, And HUGE Upgrades by Analysts. NO Brainer."
"Looking at the yearly McDonald’s revenue, its revenue declines year over year, yet somehow the stock price is at all time high. So confusing"
I keep telling you guys don’t worry about McDonald’s- best of breed easy 200 dollars a share
"If you want to see lines go to a chick-fil-a, They have people in lines taking orders and taking money two lines at all time for hours."
"When was the last time someone went to McDonald's to eat because they liked the CEO? They'll get a new McCEO with cheese. In the meantime, shares at a discount. How low will it go???"
I have just performed my own advanced Modigliani technical analysis and this is indicating McDonald’s to 299.99.
Share your opinion about the right price to BUY this stock. What is the right price to enter ?
"BOOM BOOM BOOM, fly MCD :D Goodluck to all."

I quit going there because in Columbus ms both of them are horrible
"07:22 McDonald's should be bought on weakness from CEO change, says Barclays While the CEO transition announced by McDonald's was unexpected, ""and therefore not a good thing,"" the change was not due to operational or financial issues, but rather personal conduct, Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein tells investors in a research note. The analyst is confident the company has the depth in leadership to maintain momentum as the global quick service restaurant leader. As such, he's a buyer of McDonald's shares on any weakness and keeps an Overweight rating on the name with a $225 price target."
"THE OLD FORMAT WAS GREAT, THIS NEW ONE IS BUILL S!!!, I'LL HAVE TO PUT MY PORTFOLIO I N GOOGLE."
"Today I find out that Mc Donalds medium drinks are now about 20% smaller than they had been, for years. The good, they were probably too big to begin with, and are now truly a medium size, and its less high fructose corn syrup we ingest. The bad, they didn't lower prices, did they ? So if they didn't lower prices, for giving us less product, then they should see more profit in the future."
Like I said this is going up today
Another down day. RSI is in the 24 range. What the heck is going on?
"we have heard the world economy is slowingmcd is a world businessinterest rates are moving upthey have excessive debtthe debt increas in one year was nearly the amount they wasted on the dividend, the same for the buybackin good times, they needed to pay off the debt, not borrow for buybacks and to give away moneyinsider sellingIf you own it, sell half at leastif you own it, put in stops and protect in case it goes to its true value, around $110 per shareif insiders are selling, it seems likely that they feel the price is high and going lower; not necessarily, but likelydon't gamble"
"Buy 190 puts with 2 days time - they are free, and we are going there. Thank me at the close Friday"
McDonald’s investors snookered by wall st pros who hype do they can sell as mid MISSED earnings when there are massive tax breaks which is not good news
"DIV increase decision should be imminent ... the last three increases were announced on Sept19, Sept20, Sept 21 with increases of 7.8, 14.9, and 7.5 percent"
I find the Burger King Big Fish kind of small. But better tartar sauce than $MCD
Keybanc. Increased the price for MCD from 225 to 235
Thanks for the hard work Thanks for the great dividend
MCD is a great company with declining revenues and US traffic declines. Unfortunately this means lower PE. I see MCD trending lower and will buy if it heads under $150.
"this stock is a hedge fundtrade has nothing to do with valuationPE 100modest growth absurd50 dma is under $700and it generally goes substantially below that, around $638 per share last time"
too cheap...buy from here for long term....
Jumping into 7 year old chicken sandwich war next year. What a forward thinking company!!!
Anonymous - can you please stop posting? Your posts appear to have the opposite of your desired effect.
This stock is the worse.
"The once decent signature McDonalds cheeseburger for a buck is now 1.20. 20% increase as the burger is 7% smaller and tasted on the level of Crystals, one step higher than dog food. The extra salt did not help the flavor. If you are going to decrease the burger size, reduce the bun with it. Seriously, McDonalds and the food has become a joke. This is a short sell."
Shouldn’t we be getting ready for “the MCRIB “ soon??? Mr. EASTERBROOK please tell the “ guys “ to hurry it up.
"I am not being a downer, but I am a realist, MCD is trading at a premium valuation, which is not match by it's revenue, which has been falling y/y on the charts I looked at on market watch. The key is to buy a stock which is fairly or undervalued not overbought such as MCD is with questionable fundamentals. I think what is happening is people are buying MCD without doing a thorough analysis of the companies financials. MCD's price to sales is 5.1 while the industry average is 2.7, MCD's stock price is over inflated it is similar to buying an apple for five dollars when an apple can be bought for .50 cents at most other stores. The feds will continue to raise rates and MCD stock price will decrease."
Maybe he can work with Ken Fischer now....
wish I was privy to the INSIDER NEWS ONLY when mcd was at $198 last week !! it's clear to see what happened looking back- puddin eaters.
They need to bring back the Milan McNugget sauce like they promised. Why do they keep breaking promises? They promised it would be back in December in unlimited quantities. It didn’t come back until March and then only temporarily. What the heck??
UBS upgrading McDonald’s when sales are lagging so far behind with increased unemployment for their loyal customer base. U tell me if ubs is buying a single share lol
McDonald's came in dead last in fast food restaurant ratings. 20 out of 20.
Did McDonalds change coffee brands? The new blend is not as crisp. They also need to turn down the burners. My cup was so hot it seemed dangerous. I enjoy a nice cup of joe but it can’t be too hot.

"https://www.gurufocus.com/term/cash2debt/MCD/Cash-to-Debt/McDonald'sMCD has the worst cash-to-debt ratio among S&P500 companies. A healthy company will have this ratio above 1. Meaning it can pay off all debt if they want to. But after years' borrowing to buy back shares and pay dividends, MCD has almost no cash in her wallet. Even TSLA's ratio is 0.65 and people are saying TSLA has too much debt."

Buy all the mcd you can—- my advanced technicals are showing 225 soon

Most likely this will test Monday low and visit either $190 or $187.50.

Real value stays green on a day like this.
Huge uptick coming next month!! Huge...
"It's hilarious to see the manipulation here from big institutional traders. MCD is way oversold, yet it keeps nose diving. The upcoming short squeeze will quickly put them in their place. It ALWAYS does. It will be devastating for them when this runs up past $200 before they know what hit them."

Two for $5 Filet o Fish ends on Easter. Damn.
"Stock is still SUPER EXPENSIVE at these levels!! Decent resistance at 185 and change (near the double tops from late 2018 - early 2019). Mickey Dees rarely has deals (like Burger King). I think this puppy goes down to at least 185 and change, bounces, and then heads down to around 155-160."
"I guess Mc Donalds had a surge hamburger sales in Texas, Florida, Georgia during the hurricanes and this will increase their third-quarter earning all done at closed stores which represent 20% of their U S market"
The incredible sadness about the MCD stock rise is that it is a direct result of more and more people becoming willing to poison themselves and their kids with so much processed garbage. No wonder the divide between the rich and poor continues to increase in lock step with the MCD stock price.
"I was in a Chick fil A (FOR THE FIRST TIME)the other day and now I understand why it's so popular, the food is fresh(bread is soft and yummy, not old and stale and the chicken is delicious, doesn't taste like cardboard, but what impressed me was the service, the help is very polite, running to my table and wiping it down and then asking me if the sun was bothering me and drawing down the shade.I was like, "" is this a fast food place, where am I!"""

Mcd didn’t participate in Jan rally. Got destroyed in the correction. And hasn’t participated in the rebound. And is now down more premarket. Was a great stock last year but this thing has turned to garbage.
If MCD would announce their deal with BYND both stocks would take off as everyone would be anxious to try a pea based Big Mac. Call it the Big Pea.

"As feasible, buy or add MCD shares on dips, and reinvest the dividends. Have a good day!"

A truly garbage company!!! Mgt is terrible!
This stock now is a defensive stock so it should up only in a down market.
"How can a Filet-o-fish cost 5 bucks,even with a buy one get one for a buck its a joke,thats a 99 cent sandwich at best."
"At 1.16 per share dividend to holders on Dec 3rd most would be stupid to not take a nice cash infusion first. They have reduced their G&A significantly, so even if sales are softer or guest counts a bit lower they have a lot of cash to give you for your loyalty...so yah...I appreciate the quarterly infusion...I earn about $25k a year just on the dividends"
"Large blocks being sold, 15,800 was big money and timed sales of 800 every 30 seconds. Watch the real time data and see why Big money is leaving"
"MCD is a very attractive stock at this level. It’s sad what’s happening to the local one off restaurants in this country but a lot of them aren’t coming back. This market share will spread to the companies that survive, MCD etc. I see McDonalds gaining share in the coming years and most likely a $250 price in the next yr or so."

Staying strong with my monthly DRIP in MCD. I liked McDonalds as a kid and like the company even more as a Big Boy :)
Great buying op....
MCD used to have great burgers and especially fries.I never go to MCD now.Awful food and wayyy overpriced.
loving how MCD is sailing through the storm
"Listening to CNBC last night, they said only 20% of Millennial's have ever tasted a Big Mac. Is that true or fake news? Seems hard to believe. If true, does not bode well for the future of MCD's"
Short it. Market at nosebleed highs and ready to fall. It will made MCD fall more
Closes at the lows on a big market up day.This sticks worse than the new Beyond meat burgers.
"If book value is negative, where a company's liabilities exceed its assets, this is known as a balance sheet insolvency.USA is heading for unprecedented times The amount of bankruptcies will make 1929 look like a bull market"

How is PE of 30 deserved?
Relax. McDonald’s is the best fast food company; have never gotten sick and McDonald’s; way cleaner than any other private restaurant; when you have thousands of restaurants once in awhile an employee will be bad but this is isolated incident
Come on next stop 250... let’s go
"worth $143 about per share based on comparing the dividend to the 10 year treasury yield, which is likely to go up.and when it goes up, it hurts MCD in terms of their long term debt. (future borrowing)"
cash cow! over 10% div!
MCD food are totally junk food!
Looks like some non-MCD owning sourgrapes need a nice pumpkin spice latte to cheer them up!
I m out sold before the drop
Don't worry. It's not like it's a really big up day for any other stocks.

Any signs or chance of MCD splitting?

"I know someone who owns a fast food restaurant in DFW area where shelter in place was for a month or two. Said they broke a record in sales in May operating on drive thru only. I know things are looking bleak but fast food restaurants will thrive most will beat earnings by a lot, I wouldn’t panic sell McDonald’s"

Well at least the dividend is still good.
Ok MCD- I’m in for earnings. Let’s make me some money.
BNN analyst yesterday predicted MCD will collapse and fall another 70% as it did 20 years ago.Says it is way overvalued. Sell this scheisse.
I have a feeling that this stock is going to have a big dive
when will this dismal stock turn around
"Ad I predicted on this discussion board a couple of weeks ago, $MCD has teamed up with $NSRGY for their meatless burgers.@@@McDonald’s is inching closer to getting fully on board the meatless burger bandwagon with a new version in one of its biggest international markets. The burger chain is now selling a vegan burger, the Big Vegan TS, in Germany, one of its five leading overseas markets. Nestle is making the meatless patty for McDonald’s, which first started selling the burger late last month.https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/05/08/mcdonalds-new-meatless-burger-big-vegan-ts/"
I would be cautious on the second wave. It may impact MCD again.
Ronald and you!
Every where you go MCD has lines backed up around the building and for some reason MCD stock has not benn climbing like I think it should be. PFE is another one in the same boat!!
"I am selling today, just made 20% in one week and i am happy with this under the present circumstances. The virus might imply a closing of all the us restaurants ( drive included) as is the case in Europe. Moreover, last years buybacks with debt makes that they have no other ressources than to get new debts now to face the virus consequences. Don’t get me wrong, this company is great but too much risk at the moment, so i expect to buy them far lower later..."

"Right now McDonald's carries a total shareholder's deficit on its balance sheet of $9.29 billion, so its price to book ratio is negative. I have never seen a big capped company have such a negative ratio. That means equity holders got nothing if MCD goes bankrupted. Its debt exceeds the value of its assets plus cash."

bought 515 shares. see you at $220
"do your own homeworkInvestors Place article says if you own it hold on, if you don't don't buy.That's pretty dumb. Its a buy or a sell. By the way its a sell. And the PE in his article is not correct.The new stores amount to 2 or 3 percent growth. I calculated it before and posted it, but forgot. Point is, it aint nothing to brag about. The income growth came from some improvements and a big change in the tax law. The democrats will take care of that most likely. Personally, I don't like the store ""improvements"", especially the Kioshs.Investor Place also mentions the dividend. I compared the dividend to the 10 year yield and got MCD worth $148 per share. Who cares about raises in the divident. You will most likely get a faster raise from the 10 year treasury. How about commercial paper, 6% or more...................................I saw an article that said a million people die per year from fast food. Half of that could be from mcdonalds. 500,000 x $10 M each (lawsuit settlement) = $5 trillion Probably won't happen, but if it did, wow!If someone could prove it statistically and present the proof......The important issue for me is the buybacks. They appear to have borrowed as much as the buybacks. The buybacks are as much as their income for the year. Its all too much. They are working so hard to push up the price of their bloated stock. Why, to sell it? Why are they borrowing money to buyback stocks and to give out dividends. Its terrible financial management for the company, unless they are terribly worried about getting debt downgrades. Is that the issue or are they just unloading shares of their own? Any way you look at it, its wrong for McDonalds. The debt downgrade comes mostly from too much debt. Look how much it went up in 3 years."
"Never really looked in the financials before today, and no I am not short, just looking for honest discord to increase the hive, but 7+ price/sales, EBITDA has increased about 5% in the last 4 years, the debt has doubled, and revs are down 25% and yet the stock has doubled and that doesn't even factor in dividends."
MCD is safest bet for your money as earnings recession is here and MCD is best of class defensive stock. $200+ by end of year

MCD up by .45 in the morning. Might indicate a red day for the overall market. :(
Stock looks like it wants to go lower. Expectations may be a bit too much for current quarter. Hope we see $165 and not $145.
"MCD is one of the best stocks ever for an old fart like me. Nothing fancy, not a high flyer, but spits out a sensible consistent dividend. MCD goes up naturally due to population growth and it's convenient. I'll be driving long distance, and see the golden arches and will stop to use the rest room and grab a bite. It's consistent and rarely any surprises. I've own MCD for what seems forever. It's been a good steady producing investment. It's almost like owning an index fund. Good day!"
"When Morgan Stanley upgraded last week, we know the procedure SELL, SELL. They do not work for retailer investors, they ROBBED them."
All the airports are closed = no salesAll the restaurants are closed = no salesAll the kids are staying home = no staffDuring the 2016 recession MCD was around $90With all the blockers to sales I see this being lower.
"MCD is a fraud company, not just ex-CEO. Their incomes cannot cover the dividends so they are keeping borrowing money to pay dividends. And before Covid 19, they also borrowed to buy back shares. Watch their balance sheet, they have minimal of cash but tons of debts. Who runs a company like that?"
Are the shorts working this stock when the market is up over $350.00 and MCD is down over $3.50?
going higher bought at 65 if It hits 200 selling
"time to sell50 dma 168100 dma 164worth $148 or so based on a comparison to the 10 year treasury yield (compare the dividend)worth about the same based on the earningspump and dump taking placenoone is buying it, but the 401k money rushing in, I imagine, so we are buying it without knowing it"

McDonald’s will not go down much if any; this is not chipotle; specific to lettuce and salads- will have no effect on the company; Still the best company in the food business by far
All of my stock that reached a new high have dropped. That is not a good sign for the stock market.
Earnings were impressive. Look for upgrades
McDonald's on the rise
Investors are fleeing McD. Overvalued at this price. Better value under $182 per share. Save your money.
I wonder when we will hear the new management speak. Things have been real quiet since Steve left. Thoughts?
McDonald's is the best company in the world. This Burger Champ is on sale. Buy it today!

According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 13 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $1.9. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $1.71."

I saw that miss coming a mile away. Under $200 soon
McDonald’s sucks
"How many people die from fast food each year?That's an average of 2 million deaths per annum.

I am looking at MCD annual reports. the revenues from sales have decreased significantly from 18 billion in the year 2013 to 10 billion in 2018. but the revenue from franchise increase not significantly. I have very few share of MCD. I am thinking if I should sell or wait and see. I know they brought a AI company and introducing technology into their stores. But I don't know how much this technolgoy can help to increase same store sales.any opinions please?

The lines are still long at MCD where ever you go and most of them have been up-dated inside and out. They missed this 3rd quarter a small amount and now the whole bottom drops out because of one analyst view point. I believe the shorts are pushing this down. MCD is still the best fast food restaurant out there for the price and quality of food.

"My analysis and prediction of MCD earnings.Q3 is supposed to be the best quarter because people take vacation and eat a lot at McDonald's. But not this year due to Covid 19. I predict Q3 earnings will be $0.75 to $0.80, below the consensus. The yearly earnings will be $2.50. That makes P/E of 80. The share price needs to be cut in half to reflect the reality. Even P/E of 40 is still too high. But that is what The Fed wants it, to hike the asset price. So be it."
Lololololol

"When will most people realize McDonald's is losing the fast food battle? Everyone else is copying McDonald's 2 for $5, 2 for $4 promotion and has success. Then McDonald's management realized the failure of $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu and came back to to 2 for $5 and 2 for $4 promotion but they found out they had dig a big hold already. Right now almost everyone has the same 2 for $4 and 2 for $5 promotions. The only thing unique is Wendy's 4 for $4. When I need a light lunch, Wendy's is my top choice. Spending $4 on McDonald's $1 $2 $3 Dollar menu almost gets you nothing compared to Wendy's offering. McDonald's management are getting too greedy. They should suffer from it. Let the share price down to $120 this year and let Steve go. He has no new good idea. One hit wonder after the breakfast all day."

McDonald's stock price target raised to $205 vs. $178 today at SunTrust. Stock should be up at least $2 on that news. Yet its down. Hmmm
With market up McD is down?
"looks like a topbut it is hard to call tops, so be carefullikley to go back to 164 or so where it came from 3 weeks ago50 dma is 168100 dma is 164Wall Street is likely using the dow move (index buying, etc) to sell their shares"
"For so many reasons including a historically high PE ratio 26.70, verses MCD's historic range of 10-approx 18, high debt MCD's debt is at 24 billion up 62% since the end of 2014, challenges to margin expansion in fast food and globally people are eating healthier, a very crowded market as there is tremendous competition in fast food, and MCD's falling revenue I have heard several unreasonable reasons for why revenue has been falling, I think it is a red flag for what is potentially in the future. MCD's PE is pricing the company for accelerated growth but this will definitely not happen in the fast food market as people globally are eating less fast food and healthier options and fast food has tight margins. If MCD transitioned to healthier menu options their costs would be much higher, food prep would take longer and sales would be less. Also the US new food guide recommends a plant based diet (the US is MCD's largest market), which means a vegan diet, the new Cdn food guide out in early 2018 is also guiding for a plant based diet, the UN actively promotes for health and other reasons a vegan diet as well...MCD obviously is known for it's burgers/chicken strips and soft serve ice cream the long term trends are not in MCD's favor. No competent analyst would buy MCD at it's current lofty valuation with large uncertainty around new growth of revenue and many risks to the growth inc. as noted competition, healthier trends, ect... It is novice retail investors buying at these prices and speculators."
Ive noticed price increases here and there over the past 6 month but nobody else seemed to notice or care.

"Payless shoes closing 400 stores Bankrupt !!ISM services index drops unexpectedly from last month !AMazon is soaring as online sales soar and people stay at home bad for mcdonalds !Mcdonalds desperate with fresh hamburg will increase costs and could go bad as it will not stay fresh long without freezing increasing costs for stores to maintain !Moments after PMI reported the worst Service PMI since September, the Non-manufacturing ISM also missed, with the headline number dropping from 57.6 to 55.2, the lowest since October, or before the Trump election.There were declines in three of four key components as business activity and new orders dropped, but most notable was the slide in the Employment sub-index which barely avoided contraction, sliding from 55.2 to only 51.6, the lowest since August, and refuting the post-ADP euphoria. Furthermore, a signal that the reflation trade is also over, the Prices Paid index tumbled by the most in 4 years."

"Today’s office $MCD buffet included apple pies for desert. We went with Filet o Fish and McChicken today. No fries. Troops loved the food and we had a great employee update on our new website. 25 attendees, a few folks taking kids back to college."
Had 2 Filet o Fish today. $5. Feel like i stole something $MCD
Let’s keep it above 200 ... thank you
"MCD, by any historical metric, is expensive. It's selling at + 8 X revenues, revenue growth is -1.50%, book value is - $11 per share and the balance sheet is ugly. In addition, commodity and food prices are climbing, national minimum wage of $15 an hour is very possible, and corporate taxes are going up. These are serious headwinds facing MCD and they are going to affect the bottom line. Not only that, growth may prove very elusive."
$219.27 Going once Going twice .......
Nosedive in progress..$200 exit point?

"I like McDonald stock .... but recently i sold my position. This is what bothers me. I was at McDonald's this past weekend to grab breakfast for my girlfriend and i. I walked in and they were not taking orders at the counter rather trying to get people to learn the automated self order kiosk. I tell you this is a nightmare and the people just want to walk in and and get their food and eat. So many people were confused and the staff was trying to help them figure it out, but in reality people were disgusted and walked out. I ordered my food and around 20 to 25 minutes later i finally got my order. When i got home with my food my girl friend asked me what took so long. She probably thought i stopped off for a beer somewhere. You call this fast food. I should of walked across the street to burger king which i did on Sunday and got my food in 2 minutes. McDonald's don't try and re invent the wheel. You are a fast food restaurant not Chili's or Black Angus. Just a FYI i looked over at McDonald's on Sunday as i was going to Burger King and the drive through was like 10 cars deep and people standing inside."

Down over 3%. The Mcflurry machine must be busted again.
Many of the comments are about customers lining up around the building and I would think that this is also in other countries also. What I can not figure out is how MCD dropped almost 4% yesterday or over $8.25. Then see AMC go from $5.00 to over $20.00 along with some other stocks that look like they were ready to fold.
should be 190!
"She looks like she's gonna test $200, no?"

McDonald's always sky rockets before the crash.
Anyone want to buy shares in my company? I have a burger stand and pay out a whopping 66% of all profits in dividends! Im just asking 26X my earnings but you get that DIV. Sure that DIV is only an inflation level 2.5% but thats good right? Paypal me 200$ to buy 0.0000000013089% of my company if interested.
Here comes the selling? Lets see if $209 holds.

I think MCD and OPK are the 2 best stocks out there! People continue to get fast food and OPK is pumping tests during the Pandemic. 400000 kits a day! and maybe millions of burgers a day still .
"MCD can't go down! This stonk is hugging the 50 and outpacing the broader market by 2% while it has no customers. Yeehaw! To the moon, buy at the offer cause the Fed is gonna buy your higher offer no problem!"
Talk about a bloated share price.
BRTX Rocks all next week.
MCD reached a 52 Week low at 145.75
200 incoming?
Hmm. The technicals say MCD looks pretty expensive here at the this current resistance level. Especially being the market is on nervous ground with the whole yield curve thing. Its definitely expensive in my opinion and im definitely not long. No.
NO FEAR IF MCD DIPS again. DISCOUNT BUYERS will continue to bring the price back up and support the stock. 
You can't complain or for that matter tell MCD how good someone is doing at the local McDonalds. First their website say there isn't a McDonalds anywhere near 88061 which isn't so. Our MCD has been great up till a week ago. What use to be lightening fast has turned into a snails pace. My wife loves their Parfaits and a week ago I waited in line and ordered 4 parfaits paid and finally got to the pickup window. Sorry sir we are all out of parfaits. Then it took another 3 minutes to get a refund. Same thing happened tonight but the line was even slower and the refund took even longer. The MCD is a franchise and the owner would call you. Today that doesn't happen. McDonalds what has happened to your customer service???
"50,000,000 dollos te-he-he-te-he ha ha ha ha"

Confused on the new dividend they still pay a dividend right?

"Its a real estate company, not a hamburger company.And its always in the best locations."
Thank you MCD. Made good money today.
"Predictions: how much will the dividend increase this December? I say .06c, to an even $1.00 per quarter. This would be a ~6.25% raise, actually less than the five year avg DGR of 7.4%, but more than the past three years of 5%. Nice round number, 1 buck, with 33.33% price appreciation YTD.. sweeeeet."
"gee, the head of marketing ousted after the end of the quarter. guess what that says for the revenue numbers reported in a coupla weeks? maybe MCD will go to 150 and a pe of 30 since the revenue hit is so bad."
"Mcdonald""s Corp (MCD) President and CEO Stephen Easterbrook Sold $28.9 million of Shareshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonald-corp-mcd-president-ceo-191501041.html"
Folks time to sell here and take your profits before MCD tanks again. Note tat falling revenues is haunting this stock and its not going to get any better. Lower revenues means lower stock pricing. Beware.....

"Jumped in recently @ 143 in this world class company and ready to reload if it falls significantly. Also bought Nestlé, Coke, Microsoft, Google, Twitter Total and Shell."
"Fast food chain workers need to pay more to increase the productivity. My recent two trips to McDonald's and Burger King gives me bad experience. There are only five cars ahead of me but it took more me more than 30 minutes waiting. That is serving 6 minutes per car. When the workers got paid so little, they don't want to work fast. I remember back to 70's and 80's, workers can serve less than 1 minute per customer. Then before Covid 19, my measurement is about 3 or 5 minutes per customer in the dining room. The drive-thru gets worse."
Headed to $210 by end of next week ! Load up NOW !!!
"What the heck happened to $227.. Last I look, now kaboom!!!"
Everywhere I go McDonald's. And there packed morning noon and night This stock should be Mcflying

"Called my local $MCD today, asked them to fill up a 5 gallon pail with ice cream cones and we had what turned into a wet T-shirt contest at the office for all the employees in the call center. Quite shocked when a lot of our ladies went topless after getting covered with chocolate sauce. Had to send them home to change or take PTO. Everyone seemed to have fun. No cameras as we made them leave them on their desks as they’d get them wet and dirty. Thanks $MCD for another great employee event. $400 worth of cones made my gang happy."
"Never mind . . . I just found the historical charts, but once again too much open space to scroll through. VENTING!"
"10 year yield seems to be moving up 2.72 today, was 2.68 yesterday, I thinkshould keep moving up was over 3%2.63 MCD / 2.72 * 183.62 per share => $177 per sharesay the 10 year goes to 32.63/3 * 183.55 now = $161 per share"
Upgraded to $215.00

Msft in negotiations to buy TWTR!MCD's historically backslides to $195 per share.
"I see a lot of people on this board worried about this dip. Folks! This is McDonald's!!! One of the greatest companies across the globe with arguably the most successfully enduring brand. This dip is completely unjustified and--although the CEO made a personal judgement against policy--one man doesn't make this company. It was here before him and it'll be here after him. So if you're already in at higher prices and you bought on margin, HOLD ON. It'll easily recover from these bargain prices before your margin call period expires. However, if you've got the cash, BUY NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. As far as I'm concerned, I'm putting my money where my mouth is: I picked up another 140 shares between 188.30 and again at 188. GLTYA. (I hope you take this for the early X-mas/Khanukkah gift it is--it might even help you pay for those gifts, lol.)"
Buy it and never sell it ; it will be 190 within six months; if tomorrow goes down because of a down market it is a gift
"I thought amazon was bad for not allowing employees to take sick days, or breaks, but now we see how mcd's is colluding with other fast food outlets in anti poaching agreements. all over the world, companies are exploiting workers, while management gets ten of millions in pay and bonuses. this is why socialism is great. all these companies get taken over by the state, and the shareholders who profit from exploited workers lose their investment."

PE 22.56 is a 20% drop from therea company with an 8% growth rate might deserve a PE of 16, not 22.56The buybacks are not real growth. They might only have about a 5% growth even before the effect of the buybacks, which would suggest they have a growth of about half of that, 2.5%. It seems safe to assume that MCD will drop below the 50 dma, which is 201.7. $177 is a real possibility. the employment report (ADP) was low, less jobs created"

I have been watching people Online taste test & review the MCD PLT beyond meat burger in Canada. Very positive reviews.
May have to buy the dip and grab the dividend this week.
Just read the recent Business-week Article on McDs...I was impressed with the changes and the profitablity....but couldn't help but to notice the fall in Revenues in the last 4 years from $25B to $20B expected this year. Business is shrinking....yet the stock has doubled in that time. Shouldn't that be a real concern?

"Office $MCD lunches suspended until 2021. Could hurt 4th quarter. We spend about $50,000 per annum on this employee benefit."
I personally would be much more concerned if the CFO was departing. MCD has been through many CEO's in the past few years so just cuz some one does a Jeff Bezos on us and can't keep it zipped is no big deal. Unlike a company that is cooking the books! This is a buying opportunity and ignore the idiot analysts that say otherwise! This is McDonald's for pete's sakes and the holidays are just around the corner!
Just jumped in today as I think this is an attractive entry point. MCD is one of the few stocks that will thrive in a recession. I've also been noticing drive thru lines have been fairly long and consistent....they're doing something right.

McD’s trend of declining revenues is the elephant in the room most everyone ignores as profits and dividends have kept rising - somewhat fueled by borrowing to repurchase stock . Unless the revenue trend substantially reverses the “chicken nuggets “will eventually come home to roost . A declining revenue trend is NOT a mark of a thriving business .

"Burger King had poultry supplied by one of the companies raided recently by Ice. Was it Koch Foods or Peco. Anyway, Burger King is mostly owned by 3G based in Brazil. So we have a company based outside the United States, enjoying the tax rules, safety, and way of life, and exploiting us by hiring people who don't have social security cards. Hiring people not even screened at the border. Hiring people they don't know why they came here. Hiring people from another land, and putting Americans out of work. Out of work Americans means more taxes to pay for their benefits. People, these companies are using the government to subsidize their low pay. Its companies like these that gives America a black eye. I'm hoping these companies pay humongous fines, and I hope they have to pay the people who were detained and or fired, to make up for the exploitation these employees suffered. Hopefully the fine they pay to the government, is used to fund more ice raids, and to fund more of the wall. Lets get all our people to work, raise their living wage, and then work on employing the rest of the world."

And they spent an equivalent to their earngins on buybacks. Who does that at the top?Its being manipulated by MCD it seems as weill as all the pumpers in the fake news here on yahoo finance mcd.They all seem to be pushing hard to take the share price up.So they can sell at higher prices.

mcdonalds food is poison but then again so is nearly all fast food. research what you put into your body folks. study labels and you will realize your being poisoned
Does anyone think MCD will split soon?
McD shorts to the tune of 10 million shares better cover soon
Down over $8 Ah. Wow whet happens?
If you think those wages going up is gonna help you out your wrong. Every time wages go up your food bills go up. Your still stuck in the same boat.

"Franchisees used PPP loans to pay MCD rents. It is not sustainable. Once PPP loans run out, MCD Chicago headquarters will either foreclose these stores or eat the loss by themselves."
"Kiosk and table services are terrible. People stop loving it. Every time I went to McDonald's in the past four months, I saw a lot of angry customers. They have to wait 20 to 30 minutes to get their food. Lots of people just left because late for the work. They call McDonald's slow food chain."
I dont think this stock should have gone below 206 from 220 for it to go under 200 is not a safe stock anymore
IN MY OPINION ONLY AN INCIDENT HAPPENED TODAY. I WENT TO MCDONALDS FOR DINNER. THIS PARTICULAR MCDONALDS IS LOCATED NEXT TO MY GYM. IT IS A CONVENIENT LOCATION. I ORDERED DINNER FOR MYSELF AND MY WIFE. THE ORDER CONSISTED OF AN ANGUS BURGER DEAL AND A GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD. I PLACED THE ORDER AT THE INTERCOM. PROCEEDED TO THE FIRST WINDOW AND PAID FOR THE PURCHASE. PULLED FORWARD TO THE SECOND WINDOW FOR THE PICKUP AND WAS TOLD THE CHICKEN SALAD WAS NOT AVAILABLE. I QUESTIONED WHY SINCE I HAD PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR THE ITEM AND ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER.THE MANAGER WAS RUDE AND RACIST. I WAS TOLD TO CANCEL THE ORDER AND LEAVE IN AN ANGRY MANNER.IT WAS VERY EMBARRASSING.I CALLED THE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS TO INFORM THEM OF THIS PROBLEM.
2.4 PEG ratio for a fast food company? Seems overpriced to me. This should trade back to the $145 level at best.
"PE 27 way way too highits worsebuybacks $5B, earningns $6, about the samePE would be over 50, around 54 without the buybacks, I believenow look at growht, none it seems"

MCD is the trade here / 2.50% divy looks great with 10yr 1%
I love MCD as a stock and a restaurant. Love the Whopper there

Buy the dip now itll be back up by afternoon
MY COST IS 74.00 so I am just very pleased with Mcd’s and their good div. I have had it or 15 yrs.
Interesting...just stumble on DIN (Dine equity....IHOP and Appleby's ...yuk!). Their stock has been similar to MCD....$75-$95 in a few months. Noticed many food stocks have been acting in bull fashion........DIN may be a great SHORT like MCD..................their customers are generally lower class/middle patrons. Guess those jobs have helped fuel taking the family out to #$%$ IHOP now and then?
Why such a drop when market up? MCD's is considered as somewhat a safe haven with good yield and a burger that can't be avoided/
Some rag put out a piece that MCD traffic was slower than expected this qtr....per CNBC....but my $160 puts just jumped!!!.
220 after earnings
Loved the spicy chicken sandwich. Opted out of the combo because I am too white. Maybe you should consider another vendor like Pepsi. I come to enjoy the food not get preached at by vendors who’s product literally gets flushed down the toilet within 30 minutes of consuming it.
Long MCD!Can’t wait for McPlant!
I HATE this new format. Why so much open space and moving things to distract us?
The only company going up today; buy all you can easy 190 safely
$ 125 today but maybe the drop will slow.
Sell bunch of garbage
Like AAPL due to make $203.00
I believe this stock should split and I know a lot of new investors would jump on the band wagon with a lower price so they could get a decent amount of shares. It has been a long time since this stock split and it is long overdue.
Still very expensive imo.
What fools are buying McDonald!s Never seen markets so out of function ever. Blame world governments manipulating rates to next to zero and also Europe to negative 3 to 4%. This is why whole system is corrupt to chase money into stock markets for a return of positive. Blame the FED for again lowering rates to below normal to play same game. This has been happening back and forth for last 11 years to manipulate and control markets etc. Also to hold up ridiculous housing prices with below normal rates. This is why this whole system needs to collapse period.Make these fools pay up.s
Motley Fools issued a false release that McDonald was going to increase the dividend when that is not true.
FLUSH YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET GENIUSES!
MCD can easily slip and test $156.50 again. The bounceback of the stock market only concentrates on a small number of momo stocks. It is not healthy.
Why does MCD have so much debt
Hamburger is more expensive than an iPhone! This is incredible!
"When someone is selling,someone is buying"
"Just sold made a nice profit. New ceo, did not make earnings the last two years during this quarter.Need to make 2.7% more this quarter. That is why I am out. Will watch and make decision after earnings."
"As I still say, $160 by Labor Day..."
Is McDonald making a deal with beyond meat??
It's over but the cryin for Mickey D. This was the top of all tops for them.
WT....F
Another day of getting hammered for this thing
"Why is MCD like another $450M possibly fake painting ?Just like the art dealers the analysts have constantly upgraded MCD target price over the course of this year despitethe the company losing sales for the last 5 years and due mainly to stock buybacks sinking the company so far into debt ($27B) that its book value is now almost minus $5 per share .They beat earnings in Q3 only by selling their Chinese restaurants without that $850M , earnings would have been terribleAt least the painting could be unique unlike MCD shares which have 810 million looking for some sucker to buy them when the bidding auction stops and the funds start to finally unload .Beware CALPERS when they unload over 30% of their equity portfolio soon"
1st half 2020 will be painful. Can they service their debt?
"McDonald's is dishonest . How many fries should I get when I order a large fry ? How many fries should I get when I order a medium fry? …..When I order a large fry , the amount of fries should not be able to fit in a medium size cup . They cheat customers on drive thrus. Scam company ."
market manipulation is always part if the game. Price drops or pullback allow for the market to reach newer high. I am long mcd.
I am shocked that this stock stayed green all day.
"I love going to McDonalds for a quick meal. Their chicken sandwich off the dollar menu is excellent. By the way, I don't own stock in this corp."
chicken restaurant EL Polo Loco is tanking AH ! (LOCO) look I dare you !
"Cost of Revenue 2,614,400 2,611,200 2,674,700 2,937,100With a large increase in the minimum wage these cost amounts are false. Investors are stupid people."
"just closed my position, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, you guys are betting on not much lower this stock can go, you could be right but I don't have the time to waste on this."
"Yes we are getting our butts kicked right now, but MCD will get back up and get some pay back. Those of you making the argument about the stock being overvalued seem to think that the current market is following the rules. In a perfect market, this is true, follow the numbers. I can make the same argument for all the undervalued stocks and look where they are; AT&T, AMD, etc. Shorts are selling on mediocre news driving the premium down. Weather the storm, the price will go back up because it is freaking McDonalds."
I don't understand why this stock always sells off when it reaches a new high.
"I feel the market took it up with manipulation, knowing shorts would enter after the dividend payout, and because they want to get out themselves. While I was involved the volume was very low. Up on low volume."
I can’t believe how dead this has been for the past couple of weeks.
Not sure why this is up? Not making sense.

"i had puts prior to the earnings, lost 100%"
"Recently, McDonalds introduced some recipes that eliminated artificial flavors. They are to be commended. For you see, when you see the Term ""artificial flavors"", you should not buy the product. Often times, its one of 6 artificially created flavorings, that the FDA recently banned from our food supply. After letting many companies use the for years, in order to make an extra small amount of money. The FDA. The best friend the food industry ever had. Perhaps the worst enemy we consumers could have. But at least McD's is doing something. And every once in a while, they do make a good move. But sadly, for years, they were doing things they probably shouldn't have been doing."
mark my words. will go down after earnings.
I want the ceo to answer how many fries are you supposed to get whe you order a large fry ? When I’m hungry I want what I pay for !!!!
$10 billion? Give every splib a share and ship them out of the country!

"MCD drive through is packed, even with double queues. It’s a good pandemic Business... hope we beat this virus and get back to normal. Stay strong y’all, and God bless America!"
"$MCD Filet o Fish looks overpriced. Keeps getting smaller too. Maybe switch to carp from pollock. $OESX has some carp harvesting equipment under development. Could be a great margin enhancer and their market cap is only ~ $100mm so cheap deal, as it should be."
Seems when the market goes up MCD goes down. It actually makes it a great defensive stock. When it hit the fan in 2008-9 MCD didnt skip a beat. It's the only individual stock I own and I've rebaught several times since it was at $84
DOWN GOES FRAZIER!!!!!!!!!
"As the market grinds higher, people look for laggards which are being harmed by current events but do not have any systemic issues. IMO, MCD will recover when vaccines are readily available so this ticker is WHEN, not IF. I sell bull put verticals when it dips."
I have just performed my advanced Modigliani technical analysis and this is indicating McDonald’s to 265
"Up every week since 1/1/17.....only a moron would buy this here!!! Heck, almost EVERY target price by every analyst is BELOW where it is now!!! Just a low VIX and computers chasing....when it breaks it will be violent and swift!!!!!!!! Also, MACD line ready to cross to the downside!!!!!"

MCD desperately needs a potato-less french fry to accompany the meatless hamburger. Channel checks indicate customer traffic is down. Please trade accordingly.

"Today while dining at McDonald's, I saw an angry man arguing with his friend who tried to calm him down. He said he supports Trump and will never watch NFL again. He also said a lot of bad things about black people that I don't want to repeat here. This issue will divide our nation even worse IMO because there is no good solution in sight."

"153 is the 52 week lowmcd has been moving up up up for over a year, even 3 years and has gotten above its growth rate, far above itit might have a 5% growth rateit might have a 7.8% growth rate (according to some analysts)new stores 3.5%PE over 28.2I believe the inflation numbers in the US are incorrect, as food and fuel need to be included. And I believe there could be a turn whereas the US sees high inflation, mostly due to the excessive creation of money diluting the value of money. There are huge foreign holdings of treasuries and things can change fast. I feel MCD has not been protecting MCD for years, as they do buybacks and divy out dividends. The article here on yahoo finance says they paid out 73% of their cash flow as dividends or buybacks. Read the article to verify what I have said, perhaps I misunderstood it.Though MCDs is certainly doing a lot of business, I don't feel that the stock should have gone from 110 to 213, up 94% in 3 years, when growth may only be 5%, or even 7.8%. And with them spending 73% of cash flow on buybacks and dividends, the growth certainly is being manipulated to look more than it would be without this excessive misappropriation of funds. http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&insttype=Stock&symb=mcd&x=44&y=10&time=10&startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&enddate=6%2F2%2F2019&freq=1&compidx=aaaaa%3A0&comptemptext=&comp=none&ma=3&maval=50&uf=0&lf=1&lf2=2&lf3=4&type=4&style=320&size=4&timeFrameToggle=false&compareToToggle=false&indicatorsToggle=false&chartStyleToggle=false&state=11Also, note insiders have been selling and have done no buying."

a pe of 23 on a stock that is barely growing if at all is fundamentally ridiculous. the real price is around 100 if that only because of the dividend.
I'm expecting a pretty nice run from here into earnings in the next few weeks.
"Even after the firing of Easterbrook, it appears this new CEO is quite competent. I am looking forward to riding MCD's journey to $300 a share."

MCD is a great buy and will gradually come back. When it went over $220 then came down quickly many investors then questioned the stock's value. It's earnings will continue to improve each year and the stock will go up 10 to 20% I predict in 2020.

Consumers are trading down from fast casual to fast food as fast food traffic increased 5% faster in 1H. McDonald's has 36% share $MCD
$184.50 and $180 are the support pivots. As long as it stays above that for at least 5 days this will probably jump about 8% from where it is now.

MCD pumped so high
"Apparently there was a selloff today. Somehow, I didn’t notice. $FB, $NVDA, $MU, $MCD"
This is #$%$ junk a hightech company with such a high PE?

A little overbought now. Time to take a little profits.

Messages on this board remind me of 2000 when I hung on too long just before the first bubble burst and lost a ton of moneyyou bulls should do well to take a look at this chart and ask yourself where is this sales increase the scam analysts are touting In 2008/9 MCD only had 4 quarters of shrinking sales in the last 4 years it now has 19 quarters of shrinking sales https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/key-statistics/
"Investors sold shares of Mcdonald’s Corp (NYSE:MCD) on strength during trading on Monday after an insider sold shares in the company. $78.42 million flowed into the stock on the tick-up and $151.78 million flowed out of the stock on the tick-down, for a money net flow of $73.36 million out of the stock.

$7 drop..this thing cant get traction at all
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/low-book-value-misleading-154750285.htmlMCD would be like Qualcom in 1. Why does it have negative book value?
203 hit.
This stock deserves better treatment
"I am up 515% on my MCD position, yeuhoo! I worked there as a teenager, my first job flipping and searing burgers. I made $3.15 an hour and felt amazingly independent. It’s good to know MCD is still going strong and has gone global. Just make sure to not over eat and get plenty of excercise."
"SHAM, stock is dropping for no reason"
"in terms of earnings MCD might be 6.5 times too high of a priceearnings x 4 / price = .044% returnPE 26I don't care about same store sales, besides they weren't up 26%"
We have been in a slump the past few weeks. Time for some upward movement.
balance sheet suckslike us balance sheet
I Have watched MCD stock for years. It's definitely on sale so I am starting a position Monday morning.
"$3.00 dollars down in one DAY-- out for drive--stop at Mcd --no we went to B.K.----2 for $6.00 add 2 shakes---no fat fries , Mothers dont let dad take your child to a NFL game -not safe--- when its gone -its gone , no come back---"

Anonymous is a moron 
"Most Americans who don't use food stamps will buy necessary grocery, cook by themselves to conserve their cash at hand. They won't go to McDonald's even the drive thru is open. That is the cruel reality in America. And it will become much more clear in the end of April. People need to stretch their cash to cover their food until the end of summer if not beyond 2020. Death toll will reach 100,000 or 240,000 as President Trump predicted. If you haven't given Uncle Sam your saving account number already through IRS refund process before, the emergency $1,200 check will arrive after five weeks from now. Those came to McDonald's drive thru won't come back again because they cannot afford it."
Stock was a strong sell at $226.65
just picked up 50 shares. This is looking oversold
oil stocks are cheaper
long term debt and liabilities growing out of controllooks like netflix
McDonald's is going nowhere and by that I mean they're here to stay It pays a two and a half percent dividend. this is a stock to hold for your children and your grandkids
When is the dividend?
and down she goes
"Company buffet today included $MCD McDoubles and also blue and yellow milkshakes for the Brewer playoff game here in Wisconsin again today. Tried the mobile order on the app, wonder if biggest mobile order in history?"
Is any client going to stop going to MCD because........... ?I don't think so...........They have clients like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates......
"Down again, and it even got an upgrade today"
MCD has no real competitors on a global scale

I think I can see MCD doing great for many centuries.

"the dividend and yield on the 10 year treasury note are about equal all of a suddenthe 10 year is fed tax freeMCD is about to #$%$ outearnings is July 26, I think, debt bubble, the consumer is burned out on interest expenses"
"I take your point and appreciate (always) contrarian views?. The dopamine rush from us ?geniuses? who predicted the Bull following the Covid collapse of 2020, seems to have hypnotized most of us into the belief that the party will continue ad infinitum. This has occurred despite $ 30 trillion in debt (over 100% of gdp) & markets expecting companies to beat market expectations & dropping value if they only beat market expectations by 10% or less. I get that some increase in markets is due because companies are thriving yada blah blah blah blah blah. I remember reading the Intelligent Investor (a book worth reading) and thinking ? holy #$%$ is picking stocks like gambling?? Of course it is. Two things I have learned (some the hard way). Predicting markets based on technical indicators is BS, mainly because predicting markets based upon retrospective data, particularly using small data, is hypothesis generating at best and must be tested prospectively to hypothesis test. Second, the assumption that any combination of variables can reliably predict performance of a stock assumes that historically situations like those occurring now have happened before. Since stock markets have been around for ~300 years and conditions have changed so much over that time. conclusions are ludicrous"
"lots of issues in china, esp food safety issues..good strategy to get out before their equity gets slammed again... chicken flu is starting to spread in china, before you know they will ban chickens again like in 2013"
Trump will prove McDonald's French fries can save him from Covid 19. Then everybody wants to buy McDonald's French fries because of its secret ingredients which not cure baldness but also Covid 19.
those that do not sell a stock with a real or tangible book value of just $1.47 per share when despite all hype that MCD has had both sales growth and earnings growth is show to be just a pack of lies according to figures on yahoo finance will lose their shirt when it crashes under heavy selling volume
And when the bubble pops MCD will be dishing it up to the longs!
is this a growth stock? Why such a HIGH pe?
I am having a craving for Big Mac today :)
ex-dividend date 2/28 also.
"I use to eat at McDonalds five or six times a week. Now maybe 4. And my friend use to eat the same but, he just died of a heart attach last week so he is down to near zero."
My advanced Modigliani technical analysis is still indicating McDonald’s to 255
"They should use Dragontail systems in order to improve their deliveries like Yum brands, Dominos, and Burger king (soon). As well they can monitor Covid 19 stuff safety."
"With a lot of investors predicting an up ward swing to close to $200.00 dollar,s it sure would be nice to see a 2 for 1 split an double that upward swing in real dollars."
"all MCD needs to do is cut prices about 10 percent, and the competition will look expensive. Fast food is a thin margin business."
If some corporations are trading at 100x EPS. like amazon. Then Mcdonald’s should be valued at over $700 a share.
"CONGRATS IF YOU BOUGHT THE MARCH 2020 $195 CALLS ON DISCOUNT WHEN THEY WERE IN THE $5s. They are over $7 now. Continue to accumulate cheaper on dips, AHEAD OF THE JANUARY EARNINGS release."
I blame the McRib for this drop.
MCD UPGRADED to $235.00 !!!!

I agree with Jack. Good opportunity to buy.
It’s showing really defensive in this current market
I bought more :) now
The most crowded McDonald's in town reopened in May. Used to have more than 10 people in line then became 2 or 3. Last week the store is shut down again. McDonald's and most restaurants are dead because people now only want to eat meals self-made.
folks take a look at shrimp (SHMP) today !! Market loving shrimp !!
Companies like McDonald's and American Airline that used debt to buy back shares in the past three years will be the most vulnerable. Analysts will point fingers in the next few weeks to identify these irresponsible companies. The top managers hiked their share prices by deep into debt. Now they will pay the price. American Airlines has been cut in half. McDonald's will be the next.
Breaking news. Another CEO Easterbrook's defeat. He will phase out Signature Craft Burgers because very few people pay $6 for a burger at McDonald's. He has been trying all different ways to boost McDonald's revenue by forcing customers to pay more. So far his success rate is 0%.
Why the big hit on MCD today?
"All time MCD high again unfolds, it pays to recall why we holdIn bull markets and when the sky is falling, 43+ years of increasing divs keep calling."
Analysts upgrades $240-$250
"great Seeking Alpha article Kody's Dividends11% overvalued -> $178 per share52 week range $153 to $201;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;7 to 8% yield to me says PE 16 is double and the PE is 2616/26 * 200 per share => $123 per share, not considering the dividendthe 10 year treasury yield is in the dirt, so suddenly MCD has something to offer, but only starting from a fair price like $178 per share"
"Most people in drive thru drove away before ordering. Did the headquarters try to solve the problem? Even you mobile order, you still need to wait the long line to get your food. Because you already paid so you have to wait in line, but they will never come back the second time.Drive thru is not working."
there will be no chance to invest in such a cool company for another 20 years. I'm buying
Up $8.12. I'm lovin it!
Howwwww. Lowwwwww can you goooooooo
Fish Filet is tiny vs. BK.
On the news white people stopped eating at McDonalds because of McDonalds RACIST policies
"Stock should be at $5. I stopped at a McDonalds this past weekend after not eating there in 2 years. No I know why, food was #$%$, way overpriced with #$%$ service to boot. You can have this dog......."
"Recently, I was told Mc Donalds is going back to using fresh beef for their quarter pounders. That's a good thing.No if we can get them to use beef that wasn't fed using GMO Frankenstein grain, or beef that didn't use growth hormones or antibiotics, then we would really have something."
I have never seen McDonald's so empty before. They need to reverse $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu. People hate the new Dollar Menu so they stop visiting McD.
Nobody eats McDonald’s anymore it’s chick fil a now !!
"MCD is the best all weather stock to own. I am glad I’ve not sold this gem over the years, and reinvested the dividends. At some point, I will start dividend payouts and buy toys and travel more... I worked there as a young man, my first job, have good memories!"
"Time to burn the day shorts , they are frustrating this stock and keep it from going higher. PUNKS !!"
People have to eat somewhere.. and why not at a place you can trust
Is it time to make a move on MCD? It certainly looks like it based on a EPS estimate for next year of 6.62. if you guys have questions you should ask awesome-STOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
Please mute anonymous he keeps posting nonsense and McDonald’s is doing great and it will hit 200 dollars per share before not very long
Did you say 200? Hahaha!
"10 year yield 2.799%mcd dividend 2.67%2.67/2/799 * 177.2 => $169 per share valueand its worsethey seem to be borrowing money to give it away (dividends)don't borrow to pay dividends, duhand buybacks push the PE to look lower, but its really high"
"The food blows, but stock has done great since I. Ought it in 2011"
"I find that if I sleep in the $MCD dumpster near my house, I get some nice warm food for free occasionally, which is nice,"
"market cap plus $39B debt = $195B5.9B incomePE adding in the debt is 33operating income up 2.2% yoyborrowing money for buybacks and dividends is sick, working harder ot push their stock prices up than running the business"
Taking the entire office to $MCD for breakfast and coffee in the morning to tell them we are selling the company. Called the manager and he will have cherry pies ready as well. All employees are owners and now millionaires. Go long on Mickey D
Why would anybody short the best restaurant company before their dividend? This stock will hit 190 very very soon

This has been so stuck and level. Time for someUpward action! May the longs be with you!!!
"5%, 7% seems more like the average for the 10 year treasury yieldMCD is paying $1.26B a year now, I believe, based on 2.63% interest rateshttps://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Ywhat if the 10 year goes to 4%5%If MCD has to renew their loan arrangements in the 10 year is twice as high, they may have to pay 5% a year or so interest, $2.5B per year or so interestThings got crazy in the debt departmentThere was a three year period (or so) when the debt doubled.The national debt may see the straw that broke the camels back some day as the debt keeps going up, and they keep letting the debt ceiling get broke. Foreigners are turning away from the dollar, and will turn hard. Its feasible to see interest rated go north in a big way, like back to the 15% years, as the dollar gets rebuffed."
why did it go up today. same with chipotle.
"so far, so goodmaybe sell before earningsbuy a week beforewatch the ex dividend date"
"Time for a class action lawsuit, not only against management, but any organization that handles this stock.This stock has been dropping for weeks, which tells me that this was known by insiders et. al. well before they made it public yesterday.It's not coincidence, and it's not ""disappointing"" earnings that has caused this to drop so far recently, this was well known in advance by anyone on the inside, which includes financial companies, company insiders, etc...Furthermore, Easterbrook, in servicing his pickle, violated the fiduciary duty owed to shareholders, and compensation should be paid to anyone who sustained a loss."
"A substantial break below 208, gets you down in the 190 area... not acting well for some time now...fyi"
"Never thought I would buy MCD, $187.61, only 132 shares. Technology advancements to improve the brand still in place, one man's infidelity is irrelevant."
just went to a chicfila today that line was so long we waited 1 hour in the drive through. Mcdonalds is barely busy.
Uxin online sales and car delivery in China Uxin is the one!
MCD is down 6.28% to 186.37

am i correct to say that this stock has nothing to do with mcd in china?
Time to sell.
"20:23. The LORD detest differing weights , and dishonest scales do not please him . Thank you Lord Jesus that you hate dishonest scales . You detest those that use dishonest weights for ill gotten gain . Thank you Jesus that you see it all no matter how small . The wicked are never satisfied with their wickedness . They love the darkness dear Lord Jesus and they make a mockery out of goodness . Please Father , in the name of your Son Jesus I ask you send them thick darkness and gloom . Cover them with the darkness of pestilence and trembling . Let them not get away with their evil schemes . In Jesus name I pray."
McDonald’s will never be the most tasty food or the best service restaurant; if that’s what you want go somewhere else. But it will be good food at reasonable price with a company with huge economies of scale; and also the fastest service
Wish $MCD would serve a shrimp burger. Mix of cocktail sauce and mayo with seasoned fries.
We boycott MCD because they serve Coca Cola. Get woke. Go broke.
LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY:Mr14 hours agoCONGRATS IF YOU GOT THE STOCK/CALLS DIRT CHEAP. Maybe we take out $160 tomorrow or next week. Easy money. NO FEAR of buying MCD cheaper.BOOM!
It started with one McDonald's employee from Malaysia then he spread Covid 19 to other McDonald's employees in the dorm. Then they spread to customers in drive-thru (lobby has been closed). Then Singapore infection cased jump from under 50 daily to above 2000 daily. This was the big news in the week around 4/12. But in USA it was mentioned momentarily and moved on to other news. Nobody seems cared that restaurants can spread Covid 19 easily even they take precautions. The second wave that started at McDonald's hit Singapore hard will repeat itself in USA.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-mcdonalds-employees-diagnosed-outlets-close-12635516
"People might be underappreciating the effect of tax reductions on consumer spending. Besides the direct tax reduction that McDonald's will pay, there's the increased spending by its customers. That's a profit double-whammy."
"some article referred to mcd as a value stocklook at the debt on the balance sheet, long term debtits growing like a California wildfireborrow money to give it away (dividend)"
"I don't like that CNN and NPR keep saying that Blacks and LatinX are much more likely to have COVID-19. This is causing people to stay away from Black and LatinX business, because they are saying the risk of interacting with a Black person or a LatinX person puts one at much higher risk. They are basing this totally on surface skin color. It is racist and is hurting McDonalds and companies that have to employ a lot of minorities. Stop emphasizing skin color, that is racist and far too simplistic CNN and NPR. Treat people based on their actions. We are all one race. We are all red inside. Oppose discriminatory laws like reverse discrimiation (affirmative action) and anti-racism (which is reverse racism and still racist), oppose special treatment based on skin color. Laws giving racial preference usually backfire."
They need to put up a Racist button you can pick for companies like McDonalds
Another day trading above $220.00
John get a life and get off this fake stock exchange website
Ge is fighting and that’s great to see. I have a small position and will watch them run into 2020 with momentum. Mcd is strong. The drive throughs are always packed and I’m lovin’ it.
I've got to get some of the spicy nuggets.. up nearly 60% in 5 months since last buy..not too shabby!
"This stock blows,"
"I'm still seeing MCD drive-thru lines that wrap around the restaurants. I've gotta believe they're going to blow away their EPS estimate of .47 come July 28th, when they report their earnings."
Advanced modigliani technical analysis (never fails) shows the stock to reach 200 easily within 3 months
This thing is going to $240
CONGRATS if you loaded JUNE CALLS much cheaper. KEEP YOUR DRY POWDER ready to accumulate cheaper on pullbacks.
junk food stores will go to trash
McDonald’s will reach 200 in a couple months; I perform advanced Modigliani technical analysis and that shows the data points very clearly
Why the stock is falling?
The real shame is that this stock continues its upward trajectory when we all know it’s cancer in a bag. Welcome to the good old USA. Same reason markets haven’t ranked when they have every reason to. America’s #1 job: keep the sh t show rolling at all costs. I’d duck after this so called democracy stuff happens in November 
"VETS will march on MCD-------not good--VETS - leg missing , foot missing , blind with service dog-------------------------cant win a war with America"
"Even revenue for the quarter totaled $6.05 billion, down from $6.27 billion last year, McDonald's managed to beat the earnings estimate by 8 cents. I hope there is no funny accounting here. But congratulations to longs. I thought this quarter MCD can no longer beat the earnings estimate after diminishing revenues quarter after quarter. But somehow CEO is able to pull this off."
Is over folks within 5 years mcdonalds is bankrupt thats right in 5 years their won't be any more mcdonalds wendys is taking over not that they serve breakfast sandwiches i tried wends breakfast and its better than mcdonalds by a large margin so get your egg mccfuffin while you can mcdonalds days are numbered.

"trade deal, no trade dealthe 100 dma is 184value maybe 188 based on the dividend, but the debt is stupidand the buybacks are manipulation and taking the debt to the moon"
"Had the new fresh beef quarter pounder. What a improvement! I don't care about their stupid stock, their Big Macs are awesome and so is the quarter pounder. I gave this chick a quarter pounder of my #$%$. She loved it. McDonald inspired me to put pickles and onions on my balls. She likes that #$%$ so good. I got my own special sauce baby!"
This is a complete trash
"To the moon. Be surprised we don’t see that 180 prediction by Thanksgiving. They are popping. Tenders are like AMD video cards, you can’t find them they selling out. Seschuan sauce craze coming back. 200 by EOY?"
"what is up with McDonalds high level of debt, please someone explain. Thank you."
2pm dump coming..like clockwork
McD is American! Americans want and need infrastructure bill passed...and when it does...oh! those hungry workers. Happy meals and Happy days ahead. McD is a bargain. Buy! Buy! Buy!
Still shows weakness at colsing that is giving signal that is more downside. When it goes up at closing that is sign to consider covering short position
"$MCD under $209! Keep collecting, projected for $300+ next year."
McDonald's is King.
"MCD's debts is larger than the Asset, The share holder value is negative, just be careful."
Mcdonalds is at the 200 day average. should bounce because technical traders get excited about it. buti think you can buy lower in future. not much growth for 26 multiple. competition is too fierce.
"a lot of stocks are Wall Street trading toysthey trade irregardless of value MCD worth $106 to $159, Seeking Alpha and my comparison to the 10 year yield at 3% (soon, and it will go higher)what about buying fast food going into a recessionwe are in a recession already, the data will show so later"
"Will be red soon, upgrade means less down today"
You would be an IDIOT to buy when this is $20+ ABOVE the 50 day average and the dollar at 52 week highs!! This WILL retrace back towrds the 50 day average....it ALWAYS DOES!! 50 day average at $169.....heck...SHORT until the low $180's is still a great trade!!!!!!!! I am SHORT 1000 shares with a stop at $190.
"Gorgeous Gals tend to eat a lot of McDonald's. The Prettier they are, the more McDonald's they eat. I think a woman who eats a lot of McDonald's is very s-xy."
"If the alleged sales miss is due to the hurricanes as they suggest, then it will be a short lived blip and the train will continue onward. Nice chance to buy. Plus should be announcing dividend increase soon."
Should I be worried by the drop?
As an investor I'm disgusted by their Trump tweet. Way to alienate half the country.They need to find out who tweeted that out and fire them.

"There seems always stuff going on around the world.... the best way to invest in my opinion is to buy businesses that have been around for decades, and still irk out a sensible profit year in, year out. Look no further, MCD is it."
McDonalds to close 200 restaurants.
"I worked at McD as a teen in early 1980s. A great 1st job experience and fond memories. Been a long term shareholder. It's a good time to add MCD shares here IMO and collect a sensible dividend. Over the long run McDonald's stock should go up. It's hard to compute what their real estate holding is worth nowadays. It's a quick sensible meal at a decent price. As a travel abroad often, I am seeing McDonalds everywhere - Sweeden, Denmark, Normay, UK, Hong Kong,..."
Trying to buy a Signature Crafted sandwich in local McDonald's last night. They said they don't have it any more because VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE BUYING THEM. I cannot believe signature crafted sandwiches lost the novelty so soon. That is why McD launches the new Dollar Menu in 2018.
"McD CRASHES again! ""Paging Mr. Madoff, Mr. Bernie Madoff, you have serious competition."""
"McDonald's ignores vegetarians and vegans for decades even while Burger King has had a veggie burger for 18 years and now has an even better one, the Impossible Whopper. Finally, McDonald's makes a veggie burger. Because they care about their clientele? Nope. Market share. #$%$ McDonald's."
People who’s still getting food from restaurants have no idea how serious the virus is. I haven’t bought any ready-to-eat foods from outside for a month and will keep doing so until there’s a treatment to the virus.

If I was CEO of $MCD I would be worried about completion from A&W. Art and Wally are prepared to expand aggressively and $MCD should be the target.
Mcd needs to stop worrying about their foamPackaging and start announcing how they’ll spend tax cut money so we can participate in this rally with the other 98% of stocks. Are we going to sit it out this week too?!
Short? Or buy the dip?
noone can take this down.
"The management are stupid. The current dividends are supported by debt. Even the debt is cheap because of the low interest rate, it is not sustainable and a bad way to use debt. Why do the management want to support the stock price at this level? They need to cut the dividends to the level they can support by the earnings not by the new borrowing debt. Otherwise it will be ugly when the bubble bursts."
C’mon $200

No longer a safe haven trade. People are buying the risk assets.
MCD's revenue decreased by 30% over the last 5 years. It rack up 27Billions debts during the same time. Yet its market cap increased from 90 Billions to more than 160 Billions. Such is the reality of today's stock market!

"MCDs is KOs biggest customer, hows that boycott going , LOL."
So McDs just lost their contract with McCormick. All seasoning and flavoring is now coming from another company. Wonder if tastes are going to change.
"McDonald's has approx 34,000 restaurants in 118 countries around the world, serving more than 69 million people every day! That's everyday and you are talking about the stock like what, get a grip!"
Do you like me now
BOOM! TOLD you shorts yesterday that MCD would hit $160 today or next week. 
Keep printing money no one has the gold to back it up!
Looks like lower Revenues and lower Operating Incomes.If it wasn't for accounting tricks (like buying back stock) earnings would also look bad. McD's is still contracting and this thing can fall far before it hits bottom.
"Something does not add up - apart from the question about the quality/offering by what is in effect a fast food takeaway, Valuation PER OUTLET (pls don't call it Restaurant) is $9.6 Mio, this is insanity, Revs per outlet 2.15 Mio, that is in line with many restaurants, Net just 130k, also roughly in line, restaurants ARE NO GOLD MINE in the best of times, compare this to $MCD, McDonalds, that is bit problematic comparision as it is a franchise model, but still, val per outlet 3.6 Mio, highish but after all there is a strong franchise with long track record, sales per outlet basically a franchise fee, but net 150K, so not that different, so why is $CMG valued nearly 3 TIMES higher?"

"Went to McDonalds this weekend. Store forces customers to use kiosks to order. While I was in there 3 customers came in and left without ordering when told they had to order on the kiosks. If customers are not important enough to have humans take their orders, then I would imagine McDonalds will start having many less cutomers. I made up my mind never to go back."
MCD just released their comps..down to 22%! Which shouldn't be a surprise..

"3 Analysts say buying opportunity and price targets $225-$230. One says neutral and $195. The Franchisees did not like this CEO that got fired. They actually formed a union of sorts against him. So, its probably a long term positive."

Still no value here with a PE over 25. Priced like a smaller chain with good expansion opportunities and not a giant with a saturated market and limited growth. CFA has 2 new stores opening this Thursday to ghost town 2 more unfortunate MCD franchises and another 2 open next Thursday Nov 7th.

Our usual $MCD buffet on Friday will include French Fries as we will be watching the Ryder Cup early.

With app printing this is a good deal too. Mobile ordering works great.

It is defying logic and gravity.....IT WILL crash back to the 50 day average at some point....Very comfortable with my 1000 share short from yesterday.
I agree that MCD will go up. Added to my position today after selling some wmt stock. It is doing very well also in my home town. It probably will be opening up soon for dining inside.
"How can MCD be at $160 and CMG at $626?? They take better care of their Chief operators of the company than that of their employees that already give innocent people E-coli for eating that #$%$ in the first place. If CMG is at $626, Burger King and Wendy's should be priced at $2k."
Great potential for long holds.
"You people keep telling yourself stories;Bottom line is the buy backs are cutting it, the all new and improve menu's and prices aren't doing it.

Yesterday I wanted to grab some McD's on my way home from my brother's--about an hour and a half drive--but the first 3 McDonald's I came across had so many cars in their drive throughs that I had to simply leave. I ended up getting my order at the fourth McDonald's I found. Their sales have got to be going through the roof!
in 3 weeks mcd market cap is up considerably more than two times the annual incomesell this slot machine before the FBI drag them off
"The quarter income was up 14% yoy. Tax law changes and increase comps. However, 14% but the PE is 26.Dividend 2.59% is pretty good, not as high as the 10 year treasury, 2.94 or so.Treasury is likely to move up, maybe pulls back first, but the Chinese are buying less, some other countries are buying less, the US is selling more, has to move up. Where does MCD go? Could go up more, maybe considerably more, it does what it does, but based on 14% growth, it seems high enough. My guess is it does move up, and it moves sideways for a while, and then it may sell off a bit.I can't find the exact ex dividend date. I saw Feb 28, so the next may be May 28 or so. I would be surprised if it stays up that long, depends on the market. Earnings has been pretty good, really good even, but the market seems to want to sell the news.good luck"
"forward PE 22.65so without the buybacks, that's a PE of 45.3how long are they going to run up the debt to do buybacks?"

You cannot keep McDonald’s down. Easy 200
"Add/Buy MCD shares during dips has worked well for me for 20+ years, and I welcome these periodic buying opportunities to add to my MCD position. PS, I am now an old fart, and thinking back, I really enjoyed working at McDonalds as my first job. Waring that funny hat and searing the meat, making fries and apple/cherry pies, milk shakes,... Got paid $3.50 per hour and that was great money for me at the time, gained a sense of pride making money on my own. I told my Mom I no longer need her to give me lunch money any more. Now I am a MCD shareholder and enjoy buying a few toys with the dividend payouts. MCD is a great American business. When I was in Denmark a couple years ago, I spotted a McDonalds near the Tivoli amusement park. I went straight there and enjoyed a really nice American burger, fries, and a shake. It hit the spot!"

"RBC Capital cut MCD's price target from $190 to $170 today, citing the soft performance of the new $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu. IMO there is no way American poor can handle the price hike to $2 and even $3, especially all other fast food chain still have many $1 items on their menu. This is all on CEO Steve. He got too greedy. Now people stop going to McDonald's."

The new burgers are great; McDonald’s is beating both Wendy’s and Burger King; I used to never go to McDonald’s but now it is my only choice; look at the decor difference between McDonald and the other burger chains; this stock will go to 200 for certain; if you don’t believe me just visit one of these new stores

"I went to Wal-Mart today. The McDonald's has zero car in the drive-thru while Burger King has one car. People began to feel the cash crunch now. They won't spend $9 a meal for each person at McDonald's or Burger King. Or any fast food store. They will cook by themselves. Even so, I began to see the food inflation is 25% or higher. Not only there are no discount any more, all ingredients in supermarket are priced 20% to 30% higher compared to two months ago. Even merchandises at Wal-Mart and Target are at least 10% to 30% higher. I will buy Wal-Mart, Target and Kroger stocks on Monday. Their earnings reports will exceed the estimates by a lot while McDonald's and other fast food chain stocks will see their earnings down 50% to 90% next quarter."

"MCD is like KO of the 60s and 70s. i remember as a kid seeing giant coca cola signs at the entrance and in the middle of back woods asian towns and there were all the brilliant advertisement campaigns and promotions. they sold the heck out of brown sugar water. if they had to rely on just coca cola to survive, they would be close to bankrupt by now because drink choices and tastes have changed so much over the last 50 years. MCD is a great company. it is still a cash cow. there is still some room for growth in the mcdonalds brand, but tastes are changing. this is the first of the last three generation of kids up to teenage years who have never eaten at a mcdonalds. MCD's reputation problem is viral. there are too many other choices at that price point. trying to provide higher quality food into that environment at that price point is a problem for MCD. it is not the 15 cent burger place anymore.KO diversified into the largest bottled water vendor in the usa and other ""healthy"" drinks to keep growing at a coupla per cent/year. MCD needs to diversify. they should buy some of those restaurants they are franchising from their stash(asset stripping anyway) and launch a new brand. MCD has the juice to pull it off but do they have the huevos. in the meantime, analysts are crowing about this quarter not counting because last year was abnormal so MCD will be worth 15-40 in a year based upon a plan that purposely ignores the reputation problem(are they really going to try to change their entire image in a matter of a coupla years after years of ignoring the signals!!! are they really serious!!!). the reality for MCD isn't any kind of a real disaster, not yet, and probably not for a long time but not in the form it is in today. for now, a pe of 23 is silly. the ceo is asset stripping to make the books look good and is borrowing money to buy back shares at the same time. that's hardly a long term strategy for a company with declining revenue. 2 billion dollars could have launched a mccafe stand alone franchise but this guy decides to pad his paycheck., and you guys love him? the real price for MCD is around 100 if that. it is not growing. it cannot match the beginning of what was hoped to be a long. persistent, increasing demand for breakfast all day. they could not keep the customers gained in the first part of the promotion one year later. brick and mortar retail is down 15%. ebay and amzn are having lots of special promotions. do you think people are making special trips just to go to mcdonalds instead of shopping? they aren't even ordering pizza delivered."
And now the leg up to $230 begins
I have not been to McDonald's for a while. I am surprised to see they jacked up prices so much on yesterday's visit. I ordered the quarterpounder cheese bacon combo. It cost me $9.03. Then I found out the buns are about 2/3 of the size in the past so the combo meal only filled half of my stomach. I ordered the sundae and learned its price is no longer $1 but $1.89. It is insane to spend $11 on a meal with dessert. No wonder I am one of the two customers in a store that were packed one year ago.

"I told all of you a just about a year ago this thing was an overblown whale, their cash flow was right on the line just barely covering their debt and expenses.

I'm not paying for some hamburger trash company with my tax money."

Right now McDonald's Europe and Asian are making good money. But US stores are losing money and customers. This is all CEO Easterbrook's fault. He only runs the US and let Europe and Asia stores run independently. You can see the overseas menu are great and the stores are clean and just the opposite in most US stores.

"This is a good buy at 156. Sales might hurt while canoes are required to get to stores. But after the water is cleared out, people will want that McDonald's comfort more than ever. And being low priced is another big plus in these situations. Couple weeks, and the stock will be at 160 again, I'm guessing."

When I called up and complained to corporate they have a recording of it so do I they said I was slurring my words. I have overbite a medical condition which I can prove is a medical procedure but I had open mouth surgery and it will never correct slurs unless person is close to you. I will always have a slur. This is a fact on medical record. For them to accuse me of anything else without asking a medical record without proving they are biased with their opinion. This is why I will continue and will file a lawsuit against McDonald’s for ten million dollars unless notified to solve this issue, this is not a threat or a promise this is something I have to do to prove that McDonald’s was racist.

Told them I get really sick eating dill pickles and wanted them to make me a fresh sandwich. They didn't........... all they did was take the dill pickles off, also added no onions, which is how I knew they didn't make it fresh as where many onions on it. I had to throw it away after first bite. Wednesday I gave them another chance. Ordered food for me and my 81 year old mother and said WE CAN NOT EAT dill pickles, I heard person working saying take gloves off and then make them new. (there was one person there who has an issue with where i work, which I commented about) I tasted dill on my burger, so all they did was scrape it off. Talked to mom today and hers were even worse, said whole burger had a major dill taste. Told her not to eat any more of the 6 burgers I bought her. I don't care if you don't like me, but to do that to my mother, I have a BIG problem I called tonight and the manager, which I doubt he was, said, SO, what do you want me to do about it.."

Walmart is tanking. The lower income customers are tapped out and this is true for mcdonalds also. Be careful about buying MCD based on crooks upgrades as they do this in order to sell their overpriced shares to you the naive imo..

"Easterbrook is trying something new to boost the revenue. The old promotion is 2 for $4 for breakfast. Since most people will order a coffee with the sandwiches, McDonald's will get $5 per customer. The new promotion starting this week is $3 per breakfast sandwich. It is a gamble. McD will get $7 if the customer orders two sandwiches as usual. Or they will get only $4 if the customer now just orders one sandwich with their coffee. The worst scenario is that the customers head to other fast chain because others have better deals.At the start of every quarter, CEO Easterbrook always tries something in hope to make customers pay more. But he failed each time and went to back 2 for $4 breakfast and 2 for $5 for lunch/dinner. Hope this time he finally succeeds."

SWEET!McDonald's (MCD) PT Raised to $250 at SunTrust
This stock will be up big ...buy options and u will make lot of money $$$$ tomorrow .
I dont understand this ! today its one of the best investments ! techstocks are crashed - fastfood is a growing market and it hasgood earnings and a very good outlook in the coming summerseason !!!why is no buying-interest !?
What time do they report earnings? Just before market open (9:29)?
the dividend is coming!
McSky is falling
Have held since $30 bucks go McDonald’s
Is earnings announcement before market opening or after closing?
"Wendy's got killed this morning. Was at 17.2 to 17.4 or so, traded at 15.5 earlier this morning."
"Market Realist articlethey put growth prospects at 10%I suggested around 7%, not including buybacksPE 25maybe 14 is reasonable14/25 * 166 = $93............................I got a 4% return, income/market cap (at 165)a lot of stocks are a lot higher, look at CaterpillarI see $130 as a good price target, considering that interest rates are moving up, gas will move up with oil (moved up). Heating costs, etc.. Recession predicted. dividend -> $143 value, until interest rates go upWarren Buffet was asked the number one advice he could give people and that is ""don't listen to analysts"".You have to pay attention to what they say, when they say it, but int he end reality comes home to roost. Where were the analysts a little while back when MCD was trading at $148 (March 1 , 2018). Its up 11.5% since then."
$MCD dropped the 2 for $5 Filet o Fish. Damnit.
Ex-CEO. Black owners. Everybody is suing McDonald's headquarters. They must be bad people. Racists and sexists.
With a conflicting report on MCD being overvalued and then being told that MCD is a strong buy who really gives a darn as this has been one of the strongest return on investment that we have had in over 25 years. They just raised the dividend to $5.00 for those of us that have held this stock for many years that is a return of over 10%
I bought in at 177 I hope I don't regret it....grr
been a year in the market and learned alot should have sold at 215ish and bought back in but hey im young and im learning but McDonalds all the way

"so it looks like MCD has an ""effective PE"" of 47 or so26 x 1.8 (80%)numbers are sloppy, just talking the poingthe inverse of the PE is 1/47 = .021so without the buybacks they earn about 2 cents on a dollarbut what really stinks is the debt, check the overall liabilities going the moonwhy, to do buybacks and give away dividendsand to keep the CEO in position?"

this year the stock should go up higher becuase of the new kiosk in their restaurants.

"Enjoy the ride up to the dividend pay out. This is not an over valued stock. How could it be, it never had a run up. It also held up through the housing collapse."
This needs to pierce through the 50DMA. Wondering if it will trade up to the $185-186 resistance level up until earnings.

"WOW, dollar surging near 52 week high...what happens to profits? OH, they go DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I noticed that MCd revenue has been falling for the last 2 years , what is it ? I think more and more people are avoiding eating outside and especially fast food . In my opinion buy Walmart as it will benefit a lot from this trend. Avoid MCd for next few years until it can figure out how to grow revenue again ."
"Also, the put to call ratio on bonds is 2:1. They are afraid as they should be that bonds will crash. When bonds crash, interest rates move up and the market crashes.The national debt is too high, can't borrow so much at this point, time to go the other way. Higher interest rates for MCD are going to push the stock down, even more than other stocks.That's my take, we will see what happens.At this point, it looks like things are still moving up."
When does MCD usually raise the div?
Can't wait to get this nightmare week over with.

"Just takes one infected food prep employee to infect hundreds at a place as busy as McDonalds if that person isn't wearing a mask while talking away over people's food! This is 2020, not 2000 BC.

"I always like Wendy's burgers more than McDonald's. An recently I love going Wendy's more than McDonald's because CEO of Wendy's pay attention to what McD is doing. For example, Wendy's give away free frosty when McDonald's give free ice cream cone. Wendy's add new menu item ""Bacon Queso Fries"" when McDonald's adds bacon cheese fries. Wendy's is cheesier, bigger and tastier and costs only $2.50 compared to $3.99 McDonald's offering. McDonald's CEO is overrated and got to go. He is copying and chasing all other fast food chains and has no original idea."
MCD and pizza joints are gaining in restaurant market share. The double barrel MCD drive-throughs are working brilliantly. MCD is agile and makes adjustments as to suite the situation.

"PE = 27 as shown here on yahoo finance mcd5,924,300 5,192,300 4,686,500 4,529,300the most recent year of income is to the left above looks like 9.36% income growth per year, but the liabilities up around 8.2 billion dollars in the same period. Long term debt is approximately $7 billion. Total assets are down $5 billion in 3 years, that's most of the ""income at the top left (most recent year). That's a serious amount. Why so much, while paying out substantial dividends and doing substantial buybacksand then having to pay interest on the debt. Too much competition? If I take the long term debt from the income above, I get negative $1 billion. Liabilities another $1.3 billion negative. I wouldn't call it manipulation, but I'm not sure what to call it. Why not pay down the debt/obligations. That's money in the company's pocket in terms of the money saved in interest as well as staying on top of the debt rating and having cash to use for future opportunities."

"McDonalds, please ignore our ignorant AP, reuters, and yahoo finance. Please continue keeping people who are homeless, and have lice, bed bugs, roach droppings, and urine stained clothing from using the rest rooms, and sitting for hours in a booth. I prefer my food not being a couple of feet away from filth. if you have any trouble keeping these people out, complain to the Health Department, and suggest that the people who want you to let them live there take them in."
Will MCD management warn like SBUX?
"Based on the concept of RACIST , McDonald is # 1 on the list as they have now said they are RACIST against WHITE people and will discriminate against WHITE people when they promote. IF you are WHITE and work for McDonald's you need to quit and fine a NEW JOB today or don't be surprised what happens to you. By WHITE people . When they find out you work at McDonalds Just the way it works no need to even make stuff up FACT"
I hope nobody bought this at this price.

"Look at the financials, McD's Rev's have been declining for how long now? Do you really believe this run up makes sense?It doesn't!"
Wow- I have almost 100% gain on MCD in 5 years. Divs now part of my retirement income. Simple folks if you keep it simple:Quality/value x compound reinvesting increasing dividends x time = early retirement.
Sales will most likely disappoint again. There will be no safety hear either.
What the heck happened?
I am sure holiday season lot of Big Mac and smoothies sold. Earning should be good

"One of my sons works at local MCD 5 days a week. He's so fast and good that he grills every burger there. Today and yesterday, thee were no business at all."
Boycott McDonald’s and Coca Cola . Bad for you and woke.

Why did MCD drop today?
How are they going to segregate the grilling to satisfy the one vegetarian customer a day? More food for the dumpster like the salads.

"My last data showed growth at 7.3% (two years income growth/2)maybe not so accurate?long term debt grew by 7.3% from Dec 31 2015 to Dec 31 2016long term debt grew by 14.1% from Dec 31 2016 to Dec 31 2017So earnings went up by 7.3%, but so did debt the first year and twice that the second year.Instead of buying back stocks, they should be paying off the debt, getting ready for the recession that economists are predicting will come the first or second quarter of 2019 (or so, or whenever). The repurchase was $4.4B. Total long term debt is $29.5BTotal liabilities is $37.11 B up from $33.2 B one year before, a 11.7% rise."
"I just talked to a Manager at McDonalds and was told the minimum wage raise is hurting business quite a bit . The dollar menue ic cancelled and they are cutting hours , any new hire is less than 30 hours and a lot of kids do not show up for work they are getting rid of them. In ca there is a law in fast food that they have to work a minimum of 2 hours"
I wrap $MCD bacon around my johnson and women love it.
Is a split in the near future with the big jump today??? I hope so.
cvs has two times MCD's earnings
Does MCD report before or after bell tues?
McDonald's will be hit harder than most other fast food companies because their menu is not attractive. I would go through Chick-Fil-A drive-thru because I craved for their chicken nuggets. While thinking of McDonald's food makes me vomit. I don't know why some people want to eat there before Covid 19.
$1.71 versus $1.59 expected
Anonymous started his nonsense; he has been saying bad things about McDonald’s for the last year and the stock went up from 160 to 197
"They know who did it, Gibbs, Obamas former press secretary, and now they are lying and back peddaling. This will go down as a lesson to corporate America as the biggest social media disaster. Shareholders should demand the entire brass of McD' s resign or be fired. Someone said it best, our stores suck, our employees are mostly illegals and our sales keep falling, what can we do on social media to change things? ""Hey Boss, I've got an idea...""They thought they were going to find a ground swell of support from liberals by bashing the President of the United States, and not even intellectual, just rehashing Rubio's crude comments, of course he was caught with a gay prostitute in a park once, married guy and all."
Why isn’t this up on the good news?
Could drop to last night's low $201.13. Someone knows something.
They sold out of the Happy Meals in my city due to the POKEMON craze. With the new sandwich released I think this stock will do really well
"Not trying to be funny or rude... but people arent getting any smaller. in fact a recent study shows 53% of people in the US eat fast food every single day. For that reason, and because I never see an empty line at McDonald's... huge beat tomorrow morning."
OVERSOLD - Buying opportunity!

"MCD is like a pitching staff that can't hold a lead. Up early, it always manages to sell off as the day goes on."
McDonalds can now start their day with WE McDonalds pledge a legion to be more RACIST and more Discriminating to White PEOPLE and WE McDonalds will pay even BIGGER bonuses to the ones that are the most RACIST and Discriminating. McDonalds now serves the Devils chicken sandwich because being Racist and discriminating is something the devil would do.

Billions being made, gear up your employees!"
MCD was always on my wish list. Now I will buy it at $138.25 if it gets put to me at $145. I thin this is a good entry point for my buy and hold dividend portfolio.

"If it is true that 25 million people eat at McDonalds everyday and 70% of the population in America is white and McDonalds has come out and said they are RACIST to White people and going to discriminate against White people . What % of the White population will not eat at McDonalds ever again LOL,LOL,LOL Just wait once the first White person is killed at McDonalds because it will happen Because we do not live in a Fantasy land we live in the real world How many White people do you think will still eat at McDonalds, McDonalds just put a target on any White person working or eating at McDonalds FACT. That is the real world we live in . On the news everyday. FACT"
What has happened to this thread? Bots galore
"Mcdonalds is wise enough to be early sometimes. The Arch Deluxe was your best burger ever, should bring back at least the simple version I bought everyday on work lunck break, circular piece of bacon, iceberg lettuce piece, (not shredded ot leaf, big fresh slice of tomato, arch deluxe sauce, cheese, or no cheese, was an undeniable hit. Also Pepsi AM and Jolt Cola were just early, would sell like Ice today. Why do you think Coke is makiing the coke energy drink selling in Europe available here soon? A coke am just coke exactly with 4 or 7 times caffeine would have done better even. We live in a new world of vapors, 25% global increase in purer cocaine supply than ever, more opiate addicts than ever and meth addicts thanks to cartel supplies and distribution. If Coke and hopfully soon Pepsi puts out a pepsi energy just pepsi with more caffeine, students and young adults might do less overall drugs, which would be a good thing. Pepsi brought that and clear pepsi crystal back in 2020, both would sell like crazy as they finally pass coke for good. The new coke energy coming first in 2020 from stops the reality of pepsi passing them in market cap. They can't now because now coke is out 1st with a common sense energy drink of their own. Now mcdonalds is a tech company, where they screw up is needing more fountain flavors with more syrup, (not the way wendy's does it, that is a failure way and tastes of garbage poisons like.) Buy jones flavor strawberry lime, sobe, pear flavor, and jones watermelon, root beer flavor, berry lemonade flavor. Lastly if Mcdonalds signs 2 or 3 year deal with beyond meat, that helps mcdonalds with the 1 person of group in car that doesn't want to go to mcdonalds because their salads suck, no other veg options. Chick filet lemonade is smart but need a strawberry limade right next to it, mcdonalds should also do that before them."
McD is one of the best Corporations in the world. U will never lose a night's sleep owning McDonald's.

I hate when they run it up into earnings. Would rather be down. Then we have a much bigger move up. If MCD disappoints watch out.

"I over 40 years of stock market experience I have never seen such clueless comments which are obviously from real novices that ignore the danger from a stock that any time could return to its $111 stock price it was before Trump's election just as many other stocks have done and then some e.g. IBM , FDX UPS xom at 5 year lows"
How could MCD back to and surpass pre\crises price when I see it only has less than 10 percent business in my area?
I said 220 by advanced modigliani analysis. I will need to redo my analysis

You probably want to sell all your MCD shares now. South Korea seized McDonald's SK headquarters documents may expose the chemicals McDonald's add to their chicken and beef.
"My employees love our weekly $MCD run for the office. Now that the pumpkin spice #$%$ is off the menu, they like the apple pies and cherry too. Tomorrow we are getting 50 McChickens and 50 McDoubles with cheese. Fries of course. Saving the Filet of Fish for lent. Long and strong."

McD best Corporation in World.
"Look at RES symbol, it's a hidden gem."
Mcdonalds can’t possibly be honest with donations they receive . They can’t deal honestly with a paying customer
If you don’t believe me visit any McDonald’s presently. Tell me which other restaurant company has 5 percent comps. Starbucks has only one percent comps. Huge economies of scale and clearly improving food at cheap prices. The middle class needs a place to eat reasonable food fast and convenient. If the salad thing didn’t bother the stock this stock is going to 190 this year
Why are we down today

"$15 an hour? Since when is McDonalds a ""career"" making burgers & frys? Entice high school kids to drop out for this? And the ""flunkys"" who haven't moved on, have been there for several years, are now rallying their $15 movement around sexual harassment claims (trend is spreading everywhere). Extortion vs. extortion, both sides are at it. At $15 an hour, the government better double up unemployment checks, welfare checks, social security & all pensions for McDonalds ""base"" customers to afford eating there (nearing $10 meals where McD's used to advertise ""change back from your dollar"").

"remember around 188 I said MCD was a pig for buying back so many shares and giving away money (dividends) when they have so much debt and liabilities and their PE is bogus, as it looks so much better due tot he buybacksand some dirty longs could only knock my comments but had nothing to say discussion wiseha ha to youtry thinking in the future"

"This is why you don't want to buy MCD stock. CEO said, ""Customer visits in the U.S. declined, but rose notably in Japan, France, Australia and Canada leading to an overall traffic rise of 0.8 percent."" As CEO said and I noticed in the recent visit, McDonald's raised prices on almost all items. That is why even customer count decline in US and rise 0.8% in Europe and Japan, they are able to beat the estimate this quarter. But next quarter, they cannot raise the prices again."
MCD was downgraded by Jaf and price was cut significantly.

MCD is going to make new 52 week low either this week or next week. The P/E is too high and the business is bad if not down to toilet already. Probably will hit double digit in early 2019 as the bear market is on the corner.

"Youngsters, This is a div play that sometimes gives back some growth too. I've bought and sold several times over 10 years + time. Makes $ all the time. You have to buy a lot of it and hold it then you will like when you see the dividend deposited into your account. This isn't going to skyrocket like zoom or something￼-But it's also not potentially going to crater overnight.￼"
About time it corrected. There's going to be a good buying opportunity soon in this stock.
I'm not going to ride this through earnings. I'm up 11% from the Steve doing his secretary pullback. Hopefully 15% before the earnings call and thank you very much.

"I've never looked at this stock before. I don't ever eat McDonald's either. Last night I was out with someone who wanted to it. The drive through was ~15 cars deep. Is this a good buy during the pandemic? Anecdotal evidence says, maybe?"
"Sell-off is overdone. McDonald's is now projected to see its Q1 earnings surge by 14.29%, based on the latest Zacks Consensus Estimate. McDonald’s is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 9% over the next three to five years. Looks like a buy to me"

Yay soon I can buy this at a good price
I'm betting McDonald's will be up considerably by end of day today... Best quarter in a decade. granted it's not a tech company so it's going to move a little slower. But for a long-term hold with consistent earnings and a dividend close to 3% this is definitely a keeper in my IRA. Buy on any pullbacks.
"Where gut health and immune strength is based largely on whole grains and vegetable in the diet, why has MCD eliminated all salads from their menu during a pandemic when immune function could use a boost? They once had a delicious Asian salad plus other main dish varieties, plus side salads and were proud of these offerings."
McDonald's reached a 52 Week low at 173.84
I'm thinking McDonald's is one of the best companies in the world. I have never lost a night's sleep invested in McDonald's. Nothing to stop it. Amazon can't stop it. Governements are not targeting it with regulation. Iconic brand with a presence all over the world.

I went to our local mcdonalds this morning only to get a shock when I was told that the price of beverages more than doubled from 1 to 2.19 before tax. When I asked why I was told that they are getting a raise to 12.75 p/hr starting in January. She said other items will be going up. If I am going to spend the same as I would at Wendy's that is where I will be going for better quality food.

"These double drive thrust are so cool, you can play demo derby and get your McChicken faster too !"
McDonald’s are scammers . You order a large fry and you get a medium fry . How greedy . You already paying enough to buy ten pounds worth of potatoes and they can’t even give you a large fry when you order it . That’s pure evil and greedy . This is why I don’t give to McDonald’s charity or buy very often from McDonald’s. Now they want to sell you a basket of fries for nearly 4 dollars and they probably will give you a little bit more than medium fries . Bunch of greedy crooks . I’m since this is how they are going to operate I would like some laws passed against McDonald’s about being transparent about how many fries you get if you order a large fry ? Seriously . This is why you have Americans clinging to socialism . Greedy capitalist got to always be so greedy and not serve you what you pay for . I hope Bernie wi s the nomination .

"Had a crispy chicken sandwich yesterday, MCD has a winner, it was better than the last Chick-Filet sandwich I had. The cinnamon roll is also terrific. Now if they could go back to the coffee they had a few months ago I will return being a regular customer and maybe buy the stock again"
Only in a market out of touch with reality could a restaurant company with declining earnings and flat growth sport a 25 pe. It's a clown world.

Why hasn't McDonald's Corp. stopped using plastic straws and foam cups? Our waterways and the Oceans need far less plastic trash entering them.
These new digital menu's are complete garbage. Half the menu is displayed now and it keeps chainging every 10 seconds so I cant even look at there new items. I eat fast food a lot sadly because of my job and I kjow the menu pretty good but not with these junky digital ones. Its a menu not a movie.
"But, they only missed by 3 cents? Shouldn't it be up more?"
Beat it down enough to let run now?
when the stock can split?
"McDonalds has been using fresh beef for a while now. I do believe it has a more appealing sensation when you bite into a 1/4 pounder. They seem to be well done, and not mushy like before. I used to get single cheeseburgers before they changed the beef. Anyway, while the texture is improved, I'm not sure about the taste. it seems rather bland. They put salt on fries. Are they putting any salt and pepper, or are they putting anything in the beef before cooking, to give it some taste ? all I taste is the cheese, ketchup, onions and pickles. The meat is bland. It needs something."
Should US bank the junk food chains? People are getting fat
198 tomorrow for sure
Thanks for the cheap shares! MAGA!

"Without a 100 % a stock go to 0000000000000000 , with hate , lower sales , VETs march-----BAD press----VTES march----MCD could go to 70--$80--- VOTE OUT the BOARD -----------DUMp NFL"
Was going to buy shares but bad experience in the Spain store in Santa Justa Sevilla - so decided not to - Good luck guys
shareholders in MCD have lost billions in last few months with market manipulations of share prices.
McDonald's has a great brand. Great history. Great locations and franchise arrangement. But.. does anyone have details about their management?

"McDonald’s and the tobacco company Altria, which are among the top 20 donors to McCarthy, the House (R)epublican leader, have not announced a halt on donations to any Congress members. The fascists don't appreciate the bad publicity."

I had some MCD fries yesterday. Yum!

"$taco has great ratios, excellent Price book value. However, $400,000,000 in debt is a huge liability.I do not see them doing huge business like in and out or Chick filet. 583 restaurants is a joke, they need to have at least 5,000 and up. They should do what $MCD does be in business of real estate rather than in Tacos. MCD sells worth food than Taco and does well so is in and out. IN and out has the worst food and people are eating it lol"
"September restaurant sales fell, marking the fourth straight month of declines. $MCD $YUM $WEN $CMG"
No real bump after upgrade to buy from Longbow. I definitely wouldn't mind their $227 target...

Still eating more at CFA ... but loving MCD stock today !!

Alright it up from here. Bottom is over
May turn green. Go MCD.
Breaking down today? Good chance to get in before October earnings. Should run to 160 before earnings announcement. North Korea tension has made this stock rise in the past.
"UH OH....CARTER WORTH ON ""FAST MONEY"" JUST SAID THAT MCD IS FAR OVER-EXTENDED AND THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE PROFITS OR SHORT LIKE i HAVE!!! It is up every day since APRIL 10th except 3 ( and those were flat)....that is UP TWENTY ONE straight business/trading days!!!!!!! Guarantee after ex-dividend day it craters."
MCD has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. I started receiving notifications from awe-someSTOCKS the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
Company on track to break $232.00 wall.

Like I said - be patient - the entry price is only getting nicer! :)
"This can’t be good news for mcd can it ?Retail sales in the U.S. rose 0.1% month-over-month to $509 billion in September, versus the average expectation of a 0.6% increase, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The rate of increase in retail sales stayed flat from the revised August 0.1% advance, according to a release from the Commerce Department Monday. Purchases at food-services and drinking establishments fell 1.8% in September, the largest decline in nearly two years, which weighed on retail sales at large."
Markets will crash by end of day SELL SELL SELL. MCD down $10 by end of day

Lots of McHaters out there today.
"Chicken McNuggets work pretty well if you want to practice and can't get to a driving range,"
Not a great investment at these levels....not until sub 170.
I get engorged every time I see both drive thru lanes full and cars not able to enter the parking lot at $MCD. I love the McChicken and this drive thru worker best. She always gives me extra ketchup which I rebottle at home.
CONGRATS if you loaded up on the June 19th CALLS when they were dirt cheap under $200 
"I think McDonald's ending 2 for $5 Mix and Match promotion is a huge mistake. Everybody else is still doing it. It will lose customers. Not too many people are willing to pay full price in this economy, especially for the quality of food McDonald's offers."
Longbow upgrades MCD to Buy!
Noticed a modification to the quarter pounder seasoning a slight soy addition perhaps ground softening transition to more plant burgers
Still looking at 220 by next week!

I thought McDonald’s will go to 190 but now I believe it will go to 200 easily; Anonymous keeps posting nonsense trying to badmouth the best restaurant company
Easily 200 dollars a share
"MCD is one great American company, and a fantastic long term investment. God bless America!"

Going over $204.00 today !!!!
$3.50 for two breakfast burritos and a large coffee. $MCD will hit $220 on that alone.
Keep it down to run up at earnings. At least I hope so lol
"He goes MCD, into the crapper"
"IF MCD wants to see buyers pour into the stock and send the price soaring to $250-$300 quickly, then announce a stock split imo. "

Just added to my position.
McDonald's fries are the best !
Stick a pin in this thing. It's done.
"Southern people dont buy --- MCD hates the south , we voted for President Trump--- MCD supports NBA - BLM -NFL---the flag haters , MCD likes police hater , baby killers , BLM-----"
Black Rock and Vanguard will take a huge hit --PEP---MCD - their largest holdings -------Both are SLOW --they should have SOLD when the first DUMP on the flag--- Load the truck LIBS ---buy the company---
WE NEED BUYERS...IF WE GO BELOW 165 I SEE IT GOING TO 140'S REAL QUICK...LOOK AT THE CHARTS....
"was way overvalued, now correcting. hopefully 160-170 soon"
Watch for a split in the next few months or sooner.

"They have mobile ordering like SBUX now. I go there a few times a week just to get fries. Last few months they have been getting busier and busier. Sorry I didn't buy the stock, now."
Will buy at $140
No other value stocks are cheaper than MCD. Loaded at 157.50. Good luck to all.
"I'd love to see Mickey Dees compete more with Burger King. Burker King has some great deals, like a 5 dollar Whopper, fry and drink special, and an unbelievable 2 for 6 buck deal. I eat there 95% of the time when buying fast food compared to Mickey Dees!!"
Giveth and taketh away..
"Anyone else eat a ""McChicken"" and was awoken feeling like they had one eye and three legs?"
Most of the gains in MCD happened between 1984 and 2000. Went up 20 times. But from 2000 to now less. Divvy is important but growth is more.
The man we orchestrated MCD's rebound is gone. All the ideas left with him.
"As the economy tanks due to the antics of the ""Orange Genius"" in DC, more people will be going to McDonalds to eat. Ride the wave! (God, I miss Obama.)"
"Made this comment late April,since then the madness has continued....stay close to exit!Something does not add up - apart from the question about the quality/offering by what is in effect a fast food takeaway, Valuation PER OUTLET (pls don't call it Restaurant) is $9.6 Mio, this is insanity, Revs per outlet 2.15 Mio, that is in line with many restaurants, Net just 130k, also roughly in line, restaurants ARE NO GOLD MINE in the best of times, compare this to $MCD, McDonalds, that is bit problematic comparision as it is a franchise model, but still, val per outlet 3.6 Mio, highish but after all there is a strong franchise with long track record, sales per outlet basically a franchise fee, but net 150K, so not that different, so why is $CMG valued nearly 3 TIMES higher?"
"Singapore just banned drive thru of all fast food chain. They singled out McDonald's because McDonald's employees first infected among themselves then infected customers using drive thru. All new cases are traced back to multiple McD employees in many stores who live in the same dorm because these employees are from other countries under working visa. Singapore citizens don't want to work this minimum wage job so they imported employees. Now they have hundreds of people infected with Covid 19 at once after almost zero cases for months. Also this proves drive thru is dangerous in spreading the virus. Now all McDonald's in Singapore are closed. Before today, they had drive thru and food delivery by 3rd party open for business.I think when US implements massive testing, they will find many Americans got Covid 19 from these drive-thru just like in Singapore. US should immediately close all fast food chains like Singapore."
MCD is up 5.18% to 178.94
Earning is coming January 30th what to expect ?
McDonald’s has proven its self. This Is one of the biggest real estate companies in the world. But most only see food.
Jus how long can we can expect this 8 1/2 yr bull market to keep charging?
Could fall to $99 very soon. Now people know breakfast is not selling as well once it loses the novelty.
"prices have went up, low quality products, shake machine is never up. No lines anymore, few customers hardly. Not the Golden Arches I know and love."
"SO MANY COMPANIES NOT WILLING TO, OR CAN’T AFFORD to pay their investors a dividend. MCD CONTINUES to look out for their investors. Stay long "

"I've enjoyed zero losses since August using a simple system. I monitor Dow 30 tickers and wait for selloffs such as MCD. When one occurs, I research the underlying cause with Barron's, WSJ, Motley, Bloomberg and conversations from Yahoo. If the selloff is not secular, I sell bull put verticals with the long ATM to provide max extrinsic, 90 day OPEX min. My risk must be less than 50%, typically, 30%. As soon as the ticker rise provides a 25% return, I leg out. However, if the trend is positive, I watch short term for my exit. Typically, exits occur around FIB retracements. I built one study which is a composite of Boll Bands, Keltner Channels, using Heiken Ashi candles, ATM averages, and volume averages. This all in one study took 3 years to compose. Trump has made trading very easy. It's a certainty he will screw up so just be patient and this terribly incompetent man will create entries and exits."
Is it True MCD plans to discriminate against whites by only promoting Blacks and women WOW or did I hear the story wrong
Burger King talking about methane. Man are they stupid. Long and strong $MCD
Okay enough. In at 192.40!!!

To McDonalds Longs : you are in a really good place . McDonalds Corp appears to be sliding into a strategy phase where :1)More & More McOpCo restaurants getsold to O/O -McD books nice gains .2) McD Corp outsources services to O/O's that it previously provided in-house . Bottom line ?Fewer Corp employees needed . Regionalpresence diminishes except for a small real estate contingent .3) Rent & Service Fees increase ( less corpstores )-corp expenses plunge .4) O/O organizations begin assuming mostif not all training functions & logistics (and costs !).5) McD in a strong position to push itstotal vision on O/O . All very very positive short and intermediateterm for Corp & stock but ... be warned ...that favorable pendulum will eventually turn -

Got in at 189 and 199. Nice stock so far.
Best French fries at McDonald’s . We all knew that for years
"The fact they got rid of Chief People officer is good news people ,shows management acts fast to get all the negative out in 1 day to make way for clear sailing green ahead. This is smart business. 1 bad day instead of many. Great opportunity to buy dont look a gift horse in the mouth so they say."
225 soon. yummy!
"let the market serve you, not instruct youWarren Buffet likes that rule. He learned it from ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Ben Graham.When they say ""buy the dips"" they are instructing you."
This keeps going down 
"Just heard from the radio that McDonald's again launched their 2 for $4 breakfast sandwiches again. In the beginning of every quarter, Easterbrook takes this promotion away and hoped customers will pay the full prices then the sales plunged. One month later, he put the promotion back again to compete with other fast food chains. We are in the middle of the first quarter, I can say for sure this quarter's earnings will be bad because they have wasted the last 30 days. Drove by McD every day twice, if there are no promotions, there are very few customers based on the cars parked outside."
"NO KIDDING ,, that was due to bad earnings, now a Rat got caught in the hen house for another 5 dollars- REALLY!! was it worth that much- heck no- due for a big bounce , better switch to long."
Will MCD split ?
Nice after hours rebound.
"I'm late, I didn't kno MCD has the M turned upside down for W-Women! not sure if it's for a day, week or what..."
The market is up over $120.00 and MCD is down over $1.00 what am I missing???
"bit expensive, perhaps debt level could be lowered with that much free cash"
sell sell sell panic panic panic
"Lord Jesus , the greedy wicked love the darkness, why should they see any light? Show them the darkness in the form of sickness and fear , that’s what they can see . In your name Jesus I pray you show the wicked what they see."
Congratulations to McDonalds for paying dividends on a regular basis year after year and giving a nice increase (15%) to the shareholders. Thanks - Good Job!
Bullet Proof
$MCD Target Raised by Telsey Advisory Group Outperform USD 250 » USD 260
This is one of the worst stocks to own. I sold mine at a loss because I can put the money to better use rather than waiting maybe a year just to get my money back and making no money at all.
white castle in direct competition with the big 3 hamburger company
Anyone seeing the new picture of Deluxe Chicken Sandwich coming out in February. It looks thick and juicy. Can't wait to try all three chicken sandwich at McDonald's. They all look bigger and thicker than any other fast food chains currently offer.
"Today when MCD passes $214, I've got to get a choc/vanilla twisty ice-cream.."
Will fill the gap to $158.3 faster than expected !
This stock stinks. It went up $9 on the day of earnings and proceeded to give it all up the following days.

"Sales down 20% hey let's buy even more with this high PE ratio and debt, don't worry we'll sell more hamburgers!"
"McDonald’s had their best quarter in last decade. Down 1 percent in pre market. Boeing had the worst quarter in the last decade. Up 3 percent in pre market. I do understand stocks are about the future. But at some point reality has to set in. The reality of what these companies truly earn and not what they could, might, maybe earn."
"loss of sales,months before the customer's come back"
Advanced modigliani technical analysis is indicating the stock to reach 200 in the next month. This kind of analysis is very complicated to perform but it has a success rate close to 100 percent.
MCD is not oversold yet. Stock loses Steam everyday as the market comes closer to the closing bell. that means big players are still getting rid of the stock in a hurry
BOOOOM goes the dynamite!!!!!!!!
Burger King is the King! McDonald's is Jive! Burger King #1!
Why is Yahoo Finance showing MCD closing at + $3.34 at $164.13. Fidelity shows MCD closing + $4.51 at $165.30. Can someone please explain this to me. Thank

"Worse restaurant in USAThe Sullivan, Indiana Mc Donalds is the worse restaurant in the United state bar none. Evidently the corperation has no one who checks on there francises.These problems been going on for weeks . Here is a sampleWent inside Sullivan, Indiana McDonalds 2 weeks ago Thursday and they were grossly understaffed. One guy cooking and about 4 people shouting orders at him the whole time he was there. He finally had enough and said the F bomb as loud as he could and said I quit and walked out. Took me 1/2 to get my food.Friday I go to same McDonalds at 9:30 p.m. and inside locked up and had a car parked across one of the drive thru's so was down to one lane. After waiting about 15 minutes the guy took my order and I asked him what was going on and he told me they were down to 4 people working. I asked him what they paid and he told me minimum wage. I asked him if he was aware the Mc Donalds just 20 miles up the road was paying $9 a hour starting out and he said they were talking about raising the salarys to $8 a hour. No wonder they cant't get no help. Tonight I go out to Mc Donalds in Sullivan , Indiana and the doors were locked up and lights all out . My question this has went on for at least 3 weeks. Does McDonalds not have a district person to go and check on franchises? Evidently not because I have called and left my name on how are we doing McDonald voice and no one ever calls you. Someone in cooperation needs to go out to that restaurant and see for themselves what going on out there. The franchises should be pulled if you cant run a restaurant better then that. So hope some one who is higher up in Mc Donalds lets district manager if they have one know he is not doing his job"
totally sucks

"Regarding the cheese lawsuit, a quarter pounder with cheese tastes entirely different than without cheese. I prefer without cheese and have also seen this ""sales technique"" at Wendy's, whom I believe was first doing this. It used to be the cheese sales push ""would you like cheese?"" when ordering, now it has to be said ""no cheese"" by the customer, who still pays for the cheese! Does it say ""world famous CHEESEburgers"" on their signs? NO! They read ""hamburgers""! That time ago when both Wendy's & McDonalds were pushing cheese on my order, I would say ""No, then that would be a cheeseburger which I do not want"". I was sick & tired of being offered cheese, now It's up to me to say ""no cheese"" or scrape the consequences off the best I can. What a way to have a strong company ""bottom line"" with customers saving them money inherently by subtracting items & cost of such. Once again, their signs read ""hamburgers,"" not ""cheeseburgers""! I'm definitely against this ripoff! Add Steak & Shake to the list, as they also have cheese automatically on their ""steakburgers"" (same signage, ""famous steakburgers"", not cheeseburgers). Seems to be an industry standard now. Why people want cheese to literally sour their hamburger is beyond me. To each their own bowel contentment or disruption."

All government food pyramid recommendations include several servings of meat."

Basically about TWO DOLLARS CHEAPER than a combo at McDs with a similar calorie count..."
McDonald's is the first one that sold their bonds (new issued for this occasion) to The Fed on 3/17/2020 with many DOW 30 stocks. The Fed did so to stabilize the stock market by giving away cash. But today The Fed announced to buy every corp bond. McDonald's is no longer special. Because now every US company got the same treatment!
ROME will rule the world
"Revenues cointine to drop!! this purveyor of pionk slime will suffer as people turn to grass fed beef and quality healthy food (not processed cheese, etc). OF course mosrt of the people that eat at MCD like the garbage. Most candidates for the 600 pound life fat loss program!!"
One quarter pounder with cheese and a side of vaccine please ...
sell this trash... nobody likes them these days
From my understanding McDonalds stock lost value when the vaccine news came out and it was presumed that everything was going to open up and McDonald's drive thru business would suffer. With the second wave coming and lockdowns looming McDonald's should go back to being a pandemic winner.
I really need a big mack in these harsh times. up n at em
"I guess the pooh salads, the cleaning fluid drinks and the heroin Dr. Peppers ain't selling, eh?"
"I've done well trading MCD this year but don't have a position at the moment. I've seen some negative commentary in recent weeks about the valuation and that's keeping me from going back in before earnings. However, I might nibble if I can buy around $156 before the call. I agree that the renovated stores are great, and have spoiled me for other fast food. Ordering from the kiosk and having the food brought to your table, rather than standing in line, is a game changer."
"I don't want my McDonald's eggs & coffee to go green. The reason people go there is for inexpensive food. If they want cage free & sustainable they go to Starbucks and pay $7 for a cup of coffee. We want lower costs not higher.....Know your customers & investors MCD mgmt! get a grip, this is absurd"
Should see selling pressure before $200.00 be careful.
It seems MCD is heading to $180 today
Not sure why people eat there. The time i have in the past - I feel rotten after eating one of thermals. Imagine people who go there regularly.
"the new chicken sandwiches, veggie meat burgers and full reopenings will boost MCD in 2021 and beyond."
Don’t be afraid of McDonald’s this is 200 stock
It’s selling on any strength

never again eating there after tweets!!
MCD might rebound tomorrow if GOOGL has a bad earnings report. Then people will sell risky assets and money flow back to safe haven stocks again.
"The two big price drops are coordinated with huge volume. Once these people sold, they won't come back. This forms a top for MCD. In the following months, we are getting lower and lower since higher price is now impossible. Smart people take profits here. You may come back in 2019."
"Love the $5 for 2 Filet o Fish. All I eat at that price, it is, with some added Tabasco, an epicurean treat. $MCD long and strong."
why is this down today?
"No reason for down day, more market BS"
Can someone tell me why MCD has so much debt?
"For decades, real estate has been a bedrock of McDonald's revenue strategy, with the company effectively serving as a quasi-REIT. “We are not basically in the food business. We are in the real estate business,” Harry Sonneborn, the first president and CEO of McDonald's, once told a group of Wall Street investors.If mortgage REIT and commercial REIT are next to implode because Covid 19 crisis intensified, MCD will be in bigger trouble than other fast food chain companies."
Is this a Good Entry Point?
The minimum wage is forcing McDonald's to get rid of the human being. McDonald's will be eliminating the humam being from it's restaurants. U will soon be buying ur hamburger from a very pretty Robot. The good news is there is no molesting charge if U pinch a pretty robot's behind.
I heard she called him big mac lol
MCD reached an all time high at 218.43
All the bashing think earning $7.54 a share had anything to do with the stocks move.?
"McDonald great company, but look at Luckin coffee of China, great turnaround story , has 6000 coffee shops like Starbucks, new management, new auditors , profitable at store level, benzinga and Motely fool like it too. Can be a big winner. Do your own due diligence for Hugh profit."
Going to buy MCD fries now. 
Won’t go much lower. They have very tenured management. Little hiccup for the long term investors.

Love this price action. I had just added a lot more to my position at $160.02 to put away for a long time Historically buying McDonald's on a dip you never go wrong. This company is a finely tuned machine.
"earnings x 4/ market cap = 5%hundreds of companies have 10% returnno big deal and a recession is on the wayand look at the debt and obligationsand moving averages 164 50 damthey are dumping, I bet170 support"
I have just perfomed my own Mogoldigupp technical analysis and this indicates McDonalds will go up or down from here.
Back to $187 then accumulate
Notice the closing price today and the amount it went up. Odd I thought.
Years ago I did not buy McDonald's at around $30 because I thought it was too much. If only I could go back and have a do over.
I’d buy a share at $100
Charts looks like the strings coming off a cheap suit
"Looks like MCD wants to go to $198.50, the low setting a few days ago in AH. I think some people know MCD's earnings miss back then."
The average fake cheese burger would cost $25.00 JUST TO BREAK EVEN but because of Government funding its 1.99. Have to keep the population down keep eating carcinogens...

"Burger King's 2 for $6 is killing McDonald's. Near my shopping spot, these two are near side by side. I count there are only four cars in McDonald's but almost 20 cards in Burger King. I went to Burger King and found out almost everyone was ordering their 2 for $6. People are saying without this promotion, they would pay $10 for a whopper and a crispy chicken sandwich. These are their premium food, not cheap food on McD's $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu. People want value and QUALITY. That is what McDonald's failure on $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu."
CNBC fool put a damper on the stock.

Really not lovin' it. Down over a buck on a green day.
Effective campaign to introduce the new international menu choices.
the new $15 is like $10 now.also they finished automation and now they don't need many works....let raise the rate. just like Amazon.
take their last 4 qtrs earnings ($7.85) give it a 15 PE 7.85x15= $117.75 fair value today. if sale keep getting worse (i think they will) give it a 12PE 7.85x12 = 94.20 or exactly 100 dollars to the penny below the current price as i type this. vastly over priced here. this will be falling for the next year who in their right mind would buy at these prices? LOL

I love the dividends that MCD pays and I think most of us shareholder would also like to see a split in the near future so more people could afford to get on the band wagon.
MCD is always easy money from dip buying. PATIENCE CONTINUES TO PAY. 
"There is something weird on this board. A lot of posters all claim the MCD drive thru is packed when in fact I can't find one with a car in it. I don't venture out for lunch, but the wait at breakfast is zero. I can't believe lunch is any better."
Nice setup for shorts
Why the big drop after hours?

"I actually had the new quarter pounder with cheese yesterday. Actually 2. BOGO. It was the first time in over 10 years I had a burger there. First of all, it doesn't look anything like what you see on TV. I expected that. The only thing I could taste, was the bun and the pickles. It is still the very bland burger they have always had. Maybe it's now a fresh very bland burger. Maybe they should add something to the burger to give it taste? I still believe that Burger King and Wendy's still have the best burgers because you can actually taste the meat. No matter...McDonald's is on a roll as far as stock price and will always be a household name. The CEO needs to taste his quarter pounder with cheese. Still the best french fries in the world."
Anybody else concerned about MCD's DEBT?
MCD closing 200 restaurants. 100 of them are in Walmart. Also they are adding a net of 350 new stores

"Mcdonald’s Fans Cheer As The Restaurant Opens 15 Chains In UKhttps://www.sectorreports.com.au/landing-page/?symbol=MCDMcdonald’s Corp (NYSE:MCD) is trading above its Parabolic SAR of $168.116, thus the stock looks bullish. Earlier this month, when one of the most popular fast food chains of the world, Mcdonald’s announced that from May 13, restaurants will open, fans had no bounds to their joy. The restaurant chain opened 15 of its UK restaurants, but only for delivery and no dine-in.The restaurants re-opening comes with stringent measures of social distancing, which includes perspex screens, floor markings or employees in close quarters as well as temperature tests for the staff on arrival.The restaurant has re-opened with limited menu and isn’t serving its popular breakfast items. This is done to reduce the level of complexities arising in kitchen due to changing menus from one time of the day to another."

Headed back to double digits. Valuation is too high.
can MCD stay green today?
The dude who says he can't afford a $200 stock should not be here. This is not meant for people that work OR eat at McDonalds!!

i don't think stimulus and the FED can save this market...I mean none of us wants to sell...so exactly who is selling?

"Did some corner of the envelope math: $SHAK restaurants are valued at around $12 million a unit (SHAK's market cap, divided by number of current units). For reference, $MCD per unit val is about $4 million. At the moment, $HABT has a per-unit market valuation of just $1.2 million per unit...one-tenth the valuation of #SHAK, and a quarter of McDonald's. Seems to me the upside is with $HABT and not $SHAK, strictly on how the market is valuing the respective companies on a per-unit/market cap basis."
Why is it going down so much? It it becouse i bought it? Lol
"I have been to our local MCD and they have two lines that take orders, this seems to get their customers like me in and through rather quickly, do love the growth of this company along with the nice dividends that have grown over the many years that I have held MCD."

"Corporations, released from democratic constraints, drive us towards climate breakdown, an urgent threat to global peace. McDonald’s has done more than its fair share: beef production is among the most powerful causes of climate change."

It’s too volatile, and too dependent on the Random swings of commodity prices to occupy a prime position in anyone’s portfolio - perhaps that’s why the PE stays so low."
CEO probably dumped stock last week before resigning hence the drop. Expect more drop next week as shorts pile on this dog

Had to drive from Minneapolis to Appleton this afternoon. Stopped at $MCD in Abbotsford for lunch and ordered 8 Filet o Fish for the ride. 4 fries. 2 Diet Cokes. 1 Strawberry Shake. Not hungry anymore. App works great for big orders.
"Not the bloodbath some were expecting today. With the MCD already 30 points off its 52-week high, there was only so much room for it to drop."
What are the chances of MCD splitting?
Mcd should see $235.00
"J Balvin Meal will be a failure. It is Big Mac, median fries with ketchup and Oreo McFlurry. Travis Scott meal is popular is because they sold $9 Bacon Quarterpounder meal for $6. On the other hand, Big Mac is the most discounted item on the menu, you will ALWAYS get it at 50% discount either using coupon or APP. Put it on the meal even at some discount won't attract many buyers. Also Oreo McFlurry is disgusting even for most fast food fat eaters.What consumers want is discount. And J Balvin meal doesn't deliver."
"I love being correct my mother asked me awhile ago, do you think mcd will do another split? hasn't happened in a long time (they have owned a significant amount of shares since the mid sixties)I told her no they will however give larger dividend increases. Booya just their dividends every year are 3 or 4 times their original investment."
we need to get rid of affirmative action! enough of the sexism and racism!!
"Not into political burgers, I will be going to Steak and Shake from now on.https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/842368359056445440/photo/1"
Wendy's breakfast are really good. McDonald's are in big trouble unless they come out a new menu fast.
A lot of people on here are overly bearish ??? Makes me wonder... I don’t trust anyone’s word on here
CEO FIRED ! OUCH tomorrow will be Manic Monday McDonalds. Stock will be down $10=+
220 next station
MCD can do much better!
I performed the Modigliani advanced technical analysis and this shows the next stop is 173; this kind of analysis never fails ; strong convergent buy signal with next stop is 170; some resistance at 172 and then the charts say 186
"I see a headline saying ""McDonald's CEO says that workers might call the police on customers who won't wear a mask""WOW! McDonalds employees should have been wearing masks back in March and they weren't. Kids with poor hygiene yapping away with their mouths 15 inches above other people's food should be criminal."
Been holding MCD for several years now. It’s a stable in my retirement portfolio. I eat there 2-3x per week. Usually a BigMac and a Coke or breakfast. I’m lovin’ it...
Heading back to 180s
This stock cannot be held down; advanced Modigliani analysis shows next stop is 175
"world economy is slowingmcd is slowing with it, right?mcd dividend 2.56%look at when interest rates hit 3.5% (they will go higher) during the recession we are in2.56/3.5 * 185 = $135 per share.....................you certainly can't find $185 from the financials or the balance sheetPE 28 revenue falling through the floor"
Will continue to use my profits from CMG to fund my discount buying on MCD June calls. 
brave eaters!
"Try to get kids to drink milk instead of soda, so what does MCD do? Take chocolate milk out of Happy Meals. Diet soda better than protein and calcium and a few extra calories from milk. Way to go."
"MCD goog, Amazon, are my only plays now. I’m about ready to double down on MCD if it passes the $185 resistance."
.16 positive McD.Should be up .25
This thing will hit $230 again
This will reach 190 to 195 before the end of the year
I bought 10 of the June 16 $150 PUTS....we'll see if I make $$$!!!!!!
Can someone do a security check on kevin? He got a big shorts margin call and hasn't posted for awhile.
McD sucks
Never understood all day breakfast. Breakfast is gross. Why not all day lunch?I like burgers and fries in the mornings. This is why I go to burger king instead of mcdonalds.
"McDonald ($MCD) is very popular in developing countries, because it can be considered as a new type of food in those countries. However, in those developed countries, like the United States, McDonald is not very popular any longer. Just now, McDonald said it will launch a burger which will totally change how consumers think about McDonald. Good news, but no ideas whether McDonald can success or not. Now, from Finstead, we can see McDonald Quarterly Revenue Growth is NEGATIVE 10.4%.....OMG, BUT, Can McDonald new burger can totally make a change? If so, it is good time to buy $MCD now?"
Any chance for a 2 for 1 split?
not sure cost is the issue.....I dont want people handling ng my food now
"in a downward trend for now, looking for 147, then upward climb imho. good long term hold"
Hey dollar. Good entry point for McD is now. 
"Wel, I got spnaked with my trade yesterday, but was lucky to limit the loss to about $600.....still up with that $4k profit from last month though!! I got caught with that silly upgrade this morning...oh , well....can't win them all....but I know when to cut my losses!"
wth is going on....
"Wow, if we can hold or pass $208 today, I'm definitely getting a fruit/yogurt parfait.."
I’ll say it again... this ceo is terrible!
"Is the fake boycott over yet, I need a bacon,egg and cheese biscuit."
5 year chart shows resistance at $280 within next few months. Been holding it for 25 years and still outperforms all other fast foods. Wished I would have added Chipolte when they sold it.
I had a Filet o Fish and 2 McChickens today. Stock price should be rocketing up.
"Quarterly Report beat expectations on revenue, earnings, and both US and same store sales increases. Complete beat. Surprised the stock is up so little, but there have been several companies that have beat ex"

"I am an old fart and will continue to add to my MCD position during market crashes. It seems to be working for me the last 25 years. PS, I use to work at McD during the early 1980s, my fist paycheck. Still have fond memories of searing and flipping the burgers."
200 by year end. Easy.
"$mcd will continue to grow, people will continue to get fatter and fatter. Arteries will clog, stents will skyrocket but look on the bright side MCD will soon be at $300. invest in MCD the money you make will some day pay for your heart attack."
Down $4 From friday..
This stock shouldn’t be declining this much. Its supposed to be recession bear market proof. Not anymore...
"Huge score for office $MCD lunch buffet Friday. We had Filet ‘o Fish and Chicken McNuggets, and won free fries for everyone with the pull tab game they have going on. Coffee and apple pies too. No pumpkin spice lattes here, those are for *******."
The real pigs are the Fund managers who buy and hold 70 stock stock while the insiders sold all but 0.06% of their holdings well over a year ago .They knew how in this deteriorating investment environment it was a case of severe competition for a slice of a shrinking pie .So the cheaper offerings mean both sales and earnings shrink just as the last 5 years have shown That means Guggenheim upgrade to buy in September was only to offset the Tech crash which sounds like fraud to me
Lots of momentum on this one
now it goes green......
"""McDonald’s (MCD) said in mid-June that U.S. same-store sales fell 5.1% in May. The Golden Arch’s U.S. same-store sales plunged 19.2% in April. ""Does anyone know the plunge is compared April 2020 to March 2020 or April 2020 to April 2019? The article did not make the comparisons clear."
"Hold the lettuce, hold the pickles, extra marital affairs don't upset us..!"
How popular is McDonald's among young people? Last night I passed a McDonald's in a college campus near midnight. I saw the store was packed with more than 100 young college students with at least 30 in the line!
Cant drop a 150 billion market cap company to fair value in one day. It took years to get so over priced and could take up to a year to come back down. Make no mistake a company with less than 3% growth (going to get even lower going forward) wont support this insane valuation. There is a reason why CFA is now the 3rd biggest restaurant chain with massive room to expand into MCD markets both in NA and abroad. Forget trying to hold 200 be worried about 100 in the next 18 months.
Great recession-resistant stock right here.
"new debt since trump in office 1.1 TGDP 19.39Tincome maybe 15% of that, 2.9T1.1/2.9 = 38%""the economy is doing good"" ignores the 1.1 T extra debt to enhance the economyyou shouldn't spend 38% of the countries income to help the economy grow, especially when the biggest problem of all is government spending and debtduhthe interest on teh debt alone is up around $800 B, that is .1 Tstop spendingthe military is overkill, cut it 20% right away, get out of foreign countries"
Ordering from a kiosk? Are you kidding? Have you been in a McD lately? Not many people sitting there.
We may have found our support at 196 on this dip. The charts show 5 to 8% dips on the downside.
"Shake Shack is telling people that burger is dead. Unless McDonald's begins to sell Pizza. Most of the population want the Pizza delivered to their houses, not even bothering the drive-thru."
"Sadly I sold MCD at 165, I am happy for all the longs! I will buy and hold if it goes back down to 165"
"PE above 27operating income up 2.2% YOYgrowth pretty lowbuybacks are pushing the total obligations and debt up by 2.666 billion dollars (I think, check) per year"

Just shorted 2 blocks. Sell the news.
"I'll have a large heroin Dr. Pepper, please. lol"
"I'll never eat at, or take my kids to, McDonalds ever again because they are unpatriotic by not closing their stores.Their emplyees have not all been tested and should not be breathing on and talking over other people's sandwiches. Disgusting even in the best of times."
"If MCD offers a plant based burger, this is going to $250!! MAGA!"
"Everytime I see a MCD it has a line around the store for the drive thru (at least in Los Angeles). Busy means more $..This is going up up up! Stay long! You don't like the Kiosk, go to the drive thru. Every store has it..."
"MCD is trying to manipulate their own stock with buybacksand pushing their debt up up UP UPuntil now, debt is very unreasonablethey should have been paying the debt off"
Sentiment on McDonalds around my age group mid 20's has really picked up in recent years. People really aren't as down on it as much as before. People love it and I believe the supersize me negative pr as finally worn off..
Dont think you are getting a deal because of the sell off the past few days. This stock is massively overbought by every single metric known to man. Will be months or even years of selling to bleed off the over 60 billion in fake market cap needed to get to a fair value. There will be bounces and mini rallies on the way down but down its going.
"Very strange bookkeeping here.They start out with this statement ""achieving 13 consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales"" but rev's and incomes have been decreasing.Then ""comparable sales increased 4.2%"" but rev's and incomes have been decreasing.And of course ""Company's strategic refranchising initiative, consolidated revenues decreased 7%"" but rev's and incomes have been decreasing.They did increase the divi to fool the fools.https://news.mcdonalds.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mcdonalds-reports-third-quarter-2018-resultsThis is not good news people"
When is the quarterly results? Should be coming up.
When Politically Correct California gets their morning coffee this thing will drop some more.
good time to buy the dip
Here comes the 2pm slide..like clockwork
I obviously made a big mistake when I bought yesterday at 155
Bleeding on a huge market day..what a dog
I like to see MCD increase divs and get more creative on its menu! How about adding a belly busting triple Angus beef patties with Swiss cheese burger?
Will the CEO going hurt the share price or will it be good for it?Good for it - Investors might not have liked him. Bad for it - Transition is not always positive.Thoughts?
The thought of the CEO chasing the employees around the fryer causes me to loose my appetite.
Mcd will retrace to $200 shortly if that fails 190 is foreseeable
"I Was in Denmark and saw many teens hanging out and eating at McDonalds. Same thing in Asia. When I returned to the states, I added to my MCD position. Hope it works out!"
"stock is definitely going to drop, the question is by how much, and for how long...."
At least 200
"in one year they borrowed about $1Bin one year income went up $732Mthe interest on the billion might only be $50M or so, but the debt has to be repaid at some"
They need to bring back the steak egg and cheese bagel. The only reason why I went there SMH
I am usually short the market but McDonald’s is the only stock I usually never short; my target is 190
"MCD needs to clean up their act. I was going to my local MCD every day to get my family breakfast, for over a year, every day. Today I go and they treat me like garbage. Their (sh*tty) app allowed me to order something they haven't carried in some time at that restaurant. The person at the drive thru was absolutely rude and downright nasty when I tried to substitute. Bottom line: going to local places from now on. And sadly I own 400 shares of MCD......maybe not for long."
Wow a 26 PE for a company with flat earnings and limited growth opportunities in most markets. Combined with CFA decimating them on their home turf and you can see this as the start of fall back to reality for the stock price. Give them a reasonable 15PE max that would be about 118.00. 2020 is going to be the worse year for MCD ever.
MCD is going to get hammered with numerous leadership changes. Replacement CEO is not received well and doesn't have international experience. Analyst are going to downgrade and insiders will sell. This has much more to drop.
Testing a lobster roll in Milwaukee MCD. Tastes great.
Nike is tanking huge second day in a row and consumer sentiment fell big unexpectedly as consumers tapped out !! Mcdonalds is hugely overpriced for the big slowdown in retail sales !https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-consumer-sentiment-unexpectedly-falls-in-june-496319
This stock has done nothing but go up for decades and has a fantastic dividend.
26 pe for slow growth and slaes in a downtrend. Expanding stores with lower volume is stupid. Own puts for a $75 drop when a few institutions wake up.
"My employees wanted the same setup that Trump gave Clemson. So we had 50 Big MCs, 50 Filet o Fish and lots of fries plus about 100 pies from $MCD at yesterday’s lunch buffet. We gave Trump the idea. Pelosi is an asshat and everyone knows it."
"Can anyone tell me how to access the ""Insider Transaction"" button?"

Why did MCD only go up $1.

Wait till Americans realize the damage this virus has done...McDonald's will go down with all the rest...Tick tock..
McD is the best restaurant company ; will reach 200 sometime this year; provides good value and that is why is growing
#$%$ in my burger
If it makes you feel better $MCD and $DNKN are down too so not worried about $SBUX
Great stock to own if you don't care about making a profit on your investment!
way oversold!
The thing about $MCD is they have great real estate and lots of hot chicks work there too. Impressive combo.
Wondered what would finally derail this stock-this wasn't on my list of possibilities.
waste of a great earnings???
"Endless lines of cars at the drivethru 24/7. Non ending. Lunchtime - 40 to 60 cars at a time.btw.. once a month even I have to get a cheeseburger, fries and strawberry shake, oh well."
"Boy down every day since earnings on stellar results, while market is going up. F me."
Food is definitely getting much better and every McDonald’s is more busy every day; self ordering kiosks are great; good food at reasonable prices; this stock should go to 200
"Folks, bad times ahead for MCD but its a BUY at $100"
Easterbrook should have been fired last year. THIS STOCK NEEDS TO SPLIT!!!!!
I think Mcdonalds is becoming the focal point of this movement which is gaining momentum as the 1% suck all the money out of the low income workers..I think this will go back towards 99 per share soon on this...http://fightfor15.org/november29/
"Just bought my first (small) McDonald's stake; 10 shares at $187.99.MCD's business is impressive. It's not really a restaurant; it's a supply chain, real estate, and branding company. I love how it has outsourced the messy, capital-intensive side of things to the franchisee. It's high-return and capital-light. Easterbrook did a good job, and his departure shows that the board is effective."
NOT lovin’ it today
MCD will be providing drive thru COVID-19 testing. You get a free value meal with the kit !
forming a cup in the stock chart.. going higher to complete the pattern. strong buy
I think MCD will be down 3% today. The earnings is not impressive after share price gaining 20% in the past few months.
What is MCD doing to ensure their growth for the future? And has anyone seen this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrDEtSlqJC4&t=1327s What a world we live in.

"3.5% 10 year rate(2.59% dividend / 3.5% 10 year) x $165 /share = $122look at a 10 year chart, like bigcharts or maybe yahoo finance mcd chartIt was at $12 in 2003I looked at the earnings for Dec 31 2015 to Dec 31 2017. 14.6% growthforget revenue1.073 to the 15th power (15 years) = 2.877, that's the factor for growth at 7.3% per yearit was at $12 for the low in 2003$12 x 2.877 = $34 per share, but of course it may have had better yearsthe high near the $12 low, was $30 per share, 2.5 times higher than the $12 low2.5 x $34 = $85 per shareMCD got carried away to the upside over these yearsNow look at the all time chart. I'm looking at bigcharts mcd all years. $130 is supportI bet it goes down to there. Remember at 3.5% 10 year treasury it is worth $122 per share.Higher oil prices push the market up with the oil stocks, but the cost pushes down on MCD, since food goes up, gas goes up, everything goes up with higher gas price, which don't always move with oil, but in general they will or eventually. People have less money to spend when they are spending it on gas for their cars. We still get about half of our electricity from burning fossil fuels."
Thanks shorties! Going to my local McD’s to celebrate tonight.
insanity in markets. All these stocks aren^t worth half of current prices. Its all smoke and mirrors. Same old games by Federal Reserve and markets. Playing games only.

creeping up to 200 again i see. nice.
MCD should go under ... junk food stores
Sit tight and wait for the downgrades to roll in.
Everyone is buying McDonalds.
I have been saying all along 220 for MCD. I performed today again the advanced modigliani technical analysis and now this is indicating 250 by the end of the year. Everybody was making fun of me when I first said easy 200 a year ago. Now 250 looks guaranteed. This analysis is very complete and rarely fails
"$151 per share2.63% dividend3.23% 10 year treasury yield2.63/3.23 = .814.814 * 186 = $151 per share value based on comparison to the 10 yearhowever, the 10 year yield is moving up, so that says $151 is still too high, maybe the 1 year low, closer to $140"
SHORTS MISSED THEIR CHANCE TO COVER & BUY AT $125. Those prices are gone lol.
I like to eat 4 $MCD Filet o Fish per day fro a week straight to get ready for my Florida Keys fishing trip.
this company should not be public this is a scam
"MCD's sites are pathetic. Franchises in California hiring illegals, people that don't speak English, and almost all people that have the equivalent of an 8th grade education. The word is out...if you're an illegal or have NO education, head to MCD for a job."
they tried to smash it down this morning..and were not successful in keeping it under 192..good first sign. If the mkt reacts negatively to yellow stain this afternoon..we could see 192 again...191 too..but Im hangin long here with new buyers entering on this pullback...yes its a PULLBACK..not a change in PE pricing of stock...me think anyhoo
Down $1.57 after hours is comical. MCD is making even in the worst of times!
"Just paid 11.67 for a large meal of this bottom feeder product in Hawthorne NV. If I had not been pressed for time, I could have had vintage cuisine for the same price.I’m not a happy consumer. You just happen to have ideal locations McDonald’s."
McD Thanks for the dividend and thanks to all of the hard working employees
watch out people...first was KO today was Heinz....yes you guessed it right.....sell sell sell
"Don't be fooled by the dividend increase. Look at McDonald's balance sheet. Pay attention to total assets and total liability. The difference of the two is called total shareholder equity. It turned negative in 2016. The reason why it turned negative is because long term debt, major component of the total liability, skyrocketed in 2016. CEO Easterbrook just borrowed money to pay dividends. If MCD is bankrupted today, shareholders will get nothing. Its book value is negative. Read the balance sheet carefully using the following link.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/balance-sheet?p=MCD"
"if the guy from seeking alpha wrote that articleall the major investors are aware of what he is saying and probably thinking the same thingmakes sense, PE too high and thats half what it ""really is"" without the buybacksand the buybacks look to come from excessive debt growth$106 probably is a good price without manipulationlook at a three year chart, two year chart, up way way too much for a company that has had is large growth cycle already"
"Splurged for the office today, bought everyone a Filet o Fish with extra tartar sauce, fries and a strawberry custard pie. We sent someone to Starbucks to get coffee but the line for the bathroom was around the block so we got $MCD coffee too. Smooth but strong, I liked it. Won’t go back to $SBUX it’s trying to be a sanctuary city."
McDonald's is down 6.28% to 186.37
I am trying to find the total dividends McDonald's paid out? How can I find out how many share holders
it looks like a cup and handle forming
Mcd sucked wind all week this week. Started out the week over 175. No rhyme or reason.
"No more McDonald's in China. The McDonald's China was sold to Citic Group in August. On October 25, the new owner has changed its name to 「金拱門」 (Golden Arches)."
"Bought mcd for nice and slow upwards unlike many stocks that have big swings both directions. Don’t need to make millions, just easy upward daily and most of all love that dividend! One of the biggest. Mcd will always be selling their wares for years to come. I am long and waiting for more good news come January 30th....."
"When my son was growing up, I tried to teach him about investing. I would buy him a few shares of stock and let him watch the price growth and dividend reinvestments grow the value. In 2001, when he was 13 years old, he specifically requested McDonalds stock. Except for reinvesting the dividends, that was a one time purchase. In the 18 years since, including dividend reinvestments, he has a 759% profit. As of this past Friday. I just wish I had bought him more than 4 shares. The original $144 investment is now worth almost $1,250."
WE ARE ALL RICH...NEVER SELL BUY BUY BUY KEEP IT GOING PLEASE
MCD is down 11.93% to 156.00
I bought into $MCD this morning...maybe that will be my Sea Biscut. or Silver Lining at least
"The geopolitical situation calls for the indices to sell off, thus the market to sell off. MCD just went up 9 days in a row or so.The numbers jump around but growth is maybe 10%.PE 25.37forward PE 19.68So its over priced based on the growth numbers and the PE, considerably so.Dividend is 2.55%, but the 10 year is 2.8232.55/2.823 * 161.6 = $145.97, that is $146 per share based on the 10 year52 week range 128 to 179market has been going up for about a year and a half, so the low 1.5 years ago was lower; I'd tell you but my computer is running the virus program and isn't functioning too well right now.If you look on a long term chart you will see $130 sticking out at you. Maybe $145 is low enough, unless the 10 year heads up, which it might. The news said the Russians are targeting power plants and some other things. My gut says to watch MCD, and take a short term short for a couple dollar drop for now. It may end up going below the low of 9 days ago. The market might tank tomorrow, Friday, with all the stuff going on."
"As I posted yesterday, the pullback was short lived. Not only was MCD up a half a percent today but the 20 day SMA crossed above the 50 EMA at the close and the MACD crept up to 50. However it will take another up day to confirm that the uptrend has resumed."
"earnings per share influenced greatly by buybacks$10 billion a year, it looks like (from 2014 to 2016)From 2014 to 2016, McDonald's executives spent a whopping $20.5 billion on buybacks. During the same period, the company earned just under $14 billion in net income, meaning buybacks represented 146% of McDonald's total income.....................looks like $5B per year more recently annuallyWas McDonald's Massive Share Repurchase Program Worth It? -- The ...https://www.fool.com/investing/.../was-mcdonalds-massive-share-repurchase-program...May 10, 2018 - At its current cadence, this will average out to roughly $3.2 billion in dividends, and $4.8 billion in share repurchases, annually. In the last three years, McDonald's has effectively doubled its debt load, from $14.9 billion at the outset of 2015, to $29.5 billion at year-end 2017.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;now look at their total income for one year$5.19 BI think when they buyback shares, they no longer get counted. So half of their earnings per share is buybacks. Puts the real PE 27.2 x 2 = 54.4, I mean without the buybacks.Is that the way it is? Maybe I'm making a mistake, but I think it is correct.1/54.1 => 1.84% return without the buybacksI saw a return from last quarter, looked like $2.10 per share. Lets call it $1.05 and multiply by 4 for 4 quarters..0228 => 2.3% returnis terribly low...............check my logiclooks grossly manipulated by Wall Street and MCD management, to me,check, I could be wrong"
Hope it crushes earnings.

Nice dumpage
It's about time to start talking about splitting the stock. 5 for 1?
Up another $2.00 and the good news keeps on coming even with the downers that are posting.

"I noticed this on the headline news section on the Schwab site this morning, 1/6/2021 - Barclays adjusts price target for McDonald's to $251 From $245, maintains overweight rating. I will be curious to see how the big three chicken sandwich release does on Feb. 24. I still believe a brioche bun would be more appealing than a buttered toasted potato roll and like the idea of the trio offered dry with the customer having the choice of several sauces instead. I’ve never been to Popeyes, I occasionally (2 or 3 times a year) go to Chick-fil-a and haven’t been to MCD in over a year. It should be interesting though to see the reviews and how they rank to one another. What are you guys buying? I’ve added some shares to my positions of KO, MSFT, MCD, BKH & DODIX the last few days. Good luck & great investing."
What happened? MCD has never been volatile since 2015. And there is no news.
This is becoming a serious buy. Do you think the kids next door are going to stop eating MCD because the CEO has a girlfriend? When the dust settles this will bounce right back.
Tomorrow’s another day.
"One year ago, see the one year chart, MCD was at $147. There is a gap to fill at $177."
MCD always does really well even in bad economies. I think I will try to wait for a small dip then its a buy for sure
Guaranteed 200!!!!!
Overvalued and overbought at this point. Downside risk from these levels and will get back in under $175.
Buy on the dip under $217.00
I don’t mean to tout my own horn but have I been right or not
Looks like we will finish red today on a 240 point up day!
"I've travelled the world, and MCD is in every corner. When I'm scared of a market correction, MCD is my go to especially with the dividend in the mix."
"MCD breaks into all time high, think I'll celebrate with a coffee and hot apple pie %^ )."
Who wants a mcdouble? I'm headed there now paid with my dividends! Lets roll MCD :D
Buy all you can; this ceo is serious about improving the stores; the food is good and cheap and this stock next year will be 190
If you are buying at these levels and are hoping to make any money during the next five years you are either totally insane or a very big optimist.MCD is currently valued similarly to a technology dot com era bubble stock.
Anybody try their new donut sticks???
"Why is the market down after being up, its just crazy hedge funds shorting the market."
Most international stores don't have drive-thru. MCD lose revenue big until Covid 19 is over.
"Has anyone been to a McDonald's lately? They are not offering $2 Sausage Egg McMuffins for no reason, business is slow because the service is terrible. On Sunday, had to use the restroom and they were closed inside only drive through. Next McDonald's was open but the service was terrible. Maybe because it was a weekend but they have issues."
"Mcdonalds is a steal at these prices! people need to eat at breakfast time when you rush out the door, kids love this food like a drug,the biggest fast food chain in the world and people are afraid to buy this money mammoth? new investors are a joke.They pile in at 220.00 a share and are scared at 139.00 scared money make no money! you will be sorry in 2 weeks."
"I live in a college town. In the campus, there is a McDonald's and Chipotle. It used to be Chipotle is crowded while McD has few customers. But I saw amazing turnaround for McD. College kids can't resist the $3 meal. Plus $1 coke if they don't drink their own water. McDonald's is winning their customers back due to the leadership of CEO. The next step is to have more expensive items in their menu to grow their revenue."
they are not shutting down the drive throughs so thinking mcdonalds may soar from the virus.
I will support this company all the way! Free meals during COVID for Essentials - don't know any other company that offered this! Way to support in time of need!
kids want McD not Poke
I’ll bet MCD winds up in the red at the end of today’s session.
Moving towards the $235.00 target !!!!
"2.54% dividend2.915 treasury treasury will go back to 3.25 and higher, 4%, 5% even as the Fed sells their treasuries and doesn't buyback treasuries2.54 / 2.915 * 186 = $162 per sharebut treasury returns are going to 3.25 and higher2.54/3.25 _ 186 = $145 per share, which is right around the one year low, going to $145 based on thatand look at a two year chart, was at $110what happens when the 10 year hits 4%, and it will2.5/4 *186 = $116 per share , down around the two year low, where it belongsand the 10 year yields is going higher, maybe within a year, maybe two years. 4.5% ? I don't know, but it will go higher than 4%, since no one will be buying the treasuries"
McDonalds will do a 2 for 1 stock split this year or next.
Did MCD get downgraded somewhere?
Why is mcd p/e so high? Is it a growth stock??
"Just picked some of these up at 215. An iconic and strong brand. Sure, it might sink for while but there's no keeping it down. McDonalds will fly again! Until then, I'll just wait it out. I'm in it for the long-term."
"In my opinion only as a man or a person we all deserve respect and dignity as an individual or degree. We are all human. We could be black, white, Chinese we could have an orange face. We do not criticize or condemn. Every person is unique and deserves the respect and service. All of this should be provided by McDonald’s. It is not a five star, four star, three star, two star or one star restaurant. It is a fast food restaurant. It provides a service of quality food and fast service. It is supposed to be satisfaction guaranteed for the products and service. This is not guaranteed. McDonald’s hires thousands of employees that do not provide their satisfaction guaranteed. They have other opinions which could be a sort of racist bias commitment to the customers. That is when management comes into control and continue to act with the best service there is a fault in the system and that is when legal system comes in to respond and correct error."
"look how fast it fell to 144 last time it got this high2 days, maybe more, but fast,"

What is the fat content of MCD buggers? 40%?
"If a CEO has no relations with employees they call it ""arrogant and distant"". If and when he does..........they fire him..........."
"I was fortunate to pick up 200 shares of MCD for $ 80 a few years ago when ""they"" said MCD was over....didn't appeal to young people, the menu was outdated, etc. etc......wish I had bought more"
"its not realistic to spend your entire earnings on buybacks in order to drive the price upeventually the money runs outand a recession is comingand interest rates are up up up, mortages are up up upthey could suffer a debt downgrade at some pointother restaurants take business"
"Cramer just recommended the stock, how many of you are buying next week?"
i have many shares at 205 should i sell or it might go back before September?
"When DOW tanks, MCD will tank as well. The 10% correction is long due. And this time the correction is likely to become a crash (> 20%)."
Bulls trap confirmed
Manipulation again . . .
MCD was up today because CNBC scheduled an interview with CEO tomorrow morning. Normally CEO will prepare for some good news to announce during an interview. So many front runners bought MCD shares today.
"Barely moving, up $1, down $1"
A joke of a stock... will it ever move
up 38% from the 52 week low with a mere 2.2% opertional growthtime for a correctionMondayor today maybe
To the moon!!!
We probably will never see $200 again
"Don't worry. MCD has strong support at $153.50. When the next wave of correction comes, people who are now long momo stocks like any FANG/TSLA/NVDA will turn to MCD for safe haven."
Love the new table service. Presentation was done very well. I don’t eat McDonald’s but appreciated the new approach
"Net Income Applicable To Common Shares 1,415,300 1,637,3001,415,300 was the Xmas quarter, down from the previous quarter, and significantly"
Owning $MCD is like your girlfriend grabbing your johnson under the table at Thanksgiving dinner. Everything is looking up.
Will have to redo my modigliani analysis this might go to 250
"The new chicken sandwiches sux ... It's one and done for me and my family ... Chic-Fil-A is still number 1, Popeye's a close second ... the rest are a far 3rd."
Hit with a $1billion lawsuit...Ouch!!
$jg partership is $niu $tigr $iq $sbux $mcd now
Will they now be adding kielbasa to the menu? Go Chris!
We deserve a break today.
"Still can’t believe parents feed this garbage to kids, as well as processed trash"
Ny city Mcd employees need $18.00 an hour. Cost of living in ny city is Higher.
"An earnings warning. That explains it. Back to the $150's, which is still high, but certainly takes enough wind out of the sails. Current stock price models this thing like a high tech growth stock."
What do you think throw a few bucks on a Jan 2021 call or buy some McDonald’s? And I mean like a Big Mac not $MCD
"For sale 12,000 shares ask $200.00 Limited time offer."

A DNA test will quickly prove she is a liar who plays with her own feces, as will the cameras inside the McD. Disgusting."
I usually order three McChickens and a small Diet Coke so I can stay regular
McDonald's stock has not split in 20 years next month and is currently at a stock price levelthat historically has never been reached in it's history. Will be interesting to see whether thecompany may start thinking of a stock split to keep the stock at a favorable price level.
My advanced Modigliani technical analysis is indicating 250 now
"The EPA is going to be very aggressive with fines come Jan 21, MCD will be a target as most takeout food groups will have to concentrate on packaging designs."
THE SKY IS FALLING!!!
if it holds 195...we could see 197 at the close
"This was a $170.00 stock in January and now it is a $159.00 stock, The lines at all MCD are long and as much as I can see at the various locations very busy. Why then the big drop again today of over $2.00???"

"Interesting price movement, Sales down (9)%Massive cost cutting and shared buyback allowed it to increase earnings.This is not growth, customer traffic down, prices up and thats a remedy for declining stock price.Institutions own 71% of this company, they will have to bail sooner or later. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/holders?p=MCD"
Good company but current valuation to rich for my blood.

"""Anonymous"" is so busy here. was busy at SBUX thread the other day,"
October quarter earnings will be the kitchen sink quarter. But how low will the stock be? My guess is flash crash to $94 or $91 then rebounds to $100.
how much are we going up today? we all know earnings are going to be great!
WSJ laying off dead weight mgmt. final resort
"Buy wen, instead of mcd"
Do you guys think the billion dollar discrimination lawsuit will affect the price on the short term much.
Back to normal valuation: MCD is below 100. Its fair value in bear market is 70s based on current earnings.
188 close....not acting well.
what the heck?
