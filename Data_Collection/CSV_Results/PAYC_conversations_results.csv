Recent headlines and conversations for PAYC
30x sales? 240x earnings? What am I missing? Why did the company buy back $50 million of stock? I guess this was to offset all the free stock given to the management?
PAYC is up 8.57% to 214.48
$PAYC Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Neutral USD 260 » USD 330 Target Raised by Oppenheimer Holdings Outperform USD 405 » USD 440 Maintains Needham & Company LLC Buy USD 316 » USD 455 Maintains Piper Sandler Overweight USD 403 » USD 441

Why is this down today ???? Any news ???
I've never seen such an incredible stock with so little following. last post 14 days ago!? holy cow. this thing is amazing. I don't own and I believe I had it on a watch list a few years ago. Jumped on some others and now kind of regretting it!
"So many businesses closing, millions unemployed. This is going to crush PAYC. One less employee is one less customer. Could we fall below 100?"
Got some mojo back here - heading to 120+ after next earnings
What will happen to Paycom when millions of companies go out of business? They will lose a lot of customers
Hello Everyone. Any chance that this company does a stock split of any kind soon? Just curious.
Paycom Software is down 4.90% to 404.83
What was the 9% drop in AH? Earning leaked or something?
I am buying more share of PAYC on this dip!!! Great company with excellent earnings!!! GO PAYC GO!!!
I didn’t see that coming
PAYC reached an all time high at 236.07
"Is this stock going to go up every day forever? Don't even know why. It's not like anything new. Just another one of the dozens of payroll companies. When PAYX and ADP start going out of business due to Paycom, okay, I will understand. But their stock prices are going up too. Makes no sense."
Tech stocks bubble in Covid time
"""The human resource and payroll software provider reported strong top-line growth and took advantage of operating leverage to drive even faster growth on the bottom line. The prosperity allowed management to increase its guidance for the full year.""Someone explain why positive news on all fronts constitutes a 6% plus drop? This has happened to at least a dozen of my holdings in the past year. Am I missing something or is investing per fundamentals dead? This market makes absolutely no sense!"
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 427.39

PAYC is down -5.51% to 147.61
2020 revenue looks to be about 1B. 30% growth rate. Probably a double in 3 years minimum. Best of luck to all.
Lock in your profits. Congrats to those who sold at $135
"Last couple of weeks were a window into the future, time to buy!"

We need 218 today. Look out for the 3 white soldiers in the coming days
"I muted Escobar, anybody agree please like"
Breaking out big time. Shorties are in major pain. This time more than likely there isn't going to be a pullback.
what the hell is going on with this stock
PAYC will bounce big tomorrow!!! They beat on their revenue and earnings in their recent quarter!!! GO PAYC GO!!!
"35% increase in 3months?73%increase in 1year?1000%increase in 5years?You guys are all crazy......nothing wrong with a little volatility.Any investing in the stock market requires buy and hold attitude. If its a good company, with a good history, a good management team and good product then short term perspective is always misleading......That applies to EVERYTHING"
"What is the big deal with this stock? Another payroll stock. Does the same thing as PAYX, ADP, PCTY, etc."
Great buying opportunity here
#paycbuy with both fists
EPS beat by just 1 cent and revenue beat by 3mil ?
My kid went to work there when it was at $30 and told me to buy then. Finally got in at $190!? and again at $250. Great operation. No where to go but up.
"High of 260 in august, low of 190 in October, PAYC could be 330 before we know it"
Blimey this seems like a rather unnecessary sell off... based on what exactly? Urgh.
"I'm so tempted to buy more before it goes back to 110+, just don't want to sell SHOP to do it"
PAYC is down 5.96% to $121.87
"PA.YC seems to be over valued at this time, so I am expecting a pullback. Obviously I am short. I do think this is a fine company, but has a high PE and appears to be leveling off in earnings. I expect the overall market to have at least a 20% pullback within six months. The only stock I am going to remain long on is MU it has a PE under 4 and earnings at $12 a year, doing a 10 billion dollar buyback. Priced at $45. check it out and compare to NVDA which I just went short on at $282 friday was short on TSLA and covered friday for 25K profit. Good luck to everyone."
PAYC is down 8.08% to 199.23
"Crazy valuation on this stock. When growth slows down, 'look out below'."
unless you lose 20000
Does anyone think this is a buy in after hours at this price? It seems like an overreaction to what was a decent ER report?
I could have sworn this was recently over $300.Time to call the Ghostbusters
By tomorrow it will be back to normal
"Analyst Actions: RBC Capital Upgrades Paycom Software to Outperform From Sector Perform, Adjusts Price Target to $450 From $305October 21, 202007:32 AM ET"
Lol totally makes sense that a 100% domestic business sells off +5% on China fears. The market is stupid sometimes.
wow up $11 now dowm. forecast must stink
Need to watch the open today. If it breaks $100 that is not good.
"08/16/2019 Paycom Ranks No. 6 on Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies ListPaycom is the highest-ranking software company on this year's list with Q2 revenues up 31% .....Nothing seems to have changed, and if true, is drop in price really warranted?"
"PAYC market cap 14 Billion, ADP market cap 73 Billion. Management came from ADP. Imo easy double."
It’s a buy at 115.36 if breaks out with good volume
Paycom Software is down 5.22% to 383.91
I bet this on its way to $300+. Good ole technical analysis says so. I'm a long but this is probably going to happen sooner rather than later.
They came in at 49 cents per share. Zacks estimate was for 54 cents per share
are they going to beat today...surely someone must know something
Top in on these valuations are beyond stretched to be kind u have no edge putting capital blindly up here $payc $pcty
wow..thank God I didn't sell yesterday...unbelievable...maybe everyone should stay silent
Is paycom a good buy
Somebody has bought it at 347... What a pity.
Mr. Twillio we are trying to have an adult conversation. 2400 post means your a little troll living in mommy's basement. Get 9ff the computer before your parents get home
"For this stock to go up this much, it better be taking major market share from Paychex and ADP."
PAYC just might be the fad stock of today. You can make a lot of money on these fad stocks but know when to dump it. It is NOT a buy and hold.
shorts r getting fried. $110 next week
"It seems a buying opportunity. I attended a Paycom executive's presentation yesterday to his former HS about his life journey. He remained optimistic for the company's future, at least for the next five years, despite some tough challenges in maintaining the revenue growth at a rapid clip."
trading 101
These topped wake up $pcty $payc
I am still trying to figure out what the big deal is with this company. Unless massive amounts of businesses are switching over from ADP and Paychex to Paycom. Is this what is happening? They are leaving the big boys in droves to go to Paycom? Will ADP and Paychex be out of business soon?
PAYC reached an all time high at 229.70
exact same stock behavior like after er last time
Shorts....Its not going down...Give up.....
PAYC is down 5.07% to 224.52
come on short squeeze. $110 here we come
not even a new post on earnings day..no guidance...I'm sold...before it happens
Great results.
Buying on the dip. Too good of a company not to. This company will be at 400 soon if I had to guess.
History of massive selling on earnpump better dellvrebuy after highway robbers get done
PAYC is up 6.38% to 243.20
"Here is what Cooper Investors has to say about Paycom Software, Inc. in their investor letter:""Paycom was sold because the business is experiencing a very significant share price appreciation in a short period. We bought this great company earlier in 2020, however Value Latencies appear exhausted – to highlight this point Paycom now trades on 27x Sales.”"
should be 400 by summer 2020
Overvalued and over bloated stock. Fair value is likely around 50 for this name.
Why is it down on these earnings?
"This is just another payroll company. Nothing new. PAYX and ADP have been around forever. Tons of other payroll companies out there. Why this is even $290 is beyond me, let alone $342 at one point. This is a $150 stock."
My guess for the 4th quarter Revenue is =<324.36M$. Best of luck to everyone. I think this one may be going higher after the results.
Surprising so few shares of this company change hands. Been in 3 months and has gone up almost 100 a share
$125 + by close thursday. window dressing and this has huge growth potential ans high short interest!
Bull run is likely over for SHOP. Let's see if it can hold onto these critical support level soon.
Was hoping to hold at $300. Looks like $290 instead - we need to hold that for certain.
Why the haircut?
PAYC is down 5.14% to 216.97
Good luck everyone!
AH trading: someone got a steal at $387.87 as the current Ask is $439.44
PAYC reached a new All Time High at 161.57
Great earnings pop after some healthy downdrafts prior to earnings...
Not surprised to see a bit of a slow down here. Huge day yesterday
someone want to buy PAYC?
Massive job losses and the entire country shutdown for 2 months. This is going to hurt. Millions of customers lost for PAYC. amazing company but they have no control right now. Scary times for PAYC shareholders.
"Teresa, I need to listen to you everyday, to remember why not to sell."
Bought more and call options riding the momentum higher. Buy and be rewarded!

Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? Learn now at thestock-dork .
Why the drop
These guys will keep taking accounts from ADP and Paychex. Bring these two companies to their knees begging for mercy.
PAYC is up 9.50% to 199.13
"Up, Up, and Away!!!"
PAYC offers HR services and payroll...like so many other companies. Let's run this stock up from $20 to $180 within 2 years. Makes sense. NOT. This will settle in at $80 within a year.
ummm why the drop?
"Well I was sad at first, but bought more at $197, so I will take a break even day"
An absolute steal at 399. PAYC is undervalued right now. This company is changing the way employees do their jobs. Anyone who is bearish is absolutely clueless.
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 406.64
Exactly the same after hours behavior like the last report. 400 by summer
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 383.66
solid move and trend line!
good earnings. beat 1Q2020 when things were jamming. Next quarter's beat will look unbelievable.
PAYC will rally to $ 242.00 by today's close!!!
PAYC is down 6.91% to 300.22
I got in at 336 is it still worth it to hold on :/
PAYC is up 4.92% to 88.67
Up $11+ after hours...
Another stellar Q here
Anytime the share price drops below $300 IMO is a chance to load up on more shares. This will be at $400 once the rally gets going again.
PAYC target price is $183
PAYC reached an all time high at $170.00
This stock should open tomorrow 203---210 per share!!!

Love this stock
Good value at $85 for long-term growth investors.
$PAYC Target Raised by Stifel Nicolaus Buy USD 405 » USD 465
ID SELL THIS #$%$ NOW. WAY OVERPRICED. GET YOUR MONEY OUT
What is going on today? Stock down 5% after great earnings report!
how come nobody post here...this is a good stock
"So yall would buy a stock where they only have a 60 billion market share huh? PAYC, by stock price is already at 5 billion, how much more of the market share do you think it can get with all the other companies? Seems like a bad bet, and I don't see them in a position to go into other market shares at this point. If they were to do that, they will be taking some hits in short term."
PAYC is over priced at present and is due for a pull back of 15%. After that it is my prediction it will resume an upward trend after the next quarters earnings. If you are long term hold on and you will be rewarded. If you are in a break even or profit sell half and average down on the dip before earnings..
PAYC reached an all time high at 291.73
Absolutely killed it !!!!! Sixty plus $.
Beat and raised. What's not to like? It will rise.
"85$++ easy tomorrow, strong earnings!!!"
PAYC reached a new All Time High at 140.08
Bought this stock at the market floor of the pandemic...am quite pleased with my return so far. Analysts are too bearish on this stock. It is revolutionizing business and deserves more love. Am predicting a return to the $300s and then into the $400s.
Everybody relax. Not exactly a lot of conviction in this selloff (<200k shares traded this morning)...A few profit takers who probably should be in something else anyway.
Paycom Software is down 5.38% to 360.27
Almost 300+ Onward and upwards!
"not down 15 to 20%... including today (low = -10%, ~~~$288), 'only' about -15% total for the two days... last time PAYC went thru a 'disastrous' fall was -10% on 9/10/2019... you coulda bought shares for ~~~$205... today PAYC is ~~~$292...y'all make the call... FWIW, I'm long for the foreseeable future... here, Paycom is the hottest in the port, and i see no reason to pull up stakes now... (thinking about the balancing thing, but haven't pulled the trigger yet.)"
"We gotta hold dome support here, this could be buying opportunity of a lifetime."
I have no idea why the stock is getting hammered but it is killing me
Great company with massive growth. This should go up like AMZN.
Time to short this over inflated pig. 52 week high.... Why?????
PAYC will be destroyed once all these companies go out of business. I’m looking to buy around $110
PAYC is up 4.95% to 214.51
Gonna soar if labor market recovers $payc $ wday
"PAYC's balance sheet shows ""other current assets"" of $700mm for latest year, $660mm for previous year, $460mm for year before that. Anyone have any idea of what these ""other current assets"" are? There are slightly larger offsetting ""other current liabilities"". These numbers dwarf everything else, so it seems strange to show them under ""other"" categorization."
This stock should be it's own business school class.. gets knocked down and just right back up to 330 plus. might as well be 400 next week. beyond weird. Never heard of this company until a few months ago from tracking the stock. I've been in the tech industry 25 years. Bizarre.
High growth value and technicals went bullish on high flyer techs. Rough month. Earnings call next Tuesday. We’ll see what happens...
PAYC is up 8.97% to 115.78

"Seen my first Paycom commercial lastnight. First one I seen since I've been following this company. Crazy how a stock that most people have never even heard of is doing so well. Everyone knows who paypal is and that stock is half of what paycom is. Whatever the case may be, kudos to all who were smart enough to hop on board."
"2,000% gain in 5 years. I am speechless with the lack of coverage on this company. holy sh. PE 99 and no slowing down."
Paycom Software is down 5.53% to 343.00
A great company but the stock is massively overvalued right now! Should be able to buy it back in 6 months at $100 less!
All the payroll companies are down today
Paycom Software is down 5.09% to 429.21
My PAYC Share Price Guess is that it will be $400+ by the end of 2020. Best of luck to all the longs!
"Major, major trend break by institutions selling. Next level of support is 163.50, which will be hit by end of year. Watch and learn."

Has anyone tried to use the blue interactive chart feature to compare another stock. Does not work .How do you contact yahoo to complain?
Buying opportunity here
I guess this company will put ADP and Paychex out of business. Nice.
How low is this going to go??
"Still trying to figure out what the big deal is with this company. Competition is ADP, Paychex, Paylocity, and about ten other companies that do payroll and HR."
"PAYC has had a very good run, time to take profits. Remember the saying ""pigs get rich, hogs get slaughtered"""
$102 - we need to hold the $100 level IMO.
Bought more PAYC today. I am wary of buying too many stocks right now but in the cases of the ones where I am at big losses I don't hesitate at the opportunity to dramatically lower my cost basis. I believe PAYC is a sound company that is on sale for those who want to get rich off it. Buy while you can.
Payc will be at 128 by year end
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 349.67
this move isnt scientific or rocket science. just simply a growth company in right space...with low float and high short interest. also they r buying back shares on any amd every dip.
Great report. 225 in 60 days
Great earnings call. Exciting new initiatives that will continue to add value to the PAYC payroll solution.
Buy it on every drop.
I should sell this stock just because nobody posts
I cut this dead horse. Out!``` PAYC BEARISH ```
This is BS low volume and they just yank the stock.
Good report
PAYC reached an all time high at 305.38
Look at PAYC rock!!! GO PAYC GO!!!
"Zacks said they don't like us, so I bought more. Hope we don't do a ""PCTY""!! Good luck all."
"Scary stock. This thing moves a lot when it moves, very dangerous."
Back too $100. Big gap to fill. Will cover then.
"more and more people do business on the Internet which utilize Paycom services., Aloha. from Hawaii. Howard"
PAYC is up 7.86% to 211.69
"From CEO on earnings call last night: “In fact, Q2 was our best quarter ever from a new business sales perspective by a large margin, and we will continue to spend aggressively on advertising throughout Q3 and Q4 above the Q2 levels as we deliver our value proposition to our massive target market. With less than 5% of the total addressable market already captured, we have a long way to go.”"
Paycom Software is up 5.85% to 410.81
Buying the dip. 500 is coming next.
It might end up at 199 for the day
Feels like we've found a bottom this week...expecting good things over the next few months.
PAYC is rising!!! Big earnings today!!!
haters had a great day with Paycom.

Going down down down. Get out now!!! Before it is too late.
I've always admired the PAYC leadership team. II bought an ITM money call today and obviously I'm quite happy with it now. In so can someone explain how it keeps going up with such a high valuation?
"Despite three downgrades this morning, it's holding up, great sign!Paycom Software Cut to Underperform From Neutral by Credit Suisse04/23/2020 07:45:00 AMPaycom Software Cut to Underweight From Neutral by JP Morgan04/23/2020 05:24:00 AMJP Morgan Downgrades Paycom Software to Underweight, Announces $200 Price Target"
"If one reads the earnings call transcript, they discuss the shift of approximately $8 million in revenue from Q1 to Q3 because of the number of banking Wednesdays (the day they process most) (one less in Q1, one more in Q3). For the algos to cause a selloff based on a softer Q1 revenue number was pretty ridiculous. The analysts will recognize this and there should be a reflection in the stock price over the next days and weeks."
this company will see $220 soon. Larger institutions will get involved due to Strong earnings & Growth. Gotta Love it!!!
"I would think that, with the new tax laws and all the new features and complications, it should be a bonanza for PAYC and the industry as a whole, for at least the first year, probably a couple of years. I may be wrong because I don't see any bonanza reflected in the share price of PAYC."
"My guess is that PAYC is due for a pullback in the short-run. Yo you should really check out awesomeSTO-CKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
This is going to take out 500. I warned shorts to cover. Now it’s too late.
Backed up the truck today and loaded. 350 is dirt cheap compared to where PAYC traded at the highs. When the news is company specific I'll worry. Until then every dip is a chance to get richer.
Paycom Software is down 6.65% to 285.00
kinda disappointed
"Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) shares slide 3% AH following Q3 earnings beats with 12% Y/Y revenue growth to $196.53M and soft Q4 guidance (Note: I'd say ""in-line"" guidance).Q3 gross margin was 84.9% vs. the 84.7% consensus and 85.3% in last year's quarter.For the current quarter, PAYC guides revenue of $212-214M (consensus: $212M) and adjusted EBITDA of $76-78M (consensus: $75.4M).Related: PAYC and peer Ceridian (NYSE:CDAY) were recently upgraded at RBC and JPMorgan on positive industry checks and improving macro conditions."
good buying opportunity?
I have a feeling PAYC will see a pullback now. What yall think? awe*some*stocks just allerted a new stock - it beats having to dig online yourself for new stock ideas.
PAYC right now is at a premium regardless of the anticipated growth potential
"Just 7% down, why not 9 or 10. Give me a break."
Will wait to drop. Then buy some
Paycom Software is down 5.11% to 379.69
This hurt so much that I laugh so hard
"Could be another down day (11-20) due to the entire market (especially techs) dropping ahead of the holiday (IMO). If we see 100, it might be time to buy."
Last week they celebrated 20th anniversary party with employees

lol
Analysts and research firms got this stock wrong big time. They were all saying to hold it in the lower 200s. I bought a ton of shares in the lower 200s and am sitting pretty today. This stock is revolutionizing business and is a game changer. Shorts beware and get out while you can.
PAYC is down 5.41% to $139.61

PAYC is one of my favorite stocks and it is one of the rare stocks I have that are not in the red today (along with my. INMD stock). Definitely holding onto PAYC for the long run.

PAYC hasn't fully recovered compared to many other similar enterprise cloud based applications; thoughts? I suppose a good portion of their smaller to medium sized clientele may be impacted by the pandemic?
Great company and terrific earning projections. Buy on all dips.
And there we go. One week later and we're back on track.

"Tue 8/4/2020 3:33 PMAccount: xxxx-2590 Your Day Sell to close order for 3 PAYC Aug 21 '20 $300 Call at a limit price of $8.3 was executed at $8.3. For details, see order #23245 on the Orders page.Lucky me only took $ 89 loss."
Today again a down day. Shall I plunge in and buy small number of shares. Any suggestions? Would appreciate.
what time does this piece of #$%$ report earnings
"Wow, $GRUB just got DRUBBED. It did go parabolic last year. $PAYC, $TWLO are likely next to get drubbed this time next year."
I'm so confused why is this down the earning was really good
Dead meat.Moving into SQ
PAYC will be up big today!!!
New 52 week low today?? What is going on - market is up 200.
It’s very simple. This stock keeps skyrocketing and it went higher than it should of for the numbers it posted this quarter. That’s why it’s down today. Still a great company that makes $$$$ and I am not selling
"Nice ""beat""..... well maybe."
Down 30% in less than a month. WOW.
"Major PROFIT TAKING in the SAS sector..... SHOP, COUP, .....etcmaybe ......... look out below time"
Wow...PAYC is way ahead of itself. This is a $100 stock at best right now. Enjoy the correction when it comes...and it will.
Industry out of favor it seems. Need to hold $200.
"Big beat in EPS of. 86 vs. 77, beat. in revenue by $3m. Guidence Q1 $281m vs $289m, however 2020 whole year beats by $8m. Should be good tomorrow."
Withdrawing full-year 2020 guidance.
All in before earning
haters ABOUND on Wall Street!
PAYC is up 9.19% to 230.00
Tomorrow will bring the higher target price
Still quite happy with this stock - especially my $94 cost basis! Go paycom!
Staying long and far-sighted on this company with great prospects--in it for years as long as nothing really bad happens. Trying to time the market dips and gains doesn't work for me.
Crazy 50% movie in a month. Wow shorts clobbered on this name. Never short momentum that has high growth as valuation doesn't matter for these names.

Golden opportunity to add to your positions on PAYC. Be greedy when Mr. Market is fearful.

"Nice earnings ""beat""....."
overbought = pullback
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 448.58
Any buying at all is being met with selling pressure. Horrible two days to say the least. I’m holding but regretting I didn’t sell yesterday when it was dropping. Did the earnings leak?

Coming back off after hours drop. I can see green in a few days once people read the numbers. My opinion??
250k back god bless me
"I am no expert by any means, but I have heard that after a lengthy run up, sometimes institutions, fund managers, etc.. take advantage of the increased liquidity that occurs after an earnings report release to make adjustments and sell portions of their holdings. I have seen good stocks retreat after a good report and generally assume this is the cause, particularly when they rebound quickly. Who knows, food for thought. In any case, I still see PAYC hitting new highs. Looks like a good buy below its 50-day MA."
Absolute tank of a stock. Shrugs off down market days like it’s its job. Hop on board the money train if you aren’t already.
$15 bucks just 4 years ago. Never even heard of the company. This seems awfully shady. Buyout target by Workday or Salesforce perhaps? How many G dmn HR and Payroll companies do we need? Bizarre
"This stock is selling at bargain prices, folks, Excellent entry price."
Strange reaction to the seeming non-event news today. Wonder what is really behind the big drop today???
"Follow the 3 day selling rule. Tomorrow may be time to get in, We will see if she bounces."
Going back up?
"Seems to have a Software theme to this decline, COUP is trading similarly for no apparent reason"
Where did everybody go? Is PAYC buy?
The company no one has ever heard of... this all seems so rigged it's unbelievable. is there a better performing stock anywhere? I'd like to see it.
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 374.35
It reports in line revenue and earning and CEO seems very positive for the future. I'd not pay much attention to the after-hour actions.

big boys are loading up for the long term
PAYC reached a new All Time High at 143.50
"I've made some really good money on this stock since April when I got it at $190 and change. I am somewhat leery as this is up 36+% in the last month. 28 years of buying and selling stock has proven out that what goes up DOES come down sooner or later. Much as I would like to jump back in, I am cautious. APPL and MSFT may be a better place until a pull back - Thoughts?"
PAYC is breaking out! GO PAYC GO!!!
Rally caps on
Can't beat trading off of fake headlines.
light guidance though...
Nice move to a brand new high at 246 (at least intra-day anyway.)
Is this going to drop ever again?
just bought more

"CEO Chad Richison sees the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to gain market share.""Even though the month of March was impacted by declining revenues from our current client base due to the effects of COVID-19, we continue to see strong addition of new clients,"" Richison said in Paycom's first-quarter earnings call. ""The pandemic is exposing seams created by the disparate systems and that is creating a higher demand for the Paycom single database solution."""

"Great CC. At the end CEO said: ""When did they start and what's been the movement since? And I believe that's the most relative number to us. And so we've seen stabilization. I am hopeful that that stabilization continues. We feel good about third quarter. That's why we've gone ahead and returned to guidance here in the third quarter. And then we'll see what happens subsequent to that. But thus far for the last three months, our numbers have been stabilized as far as the negative impact on our current clients unemployment trends."""
"PAYC back on January 29 and said that it could reach the $375 area. That price target was been reached and exceeded, and next we may be stopping short of the Point"

"Well, this is not anything like last earnings report reaction."
"FYI, PAYC dropped about 31 percent from last October until it bottomed at around 111 by the end of December, 2018."
The shorts are losing their shorts :-)

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) _ Paycom Software Inc. (PAYC) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings of $12.9 million
"Shorts like to lean on the lofty PE ratio as a reason to bet against this name. They don't take into account that this company is turning a profit and is net income positive, their gross profit margins are greater than 85 percent, their debt is low and they have infinitely more net cash than they have debt. And finally, they are free cash flow positive and the free cash flow is 3 times the debt. Bottom line, they can pay down all their debt and still have plenty of cash left over. And finally, they have a competitive advantage in the way their software is revolutionizing the workplace. These are cheap prices compared to where it has traded. I predict 500 and above are in the company's future. There is very little to dislike here."

"The fact that revenue was up at all is staggering considering they're focused on hr solutions for small businesses when half of small businesses were shuttered. Not saying buy more, but selling here is stupid. They have shockingly loyal customers and will be around for a long time."
This will be 300 within 60 days
Buying this pullback for sure
UP $7 already this morning. Almost to $298.! Here comes $300
Whats the status on the stock buyback? Are they done or is there still a few mil left?

Oppenheimer ups price target on PAYC to $120.
There is no explanation for this run up in price. It makes no sense. This will be $150 in a year.
Earning is just so so.
This has to be the reason for the PAYC take down today - competition...only reason that makes sense...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-paylocity-pcty-100010116.html

Im po tent
"PAYC reported good 1st qtr results. However, they are unable to give forward guidance because of Corona. They did say earnings going forward would be hurt by decrease in client count. So the stock is getting hit in after hours. 224 at this moment."
"Anyone have a clue as to what is going on? Down 7 out of the last 10 days with no news that I am aware of. Volume has been low, which provides a small degree of comfort."
flushing out the weak hands
PAYC is down -5.01% to 82.27
$114.14 is next level down to support. I would not even consider buying until then.
PAYC would be a marvelous buy at $180 (10% annual return over the next 10 years). $209 is not a bad point if you consider that.
Go PAYC Go!!!

Paycom is one of the only software stocks I like because they can actually make money.
really?
Oversold on guidance. Wouldn't surprise me to see $325 range within a couple of weeks. Been long. Staying long.
Will anyone BUY this ?!?
this report after hrs sucks
PAYC a strong buy
Buy the dip folks this is going out to take out 500 after the end of the year profits have been taken
So like 3-20$ day to day swings pretty common on this stock?
WOW..pray they beat..or this could get ugly..
"VERY OVERBOUGHT HERE, sell and buy back at 50! In other words, great short."
Loaded the boat today. Long term this goes back to 500. I love disruptive companies such as PAYC...they are changing the way the workplace operates. More people to returning to the office upon economic reopening is another plus.
"Looks like if it holds here it’ll go to 250. Low was 210ish, high was 230. Just need it to hold here, rebound, and break the 230 mark"
Paycom Software is down 5.09% to 377.20
"PAYC has increased revenue by more than 40% annually over the past four years, and 38% in the past 12 months It’s hard to argue that a stock trading at more than 78 times its past 12 months’ earnings is a screaming bargain."
"PAYC Technical indicators are looking bullish. Fundamental growth and profitability are looking strong, according to stockFA."
Pushing the share price down is a good thing long term. More people will buy on the dip and hold for longer.
