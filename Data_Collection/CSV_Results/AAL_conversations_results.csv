If Parker spent some time trying to differentiate AAL from the other airlines it would go a long way. How about bringing back 32” pitch row seats through main cabin. How about getting rid of basic economy seating and instead bring back pricing more uniform. Stop trying to look like a cattle car discount airline. I will gladly pay $50-$100 more per ticket with 32” pitch rows and uniform pricing on seats.To date everything American has done is because some other airline did something different first. Parker needs to learn how to lead rather than follow. American used to be a leader but not anymore.
Gentleman’s load and hold AAL by EOW 23.50$+ Mark my words
Stimulus fund come in and robinhood gets money to play again . Aal will pass 25$ this time
Charles Schwab restricted trading by temporarily deleting the AAL symbol.
"In a bold move, Morgan Stanley lowers AAL price target from $26 to $25 and maintains underweight rating? With this news, there should still be no reason to sell if the downside risk is only around 12%, and the remaining 12 analyst consensus is still $41.00 ? AAL has had good insider buying over the last month. AAL may also increase their share buyback program, which would not surprise me."
"I lost all respect for CNN for politicising and fear mongering the virus effect. They are so desperate to see the trump economy crash. I have been a Dem supporter all along, now thinking about switching to republican side."

"AAL can reduce its' costs somewhat but it's costs aren't the biggest problem for AAL. AAL's biggest problem is its' debt. They can't reduce their debt unless they make real money and shrinking the size of its' operation can only mean one thing. Revenues come down and with lower revenues it becomes harder and harder for AAL to turn a profit, much less reduce debt. The fat lady hasn't sung yet but pretty soon she's going to burst into song."
"As many as 20 million Americans could be inoculated against the coronavirus before the end of the year — and the number jumps to 80 million by March — if the government hits the target deadlines of the vaccine campaign’s top scientist, Moncef Slaoui.Slaoui’s schedule put the number of monthly vaccines at 25 million to 30 million a month, starting in January. At that pace, roughly a fourth of the population could be vaccinated before spring, Business Insider reported."
Should I purchase AA stocks right now or just wait? Will it be going down? Would love to hear people's thought on this!
Why so red ?
"It's really hard to invest where the Big Boys aren't interested. Look at the oil market here. There is zero reason for anyone to get excited about any shortage in oil supply. Yet the Big Boys WANT to be excited: they're rallying oil despite any evidence that the oversupply is ending. I wrote yesterday about my personal observations of oil production activity in the Permian, and the EIA has now confirmed this. For now, West Texas is an unstoppable oil production machine. It's the oil equivalent of Scott Kirby deciding to replace UAL's domestic fleet with all 787s. If Kirby did that, we'd all know that supply would exceed demand. Yet the oil market is willing to turn a blind eye to reality. In the airline sector, we could really use some investors like that!"
"I am bidding $11.96 1,000 shares (all or none) FILL ITOnly good for 16 minutes"
I think this could very easily go up quick but I think it has great potential for downspilling as well. All will tell I bought 40 puts for .2 cents so either way not much lost
Too bad the airline equities reacted as they did right after buffet's selloff announcement. i wonder what really motivated him.
"I just bought a bunch of shares. First time buyer. Crossing my fingers. I only buy stocks with short, med, long term outlook being positive."
Will rise on vaccine news which is picking up now. People will book flights like crazy on FDA approval of Pfizer vaccine. Moderna vaccine close behind and boosts supplies and distribution. Other companies with vaccines to further boost supplies. Antibody therapies too. AAL will boom on the medical advances. Everyone tired of being locked down. Latent demand is out of sight.
"Yesterday saw the Highest Pax for Saturday showing with 1,128,773 passengers traveling,..."
We did so well today. We were able to reverse 6% down that we started with in the morning and are breaking even by close. Very good on AAL part and this is a bullish trend. I also noticed some big orders coming through and maybe the hedge funds are now buying into the stock. I think this will continue to ride up now and can get into $22 soon.
Can someone give me quick summary of why UAL is trading at $90 and why AAL is below $40?
"Biggest problem I see with AAL is the company does not know how to price airfares competively. Flying from a AAL hub city is more expensive than flying a competitor. Worse, to beat a competitors price AAL wants me to make two connections and make it a 15 hour flight."
"Most of AAL's debt consists of sinking pass through trusts (guaranteed by underlying aircraft) but I did notice we have a couple sizeable bullet maturities coming up, 750mm 10/1/19 and 500mm on 3/1/20. Any idea if AAL is going to try to pay these off with cash, or refi? Could be a reason they have slowed the buybacks down, if they are building up cash to deleverage. However rates have come down substnatially so the refi could be the best option. Only variable there is if the market wants AAL to delever. But if they can refi at sub 5% rates it's hard to argue with that..."
"If Buffett didn’t buy any stocks when the market hit the lows in March 18th having $138 billion in cash , that tells us Buffett his old and has lost his mojo for sure !! AAL is a buy... the new generation will not get stuck inside they like to travel and move around. The only way to do that is by Airplane  period. The USA  economy will be roaring back and stronger than ever. Wait till we start bringing Back manufacturing back to the states. Folks we all need to think and be positive about our country which is the best in the world ."

This really was a great shorting opportunity post earnings. There is no good news scheduled for quite some time....
American Airlines is accepting all the aid. keeping workers paid thru all this is really good. not buying back stock us really good. shareholders will benefit from this.
AAL won't have to pay any taxes until 2023 this stock will go to the roof.
"Unsurprisingly, the sausage is being made in DC right now. Cash grants for airline payrolls are reportedly back on the table. Of course they are. While Democrats generally struggle with basic real world economics, one of their traditional basis of support is unions. While unions are normally a detriment to the airline industry -- the unionization of highly-paid individuals is normally harmful to both employer and employee -- this situation is different. Unionized employees now enable airlines to have more votes in Congress than they would if they had no unions. So money will be thrown at the airlines. Hopefully, some of that goes to keeping the airlines in business, and not just over-compensating airline employees during this crisis. My best guess is that money will be wasted all around, since that's what usually happens to ""favored"" industries. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cash-grants-aid-u-airlines-174035223.html"

"""Since early 2015 when airline stocks peaked, AAL’s share count is down 35%, its stock is down 25%, and its market cap is down 51% despite LTM pretax income (1Q18 vs. 1Q15) down “just” 21%. Contrary to prevailing views AAL didn’t raise debt to buy back stock but AAL did raise a lot of debt while buying back stock. So far, it hasn’t worked. The market will ignore buybacks it views as unsustainable if leverage is increasing and profits are declining. And we believe something needs to change either on the debt side or the profit side, and soon. UAL should be wise to this, too. ""King Fish 5/11/2018"
"One of the most important lessons that CNBC's Jim Cramer has learned over the years is not to trust all stock buybacks.""They aren't created equally and they aren't all a place to run to in a selloff. In fact, many buybacks disappear when times get tough and can't be relied upon, as we saw when [oil stocks] came crashing down when oil plunged in 2014,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.Buybacks are when companies repurchase their own shares in the open market in order to take them out of the equation, thus reducing the number of shares outstanding and boosting the earnings per share.Often times, buybacks are a way for companies to reward their shareholders with their cash. However, Cramer likes dividends more because of the downside protection and preferred federal taxation status.Over the years, buybacks have become very popular. Companies spent about $1 trillion more on buying back stock than on paying dividends in the past decade. Unfortunately, Cramer has seen that these buybacks have not given shareholders the value that they expected.""So, when you see a company with large buybacks and a puny dividend, you should be suspicious rather than bullish,"" Cramer said."
"Rezults: a loss of 5,54 Versus expected 5,86Revenue: 3,17 billion va 2.81 billion expected"
"So if you're focused on what possibly could go wrong fundamentally at AAL this summer (as you should be, since the market tends to pummel this stock on even small, short term problems), the thing to follow right now is the mechanical cancellations due to ""angry mechanics."" Something bad seems to have happened on Tuesday, when some mechanics reacted to the airline going to court against them by screwing up the PHL transatlantic hub that evening. As I mentioned though, this is a suicidal strategy for the union, because the court would almost certainly levy massive fines against them for an illegal slowdown. The union now seems to realize this, as there are now (surprise!) basically no cancellations today. If the mechanics will work this summer, AAL is going to make a ton of money. I presume, eventually, someone will notice this fact. Perhaps when the MAX is ready to go again?"
$20.50 is the new floor. More to come. With news of ALL the airlines/travel/vaca stocks jumping substantially this will bring in a LOT of people not watching daily from the sidelines. How long to $25? $28 and $32? Not sure...but I've bet non-trivial money on it coming! Covid is all but history to all those who aren't handwringers and EVERYONE wants to get the hell out of the house. Our international business travel is starting to pick up as well.
"Just throwing out a question: How much of this volatility (AAL ,and the others) is the Robinhood effect?"
"Everyone should know that investing is a game of odds. (Unfortunately, for AAL investors the past 2 years have been a terrible run of luck). If you want to play the odds, look at what's going on in Beijing. The odds that there's a materially different outcome in NYC, LA, Chicago or Dallas are very low. From today's Beijing expat blog:(3/3 10.07am) Beijing On Pace to be Clear by Mid-Month: Beijing reported 0 new infections yesterday and 6 new recoveries. For the 19th day in a row, the number of recovered patients coming out of Beijing hospitals has outpaced the number of newly infected patients going in. During that span, 48 new patients entered, and 220 recovered -- or a net daily decrease in patients under treatment of 11.6. If this pace continues (and given there are only 118 patients remaining under care), we could be looking at all patients being out of the hospital in a mere 11 days. https://www.thebeijinger.com/blog/2020/01/22/coronavirus-count-in-beijing#virus_latest_news"
"The oil market keeps acting strangely. Given the Russian comments (they seem ready to reconsider their production cuts and Donald Trump's comments, wouldn't YOU take trading profits here.

"pipeline back up, working."
"Many are painting a rather pessimistic picture and I am doing my best to synthesize their input and filter out the baseless fear mongering. These people espouse the logic the outcome of AAL is binary: either bankruptcy or eventual recovery. Considering this issue was not a product of endemic greed within the company or industry, in conjunction with the resiliency of the consumer, I believe this will recover over the rest of the year."
"Earnings season kicks in high gear, along with first estimate of Q2 GDP.S&P and Nasdaq are already in Sell Signal, only one Airline (ALK) has signaled Sell. AAL fell under 200dma again but it has been (2) above and (2) below 200dma the 4 sessions. AAL should gain 28c to take it above $33.35 Monday which is always a confusion day."
"Visual THIS: AAL’s pro forma debt service. At 5% average interest, to service its debt: EACH MONTH AAL must sell 52,700 tickets at $300/round trip. 52,700 seats a MONTH just for debt service. Not a single employee paycheck, not a gallon of jet fuel...before everything else.AAL not only should file BK, it almost has a moral obligation to its employees and customers to do so.Selling the first 52,700 seats each month for debt interest is beyond crushing, its demoralizing."
"They did report traffic a little late today!Delta reported October traffic with load factor slightly down, not a great report."

Bottom line: AAL shareholders get diluted, AAL adds more debt, AAL survives...US gov gets a Mister Wonderful deal.I’m selling strength here. This company will definitely survive, yes, but it’s going be a large debt burdened zombie that exist to service customers and service debt. A public utility."

"I got the feeling that Cramer was NOT condemning AAL's secondary move this pre-market . . . Cramer has lauded - and loudly recommended - that travel industry/hospitality/entertainment tickers ( AAL, DAL, UAL, CCL, NCLH, RCL, the casinos, LPSN, LYV, etc.) make a mad dash for cash NOW . . . while the credit market is just LOADED with CHEAP, free-wheeling funders looking to buy corporate debt and new issues.

Cramer, guests, everyone talking about how they are starting to “nibble” on tech, healthcare, housing market, staples, but AVOID travel and leisure.So no one wants to touch travel with a 10 foot pole, like they’ll actually catch covid fromIt. So that aversion is clearly reflected in the price. However, this probably presents an opportunity ... but you won’t see an actual substantial recovery until that sentiment changes.I reduced risk At 20.20, and added half those shares back at 18.94.

I don’t see one piece of news that justifies today’s index drops. Rosy outlook from Fed. Vaccine rollout is accelerating. Just a buying opportunity manufactured by the MMs I guess.

OINK OINK OINK! AAL just isn't recovering along with the rest of the airline sector. They also just banned alcohol on flights to DC because of a mostly peaceful protest. AAL thinks it's passengers are going to get drunk and 'storm' the Capitol. Was it 'storming' the Capitol when protestors took over the Wisconsin State Capitol for month? Nope. The media wrote glowing stories about them. AAL didn't ban alcohol on flights to Wisconsin.

And he notes how ALK has it's strongest market position in Seattle, Portland and Alaska. Hmmm, what could possibly go wrong with these places right now? Maybe riots and lawlessness aren't so good for business and leisure travel, and are likely to be a bit slow to recover? And maybe the plunge in commodity prices and cruise ship departures might not be so great for Alaska?

"I have been very busy in building an entry position in RKT for the last two weeks so I haven't been around much here. But, my comments I posted earlier today have also disappeared. This is what I posted an hour ago. Beware, NRTL!AAL’ share price is doing pretty well. Congratulations, Bulls! Remember I said earlier that my predictions tend to be as many as two weeks early. Last time, not too long ago, I gave my first warning 12 days ago before it happened and then I turned the red warning lights on 4 days later again before the stock price dropped from $22.4 (Feb 25th) to $18.94(March 5th), a 15.4%. I said that AAL was trading on market sentiment. We have seen just a couple of days ago, when AAL started moving down, 8%, rather quickly before it recovered. It appears to me the money flow into $AAL has dropped while the share price climbed generously. As you see the daily trading volume is low considering the price movement. I said last Friday that if the big money were behind the high call options, then the stock price would’ve stayed higher, which it did. So the same big money is keeping the share price higher currently. This contradicts the natural occurrence of how share price should move up or down. Take this as my second warning that be careful, and take your precaution before the stock price retreats if at all. Now, some guys misunderstand me thinking I suggest that they should sell their shares. Nope, that is what I say. I have been trading this stock daily for two years. I haven’t sold my core position and I won’t sell it whether the stock price is $35 or $15; at least, not for a few more months. There are ways to protect your investment if the share price moves against you. I have said that I had covered calls on my AAL long position. I posted it here in details. However they are deep ITM. In other words, I do need to take action for some of those positions latest tomorrow, and I will. I have collected higher premiums in the past but I will be collecting little now while someone did not receive any or a little premiums in the past may receive more now. But, you can also deploy other strategies. At the end, It is pretty much the same but all depends on when and how one has benefited from IV. Had there been new cash inflow into AAL, I would be more optimistic with AAL. Remember AAL was trading between $28 and under $31 before the pandemic. We, the longs, hoped the stock would continue to climb up to maybe $35 in the short term. Since then, AAL’s debt skyrocketed. That may not look as bad since the outstanding shares of AAL increased by 50%. However, if the share price was under $30 then, or we were to say AAL’s share price was worth $35 then, the share price could be valued 1/3 lower at best. I think the AAL is trading at the best level it is considering the circumstances. Everything is factored in into this price level, including growing PAX and other possibilities. However, I don’t know, maybe some optimistic investors believed AAL should have been valued at $50 then, AAL can still go up to $35. Therefore, this stock will not continue to trade on financials but market sentiment and the demand, how much investors at this point really think they can earn big return if they get in at this price level. I think, the big money supporting the AAL share price will eventually start dumping the stock on the little guys like us and reduce their positions once they fatten themselves enough like a dromedary. I had given $24 top price target a while back. It exceeded that level by reaching $26. Probably, it may stay around the current level with some volatility until “the fat man” has sold enough shares at the high level. Remember, more stakeholders are ready to get the value on their investments, AAL, the U.S. treasury, the financial institutions, and other hedge funds. Can the skinny guy feed them all? I highly doubt.Tomorrow is the expiration day for 3/19 option contracts. It’s a high volume day like last week. So here below is some information I prepared last weekend that may be beneficial:"
"AAL CEO is on CNBC right now....why he came on air is beyond me, has no answers on questions. Maybe non-committal is right strategy but then stay home. Lets see if drops now."
Huge run up PM before selloff?
"hey jonathan, when it hits $43 you can break even on those shares...."
Very low volume today on this down day. We’re probably a week away from the DAL 10k and about three weeks away from AAL. 4 of the last 5 10ks for AAL were released on the 4th Wednesday of February.

"AAL guided $110m Special Items, including $20m which is Non-Cash (Operating Special?, $90m Non-Operating Special?), Uncle believes that $20m is the line item on the Operating Expense, if so, that's the smallest one AAL has ever reported in the Past. The $20m and another $90m will be added back to the GAAP Pre-tax, but the $20m is one that's used in CASM-ex ""Special"". If that's also So, then AAL's EPS can be 20 cents higher than the Street is expecting. Pre-tax margin will also be little over guided 5-7%."
I bought at 16 so will wait for it to climb back up. will buy a bit more to average down.
"Here's why I don't mind joining the gold rush on AAL short squeeze: Low risk, high return. Even in the worst case scenario, all you have to do is hold for longer and it will go back to pre-pandamic levels. whether they will have a successful short squeeze or not, you are investing in a good company that's not going anywhere. win-win!"

"With a rating of Buy, Berenberg initiated coverage on American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL). The price target is set at $35.00 for American Airlines Group. In the second quarter, American Airlines Group showed an EPS of $1.82, compared to $1.63 from the year-ago quarter. American Airlines Group's market cap stands at $17.7 billion.

"None of the airlines are good buys after the recent run. If you want to buy an airline, sell puts with a lower strike price and get in cheaper. For example, sell the June 19 $16.50 puts for $1.30. If the stock closes below there and you have to buy it, your net cost is $15.20. If the stock goes lower, you can sell the $15 calls and make money as long as the stock doesn't plunge far below $15."
"I know that Daniel/Iahphx has a host of other ID's posting the garbage on this board. Only good fake news to hawk this stock is allowed but here goes,""...However, American Airlines is a mess compared to most other major and regional airlines. Even with coronavirus relief loans and capital raises, the company has about $41 billion in debt and less than $7 billion in available cash. That more than $34 billion in net debt is the highest in the airline industry, and it's going to cripple the company's growth initiatives throughout the rest of the decade, assuming it's able to survive over the long run...""You seen the folks traveling on AAL? there are no business fares being sold, only rock bottom to get a seat sold."

"Just flew AA and experienced their inept baggage check in system. Traveling with skis and boots, but was forced to wait for help because checking ""selected sports equipment"" . It took the agent almost 20 minutes to get stickers for each bag and allow me to pay extra baggage charges. So I wasn't surprised to read the title of a story in The Dallas Morning News ""American Airlines mishandled and lost more luggage than any other carrier"". I can't trust them to get my luggage to my destination, and I'm supposed to trust them to safely deliver much more important cargo (My family)! Never again!. I set a delta negative option position targeting 25 by March 20th. More reasons to negative: they're broke and just issued more debt with a lower credit rating than the competition. Also the Corona virus impact is still being underestimated (I'm a doctor). Short, short, short this stock !!!"
"When Daniel says AAL makes money at 70% of last year's revenues he basically saying AAL has or used to have a 42.8% profit margin. Does Daniel think we're all children under the age of 10% which company in the Airline business in America has ever reported 42.8% gross margins? Daniel, are you serious? Have you ever taken any accounting courses? LOL!"
"I was just reading over the latest 8-K presentation about AAdvantage. All of the recent moves made by $AAL are a desperate attempt to not spiral into bankruptcy. The entire presentation is about their plan to remain solvent, no focus on growth other than a ""hopeful maybe"". Their price was steadily heading downhill for 2 years before the pandemic was even a thing, ending around $26-27 just before things hit the fan, and that was good times for travel. Following a 2 year pre-pandemic trend, excluding the pandemic dip, they should be around $17 right now, and I was riding the highest times on that trend. Now? Now they decide to reinvent? The price right now was about right a month ago. Desperate attempts to restructure the financial aspect of a company while operations are still sinking, and especially while things weren't awesome without a pandemic, is not a reason to buy in. We cannot forget that they weren't doing great even before the pandemic. This is a desperate attempt to keep things from going completely in the trash. I wouldn't touch this with a 20 foot pole. Good luck bag-handlers!"

"Running the numbers with the new debt load, even if revenue returned to 2019 levels profits will be thin. If fuel goes up, they will be permanently profitless for all time. Unlimited liquidity won't save them. The $1 price target isn't far fetched from that perspective. Remember this will be a much smaller airline."
"100% No Reason that AAL is down Today!Even Donald Trump tried to joke about AAL's share price, you know it has gotten too low already!"

Giant dump today! sell while you can!
wow - dropping hard
"Airlines ain't the Perfect Hedge for the Market, today is supposed to be the exit day for the Next-Tuesday Long-term Shorts but they seemed to be Trapped by the Fake Selloff this morning.It's a systematic program (basket) dump at the open with the market pricing high at the open for 1/2m to 1m shares dump on each airline, typical trick as Cramer said how he used to do when he was at Golden Sucks. They should let Senior Bob to do the PR work talking about 1.5m to 2m PAX going into the Summer, we've heard Nothing from the Airlines so far but they surely will come out Next Week as they figured out how much they've paid for the Jet Fuel this quarter. In reality, this DAL not unblocking the Middle Seats still bothers Uncle. No wonder they've been the Doggie lately.Cover your Shorts, before it's too Late..."
recover soon to 22.50
"Nice to be back in the USA. The market is no more understandable here than abroad, though. :) Like I'm also trying to understand why the major USA airlines no longer trade in unison. I would think that on at least 330 days a year, they should rise and fall within a percentage point of each other. And now they don't."
"Saudis said today that they will pump more oil than ever and the market couldn't care less. Everyone just cares about Iran, because that's the bullish argument. You can't reason with the oil market however; unless the financial players are limited, it will NEVER be reasonable, and will just do whatever it does and no one will ever be successful in predicting its moves over time.AAL stock would probably have bottomed here absent the latest oil spike. But it's really hard to bet on it turning around now will oil up big nearly ever day. This is, of course, the only think that actually hurts AAL's profitability (even if it's mostly short term).I see Uncle is worried about a hit from the PSA outage. Boy, if you're worried about that, you're pretty much scraping the bottom of things to worry about. But I'm sure it cost the company something. Are there any plausible estimates?What's particularly weird about AAL underperforming its peers every day is that if oil is really going to be a problem (which still doesn't seem like a high probability bet given the Shale Revolution) AAL would be in significantly better shape than its rivals because it's spent money on a new fuel efficient fleet."
How much of the findings about trump move this market downward next week? I think he’s out. Could AAL suffer as well?
17 deaths in the US with only 335 cases?? That’s a big lie. Number of cases is more than 3000 in the US but govt doesn’t count to avoid panic.
"Trump is considering domestic travel bans. The game is over here. The question now is what will come out of this? I'm going to be liquidating my positions where I can, unfortunately because of my industry I'm forced to keep positions for 30 days. What do you reasonably expect from the government here? I don't think any airline regardless of management or balance sheet could avoid bankruptcy if this ban on travel lasts more than 3-6 months. The cash burn is significant. The only hope at this point is the government. I have no doubt something will come from them, but what specifically I do not know. Also do expect to see NYC to close within weeks and maybe even a positive result from Trump. This has moved at a breathtaking pace. No airline can exist without the ability to fly. The only revenue they can generate is cargo and maybe loyalty point sales with sales of aircraft and equipment but those all get slaughtered in times like this anyway. I'm stunned at the pace of this."
Why is PSP needed? Why should certain industries get enhanced unemployment and others not? We have a unemployment system that has worked fine for decades. Taxpayer money should not be used as an opportunity for vote buying. During the hard recession of 2008 no PSP was used. Time to let free markets work. Sorry but the travel industry has always been prone to recessions and this time should be no different.The travel industry has been changed forever and airlines need to adopt this new environment for years to come. Industries don’t become lean by giving the corporate welfare. Corporate travel won’t be coming back for years so its time to accept this business model and adapt.
"Pay attention to the daily volume and the change of open interest of $AAL in the options market. But this is what I had said earlier,https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/community?p=AAL&messageId=ec8ea18e-dacb-429a-bc02-df111af45cb4&bcmt=1"
We already know earnings will be bad and forecast good. Price already factored in give or take a buck. Up Up and away .....double+ by Xmas.
"Just took an American return flight from MIA to LGA. Fare was double, each seat was occupied. Yes, 100%. No service at all. In the return flight, each passenger was handed a paper bag with a water bottle and pretzels. Each passenger, as mandated, wore a mask. I hated it. Yet, here are facts that bode well for the stock:1) As lockout eases, Americans will pick up travel, we show know Tuesday from TSA data over long weekend. I bet it will double from the daily around 85,000 from this week; 2) Historic low jet fuel prices; 3) The government is looking the other way on social distancing for airlines; 4) What will take much longer to return will be international flights due to quarantine issues, but I think American with 74% domestic business should do well. Besides these facts, the statements made by Boeing CEO and Warren Buffet, are important negatives but I think above observations override these negatives"
Trump said he wants states to open but didnt say anything about opening up international travel.
"Oil prices low, airplanes full, fares holding up, AAL has fleet of new fuel efficient aircraft....AAL stock price trading around a five year low..What????"
AAL lifted from Robinhood restricted stocks!!!Time to crush the shorts
Friday is earnings day .My feeling is that we go under the 9 maybe lower .Now end 10 days
Not only major airline the Largest airline. Like Buffett says repeatedly ignore daily fluctuations pretend you won’t know the stock price for 20 years and you will be pleasantly surprised
"Oil is down, and so is the sector because of Italy and the euro? We've been through this Rodeo before, I believe it was Greece or was it Spain that becomes a blur...... such a tough sector to understand"
"So the thing about AAL is that even when it had real, predictable earnings, the stock could be worth anything the Market said it was worth. And, for 2 years, that was WAY less than what it ""should"" have been worth. Now, there's no realistic way to value the company: there's lots of cash and no revenue. No one can realistically predict the future: although if you apply any currently plausible scenarios, they aren't going to go broke. But does that mean the stock will sell for 5 bucks? 10 bucks? 15 bucks? 20 bucks? I have absolutely no idea. My strategy is to wait for more clarity on the virus. Once that's more predictable, history suggests that AAL could be massively undervalued at that time (because it won't trade on real facts) and the risk/reward could be excellent. Of course, this scenario may never happen, which is why this game is incredibly difficult."
Stock has lost 30% of its value ytd. I don't think company is 30% less valuable than it was 6 months ago. As a trade I gotta think risk/reward you can buy the stock now. Would not except a miracle but those numbers put out today were not awful. People are flying at record levels. Fairs are a little week and jet fuel prices are up but if you can get to buy the largest airline in the world down 30% that is a fairly decent risk/reward. Could be wrong but who knows
$30 soon
Way over sold we will see $14.25 today or by market open tomorrow then $16 by Friday
"the problem with these 30% dilution deals with mega debt is that you get diluted, but all the debt is basically still there. In 3 months they can lose what they raised. Now $14 is like the old $20. Shorts thought it was worth $10 before this. Now with 30% dilution the shorts think $7 is fair."
when is the conference/meeting/announcement AAL is speaking at this morning?
"Ah -sweet vindication/confirmation - I keep repeating it so much y'all gets tired of hearing it: AAL easily profitable at 70% of prior traffic. Here is WN saying they are b/e when double from here - double seems too far away? - traffic has doubled 3 times sinces March --Business Must Double To Break Even, Southwest Airlines CEO Says - from current levels for the company to break even, as demand remains badly depressed despite modest improvement in close-in leisure bookings.Southwest expects to burn $20 million per day in the 2020 third quarter (Q3), an improvement from previous estimates of $23 million, but still deeper than July’s $17 million daily losses. August operating revenues are expected to decrease 70-75% from a year ago, roughly in line with the prior month’s result, with a load factor of 40-45%.“I remain hopeful that Congress will get together and pass a second CARES Act with a clean six-month extension of the $3.2 billion in payroll support we received from the first CARES Act,” Kelly said. “That would go a long way to help us get to the other side and avoid furloughs like you’ve seen at our competitors.”Southwest now expects adjusted August capacity to be down 27% from the same period last year, a reduction from original plans of down 20%. Scheduled capacity will continue to decline in the coming months, with the company’s latest forecast calling for September and October schedules to be down 40% and 40-50% year-over-year, respectively.corporate travel currently remains down 90% from year-ago levels, --haha as most shorts keeps saying there is no biz travel......."
"So many desperate traders, too many...No real news for a short while, just follow the data, trend is good, momentum is also good.Read Uncle's Update and comment on TSA data everyday, don't fear when there isn't anything to fear or get too excited on small news.Have a wonderful Thanksgiving Holiday and God Bless America!"
"Every airline up except AAL. Kinda underlines how badly Parker has managed AAL. The largest airline now demoted to the 4th in market cap and the worst performer of the year.Watch Parker bring his 20+ years of airline experience to the table by elevating the debt and not planning for an oil spike. With a hopeful $3B in pre-tax earnings, what is AALs annual debt payment going to be?"
"LUV guided up RASM by 0.5%, ASM down by 1%, CASM-ex Up due to MAXs grounding.Results is only roughly 0.58% lower revenue.CASM-ex is 0.5% higher, also due to lower ASM affected by MAXs groundingNew Guidance seems to be reasonable, if not impressive, considering they have the most Maxs."

"#TBT TimT2 days ago""I have mentioned that I had bought weekly and bi-weekly calls deep ITM a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately,.......I have sold them as well for an average price of $20.65 this morning. In other words, I was supposed to increase my long position by 150%. Now I am back to my earlier position. This is also because of what I have said in my earlier post yesterday. Well, now, I hope to have available capital and I will write some OTM bi-weekly puts but not too far OTM. I can risk the recent gains from the calls. As of today, I am up about 53% on $AAL for the year, 2021. I will wait to see if the share price drops to $20 or below and write puts $19.""------------------I didn't really expect it to drop so much and regain all the loss on the same day but hey, this was a really nice surprise to me. I anticipate a pull back in AAL share price soon again regardless of what happened yesterday was just a curveball. But, you see how fast the share price went down from $21 to $18.74! I am just gonna get in and out of trades nowadays. I won't add any new shares to my long position which I have covered calls on them. I won't have any position in AAL unless the stock price drops below $20 or even $19 within 3-4 weeks. Let's see where the share price is gonna be until then.Things to remember: 1) The 2020 taxes need to be filed in 6 weeks.2) Any positive change in yields presents alternative investment opportunities to manage risks. 3) The trading trend has shown there happens a pull back once in every month at least. In other words, the traders will always have a better entry point that the present time.I think the market is going to pull back soon including the airline stocks in spite of the fact the airline index is probably doing better than all or most indexes. It has a gain of 25% for the year and 89% in the last six months however it is still in a loss territory, -3.5% as of yesterday, since the beginning of 2020. Maybe, the hedge funds will move the airline stocks up some more and then start selling shares once they are in the positive territory.I will wait low $18s to consider opening a long position assuming all my shares will be called away by the third week of March. I prefer short term short puts over calls. Meanwhile, I will do day trading."

I just bought my plane  tickets to Washington state for June 2, since my kids are out of school. Having a camping  vacation with the family. I know I am not the only one taking some time off. Doing all my traveling this year in the USA  to support this great Country of ours !! People are tired  of being locked  Down and will be moving around the country. Buy AAL and you will not regret it. Good luck to all the believers!!"
Anyone game for a little Proxy battle?
AA chooses to voice their opinion on boycotting Georgia because of their voting law. Now Texas is looking to follow Georgia. AA is based in Dallas Texas. Will they boycott themselves? Not a good financial move.
"So where are the doomsayers today? The only real lessons from all this is that it's a very hard game to play. I can only reiterate my advice, which I think is still very true, that the major USA airlines have a very good business model these days which should be successful over time. What is less certain now is whether Parker and Co. can outperform DAL and UAL. We will need more evidence of this in the future. I am sure that this quarter's results have wiped away any complacency among AAL managers. They're going to have to try even harder. But heck, that's why they make the big (mostly guaranteed) bucks."
Parker/Trump/737 Max...Triple Problem
Advanced Bookings with Free Cancellation when tickets are still available seems to be the Right thing to do right now.
"On days like theses I can’t express myself enough about LOCKING UP YOUR SHARES!!!It sounds crazy, but it is no joke...Words from Billy Bong Bong===Place your share in a limit order at a very extremely high price. Somewhere in the triple digits? All or none. Go until complete. This will place your shares in a order. By doing so it will lock your shares up. Preventing anyone from using your shares to short the price. Believe it or not? The shorts borrow your shares to sell cheaper. It’s crazy but that’s the evilness of being a short...#AAL #UAL #BA #LUV #JBLU #DAL #MESA #ALK #SKYW #HA #^DJI #^IXIC"
Wow
"Really odd that the Market has panicked THIS WEEK. It just shows you have difficult and irrational this game can be. Honestly, the crazy way AAL trades has saved me money because I assume everything will eventually be as absurd as possible. I never expect any logic or rationality. I don't think AAL valuation would make sense right now if there were 50,000 cases of WuFlu in Dallas. This week, we've had extraordinary news from China: WHO is amazed at how fast they are getting the virus contained. In the past 24 hours, outside of Hubei province, there are have been only 9 infections, That's amazing. And absolutely nobody cares because there's one (short term) super spread incident in Italy. As I said earlier, I would be a buyer here if I had any confidence at all in rationality. Since I have none, I'm waiting for the inevitable loss in interest in the virus."
"Everyone assumes Buffett sold off his share but they thought that last quarter and he didn't, and they thought that the quarter before and he didn't, and the quarter before and the quarter before. Might want to take with a grain of salt such pontifications posted here especially when they can't spell his name right."
"We are still seeing nearly 40% week-over-week increases in USA airline boardings according to the TSA. I'm thinking we'll be at 250,000 by mid-May due to the lockdowns ending. When we get to 500,000, this is a business again and the rebuilding begins. I'm guessing that happens in the first half of June, but it could be sooner or later. Just something to think about if you think ""Buffett matters."" Unless you're daytrading, he doesn't."
"$RKT The Best Trade Uncle has made this year was the ""China Long March 5B"", all above $40, then Genius came to talk about it here about what Big Guy has to Buy it since AAL's going Nowhere.AAL was simply in hibernation for a while, the China Long March 5B crashed. Very funny."
No one here mentioning AAL drastically outperformed its peers today?
"folks, it seems this solid company is hit the hardest by the pandemic.. 40% down, is that right. I'm thinking when things normalize, might be right back up to $36. Isn't this what we want to do is go ""bottom fishing?"" But are we at the bottom? Question lies in the bet: Will the virus fears in America fade as we get towards Summer or will it wind up as a catastrophic national crisis here at home? I predict the former. Is anyone with me?"
PArker or MOngo? Make your choice.

"Do not jump the gun. ""It depends. Airline stocks have moved higher in recent days, on optimism for a post-pandemic recovery. But, keep in mind the many fleas on this legacy carrier. Even before the pandemic affected air travel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs I previously discussed, American Airlines already had a heavy debt load and other operating issues.And despite the company receiving $5.8 billion in payroll support from the $2 trillion CARES Act stimulus package, they could burn through billions more as the airline industry remains effectively grounded.The worst of the coronavirus in America may already be over. But, it could be years before airline stocks like American start rebounding again. With this in mind, today’s prices may not be enough to justify a buy in the near-term.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wait-another-pullback-buying-american-165346673.html"
"It's all about Parker and Kirby go wrong direction, but, Parker does not have any debt due till June 2022.Liquidity is funny thing, DAL will have to payoff $4bn due in the next 6 months with the $9bn just raised, the real Cash Burn now ca not be used to measure how many months companies can last without refinancing."

"You didn't buy the stock when it was cheap. Now you want to buy the stock, which is high. This is a losing process for everyone who has a mind."
"DAL reports on the 22nd and LUV reports on the 23rd. Will you be able to weather that storm? Airline stocks will start dropping before the reports come out. Followed by a free fall with each report. If AAL reports last, it will be steaming south well before the release comes out. q2 outlook will be awful probably worse than q1. Q3 will not be anywhere close to where it was yoy even if the virus is gone. There's a solid 9 months of awful earnings about to open the eyes of longs. If you don't want to short this that's your call, but do yourself a favour and hold your cash until after the plunge."
Why is this down?
"Sooner than Later, we might see the so-called ""Revenge Travel"", it's been happening outside of America, for example, you see 100% occupancy in Taiwan, packed tourists everywhere ... We wait our turn, we wait patiently.Honestly, throw all the political nonsense aside, it we've followed NY and tri-State did, we're out of the crisis in few days. We still can make it to the safer society, Uncle begs everyone wear mask when going into crowds, old people stay home with Uncle."

All shorts welcome here. We can use your buying power later as AAL takes off. Remember the two day move from 11.50 to over $22?
I’m thinking high 30s by may

"Coronavirus Makes Airline Stocks a Screaming BuyThe impact of the coronavirus woes may have loomed large on the U.S. airlines industry for the past few weeks and still continues unabated but the industry is well-equipped to overcome such setbacks. In fact, steps have already been taken to contain the economic damage that this black swan event poses to the country’s major airline operators. All these actions are expected to be reflected ahead.Despite how the airlines industry may fare at present, there’s no better time to dive into these stocks than it is right now. This is because certain quality airline stocks are now trading much below their worth. In addition, the nosedive suffered by these stocks is a temporary blip that is expected to turn around soon.The fast-spreading disease has taken a toll on businesses for a while now, especially on companies that are integral to the travel sector, such as airlines. Airlines companies witnessed a significant drop in passenger traffic over the past few month as customers cancel their bookings and corporates prefer online meetings to face-to-face interactions.In just two months, shares of some of the giant air carriers, such as LATAM Airlines Group S.A. LTM, Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL have shed more than 65%. Decrease in travel demands across continents is hampering airline business.However gloomy the airlines industry may appear right now, the space is looking for a recovery ahead. Let’s delve deeper.Airlines Well-Prepared to Fight This Plunge: Here’s WhyAll these companies have abundant liquid assets to ride through the current scenario. American Airlines has more than $7.3 billion while management at Delta Airlines stated that it expects liquidity of a minimum $5 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and had $20 billion in assets that are free of debt. United Airlines had $8 billion in liquidity,Third, oil prices are a major factor that needs to be taken into account in airlines’ spending. Given the downward curve taken by oil, it’s quite clear that airlines are already saving big on fuel costs and could continue to do so for a while.The US government agreed a $25 billion bailout for the beleaguered airline industry on Tuesday as the coronavirus pandemic brings travel to a virtual standstill. Passenger airline companies are receiving direct aid as part of the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Cares Act) economic relief package passed last month in order to allow them to continue paying salaries and benefits to employees in the coming months.American Airlines will receive $5.8 billion as part of the deal and plans to request a loan for a further $4.8 billion. “The payroll support program recognizes the extraordinary dedication of our entire team, and importantly, sustains the critical air service being provided by our front-line team members,” Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said in a statement.Finally, according to The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) forecast in 2018, air traffic could double up to 8.2 billion in 2037. Over the next 20 years, the forecast expected a CAGR of 3.5%, indicating to double the number of passengers travelling from the 2018-levels.To wrap up, although airline companies’ near-term earnings may get affected because of the coronavirus fright, the long-term projections are likely to stay in place, given the airlines’ strong balance sheets and measures to overcome this disruption.In addition, the disruption caused by the coronavirus situation is temporary since several drugmakers are working on developing a vaccine rapidly. These developments are bound to yield results soon. As businesses return to business as usual some weeks or months from now, demand for air travel will improve. American Airlines has tremendous upside, only if the negative sentiment reverses. That may not happen until investors have a better sense on when airline traffic volumes improve."
"Let me correct misinformation about the airline business & oil prices.a.)the single most important factor is the health of the actual business: revenues, load factors, RASM, PRASM, etc. You all know that part its the most obvious: the REVENUE part of the business.b.) the next mostr important issue is costs; Personnel is largest and obviously number 2 but the most valuable. Yes, GENERALLY lower fuel is GREAT NEWS...but NOT FOR THE REASON YOU ARE SEEING IT TODAY.Fuel is lower because of fears of LOWER GLOBAL GROWTH, See item ""A"":--THE most important factor in analyzing the airline industry--the revenue or growth engine., In this case lower fiuel; prices is a marker for bad future news for airlines (AND pretty much all other industries).,Furthermore, because AAL I THE largest INTERNATIONAL player domestically--concerns abvout Europe and Asia hit the international aitrline the HARDEST.now PLEASE--stop with this conspiracy silliness about how everything's fixed against AAL. EWhen we get better new about global growth AAL will do just fine...at $60 or $70 or $90 a barrel oil."
"Doom and gloom. Have to find some rays of light, recoveries are surging. 218,000 up four fold in a week.East Timor is clear of the virus now. South Korea has posted 23 consecutive days of lower active cases.China traffic clawing back:""However, the trend in China is moving steadily upwards for the fourth week in a row. The lowest ebb was in the week of the 17th February, when capacity was down 70.8%. Since then it has begun to increase, coming in at just over 40% down for the first two weeks of March and even less for the latest two weeks.Week beginning the 16th March, China was down 38.7%. The most recent week analyzed by OAG shows traffic to be down 37.5% – a slow but definite uptick in capacity."""
The one way to get AAL to rise is keep Parker off CNBC and allow other CEO's like Ed Bastion from Delta to appear....when Parker shows up rarely if ever does AAL rise with any appearance...Wall Street has no confidence in the Chairman/CEO of the largest airline in the world and deservedly so...

"Steady increase in enplanements as more people understand that air travel is safe and are more willing to get on with their lives. Sadly, though, I see little progress on reopening borders. Eventually that will happen as everyone gets to herd immunity one way or another (like virus cases in Canada are now spiking despite closed USA border). I used to think Biden winning would be bad for airlines. I'm not sure now. Biden winning will be bad for our country due to sowing more Covid fear and lockdowns while producing no change in Covid reality, but I'm not so sure this will hurt airlines. Like it or not, the industry has now moved from being hyper competitive to one relying on crony capitalism (bailouts based on bi-partisan political support). That will continue until the Covid hysteria ends, no matter who's in power."

"""United Airlines named a Best Idea as Stephens transfers airline coverage. Stephens transitioned coverage of the airline group to Scott Schoenhaus, who lowered his 2020 estimates for JetBlue (JBLU), Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and raised his estimates for United Airlines (UAL), which he also named as a Best Idea. He believes harsh weather conditions and some pricing actions around the peak travel weeks created near-term headwinds for some carriers and he continues to believe in an overall lackluster setup for the airline group in the first half of the year. Schoenhaus also took over coverage of American (AAL), Delta (DAL) and SkyWest (SKYW)."""

"Nice panic we've got here. Remember, the one thing you can count on with this stock IS panic. And now there's actually something bad out there.Of course, it's nowhere near as bad as the panic. Watch the USA infection number on worldometer. That will give you an idea of what we're dealing with. Hard to say: it still does not look like there is much infection in the USA. A bad break could change that, but that's what the numbers currently show. I still don't like the Europe numbers. Too much new infection outside of Italy. That said, the Europe numbers show what we've seen in Asia: warmer countries don't get as much virus, and the disease seems to spread less. This could be huge in April. SBottomline, be cautious as everyone panics. Wait until it's obvious the transmission is in sustained decline. And then pounce."

Without commission this is where the broker/dealers have to maker their money.It doesn't matter if AAL went a sold another $1 billion, that is one less billion they will have to borrow and they would never do it, if their intent or only option was soon to declare bankruptcy, fwaud like that will actually put people in jail.While I agree with him that kooky Kerrie and slow Joe have endangered AAL outlook. There is something he needs to beware of and consider. The Amerika last party could easily jettison 50% USA ownership requirement. I bare no malice, it can't impact me at all if he wins or loses, but AAL was paying dividends and repurchasing billions of dollars in stock pre Chiner virus (f-lu joe).

"I have yet to hear a single argument why AAL should be pouring any money into buybacks. It does nothing to improve profits or drop the costs of AAL core business. AALs 6 years of buybacks are now costing the company $500M a year with the average price per buyback share at $44, which is $17 above market price!At the same time, Parker has let AALs profit margin drop considerably and both costs and the debt have increased."

Tragic that AAL doesn't feel it has enough cash to buy back stock at these price levels. But maybe Parker and Kerr will get ballsy when they see how much cash is rolling in. By that time, however, other market players are likely to have already dived in."

"Nothing too exciting about AAL's quarterly report. It would be nice if they underpromised and overdelivered, but I guess the aircraft problems and the gov't shutdown (along with the modest rebound in jet fuel prices) made that difficult to do this quarter. I suppose the short term fate of the stock depends on whether they can deliver, as previously promised, an excellent Q2. For shareholders, it was nice to see the buyback program reinstated. At the current rate, the company would buy back all its remaining shares in about 7 years."
"Bob, if AAL comes in like DAL and UAL with earnings and good attitude in cc, they will be rewarded as well.Remember, the Yahoo's numbers are still wrong, AAL has 9.82bn revenue and 82c/share EPS in 1Q17.They're expected to grow 6.14% on revenue to the tune of $10.423bn, and I gave them 75c/share EPS to beat too.Look into the RASM and Pre-Tax guidance to see if they're in-line with others.They should also raise their 2018 EPS target Up. $5.5 to $6.5 is way too low if they're due to buyback another 30m shares this year."
I have asked several times and will ask again. Can someone show me a business model to profitability?
"American Airlines needs to show they are liquid with the funding they received from govt, refinance debt that’s coming due, be optimistic with bookings due to recent state or coming planned openings during the earnings call and all airline stock will go up. Too many of these airline ceos are painting a gloomy picture because they want more govt money.If they were more optimistic and it can at least support the stock prices and give it a boost similar to the boost the casino stocks received off their lows."

However, on a significant decline in infection and hospitalization rates along with a rise in vaccine distribution during 1Q, the company recently has witnessed strength in domestic and short-haul international bookings.As of March 26, American Airlines’ statistics reflect a seven-day moving average of net bookings at 90% of the level experienced in 2019, with a domestic load factor of 80%. The company expects strong bookings to continue through the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter."""
"Good companies don't have broken stocks forever. AAL has been a ""broken"" stock for over a year … that may be changing.Jonathan and Uncle have mentioned the two gaps with one being filled yesterday. What are the thoughts about the lower gap in the $29s being part of an island reversal … it's not the classical island reversal, but did seem to happen with capitulation. I hope it is not revisited, or at least not until making a higher high. If the trading takes AAL back down there, it wouldn't be completely surprising, but it would be unwanted and anything can happen at that point. Otherwise, AAL may be leaving its ""broken"" stock status behind."
sudden bankruptcy soon

can you imagine where this would be if the Market was Up today !!!!! Holding until it gets back to its old highs !!!
"Went thru AAL new guidance and compare with original guidance, now with $215m special, the Non-GAAP EPS at 8.5% margin will be $1.62, higher than current St estimate, with 9.09% it'll come to $1.73. 9.09% was not random number it was the result using my formula calculating it's total expense along with calculated total non-operating income.Still can't come up with the $11.7bn revenue.Well, AAL at current price is already too low, it's not worth figuring out exactly what they'll bring. Very curious to know if Kirby brings his Bombshell."
Honestly who is flying these days when unemployed and depressed with the cv still around for real
I am predicting AAL will reach $40 for June
This is the reason that most investors put their savings to money laundry platforms such as crypto.. They are frustrated get fed up......
"AAL's short interest reduced by 18.7M (-10.9%) between Dec 31st, 2020 and Jan 15th, 2021 as I mentioned before. It appears that the short interest is on the rise over 7% between January 9th and January 31st. AAL borrowing rate is 42%. I assume it was lower before earnings. However, roughly speaking, that is $1.84 interest fee per 100 AAL shares. At an average price of $16 per share and 165M shorted stocks, it equates to just over $3M per day and $90M a month bill needs to be paid by the AAL' short-holders. Brokerage firms will post tremendous gains again."

"AAL has 1.8 mil less shorted shares this month than it did last month. It still has 142 mil shorted shares. If a mild recovery in shorted shares translated to about 4 to 5 points increase over the past week, can you imagine what would happen if more shorts are starting to cover?"
"Not that management seems to be overly concerned by the short term pain being experienced by its shareholders, but I would repeat my assertion that it would be a good idea to double the dividend. If the Market is going to completely misvalue this stock more than half the time, it would be nice for it to produce some income while we wait -- and a higher dividend would likely reduce the changes of misvaluation."

In the announcement it states they returned 646 million in value to shareholders in the first qtr. I must have missed that as my investment went down.
AAL will be very lucky if they get out of this virus and extended severe recession withou filing Bankruptcy. Their debt is ENORMOUS. Unfortunately I only see the stock continuing toSell off as more and more investors come to this realization.
I loaded the boat in the 11’s. People were laughing at me and kept buying tech. With cases peaking about 2 weeks ago the rotation trade was coming. I expect congress to give the aid to the airlines.

"As we all know, Wall Street's WuFlu response trading has been puzzling. Right now, what's surprising me is the general resilience in the oil market. There are a lot of unknowns regarding the impact of WuFlu. Like with AAL, we don't know for sure whether the savings from jet fuel exceed the loss of revenue from Asia flying and a possible (modest) downturn in overall travel bookings. The same can be said for many other industries. But what we do know with 100% certainty is that demand for oil is CRATERING in China, and materially falling throughout Asia. Add in all the airline flights that aren't flying and all the economic activity in China that isn't occurring and it's safe to conclude that ""the world's largest oil importer"" (by far) isn't importing so much oil these days. Yet, the Market NOW seems to be shrugging this off yet has started punishing other much less impacted industries. Weird, but the WuFlu whole trading has been weird. It's definitely been like facts and fundamentals aren't too important and that anyone who places bets based on cold economic logic will almost certainly lose."

I deployed about 10% of that this week into some early buys but I fear we have much more pain ahead. If in deed airlines get GRANTS next week, my sale of AAL at 13.58 may end up looking bad, but if they are only being given loans, then AAL will continue to go down.

"So when I quickly look at the weekly EIA oil numbers, they tell me a couple of obvious things. One, USA oil production is still rapidly increasing. Two, USA oil demand is essentially flat. Three, because we are producing about 1.7 million barrels of oil more than we did last year and are using essentially the same amount of oil, our net imports are down 1.7 million barrels (this is simplistic, but essentially accurate). So the rest of the world now starts with a (very significant) extra 1.7 million barrels available, a number which is increased or decreased by the rest of the world's oil producers.If oil were not financialized, there is no way oil prices could increase in such a scenario. You'd need either a dramatic increase in world oil demand or a dramatic decrease in world oil production. Neither has happened. So you have to presume that, eventually, the financialized oil market has to track the real oil market or more oil will flood the market and, eventually, crash it. I would suggest this means that a large, sustained spike in oil prices this year is highly improbable."

"AAL has an enterprise vaule of 36.5 billion is is trading only 10 billion, the most powerful brand in airline industry trading at such a discount, don't sell your shares to the hedge funds who are loading up their shares or will have to buy the shares to cover their short positions.

"Geez, the premiums for 6M shares of call contracts are drying up. Don't buy a call contract when stock is moving sideways and money flow is at peak RSI is medium but shows signs of coming down. I don't think it's a good time to buy call contracts while Q1 is approaching unless the stock price tanks and outlook is positive. Any other day to consider buying call option contracts would be on Friday, and it's deep ITM call contracts. I had reduced my core position by half two weeks ago thus I bought call contracts ($20.50+2.03 premium) last week on THURSDAY since the stock price had lost over 19% recently. I was assigned the shares over the weekend but I sold them near $23.80 yesterday due to high margin requirement and I had low available capital. I will wait till Friday before I consider buying calls again."
I'm under the impression that several airlines around the world will bankrupt soon. Not all of them have the protection that the US Goverment has extended to its major airlines and that will mean more business for the rest of them. AAL stocks value will triple in a few months. Boom there we go Buffet analysis is way off.

I purchased 5000 shares of American Airline knowing that Trump wants to win and he has to bail out the people and the companies. Normally I would say stay away from a money pit company but their forecast is so low and their future outcome can't be much worse that even if it misses I don't believe the surprise will sink the stock more than 10%. The bailout is certain but is more of a question of how much. I personally believe that bailout will be more extreme than anyone has expected to cause the stock to go up just on that news. Two years from now this stock is almost 100% to be trading at the $25+ level. Shorts vs Long. If earning beat the shorts will rush to escape and purchase the stock back causing a crazy amount of uptick volume. It was down $2.65 when everyone was shut down and scared to fly. No one is scared anymore and airport screening is at crazy highs. They can lost 7.56 and it wont shock anyone. Only way this loses is if the government doesn't bail them out. Last Bailout they told the airlines to consider the money as a downpayment. They have big plans for a bail out. I risked an amount of money that if I'm wrong I can not be stressed out. Please don't invest more than you feel comfortable with. If you are not sure you can always sell some of your position to lower the risk. Good Luck everyone and let's hope the longs win. =)Latest Earnings (Q1 ending 03/2020) Upcoming Announcement (Q2 ending 06/2020)Q1 Non-GAAP earnings -$2.65 Estimate decreased in the yearleading up to the announcement -2.40%Q2 consensus estimate -$7.56 Q2 consensus estimate is lowerthan previous yr's Q2 actual -515.49%

"If Deutsche downgrade is not enough, King Fish also has something to say""Airport costs are a big driver of what makes an airport produce high or low margins.

The AAL will fluctuate around $15 for at least another 7 days. Roller coaster is very expected at 170 million shorts. An above-average quarterly score and a rise in the TSA figure would be very squeezing for shorts. Let's see how this game will go on until end of January. I am excited! ;) :)

"So this is almost at pre pandemic levels, with the company being in worse shape. This are undeniable facts. My question is: why is it at pre pandemic levels, then?My possible answer would be stock market inflation. If this were the case, this means that as the company gets in better shape, the stock price will continue to go up and pass pre pandemic levels even though the company itself won't be as strong. Adjusted for inflation, $26 of today might be what? $17 at pre pandemic usds?"

"Uncle Buffett just celebrated his 2-year Buying of AAL, his First Buy of AAL was in 3Q16 when AAL averaged $36.14 for the quarter. The old guy bought 21.77m shares of AAL, he later added his stack to 45.54m shares in 4Q16 between $37.38 and $49.64 in 4Q16, and as he continued to see ""value"" in AAL, he followed up with another 3m shares to 49.278m shares in 1Q17. He later was forced by Parker's ""Buy till it drops"" stock buyback program to reduce his stack to be under 10%.AAL is now back to 3Q16's Price, it's quite a Marry-Go-Round for Uncle!It maybe true that Uncle Buffett really wants to buy the whole AAL, but that Huge NOLs will be lost on change of control.We're on the Same Boat with Uncle Buffett, some may think it's quite a honor."
"These past weeks show you how absurd -- and risky -- investing can be. Somehow, it always feels ""harder"" for airline investors, even if their companies are massively undervalued. As I've repeatedly stated -- accurately, I believe -- there are very few material risks to major USA airline profitability these days. One of those real risks is oil, because it's price has historically been quite volatile, and it makes up such a significant percentage of an airline's costs. In the current environment, ""logic"" would suggest this would be a very modest risk. The USA has just revolutionized the oil industry and is growing production at a rate unknown in human history. While other int'l players are (stupidly, IMHO) trying to ""limit production,"" the idea that there's any ""shortage"" of oil in the world right now is beyond fanciful. And now the market is fixated on a modest potential cutback in production of a two-bit oil player (Iran). At the same time, it's paying zero attention to a serious effort (Tesla and friends) to completely obliterate the oil industry as we know it.The ""problem"" for oil consumers right now is that I don't really see how the oil bubble bursts. Oh, it certainly will, and almost certainly this year, but how. The only meaningful and semi-reliable data we really have in the whole world is US production, shown by weekly production barrels and new drilling activity. Both of those are already -- and unsurprisingly -- extremely bearish to oil prices. The market just ignores it. Instead, it focuses on impossible-to-quantify factors like ""Mideast tensions"" to bid up oil prices. We all know that these ""tensions"" will have zero, or near-zero impact on actual world oil supply, and there will never be a moment where prognosticators will give the ""all clear."" Rather, having seen this movie before, we know that oil will start tumbling and the prognosticators will then provide an explanation for what is happening. Thanks guys."

"UAL had a chart in their conference call this morning that showed historical RASM movement vs fluctuations in oil. Contrary to some analysts, it showed that historically RASM stays positive with oil dropping $20-25/bbl.

Only way for aal to cut the daily burn to 30 million a day is to fly a lot of passengers more so than the other airlines which means taking away some of the customers. With vaccine in the horizon it’s a matter of time before aal hit 20. I was planning on selling after 10-20% profit , but I’m planning to hold on for awhile. Go aal. Feel sorry for the shorts."
"Just ignore today’s airlines hit job. American Airlines is increasing flights daily and has been flying full planes. The price action is unwarranted and contrived. Once the algorithms and fear selling is over, the price should rise significantly."
Anyone venture to speculate why we are down more than 6% while most all other airlines are down from less than 1% to 2%?
The Huge NOLs and Younger Fleet. The market has yet to give AAL some credit on that.
"As of October 2, 2020, there have been 233,364 deaths in Europe overall due to the corona since the first recorded European death in France on February 15. April 4 was the virus' deadliest day so far in Europe with 5,363 deaths, while on October 2, 653 deaths were recorded. Just so you know, as the media will never do a fair comparison. Even if Russia and Turkey are removed, the number stands at 202,717"
"My wife is booking our 1st vacation flights since COVID as I type this. Hitting Vegas in June. Booking of Cabo and several FL trips in the fall will be very soon. No doubt there are many others throughout the US making similar plans right about now. That said, regardless of whatever the Q1 numbers are, Q2 is going to be bonkers....just in time for LTCG eligibility."
Ohhh look companies Take on more debt... how exactly does that make AAL worth more than pre pandemic??? It doesn’t.
Another 10% dilution to raise 1 billion dollars. Since the pandemic close to 300 million shares have been sold. This is almost a 50% dilution for shareholders. The market cap is already the same as pre-pandemic levels considering the dilution. Currently millions of people are joining hands pick a 2 billion market cap company that has been heavily shorted and trigger the short squeeze. I dont think it is possible to try the same for AAL. The attempt already failed. In the current market not sure how much all these non-profit companies are really worth it. For all those people who made tons of money last year its worth taking risks now.

"AAL Pre-Tax dropped off $3B-$7B range, now under $2.8B...EPS barely beats the current lowest estimate of $0.98/share, Jet Fuel is guided between $2.20-$2.27/gal, looks like they missed the low Jet Fuel prices most of the December."
"The airlines could use a bounce right now, and then with the enthusiasm that Memorial Day will bring, another bounce up."
"OK.. very simple math people . United and Delta trending up in the past 3 years up to the pandemic month. American was trending down in the past 3 years, and at this price it basically at the price that it should have been EVEN if there was no pandemic. So, what is the means? AAL is technically overvalued at this price with the effect of Pandemic and slow economic recovery... of all the US airlines, seems the worse, yet most pumped price since it recent lows."

"Four U.S., European Airlines Urge Transatlantic Reopening, COVID-19 TestingFRANKFURT–American Airlines, International Airlines Group (IAG), Lufthansa and United Airlines are urging the EU and the U.S. government to introduce a common COVID-19 testing program that would allow airlines to restore a more substantial transatlantic network. The four companies wrote a joint letter to U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence and European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson July 21. “Nobody will benefit from a prolonged closure of this most indispensable corridor for global aviation,” they stressed. Neither Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM nor other affected airlines on either side of the Atlantic took part in the initiative.“Given the unquestioned importance of transatlantic air travel to the global economy as well as to the economic recovery of our businesses, we believe it is critical to find a way to re-open air services between the U.S. and Europe,” CEOs Scott Kirby (United), Doug Parker (American), Carsten Spohr (Lufthansa) and Willie Walsh (IAG) stated in the letter. “In addition to all the significant and unprecedented actions that governments and airlines are taking to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, a coordinated COVID-19 testing program could be key to providing confidence to permit services to resume without quarantine requirements or other entry restrictions.”Some European airports and airlines have begun offering COVID-19 testing, but they are still limited in terms of hourly capacity and, in some cases, test results are only made available after several hours. IATA said if governments chose to introduce tests, these would have to “deliver results fast, be able to be conducted at scale and operate to very high rates of accuracy.” IATA stressed that passengers should not be charged for mandatory tests. Also, the global airline trade body said June 30 it believes “testing for COVID-19 is not a necessary condition for reopening borders and/or resuming air service operations.” While U.S. airlines have increased domestic capacity, they are still offering only a skeleton long-haul network. Likewise, European carriers have started rebuilding their intra-European network first, but most want to add back long-haul and transatlantic capacity beginning in September. The big European legacy airline groups are also dependent on long-haul connecting passengers as they add short-haul capacity. Transatlantic flying is typically the most profitable business for many of them during normal times.When the EU recommended lifting restrictions for travelers from 14 non-European countries to its member states on July 1, the U.S. was not on the list, given the high number of new COVID-19 infections. The U.S. also has a travel ban for Europeans in place that includes very few exceptions. During the first biweekly review of the list on July 16 the U.S. was still not added and Montenegro and Serbia were removed, therefore the ban will remain in place until at least the end of July. The EU has said it will only open up for countries that have similar or lower infection rates than the EU member states themselves. Intra-EU restrictions were abandoned earlier.The CEOs wrote that “a coordinated COVID-19 testing program could be key to providing confidence to permit services to resume without quarantine requirements or other entry restrictions. COVID-19 testing is becoming more and more common throughout the world as a tool to avoid these other more intrusive measures.” The four executives “recognize that testing presents a number of challenges, however we believe that a pilot testing program for the transatlantic market could be an excellent opportunity for government and industry to work together and find ways to overcome obstacles and explore all solutions to protect health, build confidence, and safely restore passenger travel between the U.S. and Europe.” Flottau"

Good Behaviour on a bad day for the market. Hopefully we are going to see higher the share. It seems the investors are placing bets for higher. The volumes also not bad
soon to be 30$+ Lets GOOOO UP
I just picked up 3000 more shares. Pray for the Fat Orange Baby to sign the relief package. 
Will be 20% drop next week.
Let us all hope AAL has been chosen as the next GME!
I am long AAL with two purchases at $10.50 and $8.30 (the second will be realized if the price stays under $9.00 this coming week) but I feel very pessimistic. I envy the more optimistic members of this board.
"I'm still trying to understand how this stock can trade the way it is here. No one could apply rational cognitive thinking and suddenly decide that the stock is ""worthless"" based on the actual fundamentals currently determinable. All the execs just ""bought in"" with their own money a few weeks ago at a much higher price, and the company's fundamentals have improved since then. A member of the BoD just bought this week at a much higher price! If you look at the analysts reports, they all show a high earnings growth rate despite a record low p/e, It simply doesn't add up. It leads me to believe that there is some algorithmic program that crushes all buying interest in the stock and drives down the price. The lack of rationality drives potential investors (like me) away, furthering the decline. Does anyone have a better theory?"
"only one in the red, again."
"Hi everybody.I almost bought some options this morning while stock was $32.5 level, but they were not cheap, than got to following my DWT which had a great day wiping my losses and getting to a small gain.I expected AAL to go up toward $36, but max grounding, fuel cost guidance, business class customer satisfaction better for DAl etc may have effected"
"At current prices ($27.02) and midpoint of management earning guidance ($5.25 per share), AAL has an earnings yield of 19.4%. That is an amazing figure. Not_A_Short"
"This is the 4th time , AAL did NOT sell-off after reports, like 2Q18, 3Q18, 4Q18...The report came very little short of Uncle's estimate, $4m by revenue and $1 by EPS.AAL repurchased 7.27m shares, higher than 6.5m Uncle has figured from the liquidity they guided on 10/9.AAL still has $850m left for repurchasing.They have so far killed off 303.2m shares, with $12.163bn of our money at avg $40.11/share. Amazing Buying Machine."

"People will never change, Uncle GreenSpan's onced said""It has become evident time and again that when events become too complex and move too rapidly as appears to be the case today, human beings become demonstably less able to cope. The failure of the ability to comprehend external events almost invariably induces disengagement from an activity, whether it be fear of entering a dark room, or of market volatility. And disengagement from market that are net long, the most general case, means bids are hit and prices fall.Once you get a decline started, it's not clear whether people choose that as a reason to sell or to buy?"""

"AAL might be a buy - but with third wave just starting and most states (and the orld) will issue stay at home orders for the next 4-6 weeks and with today's news from AAL seeing ""Slowing Demand Amid Surge In COVID-19 Cases""- do you think 2-3 weeks wait for the price to settle might be a good idea ?"
"It's coming up to that time of the year, when DAL reports first, followed by UAL, with AAL bringing up the rear. Statistically all airlines rise on ""king"" DAL, fall on ""capacity glut"" UAL, and then AAL tanks over 10% after Parker speaks."
"I don't think the speculators who are bidding up oil on ""geopolitical tensions"" are doing the oil industry -- and the Saudis -- any favors. This has the feeling of the ""last rally."" Remember, the last time oil prices came completely unhinged from actual fundamentals, the fracking industry was born. This time, it's cementing the USA as the world's largest oil producer -- with nearly limitless production -- and giving a much needed boost to Elon Musk and friends who intend to permanently destroy the oil industry. Just today, there's a headline on oilprice.com entitled ""Is This the End of Diesel Trucks?"" Overpriced oil is certainly going to speed up the end of diesel trucks. That will be an enormous windfall for the airline industry -- which I don't think will go electric for at least a decade, and probably much longer. Sadly, 3 years or so is not an inevitable horizon for most individuals."

"If you're trying to decide whether airlines are investable -- instead of emotionally tradeable -- I think today is a fortunate lull. Jamie Baker's comments suppressed what almost certainly would have been the emotional knee-jerk rally that would otherwise have occurred. Likewise today's coronavirus news looks good, but not as shockingly good as yesterday. We do need that 48 hours I mentioned to make sure the virus has truly been beaten. Victory isn't going to be declared this week -- although I do think it may be declared next week. I also think domestic travel will start recovering by mid-May, and it won't be ""weird"" to be flying in June. International travel, especially transatlantic travel, still has an unknowable timeline. Once we see some of these things start happening, and learn much more about the grants and loans, we can start getting an idea of what the business is worth. Right now, nobody knows, even though I'm sure many posters will be certain they do. :)"
I hope it continues to rise. It’s all about covid and people’s perception about the vaccine.

"AAL will report Q4 2020 earnings BMO on Thursday, 1/28. As you all know the previous two quarterly earnings were also reported in the middle of the COV-19 pandemic. In fact, the Q2 was reported right after it was reported that we were having a second wave of the pandemic. Lately, it's been reported that there is a surge in new cases.If you were to take a random look at the previous two quarters, you shall notice that the daily volume increased twice as much on the day of earnings, 102% to be exact, in comparison to the days in the same week. It is probably a coincidence. The volume was also much higher in the previous week however they are not identical. The daily volume average during the trading week just ended on 1/22, is similar to October. It is 41.473M for October 12 thru 16 2020 vs 42.989M for January 19 thru 22 2021. If we'd knew the average volume (x) on Monday, 1/25 thru Wednesday 1/27, we'd have estimated the volume (102% of x) on 1/28. It's nothing by speculation. Another thing that I have observed was that the AAL's share price remained stable on the same week as the earnings were reported. This is based on the closing price. The range was mere 11 cents, and 24 cents in the week of earnings reported in July and October respectively. However, the price range was larger in the previous week for both quarters. Here are some other information I gathered based on daily closing price for the time frame I used:Q2 reported in July 2020:July 13-17,2020 => mean: $12.20; median: $11.91; range: $1.87; price stability: volatileWeek's closing price: $11.91; Average daily volume of the week: 80.472MJuly 20-22,2020 => mean: $11.43; median: $11.47; range: $0.11; price stability: very stableClosing price BE: $11.36; Average daily volume: 57.098MOn Earnings day: Open: $11.27; High: $12.41; Low: $11.01; Close: $11.77; Volume: 115.575MA week later: Week's High: $12.41; Week's Low: $10.80; Friday's close price: $11.12; range: $0.65; price: relatively stable; Volume:55.277M.--------------------------Q3 reported in October 2020:Oct 12-16,2020 => mean: $12.44; median: $12.36; range: $0.70; price stability: relatively stableWeek's closing price: $12.46; Average daily volume of the week: 41.473MOct 19-21,2020 => mean: $12.70; median: $12.75; range: $0.24; price stability: very stableClosing price BE: $12.75; Average daily volume: 44.938MOn Earnings day: Open: $12.60; High: $13.29; Low: $12.42; Close: $13.15; Volume: 90.789MA week later: Week's High: $12.45; Week's Low: $10.63; Friday's close price: $11.28; range: $0.85; price: relatively stable; Volume:62.182M--------------------------------------------------Q4 to be reported on 1/28/2021:Jan 19-22,2021 => mean: $15.95; median: $15.90; range:$0.35; price stability: relatively stable.Jan 25-27,2021 => (you can find it out on 1/27)"
"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday to review a standalone bill for $25 billion in aid to airlines that Democrats tried to advance last week, her spokesman wrote on Twitter.""Speaker Pelosi & Secretary Mnuchin spoke by phone at 9:33 a.m. The Secretary inquired about a standalone airlines bill. The Speaker reminded him that Republicans blocked that bill on Friday & asked him to review the DeFazio bill so that they could have an informed conversation,"" spokesman Drew Hammill wrote.Last week, Representative Peter DeFazio, chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, failed to win approval of a standalone bipartisan measure for airlines under unanimous consent after some Republicans objected.The request by airlines for another $25 billion payroll support program to protect jobs for another six months enjoys wide bipartisan backing, but a standalone measure would need unanimous support. A recent Republican-led attempt to pass standalone legislation in the Senate also failed after opposition from three Republican senators, aides told Reuters.Pelosi's conversation with Mnuchin came as the Trump administration signaled possible piecemeal legislation for airlines a day after walking away from talks on another broad COVID-19 stimulus package.A key component of fresh airline relief is to keep workers on the job for another six months. A prior $25 billion airline payroll support program expired on Sept. 30.The travel industry has been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines began the furlough of 32,000 workers last week, and tens of thousands more at those airlines and others have agreed to voluntary leaves or reduced hours. Southwest Airlines (LUV) has warned it will have to carry out the first furlough in its history if workers do not agree to pay cuts in the absence of federal aid.U.S. airlines urged top lawmakers to advance a standalone bill in a letter on Wednesday, warning that many more job losses are expected across the industry in the weeks ahead if aid is not extended.""We are disappointed that negotiations between Congress and the Administration over additional COVID-19 relief were suddenly suspended yesterday,"" Airlines for America and a dozen unions wrote in a letter on Wednesday to House and Senate leaders.Airline shares jumped on Wednesday after sinking suddenly a day earlier on remarks by President Donald Trump that his administration would abandon talks with congressional Democrats over a major stimulus package until after the Nov. 3 election.

Why did they hide under the rocks when a stock marched from $30 to $50, they’ve never explained that to Uncle!"
"If you were running AAL and had to decide what to do with a billion dollars of cash, what would you do?You could buy back stock (retiring about 40M at $25 per share) and reduce the share count from 446M to 406M. This would reduce the share count by about 9% resulting in a 9.7% increase in earning per share. This would move the earnings per share up about 50 cents per share.You could retire $1B in debt reducing expenses about $50M annually (most of their debt is 5% or less) which would increase earnings about 11 cents per share (pre-tax, probably 9 cents per share after-tax).You could add to your cash position adding about $15M in interest income (adding about 3 cents per share pre-tax)It seems pretty clear that buying back shares at these prices is the way to go.Not_A_Short"

Of course, if you tested 3000 random Americans, you'd probably get some coronavirus, too. But there's no way they can just release these folks.

I estimate 1.4b in fuel savings next year at 1.90 cost. Assuming stated revenue initiatives of 1b and cost savings of 300m are offset by fare and demand pressures you still are looking at 3$ pretax eps. Big risk now is if economy slows too much revenues could be down more than expected

Biggest quest today is do we load heavy ahead of next weeks stimulus package? Do you think they pass relief bill or not. Big question
American is an excellent BUY right now and you will make a lot of money right now if you do invest in the very near future. No doubt about it. Easily up to $15 within the next month and higher. In one day we can see this move. We are at the bottom and will definitely move much higher from here going forward.

"So I'm trying to think of what's likely to happen on earnings day tomorrow. As long time AAL/LCC/AWA investors know, ANYTHING can happen to the stock on earnings day -- even when all the news out of the company was good. Now, of course, AAL actually sometimes reports disappointing (and sometimes surprising) news. This quarter, the possible bad news centers around their bad spring operation, largely due to the mechanics slowdown and partially due to absolutely terrible spring/early summer weather. That disruption has got to be costly. Add to it the MAX problems and, well, it's hard to get too excited about Q2. That said, the airline business is such a great business now in America that all these woes are subsumed in the enhanced profitability. Astonishingly, AAL -- despite all their woes and general bad luck -- is expected to grow their Q2 earnings by 10%. Personally, I think it's crazy good that a company can grow earnings when things go terribly wrong. How many companies in America do that?Which is why I'm (cautiously) hopeful for tomorrow. Bad stuff happened in Q2, but I don't see much bad stuff happening in Q3. The operation is OK now. The mechanics are working. I believe the conventional wisdom is WAY too pessimistic about AAL's management: the idea that these guys ( who revolutionized the USA airline industry) suddenly don't know what they're doing because Scott Kirby left is stupid. Long term, AAL is unlikely to materially (if at all) underperform its competitors. Even the Street estimate for Q3 shows earnings increasing by 30%. That seems like terrific performance for a stock that is so deeply unloved."
I saw one of the posters say that Warren Buffett owns American airlines in the billions he needs to step up and crush UBS he's losing a fortune as they drive the stock down on one sell recommendation from an analyst who is ticked off for a comment the CEO of American airlines made though somehow I can't imagine Warren Buffett reading the Yahoo post poured but if you're out there Warren step up to the plate

"From a science perspective (I know, way above the pay grade of the average Wall St trader), we have lots of interesting information coming out these days. We know a lot more about what the virus ""does"" than we used to -- and a lot of what we were pretty sure we knew has now been confirmed. First, we know that this is mostly a disease that kills old and sick people: the differentials are staggering. Massachusetts today released detailed information about their 2360 deaths. 1504 were 80 years or older. Another 523 were 70 or older. Only 24 people under 50 have died. And almost all these deaths are from people with serious pre-existing health conditions.I know it's difficult for people to behave rationally when it comes to an ""invisible virus,"" but it's beyond obvious that we have to shift our public health strategy. From the antibody tests, we already know there are millions of Americans who've had COVID-19 without exhibiting any illness. This means the death rate of this disease is a tiny fraction of one percent and, for otherwise healthy people under 50, a number approach zero.Under such circumstances, our current lockdown strategy is absurd. We need to devote our resources to protecting the vulnerable but otherwise get on with things. Many of our elites will abandon the lockdown kicking and screaming, but common sense will obviously prevail. You can advocate for an economic depression based on this scientific data. It's the definition of insanity.For airlines, I think this means we're going to see more business, probably meaningful business, by June. The days of the lockdown are numbered."

"News Alert: American Airlines says it will fill flights to capacity July 1BY UPI— 1:48 PM ET 06/26/2020American Airlines ( AAL ) said Friday it will start filling its flight to capacity starting July 1 but will allow passengers to move to open seats if they are available at no extra cost.Since the coronavirus pandemic, American had blocked off 50 percent of the middle seats in the main cabin. Other airlines, like Delta Air Lines ( DAL Loading...Loading...), Jet Blue and Southwest Airlines ( LUV Loading...Loading...), have been blocking all middle seats.""As more people continue to travel, customers may notice that flights are booked to capacity starting July 1,"" American said in a statement. ""American will continue to notify customers and allow them to move to more open flights when available, all without incurring any cost. This is in addition to the airline's current travel waivers.""If space is available once boarding is complete -- taking into consideration any aircraft weight or balance restrictions -- customers may move to another seat within their ticketed cabin subject to availability.Ross Feinstein, an American spokesman, said the airline has had its busiest days since April while it has added intensified cleaning and making face masks mandatory for passengers and crew.""We believe it is safe to go back to our normal capacity,'' Feinstein said.American follows United and Spirit airlines, which are already booking to capacity."

This could absolutely reignite that surge.Also, the airlines rallying on the week that they are set to post the worst Q of financial results the industry has EVER seen sounds to me like a great contrarian or opposite play.It seems like the slam dunk obvious move would be to short the airlines this week...

Uncle means Cautiously Optimistic View is the Right words since it's hard to predict how many people will resist taking the Vaccine as we're going to allow every American to take the shot.Currently 79.12% of Seniors have taken the Shot, Seniors have reached Herd Immunity, we don't seen many Seniors infected these days, the Vaccine is working... Adults >=18 are 47.01% vaccinated, actually some are 16-17s, Uncle has no figures for 16 and 17 population, PFE has requested emergency usage for 12-15, people in the 16 and 17 currently can take PFE vaccine. USA should mandate all students to take vaccine before they go back to school. God Bless America! We will recover and we're recovering!"

However, he will be cashing several millions worth of options soon and from his vantage point there are no problems!

Customer service and running a profitable operation should be focus of running an airline, not Wall Street."

"Remember the high volume trading for a few days in early June when the stock price rose from low $10s to $22.80? The daily volume was 400MM or higher. Later on we questioned how much the shorts were responsible for it. The short interest has increased roughly by 2% in the first half of the month of June. This was also my post back then when iahphx asked ""Any idea what the short interest is here now? It's obvious that shorting the stock now is untenable given the facts on the ground.""TimT12 days ago Replied to a reaction$AAL conversation""Those two or three consecutive days of high volume trading back in early June (roughly one billion shares were traded, more than twice the floating shares) may suggest that there may have been a large percentage of short coverage but that may not be the case. I checked a few websites, which I tend to look at occasionally for a long time. I can't say if they are reliable at all. It doesn't suggest a high short coverage occurred on those days. There wasn't any significant change in terms of percentage (total volume vs short volume). If that's true, that would be a surprise to me. Are the crowd funding platforms the culprit for the hike of share price, at least, partially?Which brings us to the other question I have raised in my post yesterday. If those high volume days which caused the share price hike due to short interest coverage, why did the shorts agree on that strategy at this specific time when financial numbers are not good for Q2? If they are not responsible and short interest hasn't changed more than 10%, then shorts are not in panic mood. Yesterday was probably an attempt to test the waters for them, and it worked. Today is up, again until 15 minutes ago, trend buying stopped and price is coming down again. This is why the longs need to be cautious. I still maintain my position regarding AAL. This stock is going to be volatile on some days but I won't attempt to buy when stock price is high. I will day trade, and use option trading for buying but whatever quantity I buy, I will dump a large percentage of it the moment I can earn some profit in order to improve my average percentage. That's what I have been doing since late February."""

"If you read my $AAL comment prior to Q1 report, I pointed out a few things: AAL would have better Q1 result than DAL and UAL. Following the report, AAL' share price rose 2.86% first, and then the event of dumping of shares begun. In such events, the share price would usually be pulled up (on average 8%) prior to dumping based on the trend in the past.However, as I mentioned prior to Q1, the buy side has shown weakness lately. Also, the short interest volume dropped a lot in 2021. So, the shorts could short the stock without much fear. After all, the short squeeze that took over the market in February is no longer of an issue lately either.(link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/community?p=AAL&messageId=05066367-fc6c-41c5-abea-ce576c21dc96&bcmt=1)What is waiting for $AAL longs is that, the share price may go a little further down but aggressive shorting is not out of question either so don't rush into buying AAL shares. I have a long position in AAL but holding half as much as my usual core position, which I mentioned here a couple of weeks ago.We should've a positive outlook about the next two quarters. The cash flow won't be an issue for AAL. However, I've seen some wrong steps taken by Palmer and his team in the last two years since I started trading AAL shares, which will be the major obstacle for the share price not to do well in the future.At this point, we may witness some volatility and speculative moves until things calm down, give or take two weeks (less in trading days). The shorts have the upper hand unless some new investors come in help the little longs out. IMHO, even if they do, the share price will go up temporarily and then it’ll come down as soon as new buyers complete their transactions. Again, I give myself the advice that there is no need to rush if I want to create or increase my long position.However, any positivity on macro economic numbers, particularly increase in travel spending and PAX, removal of travel restrictions, reduced COVID cases domestically and globally will have positive impact on share price. Paying attention to anything that has impact on the fundamentals is more important than the daily speculative moves regarding AAL’ share price(I said that the growth in PAX has shown signs of slowing down over a month ago. That's what we have been observing now. It's been approximately at 60% compare to 2019)."
Why do people think this will drop to 2008 levels? Why does anyone think stocks will ever reach 2008? Inflation considerd or no? Things have changed a lot.
I have to be honest if this price goes to 16 dollars I think Parker needs to seriously consider doing something on the buyback front. Even more if it falls below it. As long as the company survives no one even Bob himself will ever be able to argue against this purchase. I know I’ll be condemned for this but honestly 1 billion to buy a 1/6 of the shares? I mean cmon. The value argument indicates a mild to moderate risk of bankruptcy if the company feels confident this will soon blow over you have to do something even 250-500 million. I know this won’t happen but my god when we look back a year or two later we will say I wish he did something at these prices

"SHORTIES, read this:WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 16 Senate Republicans on Wednesday backed extending a $25 billion payroll assistance program for U.S. airlines who have warned they may be forced to cut tens of thousands of jobs after Sept. 30 without government action, according to a letter seen by Reuters.The letter, which was led by Senator Cory Gardner, was signed by Senators Marco Rubio, Roger Wicker, James Inhofe, James Risch, John Cornyn, Todd Young, Susan Collins, Martha McSally and others. It's the first public disclosure of significant support in the Senate for additional emergency funding for U.S. airlines. The senators said they backed a new six-month extension of the $25 billion payroll support program ""to avoid furloughs and further support those workers.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-16-republican-senators-back-182534784.html"
"I find oil prices to be strange because oil is still selling for what historically is a ""normal"" price. Adjusted for inflation, the average price of oil since 1980 is about $56/barrel. I don't think the current conditions are ""normal."" We've had a sea change in production thanks to USA shale and as, the EIA and private forecasters confirmed today, world demand is tepid. Making fundamentally-based oil predictions is beyond risky, but I think most folks would believe ""down"" is more likely than ""up."" Even a couple quarters of lower fuel prices -- as we're now already seeing -- would generate an enormous amount of free cash flow that Parker could (and likely would) use to buy back his crazy cheap stock. Does no one on Wall St. see this Captain Obvious situation?"

"With Parker's decision to not report traffic monthly, AAL pps will be decided by every other airlines report and will probably be more responsive to the downside, given AAL's high debt and its ability to reduce earnings and elevate costs.

"This should surprise no sentient human, but expect good TSA enplanement numbers tomorrow morning. AAL has already said they reached mid-March traffic numbers on Friday, and today and tomorrow look even better. I'm not yet confident enough to predict it, but if I had to commit, I would say we'll see 1 million enplanements in the first half of July, instead of in the second half as I initially hoped. After that, it's hard to guess the number because it will be largely dependent on open borders, which are hard to guess right now. AAL is materially outperforming its competitors in traffic right now, because management was smarter than the competition in dealing with this crisis and rebound, and are flying more seats than the competition."

DO NOT SELLGamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause NAKD. AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us,"

"This Market is very strange. The airlines were too strong yesterday and they're too weak today. I guess this overall Market selloff is due to ""growth concerns tied to China."" So if the whole Market is weak, it's a good time to sell airline stocks, too. Of course, this is The Problem with airline stocks: they sell off on airline-related fears, and then sell off even more on broad Market fears! Obviously, the overall Market has looked expensive, so it's hardly surprising to get a selloff. I will say that the airlines have a fantastic hedge when it comes to ""broad fears about the economy."" That's oil. But the trading algorithms don't seem to be programmed for it. It's fundamentally wrong, but so what? As I've said before, as long as Americans think it's safe to fly around the USA, and other Western countries, the USA airlines will be just fine here and don't deserve a China drop. It's only if the virus gets worse and everyone shelters in their home that airlines will have a short term problem. Right now, I'm pretty sure the China virus has increased profitability due to much lower fuel cost."

"This bailout has become very hard to analyze. It is not clear yet if they will get a bailout or they will fire those jobs. The deadline is tomorrow and still our CEO Doug stated he is willing to delay the furloughs if he believes congress is committed to help. This is my opinion on the subject. We are in politics here, this isn't only about helping the airlines. Republicans and democrats have agreed on several subjects but they aren't able to move forward because they want to approve everything in a single piece. Democrats started with 3.4 trillion and rep with 1 trillion. Now republicans increased to 1.4 trillion and democrats decreased to 2.4 trillion. They haven't reached the breakeven point to approve the whole stimulus. They are closer but they are taking too long. I truly think they are going to approve the bailout. My hope is that they won't take too much time because there is no point in approving anything after American furloughs 18000 jobs. I can't speculate when it is going to happen. Only way to make money here is investing now and guessing the bailout is coming on time. I am in 400 shares at 12.30$. Have an opinion on bailout? share it."

Any relief in oil prices will be very helpful to AAL. All other operating expenses are hard to control.This could help the pace of share buybacks.
"So it's not rocket science to guess that the ""best scenario"" for AAL investors is a ""decent"" stock market with falling oil prices. We call that ""divergence."" Financialized oil often hitches a ride with a booming stock market as investors start looking for risky assets to invest it. That, obviously, has been the core problem for AAL. As the Trump Economy has caused a roaring stock market, investors looking for more returns have said ""Hey, let's put our money in oil."" Trump's decision to sanction Iran and try to stop their oil exports was a perfect ""excuse"" for hedge funds to buy more oil futures.The problem for this speculation, of course, is that there's no oil shortage. And higher oil prices cause less demand and more supply. So the recent sell off in stocks has obviously caused the hedgies to close oil their oil contracts. And, if the stock market stabilizes, they now they have to think whether it's worth getting back in or stay away from that game. Hard to say -- which is why nobody can predict oil prices. Today we are getting divergence. If it continues, AAL is going to be in the $40s pretty soon. If we don't, it's anyone's guess."

"The only reason AAL has not already filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, is the prospect of government largess and the admirable tenacity of Doug Parker.Countries that have or are very close to eradicating Covid-19 are now working on plans for a “travel bubble” where travel between those countries will not be restricted.For relatively shorter trips, Covid-19 makes automobiles now much more attractive than air travel. People in cars don’t wear masks, sit near strangers or interact with others in airports.Without infusions of cash from the government, there is no possibility that any of the legacy airlines get to breakeven as long as Covid-19 is still a significant factor...""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4354359"
"Today's volume is incredible and ominous - 4 times the average. Did Mr. Warren B. decide to throw in the towel? Several years ago Mr. Parker looked like the savior but this year he is shooting holes in the ship and it is indeed sinking. As stated before, Parker should prepare to buy that bottle of wine he will owe Mr. Sam Buttrick, an airline analyst for UBS O'Connor hedge fund and longtime acquaintance of Parker's, when December 31, 2018 hits and AAL is not at $60. That said, we all hope Parker wins that bet but the odds are getting worse by the day."

"FWIW, if you look at the jet fuel spot prices on the Airlines for America website, you'll see that -- even with rising oil prices -- jet fuel prices didn't increase in the past 5 weeks or so. On Feb. 15, jet fuel was $2.02. For yesterday, it was $1.96. So, from a cost standpoint, AAL should be OK. The only real issue this quarter will be the MAX, and I don't think that's been a huge cost issue (but without the company saying so, there's no way to know for sure). On the other hand, my hunch is that business travel has been a bit stronger than anticipated, simply because business conditions seem a bit stronger (remember, there were some recession fears a couple months ago).We really need AAL to not ""disappoint"" this quarter to get this stock moving to a more rational valuation."

"The BOD and Parker continue to be disconnected from reality. It's coming up to 2 years and AAL continues its slide in valuation to one of its lowest since inception. It appears their master plan is to do nothing, wait for the stars to align. There is no good news from this company's management, no debt or cost reduction, their signature move is just to buy back enough shares to keep their EPS around $5-6 and to under-perform at literally everything else. The company now has a valuation less than the $12B Parker was allowed to flushed down the share buyback toilet. Under their guidance and wasted money, the company is now worth 1/2 what it was. It flies more people and makes significantly less profit doing it.It has become the worst valued airline, now worth 1/3 of DAL, 1/3 of LUV, 1/2 of UAL, and only 4x SAVE.How bad must AAL's management be when Wall Street rewards Wells Fargo stock better and they're caught stealing from their customers! Expecting only disappointment from this management at Q3, and the usual 10% drop in stock price."

"As I have said last week in my comment, I don’t mind buying $AAL calls unlike the other individual on this board, who has been “lifetime” long on airlines and also encourages people to go long while he is not willing to add more shares of AAL to his portfolio. Just like I reduced my AAL position by half recently because I thought it was the smart thing to do then, I can add more if I think I may be able to manage to come on top in the deal even though I thought of the stock price that it was not desirable enough. It says one thing and one thing only: I have enough conviction in the stock than that individual. Thus, I put my money where my mouth is.However, in reality, I really wanted to wait for the stock price to drop to low $22s before I could add any new shares to reestablish my core position earlier (btw, I saw the share price was in the low $23s but I didn’t realize AAL’s share price dropped to $22.63 today until now. Was it a block sale?). Anyhow, I did it because I bought back some of my bi-weekly CCs expire tomorrow for a couple of pennies and I wanted to place a new bull call spread in case there is temporarily a gradual price rise in the coming trading days, rather than letting my AAL shares sit on a shelf unprofitably. Again, purely guessing, I think AAL’ share price will get to low $22s probably before the earnings. For that reason, I got two call orders be executed first and I sold one of them at a 15% gain when the stock price moved higher before the close. If the stock price climbs up on Friday even it’s for a percent or so, it will give me the opportunity to write CCs, which is similar in quantity as the call I bought and kept today."

"I might have thought LUV's accident today could hurt that stock. Honestly, that airline feels less safe (but still plenty safe) than the Big 3. I guess Wall St. doesn't care. BTW, not sure if pax booking away from LUV would actually be good for the Big 3. LUV might start discounting!"
"This is based on a very limited research and I need more time to make better informed decision. It appears to me the growth in airline traveling has begun showing signs of slowing down greatly recently. I am not sure how much of it is contributed by the weather conditions. It doesn't look like there are cancelations or delaying in a significant level particularly for American Airlines. So trade cautiously! If the market sentiment and sector trend are positive, I don't mind having bullish outlook for a little longer. However, I will not add any longer to my AAL long position. Instead, I will start averaging down my cost per share first; then, I will only add a little at a time if intraday trading activities provide gains. I just think that the number of issues that impels me to be more cautious is slowly growing lately. I still think the momentum for $AAL is positive but if the growth in air-traveling stays stagnant, the likelihood of a retracement in AAL's share price becomes a possibility.Remember I said I was concerned on lowered VIX and peaked XAL and JETS last week. There is also the greatly reduced short interest level, 73.97M(-43.17%) in January. During the month of January, the stock price has gained 8.88% net or (31%, the month's high- the month's low). The lowest share price was $15.04 and the highest share price was $21.77. When I compare the share price gains to change in short interest, the outcome is just the opposite of the previous months, October through January. The lowered VIX is understandable. However, if meteorological factors cause disruptions in air-traveling in the coming days, I would say the stage is set for a retracement. This doesn't mean the stock price may not exceed $20 or even $22 in the coming days or weeks. As of Friday, the positive sentiment endured about $AAL. Generally, prior to a major shorting activities, the stock price moves up big like 8% or so in the early morning session, and then shorting starts immediately. If we are entering into that phase, it may last a month at the least, which may take the share price all the way under $15. If we first reach $20-22 range, a 40% drop becomes significant. Again, I will act cautiously this week in my daily trading activities. I don't want to create panic, or blur your thinking. I am just saying have a strategy and be ready if it happens."

At the same time, logic would suggest USA oil exports will increase, given that these are going to be cheap (by world standards) cargos. All this suggests to me that we'll see declining USA oil inventories, even though it has nothing to do with overall world supply/demand. What do you think?"

Dear ms mark my words 23$ by EOW
"Why Mr. Parker must go:1. Not seeing into a future of significant cost increases as they would affect AAL margins. Yes, as an experienced airlines CEO he knows a lot about costs and margins, but actions, or lack of, speak louder than words.2. Ever increasing debt without guidance on a strategy for reducing it while continuing his massive share buyback. AAL would have seen a nice bump if last year he announced debt reduction and stopped the share buyback.3. Although caused by illegal collusion, oil/fuel is rising rapidly and again and Mr. Parker merely laments that fares are too low given the increasing cost of jet fuel. 4. Wanting to establish trust with the unions. Trust and unions are oxymorons. I live in one of the NYS union capitals and as long as the unions get what they want (their wants never end), then they will be your friend and those types of friends in the world of business are killers.5. Not anticipating serious attacks from existing and about to launch discount carriers, UAL, LUV and others. The market is a cutthroat as ever and AAL sits with massive debt, high fuel costs and greedy unions. Parker would deny that he lost sight of the competition but he should have started by not pandering to the unions.6. Recent snafus with computer systems when that was one area AAL had a shot of being considered best in class.7. Maintaining a stingy $.40 dividend, but then again, their available revenues to pay a higher dividend are shrinking.8. Lastly, assuring investors that in the long run his actions will prove to be good for AAL. Mr. Parker, in the long run we all die and your subjective timeframe is not reassuring. By the way, you better start looking for that bottle of wine you bet earlier in the year - $60 is not in the cards."

"Naturally the retail investor is looking at a price of $30 which was before covid hit. Majority of analysts price AAL at below $12. Every piece of positive news will push the price towards that $30 until reality sets in. My guess is that over the next few weeks AAL will gradually climb towards $25 on vaccine news, distribution and stimulus. By Mid Jan reality will set it that it is still a long way. AAL will report bad results and unemployment will stay high. Holiday travel will be disappointing and maybe vaccination will be much slower as nobody wants to be the first. $25 end of 2021 is more realistic."
american airlines will be 40.00 before you know it get in now and hold on for the ride as the world starts to open air travel the stock will go to the moon the stock has been in upward motion for four weeks

Barclays should take up the bet with Sam Buttrich instead!"

"Why are the unemployment numbers for May looking decent? Because the federal government cooked the books by creating a monetary incentive for companies to bring back laid-off workers even when there is no business need for them to actually be working:The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a $669-billion business loan program established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to help certain businesses, self-employed workers, sole proprietors, certain nonprofit organizations, and tribal businesses continue paying their workers.The Paycheck Protection Program allows entities to apply for low-interest private loans to pay for their payroll and certain other costs. The amount of a PPP loan is approximately equal to 2.5 times the applicant's average monthly payroll costs. The loan proceeds may be used to cover payroll costs, rent, interest, and utilities. The loan may be partially or fully forgiven if the business keeps its employee counts and employee wages stable. The program is implemented by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Staying Short AAL at $19.58 and expecting a big sell-off later in the day."

"Saw the stimulus proposals includes ""The proposal would reinstate the federal unemployment insurance supplement at $300 per week. It would also direct funds to Covid-19 vaccine distribution, schools and the transportation sector, among other provisions.""Does it mean it will still fund the airline bailout or more on the vaccone distribution cost ?Either case, it will be good for AAL.Imagine MaX737 flying around the country dropping 400million vaccinations !Will hold till end of week or $20 dollars at least whichever comes 1st"

"That projected $1.3B gain this year to pre-tax earnings has now basically all been spent on Boeing MAX, government shutdown, higher fuel cost and that ""non-recurring"" (yet annual) ""merger integration"" charge ($300M). Parker's not going to elevate the pre-tax earnings for 2019, it's now looking to be as bad as 2018. Parker's 3-5-7 goal has become 1-2-3, and he just raised the debt again by $750M, most likely to buy back more shares as it's the only way he can keep the EPS from dropping.This strategy of taking a company out of bankruptcy, merging it with another and heavily borrowing to buyback shares has truly been (and continues to be) a horrible business strategy, certainly unloved by Wall Street with the stock price less that $5 away from its 5 year low.Parker and the BOD are failing to reward the shareholders, vote no."

"Taxes are back this year, they just don't talk it loudly.""Airlines operating in the U.S. are once again collecting the federal excise tax on freight shipments that were suspended for most of last year to help the industry survive the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.The $2.2 trillion economic stimulus package known as the CARES Act provided an aviation tax holiday from March 28 through the end of 2020. Airlines were not required to charge the 6.25% tax on goods shipped by air or the 7.25% tax on passenger tickets, as well as other passenger fees, as a way to help attract customers. During that period, the government also did not impose excise taxes on jet fuel."""

"Parker’s getting his $10 Million, Unions get fat annual raise, we get 1.5% RASM and $billions of retired shares purchased at much higher prices in the treasury vault. And a dividend less than a money market. Time to install adults in Fort Worth."
Logic would suggest that a bullish market where no one is excited about oil is the best market for AAL shareholders. :)
"(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines and Viking Cruises are among the worst performers in the high-yield market Friday as coronavirus fears continue to roil the travel industry.American Airlines debt is now trading near levels associated with distressed companies5% notes due June 2022 dropped 6.75 cents to 86 cents, yielding 12.4%, according to Trace bond trading data3.75% notes due 2025 sunk 4.125 cents to 79 cents to yield 9.1%The cost to protect American Airlines debt in the credit default swaps market for five years surged 490.1 basis points to more than 1,000 basis points Friday, according to ICE Data ServicesProtection trades at 17.54 points upfront, meaning it now costs $1.75 million upfront to insure $10 million of the securities"
Maybe the market is finally noticing oil is down $9 from highs?
"To me, these relief packages sound far too complicated. What's the point of sending every American with income $75k or less $1200, based on their 2018 return? There are so many dislocations in that strategy. First, what about people who had a great 2018 but a rough 2019 and 2020? What about people who only entered the workforce in 2019, but have significant obligations like rent or children?To me the simplest solution here is to expand unemployment insurance from the FEDERAL government as a backstop to state programs, at 100% of pay for 4-6 months. Then, extend low interest bridge loans to affected industries. If they want to lay off people they will be covered by the unemployment insurance, but the loans will have to be paid back.That way ALL the direct cash payments go to affected people, and corporates that draw on the credit aren't getting a free ride - it's still debt. Why can't it be as simple as that?"
"Interesting trade: Those Jan 22' options give some monster upside. Unfortunately with the recent volatility the implied volatility is up significantly but you get 20 calls for about 5 dollars. If this thing is 25 dollars in 2 years time you break even that means it's a 10 billion dollar company (assuming 400 million shares). If it's 30 you double your money, 40 you quadruple your money. Two years is a very long time to stay down at these levels. I think as long as AAL doesn't go belly up thats the opportunity here, ideally if we stabilize a bit the premium will drop off significantly. In comparison stock appreciation is much less but of course you have the safety net of whatever value the shares are. I can't imagine this thing being dragged that low for two years but crazy things happen."
"I closed my puts, bought back some of my covered calls when the stock price dropped to $19 and wrote the covered calls again now. I kept the strike price same $20.50 however the covered calls will expire next Friday. Excluding extraordinary events like in the last a few days, a retreat in the market, I will trade with the assumption that the stock price will move sideways until the end of the month at least. What this means is that, getting in and out of traders. Since the price support comes from market sentiment, price may touch $23-24 but also down to below $19 like today unless new buyers come into the play or the existent ones increase $AAL percentage in their portfolio. In other words, I will buy when it drops significant value and sell when it goes up a few percentages. I think $18 is the new low while $23 is the top. Remember what I kept saying in the past! ""There will always be a better entry point tomorrow than the present value of today."" That's what the $AAL trend suggests. -When the stock drops significantly , selling puts not far off ATM would be a good choice FOR ME. On the other hand, when the stock price climbs significantly, selling covered calls not too far off ATM is another good choice FOR ME."
have they announced offering fully vaccinated/non masked flights yet?
Sweet bankruptcy!
"Rally in this stock is fading as Brent rally fades, too. Explain that. It's just FUBAR. I'd really like to read a comprehensive analysis of ""who"" trades this stock and how it's traded. It's worse than senseless."

Based on digital metrics and numerous computer algorithms I’ve run extensively. The actual price of AAL stock should be $12.63 In today’s dollars with a 16% premium regarding the covid19 ready test kit availability.
"The Mexican government said its tariffs would apply to U.S. cranberries, apples, grapes, some pork products and cheeses, and various metal products. European Union officials did not provide a list of U.S. products they would hit with taxes, but they promised a decision would be swift. Canada has also vowed to retaliate for any new restrictions.The moves mark a rapid escalation in a trade war between the United States and some of its closest foreign allies, with major trading partners retaliating immediately to President Trump’s decision to levy new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union."
"Flying up! Shorties know it’s not a matter of if, but of when! So if we all buy and hold at once they lose big rather than slowly convincing investors to sell at a loss.Hold strong, don’t sell. If you hold, the quicker your profits will come."

Who here remembers the Ebola scare? It was so similar yet so different. One day you get a scary article about it and you drop 3-6% the next day there was an article about jet fuel prices falling and the stock would go up 3-5%. The times have changed. That hasn’t happened once here.What helped put Ebola to bed was the repeated executives of all airlines saying they aren’t seeing any impact of the disease and profits and demand remained strong. Now they can’t say that because of China and Hong Kong but in addition to that there’s only be a scant reference from one analyst on the cost savings and increased profits. I think the dead fish are afraid to act or even speak right now.

Extremely uneventful day.Cmon show me the money!!!
"I am just back to my work desk just a while ago. I had to go to my sister's house to have a brunch and play with their little cat for a bit. She and I bonded well after spending the entire last week while they were on vacation. It cost me quite a bit money. Before the market opened, even yesterday midnight, I wanted post a comment and say that watch out the stock price which may drop to $12.60s but pay attention to $12.53. If it dropped below it, you should probably sell some of your position. My interest was to buy many (10 to 20) weekly calls at strike price $12. That could have paid handsomely for a day transaction. I went over some statistical figures but I have fallen asleep and I couldn't finish it. Hopefully, I may get to share my findings with you here. Meanwhile, somethings we (the long position holders) need to pay attention is that the daily volume average, the short interest level, the resistance levels and the open options interests if you want to figure out when to get in and out of trades successfully. The short interest was reduced by 5% in the first half of the month of August. It appears that the short interest probably in decline slightly in the second part of the month thus far. If you see that the daily volume is up which means daily ratio is lower, and the price is somewhat stable(typical daily price fluctuations are unavoidable), you need to look into open options interest. If you see that is also low relative to other weeks, you may interpret it as the price hike is possible.unfortunately, I was able to close some calls I bought yesterday at $12 for $1.20 at $1.86 when I noticed the stock price suddenly rose to $13.84.The next week's open option interest is low but the following week is high and the week after that is still low. Because the short interest level is reduced by more than 5% minimum, the Shorts are concerned. They can only push the price down if the resistance is weak which is what I have observed just prior to the stock price started coming down from $15.10.Personally, I do not expect this stock to go below $12.60 in the coming days as long as some crazy things don't happen in the market.Good luck!"
95%+ of all vaccinations so far are not J&J. Sheeple will be sheeple.
Congrats to those who bought AAL when UAL dropped on earnings. Nice profit! Plus these prices are an easy 2 bagger in 12 months.
"It seems that few want to discuss actual fundamentals here, but there are definitely some interesting things going on at the moment that -- eventually -- will enable us to value AAL. First, it's obvious that America has arrested at least this wave of virus spread. It really only got out of hand in the NYC metro area and in a handful of other small pockets of the country. The virus is now retreating pretty much everywhere. Most of the country should be able to ""reopen"" by May 1, if not sooner.So this is very good. But it's not like ""the problem"" is over.The next thing we need to know are the terms of the Federal ""bailout."" There are some reports that the Feds want the major airlines to pay back more of the grants that perhaps was previously thought. We don't really know yet. This will probably be a significant source of speculation in the next few days.Once that is settled, what does the future of air travel look like? Again, we don't really know. As I predicted, there would be basically no pax in April, but that May would start seeing a return of some customers. That seems almost certain now. I expect the recovery curve to start slow in about 2 weeks and keep building, such that by June air travel won't seem ""exotic"" and that, by July, it won't be unusual at all.But then what? Survival and prosperity are two different things. And figuring out how this inefficient market will value airlines -- on current reality or hope -- seems even trickier. This makes 9/11, which was much easier to game, look like a piece of cake."
"Only King Fish knows Fish Story well. Yeah, he speculates too. Ha!""UAL’s CFO Andrew Levy resigned today (5/17/2018) and will be replaced by UAL’s Treasurer, Gerry Laderman. This isn’t shocking news for most people close to the story, as Levy came on board 11 days before UAL hired Scott Kirby, changing the circumstances for Levy. We don’t doubt Levy’s departure was voluntary. We presume it portends future, other, changes in the C-suite Levy sees that may marginalize him further. And not to be missed, UAL affirmed 2018 EPS guidance despite higher fuel. EPS guidance is new for airlines this year and it’s been bumpy, but UAL is putting on a clinic on how to do it""."
Re-hiring of Scott Kirby as CEO should be seriously considered by the Board. The almost instant increase of up to 50 % (7 billion) would justify an even outrageous compensation package. Look at the impact Chipotle (CMG) had immediately following the hiring of the CEO from Taco Bell.
Ended first quarter with $6.8 billion of available liquidity and expects to end second quarter with approximately $11 billion of liquidity. Current maturities of $3.4 billionVery little concern that could violate their current debt covenants for 6 months and that presumes things don't improve or the G-man don't offer anything else.

"AAL is going to make more money than AMZN this year (just has it has every year since the merger). This is remarkable given the market cap of AAL is about $23B and AMZN is $547B. It is hard to justify (at times) the way the markets appraise the value of companies. Earnings should matter, but in today's market it seems a company's story is more important than a company's ability to execute (turning sales into profits). Not_A_Short"

"I don't have any stock or short position in this. Can someone pls explain the logic behind a stock going up , that basically just declared their business bankrupt in the last week and is now getting a bailout with tax payer money to survive until September or maybe even not until September . isn't the balance sheet completely screwed? how long will it take to make a profit if the company obv wasn't making enough money to even keep the lights on for a few months ?And why if it's a known fact that Airlines have bought their own stocks back for years, cant they just sell their stock , like we ( out of work people ) have to do, to get over the next months with now income ?"

"Took very little tech stocks at their all-time highs off and prepare to buy some Airlines all the way down, if they dare to. There was NO surprise at all as Uncle has already said they would do their best to take Nasdaq to all-time high. Normally Uncle don't trim techs till early May."
"The option interest for both calls and puts was high in the recent weeks and I said it was because the institutional investors bought puts to protect against any downtrend. The open interest is very low for the next two weeks. So, are the institutional investors no longer worried about a possible downtrend in share price while the premiums are low? They must be thinking ""that's all right, no need to waste money on premiums, we can sell the stocks because AAL brought in 200% profit since it's 52 weeks low."" Could the interpretation of it be ""we can always dump the stock at 20-30,40% discount and still make plenty profit?"""
PooR LONGS
"Beating Earnings/losings don't matter these days, how they guide and how the Street reacts are more important on stock prices, ALK was the only one that Beat the Top and Bottom lines according to their guidance, Uncle has wondered why the Street was so nice to place estimates low into the earnings.AAL missed it's own guidance with (62.13%) lower revenue, Parker guided approximately 62% lower, Parker also guided NON-GAAP loss of $2.7-$2.8bn and AAL came in with ($2,743m) which is $57m less losing from midpoint of $2,750m. There were all guided well, after seeing DAL and UAL's results, but the entire market is down, that's only factor I guess."
"It almost feel like people are hoping we never go back to normal with flight, so that they can short airlines stock some more to earn money. Truth is people who already get the vaccine are not afraid to fly anymore, mask wearing is the minimal effort needed by everyone to buy us time for further vaccine roll out, airlines should roll out vaccine identification for international flight passenger, it’s a simple amd efficient way to resume international flight."
"TSA report - WoooooW!!!3/18/2021 1,407,233"
Market gets a mild cold..AAL crashes. Again & again.
"Stock is bouncing. I just read the 8K and see nothing really concerning. Perhaps the fuel cost of 2.08-2.13 combined with two straight days of an oil rally didn't help. Perhaps the market was hoping for RASM to offset that, and with new range inside the old range (and still leaving the 3% bottom on the table) this was disappointing. I'm really seeing no surprises so maybe the market had priced in a surprise of some kind. However, I think there are technical factors here. The stock was trading right at it's lower uptrend resistance, and probably ripe for a short opportunity. We've cross through that support and are in no-man's land for a while, need to find a level where buying is strong regardless of fear."
Guys... Don't you think ... No reason to rise ... Airlines announced an annual loss ... The number of travelers is decreasing ... The index is very high ... Don't get caught ... It is a way to attract small investors .... The big traders are only spectators now .

"From Bloomberg: “ Chart of the Day: Jet fuel prices are sinking to the bottom of the barrel. The prospect of the first decline in global passenger demand in more than a decade has squeezed margins for the fuel at Singapore refineries by 39% since Jan. 23, when markets first began taking notice of the virus. They lurched 6% lower Monday and another 7.3% Tuesday on signs the outbreak is going global. Over the longer term, experts at the U.S. EIA still expect demand to grow, especially in Asia.”"
I cant understand the price action on AAL. It should be trading higher but struggles even with oil trending lower.I have my stops today set at $35.
"Nobody knows what the impact on the Airlines will be for this year due to the virus. The current earnings estimates were given before the virus was a factor. Valuing AAL based on earnings for this year is not appropriate. However, looking longer term the original earnings estimates still have validity. Earnings per share of about $5 look very enticing given a share price of $18. 32. (This earnings yield is 27.3% - stunning for a large cap stock) Once this virus panic subsides and earning return to more normal levels, shareholders that buy at these levels will be richy rewarded.

"Every person I work with(625 in my office) went work from home March13... All canceled vacation plans to June. When his calms every single one of themwill be rebooking on the massively discounted flights they offer to kick start this thing. Airlines will come roaring with the nearly the same exuberance that post-WWII created. Watch and see... restaurants, vacations, cruises, movies, etc...other than the lower end working classwho couldn't earn(but will be getting a paycheck nonetheless), those who continued to work during this time will be flush from the cash saved by not eating out, no costs to commute, no entertainment costs(bar, movies, etc) .... ALL who have been cooped up in their house will be looking for a way to GET OUT. In another 30 days things are going to start kicking off... its precisely why this stock is rising."
Why this stock is more down compared to other airline stocks? May be AAL needs an analyst opinion hopefully bullish call!!
"Getting tired of the ""Buffett must be selling"" posts every time the stock is down. I thought it was just Greg but several people are making them.

I would be surprised if he isn't reconsidering his policy of not holding more than 10% of the shares, which by the way, was to avoid having to do extra paperwork with the SEC."

"FWIW, we're getting to the levels where I thought Buffett might (reluctantly) make a tender offer. What does he have to lose? His shares will skyrocket in all the airlines if he places a bid for one of them. And it will focus the market on the absurdity of the valuations."
"A bit of a weird dynamic with airline stocks here as companies have some incentive right now to downplay the recovery as they seek more government assistance. It would be good to get that out of the way. The ""facts on the ground"" won't change, however, as the virus doesn't care what the humans do. Florida and Texas are each shedding about 1000 hospitalizations a week -- down now almost 50% from last month's highs -- as the virus epidemic ends in America. Media silence (and political opposition) on this fact slows the recovery, but the huge progress with COVID will be evident to most Americans very shortly. And more will then travel.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-suspend-flights-15-120702707.html"
"Lot's of talk on the board about share repurchases. A company has liabilities it can choose to retire … debt and equity. AAL's debt is say between 4-6% (and AAL has chosen to retire some high interest debt besides annual principal payments). AAL's equity is selling at a P/E of 7 … the inverse of 7 is about 14% (what investors are demanding to invest). So, do you want to retire debt at 4-6% or equity at 14%? As long as you can do either and stay within the going concern parameters, the choice is easy."
Told ya.. overpriced.. reality is hitting in. This industry isn't going to recover anytime soon.
It is that time of the week again...I TOLD YOU SO! I hope you took the steps to avoid a downtrend.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/community?p=AAL&messageId=95df85b6-c037-4633-afec-5f086de13227&bcmt=1
We as a a huge group of investors need to push AAL over $100-dollars. Let's all do it together and win big!
this stock is priced like it had a plane crash every day for a month.

"Kerry Philipovitch Announces Retirement; American Airlines Realigns Operations and Commercial Leadership TeamsGlobeNewswire•October 10, 2019FORT WORTH, Texas, Oct. 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Airlines announced today that Kerry Philipovitch, Senior Vice President of Customer Experience, will retire from the airline at the end of 2019. Philipovitch’s retirement is part of a long-planned personal desire to move into a new phase of her life and the airline has been preparing for this day for some time.“Kerry is one of the very best leaders I have had the privilege of working with,” said American Airlines President Robert Isom. “She is a great advisor, consummate team player and champion of those we serve inside and outside the company. She led the industry’s largest reservations system cutover and has been at the helm of numerous efficiency projects critical to our integration. American is far better because of Kerry’s contributions, including her work to promote passengers’ rights, support our diversity and inclusion initiatives, and launch innovative customer service training for team members. We will miss her, but Kerry has more than earned the right to do what is best for her and her family. Thankfully she has trained a stellar group of leaders who will carry on her legacy to drive operational excellence with the utmost care for our team.”Philipovitch began her aviation career in 1996 as a pricing analyst at Northwest Airlines before joining US Airways and later American. She has held leadership roles in Revenue Management, Network and Schedule Planning, Airport Customer Service and Reservations. At American, Philipovitch has overseen all aspects of the customer experience, including Airport Operations, Customer Planning, Flight Service, Reservations, Premium Services, Service Recovery and Cargo. Philipovitch will remain with the airline through the end of the year to assist with the transition.Operations and Commercial RealignmentWith this announcement, American is realigning its Operations and Commercial teams around four key pillars of the business: Operations, Network Strategy, Revenue and Customer Experience. The following four leaders will assume responsibility for these teams and each individual will report to Isom:David Seymour, Senior Vice President of OperationsVasu Raja, Senior Vice President of Network StrategyDon Casey, Senior Vice President of RevenueKurt Stache, Senior Vice President of Customer Experience“This is an opportunity to sharpen our focus on the key parts of our airline: running a reliable operation, expanding the world’s best network, maximizing all aspects of revenue to ensure American thrives forever, and delivering a superior customer journey as we create a world-class customer experience,” continued Isom. “This restructure puts innovative and extremely capable leaders at the forefront of these initiatives.”OperationsDavid Seymour will expand his responsibilities and assume leadership for all of American’s operations, furthered by two key changes to his organization. Jim Butler has been named Senior Vice President of Airport Operations and Cargo. Butler previously led the airline’s International Airport Operations and Cargo teams and will now assume responsibility for the airline’s domestic airports.In addition, Devon May has been named to the new role of Senior Vice President of American Eagle and Operations Planning. May will have responsibility for American’s regional operation and will lead the airline’s operations planning teams.Both Butler and May will report to Seymour. Kevin Brickner, Senior Vice President of Technical Operations; Kimball Stone, Senior Vice President of Flight and Integrated Operations Center and Ron Thomas, Vice President of Safety, will continue reporting to Seymour. Together this group will move past American’s integration milestones and work to optimize the airline’s operational excellence.Network StrategyVasu Raja is being promoted to Senior Vice President of Network Strategy. In this role, he will retain his responsibilities for American’s global network and will assume oversight of alliances and partnerships. Joe Mohan, Vice President of Alliances and Partnerships, will now report to Raja. This team will focus on maximizing the efficiencies of American’s current network and partnership structure, while ensuring American continues to provide customers with the industry’s preeminent network.RevenueDon Casey will lead the team responsible for the airline’s revenue. Jim Fox, Vice President of Pricing & Yield Management, will continue reporting to Casey. Casey’s oversight will expand to include the sales and distributions teams, working closely with Alison Taylor, Senior Vice President of Global Sales & Distribution, who will now report to Casey. This new structure will facilitate improved long-term customer partnerships and agility in responding to the ever-changing market needs of American’s customers."
Debt matters!!!!!
"If I were Parker, I'd start talking to Kirby about a merger and leak it to the media. Let's see what the public thinks about that! FWIW, it would be a great strategic move here. What could Trump do? Deny it so they ""go broke""? Or give the companies more gov't cash. It would be a brilliant move."
"441K enplanements yesterday; pretty sure we're going to hit my 500K target in 2 weeks (we might hit it a week early). Mind you, this was a revised target of 500K by the end of the month. And this is with it being very difficult to get accurate COVID-19 data in the media, so I assume many Americans are still unduly scared.Still confident on a million enplanements by the end of July. A great recovery."
"Come on people. Let’s be realistic... AAP is not going to be the next GME. I hope you all realize that GME was getting pumped by THOUSANDS of Reddit folks with money. We will see an increase but please, let’s have a little common sense here and not mislead our fellow shareholders. If earning come out somewhat decent I’m expecting an entry into the $20 range, hopefully $30. This won’t go to $200+ lol."
"Today is, again, a poster child for why we need the market to not be terrible to make money here. Sadly, that's beyond prediction."
SPY bubble about to pop...
"Added 2,000 shares to bring my total to 6,500 at $13.25 average. Not worth waiting for anything lower IMO. Any stimulus or August schedule load info produces another short squeeze like last time. Currently up $33,200 on AAL. Loaded up on two other travel companies today with profits from CAR."

AAL is still underperforming compared to DAL and UAL.

"MESA Airlines is fully recovered and more from Pre-Pandemic...MESA partners with AAL and UAL, also DHL.AAL is going Nowhere Today, the downside risk is minimum."
"What made Kirby think UAL will beat its peers to turn cash flow positive? Nobody talked about it, No Dead Fish even noticed it.UAL posted 9.739m PAX for 3Q, that's 15.23% of the 63.937m reported by TSA.UAL only grabbed 7.95% total PAX in 2Q, compared to AAL's 15.43%.We don't know how many AAL is going to report, but we got something to think about.DAL has been refusing to report their Passenger numbers."
"Not that Wall Street ever pays much attention to AAL's actual business, but if you go to AAL's twitter feed, you'll see a post from the airline's VP of Network Planning teasing that a major announcement is coming soon. I have no idea what it is."
"Uncle closes all January 19 options bought. Just realized that Monday is a Holiday, Uncle will be leaving Tuesday Night for Asia to celebrate Grandma's 102 Birthday with family. Will be back by Mid Feb"
still no flights lmao
"This is the only business where analysts say that if your costs go up it's bad, and if your costs go down, that's bad, too! If fuel costs were stable -- fat chance of that with financialized oil -- an analyst would probably say that's bad, too!Meanwhile, as has happened continuously since the merger, the airline keeps making money. I'm pretty sure the airline will make more money when fuel costs go down than when they go up -- in this case, probably about $2 billion more -- but, hey, math is boring."
When will Parker resign ?
"Not exactly an oligarchy. After a year of oil creeping up and CEOs talking about fares increases, yet all they've managed to do is match an LCCs $5 baggage fee!"

"Every hour today seems to bring more virus news. As it affects AAL, the thing I most dislike today are the infection numbers coming out of Italy (566) , and the fact that travellers have clearly spread this virus from Italy to most other European countries. Like Germany has 50 infections today. With no sign that the spread is ""under control,"" I personally wouldn't not fly tonight on a discretionary trip from the USA to Europe tonight (this is not an entirely theoretical idea for me; I am scheduled to fly to Europe at the end of this month). Since I consider myself to be far more rational and less panicky than the average bear, I figure if I wouldn't go, most people aren't going to want to go for at least the next couple of weeks. That means AAL is going to need to ground a good percentage of its transatlantic flights for March. Mind you, this isn't really a profitable month to fly to Europe, so it's not the worst thing in the world. From a p&l standpoint, can anyone tell me AAL's non-furlough obligations to pay flight crews if they don't fly?"
buy and hold... another 2%+ expected.
"Barrons reports on a new way to value airlines that includes cyclicality, capacity increases, capital intensive nature, crazy fluctuating PRASMs, and heavy union influence. Hint: its not a pretty as we thought in 2015. Its unique--but more like an auto company."
It's nice that the Market saw this Captain Obvious moment. They've been pretty oblivious lately when it comes to airline stocks. :)
"As I've said a zillion times, NOBODY is able to predict the short term price of oil. There are no fundamentals that will lead you to a ""correct"" price. All you can do is make a guess based on history -- and try to apply what we think is ""reality"" to predict future prices.There's obviously no fundamental reason why oil should be skyrocketing here. The US shale guys seemed poised to pump virtually unlimited crude at $50. At $80, the amount that will come to market seems almost unimaginable. The Venezuela and Iran stories make nice headlines, but at the end of the day, the US is going to make up that difference, and EVERYBODY has massive incentive to produce at these prices. Meanwhile, demand destruction rolls on: Elon Musk and others will benefit greatly from this nonsense. And have you see the price of nat gas? Is there anyone in America still using oil heat? Given these realities, I can't believe OPEC wants to price themselves out of a long term business."
I hope AAL is taking advantage of this crazy unwarranted share price reduction and buying back a ton of shares.
"$BA $UAL $AAL $CCL has nothing to do with crypto, minimal impact on interest rate hike, wayyyyy undervalued right now, load it up and you will not be sorry."
"People don’t care as much about Covid-19 as they did before. Flights are gradually coming back more quickly than previously thought, with data to back it up. It’s safe to assume most airline stocks will increase in the mid term. It’s worth considering how newly acquired debt will contribute to individual company results but don’t overthink this. These are mostly money printing machines. $UAL $JBLU $AAL $SAVE $LUV $DAL"

Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital.""https://q10k.com/AAL#sF4ABC5CD83D2515D974414BD8725C392""Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels are expected to have a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, is expected to depress demand for air travel into the foreseeable future. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of this pandemic, we can provide no assurance as to when and at what pace demand for air travel will return to pre-pandemic levels, if at all. Accordingly, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “The outbreak and global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a severe decline in demand for air travel which has adversely impacted our and other airlines’ business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar public health threats that we may face in the future, could result in additional adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity” and “The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.”We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to modernizing our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of March 31, 2020, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2020-2024 would be approximately $8.4 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements, in particular given the severe decline in revenue we have experienced as a result of COVID-19. If needed to meet our liquidity needs, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, due to, among other factors: our substantial level of existing indebtedness, particularly following the additional liquidity transactions completed and contemplated in response to the impact of COVID-19; our non-investment grade credit rating; market conditions; the availability of assets to use as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, which has been reduced as a result of certain financing transactions we have undertaken since the beginning of 2020 and may be further reduced as we continue to seek significant additional liquidity; and the effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the global economy generally and the air transportation industry in particular.

"I’m going out on a limb here the risk/reward for anyone with a long term horizon here is massively in favor of those on the long side. Please people stop panicking the time to buy is right around now. I cringed when I saw the 18.00 put was at 4.20 that’s extreme. We are all of .38 cents off of 18 as the time of this writing so you’re paying effectively almost 30% of current value to be protected on any further downside move. The turn will soon turn. In a month or so Iran will be better, South Korea is progressing that way and Italy has trickled down too. The US remains strong, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan are hanging strong this will soon pass. I can’t believe I’m saying this but I think there is a decent chance uncles perception of buying on 3/5 might be perfect or close to it. It’s time to act. If you have a few hundred or a few thousand hanging around those 20.00 calls are very very tempting. The 24-26 range has very strong support built into this is a temporary break due to excessive fear. We have canceled around 50-60 flights a week. We run over 6800 flights PER DAY.

"Today's action in AAL strongly confirms my suspicion that there's a lot of know-nothing fast money in the stock. If Parker can produce decent forward guidance next week -- and God knows, he should be able to -- we could have a very interesting set-up."
Almost 6MM shares were traded in the first half an hour. It's 3:30pm and more than 29.3MM shares were traded so far which is about the same volume as in the first two hours on other days. We need to see some price hike hopefully in the early days of next week. It would have been better if the price stayed above $13. What a shame!
"the problem with american airlines. have to go way back to 9-11. they were the biggest and strongest route wise except asia. ceo arpy did not want to file bankruptcy while every airline did. AA was the last to file even though arpy said he would resign if they did. he did and horton took over. meanwhile united paired up with continental and delta paired up with northwest. nobody wanted u.s airways. finally when parker who was with ultra low cost america west and took over u.s airways got the unions to agree with a merger becouse no unions wanted hortons scorched earth polices in a stand alone company. what AA ended up with was the worst route network of the big 3 airlines. since there network is inferior to United and delta parker did what the only thing he knew how to do, turn it into a low cost airline. cram more basic economy seats into the airplanes and keep labor cost below united and delta. no labor groups are getting contracts. parker is good at mergers but terrible at actually running an airline. losing latam...crew scheduling...work rules that keep workers happy? draconian sick call policies. bottom line is revenue will never grow workers will be forever unhappy and the debt will be sky high. parker is only concerned about how much shares he can accumulate before he retires and hands the reigns over to isom."
"Recent positive events with Parker and other insiders buying, as well as oil weakness and Qantas joint venture have blown up the Morgan Stanley thesis for a $26 target. Mechanics union is still an issue, but Parker must know something when he bought 50,000 shares yesterday. The other good thing is airlines shareholders don't have to worry too much about tariff trade issues, which can also help investors to hold onto AAL shares. I't been a long way down from the 2018 high of near $60 per share."

Huge swing on Uncle’s Tuesday in America!
Just a reminder that all AAL planes are to be returned to service by the end of April. A travel boom is in the near future. Don’t be on the sidelines watching the share price recovery.
"AAL is currently struggling to hold $5 above it's multi-year low in a time of great economy. It has spent huge sums of borrowed money to buy planes and company shares, all at an annual cost of 4-5%. These new planes have added no perceived benefit; there should be a 15% benefit from their fuel efficiencies alone. Also the stock buybacks were all spent in the $40s! So the 2 biggest decisions of the BOD and Parker have added negative benefit and have cost the company the largest debt in the industry for years to come. With AAL heading into its 3rd year of declining margins and share price, there's little plan in place that will elevate profits other than waiting for the Maxs to come back into service and increasing opportunities at DFW. With the looming costs of a mechanics contract and a new pilots contract how's that all going to get funded and also raise the profits and the margin? As Parker and BOD have said little to address the looming costs and the drop in margins, there is no long-term reason to invest in AAL as a growth stock, and no reason for fixed income investment with its 1% dividend the same that banks offer.AAL needs new management and a new BOD."
Ouch. Down $1.55 a share. Seeing my money drop so fast is difficult. I know I am far from alone in this but does not make me feel better. I don't see an end to this. But I am hanging in there.
"If Parker doesn't do somethign to support the stock price, like double the dividend, I will pretty much have had it. Not that I could sell at this price, of course. I'll just whine a lot. AAL can definitely afford a $0.20 dividend at current share count."

"I think it was a mistake for the company to sell shares this week. I've spent countless hours studying the data, and I am at least 90% sure that Nobel laureate and Stanford professor Michael Levitt is right about the virus. He says it burns out when 15 to 20% of the population have it. We've reached that percentage in the North -- hospitalizations in the North are dramatically decreasing every day -- and we should reach that in the Sunbelt in about 2 weeks. I believe the current Sunbelt mini-panic is depressing the speed of travel recovery by 15 to 20% as well. The Sunbelt ""spike"" will end in about 2 weeks. If AAL had waited 2 or 3 weeks to sell shares, it could have gotten $4 or $5 more for each share. At least that's my theory."
"Raymond James downgraded AAL from market Perform to UnderPerform, DAL from Outperform to Market Perform, LUV from Strong Buy to Outperform, BUT Upgraded UAL from Market Perform to Outperform.In the meanwhile, JBLU sees Q4 revenue down approx 70% y/y vs previous 65%."

"So I'm literally back from the wilderness today. So what did I miss? :)Honestly, not much is actually surprising me here. I've expected mass panic in the USA, which I still believe will continue through March; by April, things should look a lot better. I see there is now more scientific support for my Captain Obvious belief that coronavirus doesn't do so well with warmer weather. And, probably more significantly, I'm pretty certain that the mass panic that it shutting down life in America will materially help curb infections. I'm not sure whether the massive economic pain is actually worth it from this strategy, but it is what it is.I've been trying today to figure out tonight what the terms of the ""airline bailout"" will actually be, but I've not yet had success with this. The problem the airlines will have here is that revenue has turned negative: there are more refunds than bookings! It's a crazy unprecedented situation, for which I know of no way to model. By next week, airline traffic in America will almost certainly fall to almost nothing, as everyone is either afraid to fly or has no reason to fly (the country is basically shutting down). So how much cash do airlines like AAL need to survive this unprecedented dip? I have no idea. I do know that Doug Parker survived 9/11 at America West with almost no cash on hand, so I'm assuming the airline trade group modeled a ""worst case scenario"" for how much cash would be needed this time. And it seems like the Feds are going to give them this cash, at least in the form of loans. So it's probably a good bet that the Big Four won't go broke here. But until we get more information from the companies themselves, it's very hard to know this."

How are the $1.5 Billion of new owners feel in’? Like they’re losing altitude reaching for oxygen
Airlines won't be affected by anything powell says
"Good point from another board: Saying/writing Chiner Virus or Woohan Floo will cost you social credit points, but perfectly good to use UK, Brazilian, or South African virant Beeden regency need to remove the testing sword of damocles in order for airlines to move higher"
"Yesterday's PAX was at 90.48% of Last Year, we'll get over 100% forward, we've started comparing with 2019 level on the recovery path.That said, the total PAX for the quarter is still at 42.26% or down 57.74%, 7-day running average of PAX was 1,157,842, the trend continues to go Up and Up!"
"if management team is able to raise dividend slightly while keep share float constant not further shrinking its outstanding pool, I think AAL will be in mid $30"
I'm a little cynical! Let the hedge fund algorithms push this up one more time?
"So.. new to trading. Opened my Charles Schwab account a few months ago to get into the pandemic buy/sell off. I hold AAL, MRO, DAL, and UWT which is now extinct and sux since I put in 1k and it came back as 15.00 but AAL is holding at 13.25 after market. It represents 30% of what I have. Should I take a small profit of 100$ or so and get out in premarket before the earnings are out and get back in at 9 or 10 or do you think it will continue to go to 15 or so which as been it's recent high? Or another option is to hold until it's back to 30 or so and everyone will make money. Just looking for thoughts. no judgement as I literally just downloaded the streetsmart edge Charles schwab app today and literally feel like I'm looking at hieroglyphs. Please advice."
"reading all the PR and articles, it sounds like AA obituary has already been written. I agree on the financials it's dismissal, however AAL had always been very innovative and with some cuts and some wiser spending I believe the company can be set on a strong forward trajectory.As far as the stock price goes, it's been beaten down so much that it won't take much for it to atleast hit $20-25 by the end of Q1.IMO"
Yesterday's PAX was the highest since 3/30/2020.

What’s really making Airlines drop today?1. absolutely nothing 2. Profit taken 3. Oil4. Or just a good old fashion correction that will keep going into next week?Seen it once seen it a thousand times.
I told you days ago this would plummet
"I always said if AAL ever got to the all-time closing High back in March of 2013 I would sell. It's been a long time coming since my average share price of a $1.30. The stock has paid off my mortgage on a house and vacation home, and given a nice size will bumped my retirement. Thank you AAL. Time to regroup and rebalance! Uncle, your post have been invaluable!"
Anyone buying because of this drop?
short squeezed?
Buffett lost touch. His new motto is Buy low and sell lower. He is beginning to look like typical day trader.
"Back in February, I gave $24 price for AAL until Q1 earnings. I keep it as it is. Estimate the best daily and weekly price for the share and get in and out of position until then. It reached $26 and hardly anyone sold it. No one needs to tell you that you should roll the greenback. Stop making pickles out of it. Dollar index is down, find some undervalued commodity stocks. FCX was one of them when I mentioned it here a few weeks. Under $30 was a nice entry point and stock exceeded 20% return since."
Buffet bought 1MM DAL on Thurs
"Low oil, low interest.....corona virus is real, sad, but way over hyped! Donald will continue to be President for another 4 years! Trump 2020!I’m buying more on the next drop, maybe tomorrow! This was a gift!"
"Anyone placing any bets today? Talk about risk -- literally anything could happen this afternoon. That said, I'd bet that if you made this bet 10 times, you'd be a winner at least 7 out of 10. Oil looks to me like it wants to fall and, seasonally, we're about at the peak. The suddenly strong dollar seems to be pushing oil lower, too. But this is a wild crazy casino bet at this point. Over time, of course, AAL is going to be worth more than $42."
Holding until 30$+
get on board now...
"Trying to make oil predictions based on fundamentals is largely a fool's errand, but I think this analysis is fundamentally correct. At $50, Brent is still on the expensive side given the fundamentals. You just shouldn't have expensive crude given the Shale Revolution: there's just too much extra supply from the USA (and no reason why these techniques won't get exported). Sadly, this analysis is probably uninvestible, given the near complete financialization of that market. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/views/crude-oil-on-a-slippery-slope-may-find-support-at-50/barrel-level/articleshow/69652545.cms"
"Look at UAL … Maybe the market sees UAL's ability to reach DAL's margins easier now that DAL is cutting its profitability.When DAL speaks it usually does so in a way that maintains its halo effect … but then reality sets in. At least AAL since January, more so in March/April, has accepted reality and has been calling for fare hikes. And AAL cut eps right off the bat, unlike DAL. Isn't helping AAL though."
"Why not talk about costs that are going to go down, if not oil. Who can shed light on the $1 billion in savings AAL feels it can save over the next three years ... $250 million this year.I mentioned this before but nobody commented. About a year ago, AAL said they are carrying extra people from the merger, and would deal with that (if push didn't come to shove) with attrition, and at the time they didn't want to quantify the savings, I imagine since they were going to deal with it through attrition. I don't know if that is separate from the $1 billion above. DAL has about 90,000, and what does AAL have 126,000? Due to corporate structure, I don't know if the figures are comparable, but either way moving the work force down toward DAL would seem to provide quite a cost savings going into the future."
AA carries $30 plus billion in debt... more than the combined amount of Delta & United.Parker running the company into the ground
bought 150 june call options plus 7000 shares
"So even though we're talking billions in extra profits, there are no Wall St analysts (that I know of) that are trying to accurately guess the windfall in profitability from dramatically lower jet fuel costs. We'll obviously learn more about this in January on the earnings calls, but the math isn't hard. What I'm kind of wondering is that when the windfall is announced, will stocks like AAL rise because their p/e's are absurd, or will the Street say these gains are temporary and priced in? Basically, do airline stocks fall on higher oil prices but not rise on lower oil prices? That, of course, is the only way we get to the current low single digit p/e here.https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/Cheaper-jet-fuel-likely-to-give-airlines-Q4-boost"

Some of y’all forget that in order to make $$$ you have to sell at some point. Watch those profits shrink by the day. A company doesn’t go from burning billions & no business to worth more than it was before the pandemic overnight
most of investors lost huge money in nasdaq market will strong hurt airlines
"AAL continues its daily drop in value and appears to be heading to a new 52 year low. It is now worth less than 4x Spirit Airlines with its debt at almost double its value. It earns only double its debt payment, and continues to reissue new debt whenever they expire. Management recently told prospective investors that its debt isn't really a problem because they have $7B cash. Some on this board say that AAL can get a better return for investors by not paying down the debt. Currently the colatteral damage for not paying down the debt since Parker's spoke at the investor conference is a drop of 15% in the stock price value."
I think aal was a good buy today
today they dilute the paper :(
"a quick look at the fundamentals suggests the current stock price is at par with the book value of the company.$60B in assests / $60B in liabilities. If Stock equity is included, market cap is slightly high.Any feedback would be appreciated."
https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughputThere's a 22% increase in travellers over last Monday and this Monday. Good sign in right direction. Hope it keeps growing.
Does anyone know what time on Monday they will be releasing the TSA enplanements? Is it before the market open? And are the TSA enplanements data a weekly or monthly thing? Thanks
"TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL COME IN SECOND ROUND TO RESCUE AIRLINES INDUSTRY. WHEN THE NEWS ANNOUNCES WE WILL SEE INSTANTLY NICE HUGE JUMP FOR AAL. No DOUBT, ITS OVERSOLD CONDITION HERE. At THIS LOW PRICE YOU WILL BE REWARDED NICELY!"
"Correct me if I am wrong, but isn’t it rare for the price to go up after earnings call for AAL. Parker must have learned his lesson and not scared the analysts. I will have to read transcript. Also with the newest fleet don’t they have an advantage on fuel efficiency with the newer jets?"
"BTW that $2.9 billion is NOT a ""grant"" it's part 2 of the CARES money and we already know that flows right through to fund AAL's payroll. Grants don't need to be repaid, CARES funds do have to be paid back and with hefty interest. Have you bothered to calculate how much it is? I've read through their 10K but I'm not going to waste my researching some more just so I can waste time debating an idiot.Right there I see you've omitted (at least) two very significant expenditures. 1) Employee pension funding, this is a large number. As it stands they've kicked the can down the road to 2021 but it still needs to be funded. Airlines are notorious for underfunding their pensions.2) AAL is the largest Airline in America, they have a lot of planes. Whether they're in service or even if they're mothballed. Their planes need to be depreciated. This is a non-cash expense but their place still need do be written down over time. This is a huge number which you conveniently omitted.Their plane depreciation expense is a fixed cost and should be a huge number, more than sufficient to throw your rosy assumptions deep into the red. Break even my foot, you inadvertently omit operating costs just so you can reach break even. This is known as ""massaging"" the numbers. I've seen countless unscrupulous companies massage their numbers over countless years. Braniff Interational did just that, they massaged their numbers right into bankruptcy."
I am still not convinced. Recovery is good and I would love to catch the train but This soon? I don't think so. m just Gona sit back and watch.
Aal is being held back again why other airlines are flying high
"AAL was doing great for me on those upward climbs last month, but now we are hurting. Looks like more holding for now."
"Let's see how long all the Dead Fish and talking heads last trashing DAL and praising UAL.For 1Q19 Guidance at Midpoint fromDAL Pre-Tax Margin 7.5%, Capacity 4.0%, RASM-ex 1%, CASM -ex 1.5%, Fuel $2.00UAL Pre-Tax Margin 3.5%, Capacity 5.5%, RASM 0.65%, CASM-ex Flat, Fuel $2.02UAL guided PRASM +1.5% with given Cargo & Other, yielding RASM +0.65%.UAL has been lagging DAL's Pre-tax margin by 3-4% for years."
Oil spikes to 4 YEAR HIGH. Yet AAL mysteriously ignoring this huge negative news. Must be rigged!!!
"Parker has managed AAL to a new 52 week low, and is responsible for making AAL the worst airline in America to invest in, LCCs included. With the highest debt, AAL continues to reward its long-term investors with negative growth and a tiny dividend, and no plan in place to reverse this value decay."
"Short-Squeeze Risk AALShort interest as a percentage of American’s free float is about 29%, according to data from S3 Partners. No other major U.S. airline has short interest of more than 5%.American is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Like its rivals, the airline has been contending with the unprecedented collapse of air travel because of the coronavirus pandemic.Following American’s advance, CFRA Research changed its recommendation on the shares to hold from strong sell and lifted its price target to $19 from $8.“We think the stock is a high risk for one of the recent retail-investor-driven short squeezes we’ve seen play out,” CFRA analyst Colin Scarola wrote in a client note.The firm also elevated Spirit Airlines Inc. from sell to hold for the same reason. Short interest is about 16% of Spirit’s free float, according to Vertical Research."
Especially with the world government’s vaccinations plans
"This remains an impossible game. Fundamentally, what we are seeing is a remarkable bounceback in business on a quickly fading virus. We also have an overpriced general Market with looming inflation. What will AAL trade at? I don't know."
Bankrupt by April 1st
"Excellent letter sent out tonight from AA to its frequent flyers. Most importantly, they're pitching the fact that the air you breathe on-board AAL aircraft is similar to what you'd get inside a hospital building. AAL should make a knowledgeable spokesperson available to do media requests to explain this. I think it would materially help reduce fear.________________""Also, most of our aircraft are equipped with High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters that provide a complete air change approximately 15 to 30 times per hour, or once every two to four minutes. A HEPA filter's complete air change is better than most other forms of transportation and office buildings’ and similar to the standard for hospitals."""

"What's surprised CEO Sean Donohue, DFW airport CEO?""I don't know if you chalk it up to social media or whatever, but people just want to explore,"" Donohue said. ""It seems like air travel is going to keep growing because people want to explore. You see something on your phone and you say to yourself, 'Well, that looks pretty cool, I'd like to go check it out.'""The biggest beneficiary... American Airlines (AAL)"
Are you ready for Monday?
UK is opening up https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/10/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson-outlines-plan-to-reopen-economy.html
"I think I may know why Parker and Kirby parted ways. Listen to their presentations today at the JP Morgan conference. Parker is focused long term: he even talked about building an airline for new hires who will be working for the next 40 years. He mentioned the new DFW campus will function for 60 years. He talked about why AAL refuses to now give monthly guidance.Then there's Kirby. He's focused on this quarter's margins. Long term for him is 2 years.We'll have to see who's right. Maybe both of them. I will say that AAL stock jumped today on UAL's announcement raising quarterly unit revenue guidance by one point. Of course, UAL's short term guidance has recently sunk the industry's stocks by 10 to 15%, too."
"AAL will come out of this and the stock will triple in price. They are making all the right moves to keep Trump happy and he will loan, bail or whatever you want to call it, keeping them headed to prosperity again."
"There are over 800 airlines. After COVID, this number will be cut dramatically and will leave the larger airlines doing all the business. American Airlines and Delta will make up a huge chunk of the airline industry, we should be seeing a huge increase around August..."
"Hold the BAG, sub $20 soon!"
Gentlemen’s mark my words by EOW AAL will be above 23$ load and hold
"Long, strong and rarely wrong. Sorry, not sorry, shorty."
"Jefferies raised target on AAL from $15 to $25, DAL $40 to $50, UAL from $55 to $60, LUV from $55 to $70."
"A market SO STRONG, it can even drag AAL HIGHER!!!"
"It's plainly (planely?) obvious that Team Apocalypse is losing its grip on America, as evidence mounts that the virus isn't that much more lethal than flu and that the shutdown of America is bad public health policy. The country is therefore certain to reopen in May, which some of the harder hit pockets (most notably NYC) waiting a few more weeks. I don't think there will be a lot of air travel in May, but we will see the first rise in pax traffic. By June, domestic air travel will not be unusual. July will be the first signs of a normal domestic industry, but traffic will stay be extremely depressed. Bottomline, I'm 90% sure the industry is going to ""make it"" without needing a lot more help."
Sell when you can because we still have covid! And you should travel.
"Expect a near term (likely this week) retest of $20, before the stock settles around $18. Buy under $18, sell over $20, and reduce between $18 and $20. You could also by $18 calls and sell the $20 calls."
AAL are pulling all the park planes back to service plus institute new planes was on ordered prior to pandemic.
Good long term but currently overpriced. $20 is good entry point. Then have a great Christmas 2021.
"United Airlines Holdings and Delta Air Lines and their respective credit-card partners, JPMorgan Chase and American Express, have talked about selling miles ahead of schedule and for less than money to raise cash to weather the coronavirus pandemic, a news story said. The discussions might not result in any deals, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter."
"Let's see how today is gonna play out!On 2 out of 7 Fridays, the share price closed higher than Thursday's closing, while it was just about NEUTRAL ONCE, and DOWN on 4 out of 7. However the neutral and positive results occurred in the later part of the period.Also, the AAL's share price closed higher on 3 out of 7 weeks based on Monday's opening and Friday's closing, while 4 out of 7 weeks, AAL's share price closed lower. However, in two of those ""down"" weeks, the price difference between Monday's opening and Friday's closing was insignificant. The noticeable changes week 1 through 7 were as follows:-4.5%, 6.3%, -1.19%, 10.6%, -0.3%, -0.3%, -6%.On week 8, this week, the share price opened at $19.84 and the share price is up 5.1% as of Thursday's closing."
"What will happen during the next recession, which could dwarf the 2008 recession? Sure, you can reduce capacity but there is still a huge debt load to service. Typically, in a recession highly leveraged companies end up in bankruptcy. Name one recession that didn’t claim an airline."
"Loaded up, people who sell at current price are very short sighted."
Back to 8.50
Airlines might be making a mistake. They are basing summer travel on their forward booking models.It should be safe to assume that they don't have a model for this. Once there is clarity bookings will bounce back. The wave just needs to pass through center of the country (New York)
Power to People!! @Robinhood uplift restrictions!!!!!
its tough to see this stock revert back to inexplicable down days. the multiple percentage pt drops that are opposite market and many times greater downward than rest of the airlines. makes no sense

"UAL reported Traffic without revising guidance.Capacity was Up 6% (5.95% exactly), at top range of 5-6%, Load Factor was Up little to 82.70%,It is so weird that they didn't talk about their fuel cost which is supposed to be much lower or PRASM which is supposed to show a 3-5% growth."
I’m no expert but if we look at past trends when the price drops to 25-26 it’s usually a goos buy in since it most of the time goes up. Any thoughts ?

"To put things in perspective, I don't understand why folks are ""down"" on AAL and Doug Parker. Except of course shareholders who are losing money because of the stock's poor performance the last few months. But there is nothing wrong with the company and, honestly, the future has never looked brighter for this industry (at least in the last 50 years -- I don't know how folks felt after the Wright Brothers). Parker has a proven track record of having his airlines make money -- even under circumstances where they shouldn't have made any money at all (I'm particularly thinking of some grim America West days). United is suddenly perceived as a wonderful stock simply because Scott Kirby is taking some strategies learned during his AW/US/AA days (aka ""his Parker years) and applying them to UA. When he announced the plan, everyone hated it. Parker and Isom are now deploying a similar playbook: cutting unprofitable flights (like China) and beefing up service in hubs with high margins. It will almost certainly work, and it seems to be better opportunities than AA's competitors currently have. It will tweak AAL's margins a bit. And when it does, Parker will again be perceived as a genius. But it's the same management strategy the whole time."

So funny to see AAL bag holders get hosed day after day after day.
"This story was buried in the media today, but the US and Dubai have signed a deal that requires Emirates to issue real annual financial statements. This is going to be some interesting reading. Looks like a pretty big win for the US airlines. Thanks Donald! That said, I've never thought they were losing that much business to the subsidized Middle East airlines. The geography is just wrong: Dubai isn't really on the way to many destinations from the USA, except India. Still, this is a solid win, and a good precedent.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/apnewsbreak-us-emirates-strike-deal-resolving-airline-spat/2018/05/11/b75cefa0-5544-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8b3fe1fbfe88"

Trump is trying to improve our ""whatever"" position we have on everything to ensure we have a level playing field or a slight advantage over others as it should be since we are still the greatest power economically and militarily.

"Hunter Keay's question had a bizarre, nonsensical premise."
The 9 dollar put for July 24 is at like 8 cents. 80 dollars buys you 1000.It means that for 80 dollars if it hits 8 dollars a share you can sell 1000 shares for 9000 instead of 8000. 80 dollars for a potential very high price.If it drops violently next week you may sell the put for a 100 or 200% even if it doesnt drop under 9 by July 24.If it opens green and the put becomes 7 or 6 cents it might be worth a try.
"In the after hour trading the stock price reached $13.30. It is nice to see rise in stock price finally. I did say last week that the stock price was supposed to rise due to resistance by the longs and shorts were having difficulty to push the price down for two weeks. Also, the short interest has been at its highest level. I think one of the main reasons why the stock price soared this week and not last week (I was assigned a few thousands of shares as a result) is that the open option interest for next week is low. When you consider all the factors I mentioned last week, and the low open options for the coming week, this was expected._________TimT9 days agoThe short interest level is about 30% of the tradable shares currently. IMHO, in normal circumstances, there's a little more room for the short interest level to go higher at the least. This suggests that downward momentum is going to be tough battle. If we do not receive any more negative news about the pandemic or stock market, we may witness a brief hike in share price whether it is a few dollars or not (high $13s or low $14s at best); but, the downward trend appears to be a problem for the shorts. This is because there is resistance from the buy side and the longs are not willing to let their shares go at low price either for the last two weeks...."
"AAL made imperial Fish nuts, they upgrades/downgrades more often lately, from $45 to $42, to $46, to $43, $42 still knowing nothing...They upgraded DAL from $53 to $58, and today they think it's $61.Nobody really knows what to say about AAL, except Uncle calling it ""Too Bad To be Worse"" Stock, with little to none FCF.The game will change, I tell ya, on that front. The Capex will come down a whole lot, the OCF will probably also increase relative to that of DAL and UAL when they used up their NOLs (and saw lower OCF and FCF) while increasing debts on their new Airplanes. You gotta know what you're waiting for..."

"I like “ The airline’s 8-k filed with the SEC last week says the U.S. Treasury has warrants, “to purchase approximately 13.7 million shares of common stock of the company at a price of $12.51 per share.” American has also obtained $3.2 billion in new credit. Yet American is planning to request an additional $4.75 billion loan from the Treasury, according to Parker, who didn’t say why the additional funds are needed.”"
Established a position today at 10.14/share. Hoping for a decent return on this!
Suez canal will most likely be cleared later today. Upbeat news about AAL’s flight numbers and future bookings. Should be an up day for the airlines. Banks may temper index rise due to dismal hedge fund news (couldn’t happen to more deserving entities).
shorts are in a TOTAL reactionary mode right now... You see buys jump up and shorts quickly jump in trying to drop a lid on it. This is a longer squeeze but I think the squeeze is coming as people aren't stopping the purchase. The WORLD is tired of the rip off artists making bank off fear and destruction of companies just because they can.
they will block access to this stock as soon as it goes too high...rigged market
I am curious of all the companies you could invest in why did you buy a company that has huge debt and no free cash flow? In an industry that has bankruptcy after bankruptcy? Why not pick a company that makes money and has huge return on invested capital? And if you had to pick an airline why not pick one that makes money like Southwest?
"CNBC ""American higher risk of restructuring"""
For the longs in $KNDI don't gose hope average down this will be $50 stock next month when they start selling look at #TSLA how it started as well a good play is #PRPO they will sell millions of the test kids in all events as well great entry will double next week #NOVN and #TNXP Good luck and stay positive #INTC is a great call option buy at this price as well as $AAL buying calls at 90% discount from last month people started to travel and the call option for jan 2021 is only .21 cents
"Parker has always been an easy touch for the unions.....they hold, he folds. Pilots and flight attendants will never leave AAL because of seniority....mechanics should be reminded that if they bring AAL down they lose their salary, pension and travel perks and can retrain as car mechanics!!!"
"At some point there has to be accountability. Right now we own airplanes, a whole batch of AAL stock certificates Parker overpaid for, and a MONTAIN of debt that dwarfs total EQUITY. We hear discussion about full planes, efficient planes, energy prices, etc...but THATS not the big picture issue here.The big picture is Parker's 3-5-7 plan that attracted Buffett has NOT panned out. He's failed. He can't touch his 2015 performance.As former Education Secretary Bill Bennett once asked ""Where's the Outrage?"""
We are six weeks into this mess and already many have written off the major airlines. I suggest everyone calm down and wait a few more months before concluding the airline business is permanently impaired I think we are reaching the point of maximum pessimism. The media can continue to harp on every death and highlight every “expert” predicting armageddon. People will tire of this and begins to live their lives again. Covid-19 is one of many dangers out there. Far more people will die of other things this year and next. Not_A_Short
time for newCEO
just started showing green at 14$ per share and it started dipping should I still hold will the stock get more positive ?
I’m expecting this to run higher next week as most Ronbinhooders are opening brokerage accounts elsewhere due to their buy restrictions. It takes roughly 3 days to open and clear funds. Let’s go!!!
It will be sweet if we can push for some short squeeze. No way this is in red today while all the airlines in green.

More progress has been made on teleconferencing within the last 6 months than the last 6 years. Business travel will never return to the way it was before COVID. Airline industry will suffer from over capacity for years to come
Covid Hospitalizations on a clear decreasing trend. Vaccine roll outs increasing. Airline Industry soon to enter it's greatest recovery. Time is now or it'll be too late.
I just bought R/T ticket from sun country to Vegas at half the price of AAL.
The performance of airline stocks is dismal during a recession. Why would anyone gamble at this stage?

"The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told governors last week to prepare for the “large-scale"" distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by Nov. 1, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by NBC News.In the Aug. 27 letter, Dr. Robert Redfield said the agency had contracted with a pharmaceutical company, McKesson, to potentially distribute hundreds of millions of vaccine doses to local health departments and medical facilities across the country in the fall.Redfield called the effort “massive” and asked governors for their help expediting applications for distribution facilities that will be set up and operated by McKesson."

"AAL just has a downgrade from Morgen offering 12-month price forecasts for American Airlines Group Inc have a median target of 10.25, with a high estimate of 18.00 and a low estimate of 1.00. The median estimate represents a -33.36% decrease from the last price of 15.38."

"I bet there will be a class action lawsuits against brokerage firms, SEC, and many hedge funds for what happened today."

"I wonder if this will affect the price of the stock. According to ‘View from the Wing’ magazine, American Airlines is “investigating” a pilot for his comments on social media and on a podcast about a “diversity curriculum” for his local Dallas-area school district. The pilot criticized the curriculum online, and the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition which supports it. They, in turn, went to American Airlines claiming their employee is “harassing” them and sought to cancel him. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker wears a Black Lives Matter wristband."
"if it drop more, will buy more on the next dip, and the next dip. at some point , economy will have to be better , this stock will have to bounce back, I realize it will take time, rather wait , than take a loss."
I might buy at 18
"Oil is still under $64, general market is up and only news is that they are buying some new aircraft. This must be profit taking from last week’s run."

I don’t understand why the entire market is up so much when earnings are going to be atrocious soon.
i was watching the top moving stocks board just now and this is on it seems like wrong direction tho you know the world is against you when amc is doing better
i dont understand why robinhood stops trading in a stock like aal its unreal....no real reason except they want to control it for some odd reason
2013 was the same price as now.........
"A very boring day for Uncle, one Yahoo Finance on one screen, one drama episode on the other, one show the running stock tickets flying across. Took tiny profits on a couple of tech stocks, don't even know why they deserve so huge rally.All number crunching on Delta stuff, so far couldn't figure out why the stock (price) has been so weak compared to its much weaker peers . They only need 3% capacity growth in June to make a big quarter, even without nice refinery recovery this quarter, it's a sure thing they'll do much better in 2H.What will AAL do tomorrow under ""Me Too"" situation, Uncle needs to see how the market reacted in the past."
"AAL price target for tomorrow is $12.50, for Thursday $14.35 - $14.55."
"We have a very unusual situation here. I think AAL stock is almost 100% untethered from REAL fundamentals here. Any outside observer who looked at these facts would think AAL would be rallying here.There was only one REAL problem with this company this year: higher oil prices have a very material SHORT TERM impact on company profits. There were and are no other MATERIAL problems with this company. If oil prices stabilize, AAL will eventually recoup the expense of higher fuel cost with higher ticket prices. If oil prices fall, AAL will receive a windfall like in 2014. One of these 2 scenarios seems EXTREMELY likely here. Anyone who knows anything about fundamentals should be buying like crazy here. But they generally won't because they see the market doesn't now care about those fundamentals. That is true, but I guarantee that someone WILL eventually care. Greed is a very important emotion. When it takes over, watch out, and everyone who is afraid now of losing more money will wish they bought here. This is the problem with this game, however. It is very hard to play an irrational game. I've seen this more than a dozen times in the last 17 years with this stock. It is the screwiest profession I spend way more time thinking about how irrational investors will be and not thinking too hard about how the company is actually doing. Very little actually changes with regard to the company; the trajectory is almost the same. Things have pretty much continued to improve here since 2001. But the stock does all sorts of crazy moves."
"So if you actually bother to read the fundamentals, you'll find out that the Saudis have increased oil production by about a million barrels a day in June. That's a crazy production increase. They will either break or tie their all time production record. The US is also pumping oil at a record-breaking pace, increasing production yoy by an astonishing 1.6 million barrels/day. In the ""real world"" there is no way such production numbers could result in a massive spike in oil prices. But, of course, we have a financialized oil market, where price is not set by real world supply and demand but by speculation from financial players. I've railed against this for a decade, but it seems like nobody else in the world really cares about this issue or understands it. The result, of course, is wild non-fundamental swings in oil prices. We now have Trump supposedly getting a promise from the Saudi crown prince to get even more oil produced. I'm a bit skeptical that this will trigger a ""real"" change in Saudi production -- they've already spiked it a million barrels -- but if you were a speculator, would you really bet on higher prices based on these actual facts? It would seem an insane bet. But, of course, there are people who will make it."
Almost looks like a short squeeze but not sure what the triggering factor is?
"Futures up big, all that means is airlines up 10-20%"
AAL will generate FCF of close to 50% of current market cap. what other major global company can claim that?

this will go GREEEN soon
Who said 20$ soon? Raise your !!!
AAL poised to take off !
I am thinking to buy more today

BCTX very cheap to get in now. Successfully offered shares for $4.25 and is shorted now
Love all the amateur shorts asking why is this going up. Lol. I told you we will have a rally this week.
"It's pretty ironic that it wasn't the debt and buyback strategy that got us- in the end all the airlines got demolished but the black swan. I suppose AAL dropped more because of the balance sheet, but I think it was worth the risk. My only regret throughout 6.5 years of trading this (from LCC), is not selling in the $17s when I called into Cramer and I ignored his correct advice, until I was able to research Italy and really understand what we were facing here, when I sold it $4 lower.So I ended up taking the single biggest loss of my life. At least I took the shares I had, and immediately redeployed it into the market between S&P 2300 and 2500. I've only made up half my loss, but relative to holding AAL I'm feeling good about my decisions since the sale.Despite truly believing and understanding the value of the company absent a black swan, I still learned a lot about the market trying to trade this. The biggest lesson? You can't forget that sometimes you need to think on the level of the market, not whatever level you happen to be on.As far as getting back into AAL, I'm staying away for now, partially due to emotional reasons, but also because I just don't see this business having good news for quite some time. Might be a mistake, this could be the bottom. But I'm invested elsewhere and I'll still stand to benefit from improvements in the virus news, if not in AAL specifically."
I haven't sold any of my AAL stock since 2014 but decided to take a little profit and buy a new motor home and take a trip to New Zealand for a month. I intend to hold the rest until it gets in the $60's or $70's or give it to the kids when I kick the bucket. I bought AAMRQ at $4.72 a share. AAL has been very very good to me.
"Days like today reinforce my belief that systemic factors these days generally argue against deviating from herd investment strategies. Basically, it's better to play the stocks that the herd wants to inflate, but try to trim back when the herd seems particularly greedy. Buying undervalued stocks makes logical sense, but doesn't actually work very well these days."
"Sadly, I am betting that Warren Buffet may once again express dismay with airlines and question his sanity in his reinvestment strategy several years ago. The sector is self destructive with competitors constantly undermining each other with a negative net gain after the dust settles. Example: airlines that never competed in the international market decide to begin looking at international routes; adding capacity to the point where even a very good passenger number leaves empty seats on many flights; cutting fares to the point it challenges margins needed to remain profitable. Oil is now at a sweet spot for airlines and their stocks are tumbling big time. Yes, Mr. Parker was not the wizard we initially thought he was and next week we may start seeing articles on AAL's high debt and labor costs further eroding margins. The analysts that saw target prices in the high 40s, 50s and even 60s should be forced to resign from calling the airline sectors."
AAL's earnings per share is more than half of UAL's earnings but the stock price per share is substantially less than half UAL's stock price.
"domestic bookings are looking great, now if we can get those international numbers up"
What happened to WB selling all his airline stocks. I guess he is like anyone else now selling stocks when everybody is fearful.
"Come guys!! Let's do it reach $30 , we can! :)"
OK..time to cover below $48 here @ $47.83..Good Trading. Remember this is not a long term investment because we there are too many issues for the industry and they all come up between now and in the next 2-3 yrs.
"You have to give credit to Mr. Parker for staying the course on the stock repurchases. Last year he thought it was a buy in the $40s, so it would make sense to be a buyer now that it is trading in the low-mid $30s. I know many here think the buyback is a mistake (mostly because it has not lifted the share price). But, if he thinks it is the best use of excess company cash, he should continue it. Not_A_Short"
added more shares to aal... hod your seatbelt we are going to moon.
"Parker needs to go! All he has done is take this from an $18B company to $13B company in a span of 5 years in the middle of one of the best economies the US has ever seen, managing to lose $5B while raking up debt. Time to make American Airlines Great Again and fire him along with some of the board memebers!"
"AAL raise to $18 if they have partner with JetBlue and without this deal AAL targets price is $13Good luck trader. I think $11.40 is lowest price for AAL so it is only going up t this priceTo this end, Linenberg reiterated a Buy recommendation on AAL along with an $18 price target. Expect upside of 57%, should the target be met over the next 12 months. (To watch Linenberg’s track record, click here)Linenberg’s colleagues aren’t quite as upbeat. Based on 3 Buys and Holds, each, and an additional 7 Sells, the airline has a Moderate Sell consensus rating. However, the share price has declined to such an extent that there’s possible upside of 17%, should the $13.44 average price target be met in the following months. (See American Airlines stock-price forecast on TipRanks)"
"Airlines didn't seem to get a dime from new $1.9T at all.Well, they don't ""need"" it anyway!"
Mark my words 23$ by EOW
"I bought 10,000 shares today going up"
"Given the weak way AAL has traded the past year, I wasn't surprised that it fell pretty hard on the Iranian oil news. The idea tha t this is somehow ""worse"" for AAL than UAL is entirely irrational but, hey, the market often IS irrational. My hunch this earnings season is that the market is unduly pessimistic about AAL's earnings potential -- which is basically the same as DAL and UAL's -- so we're more likely to get an emotional upside surprise than downward surprise. Unless, of course Parker is hiding some unexpected bad news, which is improbable but can't be completely ruled out. The Iranian oil news is probably a one day, or up to 3-day, story. There's a deal with the Saudis to pump more oil to make up for any Iranian shortfall (Trump said this in a tweet today, and the Saudis said the same thing, but obliquely), but of course the speculators don't want to hear that. They want to speculate. Another great development for the Permian folks which, in the long (and probably uninvestable) run, is actually good for the US airline industry."
It will reach $23 any moment... it cannot be resisted........

I just paid $118 for a main cabin extra seat on a red eye from DFW to SCL in July. So maybe that's why the stock is up today.
If you’re waiting on single digits it’s not going to happen. LF is in the 60’s next week. With reduced costs and burn they need approximately 45% to be cash positive. There will be 1M+ passengers by July 4th easily.

If these results hold for another day, and this situation looks OK in Europe and elsewhere, it will be time to buy AAL. So far Europe looks OK, but I'd like to see a material tick down in Italy infections. I wouldn't worry too much about what the broad market does. Honestly, I want it to stay down for the next day or two so I can hopefully buy AAL at this price with a fantastic risk/reward. Again, it's just odds. Keep your fingers crossed for the next 48 hours."

Parker has really prepared AAL for the mess they are about to enter. All time low on stock with approximately 330M less shares than the initial distribution and now saddled with $33B in debt...AAL ALWAYS declines more than any other airline and its pretty obvious why Wall Street has little to no respect for this CEO

"Continuing plunge in oil -- and jet fuel prices -- sets up an interesting dynamic for the USA airlines. If the Wuhan virus stays in China, the US airlines will reap a windfall profit in the first half of the year. It is spreads -- with corresponding fear -- they'll take a profit hit. Not really sure why either scenario should impact the stock price THAT much, given that it's all temporary, but traders gotta trade."
"If you got money to set aside and want to invest, airline and cruise line stocks are a great investment. These stocks should be back to pre pandemic levels in 2-3 years.

The stimulus bill has passed the Senate and will be signed next week. Air travel is increasing. Vaccinations are increasing. Sentiment about the economy is improving. Now is the time to force the short sellers to capitulate and send AAL way up in price in anticipation of a much improved summer/fall travel season. Longs should be giddy. Shorts should be shaking in their boots.

"I don't even want to think about what's coming at us, the AAL shareholders, today. It looks like by the time this crisis is over, China will be the biggest economy and the U.S. will drop to the second place. That will be the greatest victory the Socialist-Communist nation is going to achieve against the western powers. I was told we've had much more time for that even though the British Standard Chartered Bank claimed this event was going to take place in 2020 in its report last year. Regardless of the crises, China will still have positive economic growth in 2020 while the U.S. will declare recession with still three quarters to go."
Forget about the lowered cost estimate. Has anyone ever seen an airline stock fall almost 6% on a revised unit revenue cut of one-half of one percent? After the stock has already been decimated on pretty much nothing? It's very weird. You'd never guess that they're about to make $1.60 this quarter!
"With his rally AA is about 3 billion in market share below their pre covid numbers. Those 3 billion less in market are less than the amount of money they have loss already and a lot less than those losses plus the money they will keep losing throught the year.If you are not buying some puts right now, you dont deserve money lol"

gonna be a big news week for airlines
"Fly with confidence:In the same briefing, representatives of Airbus, Boeing and Embraer shared information on extensive research they have conducted independently to understand the effectiveness of onboard protections such as the cabin HEPA air filter system, top-to-bottom air flows, the natural barriers formed by seatbacks, and mask wearing. All have conducted 3D computational fluid dynamic models that have provided insight into what happens to cough droplets in a cabin. The downward flow of air that comes from the cabin ceiling and is completely refreshed every two to three minutes pushes larger droplets to the floor and washes them out. Smaller aerosol droplets, which can reach further, are also massively dissipated by the air system.Bruno Fargeon, leader of Airbus Engineering’s Airbus Keep Trust in Air Travel initiative, said models show a single cough by one passenger could create some 10,000 such droplets, but a maximum of just five droplets might reach a passenger seated next to the cougher. The same models also looked at what happens when a person coughs on the ground but is socially distanced by 1.8 m (6 ft.) from other people. Models found the likely maximum number of droplets that might reach a person 1.8 m away was 10.“So being on an aircraft is safer than being six feet away on the ground,” Powell said. The biggest difference is the effect cabin air and filters have on droplets.Dan Freeman, engineering director at Boeing’s Confident Travel Initiative, said the company had done “vast amounts of research” and modeling and live testing on narrowbodies and widebodies, taking worst-case scenarios with masked and unmasked passengers. Even in worst-case scenarios, the research indicates that being on an aircraft is equivalent to being 7 ft. or more away from other people in an indoor ground environment, he said. Boeing models were done based on full aircraft with every seat occupied.Luis Carlos Affonso, Embraer SVP engineering, technology and strategy, noted that their modeling based on seven rows of seating did show that mask-wearing further reduced the risk of droplets being dispersed, with the risk being six times higher if masks are not worn."

The US has increased it's oil production by Iran's TOTAL exports! So even if you thought the other world woes (like Venezuela) trumped other production increases (they don't, but assume for argument's sake) how do you get to a 40% increase? On a fundamental basis, I would think sellers would be happy to get the same price as last year given the massive USA shale revolution -- yet alone 40% more. There's something astonishingly wrong with that market, and nobody seems to wants to get to the bottom of it (which is almost certainly financialization)."
"Parker at McDonald's - Parker Super-Sized 2 Senior Security Notes and AAdvantage Term Loan to $10bn USD, at avg 5.575%.AAL Up 9 cents after News, the Street is totally amazed at what Parker could do in Good Time and in Bad Time. This beats the sht of Uncle!"
Market collapses--down 373 points. AAL down TRIPLE the market-- AGAIN.Goodbye Parker. ZERO severance. Nadda.BOD--do your JOB!!
They missed expected revenue by 0.4%.... dang....
AA Mechanics still no contract.Parker can’t lead his way out of a paper bag.Unhappy mechanics? Maybe you should fly another airline
"Secondary IPO probably will be $14.75/share tomorrow, +/- 25 cents.LUV's current price is already 21.23% higher than its 2ndary IPO price.UAL's is 39.02% higher than its 2ndary IPO price.All Airlines will issue 2ndary IPOs to secure their Liquidity, this is not ANY surprise to ANYbody who fully use Both Sides of Brains.Survive 1st, Fight back harder, boost the share price further later, IPO more at Higher Share Prices and Payback/reduce Debts. It's Uncle's formula!"
"I think there is a possibility that AAL can go down further but at this level, it is a good buy and as promised 2 days ago, I bought some this morning. If you buy into this stock, be prepared to ride this for 1 or 2 years. However, you can always cash out if it goes up too fast."
"On CNBC's ""Mad Money Lightning Round,"" Jim Cramer said Instead of American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL), Cramer would rather buy Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV), because it doesn't lose money and it has been a great long term stock."
AAl should see $20 this week.
"""Two reports into 1Q earnings and, so far, things are going well. For good reasons many were nervous about UAL’s call, but it was solid and measured. UAL mainly talked about itself and not others, which is what good companies do, and gave people no reasons to panic about the space. At some point longer-term investors (gasp) might even consider coming back! The truth is: industry RASM outlook is still pretty good despite elevated capacity growth (huge coincidence fuel is higher). If airlines can get through next week when domestic-oriented airlines give 2Q RASM guides it will feel even better. Regardless of your view on UAL’s chances of success with its turnaround plan, skeptics must consider conceding that UAL’s capacity growth might be absorbed without widespread pricing problems and that the underlying fundamentals of the industry are solid.""- King Fish Says and Uncle Agrees!"

"Do not be fooled by this sudden rise in price. The shorts are playing safe. Maybe they are picking up as many stocks as possible. My bet is that the big investors need to make money before the summer. So this market has to be pick up at some point. The fact is that this stock has not been in buyers radar. As long as the market is volatile, they'll sit at the corner and watch the carnage. They need to be assured that the future is bright."

"Going into Q1 and next year:1. Won't have the negative impact from last year related to the configuration problems. What was that cost?2. Won't have the impact of the illegal mechanic actions. What was that cost?3. There were fare hikes last year in Q1, June, and last fall of $5 OW, which the impact was probably delayed by at least a half of a quarter. All in effect for 2020 (seasonally adjusted)4. Operations are running better.5. Max reimbursement for the first half.6. Assuming the max gets back in the second half and is accepted by the public, AAL can ramp initiatives.Negatives1. There may be some drop off in traffic with the shorts that lost money not having the money to travel."
"Relief delayed doesn’t necessarily mean relief denied. The $3.5 and $2.4 trillion bills were over the top.Impressive to see that the President put America 1st and rejected the deals.The public doesn’t comprehend the difference between One and Three trillion and he could have just went for the glory of stimulus payments going out.My understanding is that Congress is out until the 19th, so nothing was going to happen until then anyway and the standalone bill cannot be ruled out. And while it would have been a very nice bonus for AAL and good to keep the staffs intact it wasn’t imperative for AAL.I don’t make price predictions, but note AAL was in the mid$11s before the PSP extension chatter began & when the big 4, CA, TX, FL, AZ were surging, and traffic stalled. Now traffic growth is back on, the big 4 cases are still on the decline and the $5.5 billion loan agreement was abrogated."
"It took exactly 3 month, from 11/12/2019 for AAL to close back over $30.AAL was closed $30.59 on 11/11/2019, it closed Today at $30.47.AAL traded 11 out of 12 sessions above $30 between 10/25/2019 and 11/11/2019, that was when it came out of months of trading under $30 between 8/1/2019 to 10/24/2019. AAL closed at $30.30 on 7/31/2019.In other words, AAL only traded above $30 since 8/1/2019 for 11 out of 12 sessions.AAL is a Love and Hate Story for the Longs and Shorts, but, we have the Valentine's Day coming this Friday, All Day!"
The recovery is evident based on the vaccination rolling out. Airlines will be flipping their wings with hugh upside than down side.
Saved the middle seat for you Dougie Parker. You'll LOVE it!
"Stock down 3% again, 2 days in a row, over double that of any other airline!Obviously the Investor conference hasn't gone well for AAL, taking the biggest drop in share price.This idea of Parkers to not report monthly traffic and his recent quoted desire to not even report quarterly is looking more foolish every day. It would be more tolerated if his long-term plan had something substantial (some of us are already into it for 5 years).Currently AAL has offered up (a maybe) $4B in 2-3 years with reduced CASM increases(1-2%). However I've heard this integration benefit speech a few times over these 5 years and Parker spends it away before it's in the pocket. Currently with $25B of debt, an annual debt payment of $1B, the BOD needs to take his name off the credit card. In fact can we get Kirby back? (UAL, please take Parker)"
"Got it. New deal of $15bn is supposed to mirror the 1st $25bn, Uncle guessed wrong, 15/25 is 3/5, and to be fully comparable, AAL should receive $4,218*3/5=$2,530.8m grant, and $1,765*3/5=$1,059m PSP Loan, and give Treasury $105.9m ""worth"" of Warrants at $12.51/share (or 8.46m shares).Now the question is whether it's worth for the airlines to take it by hiring laid-off employees back if there're not really needed. This is also something Parker can argue with the Treasury since it doesn't really make much sense."
"I’m glad I sold 5x the $35 calls as stock I just bought at $33.78 for Friday, lowered my cost $1 per shareSomeone thinks this $35 Friday we oct 12 $35 10,000 contracts vs 854 open"

"AAL will probably get $3,836m from the current government handout, consists of $2,661m of grants and $1,175m of PSP loan and gives warrants for the government to buy stocks at $12.51/share.LUV will get $1,500m grants and $650m PSP on same calculation..."
What do you guys predict for tomorrow’s opening price
Great to see the transportation sector making strides in these market conditions
"I had held AAL shares during the pandemic crisis from March to May and it was brutal. Sold AAL for a loss and moved on to stocks that made sense like PENN, SGMS, etc. and I did OK. I jumped in 2 weeks back @ $12.9 and AAL has shown some mercy on me and will hold. Once the vaccine is approved, AAL will make money and we can expect around $25 by spring 2021. Airlines and Energy stocks have been beaten up and holding them now will not disappoint. Weigh your thoughts."
"There's Nothing you can do about Other People giving Up their Shares, it is 100% None of Your Business!But, there is Something you Must know which may help reduce you anxiety.The New Airlines CARES package is identical as the 1st one, at around 60% in amount, meaning 60% of Grants and 60% of PSP Loans and 10% worth of PSP Warrant will have much higher Striking Prices.For example, AAL's 1st PSP came with disgusting $12.51 striking price, requiring AAL to Give the government more Shares, the PSP 2's striking price will be somewhere around $15.66/share, assuming they use the 12/24's closing price.DAL's 1st PSP striking price was #24.39, the 2nd one will be $39.73, one can use any day's closing price around 12/24. DAL said hey got $39 and something!"
"What will prevent AAL and the rest from bankruptcy? I mean, who wants to fly on a crowded plan? I own a few hundred shares and will just hold, but I don't see a return to massive flying anytime soon? Won't behavior change?"
"Lots of cancellations today. But not due to mechanics. As you've probably seen on the news, there's lots of unstable air in the USA this week. Today Dallas is supposed to get hit hard.

cant move up????
"We just had 1800 death in US today due to this Virus. I feel terrible. I don’t think Airlines will come back for months, so as An investor I don’t think I want to be long and lock up my money for long time . I follow the cycles I buy then short sell and been making a bundle."
"This piece of ""garbage"" by Rick Smith made me laugh this morning. What a piece of Fool of Motley this dude is! Can you imagine he openly tells people to sell their long position in AAL? https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/09/why-american-airlines-stock-popped-5-this-morning/I smell that some shorts are getting truly crispier lately so they paid the Fools to convince the small investors since the big fish is not buying into it. The article has even provided a link to read on when to sell stocks. Just imagine this stock starts climbing like TESLA against all odds. I have seen a few more stocks I have traded in the last a few years which the stock priced climbed over 300% and the other one 1000% within six months. Their financials were horrendous as well. AAL stock price has gained 75% in value in the last 30 days of trading from 10/28 (the most recent lowest share price prior before the surge) through 12/09 when it reached the price of $18.63. During the first half of the month of November, the short position was reduced by 18%, 30.917 million shares, and the AAL share price closed with 11.5% gain however the stock has gained as much as 31% on the penultimate day of the same period. Notwithstanding, the short interest volume was almost identical in the second half of the month of November. There was no shrinking yet the gain in stock value was15.4%. In a nutshell, the stock has gained 42.4% in value while the short interest reduced by 18% in the month of November. It appears that the majority of gain in stock value was not due to the short coverage but increase in new long position. In the first 7 trading days of December, the stock has gained as much as 31.8%. Does that mean there are new AAL buyers in the market? In the past, based on my observation and data I collected, I would have said Shorts haven’t probably reduced their position significantly during the seven days. This is simply because the daily trading volume is higher in parallel to other figures such as price fluctuations in different time frequencies in December. This will be confirmed in a few weeks but my gut feeling is that the short interest has not changed by a lot. It usually happens when there is positive correlation between daily volume and price, both of which move downward and stays low for a certain period of time.In conclusion, what I have observed with ALL for more than 4 years is that, anytime stock gains value noticeably, it is usually two weeks and rarely as long as 4 weeks, it retreats a lot(I wrote on this in details multiple times in the past). This is now probably the longest period the stock is moving upward. We can expect a retreat because of it and also it is the last month of the year when the losing stocks most probably will be dumped into the market and I tend to think Travel and Leisure stocks are of them but not sure how much. I'd like to wait 20% drop minimum over the stock's most recent highest price of $18.63 to reconsider adding AAL shares slowly into my portfolio. This is simply because I want to buy them 10% below the price I sold two-thirds of my AAL shares. I wrote covered calls expiring by Christmas on the remaining. That's all the risk I can take at the moment before the turn of the year."
"@Bob ""American Airlines Group Inc. CEO Doug Parker said in October he was confident that any losses due to the Max grounding ""won't be incurred by American shareholders, but will be borne by the Boeing shareholders."" Maybe it means there will be Higher ""Return"" to ShareHolders through Bigger Share Buyback in 4Q, something like 20m shares???"
74mm short interest I’m. Buying for that reason alone
This is probably one of the best stock to short depending on how much it opens down Monday. I see this dropping below $5 eventually.
This is that time of the week again...I TOLD YOU SO! I said last week that AAL' share price will see low $22s before the earnings.
"Nothing to see here, it is like the last two days didn't even happen, unless of course you are short term trading."
Wow look at the relative strength today! fantastic.

"Parker has been the worst thing for AAL. Stock price almost $1 shy of its 52-week low!His terrible financial management (huge debt and buybacks on margin) and now this no information policy has AAL bleeding long-term investors. Soon whatever investors are left, will have waited 3 months to hear that AAL had a record flying season, and still failed to make any reasonable money, with its CASM projected around 5%."

"25K furloughs is terrible news for those employees+families, but in all reality, it helps adjust the bottom line for AAL in a positive manner.With the continuation of positive news from vaccines I would expect a rocky but solid climb into/through the fall."
News online AAL will be over $50-dollars tomorrow. Stock-up and win!
I really wish they would just raise the dividend significantly since the market will never give the stock price a fair multiple

"Do any of you day dreaming greenhorns know how to read financial statements? FYI American Airlines has NEGATIVE Shareholder's Equity at the end of March of MINUS $2.636 billion. This means.....""Negative shareholders' equity is a red flag for investors because it means a company's liabilities exceed its assets.""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/balance-sheet?p=AALhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/negative-shareholder-equity.aspAssuming April and May they burn cash at the rate of $70 million to (maybe) $50 million a day, they lose another $3.6 billion which means now their Shareholder's Equity will be NEGATIVE $6.236 billion by the end of this month.No wonder they're trying to borrow more money against their Loyalty Program but HELLO their Loyalty Program is actually a LIABILITY to AAL while it's an Asset to their customers who OWN these Loyalty Points. For those of you who know squat about Financial Statements, those Loyalty Points are going to be REDEEMED which means customers get flown around for FREE, bringing ZERO CASH to AAL while it still costs them $$$$ to fly their planes. How far do you think they'll get borrowing CASH against a LIABILITY?""While customer loyalty programs are a tried-and-true method of drumming up consistent business, potential risks must be carefully considered when implementing one into your company's marketing framework. Loyalty programs can result in more sales, but they also carry what is known as loyalty program liability.Loyalty program liability is the eventual cost to your company of the redemption of all outstanding loyalty points. If accounted for properly, they can be an effectively-wielded strategy for increasing customer engagement and strengthening the consistency of your company's relationships with clients.Conversely, failure to properly factor in the impact of these material financial costs on your company's balance sheet can have an unexpected financial cost upon redemption of outstanding rewards points.""https://www.kyrosinsights.com/blog/2018/07/25/loyalty-program-liability-guide"

Sales per Employee:DAL - $506.79KUAL - $455.00KAAL - $346.97K
It’s too bad...we used to get a nice bump when Bastien and Munoz delivered good news. Apparently no more
AAL is a big money maker from this price point. Excellent buying opportunity. Will be back up to at least $15 and higher within a couple of weeks. CEO says bankruptcies are off the table so no worries and American now has enough cash to get through all this with no problems. Flights are increasing on a daily basis. Analysts are starting to give the outperform BUY green light.
"I sit here and watch this they're trying to controlled it by selling more shares short and they cannot control it it's going up no matter what they do because it's all good from here the Economy is better profits are going to be better why short it at this point, Upwards from here 3 years over a $100 don't buy a car invest in 3 years by a car cash and have plenty of cash left over that's the smart thinking. Think about it, And this sacrifice with what you have for now and in 3 years you'll be able to buy a car cash with plenty of cash left over."
"Interesting that DAL is ACTUALLY increasing debt to buyback shares. From a media report:""Apart from reaffirming its fiscal 2019 financial targets, Bastian also said that it is taking a $1 billion short-term loan to accelerate share repurchases in the first quarter. Proceeds from the loan along with available cash will be used to repurchase $1.3 billion worth of its shares during the quarter.""DAL rose at that news -- even though DAL stock is almost 50% higher than AAL on similar earnings.One other oddity on the AAL presentation. While ""debt"" is now the four-letter word, nobody seems to care about capacity, which is the previous bugaboo. The game always changes."
Way past time to drug test/psychologically evaluate Parker...no sober sane lucid CEO would take a company like AAL coming out of BK and make the numerous consistent head scratching decisions Parker has made quarter after quarter then sabotage each quarter w counterproductive moves like he has unless he is on something that causes irrational bi polar like behavior or is just an extremely low IQ individual. Either way PARKER HAS TO GO!!!
"Given what's actually going on at this company and with the economy, owning this stock is WAY harder than it should be. Since Wall Street seems to be trying very hard not to care about these fundamentals, January should be interesting when the company will actually speak about its finances.BTW, I find it interesting that this forum has ""broken the story"" of AAL's important (and perhaps surprising) operational turnaround this year. With just about any other stock, you could have made a nice bit of money knowing this information before the rest of the Market did. But with AAL, knowing facts often doesn't seem to help."
"HA is the 1st to have the BUY Signal Today, based on MACD Golden Cross!AAL, DAL and UAL are on the verge to have their BUY Signal soon...This is your first hand view..."
"Mid $40s by Xmas still looks good to me for the moment. Given this volatile market, though, that opinion could easily change in a half hour. :)"

"Oil down over a $1.50 a barrel and crashing through $66. You would think, with AAL priced for $100 a barrel oil this would start effecting the share price. Jets still run of kerosene. Still the second biggest expense AAL should be trading in the fifty dollar range. Load up at these prices.."
"The longer Parker rambles, the further the stock drops."
"AAL has the advantage to guide lower Fuel and higher margin than expected due to their Late filing of 3Q report.If the oil stays this low, and even lower.DAL, being the first to report earnings when the oil looked to keep going, guided at least 15c/gal higher than necessary, Uncle has revised their margin Up 1.2%."

"This is “that time” of the week again….I TOLD YOU SO!-TimT (14 hours ago Replied to a reaction)-2.8% post market or $20.68 price will take my $19P 3/26 back to 115% profit. My hunch is that the share price will drop to low $20s before the close if no good news comes to the fore. If we close the week at the bottom, my surmise is that the stock price may even move below $20.-“XAL, JETS, and DJT are down and airlines with stronger balance sheets are doing worse than $AAL. So you know that suggests the AAL is trading based on sentiment. (TimT, 4 days ago)- TimT(8 days ago)I am just gonna get in and out of trades nowadays. I won't add any new shares to my long position which I have covered calls on them. I won't have any position in AAL unless the stock price drops below $20 or even $19 within 3-4 weeks. Let's see where the share price is gonna be until then.Things to remember: 1) The 2020 taxes need to be filed in 6 weeks.2) Any positive change in yields presents alternative investment opportunities to manage risks. 3) The trading trend has shown there happens a pull back once in every month at least. In other words, the traders will always have a better entry point that the present time.I think the market is going to pull back soon including the airline stocks in spite of the fact the airline index is probably doing better than all or most indexes. It has a gain of 25% for the year and 89% in the last six months however it is still in a loss territory, -3.5% as of yesterday, since the beginning of 2020. Maybe, the hedge funds will move the airline stocks up some more and then start selling shares once they are in the positive territory.I will wait low $18s to consider opening a long position assuming all my shares will be called away by the third week of March.

"Bought in around $12.50 and sold at $25.20. I don’t know why people have to hate on me for taking some profit. This thing is $3.00 away from it’s pre-pandemic price. Anyone with a brain knows this price is fundamentally wrong. But fundamentals haven’t matter much lately fortunately for all of us. Why can’t we be happy for each other? I hope this thing goes to $40, but I won’t be joining you in the ride. But don’t hate on me for meeting my goal."
"it's relatively a low volume day or rather near the old daily volume average. IMHO, that suggests the shorts are carefully pushing this stock price down. It's a 5% down in share price in the last two days without making any significant change in the short interest volume which is, I assume, significantly reduced in the month of February."
"Uncle upgrades Airlines to accumulate, starting next week when Uncle returns to USA."
ONG!!!. I just bought options. I hope it hits 25 by Friday
Primary motivation for AAL to be down today is the drop in DALs domestic load factor. Load factor itself is rarely material-- it's unit revenue that matters. We know nothing about Deals UR. I'm right now sitting on a 100 sold out AA flight. It's an off peak Tuesday. I am zero worried about Sales domestic demand. No other rational person is. But so what? This game is repeatedly irrational.
we smell 30$ this week already...
"I have a couple of hundred shares of AAL, even the price is doubled I will not earn a lot. But I will hold my shares just to support our airlines!!!"

Slow climb back up the Mountain. We close around $23.People always Over react.
Kinda ridiculous. Everyone getting vaccines. Many seniors ready to fly now and see their families. Economy turning up fast. Future cash flows for airlines are best for a year. Nothing but positive news for airlines coming day after day moving forward. Business travel will come back faster than some believe. International travel will lag but return in the fall after vaccines in other countries completely roll out. It will be an interesting year. My money is on the airlines as big winners this year.
"Probably a good sign that Jamie Baker at JP Morgan maintained AAL at ""overweight"" (although he dropped his price target by 3 bucks to $40). Like me, Baker has been in this game awhile and knows fundamentals. By his question on the conference call last Friday, I could tell he shares my frustration that the company simply isn't generating the RASM that -- based on a long history of good revenue management -- we believe they SHOULD be generating. And, like me, he suspects the problem is Scott Kirby's departure, and the failure to replace him with an equal talent. At the end of the day, I assume Baker believes what I believe: AAL isn't knocking it out of the park these days, but the stock price is so low that they'll be able to buy back the majority of their shares in a few years."
"Personally, I think it's really good for AAL stock to do nothing here and be essentiallu univestible. Remember, outside the noise, this stock -- unlike most in the Market -- has only 3 real risks: mass global war/terrorism, economic meltdown, and pandemic. Let's work through the pandemic risk -- and we slowly seem to be -- and let's see what happens to this stock this year on increased free cash flow."

Parker over promised and underperformed together with a huge debt load. He has lost credibility with the investment community.. Why is the board keeping him around?
"American and Southwest Airlines are signaling a return to international flying, bringing back flights to some destinations that haven’t been served since the COVID-19 pandemic halted most flights outside the United States.American Airlines relaunched its DFW to Madrid flight on Thursday aboard a Boeing 787, the first flight to continental Europe in several weeks.Southwest Airlines published flights to five Mexico and Caribbean destinations that have been out of service due to a drop in demand and government travel restrictions in some places. Southwest is selling tickets for flights to Havana, Montego Bay, Cabo San Lucas/Los Cabos, Cancun and Nassau for the first weekend of June.“Over the next few months, we’ll continue to expand our operation, reopen the skies and connect the world again,” said a note from American Airlines’ Joe Taney, senior vice president DFW. “We have a long road ahead of us, but we are optimistic about the future."
Time for gigadump!
Looks like I made a good choice selling at $25.20 this morning
"AAL is a truly undervalued stock at today's price of $34.83. The dividend is a very modest $.40 per year (or 1.1%). The often ignored earnings yield on current average earning estimate is 17.5%. To understand how inexpensive that is, if AAL were to increase the dividend to a modest 25% of this year's earnings (est is $6.10 per share) it would pay of $1.52 per share and yield 4.3%. When you can afford to have a dividend that is more than twice the market level (about 2%) and still retain over 75% of your earnings, your stock is very inexpensive. I can see why Mr. Parker is buying back shares instead of reducing debt or increasing the dividend, I realize that AAL has a cyclical business and that many airlines took a trip through BK over the past 20 years (that is how the current company acquired both US Air and American). Investors and especially analysts are far too pessimistic on the outlook for AAL. Not_A_Short"

"With 46 days left in the quarter (of 90 days), total PAX was at 38.11% of 2020, or down 61.89%, but that's NOT what the airlines have guided. It was at 40.09% of 2019, or down 59.91% in fact. This is more closed to what DAL has been guided. One thing Uncle could not find out if the Airlines are allowed to payoff the treasury their super low PSP loans early and get back the warrants they've issued?"
I agree with Kevin O’Leary. All of the airlines should be left alone to file for bankruptcy. No bailouts period! Business travel will never fully return. A whole lot of workers are going to be so happy that they can telework and not have to fly anymore. And businesses will save a small fortune.
Feb 2020 AAL has 426M stock worth about 11-12BToday it has 610M stock worth 10B+ . They also have billions in stock option with strike price below today's price & generate $7B in loss in that period.
"UAL >>> AAL >>> HA!What a domino effect!No wonder the ""Next Tuesday Long-term"" Shorts got so excited Today."
I'm so relieved that I found truly good trading guidance. https://financialnews.media/the-cure-for-financial-worries
35 mill share offering is nothing...Hold - $18.00 soon... $25.00 next January .
It feels like we might going to touch 12.50 today.
"Uncle - Your Tuesday is tops theory continues to erode. We need a new best day. I recommend Wednesday and I also recommend AA keeping a close eye on important business functions such as scheduling pilots during the holidays. We should have heard by now that whoever was in charge has been fired but unfortunately the union world protects these people. I spent 40 plus years in IT and a mistake like this, especially when it occurred last year is inexcusable yet it happened again. Using a 'computer glitch' excuse is pure BS since humans are in charge of insuring things are covered and they must do so well ahead of the actual schedule. I have lost faith in Mr. Parker and fear he is content to talk the talk but not walk the walk."
after hour Green!!! tomorrow we break today’s high $18.18!!!
"If my math is correct, Delta just added around 3,000 flights a day in August in their schedule load yesterday. I assume AAL will be similar or more."
"Pelosi holding Stimulus aid for the airlines hostage until the Republicans allow $400 Billion of Stimulus money to bail out Blue State Debt, including NY, CA and IL. As a taxpayer in FL why should I agree to a bailout of these States malfeasance."
I'm selling. Taking my profits while I can. Will buy back in at $12
This summer will be really hot for airlines 
Short interests still close to 30% at oversold. News of any reputable fund manager taking stakes in this company will pop at least 80% in this environment.
"American Airlines is the third carrier globally to resume flights following Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes and Mexico's Grupo Aeromexico earlier this month. Between those two airlines, the 737 MAX has flown about 250 commercial flights, according to Cirium, the aviation data firm. For more hot stocks like (AAL) just go to (http://trade-view.com)."
"Why does yahoo keep deleting my posts? Anyone having the same thing? I just posted 3x, none are showing up."
"My concern is we're running out of other majors to report great news that we can piggyback with our stock. Delta and now UAL gave us a ride. We're running out of airlines, Mr. Parker"
AAL has reduced its overall cost of debt. As someone once said - never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.Well played AAL. Now AAL is going to be a premier airlines.
get out there and fly fly fly - NOT ME
A very bad business made worse by the pandemic now returning to..........a very bad business.
"Confirmed cases in USA is approaching 800 with 28 death, mostly from Washington State (23).We have posters living int New York and Bay Area, please take good care of yourself...Uncle must repeat what Uncle said earlier; Parker did the best presentation ever in JPM conference, not saying that AAL won't lose money in 1Q, but the market should look beyond current quarter and believe that legacy airlines will not go BK again.AAL has secured $7.3bn, UAL $8bn after quickly raising $2bn extra as Kirby got scared, DAL has only $5bn."
30$+ next weekBuy and hold
$30 next week
Short squeeze is coming.After Wednesday all who closed accounts with Robin Hood can trade with their new accounts $27 by Friday
"All the US markets are up, oil is down 3%, and Surprise! today Parker raises the debt by $1B. AAL stock goes down, its market cap now at $13.5B and falling, its debt over double its market cap.Captain Parker continues to steers AAL down the toilet."
"So one of two things is happening to this stock, both of which are terrible. Possibility one is that there is more material non-public information about this company -- that even the analysts are completely unaware of -- that is causing the stock to trade as pathetically as it is. Option two is that whoever ""controls"" the price of this stock doesn't give a flying fig about the fundamentals and they don't matter.Take your pick."
15 bucks is best deal
"Oh, but we were going ""to the moon"" 20 then 25. The gummie bear curve was suppose to have ended this pandemic back in May. iahphx the fake is no where to be found. daniel is alter/other yahoo id is busy making new id's. Now the UK is being isolated as a new strain. Keep the liquor away from Parker, he doesn't need a 5th DUI right before Christmas."
wti going to go below $30/ barrel. will that help?
$AAL will touch $25 as air travel picking up...
traveling restrictions...schools and Universities shut down. businesses badly hurt for customers. sports venues shut down. we haven't seen anything yet
"Be careful of the Chinese stocks, the China #$%$s helped by the #$%$ WS bankers are dumping stocks like there's no tomorrow. Airlines are fine, it has Nothing to do with the Airline industry at all. Uncle knows the big banks have been helping the Chinese with their money stolen from China for some time."
"Ok, I’m now long AAL. I’ve grown to respect management over the years and I suspect the 737 Max crisis will “blow over” for American. Besides, based on earnings growth, AAL is cheap. Transportation of people is never an easy path but here technology is providing a big boost and, God, I hate to say it, but the sky’s the limit. Sorry."
already trending on RH boards
Aal back to 18$
If we close under the 50 day moving average we are in trouble. We going more down
I can honestly say that I have never shorted a single stock. It is immoral to profit from the misery of others. It is the polar opposite of investing and should be illegal.
Daily Record breaking passenger #'s and ALL Airlines are Down Again Manipulationthe USA stock market is the biggest non stop CROOKED SCAM
"Airlines down buy Airlines, Hi-Techs down Buy Hi-techs, Uncle's rebalancing has been working perfectly.Crazy kept chasing Hot Potatoes, Uncle only accumulates stocks Slowly but surely when they're down over nonsense. Even Doggie DAL is a BUY, regardless their HUGE Loss this quarter, they're paying down $1.5bn debts."
Looking good. 15-16 today
WTI traded at $50.06 today....
I am holding AAL bear call credit spread 18$ & $19. Expires tomorrow. Should I buy that at a loss today or wait till tomorrow??? Help.
Right now you shouldn’t use margin and you need to play the long game. The second this virus recedes it’ll be too late to react the moves will already be in. I think long leaps make the most sense here. I just hate the elevated premiums
"Buffett's company reported owning 44.7 million shares of AAL, a decrease of 1.3 million from 46.0 million the previous quarter. As written yesterday, this small decrease was not reflective of ""management’s views as to the relative attractiveness of the bought and sold securities but were rather a response to the 10% limitation.""I'm not surprised, but there are about a half a dozen posters here who will be; they obviously don't understand Buffett and all and probably don't understand AAL at all either."
"Current AAL average earnings estimates are $6.08 for 2019 (vs AAL's guide of $5.50 - $7.50), $6.37 for 2020, $6.75 for 2021. Remarkably stable and growing estimates for a sub-6 PE stock, don't you think?"
"you obviously don't know anything about the market , how are those shorts doing"
"In my previous post, I called for caution for specific reasons I have discussed. Today's TSA number is very encouraging but I still think we will have a better opinion by weekend if there is any negative sentiment building in air-traveling. I learned when I was a kid that winter is not over until March is over. So maybe we should not expect high growth in WoW in another month or so. I have mentioned that I had bought weekly and bi-weekly calls deep ITM a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, I had to let go the stocks I was assigned at the start of the last week before the weekend due to my brokerage firm doubled the margin levels for long positions and also I was going to be assigned some more shares over the weekend. I have sold them as well for an average price of $20.65 this morning. In other words, I was supposed to increase my long position by 150%. Now I am back to my earlier position. This is also because of what I have said in my earlier post yesterday. Well, now, I hope to have available capital and I will write some OTM bi-weekly puts but not too far OTM. I can risk the recent gains from the calls. As of today, I am up about 53% on $AAL for the year, 2021. I will wait to see if the share price drops to $20 or below and write puts $19."
"Anyone who has been paying attention should not have been surprised by the secondary, especially as other airlines have not been punished for issuing them.In fact, he act removes the largest uncertainty related to the stock. And as counter-intuitive as it is the price of the stock will likely move up as the underwriters have a vested interest to make it so. Wall Street is fair & logical...sure..So that it comes back to the Covid-19 being the hope. The 2nd wave story is just about played out.People want to move on and are moving on. If you are not seeing this, you are probably deluding yourself.Noise, noise, noise.....is all it is, as the rational know that avoiding extended talk zone exposures of others in poorly ventilated spaces and contracting it is very unlikely.. Meanwhile....the growth track continues and AAL will be cash flow positive by year end. Unemployment claims going down and TSA pass thrus going up"
"470,000 round trip tickets per MONTH will fund INTEREST on AAL debt."
Anyone regret not selling at $25?
"Simpletons and their simple math.....they can't even seem to do simple math much less know accounting or bothered to read a financial statement. This line always bears reposting:""Based on our current forecast, we expect to have approximately $11 billion of liquidity at the end of the second quarter, assuming no material, unforecasted revenue reductions, costs or other events.""Cannot declare bankruptcy just to improve your cost structure...with the $11 billion no where within this year would AAL be in danger of not making their debt payments or violate their covenants that would cause a default"
Jet fuel down another 4 cents to $1.81. We're getting close to the short-lived 12-month low last December in the $1.70s. Remarkable turn of events. I wonder when anyone will notice.
What just happened
Kind of strange that more investors are not rejoicing in the low stock price. Stocks are one of the few things that buyers complain about when they go on sale. Not_A_Short
"Aal is only cutting 20,000 employees as opposed to ual which is cutting 30000-40000 employees. I think we can infer that aal has been the busier airline. We can expect decent earnings on 7/23 I think. Dal earnings was bad due to bad investment in other international airlines that bankrupted. Am I wrong to assume this?"
Over 34 billion in debt and climbing with declining reserves.
"""Investing"" in airline stocks has always been difficult, but we've obviously entered into a new and worse cycle this year. I've always told folks that ""reality"" isn't that important when it comes to investing, but that the ""perception of reality"" is. A classic example would be the ebola scare: it didn't immediately matter that ebola wasn't likely to spread around the world, but the perception that it could mattered a lot.What we're getting this year though is different from this. As AAL stock has declined by almost a third, nobody really knows what ""investors"" are worried about. It's obviously nuts to think that the entire value of the company is worth a third less because of a short term and relatively modest blip in oil prices. And this is from a level that by no objective level was AAL ""priced for perfection"" or otherwise ""expensive.""So now I suppose the biggest thing to worry about is ""trade tensions."" I haven't read anything that suggests that our trade disputes with China will knock more than a couple tenths off GDP numbers. In the past, all airline analysts have pegged airline unit revenue growth largely to GDP. Those numbers have been fantastic the past year, and a couple tenths off would still be fantastic. Yet, we have at least one airline analyst (Linenberg) who now worries about that trade dispute with AAL already down a third.I am a bit concerned that airline stock prices are now basically like oil prices. That there is no amount of research or knowledge that you can use to predict the stock prices. Nobody has been successful the past decade in consistently predicting oil prices. I am afraid that nobody will now be successful in predicting airline stock prices going forward. I know I will be more cautious in my future ownership, as I will not treat my shares as an asset that is somehow tied to the ""real worth"" of the companies. In other words, you kind of have to agree with the people who view these stocks as ""trading vehicles"" even if the reality of the current airline industry would indicate that they SHOULD be treated as real assets. This kind of sucks, as I think I could make more money by using superior knowledge to value the companies ""correctly,"" but as an investor you can't see the market as it ""should be,"" but have to see it as it actually is."
As COVID-19 cases decline precipitously AAL price should increase exponentially.
"25$, here we come! "
"Ahead of the market and airlines earnings, Raymond James raised LUV target from $54 to $71, ALK from $65 to $85. UAL guided 1Q Revenue of $3.2bn, consensus $3.29bn. UAL reiterates CORE cash flow positive for March and so for the future, and ($9m)/day for 1Q21."
Not gonna get greedy. Sold just now $AAL and $JBLU. Good luck all.
Is this gonna be the next GME/AMC??
"each time we are told AAL is dead, we throw a surprise party for them! "
Airlines and cruise lines are going to skyrocket. Inevitable. People are going to travel. Business will travel. Might sell off some of my slow burn tech stocks to get on this and $CL know we will see $aal at $45-50 by mid 2021 and $CCL same story.We all knew travel would be the last to rise from the grave.Double down folks
"The shift from active investing to passive is setting up investors for failure. This shift is taking place at a time when market valuations are at an extreme. Growth stocks (like AMZN) are very highly valued and Value stocks (like the airlines) are very undervalued. Given that passive investing is done using market capitalization (instead of earnings), this mean that funds being shifted into passive are buying a lot more overvalued stocks and a lot less undervalued stocks - just about the opposite of what any rational investor would do.Few are preparing investors for the likely result of this situation. I suspect subpar returns for passive investors that could easily stretch beyond their ability to stay the course. Once again investors will claim the market is rigged against them. Very few senior wall street figures are warning about this situation - they remain silent (as they usually do). Wall street is not exactly a place where profiles in courage are found. Not_A_ShortNot_A_Short"
I own both LUV and AAL. LUV has performed much better for me longer term. Do I sell what little I have of AAL and buy more LUV on a dip?
"11,791 Confirmed Cases, 259 death in China, as of 1/31/2020 China time.Hubei Province where Wuhan City is in, and probably lots of the 5m escaped Wuhan residents went to their relatives reported 7,153 cases and 249 death. Outside Hubei was only 10 death.. Not counting tons of people who died before getting a chance to be confirmed."
"Life goes on. Going to be back to normal in 30-60 days. If you’re not buying AAL, you will wish you did. Think about it.........."
"People stop pumping. There are real people trying to invest their savings. It anger me to read all the irresponsible pumping taking place telling people to buy. Get a conscious! I am long on the airline industry but you got to be reasonable about what is happening in the real world.(I wrote this answering to a posing). Even if everyone were to be vaccinated today and could fly tomorrow. It will take sometime before a full blown economic recovery takes place. I am long on AAL but here some perspective.The legacy airline with the most cash and the airline in North America with the best position to ride the Covid crisis is Air Canada. AC CEO Calin Rovinescu said “Realistically, we expect it to take at least three years for Air Canada to get back to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity,”Here is why I think he said that....Many people lost their jobs and have accumulated, debt; mortgage deferral payments, unemployment is high, etc... Large amounts of business have gone under and many more will in the next months, no revenue, no liquidity, debt, etc...During the 2007 subprime crisis the worst financial year was 2008. I hope to be wrong but it might get worst before it gets better, 2021 might be financially more troublesome year than 2020.Airlines today are operating at 1/5 or less capacity. A 1/5 of AAL 52 week high of $30.78 is only $6.15. Even being optimistic and forward looking towards the future at 1/3 it translates to $10.00 per share. Today's closing at 17.99 is near 57% of it's 52 week high. The airline is operating at 1/5 or less and loosing money everyday. This is way out of reality in all metrics by a long shot.The return of 737 maxx would be great news if there was demand. AAL CEO Doug Parker vaccine distribution plan is commendable. Flight capacity and occupancy are two different beasts. Demand will slowly and gradually return to pre-covid levels but It will take two to three years.and them there will another problem. Shortage of pilots, Just before the pandemic, the airlines were struggling to find pilots. Attritions, cut back and mayhem labor disruption caused by the pandemic compounded an already existing problem the airlines will have to face once demand begins to resume. Anyway....hope my comment was beneficial in order for you to make an educated decision."
"Guys The annual loss of the company is approximately 19 dollars per share ... Debts on the company are in the billions ... Economic stimulus is paid in salaries and the company does not benefit from it ... In the medium term, there is no increase in the number of travelers ... This company is a suicide for the investor ..."

"This is not rocket science. Doug Parker seems to be a little slow in the uptake. Oils been rising all year. Parker promised nice profits. The two don’t correlate unless you raise ticket prices along with rising fuel prices. Today at least, he FINALLY mentioned that ticket prices MUST start up. He’s a little late but at least he is the only CEO who has come out and said - somethings gotta change.. Another $20 a ticket and the $3-$5B yearly profit is back in play."
"Only 10% of the total population is affected by covid19. The other 90% have no idea they had it or have it. Vaccines won't put people back on planes because they won't be mandatory. The job cuts have people traveling to much closer destinations by car. The airline industry will not come close to recovering for at least 3 years. Business travel will not come back to 2019 levels for over a decade. Vaccine or no vaccine air travel will remain in the red. Payroll protection or not, the inevitable bankruptcy process is still coming for American and United. If they extend the aid package, it's only because the election is months away. I assure you, there will be no extensions after the next package expires assuming the airlines get it. I do not believe it was just to give it to them in the first place, however a second package should be based on safe business practices and American and United would have already failed to qualify for it."
"Aside from being utterly confused about this stock and happily excited all at the same time, I can't understand any of its moves. Today we are up almost 1% in the midst of all the confusion and fear about Corona, while the entire sector is red. Thoughts?"
I am really looking forward to the day that the shorters of AAL are sent packing with only their losses to keep them company.

"Guys, don’t sell now."
"At this point, you just need to ask yourselves two questions:1. Does AAL have the wherewithal to survive a bad 2-3 months? The answer should obviously be yes.2. Is the business model broken? The answer should also be obvious, no.If you concur, then your are buy or hold.....Americans fear level is about 2-3 weeks max then they start looking for bargains. I might got corona, but the plane didn't crash and I saved $83!"
"AAL didn't really pop with the $14 billion bailout, so I'm a little concerned. Let's face it, the market is tapped out, but AAL isn't. Really tough decision right now. Whether to sit on the sidelines for a few weeks and allow the indexes to come back to earth or stay long and strong. Not sure. hmmm"

"So we broke through all the moving averages, now we have an upward trending support line around $27, drawn from the $24.45 august low and $25.25 October low. That would be nice to hold."
"American Airlines customer service is in dire needs of being revamped. Recently American checked my bag in under another name and not to my final destination. I incurred an extra fee for having to recheck my bag, which meant I had to exit the airport to claim my bag and recheck it in AND go through airport security again American only reimbursed me for the fee but no miles for the inconvenience. Is American just hanging on by a thread where customers are no longer put first?"
I'm going to take my profits today and buy back
"American Airlines has the largest commercial fleet in the world. I think that they will do very well when pent up demand is released this spring and summer. They took advantage of the pandemic downturn to retire older jets in their fleet, so they are also flying with newer, more fuel-efficient planes. The potential for significant gains is real and dare I say imminent."
Boeing's CEO said over the weekend he doesn't see air travel getting back to pre-covid numbers for three years. Not my words his words

"If Buffett Is Buying Airlines, Competition Is Over: Joe NoceraA stable industry is good for the stock bulls but bad for fliers.By Joe Nocera(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In 1989, when Warren Buffett made his infamous purchase of USAir’s preferred stock, there were at least 20 major airlines operating in the U.S. — carriers with names like Pan Am, Eastern, Braniff and Continental.He bought USAir’s stock, he later said, because the company had a long track record of profitability, and because he was a fan of its chief executive, Ed Colodny. What Buffett hadn’t counted on was the fierce competition for passengers among the carriers. Within a year Colodny was out, the airline was losing buckets of money and the stock went into a tailspin.Although Buffett wound up making a small profit when he sold the USAir stock in the mid-1990s, the experience soured him on the airlines for the next two decades. In his regular letter to shareholders, and at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, he couldn’t say enough bad things about airline stocks. He used to describe airline competition, for instance, as “kamikaze pricing tactics.” And who can forget the time he remarked that “if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville [Wright] down”?This little trip in the wayback machine is prompted by the news, posted Friday morning by Bloomberg, that Buffett now owns so much stock in the four remaining major airlines that people are speculating he might just decide to buy one of them outright. According to Bloomberg’s Katherine Chiglinsky, Buffett’s biggest holding is Delta Air Lines Inc., in which he has a $3.6 billion position — more than 10 percent of the stock. But he also has $2.8 billion worth of Southwest Airlines Co., $1.78 billion worth of United Continental Holdings Inc., and $1.38 billion worth of American Airlines Group Inc. Last month, when rumors circulated on social media that Buffett might buy Southwest, the stock rose 3.6 percent.The Bloomberg story got me wondering about when, exactly, Buffett changed his mind about airline stocks. The answer turns out to be 2016 — which makes perfect sense. The previous October, US Airways, as USAir was then known, took its final flight before being merged into American Airlines. That deal was the last in a decade-long frenzy of airlines mergers, of which the two biggest were United’s 2010 merger with Continental, and Delta’s 2008 purchase of Northwest Airlines. With the completion of the American-US Airways deal, those 20-plus carriers had been reduced to four. And as the number of carriers fell, the competition between them was reduced.Which is precisely what appealed to Buffett. Of course, Buffett doesn’t phrase it like that, and neither do other airline stock bulls. Instead, they say things like “The industry has become stable,” or “The airlines are behaving like adults,” or “They’ve learned to operate with more discipline.” The truth is that all four airlines set prices now that are more or less the same — consumer-friendly fare wars are a thing of the past. They all have learned to maximize seating capacity, so they’re not trying to poach customers from one another. And they all use the same galling techniques for raising ancillary revenue, like making travelers pay to check their bags. (Southwest is a little better on this front.)While the government stood by, the airline industry became an oligopoly. That’s what Buffett understood. The four major airlines no longer have any incentive to compete — indeed, any effort to increase competition can only hurt profits for all of them. If Buffett believed that airlines still competed, he would still be avoiding the stocks. Or maybe he’d buy the one he thought would win. By buying shares of all four companies, he is signaling that he is no longer worried about airline competition. He knows the four of them will play nice, which will be good for his portfolio.This same lack of competition has been terrible for consumers. Airlines were deregulated to inject competition into the industry; here we are 40-plus years later, and competition has been largely wiped away. Although prices are lower than they were during the era of regulation, in every other way, air travel is worse for the consumer than when carriers were regulated. The Department of Justice under President Barack Obama did not serve the country well when it waved through one big airline merger after another.Which is another way of saying, just because something is good for Warren Buffett doesn’t mean it’s good for the rest of us."
Ok... flight time once again...
Bargain basement pricing this morning on AAL. Hedge funds are taking full advantage of their short positions to exacerbate the knee-jerk reaction to the J&J vaccine. Everyone I know who has received a vaccine has not gotten the J&J one. Ahh the smell of opportunism in the morning.
"It's Friday, the expiration date for options so looking at the overall market, the stock price maybe lower but it is short lived. If the share price doesn't pick up even if it a little later in the day, the stock price should and will move upward next week. The events that may prevent it is the occurrences of any major incidents before inauguration, market crush, and more importantly increase in options for the following week of inauguration. It is more important because I think the risks for the first two possibilities appear to be lower at the moment.I am holding on to my and not even writing covered calls. I was hoping to have a little up move at the opening to write bi-weekly CCs but it didn't happen. So I'll sit tight for the time being."
AAL is so youthful: 42 is the new 50!
Just sold my small add at $37.20. Also sold some Jan $45 puts last week when it was in low $38s at $6.50.
Anyone have any idea why we are down again today by 2%? Haven't seen any major news in the negative?
"Expectation is that vaccinations will bring the covid under control globally so travel will kick off. This stock touched 58 in 2018. With all the debt, AAL will be back in business very shortly, so this is possible to cross 30 by June 2021. Again it depends on the success of vaccination."
if this crosses $10 afterhours. we will see $11 by friday v
In Mexico it’s easy to get tested. They now have labs inside the airport and results within 30 minutes.
How many shares did the hedge funds short to bring the price down in an unfair market?
This stock will be up three dollars by Friday. After UAL and HA release their info it will spike on traders taking advantage of the depressed price.. World has not quit flying. GDP is at 4.2% and people still need to fly to get somewhere. Better load up here for a quick 10 to 15% gain then a steady climb back to rational prices. Oil prices declining as well. Get your tray tables in the upright and locked position. AAL is down 20% on very light volume for a move that large. It will retrace just as quick. Light volume moves while the institutions sit on the sideline is just short term exploitation of liquidity.
"One criticism of Parker is that he doesn't do a good job ""explaining things"" to investors. This is an interesting issue because it's obvious that ""investors"" do a horrible job of processing the information Parker does tell them. I think this explains why Parker doesn't think it's useful to speak more often. On the other hand, he holds regular meetings with employees to talk about the business. These are often recorded and are called ""Crew News"". If you listen to these sessions (many of them are leaked on the web) you see that Parker is astonishingly good at explaining the complex world of airline management to pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, mechanics, etc. You can also tell that Parker has his eye on the ball and is still as sharp as ever with the ""vision thing"" of building a successful -- and highly profitable -- airline. This makes me optimistic about what will happen Thursday, but makes me more optimistic of what is going to happen with this company over the next couple of years. We've seen in the past week the good that Kirby has done for UAL -- despite all the criticism that investors have leveled on him the past few years. I am 100% certain the same will happen with Parker. I've been watching these guys for almost 2 decades and I know that Kirby is very good. I still think it's a shame that AAL lost him. But I'm also pretty certain that Parker is better than Kirby. Since you can't really have both forever, I think AAL is lucky to have Parker. This should become obvious over the next couple of quarters."
"USA has 100million doses of vaccine available by Dec if the Pfizer phase 3 trial shows effective which is to start in 1-2week. USA paid 1.9 billion dollars, highest amount among all the vaccines USA has procured. That’s 4-5 months and if markets are forward looking that’s not priced in airline and cruise industries. We have vaccine fatigue right now but it’s coming."

I think we might be on the precipice of something here. There is a very big bet on bankruptcy. The question is this a capitulation situation or not. I never remember seeing this before with any disease or pandemic for that matter I seriously question the point of WHO they are beyond corrupt to not classify this as a pandemic is at best incompetent and at worst criminal and a total dereliction of duty. Having said that I think we need to brace for millions of cases of this virus and that includes for the homeland. NYC has lost control at this point the spread in the US and across the world is too great for one of the worlds best cities to handle for now. New York City will rise once more but the situation here is going down hill fast here and I don’t see it getting better anytime soon. The city is afraid right now and that’s not an easy thing to see it resembles 9/11 but that was short lived this virus can go on for an unknown length of time. I’m still a believer in Leaps for AAL but that’s the situation in NYC
"""Our passenger revenues, while still growing, trailed the growth rates of our two largest competitors. This occurred for the first time since 2016 in the first quarter of this year, but it widened in the second quarter.

When will Parker start ""Narrowing"" the Gap?We don't know, and they don't say.The guessing goes on and on...All these made Bob looks a genius!"
Wow. This is a horrible time to be invested in airlines apparently. Market soaring again and here we are. Ugh.
"Baker finally came after Cowen ...JPM raised DAL target from $49 to $63, ALK from $65 to $104, JBLU with $25, ...Raymond James raised UAL frim $40 to $80..."
"The same old story over and over again ... slowly bleeding after the morning pop, we might hit a power hour before the bell to keepUs above $13 . Fingers crossed"
Wow. This price is amazing. At least there's one buyer with $2 billion to spend. Amazing how an airline could be worth so much less based on 50 cents in lost earnings due to fuel. You'd think you'd need some real structural problem with the business.
"Here we are in a good economy, oil has been rising for a year and the air fares haven't budged. So far the ULCCs seem to be setting the prices for air fares and baggage fees. All AAL can do is reduce costs and the employee count, none of which Parker has shown he can do. His skill set appears to be limited to borrowing money to buy back shares way above market value, which has not ever been a good financial plan, particularly now in an environment of rising oil costs and rising interest rates.I don't see how this 3rd quarter will be anything more than a continuation of the dismal 2nd quarter. Parker needs to step down."
Astrezeka is reporting on there Covid testing on Monday. UAL has an earnings report on July 21st. AAL has there earnings on July 23. Should be a wild week.

Overall new infections are down 20% even accounting for a slight rise in China infections. South Korea only has 27 critically ill and I highly suspect they will start on their recovery curve this weekend which will mitigate new cases for the most part in the 500-650 range. Likely will start seeing a couple hundred recoveries. Italy is also reduced back to 500-600 and will likely this weekend and beyond be better able to mitigate the new numbers
Any word anywhere on Boeing compensating airlines for lost income from grounding?
"AA at any normal day can operate if 30 jets are out of service. They can maneuver and make it work. However, for weeks now, there have been on average 65 jets out of service at the beginning of the day. This is not including any MAX cancellations. The real 35 jet deficit results in huge cancellations. Not only are aircraft out of position but crews are stranded. It all flows downhill. It’s crushing the operation and morale."
"Thanks to the ramping up of VERY enthusiastic post-covid travelers, no matter what the short term, AAL will be going higher than 25. Not sure how much higher, spikes maybe to 28 or so, higher than 25 nonetheless. Bank on it. Only shorts will tell you otherwise."
"Anyone watch Parker on CNBC the other day begging for taxpayer handouts? Sorry Parker, its called KARMA. You have mistreated passengers for over a decade, nickel and dimed passengers, loaded up huge change fees penalties on passengers (forcing them to fly when they are sick or essentially lose the ticket), then turned coach seating into class warfare that separated families. Your outdated pricing structure and business model is destined to take you straight to bankruptcy. You have failed to lead but instead chose to follow.People have shown they can do without the traveling hassles over the last 6-8 months and no one is missing it. Airlines need to change or go extinct. Someone tell me why it costs over $500 for a 180 mile trip, which I can drive in less time than flying (driving to airport early, waiting, flying time). Why is it flights with 1 or 2 stops are cheaper than non-stop flights? Every stop is time, wear and tear, extra maintenance, extra labor costs,...etc.The traveling public does not need to change, the airlines need too!"

"Has anyone calculated the cash flow for Q4? I'm sure management is chomping at the bit to buy back stock in the $20s, as it's pretty much a gift from the heavens. The question is how much cash they'll have to do so. The other factor is how ""stable"" the profit forecast looks. It seems like the economy will be fine (AAL doesn't need a ""great"" economy, just an OK economy, to make lots of money). The other factor is oil: everyone under-appreciates the HUGE short term impact on jet fuel prices on profit. I was a bit worried that the attack on the Saudi refinery might dent Q4 profitability, but that turned out to be a big nothing -- at least so far. I still think a Mideast war is the single biggest risk factor to AAL's profitability (not a huge risk, but the biggest risk). Of course, in this business, there's always something from left field."

"CLEVELAND, Ohio — American Airlines is adding new flights from Cleveland Hopkins to New York LaGuardia and Reagan Washington National airports to counter recent cuts on both routes from United.The new flights will start in June.Service to Washington will go from three times daily to four times daily, and three of the four flights will be on larger aircraft, for a total of 150 additional seats between the two airports.American service to LaGuardia will stay at four-times daily, but will use larger aircraft, increasing from a 44-seat Embraer ERJ-140 to a 76-seat E-175, with first-class seating. The increase will also add another 150 seats to the route.American’s announcement comes less than a month after United said it was dropping both LaGuardia and Washington Reagan from its Cleveland schedule, angering many loyal United fliers in Northeast Ohio.At the time, United said it was trying to move more Cleveland traffic to its nearby hub airports — Newark International, outside New York City, and Dulles International, outside Washington.But many business travelers prefer LaGuardia and Reagan National, because they are closer to the central cities."
Super Thursday is Coming ... Super!
Doug Parker: listen to Ed Bastian on how to communicate.Follow him on how to run an airline which is now worth TWICE your larger airline. TIA
I’m new to this but here is my my 2 cents. Airline stocks pull and drag each other up and down. The big upswing this month started with UAL and AAL upgrading their estimates and then backed with good numbers from DAL. If UAL reports are good late today and reinforced with good numbers from AAL in the morning —. We will all enjoy the ride! If not we will be taking the slide.
Shorts are not expecting this. I can easily say Haha! Just for today.
wow what is going?

"Lots of new investors out there , they know travel is coming back soon. American is the least expensive major airline stock there is . It started it's drop when Boeing 737 Max had problems.

Uncle Buffett was forced to file Form 3 on LUV after exceeding 10% Ownership. either he has bought more LUV stock or it's due to LUV's lower Share Count that forced Buffett's holding to exceed 10%.
"I think the Market over-reacted to news that Trump is suspending stimulus talks. Reality check: both sides want to give the airlines money. It's basically crony capitalism at this point (or insuring ""essential services"" if you prefer). The election will simply delay these checks from being written. They will still get the money. AAL has plenty of liquidity and can wait until after the election. Or perhaps next week both sides decide it's better to write checks before the election. Nobody should really care much."
It will be an extraordinary week for American Airlines. It's stock will skyrocket to almost to $26.00. People begins to fly again. Take the next fly before the airplane take off. American is still one of the most important airlines in USA. It's performance will improve as people return to their normally lives.

"""Boeing Co. grounded dozens of 737 Max jets to repair an electrical flaw that emerged in recently delivered models, forcing airlines to cancel flights and line up replacement aircraft.U.S. carriers including Southwest Airlines Co., American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. parked a combined 67 of the workhorse planes Friday, about a third of the Max jets in service worldwide. The manufacturing glitch affects a subset of aircraft at 16 airlines, not the entire Max fleet, Boeing said in a statement.""Uncle only counted 63, not 67. Only saw AAL grounded 10 of them immediately while LUV and UAL didn't seem to care, or to be more accurately, they're already in the Air or not having enough time to cancel.That said, Jefferies said it'll be an easy Fix, Uncle wonders if it's as easy as Uncle's recent experience of getting my Lexus recall done in a day? It won't be as simple as getting a Free rental car to drive home for sure. Anyway, this is NOT going to affect current earnings report, and it can be very minor problem if they fix the problems quickly. Airlines will be compensated with future credits or discounts."

"We need planes. We need airlines. Everyone here would lose there shut if they could not use air travel anymore. So the way I see it is. Because this was not the airlines fault. Everyone and anyone who ones an airline right now would fail. It's a global pandemic. So that being the case I don't think its fair to let the airlines fail. Because if this pandemic happens again, and according to some doctors it may. Do we want future airline owners to over charge flights because they need to save for a possible future pandemic? Or do a whole brand new buch of airlines go out of business as well. Airlines clearly cost alot to keep up. So they should be given special exception and kept afloat. Considered essential for restarting the economy. That's just my take. I'm looking for some stocks to day trade. If I wasn't worried about it going bankrupt I would be more willing to commit at this price. So is this a total insider stock? Where if you know it's going to get government money to stay afloat nomatter what then you stick around? I have no idea. Maybe the best choice is to put money in an airline stock that won't be the first to fold. This way you can see what happens first to the other guy. Right? Probably not. Things move so quick nowa days. If one airline went down, wouldn't be long before shareholders bail on the rest of them. Causing more airlines to fail and contributing to a possible future depression. So I don't think Trump will let the airlines fail. I mean he owned one. He knows it's hard to run... Then again. Maybe the other airlines put the Trump planes out of business and now Trump wants to get back at them? I don't think that though, I think Trump wants to get the economy started nomatter what. And if an airline going out of business is going to slow that down, then he won't let it happen. My opinion. Going to read a little and see what y'all are saying."
"With flights returning to near pre-pandemic levels in the summer for AAL and an impending return to profitability, if today’s price action isn’t manipulation, nothing is. Ridiculously low volume is making it possible for the funds to suppress the price. It will break out once the buyers wake up."

How is LYFT still realistically worth $6bil more than AAL? Not necessarily even knocking LYFT's valuation here, but moreso highlighting how undervalued AAL truly is here."

"The sad thing is the markets gave us the perfect warning. Shanghai composite dropped 10% in one day, but US futures were green and everyone just followed the herd! AAL topped $30 and nobody was worried about Coronavirus. Viruses go viral. The effort to contain the virus is going to destroy so much business, which has a cascading effect on other business. This is a marker crash for the history books."
I am tired of Warren Buffet. Tired of him
"There wont be any recovery for this stock as long as Doug Parker remains as CEO and Chairman. Down over 25% this year and over 50% from all time high, the company is totally mismanaged by Parker. A class action lawsuit should be stated against the Board for not replacing this incompetent individual."
AAL just got a shot in the arm with cash infusion from stock sale . Might at first glance concern shareholders ? The reality is they now have cash to make it through the pandemic and come out stronger with a new efficient fleet of planes ( Bonus since fuel cost will increase with new admiration) Bottom line is they just shrugged off the shorts who were betting they would go bankrupt-NOT HAPPENING.Shareholders now will benefit from longs and potential frenzy from Reddit and possible hedge funds betting the opposite from the shorts .
"For all those that gave me Down votes in December when I presented the case of that DB Airline Industry downgrade at 8:53 am the day of vaccine approval. The S/P of AAL that day was lower than Friday. The analyst said at 17, the next two years of travel demand was baked in, and thus overvalued. Yet the SAME bank just upgraded today when it close at 18.7 on Friday. Think about that and let this think in. I said that day that this was going to happen."
I added 1500 shares. This stock will basically double during the summer. Keep this post
AAL is 18% for the year as of NOW!
"Don't sell , after hours will be good !"
"theres absolutely no reason to buy this anytime soon. all the ratings and analysts say avoid, and the virus panic will last another month or two making people not want to sit shoulder to shoulder on an airplane. sales will drop even without flight cancellations abroad. the inevitable headlines will keep coming and airlines and cruise ships will get hit so much harder than they already have"
Is AAL still popular that ppl buy airticket in USA?I bought some AALstocks. I live in Canada that's why I wonder..
"Looks like we're going to see how well Parker' ""Risk Management"" strategy works, here's his ""brilliant"" strategy:1/ raise the debt to $33B by using all of AAL' assets as collateral2/ use the borrowed money to buy back shares, mostly at $40+ per share3/ maintain the debt, pay the interest, adding $500M+ annually to the cost of those $40+ shares4/ keep $7B available so Moody's doesn't drop their ratings, raising AAL' debt interest ratesIn summary, borrow as much as possible and then use the monies to buybacks shares.What could go wrong, debt is cheap?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking again. We hope you enjoyed your flight so far, we apologize for that bit of turbulence, but I believe everyone enjoyed the scenic view over Mount Amazing Gains.We’ll be starting our descend here shortly. We ask that you buckle your seat belts and watch the beautiful landscape as we touch down. Everyone here at American thanks you for flying with us today. Please be sure to high five your captain on your way out.Have a beautiful day, and thanks again from $AAL."

you've got to love Yahoo finance bs. They say now it's a good time to buy airlines. Like they weren't worth it when they were lower? Most of us held and added to our position with the dips this past 12 months. Sure they are still down for the year but now they get bullish on airlines. I usually do whatever YF suggests and it's served me well.
2 long years in the making and a very nice close for the 3 day weekend.
cheaper oil ~~ Buffet coming over to buy an airline (rumor) ~~ cheap valuation.....take your pick....airlines on a tear while the valuation is dirt cheap....a recipe for higher prices coming soon..

"If you’re interested in holding a stock for more than a month, most airlines are in decent position. Granted liquidity to pay employees and a vaccine isn’t far off - prob late fall. I have a close friend who flies for American and airports/flights are full. Don’t miss the upside worrying about a little more on the down."
I’m in this thing fir 29 and change. Guess I’m in better shape than buffet
we are dissapointed by AAL behaviour (as usual). it should have been over 22$ by now.It seems it is an easy victim of the short shellers speculators

"The Call Options are unproportionately higher than puts. It means if there is big money behind it, the stock price should be higher. Any decline at this point suggests otherwise."
"Very choppy trading on very low holiday volume. Looks clear that today is an easy day to manipulate the stock price. See ya'll next week. Had a fantastic quick trip to south america. Flew on the second to last DFW-OAK flight yesterady before they shut it down tomorrow. All 4 AAL segments were on time or early, and service was excellent even in coach. LATAM and SKY in SA were .... fine. Definitely about what you would expect in a poorer country. Anyway, as a customer of AAL I was happy, unlike Jack. Also got some amazing photos of the eclipse. I'll get them up on instragram and put that up here next week if anyone cares."
Great finish to the day!

British Airways reveals world-first trial of Covid test that gives results in 25 SECONDS as travel is set to resume on May 17: 'Game-changer' swab will be tested on cabin crew ahead of roll-out
"NEWS: Airlines get jump on preparations to transport COVID-19 vaccineThere isn't an approved COVID-19 vaccine just yet, but preparations are already underway for its distribution -- including any extreme temperature requirements.American Airlines announced this week that its cargo operation has started conducting trial flights from Miami to South America to test its process of shipping vaccines.That includes stress testing a trial of ""a major pharmaceutical company’s thermal packaging,"" CEO Doug Parker said in a LinkedIn post earlier this week.Parker said the airline ""successfully moved"" the thermal packaging of the company, which was not identified, last week."
"Before you get too happy betting on the rise of AAL, remember the CEO sold his shares on April 25th for 10.31, so that's what you should inform your valuation."
"Like what I expected .. Raises the price to the highest ... Then the price comes down to suit him ... People covet and start selling to them, hoping to rise to the previous price ... very smart.."
Welcome to the quarterly conference call Parker sell off.
"Looks like a tricky psychological game with the virus setting up for Monday. The media isn't quite getting it yet (wait a few hours, hopefully with some public analysis from Fauci), but there's evidence today is suggesting there's a fair amount of coronavirus floating around the USA. Like it appears to have hit a nursing home in Washington State. The deal is, as Fauci previously suggested, is the the virus behaves like the flu. Most people who get it don't get very sick and don't seek medical attention. But when you get to a high risk group -- basically, the elderly -- they get sick and can die.So where does this leave AAL? Obviously, it won't be the end of the world, and travel won't be disrupted forever, but is Monday the day to buy, or is there a bit more panic ahead? I don't know yet.____________________________________The virus may have been in Washington State for weeks.As Washington State declared a state of emergency over the new coronavirus, researchers who studied two cases in the state say that the virus may have been spreading there for weeks, suggesting the possibility that up to 1,500 people in the state may have been infected.* * * *In Washington State, researchers compared two cases in the hopes of gaining such insight. One case, which last month became the first in the United States, appeared in a patient from whom health officials took a sample on Jan. 19. Another case that surfaced in the region last week probably descended from it, based on an analysis of the virus’s genetic sequence.The findings suggest that the virus has been spreading in the community for close to six weeks, according to one of the scientists who compared the sequences, Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the University of Washington.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/w...irus-news.html"
"Airlines are Green, except...."
So far I am liking TD Ameritrade. I lost all confidence in Robinhood and closed my account.
"Focus of the airlines on cargo revenues also boosted the top lines of most carriers in the March quarter. Evidently, cargo revenues surged at American Airlines in excess of 100%."
"I’d like to say, “Just heads up, folks!”Remember AAL’s share price trading on market sentiment. If market does retreats, so will the share price of AAL. There are signs of bubble growing in the market. I have spent hours to find decent premium with low risk stocks. Hardly any stock looked at it across various sectors caught my attention. Premiums are dropping sharply while share prices are rising greatly without any real support fundamentally, at least, not reasonably that I could say. This situation worries me. I think the FAT MAN is assembling a devious plan at the moment. Remember, I said the tax-filing month is approaching. They will dump the overpriced stocks on the SKINNY MAN. If you’ve bought calls, they’re on high premiums, but if you have written puts, they are on low premium. When the dumping starts, if you’re long, you lose. You’re bearish and received premiums you believe it was decent, you’ll own the shares at a high cost. Just be weary of the current market situation."
The good news for longs is AAL might be building support at $16/share - $17/share.
"Dow is down 456 points and AAL is standing Tall.Investors have dealt with current situation as another Ebola or BRExit, been there done that and No Problems!"
"7-day moving average for the PAX has been rising straightly for 18 days in a row to 1,574,147, the PAX on Thursday was the highest ever since pandemic, the Friday's was the Highest as well as yesterday's for the Fridays and Saturdays since Pandemic. First 15 days of May the total PAX was 64.08% of 2019, the quarter so far was 60.9% of 2019. We're NOT even in June Yet."
"Cash Burn: I had guesstimated about $50 million per day. As Delta stated $60 million, this seems to be confirmed.Just with the $2.7 billion obtained the other day that is 54 days for AAL.Add $12 billion adds another 240 days to 294 days, 10 months and that doesn't even consider what they had available previously or that that they could reduce the cash burn.No rational worry for bk at this point."
"There is One BIG Surprise, ONE from AAL!AAL bought 637,201 shares at avg $43.15 in April and 7,537,806 at avg $42.79 in May, with $1.650m left at the end of May.Guess What?They did NOT buyback a single share in June; NONE!"

I still say $10 today and possibly $11 tomorrow. The big boys are going to try to push this higher... there’s a huge option activity with the $11 strike. If you are short you can still cover and go long. I see AAL at $16 to $18 soon as demand picks up.
love to see the longs burn. sell sell sell

Everyone is reporting record summer travel ahead. So what do we get? Lower prices?? Best contrarian scenario I have seen in a while. Stocking up at these silly prices.
"Parker seems incapable of juggling the critical aspects of American's key drivers. With margins much lower than they were a couple of years ago, how will he attack or has attacked the sector's largest debt load, especially as rates trend upward and he will eventually need to refinance some of these loans? The fact that he doesn't even address debt for me implies this is a big problem and when you add their very high payroll and benefits numbers, the possibility of seeing eye catching margin enhancements is next to none for the time being. Several years ago Parker emphasized that he wanted the most fuel efficient fleet that would also be a step above competitors for the travel experience and the very large debt was justified and would basically take care of itself. The man is nowhere to be seen when it comes to discussing whether his strategies have been paying off. From what we see it doesn't look good. I will add that buying back the large number of shares may have actually helped shareholders. Why? Can you imagine the EPS if the original share count, say 5 years back was used to make the calculation but then again the debt would have been lower if they had not bought back so many shares."
"SO THEY HAVE COME UP WITH A NEW WEAPON/EXCUSE CALLED VOLATILITY.UNDER THE PRETEXT OF VOLATILITY, THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING TO OUR STOCKS/OPTIONS/ACCOUNTS , BAR US FROM TRADING, CLOSE THE WHOLE MARKET AND MANIPULATE INTERNALLY, ETC, RAISE YOUR PITCHFORKS EVERYONE.$GME $AMC $NAKD $BB $BBYL $AAL $KOSS $EXPR"
shorting should be illegal bc its for really insider trading and viokates market principles bc there more selling with shares not exist
"Why not raise the Dividend? The current yield adds no real relevance, especially considering where treasury yields are now. And the more shares Parker buys back, the cheaper the dividend gets to pay. There is more than one way to return cash to shareholders, and a dividend can help put a floor on the price by enticing yield buyers. But not at 0.90%..."
"Since I worry about everything with this stock (I think you guys now fully understand why!), the thing I'm worried about tonight is that the USA is about to very aggressively test sick people for coronavirus. As I understand it, testing increased this weekend, but not that aggressively. Now we're supposedly going to get thousands of new lab tests in the next few days. I'm certain those test results will show lots more new infections. Playing psychologist, I think we have to get past that bump before most people believe the worst is over."

Does AAL still and continue to pay a divvy? New to this board and thinking bout buying
"This POS is behaving lately like it may still get to $47 - $52 by end of year. I will take it. My buy-in thesis was always been the end of major capex or slowdown thereof and the payoff from the merger finally showing some synergies. $1 billion left on buybacks, so when that is exhausted by the 4th Q perhaps, they can then concentrate on debt repayment and that is a very very good thing. The market should sniff this out by the end of 3rd Q and that will result in meaningful gain in the pps."
"I presume traders will again think that ""China trade tensions"" somehow signal the end of the world for AAL shareholders. But we now have confirmation from Derek Kerr that business at AAL is great. ""Tensions"" mean more profit for AAL through lower fuel cost. I suspect some geniuses will figure this out, probably sooner than later. It's just not sustainable for this stock to trade at a 4 p/e under these circumstances. AAL is undervalued by 50% compared to the rest of the S&P 500."

"I came across a YouTube video last month which explained how some CEOs made some really big bad business decisions in the past. As a result, those businesses were obliterated while the ones they wanted to acquired at one time flourished. They became some of the best companies in S&P 500 today.Sometimes, simple business decisions that normally would have been taken by any ordinary small business owners are also the best business decisions for large multinational companies. The common sense in AA operation is that the top line company leaders should have focused on debt reduction a long time ago. I commented on the importance of this matter months ago that having high debt is worrisome for multinational companies that are in need of big money investors especially if these companies require a lot of investment to survive in the sector during high volatile market environment fueled with so many risks. This is the case on the part of AA. The management has failed the investors. When you look at some of the financially stronger companies, you observe they are more resilient against share price volatility. I worked for one of the largest multinational companies for years prior to equity trading. I remember vividly we had a meeting and the company wanted to sign a deal with the local branch Teamster union which represented a small number of employees that were employed at the time. This was right after the Great Recession, 2009-2010. We were the largest branch with the highest potential in the U.S. Without these employees the branch wouldn't simply make any money and lose tremendous amount of revenues. The CEO got onto plane from the head quarter and came to spend two weeks with us in the area trying to resolve the issue. He wasn't alone so there were the cost of his travel (hotel, rental car, and what have you). They insisted not to give any increase which was actually an insignificant amount. I don't know if they never do the math. I waited for him to finish his speech and the end of the Q&A period. After that, I requested if I could talk. I have built trust with these employees and they knew I would make the best argument and protect their interest as well as the interest of the company. I didn't do anything extraordinary. All I said was that his two weeks travel expenses was almost as equal as the cost that would occur from any wage increase. The three top level managers and including the branch managers and mid managers looked at me in a confused manner. The CEO asked me how I came up with that amount. This time, I was perplexed to the fact that they obviously never run some numbers. I provided them some historical figures on wage increase, loss of income for the employees due to the Great Recession versus the price hike for the products that company has sold. Not raising wages slightly rather than giving nothing would destroy employee confidence, trust in the management, and employee performance. An hour later, the deal was signed after CEO has spent two weeks without achieving anything while ignoring his own obligations in the headquarter."

It’s going now but wait in a week. You had wished you held on. It will start moving higher as Earnings end of January. Expect another beat.

time to buy now that robinhood will be back online?
"AAL is trading in a narrowing short/medium term channel, if you look at support from aug and oct lows and resistance from july and oct/nov highs. Low end of channel right now is 26.70 and high end is 30.16. If you believe in the value floor in general I think you bet on the upside as this channel continues to narrow. Of course the support is only $1 away on the downside...."

Time to open a short position. Very overbought for a company that has been losing money and increasing they debt for a year. Good stock for a short term play but getting in now is a horrible idea.Next week the Nasdaq correction will be over and money will be going back to companies that actually make money and have high profit margins.

"Parker wants to turn AAL into Sprint by being cheap, the new MAX will seat 172 passengers with tiny lavatories people couldn't even turn easily. It makes the FA cry mummy when it comes to cleaning. This Project Oasis is to maximize the profit with 30-inch seat. Most AAL's customers only fly AA once in a while, they just want cheap tickets/seats and Parker will give them just that."
"Ok so here is the deal. AAL was sold off when analysts and pundits started TALKING about the affect of higher oil prices on margins. Oil was $10 higher than it is now before any of that ""talking"" really started happening. Last time oil was $53, AAL was in the low $50s. I'm not saying that we are headed back to the low $50s only because of where oil is now, but rather that at some point, analysts and pundits are going to have to start talking about lower oil. As long as we don't see instant capacity increases (which we won't, remember there was a lag after the 2014 oil plummet before capacity became an issue), that talking will prop the price of AAL back up. I like oil in the 50s, but if we head ot the 40s or lower I'll be looking for a chance to sell AAL on strength, only because we all know capacity WILL become an issue, and oil that low also portends some macro economic woes. So basically, I'm rooting for oil to STOP going down now."
Breaking News: Buffett confesses he was WRONG about Airlines. Business changed in a “very major way”. Industry has to pay back $Billions. Future much less clear. Looks like he’s out of everything.

$13.5 after hours
Doesn't AAL have about the highest debt of the major airlines?
"I'm out at 13.58. It may prove to be a big mistake, but I'm having trouble seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. No doubt airlines will survive but I have my doubts about equity. I'm going to look at buying some higher quality names that will certainly survive, like Starbucks. And I'll be buying gradually. This pandemic is only just starting. GLTA, I'll check back in, but may not be able to stomach it if the PPS goes up."
"AAL down 40% from feb levels... weakness in travel will not stay into perpetuity. Even if there’s a long term negative outlook, I don’t see it 40% worse than what it used to be pre covid. Recovery still not fully priced."
Not bad earnings... Anyone knows what specifically that tax credit was from??

"""In April we introduced the “Forgiveness Ratio,” which measures the market’s willingness to overlook downward EPS revisions, at least to some degree. The forgiveness ratio is calculated by subtracting the change in EPS revisions from in the move in the stock price. So, for example, if consensus EPS moves down 20% but the stock goes down by just 15% over that same period, that’s a +5pp “forgiveness” ratio. The idea: higher quality airlines are “forgiven” more often as issues driving EPS cuts – whether the fault of the airline or not – are viewed to be fixable or transient due to a track record of strong results. We talked about this before, but we update it today (7/20/18) because it feels relevant as ‘quality’ airlines are relatively out of favor this year. ""- King FIshForgiveness Ratio? Ha, Ha!"
Current thing to know.. Fake news is rampant in this country.. Do the opposite of what the news says
Let’s play the excuse game by Doug Parker. It’s a great year round game —good every year fun for the whole family.Oil prices are killing us (ok not so much as they’ve collapsed).The weather is awful (you’re in a million cities...not awful everywhere..duh).Economic headwinds (10 year long recovery 3% GDP)Highly competitive environment (UAL & Delta killing it)We gave mid contract raises cuz...we’ll they deserve it (how sweet)The stock price should be much higher! (Even though we haven’t come close to matching our stated 3-5-7 pre tax earnings target DESPITE cheap oil AND full planes).What a tool!
AAL IS A RECOVERY PLAY. IT IS ALSO HIGHLY SHORTED! AIRLINES ARE ONE OF THE BIG RECOVERY STOCKS THAT HAVE NOT YET GOT BACK TO HIGHS OR BEW HIGHS. BUY NOW BEFORE THE SKIES ARE FULL!
Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your seat belts we are about to be taking off soon to be in he mid twenties where there maybe a little turbulence but please be confident we are making it to the moon.

The coronavirus opens up the discussion just how many viruses are spread from traveling whether it be a cold or something more serous and how quick it can be spread. It will take years to get travelers flying at the same rate pre-coronavirus.
"Yesterday Market was down and some analysts were bearish on the recovery. Today morning it was up and different sets of analysts were bullish . If you notice all stocks were up premarket , in fact even before 7am trading. Hedge funds are planning to exit on Monday and bearish sentiments will kick in. It going down to $12 atleast by next week Wednesday!!"
Good buying opportunity for $BA $UAL $AAL $CCL.
"It's too early to gather all the related information at the moment but I will invest some time to analyze the direction of the stock and possible developments regarding AAL for the coming weeks and months without weighting the impact of any unusual developments and events that may occur in the market.At this very moment, I'd like to share a few of my observations regarding AAL after a very volatile trading day on the first day following the Q4 results:I mentioned a few times previously that I expected the stock price rise prior to Q4 results. First, there was the killing of iranian general on Jan 03, Friday, that pushed the price downward, and then there was the flue scare this week which caused a similar impact on the share. Let's remember that the buy side has been weak for a long time. As a result, the stock has lost value.I entered today's volume, 25,610k, in my personally developed the Time+Volume Frequency table chart. I use two table charts: the chart 1 to observe the past midterm period (october 2019), and the chart for the past long term (october 2016). Why October? Because I tend to think AAL has probably reversed its long term decline at that time. I have explained it in one of my comments prior to end of the year. Anyway, I compared the volume figure on the net buy/sale table charts. The very similar volume number appears in Jan 17th, Dec 24, Oct 31st. The closing price and/or the day's low are very similar in the first two while the October is not far off. Considering the events that occurred around those dates, it's important to understand and interpret the meaning of these similarities carefully. In the situation of Dec. period, AAL shares lost value in a very good year with high market returns, so we can assume that investors have chosen to sell the stock to avoid excessive tax payments before the year end. In the case of January while the market was already higher than the October period, the loss in share price value was due to the Iran crises and upcoming the Q4 report with many unknowns. Otherwise, the figures in last two periods would have been very similar to the October period which was slightly higher. When I look at the long term table chart, those dates provide same result and in addition, I notice the same volume appeared on Sept 12th and way back in January 03, 2019 for the first time. The result is very similar. Before that, the volume buy/sell figures are quite different because of the sale frenzy and constant decline in stock value. In my opinion, this is quite interesting. Every day millions of AAL stocks are bought and sold in different prices and quantities. Each time, this buy/sell volume figure appears similar, the price is similar. The length in terms of trading days between these periods are different. I haven't checked every single numerical similarities on the table chart because it is quite a long data but I did pick a few volumes on the table chart, and they are very similar as well. The similar volumes have similar pricing. Why?One more thing, after each of those dates, the stock price went up as well. The trading manner on Thursday supports it as well as long as we are not getting any bad news. I still hold the view that AAL share value is more influenced by the overall market (negative news that are not necessarily about AAL) rather the company's fundamentals.Anyway, I wanted to keep this comment short just to share this data with but while typing the comment, I also got to observe this strange stuff. I need time to go over this data later on.Trade with caution and thanks for reading."
Parker...look what you have done to AAL...reduce it to THE most hated airline in the market for the employees..the traveler and the investor...Proud of yourself??? Because NO ONE else is!
AAL has a great future ...just be patient and this will be at $30
"With new efficient aircraft and a new partnership with our National Parks, it is appropriate that American is reporting first quarter results on Earth Day.

"Until we get some good COVID-19 news, airlines will be under pressure. But when we do, you may not be able to get back in before a several dollar price increase. For those who remain long and optimistic, the rewards should outweigh the short term stress."

"I'm pretty stunned by this move today. It may change my strategy a bit.Tech stocks recovered quick. Many are at or near all time highs. Further growth there is slow and steady. So many opportunities elsewhere. Market didn't move too much either way today, but airlines kicked it. We may have more days of movement between sectors. Get in on it. This sudden crash/sudden recovery is a once in a lifetime event. Still a ton of upside in many affected sectors. Airlines, hotels, gaming, cruises... load up everywhere!"

"AAL is caught between a rock and a hard place and all the BS related to analyst upgrades, potential credit card revenue, new and efficient planes, experienced employees and ludicrous analyst pps projections last year(50s, 60s and even 80s, will not overcome very high jet fuel costs, high union labor, an enormous debt and competition from all sides and for all routes both domestically and internationally. Parker is certainly one of the most experienced airline CEOs but I feel circumstances and certainly some of his misguided decisions, especially the huge debt and kissing up to labor, will for some time create shareholder angst."
"Stock wants to go up today. It will downtick when oil spikes but recover then go up more when oil retreats. So far oil is up 1.1% and aal is up 1.9%. Oil is a factor here but there is more that is driving airlines than the cost of oil. It is certainly adding to the volatility, but pricing power will end up being the real driver. If the airline model truly is changed as Parker and others have been saying for years, the cost of oil should be irrelevant to the long term business model."
hah get rekt bagholders! prepare for bankruptcy!

"I am wondering if air traffic will recover faster than expected. The average age of mortality for covid is above 80 (with most having co-morbidity factors).

"I am nearly 100% certain that the current market conditions are setting up to make AAL investors a ton of money. Probably the best money-making opportunity since the stock fell to the high $20s a couple summers ago. The problem is, as always, timing. I am expecting (hoping?) for more oil downside, which will make the AAL bounceback even stronger."
"The test is coming for you guys. I would not want to be long stock here with virus cases surging.Plenty of room to hop on when the sentiment changes but buying here... you are straight-up crack-head gambling.The airlines will most likely retest lows, and quite possibly fail the test...Good luck..."

"After 6 Quarters of declining valuation, Parker continues to erode AAL as an investment. The share price hovers at AAL' merger price 6 years ago, returning a 0% gain in long-term investment, halving the company' valuation and doubling its debt. There has been no debt reduction, no dividend increase, and profits have dropped.Parker's strategies have been dismal:1/- He has bought a lot of fuel efficient (15%) planes that don't appear to show any financial benefit.2/- AAL' buyback program has underperformed with an average buyback in the mid $40s.3/- His much promised goal of pre-tax earnings in the range of $(3-5-7)B has quietly become $(1-2-3)B. 4/- He has increased employee pay and added profit-sharing at a huge cost to AAL' profit; and I suspect the employees will be the first to throw him under the bus.5/- His Basic Economy seating was supposed to create $1B in annual earnings, that doesn't look like it actualized.6/- New routes in AAL' hubs have just started in DFW and are supposed to create $1B in annual earnings, no real results yet but (given Parker' goal achievement rate) probably going to underperform.The BOD should be looking for a new CEO, I wonder if Kirby would come back?"
"UAL shows the damage done....and the damage to continue. Clearly, this is a multi year recovery, if at all. Biz travel has evaporated and not likely to return to pre Covid levels any time soon. Rising fuel prices is just an additional kick in the groin."
"In the meanwhile, WTI has been tracking up and down with Dow Jokes, and OPEC's production has been sliding more than USA Production has been adding, what a weird market.The market is trying very hard for people to get their money locked in during earnings season, hopefully the government will reopen by Early February before Credit agencies downgrading USA's debts?We go negative GDP growth if Trump keeps the government shutdown for the whole quarter?"
"Gentlemen’s After being battered throughout 2020 due to the coronavirus-induced declining passenger revenues, U.S. airlines have been benefiting from the improvement in air-travel demand (particularly on the leisure front) this year. The betterment was well-reflected in the first-quarter 2021 results of most airline players. While earnings announcement is over for almost all U.S.-based airline stocks. The brightening scenario is reflected in the price movement of airline heavyweights during the three-month period (January-March), which is included in the first-quarter results. Notably, shares of Delta Air Lines DAL, United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL, Southwest Airlines LUV and Alaska Air Group ALK gained 20%,33%, 51.5%, 31% and 33.1%, respectively, in the above period, well above the S& P 500’s 6.3% appreciation in the same time frame."
Lol I really do enjoy reading the comment battles between bulls and bears.
"So my long haul flights on AA have been at or near 100% capacity this month, but now I'm getting notifications that my short haul flights are busy, too (if there are any alternatives, AAL sends you an email and offers you a change if you want one -- the changes are usually not feasible, though). We'll have to see how close enplanements get to 900,000 this weekend. Without the confidential booking info, it's hard for me to measure increased demand from lower COVID v. seasonality (the busy summer travel season is ending)."
aal isn't going out of business. once traveling let's back up it will have a hell of a jump up. just be patient.
Bad day for the market overall. This will bounce back for sure. Still great stock for the future of travel and going back to our new normalcy
Gov won't allow AAL to go bankrupt during an election year. The Dollar isn't backed by Gold so Fed can keep printing and lending without consequence. AAL bankruptcy would be a huge headache for Gov as all those fired employees/voters line up for federal help. Easy path out is to lend to AAL.
The gap with DAL is now $22 per share and a whopping $23B. That is not a misprint! The market says DAL is now worth $23 billion more than AAL! WOW!
"So I fly around a lot. Lots of airlines and airports. I'm in FLL this week. Fascinating situation there. Over the last 30 years, I've seen it grow from a small airport into a major airport. It's bursting at the seems at the moment. I guess it's spring break and such, but I've never seen that airport more crowded -- even at Christmastime. South Florida's tourist economy is obviously booming. In other words, this is a very good business to be in. Probably not so much at FLL, though. Between JBLU and SAVE (especially), FLL attracts a relatively downmarket clientele. Folks who aren't spending the big bucks. Different from MIA, which is also very busy and has a fair amount of ""friends and family"" travel, but also has high end travel (AAL has premium cabin service that commands real dinero, especially to Latin America). MIA hasn't been a great performer for AAL the past couple of years, due to weaknesses in some major Latin American countries. But it's bouncing back. And between domestic tourism to MIA, Latin tourism, and other foreign travel (MIA is now hot in Asia), I know that AAL's MIA hub is good for a couple hundred million in extra annual profits the next couple of years. It's a no brainer. That's pretty good growth. And nobody on Wall Street seems to understand this whatsoever."
Love to see a Major Short Squeeze
"It's official....the Mickey Mouse Meat Company (TTM revenue $240m) is now worth more than ""the worlds biggest airline"".....Parker should be proud of this achievement "
4% drop incoming <3
"LUV is posting some pretty bad numbers today. CASM up 10%. Rev up 3% max. Big hit due to MAX groundings. Gonna hurt. IMO AAL won't see much (if any) improvement until 2020 when Parker swears cashflow with increase. Will it? Who knows. If you are unwilling to wait on it, sell now and get out. I bought this for a quick trade, honestly never expected it to end up down 10% after six months..."
"Odd that shorts are piling into AAL despite it having one of the strongest earning yields in the S&P 500. It does have a substantial amount of debt though this is mitigated by a very large cash position and a debt maturity schedule that is very manageable. The debt is also mostly low, fixed rates (around 4%). Earnings per share are up this year over last and they are expected to rise again next year. I don't really get the bear case.Not_A_Short"
Confirmed: Berkshire sold all of its airline holdings.
"BlackRock added 2,420,645 shares of AAL, the filing shows."
Does anybody here still harbor the illusion that air travel is coming back like gangbusters? Wake up! This weekend it was less than 13% of what it was this time last year. How profitable are airlines going to be flying at 13% of capacity?https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
"Of course its a dream scenario, but with 2019 being the last 5b capex year, capex dropping to annual amount of 2-3b after 2019, I could see a scenario if pps does not move up significantly , market cap stays at 20b or less ,of aal being a buyout target. I think one of big roadblocks is the constant wage pressure from their labor unions. Not an attractive issue for any potential buyer. I will be surprised if HA and JBLU are not buyout targets in near future. Both have low market caps and solid BSs and have sold well off from their highs. Buffet best bet for aal buyout if he likes shiny new planes, alot of cheap debt and greedy unions. The current market cap for all is chump change especially since already owns almost 10%, just depends on whether he is ok with the 24b in debt...fwiw"

Bought 1000 shares of AAL yesterday because of GME. Helping the movement. but noticed AAL not a bad company to invest in for the long run. putting it away unless runs to $500 than I'll sell some :)
AAL launched from $28 pps after Ebola scare n 2916... Here we are again.. rocketed to 59 pps at that time...
52 weeks high 4sure...
"American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, 0.00% disclosed last week that it expected to receive $5.8 billion as part of the PSP under the CARES Act, which would require the airline to issue warrants allowing the Treasury Department to buy 13.7 million shares at a strike price of $12.51.That would give the government a 3.2% stake in American, enough to be the sixth-largest shareholder. Buffett owned 42.5 million shares as of Feb. 14, making him the airline’s second-largest shareholder with a 9.7% stake."
Ok - expect another 4% increase today.
More government bailout of airlines. This just saved AAL from bankruptcy. Up big Monday.
"With the market cap of $20 billion, If oil levels out and ticket prices remain firm, AAL can buy back a meaningful quantity of shares, quickly. Warren Buffet did not sell any shares in his Q1 13F filing."
"This is astonishing to see shorts paid spammers to take down AAL they haven't learned anything from GameStop, Express, blackberry, BBB, AMC"
"The moment airlines will get more money from usa, the stock will rocket up"
"So this story seems odd and interesting to me: AAL just announced that they're hiring 400 more workers at their main Tulsa maintenance base. I'm sure this isn't random, and must have something to do with dealing with the mechanics unions. Does anyone know? This is well beyond the pay grade of the mainstream media.https://www.tulsaworld.com/business/american-airlines-adding-jobs-in-tulsa/article_beaad2af-89c9-55e2-a242-85d5dfc997d0.html"
looks like it ready for a crash landing it will be 22 by the end of the day!!!!!! you should have sold at 25.90
Can anyone tell me analysts price target on AAL. I’ve been holding since 33. Wondering if I should sale
I will state it again. I should have bought more.
AAL going to $27 by Monday! Robin Hooders can buy now. #SAVEAMERICABUYINGAMERICAN
already industry is down.why these guys predicts the future and says about the bankruptcy..this is just to create a panic in the individual investors.
"I wonder if AA or even any of the airline industry will ever come back again soon. As if a 2nd wave is hit, it will decimate many. Too big to fail? hmm.. prices are 60-70 off from good times.. a good buy? who knows.."
Y’all better load up if y’all have the funds!
"To me the bottom line is that people just have to fly on planes to get around. It can be business, vacation, etc. Yes, it it went down alot from Corona. But IN TIME when things improve, which they will, you don't think people will ever fly again? Never a trip out of the country, Hawaii, NY to California?? it has to eventually get back to normal. Flying is a a must to millions. Even if it takes weeks, months or even a year....it will get back to normal and so will the stock prices."
"We got CPI and we wait for PPI, but VIX has not really Peaked yet...That's what Uncle is thinking... May is the month lots of people are making wild decision, Uncle talked about it and ""prepared"" for it towrd end of April and first week of May. Uncle watches what the heck will people act on PPI...Uncle does NOT Short stocks."
"Buying 5m shares of AAL @39.45 and 111,111 Oct 39 puts Yesterday has $988.9k profit so far."
Reduced number of flights and passengers equals negative revenue
is it breakout time for aal? it's right about at that price.. from 22 to 27-30 from here?
Until which price will you guys hold? My average price is 12.8. Would like to hold until 30. do you think it will happen this year?
"Uncle continues to see demand being strong on Airline bookings, passengers traveling, but the crazy people kept asking/talking about all the non-existing things that might hurt the Airlines. The weirdest thing is the Street/Media won't even listen to the company insiders. Very Sad situation...https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/united-airlines-ceo-facts-show-talk-of-recession-is-way-overblown.html"
"Headed back to the USA with AAL on the move. Seems mostly technical to me. Only real positive fundamental news is that AAL has shown they can make lots of money even when they're experiencing a lot of bad luck. The theory would be that if their luck changes, they're going to generate tons of free cash flow next year."
• NEWSAirline Stocks Fall As Industry Seen Not Getting Back To Normal Before 2023
"American Airlines and Carnival Cruise lines are both dropping to below $14, they will report their worst annual loss in decades amongst the traveling restrictions being put into affect, be careful, sell now and buy later when it’s at its cheapest."
Sale of stock coming today or tomorrow
"Not sure what's going on today, but the Argus US Jet fuel index on the Airlines for America website showed an enormous drop in the blended US jet fuel price yesterday. It closed at $1.70 gallon. This was above $2.40 in October. I assume that it's this number that gets you closest to the real input costs for the US airlines."
"We have so many vaccines and now even people have option to choose which company vaccines to take, JnJ is halted, so what? Pfizer and Moderna are the major contributor to the overall vaccine distribution anyway."
C'MON baby... you can do it... another 3% increase... lets goooo
Airlines and travel stocks will go up when people realize out government is a fraud. 98.xxx% of people contract it and it's no more then a cold. Get on with your lives.
"I think this is setting up for another short squeeze tomorrow, just like the one driven by Reddit 3 weeks ago, only this one will be more devastating to the shorts. I just get that gut feeling reading little bits on different boards and looking at the headlines trying to steer/scare people away from participating in it. The say, hold your $AAL stock and you will do very well, very soon! "
This share will announce a loss of approximately $ 19 for the year 2020 .... Do you think it will go up tomorrow ....
this stock went from 50 billion to 95 billion market cap in less than a month! 
Financial elites have already decided that AAL must go bankrupt.
"go AA go up up and away,....."
"777X maiden flight, definitely a game changer!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rNyJbdv2KF4"
"IMHO and based on pre covid charts, it looks to me like AAL heading for 25-28$ over the next 30 days. What do you think?"
yahoo....control the spam....
"Another great day - TSA report:3/20/2021 1,369,180"
"The pre covid-19 10 day average TSA travel numbers from 03/02-03/011 @ 1,752,551. The 10 day average hit its lowest point 04/11-04/20 @ 96,809. The 05/11-05/20 10 day average has since increased to 192,271. While these numbers are still down significantly from pre covid-19 numbers it definately shows an increasing trend, i.e. many people are willing and want to fly. I feel its gonna take a while but believe AAL, JBLU, & DAL will recover... just gonna have to be patient, have a cast iron stomach and not watch it every day... :-)"
"Looking to get in to AAL, price sure seems to be a great entry however what the future looks like might see a lower number. Pure speculation but a $12.16 number looks promising. 15% further slide? Way to much unknown today to get in but starting to look hard."
Buffet dumped for a reason. Why? To save them? Or to protect his shareholders? You do the math.
"TSA screened 1.5 million passengers yesterday vs. 104 thousand passengers a year ago. A fourteen fold increase in passengers at this stage of the pandemic should help convince you that the full recovery in the travel industry is on track. If you are thinking six months ahead, like the stock market is supposed to, you should be invested."
"Uncle revised AAL's earnings to $11,950m revenue and $1.83 EPS, vs Street's $11,980m and $1.69, using midpoint of AAL's new guidance.In summary: ASM was revised down 1.5%, CASM-ex revised Up 0.5%, Fuel was only 2c/gal lower, but Pre-Tax margin revised Up 1%."
AAL next GameStop
"Liked it at 15, love it at 11!"
Bad time for earnings. No gains holding across the market on earnings. Everyone gets shafted these days. Don't forget to take profits if ya can. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
$27.2 please? Thank you!
"JOB CUTS ... CHICAGO, July 15 (Reuters) - American Airlines is sending 25,000 notices of potential furloughs to frontline workers, according to a memo released on Wednesday, preparing employees for job cuts in the fall as the coronavirus pandemic forces airlines globally to shrink."
Airlines have direct control over capacity and fares. Reduce the former and raise the latter. Simple.
Next week going to fun
"If this passes 26 today, I'll change my orientation"
AAL will be a twenty dollar stock by mid June.
Checkpoint numbers steadily heading back. Still a long way off but firm trend in the right direction. We'll see over 600 to 700K next week.https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput
"I suppose it doesn't matter much in the short term, but has anyone been paying attention to AAL "" the business""? They seem to have a decent plan here. They're placing negative margin flying with positive margin flying. If what they say about the math is correct, this is going to be quite good for profitability in the next year."
We should see 24 or nothing
"Short interest: AAL 6.99%, ual 4.95, luv 2.41, dal 2.11. Oil down 3.10, shorts still in control. At some point they will have to get squeezed. Is this oil move for real? Seems like it. Iran is baked in, Libya online, opec and Russia seem willing to incr supply, and USA continues to build pipelines from Permian. Should be an interesting couple months. Not yet sure why AAL has been the only short target but it’s overdone. Sometimes I think the stock market is like a chicken coop, the weakest get picked on and that’s just the way it is"
"I find this hilarious. I wish I had a dollar for every airline that has gone under in the last 40 years. Like all of you WB drank the kool aid, and then came back to reality and sold his positions. AA is nothing more than a leasing operation, like a Hertz, except with much added risk. GE sold off their rail car leasing business (the largest in the world)."
"We maintain our 12-month target price of $70. AAL announces that it expects fourth quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to rise 5.0%-6.0% versus prior guidance of up 2.5%-4.5%. It also sees its Q4 pretax margin at 6.5%-7.0% vs. prior 4.5%-6.5% guidance. We think industry momentum on unit revenues is accelerating, and see AAL as a major beneficiary of this trend. We expect AAL to outperform the industry average on unit revenues over the next year, while at the same time we see most U.S. airlines seeing moderate to strong unit revenue growth in 2018. WOW, from your lips to Gods ears, a PPS price target of $70.00 certainly works for me"
"the stock is showing you where its gonna go , we saw over pre trading it breached 30 , it will be there in a few weeks"
I read to JPMorgan that they will start pouring $ 400 billion into shares this month. I don't think the government will let an airline like AAL go bankrupt. It's just out of the question. This is a different crisis than the previous ones. This is a virus just because it costs everything. When travel starts - the action will fly up.
"I have a couple of hundred shares of AAL, even the price is doubled I will not earn a lot. But I will hold my shares just to support our airlines!!! If the economy recovers from Covid-19, that will benefit our common people. Of course those hedge funds have different thoughts."
More low volume manipulation at play. One good news catalyst will send this up $2.00+ can’t wait to hit the hedge funds where it hurts.
Unions THRILLED to have locked in huge pay hikes as the yield curve signals recession and economies worldwide slow..
"There's what I called ""Breaking Rumor"" on LUV's takeover again around 10:41 ET, and it Lifted airline stocks!"
if there is a major squeeze AA will shoot past $30
"An issue here is: unstable geopolitical, labor tension, bad storms somewhere, volatile energy prices— are ALL NORMAL.Parker treats these as “one-offs” creating continual disappointment EACH year when it comes to even approaching his $3bil bad year-$5bil normal year-$7billion great year” plan.So...here’s how Parker’s plan WORKS: if Oil is fixed at $50, the world is prosperous and at peace, climate change means the permanent end of storms, And Pilots, flight attendants, and mechanics all join in one big happy kumbaya song chanting their universal pleasure with pay, benefits, and working conditions.That is Parker’s 3-5-7 world. It hasn’t happened. Yet. But will perhaps some day.So each quarter Parker outlines which combination of the above stood in the way of his “plan”. The excuses vary but occur every year. It’s normal."
Robinhood is trying to depress sentiment for the cause. Their 2nd in command is a hedge fund crony. This 100% orchestrated
PArker MOngo Greg
$AAL is in a great position right now. They have had the most passengers this past quarter and they’ve improved their customer service score.They’re doing more to improve their brand.
"Dear Doug Parker,#$%$ you and AAI strongly disagree with your statements concerning the Georgia Election Reform Bill. You have used your position at American as a pulpit to misrepresent this important legislation.You have attempted to magnify your opinion using the wealth and clout of your publicly traded company American Airlines.Worst of all you have clouded the issue with racially charged statements that impugn the personal integrity of elected Georgia officials. You have created racial conflict, divided the people of this nation and you have chosen sides."
"Parker, read this:Barrons feature on Delta: USA’s best run airline.Please, Dougy, read this. Please!"
"Dead Fish are stuck in Conundrum (well they cited AAL is in Conundrum) situation on AAL, even after company reported Stronger Bookings and Traffic trends. Seaport Global still likes AAL as a recovery story.Their Main argument is AAL has gone ahead of its peers too much (52.57%) too Fast.Well, besides SAVE (+56.99%) and HA (+52.77%), JBLU (+46.15%), ALK (+41.81%), UAL (+37.52%), LUV (+37.52%) and DAL (+28.45%) are all up a lot as well.None of them talked about how much they've been punished since Pandemic started, they don't talk about Airlines' Costs will be lower after they got off extra workforce and older planes.Are Dead Fish paid big bucks for being in Conundrum? What do they leave the investor think what they're for? Uncle says get a better picture of 2022 when the domestic traveling is much higher than 2019, and the International will go like crazy like there's no tomorrow in 2023. Model that!"
The damages case against Robinhood and other brokerages should be substantial. Hopefully AAL and others file lawsuits as well.
American Airlines is down 6.26% to 20.20
What is Uncle Buffett going to say on Uncle’s Thursday?
"Kirby should talk about Post Labor Day domestic capacity trimming, not just the Market Natural Force as strategy for pushing Airfare higher. What if the Economy slows down in 2H?"
I think we will have a continued sell of into the $32-$35 range over the next few weeks unless delta says something really surprising for their traffic report. I think then it will be a screaming buy
"Think ""Market Natural Force"" and think Hard; don't care much about the market manipulation!I mean ""Feel"" and ""Think""."
30$ is around the cornor
this should be above 21$ by now... what's going on?
"Parker is going to lose his bottle of wine bet that AAL would hit $60 by year end but he has only lost chump change compared to what investors have lost. It seems with AAL the analysts are only correct when they give it a sell rating and whenever I hear one of the CNBC hosts giving AAL a buy I can only laugh since it is so short lived. The power players in the stock market appear to have lost interest in the airlines except for maybe UAL and isn't that ironic Mr. Parker? Also, please go back a couple of years and let Qatar buy that 10% stake they wanted and what might have helped shareholders see a sustained $60 plus share price instead of this low thirties action of late. What could have been would have been better than what is!"

The last bounce in oil did not keep us from seeing $40 last week and I’m guessing will close today in the green with a $0.16 maybe even up to... $0.25 gain for the day..
Tomorrow we gonna see $26

"Texas and many other states have been paralyzed for days by this massive winter storm. In Texas millions have been without power for days. Many others have no water or have experienced pipes bursting and flooding parts of their homes. Many restaurants and even grocery stores have closed down because of lack of water (can’t wash dishes, offer restrooms, etc). Many counties are telling people lucky enough to have water that it has to be boiled before drinking, brushing teeth etc DFW area will finally be above freezing this weekend but there are still so many broken water mains that it will take quite awhile to restore services. Two main points I wish to make out of all this chaos. First, it will be interesting to watch the infection rate, as travel, going to restaurants, etc has been almost at a standstill for several days (almost like a quarantine). Second, people are going stir crazy from being home bound. I expect air travel to pick up as many of these same people start to finally get out again."

the breakout number was 37.30. now it is 38.15...….women like my breakout number of 7.9!!!!!! yeah baby
Southwest and United allowing fliers to change their flights to non-MAX planes free of charge will only perpetuate the idea that there is something wrong with the planes.

Totally Waste of Time!"
The fact that AAL is not cutting down seats like other airlines but is taking precautions will help with revenue. AAL will make more revenue than other carriers. AAL will also get help from the goverment. They already have curbed the cash burn. I'm 100% things are improving for sure. There is a lot of upside from here and very low downside. I'm holding my shares!

"parker was asked by Hunter Keay, why not pay the shareholders special divident of $5?. he danced around an answer and then basically said no. could you imagine a $5 / share payout? would take a little of the sting off. from $59 to $27."
"AAL should be fine...just monitor several risk factors:1.) The actual return of 737 MAX.2.) Parker opening up his mouth.3.) Union relations, Mechanics.4.) The weather.As a long Time Industry observer, I can say these are, in order, the issues that warrant attention."
"Two or three years ago, UAL pulled back internationally, reducing ASMs and they said at the time it was their intention to redeploy that capacity domestically, but it wouldn't be for a few years. At the time that's the place they were at in their merger process for whatever reason. Baker referred to that time as UAL not being able to punch their way out of a paper bag. Now UAL is redeploying that capacity and everyone is surprised that they are increasing capacity that they said they were going to do a few years ago. Baker seems to be myopically focused on the extreme short term without looking at what took place over the longer term. AAL was last to merge and is a couple years behind UAL and more versus DAL. Will AAL attain the full value of their initiatives? This year they were suppose to get about $1.5B, but said $200M of that will be pushed to 2019. So, AAL has $2.6B still coming in 2019 and 2020, and getting the $1.5 this year makes the out year initiatives credible. Right now AAL doesn't have all the flexibility they need to perform as UAL and DAL do … those two are through their merger process.A good chunk of the difference in share price between the three can be explain by the eps … and the rest, I guess, depends on where you are in the merger process. AAL is the only one left that is ""show me"", but as of now their is no reason not to believe they too will get their initiatives (plus labor force reduction cost savings)."
"Honest question for the board:Who did more research on the financial solvency of AAL? 1.) Berkshire Hathaway aka Warren Buffett before he unloaded 42 million shares2.) The typical out of work Robinhood investor before they bought 100 shares3.) Travel Guy before he posts ""I work in the travel industry...do your homework""4.) David Calhoun CEO of Boeing before he told a national TV audience a major airline will go BK.I am going with Berkshire first, Boeing second, Robinhood third, Travel Guy last. The reason I put Robinhood ahead of Travel Guy is because at least the Robinhood investor had to login into their account before the trade where Travel Guy just posts."

American airlines is donating food to a Chicago based food kitchen. All of a sudden the greedy airlines are taking the humanitarian approach. Just tells me they are trying really hard for positive PR before earnings. I'm betting their earnings report will be the worst out of all the airlines. Probably to a shocking degree. Need to make themselves look good now to buffer what's about to come.

"Parker renews the debt instead of paying it down..."" New York, January 17, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's) assigned a Ba1 senior secured rating to American Airlines, Inc.'s new $1.215 billion Term Loan B due in January 2027. American Airlines Group Inc. (""Parent"" and, together with American Airlines, Inc. ""American"") will guarantee the new loan. The proceeds will fund the repayment of the company's 2014 Term Loan B due in 2021 and transaction expenses. The Ba3 corporate family rating, which is assigned to the Parent and stable outlook on the family are unaffected by this ratings assignment.RATINGS RATIONALEThe Parent's Ba3 corporate family rating reflects American's scale and competitive position as the world's second largest airline based on revenue, balanced by elevated financial leverage above 5x from a historically aggressive financial policy and an operating margin that continues to trail industry peers. Leverage remains elevated because of the heavy reliance on debt for repurchasing more than $11 billion of its shares while funding the majority of almost $26 billion of capital investment mainly from operating cash flow over the most recent five years. The rating also considers the company's inferior operating margin and weak free cash flow relative to its US legacy airline peers, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. The success of the company's strategy to grow ancillary revenues, increase fees for premium seating and services and more generally, sustain annual operating margin above 11% will be important drivers of expanding free cash flow that exceeds Moody's expectations. Better than expected free cash flow generation would strengthen the positioning of the rating in the Ba3 rating category, particularly if American was to prioritize debt repayment rather than share repurchases with free cash flow when liquidity exceeds its $7 billion target. Management has stated that excess liquidity above $7 billion will be returned to shareholders. """

Compared to Friday, AAL should be up today. Why isn't it?It's technical vulnerability could be exposing it to manipulation. Or, there are pricing and capacity trends that are being observed by sophisticated market participants that are giving them fundamental confidence in selling/shorting."

"OHHHH...the tell will be this afternoon and Monday morning...I suspect it will turn green by end of day. On Monday, I suspect it will be a little volatile on the upside and end at $32.90. If it goes over $33 on Monday, there may be good commentary from the analyst day on Tuesday...I suspect the good commentary will be related to Terminal E. Their commentary may be very positive and will emphasize terminal E as a ""Christmas Gift"" in June because they will confirm 100 more flights than last year from DFW by early June. 100 more flight is a very very big deal! The upside is they may even more positive synergies from this 100 more flights than they have predicted or planned for. I don't see any downside on Terminal E at all. Terminal E is the catalyst for AAL pps to pop up."

I have just read some of the recent post in this board and let me tell you I see the shorts very nervous. Lol  AAL is going much higher.
What caused the large drop today?
"DAL reported NON-GAAP loss of $2.9bn, better than their guidance of ($3bn) recently, the Dead Fish average estimate was too high as Uncle has said earlier. Dead Fish doesn't DO Math, so it's NOT a complete surprise at all. Market reacts as if nobody knew Math as well. Adjusted Revenue of $3.6bn was also higher than $3.5bn, Cash Burn of $11m/day was lower than guided ($12m-$14m)/day guided, this is ALL FACTS.CEO sees ""Pathway to Profitability"" by June (actually Q3) was Good News!Uncle will buy Airlines tomorrow."
Looks like King Fish really kept investors away from the sector...
Very good volume for the share. It seems investors and funds believe in a move at a higher level and they are taking place. Pretty obvious as long as very soon we will have break even.
$35 by March 1st
I have few questions.1. Is vaccine going to make a difference in near future to make air travel better for everyone? As far as I understand it is not going to be available for general public for sometime.2. Isn't AAL must be profitable or have to be profitable in near future to be a good reliable stock? As far as I understand any business must be profitable in order to sustain and may be grow. 3. Is AAL profitable? or when and how its going to be profitable?4. AAL debt as a company?
WB sold some not all people don’t panic. Should not be down 3%
Buffett had to reduce his position in AAL. AAL continues to buy back shares and Warren indicated he will stay below 10% ownership. No other reason he sold the 1.2 M
"Yes Berkshire (Buffet) did sell their stakes in LUV (Southwest) and DAL (Delta), however the company still has stakes in the airlines plus United and American Airlines. We now live in a crazy stock trading time. People are selling (and buying for that matter) because of fear and feelings. If you go back and check out the Dow, Nasdaq, S&P, and some of your favorite stocks, you will see that they tumbled starting in March. Most stocks lost between 35% - 50% of their value (and even more in some cases). However, if you check some of them out today, they are now back to the level where they were or even higher in some cases. And of course, you still see some stocks are still sunk. The ups and down in the range of 5% - 10% is now common, we see that on a daily / weekly basis, but of course, that was not the case in normal times. The lost of the values in March was a result of a ""panic selling"". If you think about it, how can you tell if a stock should be 5% lower, 10% lower, or even 50% lower when the pandemic hit. The answer is, you cannot. Not until you have a set of facts that you can digest and evaluate. So as people saw the mass selling off, they were doing the same. For investors who overcame the panic sell off, the factors that should be considered when buying and selling stocks should be the financial data / performance of a company, the cause of the panic sell off plus the remedy or corrective plan (whether that'd be from the company itself or the Feds / Government in this case), the current situation, near term, mid term, and long term. This type of data is what the financial analysts are using when evaluating and assessing companies / stocks. And with everything we have seen (PPP/CARES Act, cost cutting measures, asset liquidation ability, the progress towards vaccines / medication, and the gradual reopening of states and countries), it does not warrant a downward trajectory for AAL and other airlines for that matter, at least not in a short term. And of course, if we see a decline or an improvement, things can change. This is just my personal opinion. If people review the set of facts and stop oppressing / lowering the price, you will see that the stock will not come down, and it will go up. After all, the basic of demand and supply is what's driving the price (of anything not just stocks). You dont' have to believe or agree with me on the selling because of fear but I would recommend checking out many interesting stocks stories out there. Telsa (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), AMD, Wayfair (W), Snapchat (SNAP), Nike (NKE), Royal Carribian (RCL), Norwegian (NCLH), and many more. Good luck guys :)"
"Like it or not airlines executives would be derelict in their duty shareholders to not seek aid from the government that is ready, willing, and able to provide it. The reduction of the renewed PSP from $25 billion to $20 billion is responsible as air traffic has improved in April.Now some Tuesday morning wide receivers are going to whine, ""what about the dereliction of duty when they purchased shares?"" At that time, the fair judgement was that AAL was undervalued and investing in itself was a good investment for organization.Now you all love to swoon about Delta, but how much money did they lose on LATAM and Virgin Atlantic?Whereas AAL's investment in China Southern is looking mighty good comparatively."
"It's Option Expiration day, AAL is being taken up and down $30 Striking price as Expected.People who are bored can go through each Airlines' SEC filing, lots of funds buying Airlines in 4Q... Only saw one filing of selling tiny stack on UAL.By the way, DAL and ALK filed their 10-K (Annual) Reports Yesterday, DAL showed they've used most of their NOLs, ALK probably will lose all theirs (from VA) due to ownership change. AAL has tons of NOLs and don't have to pay Real Tax for very long time, Uncle loves NOLs, it's AAL's most valuable ""Asset"".DAL's option obligation is down to $5.354bn, 75% funded, ALK's was $363m, 86.05% funded."
"I think that aal wont go down to 8 or 9 because that was during the start of the pandemic (empty planes) and it only gets better from here. so, even with them selling their stock and dilution, I see a base line of around 12-13 and it only go up from there."
"Delta reported traffic and guided EPS at top end of $1.10-$1.30, stock crashed.This is way under Uncle's $1.34/share minimum."
HOOOOLD the BAG! BANKRUPTCY SOON! <3
"This game won't go on forever, institutions that hold stocks like this one are selling at huge profits flooding the market with shares. The word is out after GME and Wall Street is getting prepared. Buyer beware!! Read this article on Yahoo Finance as a perfect example. ""AMC Entertainment to issue 44.4 million shares as investors opt to convert $600 million of convertible debt"""
100 million pounds per week delivered cargo right now. New manager wants to double that in a year. This more than makes up for travel. But even travel is expected to be 80 percent or more these holidays. AAL is a goldmine. You are right to buy and hold. Wide bodies coming online.
AAL has been a disaster!! I'm gonna sell and come back when it hit $10
"Isn't there a Warren Buffet quote that says something like ""The stock market is a system to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient.""? Hopefully, he is right"
Do they allow investors on the Robin Hood app to look at financial statements?
"Since Feb last year, AAL valuation has halved.Parker's plan out of this mess is to continue his terrible gamble of buying back shares and borrowing to fund it.Currently his gamble has elevated AAL's debt from $17B to $26B, earning itself a very low PE, because of how risky the high debt looks in any downturn. Even the buying back of shares has been a wasted usage of money. For 5+ years AAL purchased shares averaging in the mid $40s, and continues to pay interest on the money it borrowed to fund those buybacks. AAL's valuation needs to almost double to make that decision look like a worthy plan.And AAL's Board of Directors supports this gamble? In 5+ years none of them has suggested that AAL simply pay down its debt?Vote NO to Parker and the BOD."
Aal reached $28 in premarket on Thursday... it was up roughly 66%
I'm asking you smart investors when would be a good time to buy.
"So economy is doing great, inflation is happening, and yet recovery stock is sell off together with high growth stock, nothing makes sense."
AAL is poised to have another great week. Will we hit $17?
looks like another tough day for airlines. We'll be fine in the long-term. 
$27 tomorrow and than $30
"AAL up $2. Zacks gave this stock a ""strong sell"" rating. Zacks rating influenced me negatively. I missed today's rally. Good for the current holders."
"To make it simple and don't ask. If the quarter ends today, AAL's Jet fuel cost will be around $1.86/gal, against their midpoint guidance of $2.025/gal, it's $179m of ""savings"". The actual usage maybe less than their 1,085m gallons, and the revenue may also be little lower, but the EPS will be higher than whatever is calculated based on original guidance. That's true for all the Airlines, not just AAL."
"“Travel demand is essentially zero for the foreseeable future and, even with federal assistance that covers a portion of our payroll expense through Sept. 30, we anticipate spending billions of dollars more than we take in for the next several months, while continuing to employ 100% of our workforce,” United spokesman Frank Benenati said in an email. “That’s not sustainable for any company.”"
420 soon!
Lets NEVER FORGET: this was a DISASTER long before the virus ever surfaced
"The market is doing what the marker is supposed to do, just like 11/9, with AAL, UAL, SAVE making big move, DAL, LUV don't jump as much, they'll catch up. AAL has passed $14.41, that's all is important."
"Oil can get irrational in the short term, but OPEC collusion (along with non-OPEC countries joining in that collusion, coupled with Venezuela problems) is something to be taken seriously. DAL implied that they were taking a “wait and see” attitude, but they also indicated they could get disciplined. Others certainly have an incentive to get disciplined, but they have only “talked” about it. What’s the old bartender line? “Talk is cheap, but it takes money to buy whiskey.” What’s the downside to getting discipline and taking oil seriously? Getting pre-tax profits back up to where they were, and where they should be; or, if oil drops, having to deal with great profits; or, showing the investment world that the industry has control over their destiny?"
"Jacks continued to call ALK a ""Strong Sell"" for no reason; it has been suspicious as Vanguard and T Row continued buying it..."
Why airlines is going down everyday??? Anybody been to airport? Did you see how crowded a plane has been?
"New CDC data showed that 4,081,959 does of Vaccine were administered yesterday, this is the 2nd highest since March. Uncle figures the trailing 7-day average of 3.07m does/day was administered or 1,786,536/day of people was taken at least one shot. At this speed we'll get 80% >=18 year old vaccinated by 5/28.Uncle continues to believe USA will have 80% >=18 year old vaccinated before 5/15.Those 75% vaccinated Seniors are Free to travel, actually all 103.5m people who have taken the Vaccine are Free to travel. Make sure to wear Masks around crowds, nobody wants to be blamed for other people's catching virus."
"Because the quantity of shares they have did not fully spend it on you .. Therefore, they sell on themselves, buy and raise the value of the stock until you enter the trap. But people have become more aware and educated and watch you and do not want to risk their savings, which they labored to collect."
"Woke up to Black Friday; AAL closed above $52.Haven’t checked what happened to the market, probably the bond market crashed?"
Any word from anyone about the FINAL distribution?
Lawmakers reach stimulus deal...get ready to take off....
One reason for reduced interest in AAL (and many other airlines) is the continued shift by investors from actively managed mutual funds from passive. Particularly hard hit are Value Funds - the kind that would favor very inexpensive stocks like AAL. As money leaves them it is forced into the many highly valued big cap names (like Amazon) since they are required to own companies in proportion to their market capitalization. Passive investing sounds good until you consider what happens when the market grossly mis-values stocks. The period of 1998-2000 illustrates this. If you bought during that time-frame you would be looking a very small returns over the past 20 years. Not_A_Short

AAL had nice numbers. $40 stock in 6 months or less. Doesn?t matter what the shorts or anyone else is doing. Just #$%$
Who else is entering/adding here? Their push for more corporate bookings sounds good. Delta must make room for aal. Also the Boeing situation should be sorted by EOY 2020 looks good.
"Here's an anecdotal story, not exactly sure what it means. I'm helping a family member book a trip from one of AAL's hubs. for an 800 mile flight next month. I've been watching it for a few weeks,, and AAL's fares always seem crazy high to me: over $400 for basic economy! Frontier has recently entered the market offering 3 or 4 flights a week. Frontier keeps offering the flights for $60 roundtrip. I've been kind of expecting some sort of competitive response from AAL but nope -- AAL's fare has actually increased a few bucks as, I assume, it's been impacted by those fuel-related fare increases. My family member has decided to go ahead and buy the Frontier fare."
Shorts got turned into barbecue today.
"I'm always agnostic about these rallies. I don't think they're predictable, because they're based on emotion. What was predictable was that buying last Thursday and Friday was a good idea. I still think it's crazy for anyone to short this stock here. AAL isn't going broke, and there's no way of knowing how high it may climb in the next several months. Betting on the world to end is usually a very bad bet."
"Uncle bought insurance on SAVE, even it's $1 off Uncle's short-term target of $34.It's selling at 3x Uncle's cost, while AAL is only selling below Uncle's Target.As a matter of Fact, AAL and DAL have not behaved according to Uncle's wish.DAL have sold too many ATM and secondary, and DAL refused to take Uncle's advice at all."
"come on!!! i am back in at 39.15, so close"
"AAL shows improvement after losing 17.72% in 9 straight sessions, Uncle keeps track of all-time record for the period 7/25/2019 to 8/6/2019. Hopefully this will stick. Uncle blames the record losing as ""Trump's unexpected tariff hike and labeling China as currency manipulator"", yeah, this is how it goes down to Uncle's record keeping..."

"Today's action is indicative of how little price in the short term reflects actual value, but rather mainly sentiment, momentum, and technicals. I have no doubt shorts are getting squeezed, traders are getting on the momentum bandwagon, and other are anticipating a shift in sentiment, leading to nearly 20% of performance in the recent months. While fundamentally, not much has changed. Oil has remained high, pricing has improved only marginally, and get this, bag fees have been raised 20%. That's it. Crazy game we play. Value you can only count on in a multi-year time horizon."

"Aggregating to hear the ditto birds in the media say the public has to be convinced that flying is safe.Flying is safe - over 5 million butts per weekHotels are safeCar rentals are safeIt is the friends and family that aren't safe - where the guard gets down - ask the Rock - even though he will say wears a mask - instead of entertain outside for some reasonWith the exception of crowded sweaty discos, stuffy beer halls, group tours, and singing pilgrimages almost everything about travel is safe. It is the lack of open restaurants and hotels, quarantine edicts and closed borders that is slowing the travel recovery, not a safety issue. Ok, grumble out....."
"Every time AAL breaks the 50 DMA we are in store for a few weeks of weak trading. AS long as we hold $30 again, the coiled spring coils tighter to the upside. Breaking through $30 is hard to imagine as well only because of valuation.... However I think there are plenty of market forces incentivised to break this down a couple more bucks. I woudln't sell here, I might initiate a new position, but I'd hold off on adding to an existing one."

"So in semi-vague terms, Isom is telling everyone that AAL is going to make a lot more money in the next couple years, based on various network and sales initiatives. The question is whether you believe him. If the numbers start moving in AAL's favor -- demonstrating that these initiatives are real -- this stock should do very well in the next year. We'll see."
"Short interest settling 4/15/2021 will be published Today.During the period 4/1-4/15, AAL went from $23.90 on 3/31 to $22.13 on 4/15, with daily average volume of 30.8m shares. People love to guess if the Short Interest will be Up or Down, when price movement and daily volume were low may do so. There is NO conspiracy theory, None!"

bankruptcy soon!
AAL is half way through its recovery and we are on the upside trajectory. It's shame that Wall Street firms are restricting people buying the shares of the company!
Gentlemen’s once the markets bounce AAL will be above 22$ and by EOW mark my words dears
At the sfo centurión lounge on a Friday and I have about 20 tables to choose from plus a seat at the bar.
There seems to be an astonishing dichotomy between Wall Street perception of profitability and actual real world profitability here. I hope AAL puts the pedal to the metal on stock buybacks. This looks like an absolute gift to long term shareholders. I also wonder if there's anyone who might want to buy this and take it private. I've wondered this before and it's never happened. But it's going to happen one day at these prices. It has to.
AAL just keeps rolling along.
"buy and hold LONGS, 3rd wave..."
Did it say 22% down post market?
The industry is coming back especially with vaccinations plans worldwide
looks like several European countries are looking at opening up their countries to domestic and US travelers before the summer tourism season starts - ie May 1st - at least for those who have had their shots. but then our dim-wit president SloJoe says we won't do that covid passport stuffAirlines are already running full but this will add the more profitable foreign and business travel
Reasonable merger anniversary story in today's Dallas paper. But no interview of Parker. Should he be all over the media this week?https://www.dallasnews.com/business/american-airlines/2018/12/09/five-years-later-american-fared-following-merger-us-airways
"Vaccine news are looking good, airlines flying full capacity plus summer time its more demand for airlines, also stock got beat down and now its a great. Don’t listen to those short seller have no idea about stock they go and buy puts or short sell based on other opinion then come hare n talk about bearish like man just don’t make the mistake again or go take some trading and investing course"
"Those of you saying AAL will be 25 in a month (lol) please tell me why AAL managed to go from 45 to 25 without covid19, without problems in the economy and even with the revenue increasing."
"At 7:02 EDT, UAL is up $2.69, AAL up $.50 and DAL up zero. It will be interesting if by tomorrow's open UAL can hold $2.69 or better unlike AAL over the years when it had what appeared to be a very good quarter with the post close and pre market shooting up quite nicely followed by a bloody nosedive after the next day's open. I remember one quarter where the pre-market was up over $3.00 and one of the MB contributors was ready to buy a new car until AAL took the big dive after the open and he lamented that his plans had changed drastically! We shall see they say."
"wow, AAL raised fund @13.5 and trading 12.88 right now?..."
"So I guess if you're just reading charts and see a headline like today's ""Boeing MAX crisis taking big toll on three of nation's biggest airlines,"" you could be excused for failing to understand that these airlines are still making billions and billions of dollars. :) I'm not really sure if the airlines are still losing ANY money from the MAX groundings: the increased unit revenue from the scarcity of seats might be outweighing the lose of some general revenue from less capacity. In any event, it's not a huge deal. This is a Boeing problem, not a USA airline problem."
"Took some old friends to get vaccinated Today, they didn't plan to take the vaccine due to uncertainties, it's good they finally made the good decision to do so. Uncle does not force people to take vaccine against their wills, it took time to explain to them with data and statistics. To ease their anxiety, Uncle took them to a Japanese restaurant which only allow 40% capacity, the owner kept coming out to ask if we need anything else, we stay for almost hour and half there so Uncle gave 40% tips to compensate. Maybe Uncle should've giving more, well, it's just a after thought.Checked the entire portfolio, it's another winning day, thanks to the Nazdog.Still didn't do a thing on AAL, even Uncle has been saying when a stock has been down and down lately like AAL, normally, in the past, Uncle would've Sold Puts at the opening. Uncle has been lazy these days, don't want to waste energy trading Airline stocks till DAL says something Uncle likes."
"Every State Must Know how many Vaccine they're going to receive, how many have taken 1st shot and how many the 2nd Shot at all time, aside from capacity to administer and Vaccine.There'll be situation when they have over-capacity after gearing up so many sites for inoculation and the supply all of the sudden get cutoff or delayed. Some may not even get the 2nd shot on time.This all has to do with the 3rd world health infrastructure and NO national heath card.Uncle worries Uncle the most is what happens if we face a biochemical war..."
AAL has the weakest balance sheet! Now even deeper loss!
"Expect another big increase in TSA enplanements this weekend when the gov't releases the stats on Monday morning. AAL is saying that they carried the most pax yesterday since March 19. On that date, there were 620,000 enplanements. AAL is getting more butts into seats than its competitors these days, so we're not going to see 600,000 enplanements, but I'm pretty sure we're going to get deep into the 400,000s. The goal is to see 500K enplanements within 2 weeks. Seems like almost a sure thing. Of course, the real goal is 1 million sometime in July."
$18 today
You guys deserve today. I took the safer route with ALK and LUV. You guys took a riskier path and I'm glad to see it rewarded. Looking forward to crowded skies this summer.
Will we fly again?

"today probably a good time to buy, i see aal heading up from here, probably a double(40+) within 12 months"
Gentleman’s load and hold AAL
"There isn't Anything gain/loss for the market tomorrow when weekly options expires.Most Calls and Puts are already Dead in the water, but AAL does not want to go anywhere.Parker is happy Buyer. Parker regretted he couldn't buy last quarter with extra borrowed money.Poor Parker has NOT bought back a single share for the Shareholders since June 2018."
"Couple thoughts and notes after reading the 8K in its entirety.1 - AAL bought back 8.2mm shares at $42.68. Makes sense as AAL would have been black out for a significant portion of June. 2- casmx revised down 1%. Would have thought this would be good news3- psa loss $35mm. Pretty big snafu. But in absolute terms that’s 7.5 cents per share.4- Asm down, other and cargo revenues up. Pretty much everything in here except revenue 0.5% guide down and psa is good. Still see the value. Next but point is $32. Long enough here"
let ride this baby up to the moon.
"Pay yourself a huge dividend. If you feel safe buying AAL here, you can sell the Apr12 $34 calls for $1.58ish. Consider the short time frame for getting over 4% return on options sold and realize it is near 50% annualized. Of course, you can't repeat this over and over for a year since pps changes, but its a great return for the time period. If you stock isn't called away, you can wait until the stock moves higher and sell calls at an even higher strike. This works best for those who are in tax free accounts of course. It also helps with the frustration of riding the stock up and down and never really getting anywhere. There are many ways to make $$$ and this one has consistently made money for me without the headaches of seeing the stock be manipulated. Hopefully longs here will get a nice move higher in the stock sometime this year!"
haha bankruptcy soon!
"If this were Tesla, AAL's attempt to own the Kalispell, MT summer business next year would be worth 4%. :)Pro tip: if you ever wanted to visit Nova Scotia, do it next summer. AAL is relaunching its PHL flight. Useless fact: every flight to Atlantic Canada from a USA airline fails. I don't know why, but it's true. So go now. Nice destination. I prefer Prince Edward Island, but DL's attempt to serve that market has already failed."
This won't stay down for long!! Bookings up and people are ready to travel again.
"AAL's Short Interest was up to 42,655,910 shares as of 1/15/2020, the 1/31/2020 data is due Today after 4pm."
Oil Price is like Extra Taxing Americans and it's inflationary. Somebody gotta remind Donald Trump!

"Remember the predictions I have provided here and then,TimT13 days ago Replied to a reaction$AAL conversation""And here comes some more speculation based on the original post! - AAL’s share price may exceed the median value of $15.90 after the stock market resumes its activities on 1/28.- AAL’s share price may retreat in the following week after the Q4 earnings. The possible price decline is expected to be between -6.6% and -14%.- The level of volatility suggests that AAL’s share price declined -6.6% (based on the closing price of the week) or as much as 9.3%(the lowest price AAL shares were traded) in the following week after the Q2 earnings. AAL's share price dropped -8.7%(based on the closing price of the week) or as much as -14%(the lowest price AAL shares were traded) after the Q3 earnings.""So they all came out true.I had written weekly and biweekly covered calls on my all AAL long position. I didn't want to lose the stocks but it's in a way nice to know that I am able kept the premiums and the shares for the weekly calls. The next week's covered calls are insured for just over $19. Based on the trend in the previous two quarters, the stock price may start gaining momentum either towards to end of next week or early in the following week. Hopefully, I'll keep the other shares before the stock price gains momentum.Meanwhile $GME short put I have written on Tuesday has given me a little scare but it is nice to know the $GME stock price is way up today. I wouldn't really mind owning the stock since it is very volatile and premiums are succulent for covered calls. Humm"
"What really amazes me is when people think this is the end of the airline industry. Realize that we have come far enough in our lives and in our world that air travel will never go away. This is just a bump in the road and it will all go away sooner than we know. I would venture to say that by late Spring and or early Summer, we will see $30's again and the DOW at 30K+"
"Trump’s press confernece this afternoon was fantastic. Finally. I will give him credit when due. And I’m not even saying this just because he said the is govt would backstop and support airlines 100%. I’m saying it because he finally struck a realistic and reasonable tone about this virus and our response, and kept politics and divisive rhetoric out of it. Finally! Keep it up Donald."
"Buffet is making basic mistakes by selling in red and buying in green. People will fly again,that’s a given."
"I just heard that people will be driving 1800 miles to business meetings, that people will not vacation anymore but go to the end of their street to count cars going by, that from now on everyone will use greyhound busses and Amtrack."

"4Q19 Revenue is around $11,355m and $1.24 EPS, based on Guidance, vs Street estimates of $11,450m revnue and $1.25 EPS.Stock is currently Under Short Squeeze!"
Before last March this was only hovering around 26 a share.I think we are topping out here what do you all think?
Seems clear AAL was a heavy buyer throughout the day today. They aren’t allowed tontrade during the last 15 mins

"1. Air fares in the U.S. rose 1.7% in August on a month-to-month comparison.2. Air fares were up 1.6% in August compared to a year ago on an unadjusted basis.Looks like the fare declining ended in July...That said, most revenue came from ""Others"" than the airfare."
"They have to cover shorts today,"
For sure $11.00 today to many shorts will be running   to the doors . Lol 
All good news for AAL

Exactly 13 trading days from now you will see a spike. Mark my words. July 22nd
I wish the people in this company understood what senior notes were. $10 Billion dollars!!! That’s almost the value of AAL.
Any company that bought back their stock over the last decade should be forced to do a secondary offering before receiving any taxpayer money. Many companies borrowed money to buy back their stock. They dug their own grave and we have a process for that and it is called bankruptcy
"It is Very weird on Yahoo Boards that people can only talk about United's ready for shipping Vaccine, but not America or Delta. As a matter of fact, all Airlines will be Ready in deploying/distributing Vaccine. Legacy Airlines will help international distribution...What's wrong with saying this that Yahoo hates to see, while it continues to let people posting Spams?"
Did you guys notice SW?s report this morning? They lowered PRASM down 2%-up 1% which is down from their original guidance of up 3.5#$%$. However the two horrifying aspects are one SW is basically only domestic so she isn?t hit by the international ramifications at where they are currently and they said they achieved their PRASM goal in January and February. So in other words the month of March saw a drop off of around 10-15% domestically. They did say lower fuel (they hedge) would help offset the 200-300 million cut. That?s a very scary number out of a domestic airline if cases intensify in the US it?ll obviously get worse and the international situation is already worsening.
If the company was not performing poorly the stock would not be trading at 5 times earnings. Fir new investors this is an opportunity
"Does 2 up days constitute a rally? :) In the ultimate Captain Obvious moment, Helene Becker notes that AAL stock is cheap. Jamie Baker seems to have said the same thing yesterday.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b1be578d-4eba-310a-b7d7-c727da05e068/boeing-737-max%E2%80%99s-return-could.html"
I just want to thank everyone here for telling me to hold and curbing my fear with a $40k loss just a few days ago. I appreciate the positive advice and energy!!
"The good news is American remains no immediate threat to end up in bankruptcy. The airline expects to end the third quarter with about $13 billion in available liquidity, and is working toward getting to cash breakeven in 2021 even if demand doesn't return."
Will announce bankruptcy tomorrow!
BUFFET sold Airline s??????AAL up 10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% today
"I suddenly found myself heavily involved in $RKT this week. I think it is going to be my new $AAL, which I have been daily trading since March 2019. Now back to $AAL! I don't know where the price is going to land by Friday closing or on 3/26. The stock price has shown resistance this week thus far. But, you see this is what I was talking about when I said I bought small $17P and $19P 3/26 contracts. My $17Puts had lost half of its value earlier but now the loss reduced and I closed the position for a tiny loss. That put option gained 125% today and had I waited 15 more minutes, I would have even made a tiny profit. However, once my 19P contracts, 4x the $17P in contract size, has surpassed 50% profit just a while ago, I’ve sold half of the $19P contracts at 44% profit thus I recovered the loss from $17 and I have reduced the cost of the purchase of the $19P by almost half which means my current total $19P 3/26 contracts had 133% profit at 70 cents premium value earlier but dropped to 70% currently now that the stock price recovered some of its loss. I still have three weeks for these put contracts to expire. I am waiting until tomorrow to take action for the rest before the closing, hoping for the stock to retreat further. After that, I’ll write some puts to acquire new AAL shares if possible which was my intention initially. After that one, I’ll if buying calls offer better opportunities. If I can’t, I’ll collect premiums. I’ll continue to rollover my long position.OPTIONS CONTRACTS ARE ALL ABOUT TIMING! I told you the stock price was going to retreat because it’s trading on market sentiment and not on fundamentals. Suddenly, $AAL lost its appeal today and the share price loss is higher than the rest including the airline/transportation indexes."
Some kind of announcement must be coming Monday. We had nearly 9 million shares trade at end of day. Parker gone?
"Uncle thinks Buffett has been bottom picking Airlines recently, reason he only made filing on DALhas to do with his holdings has exceeded 10%, 10% ain't anybody's rule but his own, he may ""accidentally"" buy a whole lot before he files soon."
"I was waiting for my 75k to clear my brokerage a couple weeks ago when this spiked to $22+ intra-day.The plan was to buy puts here (with all of it, yes I'm a gambler) at $21.75....but I missed it. (Ugh).Been watching it fall every day this week. Paper traded $15 Puts this week and watched them Quadruple. (Ugh again)Still may hop in on the puts.ZERO good news coming out and with cases spiking in half the states, I don't see anyone rushing to the airport.My call is re-testing lows...and perhaps failing the test, heading lower.Good luck."
Ok can we fly to 25 already?  Pun intended.
"OMG! Kirby upped Domestic Capacity by 10.2%, System Capacity was also Up 6.1%, ahead of 2Q guidance of 4-5%.He said Nothing about his ""believing"" in RASM.Load Factor was only 82.34%."
"Airlines at current prices, it's only good for Uncle Buffett, he'll rethink about buying a whole Airlines.Buffett started accumulating Airline stocks in 3Q16, he bought most of his AAL in 3Q16 and 4Q16; looking for his SEC Form 4 reports, he already got over 10% of AAL and LUV by now."
"Can anyone tell me if there is a single airline analyst out there who has made the most obvious observation about airlines, oil and the economy? That observation, of course, is that the airlines have an excellent ""hedge"" against economic uncertainty as their fuel bill (and therefore, their costs) typically decline significantly when investors worry about the future strength of the economy? Like I know of no other industry that is doing better than the airline industry thanks to all the Wall Street worries. Yet, it doesn't make anyone buy airline stocks -- or even talk about why airlines have a natural economic hedge. Instead, a company like AAL chugs along with it's ridiculously low p/e, even though it's earnings are more reliable than the S&P 500."
Over 20$ by the end of the year. Mark my words and don't regret later!
$GME can issue new stocks any time at much lower price like $20 and burst this bubble. $AMC and $AAL are already planning to take advantage high price of their stock and accumulate cash. $TSLA did the same last year.

Give Parker a lifetime tab at the new DFW terminal bar. That should seal the severance deal and we can begin the tedious operational fix!
Lori Lightfoot's secret admirer is Think........
Average analyst estimate is now for $16/share loss for 2020? JPMorgan wrote yesterday street estimates for a 63% decline in Q3 earnings is still too high. Makes sense with fares down 25% on top of capacity down 40% for July
Delta January 40 straddle priced for a move of 6% into the expected release of quarter results before the bell on January 14.
There’s something wrong with this good volume much better then UAL and with this vaccine news only up 4%? Something is happening behind the scene
Every single person who who says airlines won't fly again. That means no vacations or any trips ever again. I can't see people driving cross country every where around the country?
Any chance this is going up today ?
"Does anyone else out there have a problem with the phrase ""returned cash to shareholders""? As a continuing shareholder I did not receive any cash. It is true that each of the shares I continue to own represents a slightly larger slice of the company, but that is offset by fact that overall pie is shrinking in market value even faster. The market cap 6 years ago was 21.8B (697M shares at $31.35 on 1/23/2014). It presently sits at around $12B. Not_A_Short"

Time to get in? Or wait to find better spot?
"We know that the Trump administration will bail out the airline companies. If this stock price moves under $10, it means the shorts have recovered a great deal of their positions. My best guess is that this stock probably lost a lot of money for many hedge funds over the last year. They have been trying to recoup some of their losses. That is why we are seeing record number of shares change hands daily (10 times the pre-January level). Until things calms down in the market, and the fear of Coronavirus subsides, the stock price fluctuation will remain relatively same (within $3-4 range). If the share price move is wild, it is all speculation, and for the purpose of profiting through price swings in order to recover some of losses. Don't think of it as some new buyers are showing interest in the stock thus causing a price hike. You and I can’t know when it will happen. You need to be on your lucky day. My opinion is, estimate the lowest and highest price points in comparison to other ordinary trading days with AAL, and double the spread. Those should be your lowest and highest price points. Try to get in and out of positions accordingly."
"New Month, New Quarter with New Money coming Monday.Hopefully, some get into the Airlines if the market is getting Smarter!"
"I know most of you hate numbers with fundamentals and just repeat that ""people will fly again"" but just a remainder here.75% if the profits for these airlines come from business travel. Cut that in half and it's almost crippling for an airline and that's in the middle of the good times like 2019.When revenue lacks, you cannot escape debt. The chicken always come home to roost"
ALL just diluted the market by adding millions of shares so careful trying to bring this one up.

Man, all the news are all about guessing what sort of form the package contains... Nobody knows what's in it."

Looks like it's going to go above $15 before the closing hours. Wait for the last hour (maybe 30-40 minutes) and watch this climb. We have been having two very nice days in a row.
"Tommorow's lead editorial in the WSJ: ""How America Broke OPEC.""Personally satisfying, as I've been predicting this for several years. It would have been nice had our financial markets been rational enough to make a buck off this insight."

"Remember I mentioned of FCX for you to take a look at two weeks ago. I targeted an entry position under $30. Today, the stock dropped under $30 from $34.46 on 3/10th.

"Aal is down because of the virus. It is not a risky bet. The worst thing you might have to is hold for a season for a nice profit. As vaccines roll out and travel becomes normal, this stock would have this value and then some. This is not a risky play"
"""DAL filed an investor update today (04/03/18). No big surprises. 1Q18 adjusted RASM came in at +5% vs. prior range of +4-5% and original guide of +2.5-4.5%, as it appears close-in booking strength continued in the three weeks since DAL last updated at a conference. International demand and pricing is likely the main driver. CASMx came in at the high end due to 50bp of weather issues. We are tweaking up our 1Q18 EPS estimate, but we leave our 2018 EPS estimate unchanged. DAL shares remain deeply undervalued relative to the quality of this business, and to the market, in our view. A tired bull case, yeah, maybe, but at some point the market needs to appreciate DAL’s execution. Not sure what else these guys need to do at this point after so many years of consistent results. "" - King Fish"
Nice strong bid into the close!
"$8 billion loss expected for 2020 including the 4.25 billion free grant. Q1 loss was 1.25 billion. Parker guided to 6 billion burn in q2. But this is offset by 4.25 billion free grant. So net 1.75 billion loss in q2. Conservative 3 billion loss in Q3 and 2 billion in Q4 gets you to about 8 billion loss. They were a junk rated Going in to the virus. In order to be considered a viable business that can access credit markets they need to raise the $8 billion equity lost. They need even more equity to cover future losses in 2001 and since the industry is expected to shrink , the business can support less debt than pre-virus so that is even more equity needed! They need triple or quadruple the current market cap. It becomes clear why analysts call the shares worthless. However all hope is not lost. Parker said his plan is to pay back all the new loans with profits. If the industry becomes highly profitable again, it’s conceivable that in 3-5 years American could repair its balance sheet. But make no mistake, right now capital markets for debt and equity are closed which should generate a market value of the shares closer to zero. Any virus 2nd 3rd wave next year would eat up all the remaining liquidity. Other issue is that business travel fares equal up to 70% of the profits and business travel will be slowest to return . Google just announced all workers to work from home rest of year."
AAL has done nothing but climb (pun intended) since it's first downgrade in September lol. 3 downgrades and one Neutral initiated tells you that these analysts are no more than weathermen. When it comes down to it...they don't know JACK! Bullish AF on AAL $20-23 easy in the coming weeks!
"Overloaded with debt and don’t have the revenue. COVID increasing, so any uptick in new flights will be short lived. Looking at an under $10 price target."
"So while at least 51% of the US population seems to think Trump is a bad president, I'm actually impressed by the things this guy has been able to accomplish -- especially since he runs his administration like a hot mess. One thing he seems to have nailed is China trade. China has obviously been taking advantage of the US on trade, and nobody did anything about it until Trump. He's realized the tremendous bargaining position the US has on trade, and is exploiting it to the max. Impressive.The slowing Chinese economy -- due in large part to Trump turning the screws -- has clearly been depressing the enthusiasm to traders to buy oil futures. Now they shouldn't be buying them anyway due to the Permian, but we all know that many oil speculators never met a market they didn't want to speculate in. So the ""China slowdown"" has certainly helped. But it's also not rocket science to predict that China really, really needs to make a trade deal here. And Trump loves to make deals (so much so, that he seems to give away more than he needs to just to brag about making deals). So I think I can predict with 90% certainty that we're going to see a China trade deal in the next few months. Which probably means we're going to see an oil rally of some sort off that deal. Of course with oil, it's impossible to predict the pop, and how long it will last. I guess I can predict that AAL shareholders will get screwed a bit whenever the deal happens!"
"Hurricane Florence is Now Category 2, looks likes it's moving away from AAL's main hub ..."
"Just Sold Short here in the pre-market AAL, 5500 shares at $19.58 average price. This is WAY overvalued and this run-up is unsustainable at the present time. I am making this trade as a daytrade, will Cover by 3:55 PM today and I expect a very nice profit here. The twin tsunamis of global economic weakness and ongoing Covid-19 pandemic are here with us for at least the next 6 months and anyone who thinks leisure travel will not be seriously impacted is delusional. At $19+ AAL is an extremely long-term Buy, but for today it is destined to fall down as rational traders realize the huge over-valuation. Excellent risk/reward odds that this daytrade will work out really nicely. Any position over $19 will make money today as a Short Sell."
Been looking at this stock for awhile now. Haven't bought yet but mighty tempting here! I think Monday I will get in and buy a few thousand shares to start accumulating. Good luck to all longs.
"B of A downgrades to Neutral. Nice work, Parker!"
"Have NO Idea whatsoever if Today's Correction on the Market has anything to do with the chattering the last 2 days on Super Low Volatility Level, some old timers did get nervous, but it's quite arguable if this is too early for the ""Sell in May"" guys to take Pre-emptive action. At least Uncle does NOT buy the Story, a less than 1% Correction to near all-time high major indexes is very Normal event. Of Course, if we see Huge Volume that's different Story. All Major Indexes saw very tiny volumes again their Daily average."
"What I'm still not getting is how everybody is able to ignore the huge pile of debt all travel companies are piling up week by week. It will be though to repay all of it especially considering the additional interest payments in combination with reduced air traffic for quite a while (even after a vaccine). On top of that they are all diluting shareholders by issuing new shares. It's totally delusional to believe that all those stock prices will move back anywhere close to the pre-Covid levels. More shares outstanding, massive amounts of debt and reduced travelling make this totally impossible. #$%$ty balance sheets..."

"Dear investors,lurkersDo you have any suggestions as to my entry point?I kinda like it at this level.As to where AAL stock may go to betwee $30-36 zone I have 2 opposing factors to mentionPositive: Oil likely will stay tame/go down, potential good profit this quarter makes stock cheap.Negative: To support a stock that is traded everyday there needs to be an attraction,it is like selling anything, a demand for stock needs to be prepped and it hard when market makers sentiment is negative on AAL. We have stock purchases, likely profit and that is it, stock is not that sexy to keep demand, thus it could fall to $30ish on boring days with some customer dissataction news etc.I will likely buy AAL this week."
We won't see 20$ for years anymore 
"Listen and Listen Hard to Uncle, whether you're Long or Short.The House is voting on PSP3 Today which potentially will give AAL another $3.087bn in exchange of not laying off workers till September. The Huge difference between PSP/CARES deal and the Stupid CARES Act loan that AAL just rejected lies on how many shares AAL has to doled out and the Freebies (Aka Grant) of $2.191bn AAL is going to receive. PSP3 Loan is expected to be $896m and at current AAL's price is only 4m+ shares.Again, pray for the PSP3 to pass!"
Wish the Market was open now. The US virus data is looking incredibly good. And I don't think many people understand this. We need about 48 hours to confirm the trend. But the county could start reopening within 2 weeks -- way better than anyone believes. Find a mask -- you're going to need to wear one for about 30 days.
"I do not think the investing public takes the airline stock downgrade seriously looking the drop of 5 cents on most of the airline stocks after the news. I have seen banks downgrade INDUSTRIES before, but this one man just downgraded 7 airline stocks in one sentence AFTER an after hours and pre market run up awaiting final approval. Again timing issues with some of these deserve scrutiny with the SEC."
The next wave will be driven by profit estimate cuts I look for another 10 to 15 percent haircut for the market If recession comes more. Stay away from travel sticks for now. More flight restrictions will ge coming
AAL short squeeze!!! Here we go!!!
Anyone checking if fares have dropped ? I just checkef Southwest flight for late february trip and lowest fares are fairly low but no idea if lower than month or two ago..
"Business travel is cooked for at least the next year, possibly longer term as it's been proven much of it is unnecessary. flight credits will take up paid seats. Just don't see a bull case for quite some time. It will come but I think any money in AAL will be sleeping for quite some time. If you can be loooooonnnnggg...could be a good bet. If you need to be liquid..find somewhere else."

"Within this fund, $25 billion is set aside for passenger air carriers and FAR Part 145 repair stations. The definition of “air carrier” used in the legislation is “a citizen of the United States undertaking by any means, directly or indirectly, to provide air transportation.”Application details will be available from the Treasury Department within ten days of the enactment of the CARES Act.Loans are to be as short as possible, not to exceed 5-years.Businesses that receive the loans must make their best efforts to maintain employment levels as of March 25, and not reduce employment levels by more than 10-percent.There are also limits on stock buybacks and executive compensation under the loan program for air carriers.There is an additional $25 billion grant program for passenger air carriers and $4 billion for air cargo carriers to cover salary payments to employees. This would cover salary amounts the air carrier paid from April 1, 2019-Sept. 30, 2019.Air carriers receiving the grants would be required to enter into agreements not to reduce their services.Air Transportation Excise Tax SuspensionBeginning on the date of the enactment of the CARES Act (March 27, 2020) through Jan. 1, 2021, the 7.5% tax on amounts paid for commercial air transportation is suspended.All applicable domestic and international segment fees are also subject to the suspension.In addition, the 6.25-percent tax on air transportation of property is suspended from the date of enactment through Jan. 1, 2021.The excise tax on kerosene used in commercial aviation (generally 4.3 cents/gallon) is also suspended from the date of enactment through Jan. 1, 2021."

"Keeping the middle seat empty is nonsense. “Responsible social distancing in the age of Covid-19 means staying at least 2m (6ft) from other people. But that’s impossible on a modern plane, where seats are around 45cm (17-18 inches) wide, so leaving the middle seat free only keeps you 45cm from your neighbour, side to side. You’d need to be more than four seats apart to keep 2m away. In other words, about as far away as the two window seats in any row of six seats separated by a single aisle. (We’re ignoring, for simplicity’s sake, any travel by passengers or crew up and down the aisle.)That’s side to side. Forwards and backwards, airline seats are spaced in rows around 75-80cm (29-32 inches or so) apart. So, if we wanted to keep people at least 2m apart, that would mean leaving two full rows free between each passenger. What that means is seating four passengers every 26 seats, which translates in percentage form to filling just 15% of seats. That’s what airlines call “load factor”.”"

It's been a year of losing 20, 30, 40, 50 million a day.By the time it goes back to having +11 billion in revenue a quarter how much debt will Doug ""big debt"" Parker have added to this company.This junk is good for short term play but its a horrible investment if you are buying at 21 or 22."

"Hi, I am new to the board, how is everybody? I have been following this board about a month and seen some good posts so decided to sign up.About 10 years ago I traded airlines. Made some money back than but lost it elsewhere later.Now doing a restart and I like AAL as best value so far.My expectation/hope is for fuel price to stay on the low side and and American to improve earnings 2019.I like the new airplanes, goal to improve reliability, making money on airfreight transport etc.Also if I remember correctly Doug Parker was the CEO of an airline I made most money on USAirways as they were undervalued and went up most inprice.Compared to United and Delta I thing now American airlines is undervalued by about 30% at the moment in my primitive calculations.Hope to ride this to $45 and maybe above 2019."

American Air To Fly Near Pre-Pandemic Levels This Summer; Airline Stocks Rebound
"DAL reports great numbers and AAL drops over 2%? What happened, did Parker come out with terrible AAL numbers or is this fallout from the court case against the machinists?"
Any Options traders here? What patterns are you seeing with AAL? Is it turning bullish?
"I think AAL will hit $25-27 and have difficulty going higher. It was already on a downtrend before the Covid lockdown, early last year."

"If this report is correct, the airline lobby is getting everything they asked for from the Feds. The loans are good for the airlines and airline workers, and good for America; the payroll grants seem great for airline employees and a wealth transfer from the American people. We'll see what the details are, as I can't believe an airline pilot is going to get his full salary when a restaurant worker has to survive on some sort of unemployment insurance. I assume there's some limit on the grant payments?https://seekingalpha.com/news/3554817-congress-reportedly-near-deal-for-massive-aviation-sector-bailout"
DAL will make Airlines Great again on 8/2; mark it on your calendar. The Share Price is now at $53.04.
"A truly remarkable transformation of AAL's operation the past couple of months. They're now routinely at 0% cancellations, with solid on-time, and one of the most reliable airlines in the world. Zero mention of this in the media. Rather, if anything is mentioned, there will be some vague statement about ""operational difficulties"" that relate to the long gone mechanics slowdown of the spring. No one is ever forward looking about the company. And now that the operation is great, I'm guessing some analyst will find something else to worry about even though earnings are forecast to be up 20% this quarter. A very bizarre situation here."
"Compare the ignored bad news to the good news. Bad.1. Covid19 spreading like wildfires in other countries. Brazil is toast, Mexico is toast as well. 1000 deaths in Mexico today, more per capita than the US in its worst day. So say goodbye to yet more international travel revenue.2. Several companies already said they are done with business traveling for the year plus done with seminars and conventions. It will be done online and will stay online once they realize what they can save. 3. Unemployment keeps going up. Companies keep laying people off. So tens of thousands of people are already cancelling vacations this year every week.4. Covid19 is getting spikes in cases in the US. Even if the death rate of 1000 people dead a day and 20,000 new cases per day stays steady, it's enough to keep business down.All of these news are enough to guarantee billions in lost revenue for Q3.vs the good newsLoad will increase 55% by July.40% rally in a day and 85% rally in a week lolI bought a bunch of puts at the end. And a couple of calls too just in case the dummy rally continues. If it drops like a brick tomorrow I'll be fine. I think it may keep going up but it will correct itself once reality sets in.Remember, still under 10% of total passengers with a lot more debt."
Congratulations to AAL Union employees. Record pay. BIG raises.

"United’s problems is United’s problem. More of their markets and hubs are in the no go zones.In addition to the end of the off peak season, airlines are likely staying up despite the tidal wave of cathay-virus news because the mid-term(mid-winter) is outweighing the near term.Two items:Historically coronaviruses have exhibited seasonality that ends in the December-February rangeUp to 100 million USAers possibly to have immunity by February, 50 million the hard way and 50 million the annoying way (vaccine); not including any who may have the Tee cell immunity.It has been a few days, so I presume CFRA will issue another reminder that they have an $8 price target on AAL.

Not sure about this stock!""Expert Investors: ""AAL is spending over $4,000,000,000 in overhead, most flights have 10 passengers or less, and is the worst of the worst sector today. Anyone buying AAL might as well light their savings on fire."""
"DAL's results are pretty much what I expected. The ""real money"" in the USA airline industry this year will be Q2 and Q3. It will be very interesting to see what Parker says about that in the call (two more weeks to wait). It would obviously be nice if they could ""over-deliver."" One thing to watch for is the impact of the DFW expansion on earnings. The company claims it will be a big deal; Wall Street is skeptical. I am hoping that it produces something like the results that Kirby achieved at UAL when he took a page from the AAL playbook and optimized UAL's hubs. It's this nuts and bolts stuff that juices earnings. Let's see what Parker says. Of course, the DFW hub benefit would seem to be more of a Q3 benefit, since the flights will be ramping up in the next couple of months."
"After this huge fall, markets could go green tomorrow. Short sellers have about 30 minutes to cover :)"
Looking at this go up premarket. Wow. I’ve never seen anything quite like this. We’re not trading on fundamentals or value right now.

"We've broken through all technical supports. There is little reason to buy with all actual data related to the business more than a month away. The market is weak. I'm not selling but I'm not expecting much. There is a value floor somewhere, even at the low end of guidance of $5.50 this year, I'm really not sure how low it could go before some value investors ignore the technicals and buy. That price though can't be too much lower than this. For the rest of us, you can look at what the company is expected to earn over the next 3-4 years, factor in slower global growth (which BTW = lower oil) and do your own math."
"If Mister Market began to value the airlines more in line with historical valuations of cyclical companies (high single digit PE of 8 or 9), AAL would be priced $48-$54 a share. All this talk of how Parker has squandered the buyback money would dissipate. Not_A_Short"

"I have said previously that the share price of AA might’ve started moving up towards the end of the past week or early in this week according to the Q2 and Q3 patterns. Three out of four predictions I’ve made based on that a week before Q4 earnings were spot on. I shared them with you here at the time. All three quarters' results occurred during COV-19 pandemic, a very unique time period, so I thought there had to be some similarities I could use to incorporate in my trading activities. I traded based on those predictions prior to the earnings, and they’ve paid handsomely. I bought weekly and bi-weekly calls deep ITM at the start of the last week. I was assigned two-thirds of the shares over the weekend. I may receive the rest on Friday. Their cost is just under $17.50. The decision behind these calls is to generate returns by writing covered calls on the entirety of my AAL long position. AAL share price is very volatile although the stock price was repressed due to the low volume and high level of options contracts last week. I think the stock has more upside than downside. If the stock price climbs up, it will bring about 15% of return on the new calls in less than a month which may allow me to let go off my entire AAL long position temporarily at the least.The only thing that makes me believe the stock has the potential to go a lot higher in the near future is due to the market trend and how traders treat certain stocks, and it may benefit AAL shareholders. However, I am concerned on two things in the coming days: VIX is being at the bottom and XAL at its peak, and the number of options contracts are high for this week ....BUT, not in the next two weeks!!!"
Honestly I'm not bullish on airlines but I personally think this will be a case of selling after the news of a vaccine. Like I do think this will fly when there is a news of an approved vaccine but earnings will eventually matter and it will take years before these guys get back to their pre-covid earnings. I could see a scenario of this stock going to like 23 or 24 due to the short squeeze and then settling in the 16-18 range because people know this will take awhile to recover. I mean who knows but I think buying at these levels will make you some good money at some point in the coming months you just gotta be patient.
"Nice weekly spool in enplanements here. 1.1 million. If we don't get another Covid wave, we'll see 2 million in May. If we get another (likely small) spike, we'll probably see 1.5 million then."

"Senate Republicans Introduce Bill To Extend PSP Through March 2021WASHINGTON—In a last-ditch effort to prevent mass airline employee furloughs beginning Oct. 1., two U.S. Senate Republicans introduced a bill to extend the Payroll Support Program (PSP) through March 31, 2021. Originally enacted as part of the CARES Act coronavirus relief bill on March 31, the PSP funded the bulk of U.S. airline labor costs during the 2020 second and third-quarters, under the condition that airlines avoid involuntary furloughs through Sept. 30. But with the original deadline fast approaching, demand remains stuck around 30% of last year’s level, leading carriers to warn of tens of thousands of potential furloughs beginning Oct. 1.The Air Carrier Worker Support Extension Act, introduced Sept. 21 by a pair of Senate Republicans, seeks to bypass congressional gridlock surrounding a larger coronavirus relief package by making airline industry aid into a standalone bill. The bill’s sponsors are senators Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), chairs of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, respectively.With about $28 billion earmarked for passenger airlines, cargo airlines and contractors, the proposed program is nearly identical to its previous iteration. Roughly $11 billion of the total funding amount will be new appropriations, while the remaining $17.4 billion will be repurposed from unspent CARES Act secured loans, originally provided as part of a $25 billion lending facility that accompanied the PSP. Because the secured loans proved to be unpopular with carriers, however, an additional round was left out of the latest bill.As in the original PSP, the extension would require carriers to continue service to most points in their pre-pandemic networks. While this requirement succeeded in boosting connectivity across the U.S. during the spring and summer, it also forced airlines to operate near-empty flights on many routes. Some carriers, like American Airlines, have already announced plans to eliminate select routes beginning Oct. 1—plans that will likely have to be shelved should Congress deliver another round of airline relief.Additionally, the proposed extension would renew a ban on stock buybacks and dividends, as well as limits on executive pay, through March 31, 2021. It would also require airlines to issue warrants to the U.S. Treasury Department as a form of taxpayer protection. The original PSP required large carriers to repay around 30% of their total payroll funds, with warrants issued to the Treasury equaling one tenth of that amount.“"

"It looks to me that once you borrowed money from CARES Act Loan from Treasury, you still have to give the government Warrants even you prepaid the loan.

30$ ____ ok ok 20-18-15 ox ox
Well the country is reopened and travelers only 13% of year ago. I would of guessed 30-50% on pent up demand. I guess shorts have nothing to worry about. AAL needs 75% of year ago to make a run at break even. Fuel prices have been rising faster than passengers off the bottom.
Will close over $18 today .

"All right how many times can you cry Wolf?

Better than expected. Let shorts digest Q3 ER!- Loss $5.54 vs.$5.86 beat est.- Revenue: $3.17 billion vs. $2.81 beat est.- Ended third quarter with approximately $13.6 billion of total available liquidity.
Interesting that today's rally in AAL didn't fade near the close. I think every other upward move in the past month did fade. Maybe it means something. Maybe not. It's hard to make any sense of what market participants have been thinking lately.
Cashing out! Taking my profits. That’s how it’s done boys and girls.

Parker’s personal Friday AAL stock sale saved him nearly a Quarter Million Dollars in 3 1/2 trading sessions. How is your stock doing? Grand plans to spend that massive AAL dividend which is now just over 1/2 a money market?
"The $25 billion loan program of the CARES act must be deemed a failure. Nearing 3 months from its passage not $1 has reached its potential recipients. I presume it fell under the pitfalls of writing legislation too quickly, but it surely has not met it's intent of providing quick and not too onerous capital.With their $4 billion selling/borrowing spree it makes me wonder if they are going to forgo or seriously curtail the $4.75 billion they were intending to borrow from Treasury. If they are going to pass on the Treasury loan I would then say the underwhelming price point of $13.50 and high rates are a good deal. Given AAL's penchant for share buybacks, we should fully expect that the Convertible Notes will get repaid and never converted. They have 5 years.""The Convertible Notes will be convertible by holders into shares of Common Stock if certain conditions are met and during certain periods, based on an initial conversion rate of 61.7284 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $16.20 per share, representing a premium of 20.0% above the offering price per share in the Common Stock Offering. The Company will settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof at the Company’s election""The deal is expected to close tomorrow, after that we will get a better sense of current market price.Meanwhile, if you'd told me a month ago AAL would be at $14, I would've been a happy camper.The short covering super rally has left us with grander current expectations."
"A classic ""sell the news"" -- even better than expected news -- market reaction to the airline sector? Particularly weird because the virus situation is also getting better faster-than-expected. But that's the Market for you: the hardest game in the world, even though so few participants realize it."

AAL will be back over $20's with in the next 6 months. People will over Christmas. Buy the dips & make money. Government will not let the major airlines go bust.

"Stimulus signed , think itll move the Airlines today?"
"American is closing three European outstations: Manchester (MAN), Prague (PRG) and Reykjavik (KEF). It’s also dropping service to Venice (VCE) until 2022 at the earliest, a carrier spokesperson confirmed to TPG.Instead of offering service from Philadelphia to the aforementioned airports, the carrier plans to redeploy the unused aircraft to Latin America and the Caribbean, according to an internal memo posted by xJonNYC and later confirmed by a spokesperson in a statement.The move leaves Philadelphia, once AA’s main East Coast transatlantic gateway with just 12 long-haul European destinations slated for 2021, including Amsterdam (AMS), Paris (CDG) and London Heathrow (LHR), among others.In American’s latest update that hit this week, the carrier added nearly 2,300 new flights to the Caribbean and Latin American for 2021, boosting the number of available seats by over 8% systemwide, according to Cirium schedules. Meanwhile, European flights were slashed by almost 10%.Over the past few years, American has see-sawed on its approach to its two main Northeast hubs, New York-JFK and Philadelphia. Leading up to the pandemic, AA was busy winding down much of its long-haul flying from JFK, leaving just the bread-and-butter business routes to places like London and Sao Paulo and shifting the remainder to Philly.But the pandemic has, in part, upended that strategy. With the retirement of the Boeing 757, AA doesn’t have a narrow-body capable of flying some of the “thinner” European routes from Philly. (The Airbus A321XLR, slated to replace the 757, won’t arrive until 2023 at the earliest.)Coupled with the upcoming Northeast-focused alliance with JetBlue, American plans to once again boost international flying from JFK, while somewhat scaling back in Philly with the aforementioned route suspensions.The carrier has already announced plans to launch nonstops from JFK to both Athens and Tel Aviv in 2021, replacing the carrier’s legacy Philadelphia to Tel Aviv service.Going up against JetBlue in South FloridaWhile soon-to-be partners American and JetBlue are set to cozy up in the Northeast, things are cooling off down south.Last week, JetBlue announced a bevy of new routes, including, perhaps most interestingly, three destinations from Miami (MIA) — a new city for JetBlue.American has long operated a fortress hub in Miami, so this move by JetBlue seems aimed at capturing market share from its soon-to-be partner.Now, AA appears to have retaliated over the weekend.Starting roughly two months after JetBlue’s Miami inaugural, American plans to add three of its own routes from JetBlue’s South Florida hub in Fort Lauderdale (FLL).American will add service to Boston (BOS), Los Angeles (LAX) and New York-JFK beginning on April 2, 2021, on a mix of Airbus A321neos and Boeing 737-800s. Perhaps not coincidentally, those new destinations from Fort Lauderdale represent JetBlue’s two biggest hubs (JFK and Boston) and its newest base in Southern California (LAX).All three routes technically represent service resumptions for the carrier, though the timing points to a jab at JetBlue. Cirium schedules show that AA last operated flights from FLL to Boston in 2005 and service to JFK and LAX in 2013.From Charlotte to paradiseWith most of the carrier’s long-haul flying temporarily suspended due to the coronavirus-related drop in demand, American has been deploying its wide-body jets on domestic routes.Come May 6, 2021, American will launch non-stop Charlotte (CLT) to Honolulu (HNL) service on the Boeing 777-200, representing the first time the carrier has flown the route since 2010 when it last flew with the US Airways livery.This 4,679-mile, ten-hour flight will be the carrier’s longest to Hawaii and comes just weeks after Hawaiian Airlines announced new service to Austin (AUS) and Orlando (MCO).With spare planes and international destinations closed to tourists, American may be betting that it can (at least) break even on the new route. Only time will tell if the Charlotte to Hawaii flights will perform better than they did during the three months it flew between 2009 and 2010.Entrenching Dallas/Fort WorthThroughout the pandemic, the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) airport briefly became the country’s busiest, thanks in part to American doubling down at its fortress mega-hub.Dallas flights addition to adding new flights from Dallas to Eugene (EUG), Fairbanks (FAI), Fayetteville (FAY), and St. George (SGU), American is also gearing up to go head-to-head with Southwest in Long Beach (LGB)."

My hedge firm will short 10% more.
Dirt cheap fares to destinations all over country and TSA numbers still stuck at 13%. Maybe they jump up this week? Other parts of economy like mortgage applications have shot above 100% of year ago exhibiting pent up demand. Air travel not showing any life at all.

simple formula for trading syccess:Do the opposite of what Cramer advise!
Does anyone think this could be as bad as the 2008 recession? AAL dropped to $2.50 and didn't recover its share price for about 5 or 6 years.

These very expensive large new aircraft sitting around, not making money, loans are still due and no high fare Business fares being sold. What are we at now, 9 straight days of falling? Is it 5 o'clock in the Executive Office?"
and have you guys already seen AMC NETWORKS??? It has more than double of short interest! 60% Enjoy the ride
"Still way below 10% of last yr at this point of the quarter.Jobs being lost left and right. Even doctors and nurses are getting furloughs and layoffs since general practices are delayed unless is an emergency. When everything is ""back to normal"" there will be 60 million people out of work with the States being completely bankrupt.The economic impact of virus is what airline permabulls are ignoring the most."
23$ by EOW Gentlemen’s mark my words the whole industry will have a great news sooner than we expected
GME was up 20% this morning. Now down. Those that had huge profits in GME are selling so they can pile into AAL.

"As I keep mentioning I am long on AAL. I wanted to buy calls yesterday but I couldn't due to volatility. I would like to try it again today. However, my feeling is that even if the stock price climbs a bit at the opening, watch out, it may go down quickly, that's when I'd like to see if I still want to buy calls."
HOOOOLD the BAG! $0 SOON! <3
"Okay, I'd like a real tangible explanation for the benefits of perceiving a company through the EPS, rather than what it earns and what it owes. In 5 years, I've watched a CEO (Parker) spent $11B on buying back shares to make that number look good rather than allocating it to reduce the post-merger debt. At post-merger the total shares were 720M, and the debt was $17B, today it's 450M shares and the debt is $25B with an annual debt payment of $1.1B. If Parker has spent the $11B against the debt, the shares would be 720M and the debt would be $6B with an annual debt payment of $0.25B. That's a savings of $0.86B annually.Buying back shares has not increased AAL's bottom line whereas reducing the debt could have, in fact that $11B spent on buybacks has had a total effect of zero, same as flushing it down the toilet."
"AAL trading is starting to feel a bit more sane, lot less volatility. Healthier, even when down."
A trading buddy asked me the other day about AAL and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
"International travel by the masses......like going to Thailand for a week vacation........never made any sense. That kind of ""thing"" was once reserved for the very rich...........and will again be. Smaller planes, very expensive seats, and few travelers who actually can pay cash for their vacation instead of loading their credit cards. The rest of the masses will visit the NP's and the beaches at home (the US). Money will be spent ""here"" rather than ""there"" which can be very good for all along the way."

"52,771 new cases nationally today.14% higher (7000) than the previous record 5 days ago (45,xxx)Just my opinion but I say the lows get tested in the next month.I don't see how the amount of flights is going to matter if a large segment of the population is terrified to fly......and numbers like 100,000 new cases a day (a number we could absolutely be headed for) will absolutely have that affect.Good luck."
"There's a very interesting chart in a not-very-interesting Seeking Alpha article entitled ""American Airlines: A Bargain At A Forward P/E Ratio Of 5.2 But Leveraged."" The chart shows that, over the past 5 years, AAL trades at a forward p/e of about 9. Now it's 5.2. So, basically, the entire damage to AAL stock price has nothing to do with the actual business of the company, but everything to do with investor sentiment."

Opportunity to purchase AAL tomorrow pre-market !!!!!!!!
"yall see the poll they posted 2 days ago. 62% of leisure travelers voted they would not fly in 2020! I dont know how much evidence you bulls need. I think the only thing that will make you realize is the word straight from the CEOs mouth ""Bankrupt"" But dont yall worry that's coming soon!Cash burn 10M a month. Vacation season over. Vaccine delay. More travel restrictions today. Covid cases sky rocketing. 2nd wave undeniable. If your not short at this point you have no idea what you are doing in the stock market."
"So I'm looking at this week's EIA oil numbers. Domestic production is now 11 million barrels a day. A year ago, it was 8.8 million barrels. That's a 25% increase in production. To say that increase is ""mind-boggling"" would be an understatement. Despite this unprecedented increase, US oil prices are up 40% during that time! There are no other dramatic increases in supply and demand in the rest of the world: it would be fair to say they balance out. Is there nobody who wants to look at the influence of paper financial trading in the oil market? I mean, this is nuts."
"There is lot of pent up demand for US travel and once the vaccine is approved, the airlines will be milking the money by bookings. Just think for a second, about half the US population want a break from staying home (pandemic fatigue) and many will be going on vacations or visiting families. AAL will make money and it will reflect in stock price. Hold it and she will reward you, Santa will deliver your wishes!"
"People will fly. Fact. It is not a question if TSA numbers will go back to 2 mio but when. And it is not question if stock price will go beyond 30$, beyond 40$ but when."

After that, lots of people will have their Vaccine taken and there will be more people traveling in the summer, especially after August.There is no need to pretend that airlines will do better in 1Q than 4Q20, they're normally the weak quarters anyway.

"I'm not sure what to make of Bob Crandall's interview. I don't think airlines should be public utilities. I think they work fine as ""normal"" public companies. What is happening here -- or at least what we so far THINK is happening here -- is the Worst Possible Scenario for an airline. It's basically zero revenue. Do we really need to restructure the airline industry to deal with this type of problem. I guess if you think another global pandemic is going to be coming down the pike again soon, I suppose we could do something. But modeling your business for the apocalypse seems wrong. As I've noted here for years, there were only 3 real risks to AAL shareholders: global war, economic collapse and pandemic. Sadly, we got at least one of these, and it happened at a time when the stock was otherwise absurdly undervalued. Basically, the worst of all worlds. And, yet, it STILL looks probable that things will turn out OK! So maybe ""doing something close to nothing"" would be the right strategy? Do we really want AAL to now keep, say, $20 billion in cash on hand?https://www.yahoo.com/finance/video/isn-t-clear-aid-airline-164345651.html"

"Huh, interesting! I have placed a small buy order at $30.25 in AH trading. It was executed. I really did not expect it. What I expected for tomorrow was for the stock price to climb to $30.85-31 range prior to retreating if at all. So far I haven't come across any negative news about AA but the most recent orders in the after hour session were executed lower than closing price, $31-31.25. I wonder if the share price starts coming down tomorrow."

"AAL closed today Up after closing gap, with an indecisive DoJi. Will AAL reverse the downturn Up tomorrow?We'll See."
Why AAL has such high volume when the share price is rock bottom?
"So I'm now more worried about the MAX returning to service than being grounded. Why? Because I (sadly) have a low opinion of the rationality and intelligence of humans. When AAL puts its 24 MAXes back in service, you're going to get some folks (in the short term) booking away from AAL because of the chance (2% or so) that they might be on a MAX aircraft.I doubt any airline will go for it, but this is what I'd do to return the airplanes to service. For the first month, I'd segregate the fleet and fly them only on a specific few routes. I would then offer discounted promotional fares on those routes. The human desire for a bargain would trump the fear. In a month, everyone will forget about it and the planes will be good to go back into regular service."
"Too many times now, I've failed to sell when green and buy back when Red. Once again we hit $14, come back to my computer and its Red! Just too hard to believe it keeps happening. Long term we should be alright, but to recoup losses must play the game like everyone else. Buy low, sell high, rinse repeat as they say"
"AAL has been in a downward trend for the last 18 months. The 5 year chart shows a recent triple bottom over a five year period. Also the directional trend last for about 18 months before reaching a 52 week top, or a 52 week low. Also interesting is how Doug Parker bought shares very close to the 52 week lows of last week."

Covered my AAL Short at $18.54 for a VERY nice gain of $5.7k. That's the way to play the market and to set yourself up for a happy weekend! Good Luck to All!
This was down in the $2s during the financial crisis. This is far worse and I just was able to short at $13.33. I think a gm style bankruptcy is likely. Either way I think this stock is not even worth $5 based on their debt and outlook.

"Europe and the USA are now making REMARKABLE progress in getting rid of the coronavirus. Spain today has fewer than 100 deaths. Hospitalizations are falling fast along the I-95 corridor, which is the center of the USA outbreak. Meanwhile, the states that have reopened are doing the best! The poor-judgment Democratic governors will be FORCED to open up their states this week, or face mass civil disobedience (California could get interesting if their idiotic governor doesn't quickly use some common sense). You never know what the Market will do, but I think it's going to rally strong this week. Investors are very confused by the airline stocks right now (we have a stupid narrative by ignorant people that AAL is somehow in risk of bankruptcy because of the misinterpreted Boeing remarks), but traffic is going to rebound strongly here. My estimate of 500,000 daily enplanements by the end of June looks to me like an underestimation. We may see 1 million enplanements in July! AAL was very smart to be flying 2x the capacity of its rivals in June. What may trigger a rally in the sector is when all the major airlines start taking their aircraft out of storage. AAL should benefit from the real resumption of transatlantic travel in August."
Abandoned ship today with a decent profit. I ll jump back in shortly.
Shorts are working OVERTIME to get this under 22 by close... wonder why?
Exactly when is earnings announcement??
will closed at 16$ or less today careful wait for it to come down then buy.
"Aal is quite low right now tbh. Sure, it did reach $8 per share 2 months ago but soon after it also climbed all the way to $22 before falling back to 15$ and staying around $15 for a couple of weeks. Notice the trend, the stock falls after earnings are terrible but beat estimates. Aal before was also barely moving per day 2 months ago at $8 per share. It would move like 0.3% max which for a stock with this volume was nothing. After about 2 weeks of barely any % movement of the stock, it jumped and rallied all the way to $22 per share. All it needed was a little bit of vaccine development moves and it jumped. I get it, people are talking about how American Airlines is burning through cash and losing money and etc but the company and economy are far different than the actual stock price. The economy is clearly crashing but stocks are rising? Makes no sense right? I’m telling u, the stock market is apart from the economy. When people want to buy a certain stock and raise it they will jump in at any time. It’s all about noticing the trends and factors that contribute to rally’s of certain stocks. Right now the stock isn’t moving much daily, it beat earning reports, vaccine orders are coming in and sooner or later you’ll see the news of phase 3 vaccine trials from moderna or something. Notice a trend from when it rallied 2 months ago? Long term is definetly a hold but at the current price and with the trends in the market, Aal along with other airlines will most probably rally again in August or September. Now I’m not telling you or convincing you to buy Aal like half of the other people on this conversation but I’m indeed noticing similar trends from before and for the time being I’m bullish about this stock. I don’t know if someone will actually read this long post but if you’ve made it this far I just want to say, trade wisely and good luck trading!"
How much will American Airlines have in debt by the summer?
the fact is in the long run things will get back to normal and airlines will reach their 52 week high again. we or don't know how long but this could happen quickly. A lot of money waiting on the side line to get in
"The short interest (SI) decreased by 95M shares as of 2/26 in 2021, which is a drop of 55.44% in short interest. However, SI is still higher by 30.73M shares than February 2020 closing. But, if you take the increase in AAL’s floating shares into account (up by 50%), it’s 67.36% higher than where it was in February 2020 or we can say,Back in Feb 2020, the SI ratio was 10.7%As of Feb 2021 closing, the SI ratio is 11.94%Furthermore, AAL’ share price has gained 32.78% in value ($5.17) while the short interest decreased by 95M shares or 55.44% in the first two months of 2021.Last but not least, AAL’ shares were trading around $30(the peak point) back in mid-February 2012 when the news broke out about COVID-19 virus and the share price began depreciating, so we can say that AAL’s share price is still 36% lower than a year ago.Trade cautiously and happy trading."

I guarantee it!"
"I sent this suggestion to the CEO of American Airlines: TO: William Parker, CEO,I have an idea for you: Is it possible for AAL to reconfigure the oxygen drop down mask system to either a negative pressure or normal pressure mask which can be either worn over a surgical mask so that air breathed by the passengers throughout the entire flight would be safer, and then you wouldn't have to worry so much about social distancing since aerosolized droplets are the main spread of Covid-19. If passengers could wear the masks the entire flight and be insured they would be breathing outside air, it would go a long way towards safety and confidence, and AAL could fill the seats to maximum capacity."
"Last week AAL was in serious trouble, Doom and Gloom, bankruptcy was inevitable.

"Chinese Domestic Capacity Near 90% Of 2019 LevelEIJING—Chinese airlines are running around 90% as much domestic capacity as they did a year ago and plan to step up to 96% next week.Loads remain poor, however. Airlines are deliberately rebuilding capacity in advance of demand, in part to make use of otherwise idle employees, industry managers said.The latest surge in domestic capacity follows one that began in April and stabilized in May, according to available-seat-kilometer data from OAG and CAPA – Centre for Aviation. For the three weeks beginning May 11, scheduled domestic capacity was 80% as much as a year earlier or just below, compared with an average of 63% for most of March and April. This jumped to 90% last week and is at 88% this week. Although the schedules for next week show 96% of last year’s equivalent domestic capacity is planned, that figure might not be reached since the airlines can make late adjustments.Also, 90% of 2019’s level does not quite mean 90% of normality, since airlines would have run more capacity in 2020 had the coronavirus pandemic not struck. In the eight weeks before the emergency was recognized in January, they ran about 6% more domestic capacity than a year earlier.Domestic passenger load factors have been weak. For May, the average was 65.2% with only a faint upward trend, according to Chinese data firm Variflight. This is not a result of regulation: there is no limit in China on passenger load factors or spacing on domestic flights to minimize infection, though international flights cannot be more than 75% full.Chinese state companies, including the great bulk of the commercial aviation industry, are generally not allowed to retrench or furlough employees. A further factor behind the premature rebuilding of capacity, managers said, is that running services as normally as possible will encourage customers to come back. Avoiding cancellations is seen as especially important.Yields for the Chinese industry are not available but some indication for the domestic market is given by the trend in fares for a weekday economy flight on the country’s traditionally busiest air route, Beijing-Shanghai. Booked about a week ahead, the typical price for mid-June is typically CNY400-500 ($56-70), compared with CNY500-600 three weeks earlier and CNY1,000 or so before the pandemic. This also suggests that the industry is moving faster than demand in the domestic market.Chinese airlines’ international passenger capacity has been 5-7% of the level of a year before since early April, with no sustained upward or downward trend, according to the OAG and CAPA data.B Perret"

"I know the discussion on the board is more day to day activity, but I have a question that is longer term. AAL is about 4-5 years behind DAL in merger integration. AAL mentioned that they have about $3.9 billion in initiatives coming over the next 3 years. About $1.3 billion this year, and then again in 2019 and 2020. Each year they estimate about $335 million in cost savings and about a billion in revenue initiatives. My question … Is that revenue initiative net of costs? It seems it should be, but need to ask.Another $2.6 billion to the bottom line over the next two years is substantial. So, is that what AAL is saying?"
"I started this roller coaster ride because of the ""VIRUS"" and lost my job. Bought 500 AAL @ 12.29, 5000 Val @ .40 and 50,000 of AIRTW @ .07.I'm playing scared, any suggestions on when to get out???"
"AAL is the USA launch customer of the A321xlr. Seems like a VERY good plane for AAL to own. The devil is in the details, but it looks like these are mostly conversions of existing orders, so maybe not a lot more debt than initially planned?Here are the details of the plane:____________________________________The European aircraft maker said that the A321XLR, an upgrade to its popular A321neo narrow-body plane, is expected to enter service in 2023, several years before any new Boeing midsize plane would be ready. The Airbus model is aimed at replacing Boeing’s out-of-production 757 and some slightly larger 767s.The U.S. company has been discussing its concept for a new midsize jetliner with airlines, but hasn’t confirmed it will build the plane. Boeing’s tentative plan calls for the aircraft to enter fleets around 2025, though analysts say the timing could be affected by the crisis surrounding the grounding of the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes.Airbus’s A321XLR is being designed to fly 4,700 nautical miles, connecting such cities as Barcelona and Chicago. It would be used on routes where demand typically isn’t strong enough to warrant the larger, wide-body planes traditionally used on flights between the U.S. and Europe."
The same s.it again today
"Just tried to call customer service and was advised of a 17-22 minute hold time. Seriously American, if you want to play with the big boys then starting acting like it rather than some penny pinching airline."

"So I keep watching the virus situation in China. I think the Chinese economy is toast for Q1. Even if the virus does not spread widely throughout the country, China is still going to be on lockdown for at least another month. It's bad in Wuhan and they won't want to risk making it bad elsewhere. I'm going to be shocked if oil doesn't trade down at least another 5 bucks on this news. I'm thinking $10 is likely. How the US economy does is still uncertain. I do not believe the virus is going to be ""a big deal"" in the USA, but we certainly could get a bigger scare. For the moment, no problem for AAL (profits are probably increase due to the cheaper fuel), but this is the definitely the biggest issue at the moment."
Airlines for America reports that the blended spot price for jet fuel today is $1.61/gallon. Do the math folks. This is an epic windfall. Parker can at least buyback stock with it even if the Market can't do the math or doesn't care.
"John Kerry Envoy was welcomed by mini bus in Shanghai, it costs less than $200 to rent a mini bus, what a treat! No escorts, None, only one police car following... The Street seemed to be cleared ahead of time."
Let's all keep in mind that the market DOES in fact do irrational things. Not all prices have to make sense. Remember when AAL lost 1/6 of it's value in two days just because of Brexit?
"Ok, this to me feels like an overreaction. There may be more pain ahead but we are still living in an oligopoly that has proven to be able to contain fare wars in the recent past. I am hoping for tempered growth language tomorrow morning to support the idea that United's actions will stay between them and the ULCC's."
Let’s hold tomorrow I don’t feel like American Airlines investors should loose money because the hedge funds that short the market can go CNBC and try to monopolize the stock.
Bow. Wow.
"Honestly, I logged on to leave a comment here to say that watch out this stock go down below $15 by Friday but I just saw it's already trading below $16 in premarket. One thing I have observed in a long time of trading is that these big price fluctuations and particularly, price going up ridiculously with no logical basis should be worrisome for many. This is also happening before Q2 report. That would mean, market-movers pulled the price as high as possible prior to possibly dumping the shares on the ordinary folks once again. They have already been doing it for a few days. For those who are optimistic about airline sector, ask yourself what the Q2 earnings will look like? I hope I am mistaken but if you are a short term long position investor on airline sector and particularly on AAL, you better be careful. A lot of things makes no sense in the market and trading equities is no longer what it was in the past. Trend does matter! If some big traders attract enough numbers and mobilize them like heard, they may achieve what they want. I have been long on ALL since March 2019, I locked in for the sale price of $15.55 due Friday. Yes, It looks like I got out too early and missed a great opportunity that could have tripled my gains. However, I believe I did better than Warren Buffett, who took a lot of loss and got out of the airlines. He is sitting on a lot of cash, he has been patient. His time will come. I'll be waiting to see the developments in the coming days. You need to pay attention to some developments in the overall market. The economist are estimating that the U.S. economy will shrink more than 30% for the quarter and over 5% for the year. Imagine airlines stock prices stayed low and they provided the quarterly financial reports. What do you think the stock price would have been then? But now, if it goes down, it goes down either to prior level or below, which means everyone including all big investors except short position holders lose. This was an opportunity for them to strategize their overall position with minimum damage or some profits. As I said in my previous posts, pricing will be based on manipulations and speculations until planes are flying with 80% and above. The debt is piling up for companies and consumers. 42 millions of lost jobs will not be regained in a short time while the presidential election is approaching. Hence, you trade base on speculation for the next 6 months. I called it back then, in the earlier period of the pandemic, when the big pricing fluctuations occurred that trading will resume based on speculations, and find the highest lowest figures for the period, $3-4 range, and get in and out of trades.Technology stocks have done well but they will be affected as well once the demand slows down for tech stocks. There are some who are immune to the recent crises but they are not many. Investors are going for those stocks because they seem to protect their money even if the gains may be small compare to the previous financial periods.ps. when I started writing this post, the premarket price was $15.92 and now it's under $14.97."
Spring break rush. Just hold airlines for ayear and you'll all do fine.
$aal and $dal are in top 15 most bought stock on Robinhood
"112,000 shares here.Not selling till 35. Period:)Happy days"
"Did anyone ever figure out why AAL dramatically went from $12 to $18 in a couple days on huge volume, only to fall back to $10.29? Did someone help the stock higher so they could buy a bunch of puts? I didn't notice what the option volume was that day. Its always hard to sell a losing position. The $18 price gave me hope the price was stabilizing. Wish I had that chance to sell back again."
Today we earn our fat dividend. Where will you spend your dime? I appreciate the creation of Basic Economy fares. Tailor made for AAL shareholders.
I don't trade on Robinhood trading platform but I strongly believe it should be shut down and the creators of the platform should be banned for life from involving in any sort of trading activities after paying for the losses the retail investors have endured recently.
If earnings beat expectations I can see a pop to 38 by end of next week. Even 42 by end of year.
What happened to the Parker countdown clock?
"He can’t inspire managers. He can’t inspire employees. And he obviously can’t inspire investors and analysts. Game over. Goodbye. A $15 Billion market cap mistake is where we draw the line in the sand. AMR owners, those still financially afloat, have seen how this movie ends when it’s not edited. It’s not too late...I think."

"American Airlines Seeks To Grow Profitability On U.S. CoastsBen GoldsteinAmerican Airlines is using the air travel downturn as an opportunity to expand into the U.S. northeast and west coast markets where the carrier has struggled for years to compete against Delta Air Lines and United Airlines.Nearly half of American’s total capacity is deployed at its two largest hubs in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), where it commands revenue premiums of 10-12% over the industry average, American chief revenue officer Vasu Raja said on the company’s 2020 second quarter (Q2) earnings call July 23. By contrast, the airline’s operations in the northeast and west coast produce a 10% unit revenue deficit, leaving it in a precarious competitive position in those critical markets. “We are in a situation where we’re really too small to win and too big to exit,” Raja said of coastal markets like Boston, New York and Seattle. American is eager to rectify that imbalance through codeshare partnerships with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines and New York-based JetBlue. Those carriers will provide feed in their coastal strongholds that American will rely on to launch a slate of new long-haul routes in 2021, including Seattle-Bangalore (India) and New York JFK-Tel Aviv. “The play here is that, if we can do this, we go and attract more customers to our joined-up networks,” Raja said. “Financially, that rectifies a very massive revenue problem that we have across our hub system and creates a really pro-competitive outcome.”American leaned heavily into its DFW and Charlotte hubs during the quarter ended June 30, as the region was spared the brunt of the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a far greater impact in the northeast and west coast regions than the country’s interior. That situation has largely reversed, however, with infection rates rising in July across the southern U.S., reducing demand at both of American’s main hubs. As a result, the carrier is cutting flights from its August schedule and now plans to operate 40% of its year-ago capacity during the third quarter (Q3), less than previously planned but still more than either Delta (25%) or United (35%). “We made a tactical decision to fly a larger schedule than some of our competitors did, keeping our connecting hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth and Charlotte larger than the rest of our network,” American chairman and CEO Doug Parker said. “The hubs at DFW and Charlotte performed particularly well, with 80% of our flights operating at over 60% load factors in June. But this rate of improvement is going to slow ... due to increasing infection rates and state and local quarantines.”American’s greater capacity has also translated to increased cash burn, as the company bled $55 million per day in Q2, compared to $43 million at Delta and $40 million at United. Still, American has managed to trim daily losses to $30 million by the end of June through aggressive cost-cutting, roughly in line with its main rivals. Management said the company remains on track to be cash-positive by 2021—which will be key to managing a ballooning $50 billion debt load—helped on by expectations of higher demand and lower labor costs in the second half of 2020. American posted a Q2 net loss of $2.1 billion, reversed from a $662 million net profit a year ago, on total operating revenue of $1.6 billion, an 86% drop from $11.96 billion in 2Q 2019. By comparison, United recorded a $1.6 billion net loss, while Delta had the industry’s largest at $5.7 billion, adjusted down to 3.2 billion when certain one-off expenses related to fleet retirements are subtracted out.The company ended the June quarter with $10.2 billion in liquidity, which it expects to grow to $16.2 billion in Q3, including the proceeds generated from two recently announced secured notes transactions worth $1.2 billion, and a U.S. Treasury Department loan worth $4.75 billion that the company expects to close in the third quarter."
"Total Cash (mrq)Total Cash Per Share (mrq)From AAL 10Q filing Certain of our debt financing agreements contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities and/or contain loan to value and debt service coverage ratio covenants. So available cash is actually 4.86B Which is 7.83 per share.Projected loss in 2021 is 7.98 per share.That projected loss may not account for increased fuel costs, which are trending to be 20% to 30% higher than a quarter ago. Increased fuel expenses may add $1B to $2B to previous estimated losses.I think the U.S. government will keep lending them money, so BK is probably not a big concern. But by the time they get back to operational profitability, I think the bondholders basically own the company as they will receive all of the profits for a long time."
"DAL sees 'strong' summer revenue, AAL backs 2019 EPS $4-6/share. No really substance but good enough to keep the Airlines from market correction."
"Please remember:The current CEO loves bankruptcy, mergers, stock buybacks. 50 billion in last 8 years wasted on wall street stock buybacks. American owns absolutely nothing and even leases it’s office chairs. Even at $9 bucks I’m really not sure what you are buying, maybe a route structure but who is going to fly overseas anytime soon(if ever)."
"Despite it's craziness, the Market seems to have a decent handle on the virus fears and is trading accordingly. We have new fears this week due to more cases in places like Florida, Texas, Arizona and California. I am 95% certain those numbers are just noise based on more testing and their distance from the NYC epicenter (they're simply on the plateau and not sliding down the backside like places closer to NYC). From Europe and the states closer to NYC, we know exactly what the virus does, which is to go away -- but relatively SLOWLY. The fact that deaths are significantly decreasing in the supposedly ""increasing"" states tells me those increases are noise. All this will be obvious in about a week, because the virus does only one thing: it goes away."
AAL might have more customers and revenue if they didn't support BLM.
Air travel is a commodity. AAL is the top airline.
"never been late to buy AAL now, AAL real price is 25+"
"We know that buybacks paused in 3q due to cash balance minimum requirements, but what about 4q ? Today is first day would be able to buy after 10-25 report. Whats Uncle say ?"
No meaningful News Today. Uncle makes one: DAL is due to hike dividend Next quarter from $1.40 to $1.60 (35c to 40c quarterly).

"AAL & UAL are back to BUY signal, HA aren't."
Connect the dots. Air travel is tanking. Earnings will drop big. Airline earnings will be cut in half. Not a bear. Just realistic

"I am going to Mexico for Spring break. No thoughts of canceling. Going to Atlanta in April, No thoughts of canceling. Going to Italy in May, no thoughts of canceling. Not really scared about getting corona virus. Probably won't get it and if I did, I would recover. If I were a senior citizen or had a respiratory impairment, I might think differently. Of course in that situation I would be predisposed to a number of potential ailments besides corona. Also, my work colleague traveled from Denver to Philadelphia this weekend. I asked if flight / airport was empty. He said just the opposite. It took forever to get through security due to so many people traveling and flight was totally full. My point? this is over done hysteria. Should there be some negative reaction? You bet ! But to this level? No way! For that reason, I am a buyer at this level with a 50% + gain in a year when the stock is back over $30"

"Looks like we are in for another bad day tomorrow, but today is promising. We got to hear that management has a plan, and we are starting to see signs that the US is taking mitigation seriously. Not sure how to pick a buy point on AAL, holding for now and will not buy more until 13s. I did buy some SPY at 2780, but that’s in a 30 year horizon ira."

"American Airlines initiated at Argus American Airlines initiated with a Hold at Argus. Argus analyst John Staszak initiated American Airlines with a Hold rating, saying the airline is expected to face rising costs and revenue headwinds in the near term. The analyst also warns about pressure on margins and earnings coming from the company's planned 3% increase in capacity. Staszak contends that while the airline trades at 6-times his expected forward earnings vs. 9-times peer average, the discount is warranted given its ""above-average leverage and prospects for higher costs and modest revenue growth."""

"If AAL was to go bankrupt they would’ve done so already. Nearly 85% of flights were grounded for months, this is the beginning of the turn around.Grab a seat, buckle up and get ready to hit the skies."
"So far today, AAL has only 10 flights cancelled systemwide, and half of those are due to riots in Barcelona. This is only slightly below average for the past month, which represents a complete turnaround from the unreliable operation AAL ran last spring due to the illegal mechanics slowdown. It is interesting to see how important the ""rule of law"" can be: had AAL had to go before a ""California judge,"" the workers would probably still be on slowdown and the company would be suffering reduced revenue and be unable to pay its mechanics any wage increases whatsoever. This ""Texas justice"" is a win-win for everyone -- except perhaps AAL's competitors."

"Best decision of my life was to realize a six figure loss in March and sell AAL at 13.58. I've since recouped my losses (albeit with double the investment size of AAL when I sold it) but I'd be in much worse shape than if I held it. I'm checking back on the stock now and then and I just can't see a reason to jump in now. There is so much uncertainty, and the balance sheet just gets worse every day."
"If you look at the max chart, you will notice back in 2008 when we had are last recession, it took until 2014 for AAL to fully recover. It’s possible that we will have to wait a similar time frame to start seeing major returns. Comments and thoughts ..."

"The White House on Thursday rejected media reports it is considering any new domestic air travel restrictions.""To be clear, there have been no decisions made around additional public health measures for domestic travel safety. The regency is continuing to discuss recommendations across the travel space, but no specific decisions are under consideration,"" a White House spokesman told Reuters.Reports that the regency was considering imposing restrictions on travel to Florida brought denunciations from many Republican lawmakers.The chief executives of major U.S. airlines are scheduled to meet virtually on Friday with the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator to discuss travel-related issues, Reuters reported Wednesday.The meeting with coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients and other regency officials involved in COVID-19 issues comes as airlines, aviation unions and other industry groups have strongly objected to the possibility of requiring COVID-19 testing before boarding domestic flights.Southwest Airlines Co Chief Executive Gary Kelly and the leaders of the airline's unions urged the Beeden regency in a letter not to mandate COVID-19 testing, saying it would put ""jobs at risk.""""Such a mandate would be counterproductive, costly, and have serious unintended consequences,"" said the letter, which was dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last month said the Beeden regency was ""actively looking"" at expanding mandatory COVID-19 testing to U.S. domestic flights. The CDC on Jan. 26 began requiring negative COVID-19 tests or evidence of recovery from the disease from nearly all U.S.-bound international passengers age 2 and older.One idea that has been under review within the Beeden regency is for the CDC to issue recommendations advising against travel to areas of the United States with high COVID-19 caseloads, but no decisions have been made and recommendations would not be binding, officials said."
"Red balance sheet, OK. Over leveraged, SURE. Bad leadership, YES SIR! Don't care one bit what is said, this company has the largest fleet of planes in the world in the greatest country in the world. It's not going anywhere and guess what, you disagree with me? Short it! I've been buying shares and long term options with it since March. Prove me wrong, give it your best shot. Been bored recently."
Crazy not to buy the airlines right now. Final boarding call before the impending 20% pop.
"Vaccine is good news that will help airlines in Q2/Q3 of 2021. Vaccine also makes people push flights back because they finally see the end of the tunnel. Vaccine also boosted crude oil price above $40 for a while now making airline flights not so cheap anymore.Vaccine also will remove pressure from passing a stimulus bill soon as everyone is focused on the vaccine and elections now. LUV, SAVE and DAL will be fine, and strive on the fact their competitors like AAL and UAL will soon exit the market."
"Personally this is my suggestion to all those that are holding the stock. It is imminent that this is on downward path at this point. So you should sell your stock at this level and buy back at $13 - 14 level. This way you save some value on the downward path and can buy back more shares with same money at a lower level. Now timing is everything. So be sure to pull the triggers at the right levels. Also time your share settlement time properly. Sometimes when you sell your shares, funds are not immediately available for you to buy back. If I were you, I would have sold morning before the dropping happened, but I do not hold any positions at this point. However, I will be watching this closely and might buy some shares at $13.50 level (If that happens), otherwise, oh well :) gotta look for other stocks."
Lol it’s boggling my mind every investment forum always have at least few people manipulating others for selfish personal gains
"The Street does know what we don't. It explained why DAL has been so weak lately.The quarterly update proved my ""fear"" was 100% correct on higher CASM-ex, lower Capacity, thus lower revenue, though the EPS guidance at the midpoint is only 2c lower."

"Weekend virus data can be risky to analyze, but the hospitalization numbers seem to be regularly updated and reliable. They show hospitalizations plunging in the eastern half of the nation and the ""healing wave"" now reaches places like Chicago. This is what the virus does, even though nobody in gov't or the media seems to grasp it. We just need the Southwest (CA & AZ) to start sliding down the curve -- as they will in the next 2 weeks. The virus has now become predictable -- which is very good for investing purposes."
"I developed pessimism prior to quarterly financials over the years. Simply, I can't know what direction the price movement will happen until the trading starts as I have seen the prices of many stock I have held went downward after having great quarterly report while others moved upward when the quarterly results weren't good. Sometimes it went up as expected and then came down or vice versa during the day. So I am never complacent prior to earnings. I have gained enough experience over the years so what I do is I try to gain leverage by reducing the core quantity about 30% by selling them a little bit at a time before the earnings. I do that if I have any worry about it (for exp. any negative news about the company, sector, market and etc). I usually start doing it in the last month of the quarterly period. It's a slow process particularly when the stock price is coming down, it's difficult to sell them at a higher price than you paid for.I mentioned the other day that I reduced my position by 30% at an average price of $29.30 between the start of the year and yesterday morning. Somehow, my intraday trading didn't exactly go well yesterday and I found out I purchased more shares by the end of the day than the amount I liquidated in the month. So I had no choice to keep the previous core quantity and sold the rest during after hours trading. The only positive thing was that the additional shares had an average price of $27.50. Still, it kept me awake the entire night. I watched some movies and then spent hours going through financials, analysts' estimates, comparing everything to my own data and charts prior to making my strategy for the day. I am relieved to see today has turned out to be good in spite of what it was like in the early hours."
"So Greg now says he sold AAL way back at $43.Even though he throws a fit every 20 cent downtick.Even though he said he has a $37 stop loss on everything..Interesting dude, huh?"
AAL is not pulling all the park planes back to full service by the end of June.Since Europe is now open for all travelers who has gotten vaccine.
Shorters hve lost today.. this is what happens when you follow Cramer advice!
"I wonder what AAL would be worth if broken up? Their large fleet of planes would fetch quite a bit. The huge backlog of Boeing and Airbus means that AAL's very modern fleet would sell well. The international landing slots also would bring in a lot. I suspect the unions would not be happy, but then again they are perpetually unhappy. The workers they represent (mostly very good employees) would have no trouble finding work and would benefit from not working in such a toxic environment (at least that is what the union keeps describing it as)At some price point it will attract outside interest.Not_A_Short"

"United Airlines to Resume 25 International Routes in SeptemberThey be thinking things will be better next month......United Airlines (UA) announced today its plans to resume service on nearly 30 international routes in September. Flights include those to Asia, India, Australia, Israel, and Latin America.The airline will continue to add ways for customers to travel to popular Caribbean, Hawaiian, and Mexican holiday destinations.“We continue to be realistic in our approach to building back our international and domestic schedules by closely monitoring customer demand and flying where people want to go,” said Patrick Quayle, United’s vice president of International Network and Alliances.“In September, we’re adding even more options for leisure travelers or those who want to visit friends and relatives.

"To me we are nearing maximum fear in AAL, and it's actually very company specific as articles I'm reading are focusing on AAL specific trifecta - debt, MAX, unions. Anyway, what does Buffett say to do when fear is rampant?"

any opinions if china usa deal will impact AAL stock price ?
"Though PAX average Quarter to yesterday was at 42.55% or down 57.45% of 2019, yesterday's PAX was already crossed 2020's (higher).

"Last Quarter, a $2 billion drop in revenues produced a $2 billion operating loss. Which begs the question, how large a loss will AAL report on a $6 billion drop in revenues this quarter? Will they report an operating loss of $6 to $8 billion? What will that do to their Shareholder's Equity account? Isn't their Shareholder's Equity already negative by now?

AAL NEXT WEEK BACK TO $ 50.00
"DAL didn't report traffic for December, so they probably Stopped reporting without spelling it out.Now we can only invest in the Airlines with our own judgement/Imagination?This all come at the worst time of the year when Airlines normally make least money in 1Q, Jet Fuel Cost is all we can hope (it to stay lower for longer)."
"Nobody much cares about fundamentals these days (why would you?) but it is interesting that the relative strength of the route networks the Big Three inherited after the somewhat-random mergers have played no role in the relative success of these airlines. Objectively, UAL wound up with the best network, AAL second, and DAL third. Few, I think would dispute this. DAL wound up with the worst hubs with ATL being the only one anyone would covet."
This has 300% upside at these levels.
Yay - another spring sale! Loading up for the rebound.
What a run up
Gentleman’s load and hold we are heading to 52 weeks record high
"If AAL is serious about staying in business, the are some costs AAL simply can't reduce starting with theinterest payments on they debt. After that they have to pay maintenance on their planes. They can reduce the number of flights for sure but what does that do for their revenues? Revenues go down, certain fixed costs stay the same and bingo, we have AAL filing chapter 11. It's just a matter of time boys and girls."
"After TSA will go over 1,5 mio to 1,7 mio we will see +30$. Stay and hold!"
"I swears god, it will hit $30 soon."
"We could really use oil to go negative here. If it did, the psychology could change. It does seem like the speculators are a bit worried about putting money into oil at the current price. And given that that's a massively overbought trade, we could get an oil correction. Nobody really knows, of course. But if some of that $2.3 billion in fuel cost shifted the other way, suddenly AAL's short term earnings ""woes"" would disappear.That said, it's more likely to have an oil correction in summer than spring. Historically, at least."

"Latest report is that there's now a done deal in Washington to provide $25 billion in GRANTS to the airlines, along with loans. Details will be forthcoming."
last pop before bankruptcy!
"Company estimates $6B in free cash flow next two years and says net adjusted debt will fall by of $3-4B. However, $815MM of that debt decline is due to pension contributions, which are already included in free cash flow. After factoring in dividends, AAL should have $2.5-3.5B available for buybacks in 2020 and 2021.Even if AAL only buys back $1B/year, that equates to about $6.7MM in buybacks on every non-blackout day the stock market is open (buyback blackout is 5 weeks around earnings). At a share price of $26.75, that means the company is on average buying back 250K shares every day they can buyback shares.Something has to give in the coming years, especially when AAL is reducing both debt (and therefore interest payments) along with the share count. A company with a 14.5% earnings yield and a free cash flow yield over 25%, that is also buying back nearly 10% of the company each year, will not stay at the current stock price. Either earnings and FCF will drop or the stock will rise."
"Enplanements are rising again as the country figures out that you don't get the virus flying -- or really from doing anything ""normal."" This will give the airlines more breathing room as we await the return to normality. Hard to predict that timeline. A vaccine, while medically unnecessary at this point due to widespread herd immunity, may be emotionally important."
This is comical. Truly.
"For all of you posting about bankruptcy, it’s not on the table. Airlines tend to file because: 1) they have out of market labor agreements, 2) to get out of an order book of aircraft deliveries, 3) they can’t meet their pension obligations, or 5) have onerous debt terms. They don’t fit into any of those categories. Their labor contracts are at market, their aircraft Capex is winding down, they don’t have any trouble meeting pension obligations, and their average cost of debt is just over 4% and the only debt covenant they have is to maintain a liquidity balance of $2 billion (they have access to $17B when the new PSP is considered). So bankruptcy doesn’t solve any of those problems and it doesn’t get passengers on airplanes."
Hope AAL can go back to $20 in coming week!
$5.4 billion locked in so far from Boeing. We will see how that charge translates to benefits/cash for airlines....

"Guys understand that AAL is just too big to fail, it is a National Treasure. This will go up +20 once the Vaccine news hit and back to 30s prime, in April next year. The government wouldn't just give them 5B bailout for no reason. Don't also forget that this is an Infrastracutual company with the biggest Plane fleet of 1500 Aircraft."
"Most probably 26 is its peak and it will be testing at 25. If it falls below 25, bearish ahead."

AAL is very connected to tourism and 80% of this year holidays are booked. Travel agencies report that most deals are much higher then previous years since people have double budgets. I see a strong jump in July and August. At that time vaccination will start bring stronger results.

"So, I have a question for the board here. The entire market is down over 1% today, AAL is down almost $1 per share, so if all of this is normal reaction due to the markets tanking and all airlines are down with it, then why is it that LUV is only down $0.20 per share today? What do they have over the rest of the market to survive such and onslaught today???????????"
"As usual, this stock is trading irrationally. People were too pessimistic. Now they are too optimistic. The facts on the ground have not changed. The fundamental problem is that there is no a person on earth who can tell you what this company is actually worth."
"AAL stayed strong yesterday and XAL, JETS, DJT and all major airlines did well. While the later ones were low, AAL kept climbing today. The support is conspicuous by the long position holders. AAL share price depreciated just above 70% after the outbreak of COVID-19. The stock price is trading at 30% discount currently. Some of the institutional investors increased their long positions while AAL shares became one of the favorites for many retail traders to capitalize on recently. AAL is trading on sentiment and not fundamentals. Excluding extraordinary events, AAL share price may continue to move upward for another 15% or so before Q12021. However any higher value for AAL shares depends on the company's financial performance. Unless the institutional investors are convinced that that may happen in the near future, they won't boost their position and the buy trend will wane in time until the Q1 earnings. Since the AAL stocks are trading on sentiment, and the market sentiment can change anytime in addition to ""that time of the year, the tax filing month, soon to be arriving, I don't expect June 2020, and January 28th style spikes. Meanwhile, I started watching the developments on RKT shares rather late, just yesterday. Since I missed the boat and anyway I didn't have much to spare change for it, I did a quick a few minutes of look into its financials. I had a couple minutes to decide and I sold PUTs instead of buying calls while the stock was trading at $40. Oh boy, I am glad I went with that decision. Look where the share price is today! My put contract was @$27.5 03/12, and just a while ago, I wrote another PUT contract @$25.50 3/12. I am not sure if the stock price will drop below $26.50 or even $25.05(break even point) but I really do like to own that stock even if it goes below $25. Imagine I bought a call at $35 or $40 yesterday. That is why I say ""be cautious"" don't fall into FOMO trap. Same goes with AAL. Don't rush, just buy AAL at a discounted price. If you can't, hey keep the monetary gift the market gives to you."
AAL is going up with demand going up balance sheet looks better it will be 45.00 per share in 6 months

"""Should American Airlines Receive Assistance?American Airlines, in my opinion, should not receive any government assistance. The reason that I say this is that American Airlines is still full speed ahead with its project Oasis. If you are not familiar with project Oasis, it is the American Airlines 737 cabin refurbishment program to:Increase the number of seats,Reduce seat size in both economy and first class andShrinking the size of the lavatories.As I mentioned in what airlines should be doing, refurbishing passenger cabins while losing substantial amounts of money isn’t one of them.

Anybody who knows AAL since at least March knows it’s time to buy right now and keep a little more to leverage down if it goes to $16.50 tomorrow.
"AAL will go up even if it’s go down to $6...If you focus on short-term prices, theres risk in overreacting to the noise and selling potential winners way too early — sometimes at a loss! Don't invest in short-term stock prices. Invest in the long-term success of businesses.If you buy fewer than 15 stocks, you may not be diversified enough. A portfolio with just a few stocks could be extremely volatile. And investors like you risk missing out on potentially the biggest winners that have driven our history of outperformance.Investing only in stocks could force investors to sell off investments at the worst possible time — when the market is down! Thats a terrible scenario.Borrowing money to invest in stocks puts investors in a very fragile position. Then theyre at the whim of lenders who can force them to sell at massive losses. We've seen investors borrow money and accelerate gains in the short term, only to get wiped out entirely when the market declines. Bad idea!Don't let losing stocks scare you away from investing for the long term. Every investor has stocks that go down. Historically investors earn great returns if youre right just six or seven out of every 10 stock investments."

"In the last month, I have stated that there was possibly going to be a discussion of bankruptcy protection for AA if the company's shares continue to lose value. Then, I said the U.S. will be in recession over the weekend. Currently, the Trump Administration focused on bailing out the airline companies. The recession enter into the discussion as of Monday. The other two issues I have stressed on a few times since last fall were ending buyback programs and getting rid of dividends. Well, the CEOs of the airlines companies have already said a few days ago that they stopped the buyback programs. The next conversation will be about stopping paying out dividends till some unknown time in the future. I think the administration will make it part of the deal for companies to receive any bailout money. There will be probably a few more provisions in the deal such as limitations in compensation package the executives receive."

"The Fed package is fairly cut and dry now. The longer this drags out, the more I think the airlines are looking at some other solutions. Boeing, Disney etc got some nice loans in the banking sector.."
"Another natural hedge, I think, but probably not to the extent of oil is labor. I have asked this a few times over the last several years. In a downturn labor might not be as much of a fixed cost as people think … or ""is there a single analyst out there"" who has discussed that? I think that unlike in the past, the airlines have more flexibility in labor savings in the face of a downturn. So, oil is a hedge and so is labor."
"AAL is currently down 4.69% on something it didn't do at all, and AAL is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) which is very rare since Airlines normally get #3 (Hold) at the best."

"If this tax plan goes through and Fed rates from from 35% to 20%, AAL will see a substantial increase in net income (and earnings per share) Last year they had a effective tax rate of 38%.

Election spending was at a record...Zuc knows this and that is why he wasn’t worried. A bounce in the stock cures any displeasure talks. Buy Buy Buy, not too late to get in and join me. Oh by the way, Parker was so worried last quarter that he could not afford not to talk up their initiatives and cost cutting as well as future reduction in capes... he basically laid it on the line during the first 1st Q presentation and now he really need to show positive results from his road plan or else he will be fired...as you can see his former lieutenant that is now at UAL is doing things that’s keeping the share price at the high while AAL is the big laggard. This is not lost in Parker’s and he knows it. So he basically said no more excuses we will go up from here or you, the board, share holders can do as you wish with me. I have no doubt this time he will see some very good results and uptrends in Aal’s share price going forward and may even surpass his competitors....2019 all time high for the stock....barring recession in 2020 of course."
"Cowen upped DAL's target from $44 to $53 as expected, ahead of earnings.It doesn't help much, people are busy getting into straddle buying ahead of earnings report, nobody knows what they're going to guide. This quarter is all about guidance again, guidance was given earlier and the Street estimates have not changed accordingly."
Today the climate in the market was not good. However AAL showed good behaviour and good volume. It seems the investors are betting in a turnaround story for the share. Have stopped burning cash and now is on a break even point. The aviation industry is recovering slowly but steadily. Next week if the climate helps we will see higher level. Needs patience..
"The smart money bet was that Berkshire/Buffet would sell out all of their remaining shares of AAL. But now that he didn't, that bet is no good anymore."
"Rating Action: Moody's downgrades all of its ratings of American Airlines Group, corporate family to B2; outlook negative28 May 2020New York, May 28, 2020 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") downgraded all of its ratings of American Airlines Group Inc., including those assigned to subsidiary American Airlines, Inc. (together, ""American""); corporate family rating to B2 from Ba3, probability of default rating to B2-PD from Ba3-PD, senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from B1, and senior secured debt ratings to Ba3 from Ba1. Moody's also downgraded each of its ratings on the company's Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (""EETCs""), and the company's speculative grade liquidity rating to SGL-3 from SGL-2. The ratings outlook is negative. These rating actions conclude the review for downgrade initiated on March 17, 2020. Please see the end of this press release for the detailed list of rating actions taken today.The downgrade of the senior unsecured rating by three notches versus the two-notch decline in the corporate family rating reflects the increasing proportion of senior secured obligations in the company's capital structure, which diminishes the value available to unsecured claims in the application of Moody's Loss Given Default rating methodology."

"Uncle will take $30, if AAL can get it there this Life.AAL is a Love and Hate Story, Robinhoods love it because the stock can jump the most when it's not going BK sooner than later, there's no way it's going to recover as much as its peers when all the shares it offered are either exercised or converted, the ATM all sold, along with 2 Secondary offers, the share counts as of today tracked by Uncle is already over 770m shares, higher than 1/1/2014 when they started trading after last BK. The dividend adjusted all-time high for AAL was $56.99 with 474m shares or $27m market cap, that's about $34.5 at over 777m shares. Uncle will take $30, at discount, if AAL will ever get there in This Life. That said, $13 is still cheap, honestly speaking."
"I guess the coronavirus data for the day is basically done. The two biggest scientific developments today were the sharp increase in New York metro area infections -- confirmed by a sharp increase in deaths (about 60 in the metro area) -- and what seems to be the start of a material decline in cases in Europe. One day does not make a trend, however, and the next few days will be hugely important to determining what we're dealing with. Overall, though, I would say there is way more panic in the rest of America than there is actual disease. Washington State -- which was initially feared to be the next Wuhan -- has an un-whopping number of about 200 new cases and 1 death. Given the somewhat insane restrictions on human activity that have now been imposed almost nationwide, it would be shocking to see the infection rates climb much from here -- especially after the next few days, when all the social-distancing policies start exceeding the incubation period. In a few days, I believe we may all become much more concerned by the economic consequences of our actions than by the actual risk of disease. I do not believe we have hit Max Panic yet, but I suspect it is not many days away."
"The day is still young in the USA but, so far, it's been pretty quiet on the coronavirus front. Too soon to declare victory, but favorable downtrend in Europe infections. If Europe looks positive Monday morning and nothing big happens in the USA over the weekend, there will be a significant rally in AAL. I would call that the ""best case scenario,"" however. The odds say there will be some sort of bad news somewhere. The Grand Princess isn't as scary as a breakout in NYC, but I suspect there will be drama with that story.Heading to the airport soon. Some members of my family have already been travelling this morning and they report calm and somewhat uncrowded airport experiences."

American airlines will beat earnings tomorrow and climb to $30 by midsummer
"History keeps happening in Airlines; Nothing is new other than (different) Time.Even the way People talked; well, at least Kirby brought us back Cav who has been trying to be a fundamental guy these days, maybe he’ll buy back some Slowly at better prices after figuring out the tax effects.We will see if the sentiment improved after Super Thursday (when more airlines report and guide)."
"ARAMCO priced at top of the range, $1.7 trillion. Oil prices also rallied 6% leading up to the pricing. Interesting!"
love it. 1000 shares at 11.02 avg. will buy 200 more for every .50 it drops. most comfortable I have ever been with a stock. 12 mos I will double...
"Regarding $AAL -Things to consider when trading We all need to be paying attention to a few things in order to see improvement in $AAL stock price:COVID-19.The number of new cases have been dropping sharply since mid January but the number of casualties to pandemic hasn't shown similar improvement. It is still at the peak level. Vaccination will be available for many Americans before summer.2) TSA numbers.The WoW numbers were positive last week for the first time however, they need to start picking up faster. We need to see +900k and above. Hopefully, it may improve by the end of the month. If not, then, it will be concerning.3) Economy.The U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said that if the stimulus package is large enough, around $2T, the U.S. could reach full employment by next year. Thus, 1+2 should help the recovery of the airline sector.4) Available liquidity in the market place and low interest rate.That also explains the soaring asset prices including the risky and volatile crypto currencies.5) Oil prices.Oil price is soaring but I believe it is mainly due to the low production. It should be short term issue. Many oil producing countries are struggling economically and this is not simply because of the pandemic. If you look at those producers they have many problems to deal with at home.They're not only highly dependent on the revenues generated by oil exports but they are also very corrupt, politically unstable. They will have either elections coming up or the regimes in those countries are threatened by the domestic factors. In order to prevent further instability in the domestic front, they will be forced to increase production to inject money into social programs.Some of these nations like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Russia, Iran, and Qatar are all involved in proxy wars against each other in multiple fronts. The competition for market share will increase thus it will help stabilize the price of oil, and it may even cause a decline in price.The silver lining is that the more production and competition following a contraction will improve global GDP and overall spending.6) Price volatility in respect to AAL's short interest.The SI of 25% is rather high. Based on the trend, the short interest doesn't drop unless the price retreats and volume stays low for a period of time as it has been lately. As a result, the short interest shrunk by 10.9% in the first period of January 2021 while the average daily volume of trading(ADTV) was just under 50M, a half of the previous month when the short interest increased.The short volume can also drop if the volume is up due to short squeeze as it happened during the pre-market on the day of the Q4 earnings, 1/28 with a little support from $GME, and it also happened between mid November and mid-December.I have analyzed and posted on it on Y!F at the time. There has been new buyers and longs have increased their position while the shorts have also bought back shares as the prices started climbing. As a result, the ADVT increased during that period.For instance, during the first half of the month of November, the short position was reduced by 18%, 30.917 million shares, and the AAL share price closed with 11.5% gain (keep in mind that the stock has gained as much as 31% on the penultimate day of the same period). Notwithstanding, the short interest was almost identical in the second half of the month of November - no rise or drop in AAL's short interest- however the gain in stock value was15.4%. It means we have those who either opened new positions or increased their existing long positions.Reiterating, in a nutshell, the stock has gained as much as 42.4% in value while the short interest reduced by 18% in the month of November however the majority of the gains occurred during a period when there was no decrease in short interest. Thus, the short coverage was only partially responsible but increase in new long position was mainly the making of the Bulls.If we look at the recent activities, it appears that in the second half of January, the short interest was on the rise until 1/28, assuming there happened a short squeeze out of fear during the pre-market on the day of the Q4 earnings. The stock price descended once the news that Robinhood and a few other brokerage firms stopped the buy orders from small retailers. Then, we observed a drastic drop in daily volume activities. Also, the short interest continued to shrink in the first week of February as the daily trading volume kept at low level.Based on the trend, once the shorts reduce the short interest by 8% - 15%, they start dumping large quantities in the market to push the stock price further down due to the low demand for AAL shares in the past but that trend has changed which I have explained below next.

"Given that I am obliged to worry about ""something"" when it comes to owning an airline stock (all long term airline investors know why I worry), I'm focused a bit on the Latin America market now. Honestly, I don't think Latin is a huge problem, but because there are no huge problems, it merits some attention.It's no secret that this is an under-performing sector of the global aviation market for the past year, which is a shame because it's a region where AAL has a huge competitive advantage. Frankly, I think it is the biggest reason why AAL profits have underperformed UAL and DAL this year.At this point, of course, the real question isn't whether Latin is bad -- that's priced into results -- but whether it's improving at all. As we know, investors overvalue ""improving,"" so if Latin improves a little and helps AAL's yoy RASM number, investors will be thrilled even if overall Latin business is objectively still ""bad.""I saw today that UAL is saying today that business isn't great in Latin America. Did they give any additional info on this?I've actually been flying some of AA's Latin America routes this month and my anecdotal obvervation that business looks OK, but not fantastic. Biz class and premium economy looked healthier than coach, but I can only observe butts-in-seats, and not fares. I don't have enough expertise in Latin pricing to know how airfares are doing; I can just follow the fate of the various Latin economies in the news and assume fares correlate to economic activity. Unlike to Asia, you don't have to worry about competition so much in Latin, because it's quite an oligarchy and, candidly, I think AAL has a sweetheart deal in many markets.And if anyone wants to value AAL on what ""the business is actually worth,"" I am 100% convinced that Miami is a future gold mine. Americans are largely ignorant about Latin America but, jeez, MIA is an incredible asset. Fly down there yourself and check it out (nice weather this time of year). The airport doesn't even really feel like America anymore and, from a business perspective, that's fantastic. I also recommend transiting Panama City on Copa sometime, to see how much economic potential this region has. As I said, 99% of Americans, and investors, have no clue about it."

"American Airlines doubled its cargo-only passenger flights from August to September and operated more than 1,900 flights to 32 destinations.

An interesting read in the NYTimes about AAL's scramble to deal with the crisis. The newspaper still has good reporting when they manage to check their political agenda at the door.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/business/coronavirus-american-airlines.html

Based on history I expect they will miss slightly on revenue but beat in bottom line
"The weather is good in America today. Hooray. Everyone's flights are on-time. But AAL has still cancelled 49 flights. That's only 1%, but still. DAL has cancelled 2 flights. UAL 4. With the MAXes grounded, the airline should be able to fly its remaining schedule fairly easily, no? Aren't there extra mechanics and flight crews? Why should AAL be less reliable than UAL and DAL?"

His ego clearly prevents that."

"Yet another news headline today stressing the ""damage being done"" to the USA airlines by the MAX grounding. Does ANYONE realize that airlines, such as AAL, are actually still GROWING their capacity? The MAX grounding is simply reducing the growth. For years, airlines have gotten crushed on Wall St for growing capacity to much (real or imagined). Logic -- and reality -- would suggest that the forced reduction of growth would not be very bad for the USA airline industry. And, indeed, that seems to be what's happening! Can no one in the media get this memo?"

"$5 stock. Chapter 11 won't happen either, but there will be lots of pain and slow recovery. Its not cheap to have such a large fleet grounded. 12B will be used in no time. Once unemployment hits 10% ppl won't plan for vacations. Covid only just started in the US and until there is a cure and vaccine ppl will avoid crowded places. This economy will not just come back in 3 months. There is too much disruption here. Companies also realized now that not everyone needs to work at the office 5 days a week and those that were operating on low profits find it a good reason to trim workforce. The only good thing I can see here in the next 6 months is that airlines can buy fuel very cheap, but do they have the storage capacity? There is no reason to buy right now, there will be plenty of opportunities on the way down to $5. Until the stock hits $20 again could take 3-5 years with no dividends."
"I find it hilarious that one of the main reasons AAL is down is due to the losses from the4 max groundings (= lower capacity), yet Becker notes that the price reflects fear of a capacity increase from the planes returning. So.....if the planes were never grounded, that implies what? So confusing!"

"AA is erasing hundreds of millions of dollars off the books as it terminates a lot a frequent flier accounts..............this started on December 5. Are the gains since 12/5 at all related to this and do you think as word spreads that taking these miles off the balance sheet will help with further gains ?There's a rumbling in the community of credit card churners, folks who apply for new cards to nab attractive sign-up bonuses before moving on to the next piece of plastic. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has been locking down and in some cases terminating AAdvantage accounts this month of folks who acquired too many loyalty miles through Citigroup (NYSE:C) mailers, in some cases stranding travelers by canceling their awards-based flights.This is a story that has more turns than you'd probably think in trying to sort out the good guys from the bad. It's quite possible there are no clean hands in this mess as the airline giant tries to sift out the unprofitable accounts churning away in the gray areas of sign-up-bonus eligibility. The ""fasten your seat belts"" light is on, so buckle up as we size up the turbulence.The tail of a retired American Airlines MD-80 aircraft.Image source: American Airlines.Flying the unfriendly skiesIssuing credit cards is a big business, and the competition is fierce to stand out. The end result of the one-upmanship is good news for consumers, with great offers to top lists of the best credit cards for 2020. It's in this operating climate that Citigroup has been aggressively promoting its family of American Airlines-branded cards that reward purchases with AAdvantage miles over points or cash-back opportunities.Approved cardholders for Citi can earn as many as 75,000 AAdvantage miles after spending as much as $5,000 in the first few months of ownership, a hefty bounty that can cover the cost of a few low-priced trips. These cards typically include the boilerplate language that these bonuses can be earned only by folks who haven't received the sign-up bonus miles in the past 24 months, limiting the payouts to every two years. However, Citigroup has also been aggressively putting out mailers and online offers for years, and until recently those promotional pitches didn't include the 24-month language.Sniffing out a loophole, churners were limited solely by Citi's velocity cap that OKs just two new approvals roughly every two months. Folks began to create bogus accounts to generate more of these promotional mailings without the 24-month sign-up-bonus limitation, and since there was often no language making the mailers non-transferable, there quickly emerged a marketplace for churners to buy or trade for these potentially lucrative deals.It's easy to point the finger at the churners who were clearly sidestepping the intention of the miles-earning program. Creating multiple AAdvantage accounts for pets or fictional people to drum up the volume of mailers is against the loyalty plan's terms, and a marketplace for these offers won't pass any reasonable person's sniff test of ethics. However, Citigroup and American didn't do themselves any favors by omitting the 24-month language from the promotional mailings and email offers for years. Unlike other banks that tie new card offers exclusively to the promotion's named recipients, Citi's online approval process allowed anyone to change the name and often let several people apply using the same unique code.There's a lot to unpack here. Churners aren't innocent, but they can counter that loopholes and back doors left unchecked for years were baiting them. On the other hand, Citi isn't the only bank with an AAdvantage-branded credit card, but its peers have checks in place to make sure that only real intended recipients are the one applying for new plastic.American Airlines may think it's in the right to cancel flights and zero out accounts that also include legitimately earned AAdvantage miles, but as the hunt widens and the media stories covering the situation expand, the roles of heroes and villains -- and winners and losers -- may become interchangeable.

In 11.6 today and 11.98 yesterday. 7594 shares now. Avg 11.78. I’ll keep buying as it drops more until the vaccine comes out.
TSA data is a positive news for this today!
"My guess but the day Parker resigns, this goes up $4.00 to $7.00.....Kirby at UAL is making mince meat out of Parker with the stock price."
"BRK form 13F AAL down 1mil shares. I really can't think of a reason for making such a small trade, other than ensuring AAL has room for continued buybacks without breaching 10% BRK ownership."
"Financial media seems to be ""understanding"" the weirdness of this stock here. I'm guessing we'll see more buying today ahead of earnings. Tomorrow, the company will have to have a good message. Earnings Day trading is always unpredictable, but when you're at these levels, the path of least resistance is up -- especially since they should have a good story to tell."
"Probably irrelevant to short term stock price moves now, but the industry posted extremely strong TSA enplanement numbers yesterday. We're at Xmas levels, folks. The USA airlines will turn profitable by summer."
"More valuable science: Chinese scientists have discovered that the virus has morphed from a more virulent strain to a less virulent strain. This explains what we've witnessed: terrible infection and death in Wuhan, and not so much mayhem since.7:51 am: Chinese scientists identify two strains of the coronavirusResearchers in China have found two different strains of the new coronavirus circulating in Asia. In a preliminary study published Tuesday, scientists at Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai found that a more aggressive type of the new coronavirus had accounted for roughly 70% of analyzed strains, while 30% had been linked to a less aggressive type. The more aggressive type of virus was found to be prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan — the Chinese city where COVID-19 was first detected late last year. But, the frequency of this type of virus has since decreased from early January, the scientists said."
Still holding 30s soon I’m not going anywhere for a while
"I happened to see a dead-tree copy of the WSJ today. The mechanics union has an ad ""warning"" shareholders that their union won't be ""broken."" I see that Wall St. (correctly) couldn't care less.It will be interesting to see how this plays out. I'm wondering if the company might ask for binding arbitration, as their position is far more economically logical than the union's. AAL wants to buy off existing workers with generous pay and benefits; the union wants to preserve union jobs (that don't exist at other airlines)."

What’s up with airline stocks today again?
Berkshire Hathaway reports its 13F on 2018--08-13 (next Mon) and then we discover if and how many shares Buffet sold.Thank Parker for turning AAL from a good investment 4-5 years ago into a risky gamble today.
Citron Research is a research provider that publishes reports on publicly traded companies while simultaneously taking a corresponding short position in the stock.
I’m in at $25 been a long-term investor so I’ve made plenty of money back-and-forth over eight years into the stock. But I’m willing to cut my losses when it gets close to 20 and then watch it￼

Ok. I had a few nice things to say about Trump's treatment of this crisis at his press conferences early last week. That's done. He's totally lost it again. If you don't understand you can listen to today's conference in its entirety. EOM
AAL is becoming more profitable today with oil now down $1+ on bearish inventory.
Parker downgraded by MS..PT $26. meanwhile UAL upgraded $100+
"if todays price broke down 12.45, and the market turn red tmr，aal might down to 11"
"Down to 10 we go. I cant get enough of the excuses. ""But death rates"" ""But full capacity"" ""But media"" Guys you picked a stock that will take years to recover from this. Not just AAL but airlines. It doesnt matter if they put seats on the wings and they sold out with every other seat. Wave 2 is coming. Lockdown it's going to happen again. Flight restrictions are already being processed again. Bad time to buy. Terrible stock to own right now. I said this at 21 dollars to sell we will see 10 again. Scroll down and look. Here we are. Less then 2 dollars away with news getting worse and worse. Stop living a lie and realize you made a poor investment choice. Will this ever recover to 50? Never. Will it see 30? Maybe in a few years. But the fact of the matter is AAL will be on a downtrend for many more months until there is a clear vaccine release. Until then you will see this trend down."
"Bookings will be sky high and record breaking in the Spring and Summer of 2021. Most airlines have reduced operating costs, labor costs, etc. during pandemic. AAL may be trading in the $30’s in 6 months."
"So to summarize:1/ AAL flies more people for less profit.2/ Parker continues to spend money ($600M) on buybacks at a LOSS, instead of reducing the $25B debt.3/ Despite AAL's massive investment in new fuel efficient planes, it gets no benefit from them."
im pleasantly surprised and happy that Parker bought back 9.9mm shares under $30.
"PAX for current quarter will be as Uncle has projected at around 45% (+0.06-0.07%), or down less than 55% vs 2019.This compared to 4Q20's 36.77%, 3Q20's 29% is quite an improvement.Even, comparing to Jan's 39.35% and Feb's 42.63%, March's PAX will come in around 51.91%.We'll start April in the high 50s and low 60s%, compared to 2019, coupled with higher Load Factor, Lower Costs. The Future is much Brighter, and people are seeing more lights nearing the end of the tunnel.This is no hyping, this is all plain truth, and Uncle only talks about Plain Truth. Uncle won't stand in the way of Doubling Down ""Next Tuesday's Long-Term Shortsters"", most people will stay calm and strong, ignore all the noises."
"Now that we have that over with, the focus should at some point return to actual supply and demand of oil. Until it doesn't again. Anyway happy to be up at all today, but with oil down 1.70 right now wishing we were up a bit more."
"The only airlines stock seller at this price are short seller, cause it’s the easiest punching bag, DON’T LET THEM WIN, BUY and HOLD, these are stocks that still have big room to grow, there’s not much other stock left in the market, almost all of them are overvalued."
no worries it goes up from here
"Kirby helps Parker going Up Big today as he's talking Cash Burn Positive this quarter, this shocks even Doggie DAL which was supposed to be the 1st to announce their Cash Burn Neutral.Take a Big Note so you won't keep asking why Airlines are Up Big Today. This is a Big Blow to ""Long-term as Next Tuesday"" Shorts."
"Today is the first day throughout this whole crisis I'm getting a potential bottom feeling. Mongo insert joke here. The volume and relative strength is pretty remarkable. There seems to be a real battle going on, actually a pretty exciting ticker to watch"
How safe is the dividend??
"Robert Isom on labor:""The task at hand today is really with our association which is -represents our mechanic and fleet employees. And we're working hard to get a deal done there, but we do have other contracts that become amendable and that start openers as soon as 2019 and 2020. And on that front, look, we've done a tremendous job of making sure that we've addressed a lot of the pay disparity for our team. Everybody at American Airlines has benefited from the merger including the association of workers.But as we go forward, as we've adjusted that disparity, I really do take a look at this is a competitive game and ultimately, we ought to be in an era where it's more tied to inflationary gains. And to the point you made, as we get integration behind us, there's tremendousopportunity with technology, with process, with simplification that we talked about and that we've invested in and that it will come to fruition at the time that some of these cost increases are inevitably coming our way. And they will be offset."""

"I FLY VERY OFTEN. I RECOVERED FROM THIS VIRUS. I USED ALL AIRLINES AND NONE OF THEM IS AS GREAT AS AMERICAN AIRLINES. THIS WILL SURVIVE, BETTER DAYS WILL COME AND THERE WILL BE ADJUSTMENTS, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, LONG WHO IS NOT AFRAID RED DAYS, WILL PREVAIL. I BELIEVE IN AAL. GOOD LUCK TO ALL!"
"AAL's estimates have been lowered to EPS $1.19 and Revenue of $11.59bn.Last time Uncle tracked on 9/7 were $1.20 and $11.61bn.AAL is due to Bring BombShell on 10/9, don't know if the longs or shorts will get hurt."

Hey Guys İ have a question for you . Does anyone know what happened to AAL stock holders money when they declared bankruptcy in 2013 and merged. Did they get to hold their shares and gained from the rebound ?
Good earnings call?
"7-day moving average on PAX saw first decline ending Sunday vs previous week, and it's been down 2 days in a row to 1,351,071. The high was 1,445,691 on 4/6, it might have to do with Spring Breakers. The Average PAX for current quarter went back to 59.87% or down 40.13% from 2019.On the Vaccine inoculation last week's 21,889,264 was lower than previous week's 22,504,250, even most States have started vaccinating all adults. There're still too many Americans refusing to get their vaccine, very sad..."
"Back in the USA after an excellent AA transatlantic flight -- the most efficient transatlantic flight I've ever taken (and I've taken well over a couple hundred). Even thought the flight was 95%+ full, we left the gate more than 10 minutes early and arrived almost an hour early. And I see it was no fluke; the airline operated at 90% on-time yesterday. And that's typical of the past week.The attack on the Saudi oil obviously threw Wall Street off its growing realization that it's been punishing AAL stock for no obvious reason, and that the company is actually doing well these days. We're now seeing evidence that -- because Trump doesn't like war -- the USA's response to Iran is likely to be modest (like see today's story in the Hill entitled ""Trump eyes narrowly focused response to Iran attacks""). While it's debatable whether this is a good strategy -- detestable militaristic regimes are rarely contained by diplomacy and economic pressure -- there's little doubt that this strategy is good news for AAL shareholders, at least within an investable time frame. As I said the other day, there is no interruption in actual oil supplies from the attack (the Saudis have plenty in storage), and the Saudis will repair the damage quickly (if there's any truism about oil, is that is almost ALWAYS gets produced). Overall oil fundamentals are bearish: supply exceeds demand. So my best case is that the Market will slowly stop worry about oil and airlines again. And if you're not worried about that, why is AAL so cheap? Of course, the Market could find some other non-AAL specific reason to punishAAL (China?), so the stock is still risky when mood matters more than money."
"Like I mentioned yesterday, when the Nasdaq (with all its tech-heavy, stay-at-home stocks) is outperforming the other two markets, it’s no bueno for travel and hospitality stocks. Unless the gap starts to close, all the shorts will have their day."

"For the first time since March 15, 2020, the TSA number is greater than 1.3 million."
dang I should have sold my airline stock last week and bought again today. so much for hanging on to it for the long run. SELL ON THE HIGHS!!!!!!!!!
"AAL is a disaster of an airline. If you call them to get a refund on a ticket you had a credit on they transfer it back to the credit card without verifying the credit card, during the same call, they tell you that they can't just give you the credit back and tell you that you have to reach out to an online department that simply never calls back. They are dysfunctional. More importantly, it reminded me of how unhelpful they were when I used to fly with them every week. The majority of business travelers are NOT coming back. AAL is badly managed. There are other airlines that will make it through this, but unless there is some serious bail out, which I don't see, AAL has reached the end of its rope. By end of week it will be under 20."
"Closed 2nd Gap of $28.81-$28.97. Now, all gaps have been closed.... We're near 1/17's Pre-Wuhan Virus pricing, after enjoying 2-day Above-$30 window. Based on History, AAL always recovers a whole lot after this kind of ""Disaster"", we just don't know how long we have to wait on this one..."
Didn't I say there would be a small rally an hour ago?
Said it before and i’ll say it again. NO more going under $10. i did say it could of went lower to $7-8 but never did. great stock to own. will add more soon.
I don’t understand why is this not moving like before? I’m boarding right now on American! Super full!!

"XAL, JETS, and DJT are down and airlines with stronger balance sheets are doing worse than $AAL. So you know that suggests the AAL is trading based on sentiment speculation."
Airlines arent going anywhere. We going to start using boats to travel overseas now?
"Instead of sending the over priced airlines money, send $100k to every U.S. citizen over 21 years old. That'll will help more than giving these greedy huge losing money airlines.

"6 Years after AAL/USAir merger, AAL finally is laying off/reducing employees. Normally, companies layoff lots of people after completing merger, AAL is becoming Normal...Don't worry much about the extra $1.8bn low interest loan AAL is taking, they can threaten another mass layoff when it gets closer to election time, maybe the loan will be forgiving?DAL has agreed $1bn in Sell Leaseback aircraft today, something AAL counts as ""Free Cash Flow""."
"this stock is so weird, friday, was all doom, no vaccine, no customers, blowing thru money, BK BK BK, sell, sell, sell and today premarket, big bounce up, was starting to believe the 5.00 buck people."
Looks like AAL wants to go higher. Also looks like possible breakout !
"Buffet likes China stocks, and he invested a ton of his money in to China market. The current relationship of USA and China regarding to Wuhan virus, and will take for months or years to resolve.

Trump is a business man, he will save the airline industry especially American Airlines."

AAL is one of the highest volume stocks being traded this week. Hoping for another bullish run next week!
"I can't speak for all but I have a $17.90 price for my AAL shares. So, I am not in any better situation than some of you. I am not in panic even if there's likelihood for the stock price to go down to $8 range. I should have a low $16 average price per share by the end of the week at worst case and even lower if I increase my shares, which I am not planning to do anytime soon. I am closing down on this stock every week. In the worst scenario, It can go down another $4 within the next a month or two, and may fluctuate around that price range for another month. By then, I should have low $10s average price. How far the shorts will run from me? But, I do anticipate this stock to see mid to high $13 price value soon. Maybe before the weekend."
26$ to close
like if you're still tight & strong holding
I expect tomorrow to be a big day for AAL. It looking to be the day UAL surpasses AAL in market cap. Almost did it today. What award do you think Parker should get for guiding the company from 3rd to 4th place? More shares?

"Delta ASM+5.28%, Load Factor 87.64%, meaning they only need t increase 3.31% ASM to grow 4.5% ASM for the quarter (top end of 4-4.5% guidance).

"What I can't explain is the current fixation with AAL's debt NOW. It seems to me a bit like oil prices: people write about stuff to justify the price, not to predict it. Why was the stock at $50 when, objectively, the ""debt concern"" should have been so much higher? They've obviously shown they have no problem paying their bills and, in case you were worried, they're about to dramatically reduce capex. I'm sorry, but this makes no logical sense whatsoever."
why are these stocks rallying pre-market. Anyone have any insight? Bullish all week.

"Does anyone now doubt that hope is a lot more important in the modern stock market than fundamentals?Looks like a lot of hope to me. The media is massively under-reporting the remarkable worldwide decrease in coronavirus cases. Virus science is terrible, but this is what ALL coronaviruses have done in the past. ""Normality"" may be a lot closer than most people think. Domestic travel is already rising and should surge this spring and summer. I expect AAL to be profitable by Q3. Int'l will take longer to recover, but ""hope"" should keep the Market excited before it does. Maybe by summer we'll have some idea what this company is actually ""worth,"" if that even matters."
"Now, I am gonna scare the Shorts. I am waiting with cash to buy calls. Bring the price down please. Yes, I probably shouldn't have withdrew my sell order @$30 for all my long position at the last second before share price exceeded $30 briefly during pre-market on Thursday. But, I liquidated some at $20 to drop in order to get out of margin. Remember I said over the week a week ago that AAL's share price was going to exceed $15.90 based on the trend of the previous two quarters. The stock price closed at $15.82 on Friday and dropped to $15.02 on Monday. I bought a significant quantity of ATM calls on Monday. Unfortunately, the deeps**t Vlad Tenev's criminal action prevented me making $$$$ which could've paid the cost of a nice real estate."

"Here comes the news that fulfills my other prediction:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-ceos-promise-to-eliminate-dividends-and-stock-buybacks-if-congress-passes-29-b-coronavirus-bailout-175925540.htmlTBTTim4 days ago$AAL conversationIn the last month, I have stated that there was possibly going to be a discussion of bankruptcy protection for AA if the company's shares continue to lose value. Then, I said the U.S. will be in recession over the weekend. Currently, the Trump Administration focused on bailing out the airline companies. The recession enter into the discussion as of Monday. The other two issues I have stressed on a few times since last fall were ending buyback programs and getting rid of dividends. Well, the CEOs of the airlines companies have already said a few days ago that they stopped the buyback programs. The next conversation will be about stopping paying out dividends till some unknown time in the future. I think the administration will make it part of the deal for companies to receive any bailout money. There will be probably a few more provisions in the deal such as limitations in compensation package the executives receive."

just got back from at trip to Las Vegas on AA - planes were full - all had to wear masks - mostly no service except one flt gave us snack bags with bottle of water and snacks - otherwise normal great service -- they were buying seats on a couple of legs - in general most seemed to take all in stridedecent flights were hard to find and I also looked at SW and delta finding less desirable flights with two stops or one WAY out of the way stop - we can normally get direct flights with easeIt appears demand is stripping supply and all airlines will be adding routes and when overseas opens up the sheet will hit the fan with the airlines
Investors I’m telling you the keys to success is to see one year in advance... Seriously think about where the world will stand in 2022... Will the traveling be in high demand next spring??? Will it be the craziest Spring Break ever??? Will people want to drive in grid locked traffic???

"Ever since Parker took control of AAL, everything of value has deteriorated, from profits to valuation.Now at $11.5B in valuation, AAL is 1/2 of UAL and 1/3 of DAL. Parker's greatest achievement has been carelessly running around with a Debt Card like a teenager, buying planes and buyback shares. After buying all these new planes, where's the fuel benefit? After buying all these shares at $40 per share, where's the benefit when shares now are worth the same as before he bought 40% of the company?Instead of focusing on improving profits, reducing debt and dropping costs, Parker has failed AAL shareholders by decreasing profits and increasing both the debt and the costs."
i tell again AAL go to 15 in 3 days and 25 1 month BUY BUY BUY NOW!!!
"Those who read my comments in the last couple of days, if at all, I mentioned about buy/sell volume in various time frequencies and my algorithm table. I didn't do any work yesterday since I didn't have many activities. As a result, I didn't plague any numbers in my algorithm which I have just completed. There has been high volume of buy yesterday even though daily volume was 43.7M and the day's low and high were $15.52 -$16.49, which does not really suggest a high volatility based on the algorithm. Even though price tanked in the pre-market and earlier, i think that was simply a reaction to the recent development in the market, mainly Trump's decision of banning any transatlantic flights with European zone.Get ready for any share price uprise as soon as President make a positive statement. I expect of his administration to give a press conference soon with positive news for the market. Just be prepared. If this stock stays above $14.40, things may improve for AAL stockholders. This is my opinion at the moment."

"For AAL...its a bastien of good news! (please market do NOT look at AAL fundamentals. keep looking at Deltas 8% revenue guide,..PLEASE!!"

"AAL management is doing all the right things, Current share price weakness provides a great opportunity to accumulatehigh level of debt - why would anyone pay down debt when interest costs is so low? If interest rates spike upwards, AAL can just pay them down immediately with its huge operating cashflows. As AAL modernizes its fleet, more passengers would be drawn over. Who wouldn't want to sit in the newer A350 or 787 dreamliners. Newer aircrafts not only offer better fuel efficiencies, they also reduce maintenance costs.high fuel cost - fuel hedging contracts cost a lot and could go the wrong way. Now that oil prices have already came this high, the odds of fuel prices going back down is higher than it going further upwards. With the de-escalation of tensions in the Korean peninsular, the risks of fuel prices spikes are getting lower by the way.high labor cost - all companies in the US are facing this issue. This is not an issue that is just facing the airlines industry. With increased pay for workers will come decreased income inequality. The whole society benefits as a result. Air travel demand would increase if the general population has more cash to spend. With Trump's policies of hiring locals, the US dollar will strengthen as more companies bring their businesses and offshore cash back to the States. And with a stronger USD currency, demand for travel will go up as more people feel good with more money in their pockets.As such, I view the current AAL share price weakness as a great opportunity to accumulate more shares. Irrational fear often create great buying opportunities. Let the company continue to be misunderstood and I'll be happy to buy more shares. Disclaimer: I have purchased more shares on 3rd May 2018 to add on to my holdings."
Lol the market rallied in the last 10 minutes... the market didn’t tell AAL about it
"Enjoying Parker at the helm? While the company has purchased $10B+ worth of new planes, now pays its employees a comparative wage, and has added both expensive & cheap seats and tiny toilets,Parker brilliantly used the new planes to borrow against to buyback 33%+ of the company stock priced in the $40s. Now the stock price lies in the low $30s, the debt ($25B) is at almost double the market cap ($14B), and the market cap is 1/2 of what it was 5 years ago.With the odds of a recession now at 40%, both AAL's debt and AAL's silence (another brilliant Parker idea) is spooking investors."
"HA-AAL-UAL all have BUY Signals, DAL will try hard to get one next after failing 3 times recently."
"BTW, remember why that great Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded AAL a couple of weeks ago? One of his primary theories was ""rising fuel cost."" Brilliant, just brllliant. But, like with so many things on Wall Street, you can be absolutely wrong and still make money. At least in the short term."
$12 is on its way
Even at this price AAL is still at 40% discount
"AAL is steadily rising, it has Nothing to do with the Rocket, it's an Airplane slowly taken off.Uncle has NO Rocket to play, though the little one like UWMC has not been supported By Reddit yet with tiny 30% rise so fart. That's a ""few days Long-term play"" for fun.Uncle has to warn those Druggies, most biggies have come out with their Vaccines, the Street will keep providing negative sheet they could possibly come up with., as they Always do. Just be Careful but not be scared. Airlines are on Simmer mode..."
Parker has repeatedly stated that by the end of 2019 the debt would be $1B less. So soon we'll hear whether that was just another one of Parker's goal that he has failed to honor.
"TSA daily number cross 1.5mln3/21/2021 1,543,115"
Short interest dropped 18% to 141.8m shares for the week of 11/13.
"AA is flying at 75% of capacity, pre-pandemic but stock price is only worth 33% from pre-pandemic price. Room to grow and operating cost has been reduced due to layoffs and early outs. AAL is also stronger domestically, which is on recovery now.Once, London and Europe opens up flying this summer, this stock is taking off."
"What we are seeing today is not only the by product of a looming additional government stimulus by way of a 25 billion dollar airline payroll protection plan, but even better than that, the nascent indications that the flying public is returning to business as usual, albeit with masks donned. ALL GOOD! Set yourselves up for a nice steady rise to the 20-25 arena back where we once belonged (and will again!)"
"Delta Air Lines CEO expects positive cash flow by springSince no one brunged it up.....still on track for 1 April....Easter weekendCEO Ed ""we have cash to burn"" Bastian wrote in a New Year’s Day memo to employees that he expects 2021 to start with travel deeply depressed like it was last year. But as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, he expects a turning point especially in business travel. He says Delta should generate positive cash flow by the spring."
I just bought near 800 shares for the IRA this morning. I like what I'm seeing with AAL moving forward.
Some foreign airlines is now accepting Crypto as a payment method. Are the domestic airlines going to adopt crypto?

"Who would have thought that AAL would be in the twenties circa mid 2019? Mr. Parker also hasn't been heard betting bottles of wine on a $60 pps this year. This is very sad indeed for shareholders and by the time the 737 Max fiasco is resolved the unions will be ready to cry for more, especially the mechanics union. We need to get Mongo on the BOD to stop the madness. However, the harassment lawsuits may go sky high should Mongo get too close to the flight attendants - female of course."
ok... we are close to 5%... we need another 5%????

"(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines bonds plunged to a record low on Thursday as investors continue to pull back from sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus.American Air 3.75% senior unsecured bonds maturing in 2025 fell about 4 cents on the dollar to 85.2 cents as of 12:30 p.m. in New York, according to Trace bond trading dataThe price is the lowest since the bonds were issued on Feb. 20Have dropped almost 15 cents this yearSo just FYI - refinancing debt is currently off the table.

"So in the context of AAL's $30 share price it's meaningless, but there are new reports this week that Norwegian Air is in pretty dire financial straights here. They're apparently about to violate their loan covenants. And, oh, they failed to attend Doug Parker's class on fuel hedging (and why you should never do it) and are probably going to lose more than $200 million this quarter on their hedge (money which they don't have).Maybe the Great Charlatan can tell us what a Nowegian failure could mean to 2019 earnings for the big transatlantic airlines."

"i think this virus will fizzle out by june 1st. people have short memories especially if its not continually pounded into them by the media. air travel will recover quicker than people think. corona at its peak is like a really bad flu season. in order to kill off the airlines you would need about 21 million deaths in the u.s. as some were predicting. if you have some spare change, going long on AA would be a fun bet."
"Dow up 318, airlines and cruise lines down. Oy vey..."
"Ahead of DAL traffic report and quarterly update.Uncle expects DAL to guide higher jet fuel cost, along with higher refinery loss, higher revenue through higher capacity and moderate RASM, reaffirm margin on higher revenue, higher EPS with massive 26m shares of stock repurchase.Not sure if the stock will move higher Monday, but there will be more call buying for those shorts to hedge."
"Beeden the zenophobe, bad for AALTryump said in a White House announcement Monday that the bans could be lifted because of a decision last week by the administration to require international travelers to present either the results of a negative recent coronavirus test or evidence that they had already recovered from the disease. The change would go into effect starting Jan. 26, six days after Beeden usurps office.But Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman(sexist) for Beeden, said the incoming administration plans to block Tryump’s move.“On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26. In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” she tweeted."

We just have to wait a few more days and see how awful it's going to be. iahphx/daniel is persistent if anything."
"Warren Buffet may once again describe airlines as an investment Death Trap as the key players throw caution to wind and increase capacity, expand routes and attempt to cannibalize competitors instead of profitably sharing the space. Investors have been taken to the woodshed and cannot believe the collapse in pps across the sector. The next 6 months leading into the holidays will be very important and certainly the Q2 earnings equally so as each company will need to spin the lower margins and eps numbers and for AAL, its leader isn't particularly good at spinning the message as we've seen so many times. However, let's hope Uncle can see an opportunity for AAL to pull a rabbit from its proverbial hat."
Do you think the stock will go back to 10?I want to buy more...
Today's low 10.77
Shorts will be squeezed like they never have before. This will be the biggest squeezing in the history of short squeezing
"Don't ask me, I don't really know why they trade HA-AAL-UAL like they're one family these days?"
"Does this fuel chart really look like $650 million in extra expense?http://airlines.org/argus-us-jet-fuel-index/AAL does not seem to be doing a very good job pricing to fuel. This is surprising to me, as the industry has oligopolistic structure and everybody needs to buy fuel. Indeed, AAL's newer fleet should be more fuel efficient. That RASM isn't increasing by at least 3% here (I'd honestly expect 5% in this economy) suggests that more could be done."
Will buy below $15!

"President Trump will sign the executive to help airlines industry soon to avoid mass layoff, AAL play good political, Trump does not want or like mass layoff right now because election coming, more layoff for sure he will lost the election. We need to buy a lot more AAL"
Omg its gg to hit $18 - $18.50 today!Should we 1) take profit or2) wait for vaccine appeoval to be announced 3) wait for commencement of commercial vaccines distribution news by AAL?
Don’t fall for the downward price action. Airbnb just easily surpassed expectations in latest QR. What’s the key part of Airbnb? Air of course. Travelers are booking more air travel to get to the Airbnb rentals. AAL is still on track to handsomely profit from increased air travel in the coming months.
Looks like the market really wants to test the recent low of 45.40 before UAL's report....
"Multiple insider purchases reported on AAL investor relations page. Cahill doubled his stake, and an additional purchaser purchased many thousands more"

"I’m extremely new to investing (literally started a week ago) and want to buy airline stocks but I can’t seem to justify the sudden bullish trend with AAL specifically. AAL is the smallest among LUV, UAL and DAL, but somehow has significantly largest amount of debt (33B). With capital expenditures at 4.27B, their free cash flow is -453M. I simply can’t imagine a scenario where AAL survives this with a negligible operating cash flow due to COVID. The total federal $ for airlines is $50 billion so can they really get enough to stay afloat considering 1/2 the money is loans and they will be required to keep some level of operations running? DAL and LUV have positive cash flows in the billions and smaller debt so why aren’t they doing as hot? Am I missing something? Genuinely curious...."

"So if you want abject weirdness, AAL is expected by the analyst community to grow earnings significantly faster than DAL for next year. Also faster than UAL."
"So, as I suspected, it appears the UAL foolishness has run its course. That was the easy stuff to predict. Now we have to deal with oil and, it would seem, the currency market. I know a fair bit about oil -- although, sadly, most of what I know is that you will be unsuccessful most of the time predicting it's price movements. What I finally figured out is that oil is more about the dollar than oil right now, so we have to figure out what will stop the dollar's fall. That is WAY out of my pay level, although I do know that currency is even more ""irrational"" and unpredictable than oil. Again, this isn't likely to be a huge long term problem -- the major US airlines have enough pricing power to adjust fares to match any plausible oil price, and it seems unlikely for oil to truly skyrocket with US production going bonkers."
The Company needs to raise their dividends on a yearly basis and stop the share buy backs and strengthen the Balance Sheet.
"Stock down over 3%, looks like Parker managed to get into the meeting to say something negative about AAL again...Glad they dropped that ""Leap of Faith"" argument from their ""invest in AAL"" literature, hard to back up given how low the stock sits after 5 years of post-merger.Obviously the projected CASM in the future (1.5-2%) doesn't include the cost of borrowing all that money at 3-4%, so hopefully those projected billions of dollars integration benefits will come through and pay the annual debt interest (~$1B)"
Thank god i holded now im + $1300 up
"Option Expiration Day, ALL Day.By the way, it appears that the Good U.S. Treasury is cashing out on UAL and ALK warrants (See their filings) at sweet prices, once they exercise the warrants it adds shares (dilution).AAL, at current price, is probably viewed as too low to exercise at $12.51, ALK's shares price is already more than 2x their ($31.61 exercise price)."
Very good buy till $22- $25 when it's positioned to go beyond $50... don't let it slip... buy buy before institutions do
"AAL at the Sweet Spot?Oil is down big, peers all reported record passengers, the economy is Strong, ALL should be well for Parker logically!"
Hold and ride the rocket. AA planes have been packed as the company was the first to throw Covid protections out the door. Many people are flying and AAs hubs are seeing pre-pandemic numbers. AAs in flight service is back to normal so passengers sitting up front getting first class service again. Watch their revenues over the next few quarters. This stock is going to give LUV and DAL a run for their money.
"Airlines are in slow recovery starting this March, it's going to be a wonderful Summer and Fall...Stay tuned."
This is already above pre-pandemic levels if you take into account the 50% dilution thats been going on during the last year. And the company is fundamentally in a way worse situation than before the pandemic. Should be at 15 at the most

"It's days like today that makes this game so hard. At least the number of people who think AAL is going broke have decreased. :)Two realities. The Market is overvalued here. But everything will be OK.I'd expect consolidation, but no one can actually predict the irrational."
a short nightmare coming up...
What’s the top for this stock
"In this Market, it kind of figures that the day AAL goes into ""beast mode"" and proves the long term strength of the business, is the day the stock goes down!"

OK so I predicted $40 by today...I don't think we'll get it as the market will most certainly sell-off by end of day due to the uncertainty of the Trump/Xi meeting...it's OK as long as we close $41 be end of next week...can we round-up to $40 if it closes above $39.50?...ok? ok?
Buffet says sell and you all follow. Next report he will say he bought airlines again on the dip you made him.
American Airlines boosts flight count after landing new gates at CLT .Boosting over 700 daily flights. Things are really looking bright at American Airlines. A new Mechanics agreement...A new deal with Alaska Airlines. Over 6 billion in free cash flow projected in the next 24 months. The least exposure of all the majors to China with less than 3% of revenue and share buybacks continue at a robust pace.

"So CNBC has this report on the bailout. Still lots of unanswered questions. As a shareholder, I still want to know why the airlines are better off having the Feds pay their employees than furlough them. Because it's the nice thing to do (it obviously is)? I sure hope they're not getting paid 100% of their salaries through summer. That's just not fair to anyone -- except, of course, the employees!_______________________________________________________________A draft copy of the massive $2 trillion Senate rescue package expected to be passed on Wednesday would bar companies receiving federal loans from stock buybacks for one year after the loan is paid back.The massive rescue package authorizes $25 billion in loans to passenger air carriers, $4 billion to cargo air carriers, and $17 billion for “businesses critical to maintaining national security.” It also authorizes up to $454 billion in loans to other eligible businesses otherwise unable to receive credit.

"If they don't think they're gonna die, travellers gonna travel. We're at record high Covid enplanement numbers now. 1,277,000 yesterday. And you ain't seen nothing yet. I'd expect the first 2 million enplanement number in May."
"If you wait to buy airline stocks like AAL until after the recovery, it will be too late. Think of the future but most cannot imagine life beyond Covid. Before, people couldn't image life WITH a worldwide pandemic. Long term buy."
"The short interest was up in the month of June by 16.712MM (13.16%) shares compare to the ending of the month of May. WhenMAQ8 days ago said ""as per today's Bloomberg report shorts reduced their position in AAL, it's a piece of positive news to buy now,""My response was""I would be very skeptical of the report. It all depends on what period he's looked at. Between 5/15-6/15, yes, the short interest reduced by 12.5% (18.35MM). However, the reduction occurred in the second period of the month of May. In the first period of June, the short interest increased by 2%. I would like to believe that the short interest increased in the second part of the month of June as well.""Before that and after the stock price reached $22.80 in early June, I'd said that I did not observe any panic by those who held short interest in AAL and that people should've considered getting in and out of trading since the stock price was determined solely based on speculation and that the stock price was going nowhere. I was more convinced when I found out, the short interest reduced in the second part of May by 12.5% but not during the first part of June, only a mere 2% reduction, while the stock price skyrocketed from the low $10 to over $22.Where to go from here? I have a very small long position and some option contracts expires mainly this coming weekend. I do not intend to do any drastic moves except continue doing day trading for a while until the Q2 earning report. What I have observed over the years of my trading activities is that, there is usually some buying momentum happens prior to quarterly report. Whoever is the upper hand that determines the direction of the stock price, they attempt to strengthen their position (i.e. the shorts in the example of AAL). Therefore, there may occur some buying moments in the coming days which may push the price up a little but not whole a lot up until the day of reporting. Remember the Shorts didn't panic in early June so why should they turn on ""the panic buy"" button now. They'd do it after the report UNLESS they receive some insider information before Q2 reporting day which needs to contradict their own analysis and estimate. Remember the short interest is at its highest level in the last so many years. I have been saying it the buy side has been weak for a long time. I have been observing the same in different time intervals. Each time, there is a strong buy occurring, it is momentary but the sell side is very strong even during those moments. There is no change in the opinion of investors regarding airlines, which is what Bulls need. If you haven't invested in AAL but considering it, it's better to wait until the earnings. Even if you miss a good opportunity, so be it, there is always opportunity in the market including in the airline sector."
"If you've played the swings on this stock correctly over the last couple of months then by now you should be playing on house money. I've played the swings successfully several times now, so the shares I am holding onto long-term are simply profit leftovers. If it keeps going up then I will make more. If it drops back down then I buy back in with my original cash and repeat. You can literally set limit buy orders in the $11/$12 range (pick a number) and limit sell orders between $13 and $14 and make 15% over and over. Don't even need to bother watching this daily...just set your triggers and forget it until they fire off."
"The AA insiders and management have a ton of confidence in the share price of AAL. They have purchased exactly 0 shares since Feb. Not one insider has purchase one share of AAL. I wonder why that is? Why are the secured bonds trading at .70 on the dollar? Why are the latest projected Q2 & Q3 losses bigger than they were projected in April or May? Why is the current enterprise value of AAL higher now than it was in December? Once AAL does have positive operating cash flow how much of that will have to go to pay the interest on their mountain of debt? The last question was a hypothetical question...I don't think AAL will have positive operating cash flow so you can skip that one if you want. Travel Guy, what say you? Any other longs want to take a stab at some of these questions?"
"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest airline would post a loss of $3.92 per share when it actually produced a loss of $3.86, delivering a surprise of 1.53%"

390 million shares traded today...is the SEC on furlough?
"This dip is kinda normal. I holding until 26. In at 17,31. I have bought and sold aal 4 times and made money since the pandemic hit. This is just a game folks. We already know Q2 has to be better than expected. Do not panic"
"Airlines have bottomed as more and more people are vaccinated. The number of passengers and pend up travelers can only increased from here !, Strong strong buy and I am long."
"AAL vs LUV today is a case study in valuation. It's clear AAL is undervalued and LUV is overvalued. They are both airlines and while their business models are different, they both are facing similar cost pressures. AAL earned 5 cents more per share, yet was trading at 56% of LUV's value per share at yesterday's close."
"So I get to post something true and the bottom feeders will contest.Yeah, I bought 23k shares today along with 12k shares of DAL. 30% of my account. True and gonna hav Ed a nice 3 months counting the coin."
"Gov. Wolf to let some Pa. COVID-19 restrictions expire on MondayThe seven-day moving average of newly reported cases was 7,168 on Wednesday, down 19% from 8,827 a week agosHARRISBURG, Pennsylvania -- Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said the additional restrictions that were imposed almost three weeks ago to combat the pandemic will expire as expected on Monday morning.Wolf announced the end of the temporary measures during an early afternoon news conference on Wednesday.Wolf, as of Dec. 12, temporarily halted school sports and other extracurricular activities, closed gyms, theaters and casinos, and banned indoor dining at restaurants in response to the worsening pandemic.The restrictions include an indoor gathering limit of 10, an outdoor gathering limit of 50 and capacity restrictions at retail stores.Some mitigation efforts that will remain in effect on Jan. 4 include:- Self-certified restaurants may open at 50% capacity for indoor dining; Restaurants that have not self-certified are at 25% capacity for indoor dining,- On-premises alcohol consumption prohibited unless part of a meal; cocktails-to-go and carryout beverages are allowed- Serving alcohol for on-site consumption must end at 11 p.m., and all alcoholic beverages must be removed from patrons by midnight- Personal care services (including hair salons and barbershops) open at 50% occupancy and by appointment only- Indoor recreation and health facilities (such as gyms and spas) open at 50% occupancy with appointments strongly encouraged; fitness facilities directed to prioritize outdoor activities.- All entertainment (such as casinos, theaters, and museums) open at 50% occupancy"
"On Tuesday, Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, joined The Final Round and outlined his thesis for a K-shaped recovery. A novel outline for the future of economic growth in an already crowded genre.But in Colas’ view, all these shapes and letters ignore what history says about how the corporate sector recovers from recessions.“Corporate profits almost always make ‘V’ bottoms, and it is market perceptions of those future cash flows that drive stock and bond valuations today,” Colas writes. “Yes, the health of the economy will eventually determine sustainable profitability, and that is certainly important. But history shows the lift in profits after a low is sharp and sustainable for at least 4 quarters and usually much longer.”"
"Another Bear Raid with little damage done, are they thinking that Next Tuesday will different this time?"

"At some point those shorts are going to have to jump in, Because time is Counting down to profitable earnings are on the up swing at the moment.

This Stock is DONE!! lets invest in DOGE COIN instead of this sorry Stock
yeah big money being made and lost here
Flew aal last night. Horrible experience. Inbound flight was late. Outbound was late. Seats were uncomfortable as hell. Employees acted like they didn’t care. But plane was full. Every aa flight was full. This is a pos airline but there is money to be made
The average analyst target price is $17 recommending under performance. So why is the stock still in the mid 20s?
airlines stocks should be flying high!! I wanna see mickey mouse !
We are on the Mr. Market ride today. Nothing at all to do with AAL.
"Do you buy a stck based on value or momentum or both value and momemtum?. AAL valuation is subject to discussion but has a lot of momentun and bring along the valuation desiredas our way of life comes back as used to be, at least have a good icy beer with friend and others."
They open the share high in the pre market and then they sell off..easy money on day trading.... However it seems the market is recovering
"On the charts the AAL has mirrored the S&P, as have most stocks. This morning the S&P bounce off the closing lows from earlier in the year. If this is the end of the sell off (must be an off cousin), it would be a quiet one. I'd take it, but wouldn't be surprised if the market gets a scary flush and then bounces. This is almost a too obvious scenario, so may not happen … the algos must have a trigger to start buying. What it is, we'll just have to see."
Cmon head into the weekend strong!!!
"Airlines going back into lockdown, time to jump ship on this one. Buy again when it falls back below $15. I mean who is really buying here anyway?!"
"Everyone sing with me - Aint no mountain high enough, aint no virus strong enough, aint no riot line wide enough"
Why $DAL jumped 13% and $AAL over 40%?$DAL is echonomically healthier than $AAL. Is the domestic flights news the reason of this superjump?Will Delta have soon a 30-40% rise day?
"American Airlines Groups has 86.31 Million in short interest.I believe we should see reaction again, increased volume yestrday.Let us see the game of the hedge funds today"
Back to $15 thank god i took profits and left!
"Uncle Buffett added DAL, reduced AAL, UAL and LUV."
"I’d point out that aal is going to see a huge windfall in LATAM with a bolsanaro win in Brazil. I sold my Gol airlines stock today with 60% gain and bought 6000 aal today , will buy more tomorrow"
"OK, i am in for this dip, got all day to climb out, and too many things lined up to boost this"
"What did AAL mean by ""weaker domestic yields"" in their Q2 guidance? I've been wondering about that. I thought it was due to the loss of the higher yielding regional flights (and their connecting passengers) due to the IT disruption. Just adding the comment about ""weaker domestic yields"" was a funny way of saying that. Was AAL saying there is something else going on? From a number standpoint it looks like the guidance change was essentially due to the IT outage."
Parker steps down stock will go up 20-25% on the news alone...
gotta give em a little rebound day to get that option money in for friday. wreck all these rebound plays on thursday if we don't get you today.
"Fed Rate cut helps AAL. Not only does AAL have over $5B in variable rate debt, new debt will be added at lower rates than old debt that is being paid down.I'm rooting for the stock to go down at least through 2020 2Q. AAL typically buys back the most stock in Q1. This year, that might be affected by a $500MM 4.625% note due in March 2020. Fingers crossed that the note is refinanced (at a rate closer to 3.75%) and that AAL is able to buy back close to $1B in the first half of next year. 2019 Q4 buyback will be closer to $150-200MM by my math. It's over 1% of the company at this market cap, but nothing compared to the huge percentage that can be bought back next year if the stock just stays low."
"As of 12/15 the short interest stands at 160,823.723, a surge of 13.4% or 18,975,256 in the first half of the month of December. This figure is pretty much the same compare to a month ago since there was no significant change in short interest in the second half of the month of November. #TBTTimT18 days ago""In the first 7 trading days of December, the stock has gained as much as 31.8%. Does that mean there are new AAL buyers in the market? In the past, based on my observation and data I collected, I would have said Shorts haven’t probably reduced their position significantly during the seven days. This is simply because the daily trading volume is higher in parallel to other figures such as price fluctuations in different time frequencies in December."""
Pre pandemic level 30 bucks?
Investing long in AAL
Shorts are selling to drop the stock price! Don't fall into trap. it will fly when market opens.
"AAL flew 21.1m passengers grabbing 33% of total PAX in 3Q.AAL's capacity was only down 59.4%, with 58.9% Load Factor, amazingly good.LUV flew 15m passengers grabbing 23.56% of total PAX in 3Q.LUV's Capacity was down 32.80% with 44.9% Load Factor.ALK flew 3.595m Passengers or 5.62% of total PAX in 3Q.ALK capacity was down 55.1% with Load 48.49%.DAL was too Shy to report their Passenger Number, but their capacity was down 62.65% with only 40.8% Load factor.It's a Shame that AAL still lost a lot of money with very low Liquidity, Very."
"The sad reality is BOB speaks the truth. He HAS for several months. And the apologists just won't face the facts. A lot like AAL management which is wbhy we sit here...NO LONGER the world's largest airline and not a nickel of value creation since the merger. These are the facts. Whether Jonathan wants to quibble over whether we have 966 jets or 956 jets or celebrates buybacks at $40 rather than ,mid-forties.BIG PICTURE--and that's what 3-5-7 is about LONG TERM..we're 1-2-3 utter failure.While Delta and United print money and gain share in the most attractive vibrant macro economy/low fuel/full plane environment arguably in aviation history. Right up there.Its shame what Parker's fone to the cost structure here. Now he's playing games with sideshows to distract us over the 24 jets."
"Unusual options activity yesterday...then today a 8% plus move? I mean PLEASE SEC DO YOUR JOB!!!! There has to be so much manipulation occurring until people start being thrown in jail. If there is no fear of prison, they will break the law, if they make 100 million and get fined 100 million, who cares if the chance of being caught is 10%.....Make 100 million with expected cost of 10 million (10% x 100 million). FFS"
"This is now in mass hysteria stage. There are currently 96,980 confirmed cases. However, because 53,983 have recovered, yes more than half have recovered, there are currently only 39,686 cases. Of those 33,263 have mild conditions. There have been 3,311 deaths since the outbreak back in the begging of December. So in 3 months there have been 3,311 and 3,013 of those were in China. Yet the media as a whole only runs with headlines of “possible” cases and has a headline for just about every cases that is a positive outcome.Remember the Westerdam cruise ship and the cruise ship that was docked in NJ with possible cases on board? Headlines were screaming that it had “possible” cases yet it turned out to not be the case. Did we see the headlines saying that results on those “possible” cases were negetive? Nope. Just one example of the many examples."

back to 9ish soon
Doggie Delta Airlines miscalculated the Strong returning of Passengers and was forced to cancel 100 flights due to Shortage of Staff. They're one-step behind AAL and UAL already on Reopening...
"As expected, Pelosi didn't deliver on airline aid. It was never her intent. She was just working situation for political advantage. A smaller package could has easily passed. AAL was smart to go ahead on the necessary workforce reduction (sad, but it had to be done).Not_A_Short"
ok lets fly aal 12000 shares long
"Parker goes with Kirby again... The Street is bias on AAL, they always bring up debts as if AAL had to payoff every dime of debt s tomorrow. They all have a whole lot of debts, they do, other than LUV and ALK. Only Uncle talked about how they're going to paydown their debts, when they could buyback as well as re-distribute shares as they please. Dilution ain't their concern, survival first and make money back slowly, so stock price will continue to go up and down in longer period of time depending on the companies. The short-term and long-term trend is bullish, the mid-term can be challenging and that's still months ahead.That's Uncle's real view."
"Outstanding!After one whole year of miserable performance, 6 big dogs at AAL gave themselves 1,065,800 Free Shares of restricted stocks, with taxes paid by company via withholding shares. Most got 109,855 shares, except Parker got 414,657, ISO got 211,723 shares."

The 22nd should be fun.
"UAL released 8K withdrawing earnings forecast, estimates fuel benefit will keep 1Q guidance range in tact but can't predict longer term affects. Stock trending down AH, no noticable move in AAL yet."
Just updated short interest and as of tonight it is now 25.47%. Will not be doing the squeeze and all is dependant on the travel numbers and TSA has them at record lows as of yesterday and today

"Airline investors are getting some bad short-term luck with oil prices rising despite a bad overall financial market. As everyone who follows that market knows, short and medium term oil forecasting is 100% impossible. While you can predict long term trends (aka, shale), in the short to medium term, the prices does what it does. I do find it impossible to believe that oil prices will go higher given the US (and, soon, the world's) ability to produce as much oil as it wants/needs at below current market prices. There is no doubt that $65 oil is going to continue the mind-boggling expansion of US oil production. But I guess the market will have to figure that out. The day traders don't care."

"Nothing New, oil is steady, gap between WTI and Brent widen, see if we exported a whole lot last week tomorrow.Buffett is on 45 days to report 13F, no airlines showed SC 13G either. We saw some people wiling to pick up beaten up Airlines today, it's a fair game and fair bet for them."
"I think the big boys have started to load up. I see this trending to $25 very quickly. Based on the chart, a recent pullback already happened and it looks like it found its support today and is turning bullish. IMO it will head up from here. Lot of catalysts are in the pipeline. Stimulus, Vaccine, Holiday traffic, etc."
"Going into Option Expiration, AAL is definitely NOT OverBought Yet!AAL looks more UnderSold than OverBought, Short Sellers are getting chicken lately. AAL only traded 38.28nm shares, way under avg 60.81m shares.AAL's Short Interests as of 2/26/2021 was 76,349,014 shares, it's been coming down from 171,336,981 ended the last week of 2020. It is the lowest volume since beginning of April 2020."
I said you see 14 & 15 before you ever seen 30. I sold at 20. Who held the bag? Who got a taste of the stock market?
"It would be very nice if there was a REAL journalist who could interview Parker and figure out why this company isn't making a billion dollars more than it is this year. Honestly, it defies comprehension. Yes, the MAX grounding is a negative. But it's a small negative -- 2 percent of flying, and the routes cuts should be the least profitable with several other options to carry much of this traffic. Meanwhile, the airline should be benefiting from the industry's overall reduction in capacity (like at LUV) due to the grounding (aren't we all taught that lower ASM growth is great?).Meanwhile, if you happen to look at the GDP number, the price of jet fuel or happen to walk into a airport terminal where AAL operates, you would assume this was The Best Time Ever to be in the USA airline business. The economy is going gangbusters. Fuel isn't dirt cheap (which could actually be bad if lots of capacity got addded), nor terribly expensive. Demand for AAL's flights is insane: I've been flying the airline a bunch the last couple of weeks, and all my flights are sold out and have wait lists. The passengers look well-heeled. If AAL is not covering its additional expenses, why isn't it raising ticket prices? If your planes are full, it seems like you certainly could. No?"
"Load up on all travel related companies. The pent up demand is off the charts, people have saved money because no restaurant bills, shows, sporting events. etc...people have discretionary dollars they want to spend...add that to people working from home n having flexibility to work from anywhere, including a beach, cruise, etc! The travel industry will have more business than they can imagine!!!"
"You Uncle Powell told Uncle to trim some tech stocks and keep financials due to valuation, Uncle won't fight the Fed. Airlines don't have valuation problems, everyone is interested in Post Pandemic ""Future""."
Sell and buy $SAVE - way more profitable. AAL has been on a downward trend since March of 2018!
This is way beyond the joke stage. AAL has a different excuse every week.
"Now they ALL want to talk about PSP#3 as of it were something New!How many cheap shares have they've been accumulating lately?By the way, what happened to that ""Long-term as Next Tuesday"" Short? Still not covered?"
"Uncle remember when you asked me about AAL and AHI.......here is our conversation..........Since you asked, I am recovering from 3.5 days of non stop loving a hot woman named Ahi. She started right in the car and didn't stop until last night when she went back. She is hot baby. Now she is hot and full of Mongo juice Thanks for asking...."

"I haven't heard of much discussion regarding the possibility that AAL has already been discounted for a substantial and extended downturn. I have been through four somewhat scary downturns in my investing career (1987, 1990-91, 2000-2002, and 2008/2009). In each case the investors that took a contrarian attitude were the one that profited the most. In my experience, buying inexpensive stocks which have been driven to absurd levels seems to work the best. AAL is a perfect example. AAL was very inexpensive when this downturn started (about 6x earnings in a market trading at 18x-20x earnings). It has now been cut in half. At current prices you could easily see 100-200% gains within 18 months. Not_A_Short"
"Everyone is thinking abut AAL going $25 or $30 tomorrow; AAL ain't the Rocket company and as a matter of Fact there's really a Rocket Company, the Symbol is RKT and it'll probably be Rocketing too.AAL is current a Wait, NOT a Buy, Sell or Hold which means Sell as well."

"After the Airlines fell big time, here comes the King!""DAL filed an investor update today lowering 4Q18 RASM guidance by 50bp to +3% y/y, the second 4Q RASM reduction in a month. DAL also affirmed the high-end of its 4Q18 EPS guidance, though that was due to lower fuel prices and a one-time gain from the ‘sale’ of a business. Obviously investors are keying in on “good” earnings eroding, as a lower quality mix of earnings is diluting the equity multiple for DAL (and others) while overall estimates probably shouldn’t move much. Though airlines are surely frustrated by the idea, the fact is: it matters how airlines make money, not how much money airlines make. """

"Truth is the street does not respect Parker. Whether it be AWA, LCC or AAL, his company's stock has always lagged his peers.If'm convinced that if the Board got rid of Parker and brought Kirby back the stock would pop $8.00. I bought UAL at $61 to see it rise impressively since Kirby and now over $90 after a 5% drop!"
"AAL's lack of fuel hedging makes a big negative story when fuel price rise. The stock get knocked down as a result. This is somewhat fair as fuel prices have a big impact on earnings. Oddly, when fuel prices fall, it doesn't seem to help near as much. Early this year AAL was trading in the $50s and it began it's big decline to the low $30s based mainly on rising costs attributed to increased fuel prices. Now oil has collapsed to well below early year prices and the stock has not recovered at all. The academics continue to spout that markets are efficient. I don't see that here. I applaud Mr. Parker for not hedging. He recognizes that long term it just adds another (expensive) layer of cost and results in a continual stream of one-time, mark-to-market charges that pollute the earning reports. Not_A_Short"
"This is just pitiful. Flights are full, fuel is down, but this stock just keeps losing and losing."
"Sleepy BofA Securities Lifts Airlines' Price Objectives With 'Travel Rebound in Full Swing'.LUV target was raised from $60 to $68, ALK $72 to $78, JBLU to $19.5 to $22, SAVE from #36 to $37, ALGT from $245 to $260.AAL target upped to $6, UAL $43, HA $18.BofA is Super Bear on AAL and UAL.IT's very hard to look through dead Fish's eyes, Very!"
Passenger traffic continues to grow... yet the stock stagnates. Pure manipulation by shorts. Eventually regulation is going to shut these SOB down. Then they will have to become investors and not bottom-feeding leaches.

"(Bloomberg) -- A Tuesday morning block trade of 3.8 million shares in American Airlines Group Inc. parallels an ongoing strategy that has been taking place since January 4th, when blocks of stock are sold and replaced by bullish risk-reversals.The block of American Airlines shares were sold for $33.50 each, while a like amount of March $34 calls were bought versus the $33 puts being sold.

"""Deutsche downgrades American Airlines, Delta on global market exposure. Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg downgraded both American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) to Hold from Buy. Recent global macro data points ""have been less encouraging of late"" suggesting that airline industry risks are now more biased to the downside, Linenberg tells investors in a research note. As a result, the analyst is finding it more difficult to advocate ""new money"" positions in names with the most exposure to global markets. This drives his downgrade of both American and Delta to Hold. Linenberg lowered his price target for American to $40 from $47 and for Delta to $55 from $66. He also lowered his target for Buy-rated Alaska Air (ALK) to $73 from $75, for Buy-rated Allegiant Travel (ALGT) to $160 from $169, for Buy-rated JetBlue (JBLU) to $20 from $22, for Buy-rated SkyWest (SKYW) to $68 from $75, for Buy-rated Spirit Airlines (SAVE) to $75 from $79, for United Continental (UAL) to $105 from $109, and for Buy-rated Mesa Air (MESA) to $17 from $18.""Really makes no sense!

"Looks like AAL can't get away from the $50 share price, regardless of the awesome economic environment. Parker and his new ""less information to shareholders"" approach can't be helping.

Speculative play for AAL. PFE/BNTX vaccine is on the verge of potential emergency use authorization. If this happens we could see hotel/travel take off big on the possibility of getting Covid under better control. Buy stock or out of the money calls if you believe this news release is imminent.

"If Delta, a supposedly ""well-run airline"" missed so horribly on today's earnings how will a ""poorly run airline"", like American do? All of the airline and hospitality stocks deserve to correct significantly lower based on a justifiably adjusted downward outlook. Without significant government assistance, AAL would have likely already filed for bankruptcy."
It's clear the market isn't giving us credit for UAL's earnings. We really need to have a good report and call next week.
"AAL's dividend policy is not helping the share price. At $.40 per year (1.1%) it is too much below the average dividend level (%2.0) to be appealing to any investor that has a focus on the dividend payout. I realize they must be something (to appeal to mutual funds that require holdings pay out some dividend), but a nominal payout of a penny or two would be sufficient. This would free up additional cash for the buyback (and be a bit more tax friendly for investors). Not_A_Short"
"Would airlines be better just offering flights at cost just to keep the planes in an operational state, and crews actively employed? Many businesses remove their profit during recessions but instead on focusing keeping its workers employed. It may be several years before air travel returns to normal"

Just bought in at 10.30. Stop and think people...33% down in 1 day? AAL is not going bankrupt. The administration has already pledged to help the airlines just like they backed the banks in 2008. Buying now is an EASY 30% gain within a month. Wait till the bailout package is announced and this is going to rocket back up for an initial gain and then a gradual return to normal over the next year as this infection passes. Panic sellers will be left behind or find themselves buying back in higher.

"Trump Says He Will Be Helping Airlines Hurt by Decline in TrafficBy ReutersSept. 1, 2020, 11:55 a.m. ETWASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration would help airlines facing sharp downturns in traffic as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but gave no details.""We'll be helping the airlines. You have to help the airlines,"" Trump told reporters before departing on a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin. ""Airlines are a tough business in good times.""White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows last week said Trump was weighing executive action to avoid massive layoffs at airlines if Congress fails to agree on a fresh stimulus package.(Reporting by Jeff Mason, writing by Andrea Shalal, editing by Chris Reese)"
Parker could have bought back the entire company by now. sub $10bn MC

"To everyone looking at the fact that Buffett sold LUV and DAL but not AAL as some sign of hope, PLEASE know Buffett does not have to report to us any trading activity in AAL under 45 days after the end of the quarter the trades took place, because he does not own 10% of the company. You have no idea what he's doing with AAL, but a good question is, why would he be selling DAL after buying a bunch of it last month 30% higher?"
"I'm sorry, what has changed since Friday?This little relief is a great opportunity to buy Puts IMHO.Cases will continue to spike and a panic is most likely on the way.Think about it for a second.There is a 2-3 week lag time between infections and cases.Then there's another 2 weeks lag till the deaths start to spike.Are the airlines/market most likely going to rally over the next month or continue downwardas the cases and deaths continue to spike?I know which way I'm betting.Good luck."
"Looking at my eTrade analysts opinion, estimate -2.33 loss per share for Q1 2020, -7.99 for Q2, and -3.68 for Q3, with -94.64% drop in year over year revenue by Q4. I'm gonna say that the pain isn't over for AAL longs, and it will get worse before it gets better."
can someone explain why this bk company isn't single digits? I'm confused. thanks
my friend was complaining about being old. i told him don't worry it won't last long.
"...American Airlines ( AAL) says it's received the first half of the roughly $5.82B in payroll assistance it expects under the CARES Act. The carrier says the Treasury Department disbursed the first $2.91B on Tuesday, with the rest due in three more installments through July. American is also seeking a $4.75B loan from the Treasury under another program for airlines established by the government's $2.2T stimulus package. Delta Air Lines earlier today said it received its first $2.7B chunk of aid."

"I am waiting from an opportunity to buy weekly call options today. I wonder if the price will drop to $12.80. I'll try to be patient. if it doesn't, I may buy put option for a quick buy/sell transaction if it goes up to $13.45 region. I still maintain my long position with AAL."
"If anything positive has to happen regarding the stock price, today is the day. For many days, the trading volume has been 27-28MM in the firs two hours. The total trading volume was 33MM yesterday, 5MM of which occurred in the 15 minutes of the opening hour. The volume of options has seen less than 20% increase for the next week which is still very low. We need courages alpha bulls to push the stock price upward."

"Daniel, you are totally wrong, plenty of liquidity means there is no danger of insolvency. Bankruptcy is a condition where Liabilities are greater than Assets and the entity runs out of means to pay it's Liabilities. AAL is in not quite that situation yet because even though their Liabilities are currently greater than it's Assets, they do have the liquidity to carry on doing business. The big question is how long and how quickly business returns to ""normal"". If it takes too long then I'm sorry AAL is going to have to file chapter 11 and it won't even be the first time.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-airlines-files-for-bankruptcy/https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/insolventhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bankrupt"

American Airlines does not engage in vaccine research. Please stop saying the stock will go up when they find a vaccine. Don’t misinform the public please.
"To all those financial geniuses here who posit that AAL should float a secondary to bail themselves out of mess they're in. Kindly allow me to clue you in to some simple facts.As of today AAL's total market cap is $4.7 billion which is roughly what they're going to burn through this month. In order to bring their negative shareholder's equity back to positive they'll need at least $2.6 billion, that's not counting the losses they incurred in April and May, the negative $2.6 billion is from the end of March, 2020. Just eyeballing these numbers they're going to have to sell something like $12 billion worth of stock just to massage their shareholder's equity account back into the green. They have currently 422.9 million shares issued and outstanding. In order to raise $12 billion, they're going to have to sell 1.08 billion worth of new shares at $11.11 in order to raise the money they need. Doing that would more than triple AAL's float. How do you think the stock will react if they actually went ahead and tried to do that?"
Easiest money I’m ever going to make.
"Seriously people, can any airline in America turn a profit flying at 13% of capacity?"
"Robinhood’s stock restriction list is down to only 8, and AAL is not one of them. That means we are free to trade. AAL’s stock price was around $16 before short squeeze began, so it doesn’t seem to have a lot of downside risk. https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/"

"I just want to apologize to everyone this Coronavirus is a once in a century event. In the matter of a couple of weeks it has absolutely thrashed the world. The fear of this is also exponentially worse but man this is fear begetting fear in ways unimaginable. This is just a few weeks ago from the discovery. SARS infected 7000-8000 cases man do I feel silly for thinking that could be a comparison as they say hindsight is 20/20. I remember being in NYC on 9/11 and seeing the people there thinking the world was ending but that only happened for a few hours this has surpassed even that and it continues. Iahphx there is panic shopping going on here and signs have posted signs ordering strict limits on all kinds of general products bleach, water, paper towels, etc. This is fear in a tremendous way. Having said all that I’m looking to acquire more leaps I’m just trying to calculate the best way to play it (price, strike and quantity). Yes I remain a bull I believe in this company and in Parker."
AAL will join the GME KOSS AMC BB BBBY club again tomorrow. Last time AAL was in the same boat and hit $30 if you remember still.
This stock was trading at 58 dollars in 2018. It is not unreasonable to presume this will ride as airline travel resumes especially with people cooped up for over a year!!!
"It's certainly concerning that oil is up today. This is reminding me of the 2014 oil market where ""everything"" is bullish and everything that is clearly not bullish is simply ignored. The big difference between now and then though is the Permian. Can the speculators really ignore the virtually unlimited oil that will now be produced in the USA? I have no idea; remember, this isn't rational. I do know that, eventually, that market will crash, almost certainly some time this year."
Got in at 19.50 dont know what I was thinking.
"People are starting to notice AAL... after skipping over Uncles and Mongos, they can see the improvements AAL has been setting up for the future. This is gonna be the stock to own for the next couple of months. Is 2020 ready for 40's again? Hell, is 2019 ready?"
"OK OK, so I started accumulating the shares at low $30s right after the 3rdQ 2018 report when Parker outlined the roadmap that includes declining capex, $300M cost savings and $1B revenue improvement for 2019. So when I found out later that two directors (insider trading) increased holdings, one for 53% increase costing $836,763 @ $333.47 on 10/29/2018 and the other increasing this holding by 25%, costing $535,301 on 11/19/2018, these two purchases being made after the 3rdQ report, well I was happy knowing two directors saw what I saw. But, but, why hasn't there been any buying from the CEO Parker and CFO Kerr at these low prices? If Parker truly believes AAL share price is undervalued, hence, the buybacks, why isn't he buying for his personal account? How about kerr? How about Isom?"

Don't care if the Street likes it or not, Uncle likes it."
"I don’t know how could Trump can give away billions free. Anything to bail out the airlines will be like AIG, Fannie, Freddie or GM style.They can provide interest free Loans and concessions on Taxes but nothing more.Gl!"
Should i buy more?About 10000$But hm... i am worrying about going down....
All I see is a bunch of hope investors whom are mathematically deficient. Show me when and how positive cash flow can be achieved. Hope investing is not an executable plan. Might as well go to Vegas with that mentality
Great BUYING opportunity!!!!!!
Parker sees himself as equivalent to Gary Kelly at LUV in the dual role of chairman and CEO...problem is that LUV is worth twice AAL with half the revenue.....I do not understand why the major AAL shareholders aren't taking action to change the status quo......surely the shareholders deserve better than this? Kirby is not the answer as CEO.
Oil tanks yesterday and AAL tanks....oil slight uptake today and AAL tanks....the algorithms have a special subroutine called Parker 
United and DElta are not shorted. ONly American Airlines is shorted.

"American Airlines expects to receive $12 billion from the $2 trillion stimulus package, passed into law Friday. The government expects to be compensated for any aid, which makes the situation complicated for investors. But given the severity of the Covid-19 downturn, the cash is good news for all airline stakeholders."
"Gentlemen’s This Fort Worth, TX-based company operates flights to multiple destinations across the globe. The company, like most other airline operators, is witnessing a revival in passenger revenues on a spike in air-travel demand. Moreover, the company's cost-control initiatives are aimed at driving the bottom line despite the prevalent challenging scenario. Boosted by its cost-saving efforts, American Airlines succeeded in reducing its daily cash burn rate from nearly $100 million in April 2020 to approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2021. Moreover, the reading related to domestic load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) was nearly 80% in the first quarter, further mirroring the recovery in air-travel demand. Management anticipates booking strength to continue through the second-quarter 2021 end."
"Vaccine inoculation appeared to be slowed down, even most States have open up for public vaccination. At current speed it'll take us to 5/27 to have 200m adults vaccinated, hopefully we can start vaccinating 12-15 kids soon. Government has to be more carefully delivering vaccines according to Demand and Supply, not by population of States."
Covid numbers are declining at an excellent rate. In a month all flying restrictions would be off. There is real hope.
"All right ladies and gentlemen I need some feedback here. I’m new to the stock market and have several shares of American Airlines. I need to make some money, should I hold onto this stock? Or go somewhere else with my money?"

"This is a $5 stock. All that is keeping the price up is ""the castle in the air"" thinking of most believing stock markets will just go up and up; dow 30K by end of April.The bail out money comes with strings attached, most likely no dividends and it will take years to recover. That money is peanuts to what is needed. Nobody will fly for months to come. It must be a daytrader's dream but going in now hoping this will see 20 again anytime soon..."

Parker: Give it up. It take s a big man to admit 3/5/7 was a colossal failure. You have lost all credibility with Wall Street and investors because of your blatant business miscalculations: quite simply you over promised & underdelivered.You have given away the store to the Unions—you blinked.

Johnson and Johnson will likely come out soon with the efficacy of their vaccine and we will see travel this summer like we have not seen in years. Lots of pent up demand to travel. Problem is that airlines still have a lot of credits for tickets cancelled earlier in the year. Still not a bad time to get back in as these stocks are forward looking.
AAL closed at its high of the day... very good sign of conviction from investors. Next week will be a great week as more states open up for business.
"Field Report: Flew on a domestic AAL flight this morning. Completely full. I saw one person put on a mask. Watched CNBC and CNN on-board. Both channels are barely watchable (CNN probably isn't watchable; care for some bias and panic between your commercials?) Cramer's logic on CNBC was a bit odd, but useful, since he's obvious a ""voice of the trader."" He's telling people to sell their travel-related stocks for the opportunity to buy the usual overpriced stuff like Apple, which I guess is down to a multi-month low. He says the virus threat will pass later this year and the world will return to normal. I'm not sure I understand why I'd want to buy a slightly less overpriced stock when I could pick up other S&P 500 companies that are priced like they're going out of business because there are a couple dozen dead elderly Italians."
"AAL should be doing better than it is today with the market up, oil down and enplanements (literally) flying. But this isn't a very predictable game."

"Be honest guys, do you genuinely think it will be going up more even to 30$+? (Don't be bullish just for the fact that you have shares and you hope it go up back to the moon.) Notice the enormous debt they have to pay and the fact that they don't make money at that moment. I also have shares and I was very bullish of the stock price but now I am a bit nervous of it. I would appreciate everyone disagreeing or agreeing with me."
"My feeling is Airline stocks are now Buyers' Market, as long as people are willing to put in a bid, at very unreasonable price, the dealers got huge inventories to sell you.

For what it's worth.. My wife works for a major airline and all of her friends she's met over the years do as well of course. Over 50% of the calls in reservations are now concerns about Coronavirus and so many people are canceling flights. One of their international flights today to India only had 10% capacity on-board... 10%! With more cases rapidly coming up daily I don't think airlines are done taking a hit unfortunately.
"Now the stock goes up every day. Absolutely nothing has changed at the company, or its fortunes.Of course, this is too easy. I'm ""expecting"" something bad to happen. Not that it will, of course. But given what AAL investors have been through, it's impossible to believe this can be easy."

"If this stock loses another 15%, at this point it's very likely, we will be talking about debt crises and possible Chapter 11.

AAL appears to go in the same direction.I stopped adding more of AAL shares last week. I have placed a weekly Covered Call on 80% the shares due Friday. I wish I had the balls to ask higher premiums. It was in mid $20s at the time, I don't think this is going to $24.50 by Friday."

Sanity returning to AAL pricing. Hard to believe last week on Thursday the stock traded below $29. I added a few shares and now wish I had been more aggressive. Hopefully we see $40 again in the near future.
"King Fish has Higher expectation all the time on earnings? or He thinks earnings don't matter, all guidance must Exceed his expectations to be ok? He's never talked about what he expects, maybe only to his clients? I doubt it.""JBLU and LUV filed investor updates today (12/12/18) with fresh 4Q guidance. LUV affirmed everything except for fuel, which it took down by $0.05/gal, and JBLU tightened TRASM guidance by 50bp at both ends. Our estimates are unchanged. Both updates were in line with our expectation, though JBLU lowering the high end of the RASM guide by 50bp perhaps could be taken as a very slight negative, as we think most expected the high end to be maintained. For context, our prior 4Q TRASM estimate for LUV was +1.6% y/y and our prior 4Q RASM estimate for JBLU was +2.6% y/y – we keep both of those estimates unchanged."" - Mighty Kind Fish!"
"I am super angry!We were NOT prepared, we were too ignorant, this whole thing doesn't have to come down this way.We knew all these since early January but Trump kept treating it as a flu. Its too arrogant, it's too ignorant, we've seen how Taiwan prepared for it, we've seen how S Korea dealt with it. We paid too much attention to China's Fake numbers, Uncle has also warned how they cover up their cases and death. We could've ordered private companies to start producing masks, protection gears and Ventilators months ago, we're still telling people that they don't have to wear masks if they're healthy, worse, we allow people attacking people who wear masks. You DO wear mask if you have one when you call shopping, riding subways, visiting hospitals. Of course, you wash hands more frequently.Again, old people stay home, there's no need to go out at all, it will be hard for people living in apartments in New York, but that's what they really have to do to avoid community spread. Younger people can still get infected, they'll recover faster. Give New York all the ventilators they want, they'll need a whole lot of them with increasing testing..."

"$AAL - BE CAUTIOUS In the coming days and Don't Let The Fat Man Eat Your Food!AAL's institutional put-to-call ratio is around 2.36 as of 2/24. However the call-to-put ratio is 2.6 for 2/26 and 2.1 for 3/5.While conformists believe a higher call-to-put ratio indicates a bullish sentiment, contrarians think it is an indication for a bearish sentiment. In contrast, conformists think a higher put-to-call ratio is an indication for a bearish sentiment, contrarians think it is a bullish sentiment.As you see institutional investors appear to be bullish on AAL. Those puts are for protective hedging. However one can not say the same for the upcoming weekly options unless one starts tracking them ahead of time. It may be a lot of work but always keep an eye on open interest(OI) and fluctuation of volume and OI if you want to know the recent developments in the options market.Friday hasn't quite been generous to AAL long position holders. I've been leaning towards a bearish Friday however the share price rose on the last two Fridays compare to the previous trading day. It was neutral on one week, and down in four weeks since the start of 2021. The trend has been positive lately. So $AAL may close the week on a positive note.I am still long in AAL. I was forced to liquidate all the shares I was assigned through options in the last two weeks for a sale price of just over $18 last week, and then $20.65 this week due increased margin requirements which I wasn't aware of at the time I bought the calls. With them, I would have increased my previous position by 150%. Meanwhile, I've moved the expiration dates two weeks closer, 3/05 and 3/12, on the covered calls 3/21 and 3/26 while I've also increased the strike prices for them. I want to keep those shares since I bought them at low $12s and I'd like to avoid paying higher capital gain tax. No offense to any bullish traders here but I'd like to see a 6% to 8% drop in share price before the expiration of the options.I prefer short term short puts, and covered calls over long calls. AAL long puts makes me nervous and I have not enough $$$$ for them.**ALWAYS DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE**"
this is BS... it's still in RED
"Real market open is a lot better than pre market. Overall earnings expectations needed to come down, and they did. Disappointed no one is talking about or asking about recouping losses from Boeing. Moving on! AAL resumes buying back shares next week."
Next week is the disaster for AAL!
just bought 30 more shares
Phil LeBeau said yesterday the airlines balance sheets are much better than past years but thought he said AAL is the weakest. I don’t follow this company but find it a compelling since it’s come down significantly. Any thoughts from more experienced followers? Thanks.
Without airlines us will collapse and then where do shorts go to spend their short sighted gains. Airlinemust succeed.
when we going to reach $30?
"64129 shares of aal accumulated over last 3 months. Too many potential upsides including airline bailout, fiscal stimulus, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. With over 40% shorts, Monday looks good."

"Airlines will come back before cruise lines. Why are airlines socks down and cruise lines up? WB knows that his unload of airlines will greatly affect the market but look, AAL is only down as much as DAL and less than ALK. None of us is as big as WB, this is an opportunity for smaller investors like us. You think Trump will let the only airline carried American name to be wiped out of the earth?"
"The current set-up for earnings week looks promising -- decent market, lower oil. That said, given this volatility and illogical market behavior, you'd have to be a risk-taker to place a short term bet."

"I think I'm going to sell my $40 Jan Calls today at about a 65% loss. Worried the time frame AAL to perform has been extended here, and they will trend to 0, and that any performance in AAL will have less and less of an effect on these options going forward (as theta eats away are option value). I am prohibited from rolling the options as I cant sell and buy the same name within 60 days. Any opinions?"
This is the same stock i bought in 2011 for $5.89 and sold it 3 years later at $34.18. This is how you make money in the stock market during recessions. Oil stocks should be bought here also. you will be glad you did. Buy what Jim Cramer (Mr. Flip Flop) tells you to sell. I make $ every time!
yes! $30 soon!
"The airlines in long term would great. This is a good time to retire the old planes and get more efficient planes. They need to write everything off now. With 737 Max being re-certified and I am sure they will be very safe planes going forward. I had taken them multiple times (may be lucky), but they are great planes, after this defect has been addressed."
"White house signalled a third relief bill aimed at airlines. Vice president said airlines are the worst hit on this Wushi virus. Mnuchin said on Saturday US will go any far to support Airlines because of the wide role they have on US economy. American employs over 100,000. UAL and Delta already announced they are in talks with the administration for relief, no news from Parker. He did say he anticipated this and has the capacity to weather through 2021. Do you seriously think the airline ban will stay on place for more than 3 months? millions of jobs require travelling, economy can't sustain without overseas travel.Buffett also stated today he have no plan to sell his airlines stocks. Only the tough ones can weather through this storm. We have to put faith on Scientists. They will make a vaccine available within 18 months. I believe the nations will join hands and the great scientists across the world will come together and work together aggressively towards a vaccine. In the mean time, once we have test kits that give results within an hour and if we can cook these price into the airline ticket offset by cheap oil, airline industry can make a come back."
"look up the wuhan level 4 bio-safety lab in china. it is the FIRST level 4 lab opened. it was opened jan 4 2018. it has an airlock entrance with neg air pressure to keep contaminants from escaping. it was set up to study highly pathogenic viruses like ebola and sars. and it is NINE MILES from the original site of origin of the corona virus. it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened here. they cooked up a biological weapon to be used in warfare to debilitate an enemy army. some lab tech didn't follow protocol and left the lab contaminated with the virus and went shopping. china would not release it on themself, so it had to be an accidental escape. hopefully analyzing the dna will shed light on whether it is a man made virus. right now i chalk it up to dumb people playing with fire."

The financial impact could be huge. That's $20 RT … is that a 10% increase? Let's say only 5% … could be up to an extra $2 Billion/year. However it is hard to say if the up-sell tickets will have the same increase. Lot's of factors and ways to estimate the impact. Nevertheless, it is material.Probably, AAL will no longer be a ""broken"" stock."
LOOOOOL Lost all gains!!!
Hate to say this but it will get a lot worse before it gets better. Market going to low 20s and aal to $20
It’s matter of time. Once vaccine is there everyone will fly again. American Airlines is an Iconic name.
If UAL is $19 then it implies a share price of around negative $5 share for AAL or worse.
"That early retirement offer last week to the senior pilots seemed generous to me. I guess it was: apparently more than 500 pilots decided to take early retirement!

Great action today finally. It looks like we have a buyer or buyers hitting all the bids today. With overall market strength faltering this afternoon there is little sign of that in AAL.
"Uncle's After-Hour Report:Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines initiated at Citi Citi initiates the U.S. airlines sector, says Delta is top pick. Citi analyst Stephen Trent initiated the U.S. airlines sector in a note titled ""Initiating coverage: Pick Your Routes Carefully."" The analyst initiated Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) with Buy ratings, Southwest (LUV) with a Neutral rating, and American Airlines (AAL) with a Sell rating. Trent said that Delta was his top pick, citing attractive revenue diversity, relatively smooth earnings streams, and solid alliance networks. Trent is Neutral on Southwest as he believes the company's valuation relative to growth, along with 737 MAX risks, put the shares near fair value. The analyst has a Sell on American Airlines due to the company's high leverage, 2020 MAX redeployment, pilot contract negotiations, and valuations concerns."
Just the usual low volume shorty stop loss shopping. Yawn.
BANKRUPT SOON! <3
AAL is not an Oil Company.
"This AA Stock have to go up, its American airlines, govt will support, the way Air Canada is getting subsidy support by Govt upto 70 %, there airlines chances to get bankrupt is very less, all fumes are due to one person decided to sell shares. As per the US, they are not closing business like canada, its seems they will open flights shortly, may be in 15 days or max by months, bigger picture, oil prices USO is going up and NAT price going down of storage, Plans seem like to get the OIL in cheaper price and then open economy to use that oil. its seems like all plan........wait n watch the moment. Air Canada already announced all the travel should be with mask and if its short flight there will be no food will served on the aircraft. this all fumes, take a wise decision 100 % its a time buy this stock, some people create panic. to play with market. thats what its happening. wait and watch......... the moment announcement going to come for travel,.. things will change in hours, they cannot hold everything for long. India have announced already 33% employee from each company can start working, and most of the countries following their path in regards to lock down and precaution parameters. Their is no way govt can provide more financial support to people. Calm down and think about it....... some people creating panic so u can sell the price go down and they can buy in tons......and these debts and balance sheet are all in the market from the long time......... and all airlines facing same issues rightnow...... if someone trying to tell me all the major airlines go bankrupt with taking people travel credit and all the money............... its feel like dream world....please be kinds save your money, 100 % this is a time to buy the stock......... people will create panic....."
"Good volume, holding into close. If it can run tomorrow i can see this starting the squuueeeezzzee"
"Two things to talk about. 1. If the rumor is true that new $1.9T includes a $14bn package for the airlines, people in the know would take pre-empted action before everybody knows, so watch how the airline stocks move especially unusual bigger than usual buys.2. BlackRock has been added holdings to its portfolio, information can be found by logging into your brokerage account to see news. Old Ownership is on Nasdaq website under institution ownership, when pulling up individual stocks.3. Vaccine distribution and administration are irregular, but States are supposed to get promised Weekly distribution in total, some days less or even none, some other days more. Administering Vaccine should not slow down based on less single day delivery, which happens to be the case, keep administering as planned."

"Looking forward short-term for legacy Airlines...With 2Q earnings out, we've seen excellent performance from UAL and its bullish forecast for their 2H and full year, Delta also gave their view for 2H, except they saw Oil Ghost for the immediate quarter with shocking $2.34/gal guidance for their 3Q when their 2Q fule excl refinery benefit was $2.21/gal, compared to UAL's 2Q fuel of $2.26 and 3Q guidance of $2.21.Something Delta has to clarity on their July traffic report?In the meanwhile, the Dead Fish has just lowered their 2Q and 3Q EPS estimates to very pessimistic $1.59 and $1.37 as if somebody just died? AAL did guide $2.21/gal fuel cost for 3Q same as UAL, so what's going on in the Fish community really beats the sheet out of Uncle.AAL is currently trading for $38.5 and DAL $53.01, the price spread is new high of $14.51, in percentage it's 37.69% lower, the leak was 39.64% on 7/12 when DAL was at $50.73 and AAL $36.33, spread of $14.40. Very weird, Very!"
"As long as the government does NOT ground the airlines the rebellion Americans will travel, you can't stop people from family reunion, my niece has come back from New York and is staying in Airbnb for one week to quarantine herself. Anyone with older people at home must be extra careful, one week quarantine ahead of Thanksgiving or even 5 days will be enough. Uncle is Ready for the Holiday."
"Oh my, that's a savage drop considering this was $30 in premarket at one point. Retail playing with fire and getting torched.PS: I'm long AAL, but I can only be supportive of sustained moves. Since I'm not a day trader, having a stock pop 50% one day and down 40% the next does me no good."
"Daniel, liquidity is not equal to equity, all that so called available liquidity needs to be REPAID. Where's that coming from? That liquidity you're talking about is all borrowed money, it just makes the equity hole they're in all that much harder to climb out of. Thank you for letting this board know you know nothing about AAL's finances, nothing at all.When AAL says something like ""we have $3.2 billion in undrawn lines of credit"" means they don't actually have $3.2 billion cash in the bank. They're just saying that if they max out their line of credit (very similar to the credit card you have in your wallet) the can come up with $3.2 billion BUT they don't bother to say that money needs to be repaid and in order to repay any of it they need to be cash flow positive FIRST, which right this very moment they're very far from accomplishing."
Everybody I know is closing account at robin and move to real brokers. Allowing 5 shares for each only happens in North Korea.
"Again strong TSA3/16/2021 1,088,816"

"US govt will never let this one fail, the stock will double within a year"
"Interesting that today's report shows that DAL reduced capacity in Latin America by 6% yoy. That's good for AAL because of AAL's dominant position in that market, which is now outperforming other regions. Don't feel too sorry for DAL, though: they're taking advantage of the MAX groundings by their competitors to make bank on domestic flying. DAL is the only one without MAXes -- a lucky break."
I PROUDLY voted NO for every BOD nominee at AAL. I wish I could vote NO TWICE for Parker.
"Here is my opinion feel free you oppose if you want. I don't think a bailout is coming I hope I am wrong. It seems politicians forgot what they said last month about a second stimulus. Today they are voting to approve an new stimulus but it doesn't include any help for airlines. Even though a bailout is not coming, I don't think AAL is gonna drop futher. Worst case scenario I say 12.80$ this month. On the other hand demand is growing and more flights are opening as we speak. This should keep airlines rising a little more."
If this company won't go bankrupt which I really doubt any airlines will. I see this as a med risk high reward play. Possibly a strong long term hold for a couple years. Any feedback thank you
American Airlines is entirely dependent on communism; so is Boeing which is entirely dependent on the mechanisms of communism. Monies are funneled to American Airlines and Boeing from your tax dollars keep people employed and Executives paid that would otherwise been unemployed. American Airlines is not a vehicle you can invest in because there's no price Discovery in the stock because there's no company.
I suspect Greg will soon announce he bought back at $31.
I'm in about $150k between me and two family members accounts since the mid $12s. Not complaining. TSA numbers 1 million by next week. Lets go
Let's shore up AAL to the level used to be. Other airlines have very low short ratio but this one is highest in airlines
Drop coming after earnings
Why does American Airlines keep cancelling flights instead of delaying the flight when a thunderstorm moves through? Most thunderstorms last less than 45 minutes. Is the airline just trying to steal the travelers money?

"as it is now, someone is buying actively, maybe run up soon?"
I would eliminate the dividend & stock buyback. Hedge fuel for the next 2 years. Start paying down debt. Pull a George Costanza do the exact opposite.
"-I haven't checked the margin requirements lately since I receive automated e-mail from my brokerage firms anytime there is change in margin requirements. Today, I was browsing their website and I noticed the long position margin requirement for $AAL was raised to 75% while the short position margin requirement was increased to 200%. They have been always around 30-35% and occasionally 40%. -Moreover, borrowing cost for short position was 42% last week, which dropped to 36%. The last part doesn't make sense but whatever....(it should've been the other way around).-Also, supposedly, short shares availability increased from 2.5M previously to 5.1M this week. I don't really know what that means. I am pretty sure more AAL shares are available for shorting particularly when the short interest stands around 15%. -When the volume and share price move in the same direction (down in this case) and stays around there for a certain period of time, from where I stand and observe things, I would say possibly some short covering is happening. So, yeah, that may explain the increase in the availability of short shares in the last week. -However, I think it's been rather challenging for the short-sellers to further short this stock in consideration of the information I have shared above. If there is no mishap in the market in the coming days, it will be really a costly attempt to push the stock price down. Having 100M of shares being shorted currently @ 40% fee means the shorts need to cough up 2.05M daily, $14.38M weekly, $62.45M monthly.Loosely speaking, If we look at the fluctuations in short interest, it really moves within 10% range in a month, and maybe 5-8% bi-weekly. Sometimes, there is hardly any change in short interest. Let’s assume and say that there happens a 10% reduction in short interest bi-weekly, the shorts need to force the stock price down by 15% minimum to brake-even, if they succeed it in a month, you need to double the percentage. At $17.80, I am thinking the stock price need to be under $15 and if it is a month, that's way below that. That is why we have daily price fluctuations and intraday surprises-big ups and downs (day's high - day's low). I don't care how smart the higher frequency AI machines I am trading against. It is in a disadvantage position against a Reddit army. The question is, can they be mobilized if they knew this? If 8 million Reddit army were to buy 20 shares tomorrow, all you have to ask is ""how high can $AAL price jump?"" Will short-sellers be shorting another $3B to $5B worth of AAL shares?Let’s just hope market stays positive until we gain some more."
"I find it rather strange that AAL share price has dropped 19% and closed with over 11% gain. The share price soared as much as 33% between its lows and highs, a straight forward with occasional large drops, during the day. All this happened while all indexes performed terribly, lost value in double digits, 10-12%, and the market had its worst day ever since 1987. For God’s sake, S&P 500 has lost 12% on the same day! We all know AAL has been one of the weakest airline stocks for a long time. We all remember how AAL share price usually lost twice more than the others on a down day, and gained half as much on an up day. AAL breaks daily trading volume every week. 85M shares have exchanged hands yesterday. It is one-fifth of the entire floating shares. Ask yourself what has changed about AAL yesterday? Has the market conditions changed for AAL favorably? Are we over with Coronavirus yet? Did people start traveling back again? Do the airlines running in full capacity again? Have the travel bans and restrictions with EU or other regions removed? Why is the share price up, then? You can provide two main answers: 1) The Trump administration is the AA’s back? The company can borrow cheap loans to make its payment on time. Did you say a bail out is near? How likely is it that AA may go bankrupt? Oh, it’s just a precaution. That’s all right! I heard a recession will give a visit to Fed. Again, why is the share price soared usually high yesterday?2) Well, the whole thing you mentioned in “1” encouraged new buyers. The stock is really cheap. Now, the price is down, e/p and dividend ratios will be appealing to them. Fair enough! I wonder why 85M shares were sold yesterday, then!?! It was the Little Joe who owned all those shares! Well, Shorts also bought plenty shares. I see! Who did they buy them from? The Little Joe? I thought he is called the Little Joe because he doesn’t own many shares. Although I still wonder why it happened, I don’t buy it!"
ALL to $20 after FDA approval!
Bear hunting season is open!
"If you want to make a lot of money, do the opposite of what I do:) I am still holding AAL, not sure if the government will ever allow life to be normal, now that Fauci wants us to wear 2 masks, but I definitely want to fly AAL to board a CCL!"
"CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.5:03 pm ET January 28, 2021 (CFRA)We lift our target price to $22 (from $19), 55x our 2022 EPS estimate (cut to $0.40 from $0.98; 2021 to #$%$96 from -$4.61). Q4 adjusted EPS of -$3.86 vs. $1.15 beat consensus by $0.27. Q4 revenue fell 64% Y/Y, which was roughly in line with peers Delta (DAL), United (UAL), and Southwest (LUV). These three peers all reduced the largest airline operating expense, employee compensation, in the range of 30-34% Y/Y, though, whereas AAL's Q4 comp was down only 17% Y/Y. We think this exemplifies the historical norm whereby AAL is much less efficient than peers. This drove it to produce the largest adjusted operating loss among U.S. airlines in Q4, even though it had the most revenue. AAL also has the riskiest balance sheet, with net debt of $34B, vs. $22 - $23B for DAL and UAL, and net cash for LUV. From a fundamental perspective, we estimate AAL's equity value materially below current market cap. But we remain at Hold as positive momentum combined with high short interest could cause shares to keep rising."
"I find it very weird that Wall Street is acting like the USA airline industry is a bad or troubled business. Do the people who trade these stocks actually fly? Go to an airport someday and see if you think this is a bad business. Even if you understand nothing about financials, I think you can see it's a pretty darn good business to be in these days. That's why the airlines are making billions. How Wall St. can be so pessimistic about the airlines in the current economy with the current industry dynamics is just weird."

"Here is the reason to buy AAL despite so much genuinely bad news. Without doubt, we get closer to a vaccine each day. With vaccine approval, AAL stock will skyrocket - probably, double on the news. Then, continue higher"
The time to buy is when others are bearish and the price is low. That time is now. Don’t miss out! This will be $12 to $13 tomorrow in my opinion.

Aka, there's nothing wrong with their business whatsoever. Yes, they need to raise fares by a percentage or two (as do other airlines) but they seem to be doing this. And it's a very routine matter. Meanwhile, you have other airlines, like LUV, that seem to have some more significant competitive threats. Airlines like Frontier and Spirit are competing against them. Note that LUV's unit revenue gains are below AAL's, And nobody really cares. It's just very, very odd. I've been following this company and its predecessors for two decades now and the future has never looked better than it does today. And nobody can really challenge that assertion. But Wall St. doesn't care one bit about this."
"I think we have reached an interesting transition point in the markets. We've come to accept the current rate of new cases and deaths from community spread in the US. That, combined with how oversold markets are, will put significant pressure to the upside. However, the worst case scenarios are all still out there and very scary. News flow could easily re-tank the market. I'm hopeful for a relief rally tomorrow. I really want to cover my position with some out of the money puts, but I don't want to get my face ripped off paying for them."
The stock is lower now than a year ago at this time. Let’s hope no executives received any bonuses this year
Thanks to the wonderful internet it’s a question of when—not if—DFW or ORD or ATL is Hong Kong. The market has this right. It’s a discounting mechanism and flagged AALs issues LONG BEFORE the small investor
"Does AAL have listed bonds, liquid ones to buy? I can’t find any listed at my broker. I wonder if this might be a way to play this. Either make a huge profit when things turn around and the debt gets upgraddd ..or..worst case get a nice debtor in possession equity stake. Just like GM, this thing could be great if you wiped out the debt."

"""Dougie-Debt"" Parker is now selling the $42+ shares, that he borrowed almost $13B to buyback, for only $13.5. That's a whooping loss of $29 a share, what a ""brilliant"" CEO. His buyback strategy is now officially a huge failure that caused almost all of AAL's assets to be leveraged ahead of Covid-19. I'm sure he's trying hard to change the narrative on the huge debt, but all the new planes sitting in storage were paid for with cash flow. With Parker at the helm, AAL looks like it's back to bankruptcy. The BOD should have fired him years ago when he started borrowing all the money to fund his buyback program. Guess that's one of the problems with having the CEO as the Chairman of the Board."

AAL deserves to be higher than it was On January 1, 2020, even though the company took on debt, and faces a secular decline in business travel because ... ?2. Average analysts price target for AAL is $17.44, and even today's upgrade by GS is only to a PT of $20 yet we retails investors know better than analysts who have covered airlines for years because ... ?This is not a new technology or other growth stock where analysts may miss the big picture, it's an old industry that's well covered and well understood.

"Remember one thing! Do not let the daily price fluctuations jostle you to sell your long position if it's in a decline unless an avalanche will be triggered in the markets in the next three days. Keep focus on the day's closing stock price of AAL. I expect the ADVT to be around 45M for the three days before earnings. That is considered relatively a low volume and I don't think it will push the stock price down substantially. Q2 and Q3 suggests that even if the stock price stays below the median of the past week, $15.90, the stock price should exceed that level on the day of earnings if not before."
"At some point this will be a buy again. We are nearing oversold/overreaction terrtory. I sold a piece at $43.60 on Friday, will be back in in the high 30s. Still hold substantial core position. Also sold Jan $45 puts at $6.50 3 weeks ago when aal as at $39.25. Those should be fine."

"I hope Jamie Baker asks a question about volatility on the next earnings call. His note this week mentions that AAL regularly drops 30% for no reason. Management needs to address this problem. It may not be so bad for them -- they can sometimes snag ridiculously cheap stock options during the downdrafts -- but it's terrible for their ""real"" shareholders. It basically makes the stock uninvestible for long term individual holdings. I'm not smart enough to know exactly what they should do, but I think raising the dividend would be a good first step."

"I had to chuckle when I read Adam Levine-Weinberg's take on ALK and JBLU, after they announced lower than forecast Q1 RASM for the first quarter (for the year, both airlines say RASM still looks good). Levine wrote:""Of course, there are no sure things in investing. But after their latest setbacks, shares of Alaska Air and JetBlue Airways trade for less than 10 times forward earnings. That provides a lot of cushion for investors in case the airlines face other unexpected setbacks later this year or in 2020.""AAL has announced no RASM shortfalls, or other business woes. It's forward p/e is now 5. So much for ""cushion""!"

It’s true that Parker has literally separated more families at AAL gates due to basic economy fares (NO preassigned seats) than Trump has separated at the gates of Texas and Arizona.Maybe we can let Parker go..to work in administration.

"HA's Update yesterday reaffirmed the stronger than expected revenue trend will continue. This ain't Fake News! I know, sometimes these insiders don't have the confidence Uncle has, HA only got $109m from their 5m shares of ATM when they can get $130m Today."
"TSA numbers continue to impress. Just think how many people still think they are not even permitted to leave their homes much less travel! The word will get out. The California airport I traveled from recently actually had a pulse. Had to wait a little in the TSA line, 3x more active than when I had just been there a week before. Should UAL face shareholder lawsuits? They are clearly not acting in the best interests of shareholders. Just you a search engine and type in IATA middle seats. There is no ""data or science"" to back up the need to block middle seats. Ok back to beer and sunshine and the shut-ins can't back to moaning about the debt (interest cost is easily handled for AAL) and how they will never fly again. I've never had a Facebook account and never use Amazon, but it seems lots of other people do."
"""American has significant issues, but in all but the worst-case scenario it should have the wherewithal to avoid a bankruptcy filing.

"Update: As of today, China death rate is 3.67% as 58.9% of their claimed cases were cured; the rest of the world just started to heat up, with only 1.62% death rate and only 7% cured. America has 107 cases with 6 death, that's death rate of 5.61%, Iran started with even higher death rate but after their increasing cases announced, the death rate is down to 4.4%.When China's confirmed case was below 2,000 chases, their death rate was about 25%, lower than 1/24's 64% when 1,287 cases was announced with only 41 death.What the heck am I saying? Wufu death rate should be a couple percent, the only reason it can be much higher than that is only because not enough cases have been confirmed yet."

"Mar. 27--More than 30,000 mechanics, fleet workers and other union workers overwhelmingly approved a new contract Thursday that gives them pay raises, bonuses and job security as the carrier enters another period of uncertainty.The three biggest groups in the TWU-IAM Association all reported more than 90% approval. Getting a deal for the maintenance workers turned out to be one of the most difficult tasks in the history of American Airlines (AAL) and comes as the company's existence is once again in peril from a sudden decimation in traffic caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.The deal gives immediate 4% to 18% pay raises for each worker depending on experience and job, $3,000 to $6,000 signing bonuses and annual raises during the five-year life of the deal. It also guarantees jobs for every worker at their current location, which could be an important factor as the company looks to slim down payrolls in the coming months.The deal also includes baggage handlers and facilities maintenance workers.The unions covering workers bragged that they won concessions from American putting limits on outsourcing and keeping much of its heavy maintenance work in-house.""The resounding approval of these contracts yet again proves that by standing together and demonstrating our solidarity and determination, we are able to achieve contracts our members deserve,"" said a statement from Association Chair Sito Pantoja and Vice Chair Alex Garcia. ""It is that same resolve that will get us through this unprecedented crisis facing our airline, our industry and our country.""For its part, American gets labor peace with mechanics for the first time since they started negotiating in 2015. American called it a best-in-class contract that gave better pay and benefits to its workers than competing airlines.""This agreement is a long-awaited milestone for our company,"" said a statement American Airlines (AAL) senior vice president David Seymour sent to employees Thursday night after the vote was announced. ""Not only will our ... colleagues receive an industry-leading contract, but it also marks the first time that all our represented team members -- in every workgroup throughout the company -- will be working under joint agreements.""But the deal didn't come easy. After years of being deadlocked in contract talks and mediations, American sued the union association in May, alleging a work slowdown intended to put pressure on the airline in negotiations. American blamed maintenance workers for thousands of delays and cancellations last summer. The company said labor strife contributed to struggles it had delivering passengers on time.American won a federal injunction in court in August, setting the stage for six more months of talks before the tentative deal was reached in August.Part of the problem in getting a new contract was the fact that the unions for legacy American Airlines (AAL) and U.S. Airways never signed a unified deal when the two companies merged in 2013. The two groups brought different benefits and priorities to a new contract, and American had a problem finding a deal all parties could approve."

"Reserve/Equity Fund Distribution UpdateDated : May 04, 2018TO: AA Locals 501 – 591Dear Brothers and Sisters:As a follow up to today’s conference call with TWU American Airlines Presidents, below is a summary of the latest developments, with respect to the TWU Reserve/Equity fund distribution:– First and foremost, I am happy to announce that the TWU International was successful in our appeal to the IRS and a capital gains tax will not be assessed by the IRS against the Reserve Fund, resulting in an additional thirty five percent (35%) approximately being available for the equity distribution to our members — monies that otherwise would have gone to the IRS.– The company has notified TWU that it remains on track to provide the necessary tax payer information to Computershare, from the Project Spring computer software program update, for a late May/early June distribution. (“Project Spring” is a merger of the legacy AA and US human resources computer systems.) The company must provide this information to Computershare, since TWU does not employ our members and TWU does not have the necessary individual taxpayer information for each member needed for this type of distribution.– The distribution of the funds from Computershare will be made by check and mailed to each eligible employee’s last known address on file with the Company.– A meeting is scheduled for May 24th in order for TWU to discuss any final items needed by Computershare to ensure the accuracy of our membership list and the amount/percentage of distribution for each eligible employee.– A legal determination, in accordance with IRS rules and regulations, has been requested with respect to the withholding of income taxes on the equity distributions to be made in accordance with the following formula:1. For active employees and those on leave of absence or those who have since left the company via retirement, termination or otherwise and are still alive, American Airlines will issue a W2 and withhold applicable taxes2. For employees, deceased after 1/1/2018, American Airlines will issue a W2 with and will withhold applicable taxes; and3. For employees deceased prior to 1/1/2018, Computershare will issue a 1099 form and no taxes will be withheld.In closing, we are nearing the end of this long-awaited process and I want to again thank you for your patience and perseverance and your faith in the TWU. I also want to remind each of you and all of our TWU members that this equity distribution is not a bonus, but rather hard earned dollars that truly can never adequately repay for the sacrifices our AA members were forced to accept in bankruptcy in order to permit AA to remain in business.TWU International will continue to provide any new or additional information and details to you as soon as they become available.Fraternally,Gary PetersonTWU International Vice President"
"I am waiting for single digits, then will invest my whole portfolio into the three major carriers, United / American / Delta. Curious, why is anyone investing now?

"I'm worried about the declaration of recession begun in February and the effect it will have on the overall markets. If the recovery is not as sudden as the drop, then markets will correct. I've gone to 84% cash and liquidated AAL at $20 for 36% profit. Might have made a mistake (Lord knows I do), but I can sleep at night. I have a buy order for AAL at $16 good for 60 days. I don't think BK is in the future, but it's time to relax on the sidelines. GLTA"

"Uncle (or anyone), Do you agree with the $11.8 B for Q3 revenues? And if so, does that only give $1.40 EPS? These are yahoo numbers. Even with fuel and casm-ex increases, I get more than the $1.40 eps. Something is not right, and maybe it is my numbers, but help."
"The fundamental arguement: You dont make money. Revenues are down 90% YOY. Flight capacity is down 75% YOY. Thats huge! The $40M cash fire you have, is wayy too high. You lose money on every flight. CEO says it could take years to return to 2019 levels. Also stated that its possible many july flights become cancelled. A second wave from corona virus could END AAL. They wouldnt survive. I wouldnt be a gambler on the fact a second wave doesnt come, becuz it looks like its coming. And if that happens, the stock would deff test new lows. The balance sheet is terrible. You owe a BOAT-LOAD of debt that you cant afford to pay unless AAL somehow is able to dump some stock before the price goes back down (they really need to sell some stock!). Every analyst on CNBC called AAL a strong sell. Every advisor is steering their clients away from the entire sector. Its bad for airlines right now. Its bad for travel period. The technical argument: Your chart has formed a bearish inverted head and shoulders pattern. You also had a bearish engulfing candle form on the weekly. That calls for a gap down to 12, which you may ring some stop-losses & weak hands down to 10, if that gap-down takes place. Just as it is possible for the stock to go up, it is also very very very possible that the stock goes down! The delusional long argument:Robinhood traders & gamblers will buy & run up the stock price at any price because we will be flying at 100% capacity in 4 years bruhh. Unfortunately, in my opinion, they dont hold enough volume to really move the share price. I think the only reason you went up 20% friday was due to a short squeeze and gamblers buying at any price. But we all know that wont end well. Thats why i call for a gap down to 12. I have legit reasons. Any long care to share why they think its going to 50 or 500? ...as i seen on twitter."
Downgrade to sell by Analysts means they are buying and it will pop very soon. It works every time....AAL is the largest US airline and the states are opening in few days.....$16 in few weeks.
"""Biggest challenge since Merger"", according to Parker.It appears to be so, with AAL trading at $14.77 (record $14.87 on 7/19/18) lower than DAL on share price, and at 37.21% lower in percentage (Record 39.64% on 7/12/18), it's quite embarrassing.Luckily, the sentiment toward Airlines is improving, the upward momentum may speed up after next Super Thursday.This is not a fortune telling, it's based on fundamental analysis."
"AAL did reiterate their revenue and cost savings initiatives of $2.6 billion over the next two years.Meanwhile it looks like the stock is stuck in the range of $42-45 (+/- 50 cents) until it's not. Some day it will be announced that a fare increase stuck whether that be tomorrow, next week, next month, next quarter, or when. That is what the industry needs."

AAL revenues = $46 billion. AAL market cap = 9.6 billion. Makes no sense at all.

"For those of you looking way down the road, if they take govt assistance and don't pay it back, there is a good chance many Americans will boycott those airlines. Same thing happened to GM and Chrysler back in 2010. Many people including most of the people I know, refused to buy there products. Ford and Toyota business boomed because of this. If airlines want to publicly announce they have no intention of repaying the tax payers, 2021 will be just as bad as 2020. Southwest is the best positioned airline to recover from this."
This move above $40 is quite painful for GREG
Gentleman’s buy on the rumor and sale at the news conclusion AAL will retreat to 19.50$ then it will bounce back on May to 26$+ and even to pre pandemic levels 30$+ this my analysis my advice buy once it reaches 20s $
go AAL go....$40 today
"Ahead of HA's earnings Report, EPS has been raised from $1.61 to $1.69, and Revenue up to $755.95m...Stock has been Up to $30.13, it's a Big Surprise that it is trading Higher than AAL...Uncle is still pssed that Isom man still has guts to award himself so many ""restricted"" shares that he has to Sell 5,151 shares at so low price to cover taxes he has to pay for."

For all you guys out there that are against an airline bail out. I have one question? What if we let them fail? What’s your feelings on a 3 month waiting period for an airline ticket and a price of 3k to get them....
"It was a stunning revelation (to me at least) that the plane in the Lion Air crash experienced a serious problem the day before and yet the plane was allowed to fly without figuring what was going on. I presume the air crew reported the problem they experienced the day before. I have no knowledge of aircraft management, but I have to believe that an incident like that would have caused that plane to be grounded in the US. This incident highlights the differences in pilot training and management of these foreign carriers and US/European based carriers. This could help AAL bookings in the international markets. I know I was surprised/stunned at the relative inexperience of the co-pilot in the Ethiopia Air incident. I would have thought that air crews would have similar minimum requirements for hours of experience regardless of the company. Not_A_Short"

Oil continues to fall. All attempts for OPEC to reverse this downward trend by sentiment and persuasion have ended in total failure. Now they have to decide how much revenue they are willing to sacrifice and even that might not be enough to do it long term. Iraq and Kuwait increased their exports by 10% in the last month. Libya offset this with a million bpd deficit and they are quickly trending to 0. They only produce slightly over 200k bpd right now so that’s not going be enough to do anything moving forward.

"AAL is fast approaching its 52 week low, running a mediocre but consistent business in a good economy with a 10% corporate tax benefit. Parker speaks tomorrow which (5Qs in a row) results in a 10% drop in the share price.

"There is certainly a lot of negatives things seemingly happening. And AAL is a broken stock until it isn't (not the company).Oil dropping could be forecasting economic slowness, but probably because of more Iranian oil slipping out plus shale.Mexico tariff threat … immigration related. Heard Mexico could fix this by allowing us to return asylum seekers to Mexico while awaiting their asylum trial. This needs Mexico's ok. Though congress should fix it. It has no parallels to China.Everybody said the market would drop ""towards"" the December lows at some point this year. Well, the market is dropping. Everyone did warn of volatility this year. Are the recent happenings a reason, and nothing more?The market did start down with the China news. There are many different takes on China. I can add one thing about the cost of tariffs … China so far seems to be letting their currency weaken, lessening the impact of tariffs … recently only a 5%+ relief, but almost 15% from the recent strength of the yuan. Will China let the yuan go over 7? A weak yuan does hurt China and their plans.Someday AAL won't be a broken stock …"

"AAL is the largest airline in America with the youngest fleet and it's now valued 4th in market cap below DAL, LUV and UAL. Since its merger/bankruptcy 4 years ago, AAL has increased its debt by $8B, which it has used to help buy back 38% of its outstanding shares. That financial decision continues today and has achieved a drop in valuation of $4B (-17%) and increased the annual (3%) debt payment by ~$250M."
"Uncle Only knows that AAL's Market Cap is not even $8bn, it's $7.6bn if Parker hasn't Repurchased much.AAL has lost 37.15%, UAL 35.02%, DAL 25.55% and LUV 17.81% due to Wufu.UAL is till 24.15% Up since Kirby joined UAL on 8/29/2016, LUV is up 28.36%, DAL 37.36%, x-div adjusted, AAL has Lost 48.8% since."

"""AAL filed its customary quarter-end investor update and raised 1Q18 TRASM guidance to +3-4%, the high end of the prior +2-4% range, and raised 1Q18 pretax margin to +4-5%, up from the prior +2-4% range on that better TRASM and on better CASMx, though AAL cited timing on the latter and affirmed the FY18 CASMx guide, as well as the 2018 EPS guide of $5.50 to $6.50. AAL bought back $450m of stock in 1Q18 and affirmed 2018 ASM growth (+~2.5%).

"Maybe the bottom here, as long as the market holds up? There is zero reason for any rational person to sell AAL at this price, so maybe rational will work. I would submit that there are few S&P 500 companies with fewer ""real"" problems than AAL. Just try to name the biggest problem AAL has. Mechanics? MAXes? These are certainly important issues for management to deal with, but they are not the kind of matters that would remotely justify the current valuation. They don't affect the core business, which doesn't seem troubled at all."

"Economy remains very strong, there's no need for Airlines to go Up and Down with Dow Jokes, if that's what's in people's mind.Artificially jacking up oil price is like adding taxes to consumers, it's all OPEC/Non OPEC's occlusion and it's not good to the Global Economy. We should keep pumping Shale oil harder, now exceeding Saudi and expecting to pass Russia before the end of the year, we can reduce trade deficits with most of our Asian countries by exporting oil to them. We need more trade talks, no wars!ps, The only exporting port that takes VLCCs in America is LOOP (Louisiana Offshore Oil Port), we need a couple more ports ready so we can do our jobs."
bankruptcy looming!
"King's Speech:ALK filed an 8-K today updating guidance, most notably raising 4Q RASM guidance (again) by 1pp at the low end from +3-5% y/y to +4-5% y/y, citing strong close-in demand. Flat QTD loads suggest ALK is driving better yields, frankly which we find surprising given ongoing price competition on the west coast (though it’s stabilized lately) and a softening pricing environment to Hawaii. ALK’s other network improvements must be paying off, in addition to, perhaps, some other ALK-specific revenue initiatives that are ramping. ALK affirmed 4Q18 CASMx guidance (+3.6% y/y) and ASM growth guidance (+1.1% y/y). But we trim our numbers on an unexpectedly high fuel cost/gal guide of $2.36/gal. DAL hosted its annual analyst day today (12/13/18) in NYC and provided initial 2019 financial guidance, which was ok. DAL highlighted its long-term sustainable advantages in a good presentation that served as a reminder why DAL is a forward thinking, competitive force. DAL is doing interesting things through its subsidiaries and at its key airports, which are driving earnings diversity and loyalty. Though we view airlines as a troubled space these days, DAL is a standout for under-appreciated reasons that we expect will become more appreciated over time."

"Not going bankrupt does not suggest an airline stock is a hot performer. Suppose AAL is bumping along in the $1-$2 range and doesn't go bankrupt. How does that help your bank account? I'm long and stuck in the stock like everyone else, but find little solace in the argument about no bankruptcy. IF (that's a big if) the vaccine development moves faster than expected or the FDA allows an even more expedited process than we are already seeing, the airlines will move early in anticipation of increasing travel. We need this to happen by early fall. On the other hand, if the self centered paranoid people worried about their rights instead of others' lives and the health of their country continue to congregate in groups without masks, cases and deaths will spike and people will be even more afraid to travel. I get it, wearing a mask is uncomfortable and annoying, but I wear one and encourage others to do the same because we can't really know when we are contagious. Remember, this all started in the US with a small number of infected people who unknowingly spread their illness to others who did the same, and so on. My sympathies to fellow longs who have sizable positions here."

Shares soared by more than 80% before the market opened, but later pulled back and traded at $18.15 , up 9.6%, later in the day.

"First of all, I wish all best in their investing and trading activities. So this is how the new year started, ehh! Personally, I wouldn't panic YET! This is a 18.7% drop in stock price from its most recent high of $18.63 back on December 9th. We were here two weeks ago as well. Before I tell further, let's make a visit to the memory lane briefly:25 days ago,""what I have observed with ALL for more than 4 years is that, anytime stock gains value noticeably, it is usually two weeks and rarely as long as 4 weeks, it retreats a lot(I wrote on this in details multiple times in the past). This is now probably the longest period the stock is moving upward. We can expect a retreat because of it and also it is the last month of the year when the losing stocks most probably will be dumped into the market and I tend to think Travel and Leisure stocks are of them.""7 days ago,""the daily volume is dropping lately. If the trend continues, the short ratio will be higher. This situation generally signals higher level of shorting in the near future causing decline in share price before Shorts can attempt to cover some of their positions.""I wouldn't jumped off AAL ship yet until I see the stock price drops to mid $14s, and market sentiment turns negative, then we can see the stock price drop may reach 30% to 35% from $18.63 level. That's the bottom of this stock I tend to think for the time being. I shared my activities regarding my AAL position n the last month after making comments above. But, I am a compulsive trader, so I ignored some of my own advice. I did buy puts as I saw fit and closed them a week ago and I bought calls immediately after. However, I did mention my timing is always a little off, I get in too early or out too early and leave half of the maximum gains on the table. But, buying the calls even though a little early helped me to receive more premiums at a lower strike price than I intended to ask, if he stock price continued to drop, I wouldn't be behind while I would also be more brave and wrote cover calls on them at lower strike price with higher premium. They will all expire on Friday. I am still long on AAL so I'd like to hold on them for the time being.Good luck."

"It’s not your time airlines. Your bill is the second bill that won’t get passed in 2020. “One of the bills would provide $748 billion to fund an array of programs that have generated consensus in the stimulus talks, including the revival of federal unemployment payments and a popular small business loan program, as well as funding for vaccine distribution, food aid, schools and other institutions struggling to stay afloat because of the pandemic. A second measure includes the two biggest sticking points to a deal: $160 billion to bolster state and local governments, and a temporary coronavirus liability shield for businesses, nonprofits, schools and hospitals.”"
Prior to this crisis 2020 worldwide airline revenue was predicted to be 872B. 113B is 13% haircut. Nothing else to add.
"While volume is not strong, AAL has a beautiful bouncing trade line today. Cheers!"
"Before the pandemic, American airlines was at a 2016 low near $30. So it was already underperforming. With the loss of revenues from the pandemic that will take years to recover and the added debt/dilution, what should be the valuation of AAL post pandemic even assuming traffic is back to 90% pre-pandemic? Should it even get back near the low it was at pre-pandemic?I am asking a serious question to the long term holder that know the finances and viability of the company. Where should the valuation be in 2021 post pandemic? IS it already there taking in consideration the added debt and secondary dilution?"

"Only Parker’s mom and mr. crazy iahphx could argue with this.

"It appears Kirby is following Parker's lead on refinancing and turning down the CARES Act Loan; Kirby is not as straight forward as Parker but their paying off $520m initial borrowing of the CARES Act loan received revealed so. ALK has NOT said so far if they take theirs or not, but they've delayed their decision till May.Kirby counts the $7bn CARES Act loan and $1bn line-of-credit as part of their end of 1Q Liquidity of #21bn,that's $13+7+1. In the meanwhile, AAL, UAL and LUV have their newly received MAXes ""grounded"" for fixing ""problems"", Jefferies and Cowen said it won't affect the Airlines much. With most of the airplanes in service by now, it won't be big problem since the replacement is easier to be arranged. Uncle insists that BA should compensate for the inconvenience as usual."
"I feel a little cautious on AAL's fuel savings in Q4. At the end of October when they gave their guidance they probably knew October's fuel cost plus they always seem to lock in fuel 2-3 weeks ahead … so at the time of guidance, they knew they would have high fuel cost for 50% of the quarter. And they probably locked in fuel for December by the end of the 1st week of December. It's good that fuel is a tailwind going into 2019 (I'll take it), but I think it will start creeping back up. DAL is probably a little pessimistic in their fuel forecast for 2019, but it could turn out to be reasonable. For AAL, 2019 is going to depend on their initiatives and execution with a reasonable economic backdrop."
AAL is begging for an activist investor

Maybe we'll know more with the earnings release in January. After all it's AAL what could go wrong?"
Citi just rated Carnival a 'buy' with a $30 target. These people have to get to their cruises somehow.
"Airlines will still lose a lot of money this quarter, but looking forward the future is Bright, we've seen the light at the end of the tunnel.Screw the Jet Fuel, even we'll be paying around $1.76/gal but comparing to 2019 1Q $2.04, 2Q 2.14, 3Q $2.05 and 4Q $2.05, Uncle projects that at least a couple of Airlines will turn profit in the Very near future.Keep in mind that Airlines will be more lean and mean, with more efficient aircrafts and lower headcounts."
Emergency COVID treatment + Disinfectant approval with EPA + hopefully good TSA numbers tomorrow means we about to take OFF
"BTW, if you don't like the China stats for some reason, look at Hong Kong. Despite AAL's pilots being afraid to fly there, they've never had much of a coronavirus problem. 101 total cases. Even with community spread, they average about 1 new case a day. I think the temperature helps -- which will also be important in the USA in the next few weeks. But again, if this thing didn't blow up in HKG, the odds that it blows up in the USA is remote. Just a reality check. The fear is WAY worse than the situation on the ground. I'd also note that today, even with the repatriated Diamond Princess pax, there are only 7 ""serious/critical"" corona cases in the USA."
"The rate of daily Covid infections is declining in 30 states and the District of Columbia, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows, and one-in-three Americans are now fully vaccinated..."
"Look people, at the beginning of the year, management was forecasting earnings of about $5.50, it looks like we'll come in around $4.50, is that really reason for the stock to go down almost 50%? I get there are legitimate criticisms of current management but at some point the valuation just becomes absurd. We are still chugging along making $4-5 every year, the debt is now decreasing and management has said it will decrease each year going forward, they have a huge cash position to protect against the debt risks, and they have a plan to grow earnings through continued merger integration cost savings, revenue projects, and redeployment of capacity to its most profitable hubs thanks to 23 brand new gates together at DFW and CLT."
"Well, the buyer/buyers at the end of the day were not market related, as the market ticked down, and were not Doug Parker, who cannot buy in the last 15 minutes of the session."

"AAL ""the airline"" has got its mojo back: there are basically no more maintenance cancellations. The airline now runs at a 100% completion factor on normal weather days, like today. On-time performance is respectable in the 80s. Jet fuel is down to $1.83/gallon. The planes are crazy full.And none of this matters, at least right now."
"Sold all 10,000 shares I had. I just couldn’t stomach the risk vs reward with tomorrow’s earnings and I need the money for a condo purchase next month. Goodluck everyone! May the shorts burn in hell."
"Could that 52 Week Low of $9.09 be the bottom? whatever you buy in now, your gonna make money in the long term. Airlines are the only stocks that are still preparing to takeoff."
"So if you want to try to make money from this latest virus panic like we made money with ebola, you need to understand trading dynamics (""the panic"") but you need to follow the science. The science comes from the epidemiologists, mostly American, who have the expertise to predict what will happen. I read every epidemiologist report I can find. Like today, there's an expert at the University of Utah medical center who says this:""An important measure epidemiologists use of how infectious an organism is the basic reproduction number (R0 or “Rnaught,” defined as the number of new infections causes by each infected person). SARS and MERS have quite low R0 meaning they are not very easily transmitted. We still have no estimates of how contagious 2019-nCoV is but my early guess is that it is likely to be in the same range as MERS.""That's the whole ballgame here. If this expert is correct -- and so far we have no evidence to the contrary -- Wuhan disease will fizzle out fairly quickly and great profits can be made buying the panic. But given how absurdly AAL trades, it's better to wait for more science."
"May 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it screened 1.64 million passengers on Thursday at U.S. airports, the highest number since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic slashed travel demand. Today 22$........"

Uncle will check if they're the underwriters for JBLU's recent convertible. Upgrades without solid reasoning is something worth questioning. Also, there is 100% no reason to give AAL targets that well below current price, regardless whatever their purposes, AAL will still go back to $26. Are they trying to smoke Parker out to say/guide something?"

"Corporate Travel Survey Shows Greater Willingness For Business Trips55 percent of GBTA buyer and procurement members feel their employees are “willing” or “very willing” to travel for business in the current environment, a significant 49% increase from a GBTA January poll. Just 17% of the buyer and/or procurement members feel their employees are unwilling to travel for business at the present time. Twenty-six percent of companies also said they plan to resume domestic business travel “in the near future”—a 16% uptick from the previous survey.Border closures and restrictions were cited as the reason for reduced business travel by 68% of GBTA members and stakeholders, while 56% said the restrictions and closures increased confusion and uncertainty about when business travel could resume. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed support airlines requiring passengers provide proof of vaccination to fly once vaccines become more readily available. Europeans are more likely than Americans to support proof of vaccination to (65% versus 54%) and 43% say border closures and restrictions have impacted their company recovery efforts in 2021. This appears to weaken the argument that, in a post-pandemic world, companies will continue to rely on cheaper virtual meetings rather than return to in-person meetings.The survey does not offer airlines any near-term relief, however. The large majority of GBTA member companies, 89%, have not re-opened international travel and 64% continue to cancel or suspend domestic travel. Seventy-six percent of them continue to suspend or cancel all business travel regardless of location. “It is reassuring to hear so much discussion around business travel resuming and a change in sentiment from 16% to 25% of GBTA members and stakeholders who have resumed some domestic business travel in the last month,” GBTA interim executive director Dave Hilfman said. An updated report released by the Airlines for America (A4A) association Feb. 19 noted that corporate ticket sales in the U.S. are still down 85.7% versus the same time in 2019. Across all segments, ticket sales are down 66.6%, showing how the corporate travel recovery lags far behind leisure."
this needs 10% increase to recover from the whole week loss...
"Uncle Buffett added shares on DAL, not AAL ..."

"AAL now worth $7B and carrying $34B of debt, while entering a global recession. Genius CEO, genius BOD. How to turn a profitable company into a bankruptcy candidate, hire ""Dougie-Debt"" Parker to enact a zero risk policy for your airline company."
"it’s not like delta is doing any better. all airlines are down. and they will recover when things go back to normal. yes. things will go back to normal just like it did after 9/11 and the 2007 stock crash. airlines, cruises and travel will be the forefront of the recovery."

Greg Capitulation Rally...Rally Caps are on!
"So nobody on Wall St has a clue, or gives a fig at the moment, but AAL operational improvement is accelerating. They have now become one of the most reliable airlines in the world. On reasonable weather days, they are now routinely cancelling NONE of their 3130 daily flights. That's remarkable -- especially given what was going on last spring. I've got to believe this is worth something in profitability."
"Now they are one of the main airlines shipping the vaccine throughout the world, absolutely nothing but good news going forward, if you are short, today was your last chance hope you covered."
"Closing Green Today, I feel it !!"
"This time around is different, vaccines any day now and airline policies will be loosening fast, THIS IS A VERTICAL UPWARD TREND TO $18 DOLA!!!"
"Obviously, the place in the USA to watch closely for virus activity is Seattle. The situation there is concerning, and the unwillingness of local health authorities to release any specific information makes it difficult to get a feel for what's actually going on. Also concerning is NYC, not really for what's actually happened, but what could happen because it's NYC. We also have to watch Europe closely to see what the ""worst case scenario"" actually results in. There is no way to financially game this at the moment, especially with the airlines; too many unknowns."
I wonder who is buying airline stocks during the corona virus crisis ?
"UAL did a amazing ""Head Fake"" to this sector this morning. Of which the sector can't figure how to recover especially AAL the weaker of them all !"

"Former AA CEO stated pilots said that the 737 is safe. What the hell do they know about the engineering or software aspect of airplanes? This statement he made was comical at best. I’ve been in the airline industry for 23 years and observe pilots all day. They give the airliner a once over look, peak inside the landing gear and do the kicking of the tire before entering inside. Amazing mechanical expertise smh. It’s like saying, I drive a car therefore, I’m an auto mechanic."
Cramer: Munoz is taking share away from DAL & AAL. You gotta go with UAL
"UAL earnings look very good. As in, better than average expectations, but no surprises. So as long as Kirby doesn't flub it up tomorrow we should be good too."
"As the MAX problem gets solved, AAL management will now have to deal with another ""silly"" problem: the mechanics. They went to court on Monday to stop a work slowdown, and it seems the union retaliated with more delays on Tuesday! That probably won't go well for the union, as the data will almost certainly help the company get a preliminary injunction against their illegal activity. In the past, judges have levied large fines against illegal slowdowns. This is just a hard game for Parker to play because he wants to be good and fair to his employees, but most airline unions will just see this as a sign of weakness. The courts will likely keep the union in check in the short term, but it will be interesting to see how this plays out during the rest of the year. FWIW, AAL has ""too many"" mechanics compared to its competitors because the union workrules make during much in-house work uneconomic. Another example of the failure of the Railway Labor Act."
"AAL will now hover between $19 and $25, this isnt going anywhere and there is more downside risk than updise from here"
Anyone think this is going to continue down all week?

"I just noticed, most of the stocks are up around 7-10% but volume is not even half of average volume!! Seems like a trap before major pullback?"
"Parker should get in touch with Boeing and delay the delivery of the max aircraft into 21’ and early 22’. He should also further delay flights to China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. That should hopefully cater oil more along with the stock price and force our rivals to do the same which should hurt them significantly more from there he should institute a massive share repurchase. These are all pipe dreams but this would be a good move in the long term."
Trump just tweeted about getting Stimulus done. See you at $15 Monday.
"Street has good bias toward UAL with all the positive headlines and good Call options buying ahead of earnings (with implied 7.1% jump on stock), Uncle does not think they're that great but Uncle won't underestimate the Market Force (manipulation?).Hopefully, they'll be equally Nice to AAL when it reports.Historically, we're in very favorite season for Airline stock performance, hope this time won't be different."
Trump is totally right! Buffet was wrong to sell the stocks! Corona is over!
"Note priced at 3.75%! Amazing that an unsecured note from a b+/bb- rated company is yielding that, oh the times we live in"
"How did we allow stocks that no one had a clue about, such as $NOK $BBBY $AAL and crypto like Dogecoin to scatter us away from the original plan? We're not pumpers, we're opportunists, and that opportunity lay with $BB and still does. We know the potential of this company, the deals they're closing, the solid plans they have in place to propel themselves leagues ahead of many of these pumped stocks.Today, we let $BB bleed and failed to keep it above the $15 target to defeat the shorts before calls expired. $GME and $BB were in this together, alongside one another, making each other undefeatable, yet today $GME pulled ahead (congratulations) whilst $BB faltered.I urge all of my fellow investors to ponder upon our original plans as a community, before the hype clouded everyone's judgement. From the beginning we knew who the winners were, yet now we have forgotten."
"AAL only has to beat the bottom line for the quarter, the current EPS estimate was the Original estimate I showed you guys when the Street was insisting $1.76. That $1.59 was derived using Midpoint guidance, Uncle also submitted to Whisper number site a more optimistic estimate with $11,673m revenue and $1.64 EPS, based on the way they used to beat their guidance by tuning up ASM to 72,900 to 72,950, $2.25/gal fuel assuming they always beat UAL's, 2.25% RASM growth instead of 2%.$11,673m is considered in-line with $11.69bn to me. Investors should care more what Parker has to guide 3Q and pay attention to Pink Slips Savings. Uncle gives Parker double Coupon!"
"AAL—If this is your earnings run, please get with it. You’re late getting started but still have time. I’m sure we would all like to see at least $30 before earnings. I have several stocks making nice moves higher that are not as reasonably valued as you, so let’s get moving. Back to $29 tomorrow would be a good start."
"I doubt it's financially meaningful to AAL, but I think AAL should vigorously defend itself in court and in the media with regard to the pilot's China lawsuit. It is not up to the pilots to determine whether it's ""safe"" to fly to China. That's up to the CDC and the WHO. If they say it's safe, and AAL wants to fly to China, the pilots should fly. While I don't know how financially sustainable the routes are right now, they do provide a valuable service to folks who need to travel. We need to trust the gov't -- as we do every time we board a commercial aircraft -- has proper safety procedures in place. I would also note that, at the moment, the risk to any pilot flying to Beijing and Shanghai is ridiculously small. And even if they contracted Wuhan fly, their odds of getting seriously ill are also small. In other words, the pilots should do their duty. Of course, Parker may decide this isn't worth fighting them on, but I would disagree.https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/1580414857-despite-warning-who-says-no-reason-to-curb-travel-over-china-virus"
Congratulations to everyone holding this stock for the last 3 months. You guys deserve this rally for the enormous risk you took.Enjoy your gains.
how did the sentiment on this change so drastically? because of Jamie Baker and Cowen comments from a few weeks ago? thats all it took? did something change with the management or operations?
I learned the hard way to never ride a stock to the bottom hoping things would turnaround. The fundamentals do not support a turnaround that would save the airlines. The headwinds the airline industry is facing is tremendous

"CFO Kerr says you ""can take bankruptcy off the table."" Honestly, this has been obvious since AAL got its CARES subsidy, but I guess reassurance is good when people outside the company are saying silly things (or are being misinterpreted, like the BA CEO).

"This interest rate stuff is a bit above my pay grade (I guess I should have been more interested in money and banking). I know that low interest rates sometimes ""signal"" a possible recession. That, theoretically, could be bad for airlines, at least if their unit revenues drop more than their unit costs (a questionable assumption, given how fuel prices work, but possible). But let's get away from the theoretical to the here-and-now. We all know that AAL's business strategy is to carry more debt than its major competitors. It's management believes that buying airplanes and borrowing to pay for them is a better strategy than leasing them. So AAL is a ""big"" debtor. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't low interest rates GOOD for debtors? Isn't it likely that AAL can reduce its costs thanks to these lower interest rates? Does the benefit of lower interest rates outweigh the recessionary risks?"
When does AAL declare bankruptcy? $2.2B loss Q1 and Lockdowns did not start until March 16th! Think about that...75 days of revenue and the lost $2.2B...burning $70M/day this quarter. So what a $5B loss this quarter? Can’t see how this stock holds up...
"Now it’s Caterers at DFW...another day, another group of workers."
"Unless we get a market crash, it's hard to see how airline stocks will underperform the broad market here. The travel industry is truly booming now. Because of seasonality (including the certain benefit of prior infections and the very likely benefit of vaccines) Covid cases will continue to collapse in May. The next big test is whether cases seasonally rise in the Sunbelt again next month. The hope is vaxes + prior infections prevent a material rise, but we don't know that yet. The seasonal Sunbelt surge is what dampened travel enthusiasm last summer. It's not LIKELY to happen again, but it is a material risk."
"Pay attention to the median value of the last week I have provided which is $15.90 but the maximum price this stock can reach is $16.7 before earnings.Based on the trend of the past two quarters, the stock price should exceed $15.90 BE or on the day of earnings."

If you don´t have the financial knowledge to understand balance sheets, income statements, and cash flows statements you should look for advice from people who understand finance.AAL´s financial problems are very serious. Even with a recovery later in the year, those problems are gonna take several years of a very good travel environment to ease up. And there´s a big risk even with a travel recovery because financially strong low cost airlines like LUV are going after AAL main markets because they know AAL doesn´t have the financial strength to defend those markets.In a nut shell, for AAL the present is very tough and the future very uncertain."

So travel numbers CONTINUE to increase and the price goes down. Nothing has fundamentally changed from the last two weeks other than IMPROVEMENTS in both debt structure as well as flight numbers. This is a push to get the share price down so that big investors can buy in before it starts moving up to $28-30/share.

"can someone tell me what AAL's projected to actual eps projection hit rate is? at the midpoint of 2020 projections, a 7.73x PE gets you a share price of $42-43. How likely is that they'll hit 4.5-5.5 eps? i know Parker has a bad track record when he's just spewing stuff out of his mouth. but when it comes to actual projections, it has to be pretty solid right?"
"Parker has given the guidance for 1Q, nobody knows what he would guide for 2Q and beyond, be humble, don't be as arrogant as Kirby, people would understand. That said, Uncle continues to believe that USA won't be able to get as many people who want to take Vaccine, it's about time we Start sharing vaccine to the rest of the world. We also have to find a better way, other than Vaccine Passport that the Government refuses to issue, to prove we're vaccinated. Our Proof of vaccination can easily faked, it's very hard to be trusted."
"Looking to jump in with a thousand shares averaged in, but can’t figure out the bottom, this could go lower!"

Does anyone realize what kind of losses are going to be on the next quarterly report? The cash burn is insane. American is the worst of all airlines. 6 billion in cash? That will be burned up in 6 months. They will have to issue 200 million shares at the current stock price to make it to the end of 2021. Profits won't be in sight until 2023. Airline margins have always been thin. Does not look good but people keep buying.
any good articles on what this stock is worth once travel is back to 2019 levels?
"Parker's hometown paper reports AAL is no longer the world's biggest airline. Delta, and by some metrics even United, passed AAL in 2nd quarter. The Parker legacy."
Oh Parker.
"BTW, Boeing CEO Calhoun comes off much better if you actually WATCH his now infamous interview with NBC yesterday. His response to the question about layoffs/""disappearing airlines"" should have been more precise, but he definitely did not predict the demise of a US airline. He did predict that there would be ""adjustments"" -- aka layoffs -- this Fall. I don't know of anyone who thinks otherwise. Of course, that doesn't make an interesting storyline, and today's media isn't very good at focus on actual facts.https://www.today.com/video/boeing-ceo-it-could-take-3-to-5-years-for-airline-industry-to-return-from-apocalyptic-state-83326533868"
I wonder if Parker is a buyer at $30?Just think if he bought AAL puts with all that buyback cash.
We seriously need to hear about each and every airline making capacity growth cuts this earnings season.

Big jobs number today good for airlines but still need aal and some others to counter DALs crummy rasm guides. Unless bottom fell out of demand in December its hard to see aals numbers being as bad as DALs. Shutdown has got to be hurting demand to a certain extent. Three Stooges need to show major progress on China talks and Moe needs to cut a deal on shutdown to keep this rally from being a one day wonder
Short Squeeze...... lets buy more...
"Where were we? Roughly about 16 trading days ago, I did say ""if there is any risk appearing in the horizon, you know the share price will retreat a lot faster. If the stock price drops to low 22s, then the next support level will be low $20s. So keep an eye on any developments that may present risk for AAL share price."" (link : https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/community?p=AAL&messageId=95df85b6-c037-4633-afec-5f086de13227&replyId=a8c513b5-f36a-4862-91c0-4a86098eb6cb&bcmt=1)If the earning is not good and outlook is grim, expect the stock price to drop to low $18s. However, personally, I think AAL will do better than DAL and UAL just like I thought in the last two quarters. Thus, it all depends on the demand-supply which will determine what direction the stock price will move following on 4/22. If shorts have the courage, they can short AAL shares more thus sinking stock price further. Date___the total shares being shorted___ Short interest(SI)% ____Share Price12/31/20___171.3M___ SI is 26.7%____Share price is $15.77In mid-March___SI is about 74M and stock price reached as much as $26.20SI has dropped by 57% while stock price has gained AMA 66%On 04/20/21 : If SI is 77M(12%) or 96MM (15%), then SI is down -45%(@12%) or SI is down -56% (@15%) while the share Price is up 27% at $20.07 in comparison to the figures are given on 12/31/20. This may tell us that the short recovery is happening faster than the share price rise at a ratio of closer to 1.6 to 2.0However, that was just the opposite in April when the short interest level dropped by 57% while the share price rose 66%. This is clearer if we compare April and Mid March numbers. If we say there has not been any significant change in SI since mid-March (it appears that it SI has been up a couple of percentages, I might be wrong), or use the same assumption above that the SI is between 77M(12%) and 96M(15%) currently, that is an increase of between 4% and 30% in SI but the change in share price is -23%. In others words, the rate of change in share price as the people keep selling AAL shares is higher than the rate of change in SI. The resistance by the long position holders is not strong enough.We can say that the shorts with the support from those with bearish/neutral sentiments as a result of the weak quarterly results from DAL and UAL, dictate the share price nowadays. Doug Parker, the Brutus in AAL, has already sunk a dagger in AAL's valuation last week."
"Bearish Dead Fish comes to Raise (Correct) Targets on Airlines ...Barclays raised Targets for LUV from $51 to $64, JBLU from $14 to $20, DAL from $42 to $52, AAL from 11 to $18, ALK from $54 to $68, SAVE from $35 to $50, UAL from $44 to $62Meaning, they've been sleeping at Work and now it's time to wake Up, But eyes are still half closed."

"when is it time to buy and hold? IMHO, watch the news. if it comes out that the curve is flattering,that's good news and we're starting to come out of this. if they say the drugs they've been talking about are working great and the mortality rate is dropping significantly, that's huge! if they say the timetable for the vaccine has been shortened and be ready for the general public by year end, another game changer. these are potential buy signals IMHO. best wishes"
"The announcement the company is going to paying down debt and stress cash flow, i.e. cost containment, was a game changer. The debt was used to purchase a fuel efficient fleet of aircraft and fracking has collared the price of fuel which means aal's practice of not hedging fuel was not only correct but cost effective. The airline will be flying jets sipping fuel for 20 years while other airlines will be adding debt ro replace afing fleets with type aircraft aal already has in the air. Complain about Parker all you want, he is ahead of the curve. Wall Street is through punishing aal. It will soon be valued similar to ual maybe even closer to luv as this plays out. And the labor negotiations will be settled by month end. I expect the stock to be high thirties low forties soon then as cash flow increases due to diminishong debt load and efficient aircraft to move into the sixties and highe, time frame for that, 12 to 24 months."
"Right now, AAL share price is benefiting from every other airlines performance.However In one week, we'll hear from the worst CEO of the bunch - ""Mr. B-52"" Parker.I can only wonder what disappointment he's cooking up. We've already heard about the lousy earnings, the sub-par RASM, and the lousy margins.Guess that leaves the future expectations..."
"This is so overvalued, it hurts to see.They were at 28$ before the lockdown, now they will hopefully be at 55% capacity starting from July, while having lost billions in the last 3 months and being saved from bankrupcy by the feds. Yet the current value is at ~75% of the value they had before the lockdown. It will take them at least one year to recover from this. This should crash today, during the weekend or the next week (I'm betting on the weekend). If not, it will 100% happen when the Q2 earnings report comes to light.Sell now, buy again when it reaches 16$ and hold for easy profits."
"Well this is interesting. DAL jumps because their revenue went up because, they say, many travelers moved to them from other airlines. But the others jumped up as well. Now there's market logic at work."
AAL has $4b of cash and $41b of debt and NOLs. YIKESThe problem is here that one bad quarter could send the stock to $4-5 like 2008

Why AAL is lagging behind while others airlines are gaining momentum? Is it time to sell or wait a while?
"Due to unexpectedly high demand for travelers in air traffic and covid19 restriction on airplanes, most airlines had to cancel a lot of flights. People are coming back to fly again Airlines stock going to moon soon don't miss out the Christmas Presents this year."
TSA Data for 3/28 was 1.5 Mil!!
Flight aware only 9 cancelled AAL flights so far today. So those 14 787s must be back in service?
Uncle Buffet may not buy all of aal for 10b premium but at these market cap levels you would think he would be adding substantially though would put him over 10%. Second time in 4q trading at around 15b cap . Whats the big deal with exceeding 10% ?

"I gotta tell ya it's been rather a painful month for short sellers who had to cough up 40% borrowing fees. The longer it takes for this stock to go down, the more it will hurt and the possibility of them breaking even will be slimmer. It will mess up their psyche. This situation might even propel the stock price further up once they start jumping ship. However, keep in mind, the airline index has done superbly since it hit the rock bottom back in mid-March when COV-19 pandemic began so you should anticipate a pull back."
Oh Parker
I lost respect for this stock. I might buy again at the end of next week when it goes down to @10

Kirby used to say he loved to repurchase all the company's shares, yeah, he Stopped at repurchasing 142.44m shares at $63.48/share."
I believe AAL management has credibility issue with investors. The minute news came out that AAL pilots will have simulation training with 737 MAX despite previous assertion that they do not need it drop more. It is funny that it drops more than BA which has the problem or LUV which has a lrger number of 737 MAX.
Ignore all fake trades and just ask the same ole question if AAL will close above $53 again?Airlines so far have all reported decent earnings and we haven’t priced in much of the tax benefits; oil is overdue for huge correction and as soon as they Start Broadcasting 10m bpd production it Will strat a sustainable retreat. Two consecutive 10m bpd production with continuous uptick on rig count will have serious effect on the oil price!

"Here is my opinion on what's happening currently! For the last two and half hours, the bulls are trying to push the price upward but it's not happening. Since the buy seems to be weaker and the overall market is not upbeat, you may assume the stock price may move further down before the closing. However, there has to be stock price rise at some point next week. It's going to be short lived. If you are long or want to have a long position with AAL, this is my bet: I'd have placed some call and written some put options as well. I tend to believe the stock price will be up to $14.65. I see that short interest is high, options volume is low. This's my take on this stock for the coming days. Can this stock go much lower that it already is? Yes, the chart suggests it but again the shorts will be taking a lot of risks by pushing the price further down particularly if the good news keeps coming about the market. Also, let's not forget the fact that the trading volume got really high in the beginning of the June. I see it as a negative circumstance for the shorts, meaning there are other players ""crowdfunds"" that can be a game changer and you never know when they make their play."
"OK, I just bought some. I have no idea what the price will end at today, but how can you not buy when it's irrationally cheap. Just because you think it will get even cheaper? Sure that could happen, but it can't stay irrational forever."
Buffett has not sold any AAL.(or he sold & bought)

"Street EPS estimate dropped 9 cents, revenue was up a tiny bit. Based on guidance of Jet Fuel $2.18-$2.23, against current quarter todate avg, it is possible that Jet Fuel will be around $2.29/gal if WTI stays the same for the rest of the quarter.$2.29/gal is about 8c/gal over midpoint guidance of $2.21/gal. It's about $92m higher Jet Fuel Cost, or 0.8% lower margin.$92m short of estimated $11,725m revenue is really not much, even it cuts more cents off EPS due to low share counts.It is amazing to see AAL lost so much of market cap for $92m higher costs."
And how do they expect to get back the business traveler who flies out for a meeting and then is expected to quarantine for 14 days and not go back to work. It's impossible for the airlines to increase their numbers until the states/Governors relax their quarantine rules.
American Airlines is up 8.64% to 25.39
Time for Carl Icahn to come in and unlock shareholder value. AAL would be trading at $45/share with the right management team.
"I’m tired of seeing posts about debt. American had debt when they were trading at $30.00. Do you really think that debt means anything at this point? No, it doesn’t. What matters is the death rate, which has dropped significantly. The only reason why cases are higher is because they started testing more people. Nothing realistically has changed."
"1.3 million passengers passed through TSA checkpoints on Monday, making over one million for 2 weeks straight. Why are the airlines taking a hit? Doesn't make any sense to me."
"TSA show 23 days in a row with Over 1m passengers traveling, the trailing 7-day was 1.401m/day, the 1st 2 days in April PAX was average 64.03% of 2019, the trend is going Up and Up.Over 101,804,762 adults have taken at least 1 shot, 74.38% adults >=65 have taken shorts, 39.23% adults >=18 also have taken at least 1 shot. At current Speed 80% of adults >=18 will be vaccinated by end of May.Uncle believes with increasing vaccine delivery from the 3 drug companies, we may not even have to wait too long."
We won’t close anywhere close to above 24 due to manipulation.

"Assuming AAL and most of the other airlines survive this mess, how do they plan for the future? Are they supposed to keep a whole years worth of revenue just in case something like this happens again? It would take them 10-15 years to accumulate that much in earnings. Talk about a dead investment. Virtually everyone in the media just loves to hate the airlines. Perhaps the major airlines should just shutdown for 3 months and let everyone drive or take a train (a real treat). They could keep their furloughed employees on healthcare and dump them on to unemployment. (They have paid unemployment taxes for years for just his kind of contingency)Not_A_Short"

"i believe this stock is a piece gold and its covered by dust, which needs to be just cleaned only. AAL will land in its right price = 20s. who agree?"
"So as I noted yesterday, it's become a Captain Obvious observation that AAL is now making a lot of money. And there are no signs that this will stop, and there's plenty of evidence that AAL's cash flow will be rapidly increasing in the next year with lower capital expenditures. Yet, the stock is trading like they're going out of business. Will the Market find a new excuse to depress the stock price now? Maybe Chinese exports -- even though weak Chinese exports further INCREASE AAL's profitability by reducing fuel cost? The fact that you can not count on ""reality"" here makes investing extremely risky -- much riskier than the actual business."
"AAL has shed a third of it value in a week, and is worth 1/4 of DAL, 1/2 of UAL and 1/3 of LUV.All credits go to ""Dougie-Debt"" Parker' ""genius"" risk management strategy of entering a recession with all AAL' assets leveraged to the hilt with little to no FCF.What next?Are we going to hear soon about:1/ the generous raises he's given to the unions to reward them for crippling AAL' operations last summer? 2/ how he's bought back more shares at 40% above market price?"
wow.... what a finish... more than 4% ... heading to 5%.

"AAL short interest is 171,336,981 as of December 31st, up from 160,823,723 two weeks before that. It has increased by 10.5M shares (6.5%) in the second half of December and 29.5M shares (20.8%) during the same month. Now let’s take a look at what has happened since 10/31, and how price reacted in relation to the change in short interest level:Closing date, increase/decrease (shares), stock price, increase/decrease 12/31 => 171.34M, 29.5M (20.8%), $15.77 (11.6%)11/30 => 141.85M, -30.9M (-17.9%), $14.13 (25.27%) *10/31 => 172.77M, NA, $11.28, *Keep in mind that the reduction in the short interest level occurred in the first half of November however the stock price continued to increase another 15.4% in the second half of November. These figures should remind short-sellers that there are new buyers and also bulls have probably increased their positions in the last two months. Even though almost 31M more shares were bought back in the early part of the month of November, a catalyst for the increase in AAL’s share price, the price gain was higher in the second half of the month. In contrast, the short interest increased in December however AAL’s share price continued to go up. I also like to reiterate what I said in my comment on December 9th that there was going to be a sell off that would cause a decline in AAL’s share price before the end of the year. There was a 20.6% decrease in share price. I kept reminding of possibility of a sizeable shorting last week however I didn’t think it has occurred yet. I thought the short interest level was same or within two-percentage points in either direction in comparison to the figure registered on December 15th. I still think that a large percentage of shorting may occur following a steady decline in price and volume within 4 to 8 weeks based on the trend, and we are in the fifth week. So when I look at this developments, I notice that the AAL stock is resilient despite the fact we had a year-end period during which 29.5M more shares were shorted yet the AAL’s shares has lost between 15% to 20% in value depends on how you analyze it. AAL stock appeals to new buyers along with the long position holders of AAL shares, which begs the questions,Will AAL stock resilience discourage speculators to short any further? Do short sellers know something that we do not? Their attempt has failed to bring the share price down in the last two months. They’ve got to be really convinced of AAL going bankrupt or something!"
These stocks just pull at the open trade sideways all day and pull at close or sputter up a little. sad

I got laughed at when I bought calls on Monday. Keep chasing overvalued tech. Airlines were way oversold. Can’t believe this was in the 10’s on Monday

Institutions have concluded airlines are not an investment. They are a proxy for the price of oil so they are exiting left and they won't be coming back as long as the airlines profitability is dependent upon the wild swings of the price of a barrel of oil. That's why American Airlines has lost over 30% of its value in one month. It is basically a commodity play now.
"for now, let it slide. when the second stimulus comes this will move up considerably, and finally once there is news of successful vaccine, AAL will skyrocket to the moon. mark my words."

"Lots of analysts/commentators keep bashing the airlines. Given the recent hyperbolic run-up, I don't blame them. But at the end of the day, the airlines have only 2 real problems: the virus, and the possible election of Biden. Personally, I'm now more worried about the latter. The virus fear will be almost completely gone by the end of the month. It's just data. We have a nursing home disease now that is waning. Then we will have to deal with some social and economic lunacy from the left.BTW, for those who want to see what ""the virus does,"" look at this well-presented daily report from Massachusetts. They were hit early and pretty hard from NYC. It's not really different than any other Western place hit by the virus. You can see who dies, and how long it takes for the virus to run its course.

"I don't understand how American Airline is still in business with the number of flight cancellations that's going on. If you CANNOT FLY people out to their destinations, stop offering these routes as bookable. Our flight was cancelled two days in a row and based on our observations, American Airline had so many cancellations due to miss management or their lawsuit against their Mechanics Unions that they should just stop booking people onto their flights. These unions should be sued, America is ruined by these greedy unions who don't want to work and just want benefits and pay"
"If the Board acts quickly, there’s nothing so permanently broke that Parker successor can’t fix OTHER THAN the HORRIFIC reputation. But THAT can be fixed over months and years of time:A.) restoring some semblance of positive relationship with employees.B.) vastly improving customer service to flyers.But it all starts with booting Parker & Isom. Then the long road to recovery can begin and AAL can win! Time is short."

"Parker SHOULD NOT negotiate early with the Pilots. At this juncture Parker should keep in mind that a recession may be around the corner and thus prepare for it and raising Pilot wages early is not a good idea. Parker can learn from Mary Barra of GM, eliminating several models because of dwindling demand or preference for other type of models such as crossovers...Parker must aggressively cut unprofitable routes and redeploy assets where it is most profitable. Also, Parker must now review AAL's strategy of being the largest but not the most profitable. I can never understand why being the most profitable is the goal, not being the largest! So in essence, start cutting routes and costs and the issue of Pilot, Flight Attendants wages will show itself when the goal is profitability not size matters. Parker can put everyone on notice that until AAL is as profitable as the most profitable airline, then no raises are warranted...everyone must contribute including management. Period."

"There's no constituency to champion this, but if you actually study the data (I've been doing it for months), you understand that EVERYTHING our gov't does in response to the virus is ineffective. The only thing that MIGHT have mattered is closing down European travel earlier (I advocated it more than a week before it was done, but I understand why the politicians didn't move as fast). The infection level in NYC basically seeded the whole country, and it's acted like a ""slow moving invisible cloud"" across the country. First it was an infection wave, and now it's a ""healing"" wave. With a handful of especially seeded infection hot-spots (like Mardi Gras and Detroit and SoFla), the further away you are from NYC, the smaller number of infections you have. The further you are also means you got the virus peak later, and now you're getting the healing later. It's why NYC cases/hospitalizations dropped like a rock first in NYC, and then the healing wave started washing over NJ and CT, and then things started getting better in Philly, and now things are sliding down the curve in Boston and DC. This NYC epicenter clearly controls the infection and healing from New England to Minneapolis to North Carolina, and probably the country as a whole. It's why the virus hasn't quite peaked (at low levels) in California and AZ. It's all science, but nobody wants to say anything about it because they don't really understand why the virus does this and it doesn't support a narrative they want."

"The devil is in the details, but I think the ALK may be even a ""bigger deal"" than most industry observers believe. And I think that's because of LAX. ALK is in Terminal 6. AAL operates right next door in Terminals 4 and 5, with some flights out of the Int'l Terminal All these terminals are now easily connected airside. The idea of AAL having a LAX hub always seemed good, but it never seemed like they'd have enough critical mass there. With the ALK code share, LAX is now A Big Deal for AAL. The ALK partnership can even help AAL's ""forgotten"" PHX hub, and makes the two carriers a dominant force in the Western USA. This seems absolutely brilliant. The long term problem, of course, is how to keep both parties happy."
UAL should make an offer to buy AA's Miami hub.
"Did you see this?China Travel AdvisoryThursday, the State Department issued a travel advisory recommending ""increased caution"" on travel to China, citing authorities' use of ""exit bans"" that prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving the nation. The move follows increased trade and political tensions between the U.S. and China, something else weighing on markets more broadly.The State Department warned that China uses exit bans to ""compel U.S. citizens to participate in Chinese government investigations,"" lure people back to China, and provide other assistance to authorities. U.S. citizens can be kept in China ""for years,"" as a result of the exit bans, the department said.""In most cases,"" the department said, ""U.S. citizens only become aware of the exit ban when they attempt to depart China, and there is no method to find out how long the ban may continue.

"I see that Amazon has told employees to avoid all non-essential air travel, including domestic, because of the virus. That's some pretty good panic. There's far more danger of their employees slipping in a bath tub at home than there is of travelling the USA right now. There just aren't any virus cases at all, yet alone a meaningful number that would warrant caution. Are we all supposed to crawl under our beds until there are zero worldwide cases?"
"Trump said the stock market has increased 30% since he took office, the best gauge is actually by the Wilshire total market cap, and I would say the market is $2.327T bigger or 9.8% gain. During the same period we got a $3.8T tax cut and $3.7T stock buybacks plus dividend payments, so do we read from it? Tax cuts went into stock buybacks and dividends or we get $3.7T ""Return to Shareholders"" plus $2.327T gains on the stocks? Who gets all the added debts?"
"Investors Day starts in a little less than an hour.Parker don't be silent, be a promoter!"
"The long CNBC interview was both interesting and informative this morning. For the first time since this crisis began, shareholders have a tiny bit of clarity. The company now has plenty of cash, and there are no longer any real liquidity problems (assuming the world isn't in lockdown in 2021, of course). Parker is being cautious in predicting a recovery, expecting it to begin slowly in Q3 and remain slow for the rest of the year. Nothing wrong with being conservative about that -- especially with so much of the company's business being int'l, which will be slower to recover.Now that the company's finances are secure, the real attention will shift to the virus and recovery. I think there will be plenty of surprises ahead with the virus: most of them should be good. It seems obvious that the mortality rate is WAY overstated, and that lots of people have had the virus and have no idea whatsoever. We may get to mortality rates that aren't that much higher than the flu. We'll have to see, but we'll know more in the next couple of weeks. The speed of the airline recovery is in direct proportion to the speed at which humans feel comfortable about being around other humans, and that's still a hard number to model.I do now think that 12 bucks is a reasonable price for AAL. Indeed, if this was a normal stock, I'd recommend buying it at that price. But so many times this stock trades WAY below what is a reasonable price, so it's really hard to guess the valuation. We may get a short term bump from shorts exiting: this stock is a TERRIBLE short now unless you truly believe the apocalypse is upon us -- and you're going to need to see a very surprising resurgence in the virus to get that. Otherwise, if you watch the progress with the virus, you may be able to predict the stock price here."
I’m so mad at myself right now. I sold 1000 shares at $13 yesterday morning and now kicking myself.

"As I read the media coverage, it seems likely that Trump's success at Davos is going to add more fuel to the fire of the American Economic Boom and, relatedly, drive the stock market even higher. I think I can safely say that the US airline industry has never done badly in an economic boom -- yet alone one that was centered in the USA, but extended its reach worldwide."
"Regular readers may remember that I was supposed to fly to China later this month. Once Europe started looking like Wuhan and China basically banned all foreigners, that plan went up in smoke. But I was still curious to see the current regulations for checking into a Beijing hotel. I sure hope this isn't the future of travel. According to thebejinger website:(4/10 4.39pm) Hotels Now Require Covid-19 Test: Anyone coming to Beijing from outside the city must present certification that they have tested negative Covid-19 within the last 7 days in order to check into a hotel, city officials announced today. At this point the policy does not appear to affect those of us already in Beijing. All arrivals are now automatically tested for Covid-19 during their first two weeks in Beijing, which they must spend in quarantine at home or in a government-appointed central facility."

"Did you see the comment someone made that if AAL bought back $11 bln of stock, the market cap of the company should be $11 bln higher? If this is the typical level of intelligence of the average investor/trader of this stock, no wonder the stock price is always all over the place."
"7-day moving average ending 3/7 was 1,016,623, higher than 7-day ending 2/28 of 962,242 and 2/22's 929,646. Uncle believes reporting 7-day moving average including low Tuesdays and Wednesdays is better for the trend watching. For the current quarter to yesterday, total PAX was at 41.51% or down 58.49% vs 2019. This compares to 4Q's down 63.23%, 3Q's down 71% and 2Q's down 90.33% is real improvement, besides we still have more than 3 weeks to go."
AAL has 152 million shares shorted out of 600milion shares outstanding. That is about 25%. It should move up higher from current price.

Chances of this going Red today? This is just funny
"Slimy fish lowering airlines pts , think would wait for aal update coming out today or tomorrow but that would make too much sense."
what you need to do is think about a snowball as a snowball starts rolling down the hill gravity accelerates and what happens is the same thing with your what with the same with AAL is people who have positions are starting to get scared and they want to sell out this causes more people wanting to sell out so finally you reached a crescendo in which the price of the stock is so low that it counteracts the people who are selling with the people who are buying so this is not really having to do with fundamentals has more to do with emotion and reaction
how is oil up when the market is tanking and abuzz about recession and the collapse of the world economy? You would think that oil would be down massively too.
South Korea thus far reporting a low number hopefully a low number will come out of them. Hopefully less than 400 we are getting very close for them to start reporting a climb in recoveries.

(AAL) is currently at $20.90, up $2.23 or 11.91%-- Would be highest close since Feb. 26, 2020, when it closed at $22.31-- On pace to close above the June 8, 2020 high for the first time-- On pace for largest percent increase since Nov. 9, 2020, when it rose 15.18%-- Currently up five of the past six days-- Currently up two consecutive days; up 18.04% over this period-- Best two day stretch since the two days ending Nov. 24, 2020, when it rose 18.28%-- Up 21.75% month-to-date-- Up 32.56% year-to-date-- Down 64.25% from its all-time closing high of $58.47 on Jan. 12, 2018-- Down 17.86% from 52 weeks ago (Feb. 24, 2020), when it closed at $25.45-- Down 17.86% from its 52-week closing high of $25.45 on Feb. 24, 2020-- Up 131.25% from its 52-week closing low of $9.04 on May 15, 2020-- Traded as high as $21.11; highest intraday level since Jan. 28, 2021, when it hit $21.77-- Up 13.01% at today's intraday high; largest intraday percent increase since Jan. 28, 2021, when it rose as much as 31.46%-- Third best performer in the S&P 500 today-- Most active stock in the S&P 500 today"
Disappointing compared to pre market action
12% for borrowing money for a company if that size is an individual borrower paying his local pawn shop 45% interest. This is a bad sign like Cramer says! Was interested in trading stock but not now!
"In the best economy in a decade, AAL has, in just one quarter, lost 27% of it's value. Hats off to Parker as he continues to reward himself (and the BOD) with more shares and they authorize more money into the buyback shredding machine.On May 5th, Buffett will hold a shareholder meeting, I wonder where this stock price goes if and when he exits AAL?"
I just want tendies
"Very low volume in airlines throughout this selloff. There is no news to trade, just broad market fear. We REALLY need a good traffic report from DAL tomorrow. We also need a good earnings season. 2Q is looking a lot better and oil prices are contained. What we don't need is a broad trade war that actually affects air traffic, or other contagion from the broad market selloff, which is more and more of a risk. But the actual fundamentals and earnings of Airlines still look good. AAL still has a forward PE of 8...."

That was quite a drop today . Hmm
AAL is Heading to $59.40 by September....
Don’t sell This the same thing that happened to GME
"Oil Rig Count remains the same last week, Permian Up 4, Eagle Ford down 1."
3 month chart Looks very good
"Was anyone here for that short squeeze when they announced 1,000 flights being added daily in July?"
Power hour hold and load Gentlemen’s 
"If The price in January is reflecting the true value ( not sure it wasn't over priced then), and from hearing that air traffic this year will be between 50-25 percent of what it was, then if it was $35 in January, then a price of 10-15$ is realistic price to what it is worth right now isn't it?, until we back to normality . Only My assumption. I will definitely buy some if it goes to $8"
Very bullish candle stick today. Most likely wit will cross the 200 SMA tomorrow
"The stock price is higher during the after market trading hours unlike last few. I've said earlier I was going to remind you ""I TOLD YOU SO!"" *Desperate times call for desperate measures.*"
Check out the relationship of debt to the percentage drop from the 52 week high. Looks like AAL has more to drop:stock price 52 wk high % drop debt (B)AAL 46.78 59.08 20.82 25.07UAL 70.84 83.04 14.69 14.39DAL 54.85 60.79 9.77 9.71
"I've been watching today's launch of LUV's service to Hawaii with some interest. Despite what some uninformed media reports say, the launch is of no concern to the Big Boys (but certainly of some concern to HA and probably ALK). This feels like LUV's last hurrah to me. They should have been in Hawaii years ago and, given their strong customer base on the West Coast, the service should be successful. I'm kind of expecting to see Hawaiians with tons of stuff at ticket counters on the West Coast taking advantage of WN's overly generous free two-carry-on policy (kind of in the way you see such stuff in MIA on some Latin flights).I don't think these routes will make a ton of money, however, and I don't know what else LUV can do next. AAL, for example, can deploy it's new widebody fleet around the world, assuming there's some demand for it. LUV's model only works for leisure on longer haul service. The Caribbean's already awash in service. Point-to-point is definitely going to be more challenging for them with Spirit and Frontier. We'll see."
"Last chance to Load up, under $22. Just added 1033 shares."
"Prediction. We will close below 24 today to wipe out over 90,000 options as worthless. From 24 all the way up to 30."
"Nailed oil , nat gas , steel and now gold Next place to go is back to airlines AAL best to trade and own Now international is opening back up AAL is same consid chart as X before harvesting that on this last move Go big on AAL trade starts NOW IMO"
Shorts seems to be somehow in charge but in reality the company is recovery for sure. We area all aware that the Simple rule of supply and demand applies here. For long term shorts are in trouble and we all feel that is the lowest is reached at this point.
"US spot jet fuel closed yesterday at the lowest price of the year: $1.85. Fuel is, by far, the single most important short term component of airline profitability. Really, the only other thing that could screw things up (other than the known MAX expenses) are an unreliable operation. We had a small blip with the mechanics last week, but they're doing their jobs again and the operation is fine. For example, today, AAL has so far cancelled only 6 flights in the entire system. By contrast, LUV -- who supposedly ""solved"" their reliability issues by making a deal with their mechanics, has cancelled 64. Just like in the oil market, ""facts"" often don't matter in the short term. In the long term, they do."
"Ladies and gentleman when your done filling your pockets with the free cash, please be seating and buckle your seatbelts. We will be continuing our upward ascent shortly"
BA absolutely saved Parker’s job in 2019. HUGE diversion from operational issues.
"I am so discouraged with AAL now. I got in at 16.20 and now wondering if I will ever see my money again. Anyone here still has high hope on AAL? I need encouragement, please."
we can create a major short squeeze for An American company and then they can gain capital with a stock offer
"I have been trying to post my comment for more than a few hours now. It's totally frustrating. $AAL has shown his muscles yesterday: steadily moving or maintaining its price. I liquidated a small volume at $21.75 in after market yesterday to write some put options and have cash available for other stocks. Today, it dropped! Well, I intended to use the revenues elsewhere (see the new ticker below) but now AAL selling puts slightly away from the day's bottom becomes attractive and that's what I have just done which is also what I have said last Friday: ""(I'll) write short term PUTs not too far away from ATM when the stock dips a few percentages."" For example, I sold the shares at $21.75(I shared my opinion on AAL's share price last week). I don't think this stock will rise sharply in the coming weeks. So When $AAL price dropped to $20.70, I wrote 3/19 @19.50 (premium is 45 cents). Either I will own the stocks slightly above 12% discount in two weeks or the shares I have sold yesterday will gain 45 cents ($21.75+.45 = $22.20). When $AAL is trading about 5% down from $21.75, the share needs to gain 7% to get to $22.20 in two weeks). If it doesn't succeed, I gain a big edge on the stock. Guess what? The biggest edge is taking a bigger risk next time that I couldn't dare earlier. The worst scenario would be less gain but not loss of previous gains.I have been busy with $RKT since mid last week and opened a position. Looks like more might be added by Friday unless the price exceeds $26 by then. My strategy is in place, trying to gain edge and I am a step ahead at the moment before I increase my long position. In addition, here is another company I am interested in as of this evening! Ticker symbol is FCX. Freeport-McMoRan. if you know anything, feel free to share it.I have noticed the ticker FCX just this evening as I was going over some stocks that were mentioned positively by Goldman Sachs way back in January 2019. I started to do some cleaning of old documents/articles under my stocks screening tab. I was supposed to read and monitor the performances of these stocks. Most of the prices of the mentioned stocks in the article are way up including FCX. Out of all the ones in GS's suggestions, FCX appeals to me the most thus far. So I started analyzing the stock. I have never read or heard on FCX previously but currently doing my due diligence. Lots of to read, dig, understand but based on what I have learned thus far, I think the stock price may soon bounce back. Just giving heads up! Appreciate the knowledge/info you all share.So far things that appeal to me are:- Low margin requirement- Stock price is low-Stock price has declined- Revenues-Operating income-EBITDA-Growth-Price for Copper material is on the rise and expected to close higher by the end of the yearP.S. FCX was down over 4% earlier as I expected but now it is down just below 3%. I expect to create an entry point 5% below today's low.Cheers."

you think this can turn into GREEn by EOD?
My timing is probably off as usual but I liquidated a half of my AAL shares at closing price yesterday and the remaining just an hour ago. I decided to short the stock for a quick buck. Put another order at $29.21 unless it retreats and I switch back to long again.
"Personally, I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea that it's great to buy stocks -- except travel stocks. The world is gonna be just great, but nobody is going to travel? I mean, that's dumb as dirt, except from perhaps a trading perspective.It also boggles my mind that cruise lines -- including Carnival (owner of the Diamond Princess) are doing better than airlines. Let's get real: once the virus fears subside, almost nobody is going to have ""a problem"" getting on an airplane. But the cruise industry? C'mon. At a minimum, we're looking at 2 years of reduced bookings, and almost a certain decline in the idea that a cruise makes for a great vacation. This is Psychology 101 -- it should be impossible to miss. And yet the Market is missing it."
Here is Think dancing for his man............
"10-K Cash Flows from investing activities:The old Proceeds from Sale of property and Equipment and Sale-Leaseback transactions is broken down into:Proceeds from Sale-Leaseback transactions andProceeds from Sale of Property and EquipmentThis gives us the itemized Sale-Leaseback Transaction Amount.Parker defines Free Cash Flow as Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures + Proceeds Sale-Leaseback TransactionAAL 2019 FCF = $3,815 - $4,268 + $850 = $397mAAL's Operating Cash Flow was reduced by $1.23bn in Pension Contribution which will be significantly reduced (like $700m less) in 2020. It does Help the Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow. AAL's reducing pension obligation by $980m in 2019 has reduced its ""Adjusted Debt"" down and increased Funding Status to 70.31%, Up from 61.38%."
"Massive short squeeze sent AAL up high in the sky today. Thanks a lot, shorts!"
"Fun fact. The Diamond Princess had something like 735 infections (I haven't seen a final number as several of these occurred in quarantine outside of Japan). I think the total death count is about 10 (again, you'd have to add a few to the official number of 6). Think about that. This is a VERY elderly subset of people -- all of whom were constantly tested. So what is the real mortality rate of corona across an average group of people? I'd put my money on well under 1%. The world isn't going to end."
Jake panicked awwww
"Who sold the stock earlier today is probably crying now, tomorrow $22.50"
Will tank hard on monday.
"What's interesting here is that Parker is now essentially promising NOTHING, other than math. While he expresses optimism about the direction of the business, he's making no real promise to improve revenue performance or anything else. He's just going to run the business and see what happens -- which we know will be buying back stock and paying off debt. Is that a good psychological strategy for the Market? I don't know. Psychology is hard to game."
Should you invest in Turkey?
Today is the day of Airlines !!!!EXCEPT this one ...... :-(
"The stock price goes up(?!?!) because AAL gets the opportunity to add $6.5B to its already too high debt? No one is going to pay to sit in the middle seat for quite a while, so that's 1/3 of the plane empty. Questions:1/ AAL had problems making profit when planes were full and the economy was good, how will it perform when the planes aren't full and the economy is weak?2/ when will AAL generate enough revenue to pay the bills AND pay the debt interest on $42B+, mid 2021?3/ will the ""genius"" CEO Parker still be running this company - the guy that elevated the debt by leveraging every asset to buyback shares at $40/share?4/ Why invest when there's no dividend for a while and a possible dilution (when/if Parker can't pay back the grant money)?5/ How much will Parker need to borrow or dilute shares to run the business at a loss after October 2020?"

No upside left........................ going short here.
"Today the BOD should award Parker a special medal.AAL gets a new 52 week low AND meets the price it closed at on 12/9/2013, it's first trading day post-merger. After almost 6 years, AAL share price has gained 0% while the company has lost $8B in market cap and increased its debt by $8B.You can buy a share today for what it cost 6 years ago, and that's after Parker's $11B stock buyback program. What a waste of money and AAL gets to pay the interest for many years to come."
After 10:45. I dip you dip we dip! I’m waiting to get back in at $19
$25 seems to be a reasonable bottom by the end of May.
Parker's bet and strategy by incurring debt has placed this airline in the worst position of the legacies and clearly will be the first to declare bankrupcy....my bet is within 18 - 24 months they will be out of choices
"Buffet already has 10m shares in AAL. He won't be selling since he's getting Dal shares, meaning he doesn't see airline industry going down. Guy is probably buying more lol. Cheap fuel, lay offs and no extra capacity due to max is going to work out good."
"That is it, market has priced out any extension of federal support and the passing of the election might not help.

They continue to gain 36.67% this week vs. 35.54% prior week.Had my first trip in a month yesterday was surprised by the increase in activity & the lack of fear around the terminals and these were in some very left hand airports. Had a 90%+ full 777 and E175. It is a long haul, but the trend is clear."

I’m hoping for $9 so I can add more
"I think very few stock traders know this, but Beijing is only averaging about 2 new coronavirus cases a day now. There are probably many more than that, but I think we can certainly assume that the virus is not running rampant in Beijing. We get plenty of reports from the large expat community that confirm this. There are more than 21 million people in Beijing, and their hygiene standards and medical facilities are vastly inferior to anything in the USA. If Beijing doesn't have much of a coronavirus problem, it seems like a horrific bet to think this virus is going to explode in the USA. That's just basic common sense."
"Nobody on Wall Street seems to actually pay attention attention to airline operations, but my hunch is that if AAL can figure out how to deploy a greater portion of its widebody fleet to domestic use this spring and summer, it will materially increase its earnings. With the MAX grounded through at least summer, there's definitely going to be a domestic seat ""shortage."" There will not be an int'l seat shortage."
why would anyone hold this now whether 1 share or 1 million shares?
"AAL continues its Baby-Step forward as the PAX data supports the Great idea of slowly but surely recovery.That said, it ain't Summer time yet, USA is going to get 240m doses of Vaccine by end of March, many State have started giving Vaccine to teachers, Caretakers, and soon the General Public will be able to get the shots.Total population >=18 is only 254m, 240m Vaccine including 20m from JNJ can take care of 130m people, that's 51.1%. By 5/31 there will be 420m doses, including 80m from JNJ to cover 250m people.Man, we may have to Pay people to get the Vaccine Shots..."
"""Southwest downgraded to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs analyst Catherine O'Brien downgraded Southwest Airlines to Sell and lowered her price target for the shares to $54 from $66.""Very Rare to See a straight SELL recommendation with Target lower than current stock price.Vertical Research just gave Buy on LUV, Sell on AAL recently, and this one is completely opposite to have AAL a Buy and LUV a SELL. In real life, LUV has gone up so much so fast recently while AAL has been down to become Too Bad to be Worse Stock, guess it's a fair call.The analyst expects Southwest's Hawaii launch to pressure its margins in the near-term."

This means that today you're buying AAL at %75 of the price it was pre-pandemic. (25% discount).Also, the differences are:2019 had dividend - 2020 has no dividend for a long time2019 has share buy back - 2020 has no share buybacks for a long time2019 had bad debt - 2020 has way worse debt2019 had more flights/planes - 2020 has less planes/flightsI'm waiting for $17/share to purchase $40k worth of put options for end of 2021.

"FED news must be OK to good, everyone is climbing sharp. up. Powell announcement delayed till 1pm tommoorow? lets go to the moon!!"
The media has managed to create panic in the general public. There needs to be a class action lawsuit for this way overblown media hyped coronavirus scare. Everyone knows what's behind it. The media has been looking for some way to cause a recession since President Trump took office. They made a terrible mistake. They've damaged people's pocketbooks they will take their vengeance on the medium at the polling booth. Especially since the market will have long recovered from this by November. And especially since the public knows that if there were a democrat in office the coverage of the coronavirus should be how well the government is handling not how bad this pandemic is going to be. The media are fools and they are a Democrat accomplice. I'm buying American airlines at these pricing all airlines at these prices. I will be buying early in the morning and if it goes a little bit lower it's hard to call the bottom on crazy.
"Omg, it’s happening"
Feel the equity markets have not fully understood all the vaccine and therapy results from yesterday; there were too many results and news at one time. We are 4-5 months away from effective vaccines and delivering to people as vaccines are being manufactured now while we proceed with phase 3 trials. If the markets are forward looking I expect cyclical stocks like aal and nclh to significantly appreciate in coming weeks.
"Talk about a lack of love: very surprising spike in TSA enplanements this weekend. I didn't expect to see improvement for 2 more weeks. But if market doesn't care, be careful. Airline stocks can stop trading on fundamentals, and I've noticed that behavior the past month. Something will eventually jar the market back to fundamentals, though."
"This Moderna news is absolutely nothing new. It was just a formal publication of the same data they alluded to in May that caused their share price to jump so they made more from their public offering.

I am going to say it again these stop orders are a self fulfilling prophesy...

"I'm out flying this weekend (on AA!) and it makes me wonder: do stock traders fly? They must, right? I would think they're in the right demographic. I haven't flown much this summer (at least for me) and I was somewhat surprised at the airport last night. I thought we might be winding down the peak summer rush but, jeez, it's really busy out there. I saw so many people on the TSA line that I was wondering if there was some sort of computer breakdown (nope -- that was at Customs yesterday!). I asked the TSA agent who processed me, and the agent at the lounge, whether it was a particularly night. ""Nope,"" they both said. ""It's been like this all summer.""Meanwhile, I'm looking at the stats for today and, right now, AAL has all of 3 flights cancelled in the entire system. Out of thousands. And yet, at this stock price, folks worry about ""labor tensions.""\I just can't reconcile the ""real world"" with the stock market. Wall Street seems to have lost its #$%$ mind."

Bottom line... As the vaccines increase and bailouts for Airlines in the cards I see much higher prices for all the airlines.
"Too much good news this weekend....even President-elect Bloomburg news is reporting it:U.S. Plans First Vaccinations in Weeks, Warp Speed Head Says“On the 11th or on the 12th of December, hopefully the first people will be immunized across the United States, across all states, in all the areas where the state departments of health will have told us where to deliver the vaccines,” Moncef Slaoui, head of the government’s Operation Warp Speed, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.Current plans envisage another milestone around May: a 70% immunization fate across the U.S., which “would allow for true herd immunity to take place,” said Slaoui, a former head of GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccines operation. “Most people need to be immunized before we can go back to a normal life.”While an effective vaccine is expected to be widely distributed in the U.S. 2021, hurdles remain. An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration is meeting on Dec. 10 to discuss emergency use authorization for a vaccine candidate. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have requested that authorization for their product."
Stocks are not manipulated. It goes down because there are more sellers than buyers. It’s cheap because Wall Street doesn’t believe in the management. Pure and simple. We’re also in tax loss selling position. Don’t expect much until January. They can’t fire the ceo till they find a good replacement. The company is worth 35 a share and will get back there next year.

"""We’re still negative on the airline sector (market underweight) because of compounding underlying capacity growth but we’re upgrading LUV from PP to OP ($57 TP) on a flight to quality concept.

"DAL purchases a few planes, a few shares AND raises the dividend, their valuation goes up to $39B, they truly do return value to shareholders. AAL purchases tons of planes, tons of shares, gives raises to all its employees, doesn't raise the dividend, and their valuation plunges to $14B. Now AAL as the largest airline is almost worth 1/3 of DAL, has massive debt, unhappy employees and unhappy shareholders.Meanwhile Parker and the Board of Directors have managed to reward themselves handsomely while dropping AAL' valuation in half and doubling the debt, returning negative value to shareholders."

"Anthony Fauci (the most trusted man in the world when it comes to infectious diseases) and his colleagues at the CDC said the following yesterday in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine:The evidence ""suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387?query=RPSo Fauci is saying the coronavirus is basically a bad flu.

"Very reasonable correction today, highlighting that oil is not putting much of a damper on airlines of late. Technically we are in an interesting spot relative to moving avgs, with the 50DMA at $33.91 the 100DBA at $34.10, and the 200DMA at 35.90, a level we've traded at as recently as late Feb. Since october we've tested the $30 low 3 times and it's held each time. meanwhile, the range continues to contract as we miss the 200 DMA by about $1 each of 3 attempts to break through. Now we're very constraint by the support and resistance levels of $30 and $36, and the more this range tightens the more of a coiled spring this stock can be, and it just makes less and less sense fundamentally for that to be to the downside. That all said, I agree with Herbie's inevitable comment that this is all meaningless...unless you are thinging about getting in now and want reasons to feel better about it."

Our country will never lockdown again. The traffic is incredible everywhere you go. People have learned to adjust to this virus and are traveling accordingly. Flights are improving each day. Airlines adding more flights each day. Death rates for this virus has gone way down as some hotspots occur which is very positive. The hotspots are controlled and taken down quickly. Phase 3 vaccines are starting up with many companies and are showing very positive results. Positive medications are working to reduce serious sickness. Many people are much more confident now to travel and move around. This stock is a outstanding BUYING opportunity. Do not miss out! We are about to fly. Easily to $16-$18 within the next couple of months. At least $20 by end of year. Good luck to all and take advantage of this great opportunity!

"Since the media is doing a horrific job covering the virus, I look at a lot of the daily data from the States. Every state I looked at today has declining hospitalizations. Yet, deaths and total cases are not declining. There's only one rational explanation to all this.

If the share price close below the opening price near Friday's closing price, be cautious. Tuesday will tell what direction the price will move. If the price close lower like over a dollar on Tuesday, then this may be very well the sign of a temporary downtrend.""

"American Airlines In Talks With Boeing To Defer 18 737 MAXsMAX aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2021, as the airline looks to conserve cash American had 24 MAX 8s in its fleet when the type was grounded in March 2019, A further 18 planes have already been built by Boeing and remain undelivered, bringing the tentative total to 42. The potential deferrals relate to an additional 18 MAXs that would take American’s total up to 60 aircraft by year end 2021. American CFO Derek Kerr said nothing firm has been agreed on yet, adding the company will likely have an update in time for its 2020 third-quarter earnings call in October.American has retired more than 150 jets in 2020, including five entire fleet types—its Airbus A330-300s, Boeing 757-200s, 767-300ERs, Embraer E190s and Bombardier CRJ200s—in addition to some of its older 737 NGs and A320ceos. As Kerr explained, the departures leave the airline with a much-simplified fleet consisting of just four core jetliner families; the 737 and A320 on the narrowbody side, and the 777 and 787 on the widebody side.“By getting our mainline fleet rationalized down to four main aircraft types, we’ve dramatically simplified the airline in terms of maintenance, flight operations and pilot training,” Kerr said.

"It is so frustrating to totally believe in the long term viability of a company, only to be faced with basically the one situation that could totally shake that belief: the black swan. The seem to happen every decade or so, one way or another. I suppose the good news is, it appears that despite AAL's debt load, all the airlines are really in the same boat. Either the government float them till this is over, or they don't. If the AAL domino falls the others won't be far behind in such a significant economic sudden stop."
Does anyone else think this is way overdone?

"43281 shares of Aal. I kept buying as it was falling. I hesitated a little yesterday, but I knew the markets were not pricing in the vaccine development. Today, the markets are realizing we will have at least 2 or maybe 3 phase3 trial results by December. The patient recruitment will not be an issue as we have so many cases and thus we may get early results soon. From phase 1 and 2 we know these vaccines are safe and produce neutralizing antibodies and T cell response so phase 3 is a matter of making sure that the vaccines work on 30,000 volunteers.

"U.S. Airline Unions Urge Lawmakers To Extend Subsidies Until March 31Airlines not so desperate this time, they will need much better terms to accept:WASHINGTON—Six unions representing a large cross-section of the U.S. airline industry have urged federal lawmakers to extend CARES Act payroll support until March 31, 2021, warning mass layoffs will be “inevitable” unless additional funds are forthcoming.Signed into law on March 27, the CARES Act provided airline employees and contractors $32 billion in grants and loans through the Payroll Support Program (PSP), the entirety of which went to employee pay and benefits through Sept. 30. Beyond that date, however, it is widely expected airlines will need to reduce head counts to realign their labor costs with lower travel demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.“Should Oct. 1 arrive without extending the PSP grant job program, mass layoffs are inevitable, as airline executives have acknowledged. Hundreds of thousands of workers will lose their jobs and health insurance—not only in aviation, but across our entire economy,” officials from the six unions wrote in a June 25 letter to House and Senate leadership.The letter’s signatories included officials from the Air Line Pilots Association, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, Communications Workers of America, International Association of Machinists andAerospace Workers, Transport Workers Union and the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.Draft legislative language shared by the unions calls for essentially doubling the payroll support funds provided across the industry. Passenger carriers would receive an additional $25 billion, while cargo airlines would get another $4 billion and contractors $3 billion more.“Only through an extension of PSP grants can Congress ensure that airline workers will continue to stay on payroll and ready to turn the industry around, prevent mass unemployment in October and keep aviation workers ready to lift off as travel picks back up,” the unions wrote.Airline executives repeatedly have stated they hope enough employees will accept voluntary-separation and early-retirement packages offered to reduce the need for layoffs following the cessation of CARES Act payroll support in October.A total of more than 100,000 employees at American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines already have accepted such offers, comprising nearly a third of their combined pre-pandemic workforce."

"I'm not sure it matters, but there's a narrative out there that the CDC screwed up ""big time"" by not getting enough virus testing kits out to the labs and hospitals. There were obviously problems with the early test kits, but it seems like the testing story is way more complex than this. Even had the kits been immediately manufactured, there might not be that much additional testing going on. Because -- surprise -- just because a state has test kits doesn't mean they know how to use them. From tomorrow's WSJ:______________But even as New York City said it didn’t have enough, New York state officials said the state has enough test kits for the moment.The state Department of Health said it had about 3,000 test kits available, which it considered to be an “ample supply,” a spokesman said. Roughly 300 tests have been conducted at the state’s Wadsworth lab since Sunday, the spokesman said. He added that the state could conduct tests on samples from New York City.The state can test about 500 samples a day, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo at a briefing Friday, and it hopes to increase its capacity to 1,000 samples a day. The bottleneck was laboratory capacity and not test kits, Mr. Cuomo said."
Eventually back $20 range soon!!
Wowwzer. Picked up another 200 shares on this dip along with 500 shares of spirit. Wait for vax to get circulated and people pump the summer window of vacation opportunity before fall lockdown and resurgence

"Unless there is news forthcoming it is hard to understand selling aal at five year lows as oil drops, air line travel increases amd the planes are flying full. Quite a few blast Parker but really, full airplanes, new fuel efficient fleet, there is not much more any ceo can do than keep the aircraft in the air and passngers in the seats. Take advantage of it when the markets undervalue your stock. Buyback. But another ceo? Not by me, planes full, etc. All a new ceo can do is screw that up."
aal going to suprise this week and next week can go to 25$ buy now!
"""Assuming a Brent oil price of $55/bbl in 2019 and real GDP +2.5%, history suggests U.S. airlines will report -1.0% y/y baseline RASM in 2019, all else equal. But all else is rarely equal. If domestic ASMs grow ~1.5pp above real GDP, as we assume here, a ~1.3pp negative modifier is added to the domestic portion of system RASM due to diminishing marginal returns. All in, our analysis suggests U.S. airlines will show a 2019 system RASM decline of 2-3% y/y with the current economic, oil, and capacity outlook. This would be worse than what’s currently in our models, to be clear, due to the fall in oil prices over the last few weeks. The recent macro-driven pullback is not why we downgraded airlines – that is “luck” – but we continue to expect key airline fundamentals to worsen in early 2019."" - King Fish's Speech Today.Key Words on 2019: ""RASM decline of 2-3%"", ""Airline fundamentals to worsen in early 2019""The second one regarding ""fundamental"" is for Senior to argue with."
I Wonder if Parker Will Share His Vision of AAL in the Post-Greg Era?
"Parker has indeed raised alarms in his management style and acumen for the key financials. One assessment I would like to see is the Cost/Benefit analysis prior to incurring this incredible debt. Basically, he felt new, more efficient and customer favored planes were needed. OK, what was the estimated cost over the planning horizon, what were the anticipated $$$ benefits and what do the numbers look like in 2019. Every major corporation does this and my company did it in exceptional details. Thus, for all those billions borrowed, how were you going to service the debt while also paying down the debt and for all the various investments such as the already mentioned planes, have you made a profit? Parker doesn't even touch debt in his public discussions and I am afraid his support teams helped him throw good money after bad. To make matters worse those Boeing 737s he bought are currently killing him. One or two mistakes you can give a guy a break but Parker seems to err more often than not. My bet is that Uncle Buffet will finally say enough is enough after Q2."
The Parker Countdown Clock.
"AAL has a new promotion that waives all change fees on tickets bought during the next 2 weeks. (FWIW, I suspect the rebooked tickets could incur additional charges if bought in a cheaper fare bucket that is no longer available). Obviously a smart promotion given the circumstances. And a great deal for consumers who might want to book tickets for late spring and summer."

It's really not normal for the Market to treat everything like the end of the world. It would be like a doctor ordering open heart surgery for a pimple. It's remarkable to me that the market has come to this. This isn't a game that can be played.
The airline stimulus should happen any time now and the stock will get a temporary bump up
Uncle and fellow MB kibitzers....I think we must consider rethinking AAL as the Rodney Dangerfield stock of the airline sector. It just doesn't get any respect except from Mongo man of course. It deserves better and should Mr. Parker announce a debt reduction plan I think that just might reverse sentiment.
"It forming reverse island pattern on the chart, very bearish"
"I wonder how much the CEO and other ""executives"" make?Shouldn't we be asking them those and other questions before giving them tax payer money?!With the amount of ""baggage fees"" and other bu|#$%$ fees that they gouge people for, they really should have enough money!"
"Well DAL and UAL managed to raise AAL stock price a little, something that AAL is unwilling to do; now there's nothing till the AAL CC call on the 4/26. Statistically the share price will drop before and going into the call and continue down afterwards, depending on Parker and his forward guidance. Parker's interaction with the analysts is always iffy and to the negative. Judging from Uncle's numbers AAL will not over-perform, so if you're not short trading this, brace for disappointment."
"Assuming november and december revenues do not take a hit ( as delta, ha and luv apparently have) I am estimating lower fuel if stays around current price till YE should add at least 50c to 4qs eps...my analysis must be wrong , if I was right how could King Fish(and the market) downgrade aal 15% in few days . King and the market are pricing in weak gdp, increased capacity and lower fares to wipe out fuel savings. Even in 2015 that did not happen and the e onomy wasnt going gangbusters that I can recall."
$30 by March 1st... undervalued compared to everything else.
You guys are too emotional when Stock going down the key to big profit in investment is long term not short.
“American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings Thursday and guided investors to a stronger performance in 2019 that it said would top its key competitors.” That is a bold statement Parker. Let’s see what you say on call. I am still waiting for my $60 PPS. Don’t give me the “we almost hit it” we want sustained price dude!!!

"My confidence is probably misplaced, but I have a feeling this will be a good week for AAL. Things have to get real and rational sometime, and there will be a lot of ""facts"" that will come out this week."
"Airlines shouldn't be treated as if it's same like overheated bubble tech stock, they are trying to recover from pandemic, and are undervalued right now, short will continue to short if shareholder keep selling into it, the airlines stock price shouldn't be this low, this is way manipulated, I WILL NOT SELL."
IMHO no reason not to hit 40.00.
"Total PAX for the quarter to yesterday was at 35.24% or down 64.76%, TSA reported PAX numbers were up 6 days in a row compared to prior weekdays, even after UAL and ALK complained about uncertainties on near-term bookings."

Uncle Buffett will start buying up cheap bonds ...
"Good morning Folks,The article linked to below provides a sobering look, behind the curtain, at the real American Airlines and just how precarious a financial position it is in. There is more money to be made trading AAL these days then there is in holding heavy and long, especially when you factor in the potential for bankruptcy protection if all of AAL's ducks don't line up perfectly in the coming months, and years.The good news is, AAL stock has seen a nearly 50% increase in the past week. However, don't be deluded into believing that this increase has anything to do with the company's true value, because it probably doesn't. The increase is related to the ""excitement"" over the coming government bailout/grant/loan. Without the ability to fly passengers around the country, this carrier is probably not worth much more that it was worth a week ago. It will simply have the cash to continue to pay furloughed employees, and the rent.We all should take to heart the old trader's adage, ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". I like AAL, don't get me wrong. But, not to hold long term. Just look at the beating that true, long term investors have taken by holding firm past couple of years. It was only the beginning of 2017 that AAL was channeling in the $40 to $60 range. It was in March of 2018 when, at $55, the slide into oblivion began, and just 12 months later the stock value had dropped by 40%, to the low $30's. The slide continued until mid-February of this year when the cerveza virus began its rout. During a short time period of just 4 weeks, AAL lost another 65% of its value.One might argue that the drop was an overreaction by the machines churning this equity, and arguably that would be a fair assessment. But the once proud carrier, which went from $55 just 24 months ago to $9 last week is hardly worthy of the kind of uber-bullish enthusiasm that so many on this board have aligned with recently.I'll continue to trade AAL. In fact, I have a semitrailer full of AAL LEAPS which I bought a week ago, and which I'll also likely be selling early this week; and I'll then rinse and repeat after the selloff which we will invariably see in the days following the official announcement of the bailout to American Airlines.I'll close with one final thought, a caveat if you will, which I am sure will draw some criticism, and that is, that AAL is not too big to fail.Good luck to all. Onward and upward.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-buy-american-airlines-114118817.html"

"Airlines has weakened since Kirby hyped the Rotten Core Cash Burn positive, UAL's Core Cash Burn is also one of his creative term excluding all the bad stuff, he's been enjoying his ATM machine since.JBLU priced its 0.5% convertible notes due 2026 and it looks like they'll fetch $750m at $25.92 conversion price."
"#TBTTimT13 days ago""One thing I have observed in a long time of trading is that these big price fluctuations and particularly, price going up ridiculously with no logical basis should be worrisome for many. This is also happening before Q2 report. That would mean, market-movers pulled the price as high as possible prior to possibly dumping the shares on the ordinary folks once again. They have already been doing it for a few days. For those who are optimistic about airline sector, ask yourself what the Q2 earnings will look like? I hope I am mistaken but if you are a short term long position investor on airline sector and particularly on AAL, you better be careful. A lot of things makes no sense in the market and trading equities is no longer what it was in the past. Trend does matter! If some big traders attract enough numbers and mobilize them like heard, they may achieve what they want. I have been long on ALL since March 2019, I locked in for the sale price of $15.55 due Friday. Yes, It looks like I got out too early and missed a great opportunity that could have tripled my gains. However, I believe I did better than Warren Buffett, who took a lot of loss and got out of the airlines. He is sitting on a lot of cash, he has been patient. His time will come. I'll be waiting to see the developments in the coming days. You need to pay attention to some developments in the overall market. The economist are estimating that the U.S. economy will shrink more than 30% for the quarter and over 5% for the year. Imagine airlines stock prices stayed low and they provided the quarterly financial reports. What do you think the stock price would have been then? But now, if it goes down, it goes down either to prior level or below, which means everyone including all big investors except short position holders lose. This was an opportunity for them to strategize their overall position with minimum damage or some profits. As I said in my previous posts, pricing will be based on manipulations and speculations until planes are flying with 80% and above. The debt is piling up for companies and consumers. 42 millions of lost jobs will not be regained in a short time while the presidential election is approaching. Hence, you trade base on speculation for the next 6 months. I called it back then, in the earlier period of the pandemic, when the big pricing fluctuations occurred that trading will resume based on speculations, and find the highest lowest figures for the period, $3-4 range, and get in and out of trades.Technology stocks have done well but they will be affected as well once the demand slows down for tech stocks. There are some who are immune to the recent crises but they are not many. Investors are going for those stocks because they seem to protect their money even if the gains may be small compare to the previous financial periods. ReplyReplies (7) 14 5"
"secondary offerings is one of the biggest ways to destroy small investors so i am not a big fan. instead of restricting small investors ability to trade, the brokers should allow companies to offer stocks only at premium to current market price.The stock offerings will strengthen their balance sheet and help them survive the current criisis.

Share price is just above the 52-week low in an excellent year for flying, economy booming with a 10% tax cut gift, S&P500 clipping its record high. Silly Parker, whatcha going to do? Cancel quarterly reports and borrow more money to buyback more shares? That's gonna make AAL look like a really attractive investment.Silly Parker."

"Vaccine news is important for the airlines. Many of the vaccine stocks have had huge moves, but most have been very quiet about their side effects. One of the vaccine companies has been much quieter about their results so far, but has virtually no side effects (some redness around the injection site). They avoid the self promotion of some of the others and are flying under the radar, but just started moving again. Watch INO for significant news release, as positive news about funding or Phase 1 results could light a fire under the airlines. Why? Because vaccine compliance will be poor unless there is a vaccine with minimal side effects."
Breaking News: Abdul the Mechanic had ISIS videos.
"(Bloomberg) -- American Airlines Group Inc. delayed deliveries of more than three dozen Boeing Co. aircraft for as long as three years and projected a deeper loss than analysts expected as the coronavirus pandemic continues to quash corporate and international travel.Eighteen 737 Max jets that were to be delivered this year and next will be postponed to 2023 and 2024, the carrier said in a regulatory filing Tuesday. American will also take fourteen 787-8 planes at the end of the next year’s first quarter, instead of this year. Another five of that wide-body aircraft will be converted to the 787-9 version, with shipment delayed until 2023.The first-quarter adjusted loss will be $4.29 to $4.41 a share, American said. Analysts had projected $4.05, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue will decline 62% from the same quarter in 2019, before the pandemic decimated travel. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company previously said the drop could reach 65%.American’s revenue projection meshed with a similar outlook from United Airlines Holdings Inc. as increased vaccinations against Covid-19 fuel a rebound in domestic flying. International and business demand has stagnated at as much as 80% below 2019 levels, however.The optimism over domestic travel was dealt a blow Tuesday, as U.S. health officials called for an immediate pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine over concerns about blood clots.American dropped 2.7% to $22.30 at 9:36 a.m. in New York, with much of the decline spurred by the J&J news before the start of regular trading. Other carriers and cruise lines declined as well.(Updates with projected loss in first paragraph. A previous version of this story was corrected to indicate that aircraft delivery deferrals weren’t limited to the 737 Max)"
"Economy has Nowhere Recovered, it'll take a while Before People care much about the Airline Fundamentals, other than those very old school Dead Fish.

Uncle has already given the Big Plan if they use it properly at Right time to get rid of debts by distributing stocks (at MUCH HIGHER Prices)."

"I've heard the rumors about potential management changes at AAL, but I have no idea if they're true. I'm near Toulouse tonight and I can't seem to get the wifi to work on my laptop. So the only rumors I can confirm are a possible Airbus order for 50 aircraft that some guy was trying to broker on the flight over. They weren't for AAL, and I'm guessing that WTO ruling may have ruined his week. Regarding Parker, can you get fired for a low stock price? Sure you can. But I think that's hard to do if this quarter's results are good. Is a 20% increase in earnings not good enough? Count me as skeptical, but the rumors seem hot."
"So we should get an ""investor's update"" from AAL next week, right? Is there a predictable day for it? If so, maybe I'd better clear my morning to pay attention. Thing are, um, a bit volatile these days. This is the most active passive investment I've ever made. :)"

"If you want to be a genius, start reading about Michael Levitt. He's a nobel prize winner and he's got a theory -- backed with tons of data -- that shows the coronavirus runs out of steam when 15% of the population is infected. People are rightfully surprised by what's happened the past week in the lightly hit Sunbelt where cases have spiked. But Levitt's theory says this will happen, and will end in a couple of weeks when they get to 15%. That's certainly what happened in Europe, and in the USA Northeast and upper Midwest. Hospitalizations are still declining steadily in these Northern states, giving more support to Levitt's theory. I know most investors aren't so data driven, but this is something that can make you a huge amount of money here. Airline stocks will soar as soon as the public figures out this spike is done, and the future looks largely virus-free. Personally, given the general ignorance on the topic, I'm sitting back and waiting a couple of days for more data to confirm that Levitt is correct."

"Jonathan, I agree. Pricing power will be the real driver. Many airlines hadn't taken oil seriously this year, and many were satisfied to just watch it. This last bump up in oil will start to get their attention, so we'll see if it is different this time (Of course they bumped fares up when oil went up after the 08/09 debacle, so they can do it again.) The focus shouldn't be the luck of oil prices. The industry needs to show they have control of things. It would do wonders for their stocks. But until then …Parker said back in January that it may take 9 months to a year for the industry to respond to higher oil. We'll see."

This is what the Boeing CEO is referring to.I currently don't have a position in AAL, but I hope you all continue to run up the price so I can buy lots of puts at great prices right before Q2 earnings release."
The key is guidance and cash flow going forward. Their guidance will determine the direction of the stock. December was strong cash flow should be good.

"AAL's biggest problem now is obviously momentum. Humans are bad at things like ""valuation."" They know what's working and what's not, and behave accordingly. Look at oil. Why is it going up? Almost solely because it IS going up. Same reason AAL is going down.This will flip. Probably spectacularly. But guessing the timing is, unfortunately, a guess. I think oil will stop going up before AAL goes up, but that's only a guess, too. Fundamentals are MUCH easier to predict than emotions."

"American’s liquidity isn’t nearly as strong as its peers. Before the new capital raise, its liquidity amounted to $9.9 billion, or 22% of 2019 revenue, according to Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth. Delta Air Lines (DAL) has $19 billion in liquidity, or 41% of 2019 revenues, she estimates. United Airlines Holdings (UAL) is at 40% with $17.1 billion, and it’s likely to be enhanced by $5 billion this week as it issues more debt, using its mileage program as collateral in a deal with Goldman Sachs and other banks.Debt is rising throughout the industry, and American’s debt is a growing burden, expected to hit $38.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, putting its net debt to capital ratio at a steep 109%, according to Syth. American still has financial levers to pull: It has $7 billion in “unencumbered” assets such as planes that it can collateralize, and its loyalty program could be worth $19.5 billion to $31.5 billion, she estimates. That would be at least three times its market cap of $6.3 billion."
"From the webcast earlier this week AAL said that they have revenue and cost initiatives that will amount to $2.5 billion by 2020(not including the $1.35 billion this year). If AAL just does that, I believe, the numbers yield at least $5 billion pre-tax income in 2020. UAL is doing initiatives too, but I don't think other airlines have anything like that on their table. The others do face higher fuel costs and labor cost. There should be an incentive to increase fares. (April was without Easter this year and LUV is scrambling to get passengers back after their mishaps. But soon the industry needs to get going. I believe the fare increases will be in addition to the $5+ billion pre-tax for AAL."

"Here is what I got from the call and earnings results. The business is fine. Some things may be less than optimal, like latam revenues, but what's clear is this stock deserves more than a 5 multiple. Expect buybacks to ramp up, and ramp up more and more the longer fuel remains this low."
Any suggestions for couple days? Does it goes to 46 or again 43?

"On a cheery note, Parker's speaking didn't crash the stock by 10% this quarter; perhaps the ""Parker effect"" doesn't kick in when the stock price falls below $33."
"When oil spiked last year, AAL's profits plummeted under Parker's watch and never recovered. The market knows that and is rewarding AAL with a well-earned zero vote of confidence, its stock price down 5% by noon.

Any idea why all the airlines stocks is downgrading today?
"Slashing costs does squat for deep in debt companies like AAL. Reducing service means reducing revenues and that means it becomes harder and harder for them to service their debt. Even parking planes have a cost, storage fees, lease payments and depreciation, and should they ever pull those planes out of the mothballs there's restoration and servicing costs. Something they can ill afford these days. Even at 50% capacity AAL is headed straight into chapter 11. If you don't believe me just ask HTZ shareholders what life is like when your revenues drop but you still have to keep paying on your rental fleet."
"Remember the recent annoying downgrade my Morgan Stanley with a price target of $26? On that same day they downgraded AMBA and exaggerated a pullback already taking place. Yesterday AMBA was $38 and today after-hours it is $46. Just sharing this to show how bad MS can be with their predictions. Given how rapidly both stocks fell after the downgrades, I'm suspicious MS may have had some wealthy shorts already lined up when they shared their negative opinion. Hopefully AAL experiences a big move higher soon."

"Ok so it looks like we aren't tanking the close so that's good. Technically speaking we've moved up significantly from the lows and there is a lot of incentive for short term profit taking,especially with two gaps, $27 - $30.5 - $33. Likely important to fill part of or all of the first gap back to $30.50 or build a new upwards trendline from there implying another low just above/around $31."
"The one challenge Parker and company have not addressed is how they will begin paying off their incredible debt. If analysts are concerned with your profit margins then it is only a matter of time before we see a headline on how the AAL debt will be a noose around their necks for some time to come. Also, the airlines haven't learned and they continue to invade each other's prime routes which is good for consumers but bad for profits. If Parker doesn't explain American's opportunities for moving pps back into the mid forties then who will? We may soon need to enlist Uncle and Mongo to be spokespersons for AAL!"

This stock is extreemly undervalued. AA is packing there airplanes everyday.
"In my post 14 days ago, I said ""Probably, not next week, if it happens, it's great, but I expect the stock price bounce following next week due to the low options figures while the short interest is noticeably very high.""Also, TimT 7 days ago$AAL conversation""It's Friday, the expiration date for options so looking at the overall market, the stock price maybe lower but it is short lived. If the share price doesn't pick up even if it a little later in the day, the stock price should and will move upward next week. The events that may prevent it is the occurrences of any major incidents before inauguration, market crush, and more importantly increase in options for the following week of inauguration. It is more important because I think the risks for the first two possibilities appear to be lower at the moment.""The stock price started moving up on Thursday, Jan 14th, reached $16.60, and then this week, it exceeded $16 on four consecutive days after losing momentum each day and closed at $15.56 yesterday. The stock price closed above $16 only once in the last five trading days as well. We did not have any incident over the weekend or on the day of inauguration. As I said earlier any significant increase in option contracts would cause the stock price to lose impetus. Unfortunately, the disappointing earnings and guidance report of UAL was rubbing salt on AAL's share price, too. Based on my prediction I bought more AAL stocks on margin two weeks ago at a net cost of $15.20, and I liquidated 40% of it on Friday for an average price of $16.40 ($16.20 and $16.60 on two transactions). The share price retreated before I could sell the rest. As I observed the increase in options call contracts, I attempted to sell the remaining at $16.40 on the inauguration day but the stock price reached $16.39. Yesterday, I was willing to sell them at $16.20. However, I was up all night the previous night. I overslept and I arrived my work desk 30 minutes late. As a result, I missed another opportunity yesterday. I do want to sell those shares I bought on margin in the coming days as my pessimistic outlook is making me nervous prior to earnings. It's not I am so much worried about earnings, AAL may even have better results than UAL. I just think that the rising call options in the last couple of days may not allow the share price to reach mid $16s again prior to earnings and I may walk into earnings conference with a long position on margin. I'd rather use 5%-6% gain for hedging against my long position."

"Nothing makes logical sense in this market. At least the rig count didn't do anything funky (can you imagine if we had a meaningless one week drop?). I still think that rig count is going to go into double digits soon, unless there's something (manpower, equipment) that makes it impossible. You can smell the money in oil at the moment."
"The lay-off is good for stocks, they should lay-off more people. No one at Wall Street cares about the working class. The more people they lose, the harder the government will have to pump the stock market. The working class lose money, but the rich will not lose money along with the rest, they have to make more money, by having the Fed printing cash while incurring massive national debt. And since 84% of the stocks are held by just 10% of the richest people. they are literally supported by a money printing machine. Working class cannot buy more stocks when market tanked because they got laid off and have to conserve money and may even have to sell stock to survive, while the rich with millions lying around can buy at the bottom then have the FED pump it up. This statement might sound mean spirited, but every sentence is true. If you made money, congrats, if not, criticize the government and Wall Street not me. At this point, I am surprised that we haven’t seen a revolution. $AAL, $UAL, $DAL."

AAL at a minimum you need to cut 30-50% of your workers. The only logical reason to not already dye it is to tell the govt if they don’t want to provide a good bailout this will be the consequence. 50 billion in loans is not let me repeat good enough. I think it’s time for all the major airline CEOs to come out and tell trump if they do not provide an acceptable bailout there will be severe consequences

Last call for AAL
"I’m a recent long in AAL. Wow just watched Doug Parker give an interview to Phil Lebeau on CNBC. Although Phil as he normally does sets up his interviews for a fair opportunity for a company to communicate to the public, Doug Parker was quite an unpolished speaker, stumbling on words, hesitating and not exhibiting the confidence you’d think the CEO of the US largest airline should possess. How can the AAL Board be satisfied with that performance. Parker it seams fits the persona of AAL was voted the worst airline in 2019. My thesis for buying AAL was it was a turnaround play given its recent fall with a lot of bad news built in. I’m rethinking my thesis seeing who is at the helm. Just my thoughts."
Something wrong happened.... There must be a mistake....we see the share higher...i need to visit my optician very soon....LOL

"Good luck investing on the fundamentals these days. AAL now only gives us actual financial information on a handful of days every year. You might think such information would ""matter."" Nope. Even when the company releases financial information, Wall Street can't even decide whether it's good or bad!"
Hedge funds will dump AAL on Monday and then pay Mfools to publish an article saying why the stock dropped. Hedge funds will then buy back at cheaper and the price will rise. Typical...

Look at the big picture LONG TERM—past the short term hiccups—Parker promised 3-5-7 on pretax profits. Have not come close near term, long term.It’s a story of failure. This guy also said there’s a TON of speculation Parker will be gone...probably soon."
"Any airline CEO that didn't hedge their jet fuel cost at these low prices should be dropped out of one of their planes at 30,000 feet."
Lol at people thinking it's only up from here
"During the conference call, Doug Parker said he viewed higher oil prices as a short term problem, not a long term problem. Is there anyone who knows anything about the airline industry who would disagree with that assessment? It's pretty much a Captain Obvious assertion. Yet, how many billions in market cap has AAL lost from this pretty modest hit to short term earnings. It's freakin' astonishing. Does no one understand, or care? Fundamentals sure look over-rated."
"I'm writing this from 35,000 feet (yes, on an AA flight that doesn't have an empty seat), so I haven't had a chance to actually listen to Bastian's remarks myself. But I've read the summaries, so I'm pretty much certain I know what he said. He sees no problems with demand. He thinks DAL will save $300 million on fuel next year. DAL plans 3% growth, and it seems all that will be in ""premium seats"" as that's where DAL thinks the money is. Do I have any of this wrong?If not, what seems to have accounted for another bizarro drop in airline industry shares is the idea that DAL forecasts that it will ""only"" make $6.50 next year -- a healthy profit gain of almost 20% yoy -- instead of the consensus forecast of 6.70. I believe Uncle said they get to this number by being a little conservative about fuel prices, Correct?In the real world, none of this is remotely bad. In Financial Bizarro World, it means the value of the American Airlines corporation is worth 5% less.I obviously don't know how much longer this stupid game can go on. I honestly don't think you could invest an investment situation stranger than the one we're in -- and I've seen A LOT of strange investment situations in this sector in the last 30 years. The reality of AAL's current situation is that it has precious few actual ""business risks."" I specialize in identifying airline business risks because, historically, this is a pretty bad business. But thanks to folks like Bethune and Anderson and Kelleher and Parker and Kirby, it's not a bad business anymore. They've got the business model down, and they've removed the hyper competition that made it a bad business.Now most of the risk is clearly from Wall Street -- which I find crazy given how complex this business is. But it's true. We have the REAL Wall St. risk which is financialized oil, which makes fuel costs jump around on little fundamental change and making predicting oil prices impossible. At the end of the day, however, fuel cost isn't much risk these days because there's tons of oil and the prices inevitably settle down. Indeed, Wall Street would be very wise to value airlines ""ex-fuel"" -- assume that some years will be more profitable than others based on fuel costs and not care very much about it. But, instead, they take these yo-yo fuel prices and assume every year is teetering on disaster because of changing fuel costs -- even if those fuel costs are going down! This is the FAKE Wall St risk. It includes comments from Charlatan analyst who don't have a good grasp of how this industry works. Like was there anything Bastian said today that confirms Keay's unbridled growth theory? Of course not. This nonsense will obviously end sometime, because when you keep making billions every year, and you've got a single digit p/e, something good will happen. But, because this behavior is so irrational, you'll have to get lucky if you want to make money on the referral. It;s gotten to be like oil prices. There are no facts, no data and no psychology that will tell you when the current situation will change. Just hope the business stays decent long enough for the fundamentals to eventually matter."

Still acting like you are shocked? Get over it Higher taxes will not cause the end of the world just the balance of your bank account.
Well we didnt get a stimulus that saves airline jobs. So aal will anounce worse than expected losses because Pelosi was on TV telling airlines to stop laying people off and stimulus was on the way. So they paid out more wages they they ment to. Then the shorts will move in because the stock is stuck in really low gear.

 The 6 Best EV Charging Stocks To Buy Right Now!  For details https://youtu.be/9k5wH5A48PM
"""Industry revenues have fallen an estimated 95% year-over-year in April. And while no one has a perfect crystal ball, I think we all expect that recovery will be slow and demand for air travel will be suppressed for quite some time. So in this environment, there are 3 critical issues that any airline must manage: First, ensuring the safety and comfort of the team members and customers; second, maintaining ample liquidity to ride through a sustained crisis; and third, planning for an uncertain future. First, as it relates to safety, we dramatically increased the frequency and intensity of our aircraft cleaning. We're limiting seat sales on every flight, including not allowing half of the main cabin middle seats to be assigned. We've reduced food and beverage service on planes to limit contact with others. As of May 1, we will begin the gradual ramp-up of providing customers with PPE kits, which include masks and sanitizing wipes as well as requiring our flight attendants to wear mask in-flight. Turning to liquidity. These efforts for all airlines come in 2 sets of initiatives: raising cash and conserving cash. On the first, American's absolute liquidity position is very strong. We ended the first quarter with $6.8 billion in liquidity, and American's share of the CARES Act proceeds is $10.6 billion, which results in $17.4 billion when you combine our quarter-end liquidity and CARES Act access. And importantly, outside of our recently arranged $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan, we do not have any meaningful non-aircraft debt amortization payments for more than 2 years. So we feel confident with that level of liquidity, but in this uncertain environment, we'll continue looking for additional sources. We have more than $10 billion of unencumbered assets at our disposal. And that excludes the value of our AAdvantage program. Our plan is to first work with the Treasury Department to secure our CARES Act loan of $4.75 billion at attractive rates and then explore other initiatives as needed from there. As to conserving cash, Derek will describe our initiatives in more detail. We've enacted a comprehensive cash conservation plan to eliminate all unnecessary operating and capital expenditures. We expect this will reduce our daily cash burn rate from an expected average of $70 million per day in the second quarter to approximately $50 million a day for the month of June. As a result of all that, we expect to end this quarter with approximately $11 billion of liquidity and a significant amount of unencumbered assets still in place. And that forecast assumes little to no increase in demand for air travel throughout the quarter. Third, and perhaps the most difficult thing for airlines to do at this time, is to properly plan for the future. We're using this opportunity to make our airline stronger in a number of ways, and we expect to emerge a more efficient and more streamlined airline. And to do that most efficiently, we need to begin making decisions soon about how large an airline we want to run in the summer of 2021 and beyond. As you all know, things like aircraft availability, pilot training and maintenance programs do not have short planning horizons. That's always been an issue in our business. But today, those capacity plans are severely complicated by the extreme uncertainty regarding the anticipated level of demand for air travel, not just for the next few months, but for the next few years. So we at American decided to err on the side of being smaller than we might like rather than larger. As Derek will describe, and as our first quarter financials indicate, we made the decision to retire our entire 757, 767 and A330-300 and Embraer 190 fleet as well as certain regional aircraft. These decisions alone will reduce our 2021 fleet count by approximately 100 aircraft versus our prior plans, and we'll continue to assess further reductions as we move forward. So in conclusion for me, these are unprecedented times for our world, our country and our industry. The uncertainty about the future weighs on everyone and for a good reason. There's no way to overstate the gravity of the situation for the airline industry and difficult decisions lie ahead for all of us."""
"So glad I have dry powder for these planned attack days. There is no obvious reason for the drop, so it seems coordinated."
My friends traveled from Chicago to Phoenix on a packed American Airlines flight
"I know it's hard to understand, but keep watching the virus data. USA data today was significantly better than expected. Drop in deaths and hospitalizations in NYC, and no real sign of virus expansion elsewhere in the USA. Everyone from the President to the Media to the Public is geared up for the apocalypse, but it hasn't come yet (except, perhaps, to NYC). Washington State shows that the apocalypse might not happen.I'm starting to model how a recovery could happen. It could be slow to start. People will be scared, cautious and isolationist. You've probably heard about all the vacation communities who didn't want the city folks to hunker down in their vacation homes. That's human nature. I suspect there are going to be a lot of folks who don't want visitors for the next few months, including airline visitors. They'll impose quarantines and such. It's gonna be fun."
"As I leave for the wilderness for a couple days, ponder the following. Despite scary headlines, it seems extremely likely to me that this virus panic will end this month. It will end one of either two ways. First, a drop off in cases, perhaps aided by containment efforts, as we are now dramatically seeing in China. Warm weather will almost certainly help -- just look where the cases are right now. Or Option B: ""everyone"" gets the virus, and figures out it isn't a big deal for almost everyone. The only thing I really worry about here is what happened in Lombardy, Italy. The virus was getting licked, and then suddenly Lombardy became mini-Wuhan. I haven't seen a good explanation why."
"4 new deaths reported and stocks took it in stride. So, consistent deaths appear to be priced in. I am not sure what ""rate of acceleration"" of deaths is priced in."
AAL well be get back to 20s $by EOW sell while you can as the highest in 2019 before the pandemic was 36 $ fundamentally it will fluctuate between20$ & 27$ till the 3rd Q
"It's painfully obvious to me that the folks who think UAL will continue to outperform its peers will be greatly disappointed. And I say that as a UAL shareholder! There just ins't enough difference in the business models of the Big 3 for this to happen over any length of time. Yes, financial out-performance can happen for a year or so, and some management teams will be better, but they're all going to revert to the mean. History shows exactly this.The biggest driver in out-performance tends to be the relative strength of the route networks at any given time. If one international region is doing significantly better than others, the airline which has the best network in that region will outperform its peers. This is pretty much just math.AAL has been hampered a bit lately because its network advantage is Latin America and that has been a significant under-performer. Brazil and Argentina, and some Mexican markets, have been poor. This hasn't dramatically changed lately, but there are some signs of hope. UAL just said in their conference call that Latin America will go from declining unit revenue to positive 3 to 5% RASM in Q4. Watch next week for AAL's report on Latin revenue, too."
Told you not to leave months ago
"I'm hoping AAL's management is more conversant on COVID science than the posters on this board who know nothing but think they're smarter than people like Nobel laureate Michael Levitt. In some respects, though, management doesn't need to be that smart: as the deaths and hospitalizations dramatically go down in the next few weeks, they will see the next traffic uptick. The biggest question is whether there is enough summer left to get to one million enplanements. I would guess ""yes,"" but we'll see.I'll be returning to the skies this week and won't be able to post much, but I know exactly what's going to happen with the virus. We will see a few more days of high-ish death counts and then they will start to decline. It's hard to know how fast because the States are really bad at posting ""real time"" death: a lot of the deaths posted are weeks ago. Hospitalizations are easier to predict: they will be down sharply this week. AZ is a few days ahead of the rest and they're down 20% in 10 days. That will happen across the Sunbelt as it has already started. USA COVID hospitalizations should drop by about half in a month. Daily deaths should be under 300, and that's with the generous ""with COVID"" standard the USA uses. In a month there will be plenty of leisure travellers, but we will worry whether business travellers will return. I think they will, but probably not so much until October. A vaccine would be abolutely great for economic reasons -- it will crush the fear -- but medically unnecessary. Without a vaccine, COVID will become just another flu, but we'll want to be careful next year as a fair number of seasonal cases MIGHT pop up, especially in parts of the country that haven't yet been hit hard by the virus (no herd immunity)."

Fun to watch.... shorts keep trying to drop the stock and each time they are immediately gobbled up with new buyers. You think flights can get WORSE? You think the vaccines don't work?

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday that major passenger airlines have agreed in principle to a $25 billion payroll support package meant to help airlines weather the economic impact of the coronavirus on travel demand.The six largest U.S. airlines - American Airlines Group Inc , United Airlines Holdings Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co , JetBlue Airways Corp and Alaska Airlines - as well as a number of other airlines accepted, it said.""We look forward to working with the airlines to finalize the necessary agreements and disburse funds as quickly as possible,"" Treasury said in a statement.Under the terms laid out by Treasury officials last week, the government would receive repayment on 30% of the funds awarded to large carriers and warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount.Based on wages and benefits paid in the second and third quarters of 2019, American and United were each eligible for about $6 billion, Delta about $5.6 billion, Southwest about $4 billion, and JetBlue and Alaska roughly $1.2 billion each.U.S. passenger airlines can also apply for a separate $25 billion loan scheme under the government's $2.3 trillion stimulus package, known as the CARES Act, and had lobbied for the payroll relief portion to be free cash.The statute gave Treasury the authority to demand compensation for the grants, but did not require it. According to the terms, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining agreements.When the law was approved last month, major airlines said the money would protect jobs through September but warned that the continued challenges facing the industry would require more action, including some tough decisions in the months ahead if demand is slow to recover.Estimated global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, 25% more than previously forecast, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday, owing to the severity of the economic downturn and a slower than previously expected reopening of international routes.Alexandre de Juniac, the Geneva-based organization's CEO, said leaving the middle seat vacant was among likely conditions for a resumption of air travel to be discussed with governments in a series of coordinated meetings around the world.(Reporting by Tracy Rucinski in Chicago and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

"23$ is target price for Deutsche Bank. 23$ will be passed soon. Question is which triggers do we need for 30$. BMHO 1,5mio TSA and 50% vaccinated citizens."
buyback is happening?
on the 1 year chart if rsi breaks 50 this will fly. AAL has not broken 50 on the rsi since the down turn. All other charts are also turning bullish.
"Expect this to bounce higher next week. This is the news from UK.UK GOVERNMENT TO BUY EQUITY STAKES IN AIRLINES INCLUDING BRITISH AIRWAYS TO PREVENT COLLAPSE AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, FINANCIAL TIMES SOURCES"
"Vasu Raja - American Airlines Chief Revenue Officer, joined Yahoo Finance to discuss the outlook for the airline industry amid covid-19. He made some very strong statements about fast recovery and passenger growth."
"Ground Zero:on 8/29/16 Scott Kirby Joined UAL, The closing price on 8/28/16:UAL $46.95, LUV $36.01, AAL was $35.70, DAL $35.43All of them are Up in comparison, all of them have spent tons of money buying back their stocks, and AAL, DAL and LUV even paid dividend and UAL NOT.What have they done differently in the last 2 years???"
Anyone saying this is going to $20+ this week or next and anyone saying this is going to single digits are both wrong. Buy and hold for 6-12 months and don’t worry about small fluctuations. If you’re in it for short term then you’re just gambling.
"AAL and oil seems to be paired on the algos again. What is it -- a risky assets play?Personally, I'm shocked oil can rise with those mind-boggling gasoline and diesel builds. Remember, January 1 is tax day for this stuff. You're supposed to draw down inventories. Instead, we see the largest product builds I can ever recall. I know Wall Street isn't too focused on reality these days, but c'mon. You'd have to be a fool to be bullish with those numbers."
AAL: « fake it till we make it »
"Facts matter. Fundamentals matter. Technicals matter. Truth matters. Chuckling about maniac pumpers on this board and in brokerages, as well as misguiding politicos. Price of AAL began tending down April 13, 2021. Trending down, left to right on chart. At $22 and change FTM EPS negative earnings -$4,72, FTM negative earnings yield -22.2%, FTM negative P/E -4.51. Not ready for my money. Bulls keep buying negatives, Bears keep selling negatives. One source supports downside to $18 and change. Even that too expensive for this fool. Yes, I missed the boat at $10 and change. Is that my ship coming into view? Listening to JJ Cale's music performance ""In Appreciation"". ""They call me ""The Breeze"" cuz I keep movin' down the road."""
"Listening to sports talk radio earlier today. They announced a 5min test for covid that cost 5 dollars is now coming to market. Will have 50 million test kits available by Oct. Have not verified but, if true airline travel just became a real again."
