Recent headlines and conversations for TWTR
"While I do not agree people will be deleting Twitter, I have seen the number of pickups on phones have dropped by over 90% a day since I stopped checking all day what Trump was tweeting about. If even a small percentage of the user base is also checking this much less, I can only presume forecasted projections will be dismal this next earnings call."
"Last time Joseph mentioned his 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus monkey, the market dropped close to 200 points."
Love another Twitter down day.

"How do people not see the way the media covered the inauguration? The media talked about the people their like they were royalty! While over 40,000 armed guards and 12’ high fences kept the average American out. If you can’t see it god bless you. This is a horrible terrible time in U.S. history that’s about to go down."
Full circle is coming for some of the largest businesses in our country imo. Many businesses like Twitter have become social justice warriors shifting away from corporate values that focus on social welfare and environment. This is a big mistake. Politics don't sell. The consumer always has the last word.
Dorsey thinks the North Korean model is what's best.

"The shorts will kill Twitter. Going to happen. Twitter, Facebook and Google have forgotten that most of the nations money is in the hands of Republicans and legal voters who are actually alive and work for a living."

"Bobby has posted 170 comments the last two weeks, before that he was banned by Yahoo. Welcome back Billy! LMAO Being banned a 5th TIME! LMAO"

#DEACTIVATETWITTER
$AAPL $TWTR $AMZN $FB. Look at the charts today. All artificially being pumped up. You’re going to get a few good days but it’s a slow and steady ride to the bottom. People are leaving their products and services because censorship isn’t good for anyone. Regardless of party.
We now have a 78 year old Alzheimer’s patient as President and giggly school girl as VP!
Staying away from fb and putting my money on twitter. twitter has a lot of room for growth and it's just about to create revenues outside of ads. this will be an interesting year.
This was upgraded. CNBC said to buy. Why is it going down?
Rush said he deactivated his Twitter account. He has 88.6 million followers. Good for him.
- Already unprofitable company - Just expelled its biggest asset - Just alienated half of the U.S.Might be a good time to sell.
Twitter bans freedom of speech!Repub or democrat... doesnt matter your nextEveryone must cancel twitter today!!!!!
Twitter is Toast. Younger millennials don't use it. All the Trumpers have left to other app's. Attracting new users is going to be very difficult for them.

TWTR has $41 BILLION in mkt cap with just $3.6 billion in revenue. Earnings are negligible. The $52 stock price has a long way to fall. Karma.

"sell your twtr shares, make the world a better place"
Social media argues that they should not be held legally responsible for content as they are just a platform and cannot control it. Apparently they can. There goes that arguement.

"I recommend selling this stock short. Since they do not believe in freedom of speech for conservatives,they are doomed to go out of business."
TWTR is leading the way to a new Realization of the TRUTH based on FACTS!

G'mornin' Jack!
"SP has fallen nearly 15% since Jan 6th. Investors take note of the high forward P/E, high price/sale, high price/book and low book value. No dividends. What is it that appeals to those who are investing their hard earned money in this company? The stock price will continue to decrease."

Yep silence sure is violence. It especially shows when state governors and mayors allow violence in their cities and stay hush-hush about it. The violence only gets worse￼
Short-sellers unite!
Definately strong sell
You can post video about Tiananmen Square on Twitter. You can even post the photos showing those that didn’t make it. Not sure what the problem is.
The US has 3 or 4 times as many COVID19 cases as China or India and they both have over 3 billion people while the US only has a little over 300 million. It’s a shame the previous administration didn’t take COVID19 more seriously. Remember “only 15 cases soon to be zero” or “it’s fully contained and will disappear like magic.”The US now has 25 MILLION COVID19 cases.
"The EU has just announced they will be shutting down twitter, google, facebook and censoring apple, microsoft. YEEEE HAAAAA"

"Gab site is pretty fast and growing, now if parler can do the same"
SELL SELL SELL
We must short it
"Should be in green tomorrow, huge beat on revenue"
"Twitter announced today that they acquired Revue, a tiny private company located in the Netherlands that has 6 employees, that's right- 6 employees. It is reasonable to assume that this start-up firm is bleeding red ink and welcomed a buyer before it was forced to declare bankruptcy (remember, the majority of small businesses fail). If Revue is the reason Twitter is up today, it is a ludicrous reaction, and a temporary upward moment as Twitter's negative fundamentals have not changed."
This company is like those oily dotcom bust companies from the Y2K era. Smoke and mirrors and nothing behind them. I don't trust a thing Jack and his smoke and mirror guys say. Nothing.
"Years too recover... maybe never. VZ might would buy it, they bought Yahoo for some pocket change!"
"It's Wednesday, January 13, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his brownshirt twatteratti be censoring today?"
Time to quit Twitter! Everyone!!!We need to save free speech and send a message to corporate tech they cannot lie and control us at their discretion.
Hope this stock crashes!!!!!
Looks like a stock that is ready to dip
How did my order at $40 not get filled?!?! Sooo disappointed.
Huge Lawsuits coming so long Twitter Facebook and eventually Google!!! Cannot wait! get the popcorn out!
"Politics aside, this company still isn’t profitable and it’s usership has already peaked. What a scam. They had over a $1B loss this year in net earnings in what has been a record year for social media useage due to the pandemic and it still has almost a $40B valuation. OUCH. (You all should buy this stock, maybe it will only lose $950M next year)."
"Now that the Dennison Empire is experiencing a severe drop in revenue, I would encourage the Faithful, the ""Special"" people and the ""Loved"" people to send generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago. This one is legit, not to be confused with either the Foundation or the University.Income at Mar-a-Lago has dropped significantly. Thankfully the agreement that Mar-a-Lago would not be used as a residence will be ignored and Mar-a-Lago (the ""Club"", not the residence) will be able to continue to bill the US taxpayer for food, lodgings and golf cart rentals to the Secret Service.I would also urge you to send all your legal work to Mr. Giuliani to support him in these difficult times and to buy MAGA-branded My Pillows to support the downtrodden among us. That it all. Continue on Bigly.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Account Got Axed?"
"""CRASH TWITTER! This is a shot that will be heard around the world..."" PLEASE RETWEET THIS! lol"

"Where is Hunter, Jack ???"

Twitter is the most damaging company to the humans in history. It’s basically controlled speech. It’s basically china.
"I've watched Shorts take down oil companies. This fly on the wall company, is an easy take down. Shorts have it..."
earnings per share negative 1.58 how does a company survive like this. and now they #$%$ off millions of users.........
"Too bad, @Jack cannot censor Yahoo! Finance TWTR MB... He is getting eaten alive, here! And he deserves every bit of it, too. I suppose he'll be lucky if he doesn't spend considerable time in the slammer, but that's just my opinion. How can a man get away with breaking the First Amendment of the Constitution like Moses slammed down the Ten Commandments? At least Moses was responding to his people falling into idolatry. @Jack is trying to run the world by censorship and manipulation of the public narrative. ILLEGAL..."

"I was tortured for this pick by an investment group for years. But we picked it up in high teens and low 20s. I said, “expect a long long slow March to 70 for technical reasons, and then look out above, as this is the only internet property with staying power because of celebrity, corporate, and government adoption.” I expect a few apologies in my email tonight. Even I had lost faith and sold a small portion when covered calls expired in the money as few months ago. Still have a disabled position though."
This company is not well. Very weak.
thousands of guards (Trmp spprtrs) will be protecting trmp supprtrs on wed...lol...they keep deleting this point...trying to silence the truth
Conservatives MUST cancel libbys....MUST...who gives a da%$ what these libbys think or have to say.....

I think the ISP’s should block Twitter and Facebook for going against their policies.
"Looks like it’s gonna be a great week to short this into oblivion..,"

"January 25, 2021 05:35 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsTwitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) launched Birdwatch, a new initiative to flag misleading tweets.What Happened: Birdwatch is a pilot program that allows users to identify information in tweets they believe is misleading and write notes providing informative context, the company said in a blog post. The social media platform will eventually make these notes more visible on tweets for its global audience.While it remains in a testing phase, the notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site.""We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,"" Twitter said.Related Link: Tesla Seeks A 'Specialist' To Address 'Social Media Escalations' Aimed At CEO Elon MuskWhy It's Important: Twitter's initiative follows interviews with more than 100 individuals ""across the political spectrum,"" the company said. There was ""broad general support"" for Birdwatch that helps evaluate the trustworthiness of a tweet.""We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying,"" Twitter said.What's Next: Twitter will focus on how to prevent manipulative practices in its initiative and ensure it isn't dominated by a simple majority."
"I have been holding TWTR since 2015. Whew, patience finally pays off. Compared to SNAP, TWTR is only a bit more than 50% of SNAP market cap. I am sure Twitter has lots of room to go from here if the comparison with Snapchat is justified: Twitter has 330m subscribers, vs Snap 250m. Additionally, TWTR has tangible earnings, vs Snapchat is still losing money.Go TWTR"
"Every time I post a comment about how the Democrats will ruin the economy, stock market, and country it will get deleted, if people on here who are censoring these comments disagree with that and think things will be just fine 2, 3, or 4 years from now why would they sensor a #$%$ statement then......I will tell you, because they know it is true and that many people who voted against Trump will look back 3 or 4 years from now and wish they had voted for him and just kept silent about it!"
Jack Dorsey gave $10 million to a race indoctrinator for the sole purpose of poisoning the minds of young children. This is one of the many faces of your enemy and mine.
"This will trade below $40 by end of week, $30 or less by March, $20 or less by June."
I can't criticize Kamala without being deleted. Why is she more entitled to free speech than me. I spent 6 years in the Military to protect all Americans rights. Let's see if this gets deleted.

Gasoline just blew thru $3.00 a gallon on it's way to $4.00..The next recession will be caused by a senile old man in the White House....
Most shareholders are base in the US and most doesn’t agree with this type of suppression. Twitter will regret this.
TWTR is in good hands of shorts .
Can you imagine Q1 earnings after millions delete Twitter and Facebook accounts? Poor decisions have consequences
"“The mob was fed lies,” McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”"
twtr is falling off the cliff due to retaliation from withdrawing President Trump account...caused millions of subscribers withdraw their account with twtr as well ...too bad to hold for long term investment...most likely gonna be very bad commimg quarter e/r....
Jack telling the investors everything will be fine....
Definite Pump and Dump going on. MKM Partners? I'm a fund manager and that's the first I've ever heard of them. Short this. The Financial Media are manipulating the gullible same as always. Meanwhile world leaders in other countries are condemning Twitter and Facebook.
I’m proud to say I sent 22 eviction notices last week. Only to my liberal tenants. Cancel culture can be fun for conservatives too!
Hey Jack...
Can’t stop a stock that wants to go down
Twitter downhill from here

Delete your Twitter and Facebook accounts immediately. Only way to send a message to big tech.
Twitter is in the toilet. It’s throwing away money to buy this stock.
"Bleeding won't stop until we get some new numbers concerning account losses. Check out sensor tower and see the lower engagement, google trends also shows a spike and now a drop in interest."
Stock is going too high...lol
Very pricy even at $34
"Would not hold into 2/9 earnings report, going to be a bloodbath of red"
How many people are going to quit Twitter now? Who even cares about Twitter? It could disappear and the world would be better off.
Selling all twitter stock Monday. I won't support suppression of free speech.
"DATA HARVESTING, that's what Twitter and Facebook is really about. They have been caught selling your personal information to third-parties, they even sell it to dodgy bad actors outside the USA. This is fundamentally why there are so many data breeches, people have your information, and will use it to defraud you."
Changes in followers. @MikePence: -80k @Jim_Jordan: -160k @DailyCaller: -90k || @JoeBiden: + 1 million @KamalaHarris: +600k @AOC: +300k. Safe to say that many of those are new. I don't think $TWTR is losing a lot of users.
"Remove it from the s&p, belongs on Shanghai index."
my entire family deleted twitter just now... i think millions will do the same... dead stock

"some big money holding this up, but why? no future for a losing company"
I bought puts options but Twitter keeps going up
"One thing is obvious from Dorsey's response yesterday. America has changed as we know it. Liberals running wild, freedom of speech is being lost, hypocrites all over the place. Elite becoming more elite, the every day common man (opps person) is being lost in this country. Big tech getting more powerful, we are on our way to a socialist or Communist country. China, Russia, Iran all laughing in our face. We are DOG poop.Remember though--- what causes uprisings and grass roots movements??? These events do. People do not like being silenced, they want their voices heard. Remember 2022 is coming. Send a message. It all tarts with the House. Get some common sense and real Americans in the House. Put Nancy out to pasture. Fore the SQUAD. Its all up to you. Take your country back. Peacefully. And why not???"
"Wow, opening 9% higher!"
"Would be banned by more countries and the number of users is dropping rapidly, why risk your hard-earned money on TWTR?? SELL and GO ARKK, ARKQ, ARKG, ARKW!"
We haven't heard from Debra today. I like to hear from Debra and then watch the stock collapse.
New America = Censorship! Liberals should be so proud.
Its impossible to ignore politics when TWTR is a totally political company. People used it thinking it was a neutral patform. Now everyone to the right of Karl Marx knows its not and they can only stay if they ditch every shred of dignity they have and accept whatever weird things demanded of them. The movement away from Twitter is real. This company is finished.
"koo koo koo, that sounds as end of twitter in india and the same will be replicated in different countries. Twitter has very less significance in cross border."
I don't really see the intransic value of investing in twitter bird .
It's no accident the CEO looks a like Carl Marx. One thing in the U.S.A is we as American's can invoke Capital Markets punishment on the Stock by Selling TWTR to Bankruptcy which indeed will occur over the Next 6 months when it's only major client and voice of the last four years leaves. It was going to happen anyway their was no way that Trump Organization would not be setting up it's own media networks day's after the President left office anyway. The CEO of TWTR knew that and so did we. The U.S. Capital Markets will invoke justice on TWTR. Then they will get it!
"guys follow me on parler @DropShock and leave a comment so I can follow you back, we need to support each other and build parler up into a competitor for these liberal tech giants. also remember to deactivate your accounts and not just delete the apps that way during the earnings call it shows as a massive drop in users to really get the point across"
"Jo Bydung has hired 14 current and former executives from the BIG 5 tech firms to advise his transition team..this should make the little hairs on your neck stand up, after what we have just witnessed..Sell Baby!!"
Twtr lost a cool 5 bil bucks of its market value just 2day.
"$AAPL $SQ $TWTR $FB $MSFT Really, Dementia/Beijing Joe is awesome! Should be in a nursing home! Not President! What a joke! Go Apple and Tim Cook. Tim like little china..../..... I thought. Then I remember China has 1.5B potential customers vs. .32B in the USA. Go Tim Cook and Dementia Joe!!!!!!!!!"

Why won’t Twitter remove hateful antifa accounts if they care so much about inciting violence?

A Twitter short is free money. Good for the soul too.
This announcement was negative today. 20% growth does not justify this valuation... not even close.

I'm calling it. Fake demand! Funds know the writing is on the wall and are dumping on this unexpected and unjustifiable strength.
"Hey, I'm no liberal but I like making money. Twitter looks good."
Never ever invest or use services of politically biased company. Anything you post on left wing social media they don't like will come back to haunt you.
The best way to make twitter pay for free speach sensorship is to sell all your shares. Let’s make this go down to zero!!!
The stock is defying gravity. Fundamentals do not indicate that there is going to be explosive bottom line growth in this stock.
Lots of supporters of Twatters here like Chuck who likes chock. I bet they are all flaming like their beloved closeted Jackie Dorset.
TWTR is a company that makes no profit and hates and censors their customers. It may not be a viable company in a year as it starts to face new competition.
Twitter is done only a matter of time..
"what do we need twitter for anyway. we are exposed to boots and propaganda and can get fired for a post someone find offensive years later. AND they mine our data and it gets leaked, sold, and/or hacked.what is the upside?"

Boyd had no thoughts on how residents should boil any water they do find without utilities."

It is amazing how many people trust Twitter with their hard earned money
TWTR is up about 35% after booting DJT off its platform for toxic posts advocating election theft. That's what you call the application of sound business principles.
Twitter is a uinque product with lots of pricing power. So is snap
"And it’s green, heard someone was saying bye bye Twitter few minutes ago. Wya ?!"
A company that specializes in censoring forms a KGB type committee to directly go after those they want to destroy......and the stock is up????

Godspeed Rush Limbaugh. Great men's love and ideas live on after them. RIP.
Why doesn't TWTR close down the accounts of AuntTeefuh thugs? They are a known domestic terrorist organization yet their accounts remain active. Obviously TWTR is run by Marxist Leninists who support a radical agenda. These people are vermin and there's only one effective way to deal with vermin.

"Any day now Tucker Carlson will find the duplicate of the evidence that he ""lost in the mail"" the same night that his dog ate his homework and Rudy Giuliani will release the evidence gleaned from his most recent Lev Parnas-sponsored Ukraine Walkabout 2.0.After coming off dozens and dozens of successful lawsuits, Rudy Giuliani is about to drop the bigly hammer on Dominion with his explosive, blockbuster evidence (which he's given to Tucker Carlson for safekeeping).In the meantime, I would urge the faithful to mail their generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago to help with its day-to-day expenses which have become ever more so untenable due to the refusal of Deutsche Bank t extend additional loan and the PGA having cancelled future tournaments.The NRA will no longer be able to make shadow donations due to their recent bankruptcy filing, but the billions that Rudy Giuliani will glean from the successful countersuit against Dominion will ensure that Mar-a-Lago is overflowing with orange Nike Soft golf balls and berders for many years to come.Bigly.

"Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter pose a direct threat to our democracy. It's time to ""cancel"" them. Is short-term inconvenience worth freedom? You lived without these companies before. You can now. Let the free market replace them."
"Subscribers going down is very bad news for an ad-driven revenue model. Their ""inventory"" of impressions generated by traffic will be down big, which means lower revenue per ad. This is just economics--as revenue per ad goes down, they need to sell more ads but they won't have the inventory--there's only so many ""eyeballs"" you can sell. Imagine Apple having to lower prices on iphones, but not having more iphones to sell--they could make more; how will Twitter generate more traffic? If tens of millions of subscribers have deactivated, how do you get more subscribers to join? This is a death spiral, folks."
Twitter needs to be owned by China or Iran oh sorry they are! Twitter is not yelcome here in the USA any more!!!!

"Any type of censorship is dangerous to Democracy. Censorship fosters a one-sided view with no dissent and that is dangerous as proven by history #$%$ Germany, Stalin Russia, Mao China).

"Still shorting :) if anything it my patriotic duty to do so. No matter how you slice or dice it they will loose users, slow growth and if boycotted they will loose a lot of advertising revenue. For a company that is not profitable now you think the action they take are worthy of your money or the stock evaluation. Just wait it doesn’t happen in one day but this will go down. Mm and hedge funds will see that it’s a risk for growth and revenue they will start to transition as well."
Feb 9th. Mark the date. This will be a mixed earnings report. Why? Because it was near the end of this quarter that Twtr decided to become Totalitarian. People will be confused. They may buy more or sell off. It won’t be until May that you will see the picture start to make sense. At that point investors will be selling.
Cathie Wood of Arc Investment increased position in Twitter. This will double by end of this year.

Find something else which works for your family and REAL friends (not strangers) use that instead. Seriously delete Twitter."

Twitter longs - you were warned repeatedly that this would gap down at some point. You have not seen the gap down yet - this is just the begginning. It will not be long before you will be wishing you could go back and sell at these levels. This literally may be a single digit stock real soon.

"Report looks pretty good. Good growth in key user metrics, decent EPS, and generating twice as much cash flow as same period last year.Expect the price will be volatile for a couple of days and then the upward trend will continue in the coming weeks.Think long, folks, don't dance to the pump-and-dump musicians.BTW: I hate this company and it's politics. And I believe the CEO is out of his depth. But that doesn't take away from the excellent market position and growth potential."

James Okeefe of Project Veritas has another Twitter video coming out tomorrow at 8am.
"$SNAP has a tremendous opportunity out in front of it. Numerous years of ~50%+ revenue growth is enough to justify an even greater valuation in my opinion. Long-term we have an easy bull-case: targeting, ad platform, optimization, and Snap Ad analytics improve, enabling eCPM (ad pricing) growth. In addition, new streamlined product (five parts of Snapchat) enable new ad inventory to be opened up. This allows a lot more impressions per user (i.e. higher ARPU). In addition, lack of content moderation costs relative to platforms like $TWTR and $FB enables higher long-term margin profile. In my view, not financial advice WHATSOEVER, this couldn't be a clearer buying opportunity."
I just Jacked off

"There is one way we can send a message to the powers that be, and that is to use the tremendous power of our money. Sure Twitter is a target for bears ( and rightfully so) but there is something else at work here other than that. If conservatives can organize and solidify around one central principle and that is”You don’t spend your wealth on items or services that are leftist leaning companies of all types.” But first you must organize your own wallet. Control your money and we’ll what they say then. More to"
TWTR going under would be a plus for the USA.
"MOST people on the right who are #$%$ off with Twitter haven't left yet as they don't want to be disconnected entire. Most people on the left will ALSO exit as they don't have Trump to hate on every day anymore. It's already boring and will only be more boring as Biden will suddenly have to actually LEAD instead of blaming every paper cut or stubbed toe on Trump. So once everything is resolved in DC the current exodus will like a slow drip compared to the tsunami who will drop twitter in 2-3 months. Not to mention those who ONCE KNEW letting everyone speak their mind, even when you vehemently disagree with them, IS an American value, they TOO will exit twitter for taking such a dictatorial heavy hand. And once they go, they will NEVER come back. Check out Fox News, NFL, NBA, if you do not believe losing your audience in THIS manner, is PERMANENT. Twitter will NEVER have MANY of these users ever again. There is also a coming Facebook exodus...it will be very strong as well. Feb-March timeframe enjoy the downward slides shorting these stocks."
"ARK bought a large position last week.... again, $100 in 12-24 months."
"Twitter has chosen to slice away a huge chunk of their customer base.But unlike currently out of favor pandemic distressed companies, TWTR will never see favor again. They've chopped off an appendage that won't grow back.Maybe this is what they want. Maybe they want to be a small player. A small player with a 100% like-minded clientele in a zero controversy echo chamber.I don't know, but for a publicly traded company, that is arguably criminal.Not sure what tomorrow brings for TWTR, but the future is dismal."
"congrats, new shorts! great time to jump into the short bandwagon."
"There is a rumour that anyone that uses social media to communicate , “ with other humans” .. Aliens and others excluded., will be required to pass a test. Said test will require answering a complex list series of socio economic queries. question #1: Are you a Democrat?Thank you for your response."
I would like a place where everyone is happy. Obviously Twitter CEO is against that.
It is just a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half.
"Where will $TWTR stock price go without regard to financials, just charts?==> Get into CHART for $TWTR. Using the 1 month chart, select +Comparison add PINS.What gap do you see? Do they start out on equal footing? Is PINS a stronger or weaker stock in your opinion than TWTR? What do you think will happen with that gap?Invest wisely. Protect your gains. All Americans should make money!"
This stock is so unpredictable the options market is long calls and puts for next week Its held support well but obviously its a $60-80 range stock so depends on your risk
"Socialism believes if that the individual is nothing, the state/government is everything. If you fail to believe like you are told, and don't accept government regulation and control over everything, you are the problem to be dealt with (job loss, persecution in all its forms, threats). Twitter is merely another instrument of coercion--coercion is evil and is not acceptable."
Boeing crashed another plane. Their stock won’t perform as bad as Twitter tomorrow.
"Politics and Finance and Dislike of Longs v Shorts Aside:Ask yourself, FY20 + Q4 earnings were out only 16 days ago including company calls, FY21 Q1 earnings (negative) estimate, etc.; now this presser today. Why not 16 days ago? What is the point? Did the entire company public trading history (8 years) change in 16 days? This is classic pump before something not-so-good."
Wow ever since Mr. Orange got banned this thing has been on a TEAR.

"You can thank the Neanderthal thinking of the dementia patients illegit administration for the current crisis going on at our Southern border. While you're stuck at home with no job, mounting bills and kids being denied a basic education, the illegit twit is welcoming thousands of Covid infected illegals into the country to take your jobs, your healthcare and your money via undeserved Covid relief funds. The resounding truth is stolen elections have consequences and radical demo communists deplore you."

If you are still using Twitter you are now at extreme risk of being targeted by cyber criminal attacks!
I set price alert at 20
Last five it should slip
"like a blue homing pigeon, heading for the gap at 59.88."
Considering what Dorsey is doing to people who do not have the same political ideology as he... Twitter should crash...which is what he deserves. Too bad others have to suffer for his evil doing.
I am hoping this company goes out of business....
OMG ... 'TrumpTV' will be Armageddon for Jackoff's little Twitter.

Jack Dorsey tweeted of selling 2.5 million shares

"$PINS valuation has a lot of room to run. Compare $PINS mkt cap (55B) to $SNAP (96B), Airbnb $ABNB (129B), $DASH (71B), or $SPOT (68B). The big 3 $FB, $TWTR, and $GOOG face political/regulatory headwinds, and $AMZN is probably going to get scrutiny too. $PINS stands to benefit."
February 9 is doomsday for Twitter. Let?s see if they can #$%$ their way out of their earnings.
GiveDirectly is only 88% efficient. So where is their financial report on where the other 14% is and how it is allocated or spent?
Jack Dorsey intentionally and willfully torpedoed his own company. But it’s not his to do that with anymore. It belongs to millions of people owning those 751 million shares.In discussing with legal experts all of us who have been impacted negatively would be wise to form the largest class action suit in history.
"From the Goldman price upgrade:""But some traders think the rally has gone too far. ""The problem is, on a technical basis, it's also getting incredibly overbought,"" Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, told CNBC on Thursday.He noted that the last time the stock's relative strength index moved this high, in mid-2018, Twitter plummeted about 40% in less than six months."""
I bet the stock is down at least 10% tomorrow.

"If you have a Masters in Business Administration you just witness Twitter voluntary “flipping porters 5 forces” and inviting a new entrance.If you do not have an MBA, twitter decided it would no longer be a monopoly and committed suicide.￼If you are a share holder, you may have a claim against leadership and the company for BAD leadership as actions take are not in the best interest of the company BUT in the interest of leaderships opinion at shareholders expense. (No matter which way you vote.)If you are Parler you may or may not have a torturous interference claim worth in excess of $25,000,000,000.

Here is a leak about the FBI... I used to work at a private satellite image processing buisiness whose software was mostly used by natural resource and intelligence agencies and academics. One week a year the image processing buisiness had an annual open house where we invite all users to a week long conference to talk about new features and discuss everything image processing related. Coincidently the conference occured two weeks after the Waco Texas siege. During the conference two users from an unidentified agency told us that the FBI put in a request to use incendiary rounds at Waco.

nice short
IMHO tweeter/Facebook will be shut down next week
Lots of political rant about Twitter. My issue is that it’s perhaps detrimental to hear from people in blips and blurbs through out the day. There’s no real need for it. Society is just getting used to social media. All social media have challenges. But I feel like Twitter even more than others appeals to people’s worse angels. So for that reason and at this price I’m not a fan
"With Twitters support of anything liberal, they have allowed majority in both executive and legislative branch. We can thank them for loss of free speech and $1.9 trillion spending that will cause inflation this country has never seen before.￼"

Twitter is not for long term investment. It is good for swing traders. CEO is mentally unstable so does stock price
This stock has zero retail support and is being held up completely by hedge funds using their wealthy clients money.
Be prepared if you own Twitter time to get out. Internet providers are canceling Twitter on there platforms!!Stock is going to drop like a rock!! by June I estimate it will be at 10 bucks!!
jack Dorsey is going to announce mandatory vaccines for all twtr users and this will fly to $100... Its for your safety
"Wow, down 3%. Parler is now up and running. If you like big government, like to be told what to do & what to think, then stay with Twitter. If you love our country, love our flag, love our way of life then cancel Twitter and join us at Parler."
Ouch! Down 2.5% and the trends look bad. Could it be because of Parler?

"Sue Jack, Save Freedom.""In recent days I’ve been made aware of dozens of conversations by former Twitter users that thousands of people might not only be eligible to sue #BigTweet but expect a bit of a payday in doing so.Beginning the day following the January 6th activities in Washington, DC, Jack Dorsey got aggressive, hostile, and intentional in the mishandling of his enterprise.The argument that Twitter—as a private company—can do what they wish with impunity is holding less water as the scope of the malfeasance is coming to light.By estimates from my own observation and discussion with others, Dorsey intentionally maligned the welfare of his company. In most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecond.His actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld. Given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of Twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectations.And last week Jack Dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath. He did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation. His actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to $7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product: an audience.So there are plenty of reasons shareholders, the public, and former Twitter users should consider legal recourse."""

The smart ones have sold already. The real decline will occur once TWTR is forced to publish the reduced subscribership statistics. That will be a beautiful event.
Matt? Sam? How are those Puts?

"Great to see local Los Angeles business owners support Project Roomkey. With 50,000 empty hotel rooms in the city and tens of thousands of homeless it’s a pretty amazing opportunity. FEMA will back the funds, it puts the hotels back in business, and the people will have dignity. This isn’t the stuff Elon Musk steps up to do. No money in helping homeless, they can’t use a dog coin."

Short Twitter
"Further thoughts on the upgrade... today is the day that margin calls would be completed. If someone had a large Twitter position and needed to dump it, issuing the upgrade today would make lots of sense... Down from here."
Retraced on weak volume; a drop on increase volume is coming before the close.
"When at least 50% of the population value their First Amendment right of free speech, that does bode well for companies that actively try to censor it. I cannot imagine Twitter or Facebook will do well until this issue is resolved."
I’m from Texas. All my friends will stop using Twitter. It actually isn’t a big deal. Most don’t use it much anyway.
surprised people are willing to hold this over the weekend. I would expect monday next week to be another gap down day to start another down week.
Larry s inching 60. Hooray 
"Do the following facts indicate a buying or selling/shorting opportunity for Twitter: negative earnings, no dividend, small number of shares shorted, controversial CEO, lawsuit filed against the company for child sexual abuse on Jan, 20, recent loss of up to 100 million platform users, and the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab. Seems clear to me that the stock price of Twitter is more likely to go down than up."
"A lot of calls and puts above and below the current price, expiring Friday. I wouldn’t be surprised if it traded around the current price until then."
f' look @ ACRX we have a news leak!! ACRX up huge on record Volume!!$fb $aapl buy & hold

the share price is now equal to the average I Q of a democrat
This will soon be like MySpace... We’ll all look back and laugh that we used this service once...
This is very clearly being held up by the establishment. They can only do that for so long tho. Only a matter of time before we see 30s!

"Forget shorting Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Those companies are not nearly as vulnerable to business drop as Twitter is. They will do their own thing tomorrow, but Twitter will be dying like there is no tomorrow."
This company made themselves a tgt. That does not align with what I want as a share holder!
Their earnings in Feb will show a big drop in subscribers. I wouldn’t hold this stock into earnings.

NOW they have eliminated him and many of his followers.....HMMM....where is Twitter headed....to the sewer.Florida now seeking to divest the state of Twitter, FB, Apple, Google and Amazon...Good luck to those companies."
All this noise and it’s down $2.84 form all time high. Keep chasing
I gave Twitter the worst rating in an Apple store. I also wrote a scathing critique of them. Do the same. I wish this company would go bankrupt. That anyone who invests in it will lose all their money.
Deleted my account and not going back!
As it now appears the titans of MSM/SocialMedia together with the DeepState/Socialist/Marxist/Globalist cabal have won. No other reason to explain the Orwellian stock of Twtr to rise other than that. But 1st impressions can be misleading. It's either a Republic or an arm of the CCP.
Just realized Ive lost more twitter follwers than Sleepy Joe has supporters.
"Traders who attempted to cancel the sale were met with a message telling them the sale couldn’t be undone, “as we placed it to mitigate the risk to your account.”"
You should really try not using Twitter or FB for a week. The effects are truly surprising.
This tuerd will not float. Artificially propped up.
"Up today on very light volume. When their very negative fundamentals kick-in, this stock is going to fall like Jimmy Hoffa's cement tomb in the middle of a lake."

"The end of Twitter is not near. The decline of Twitter toward a very poor choice among many similar service providers is well underway.

Hello Red
Twitter going down because it's financially unable to make money. and that's good because they are enemy of people and censor tool. besides Jihadi Jack is addicted to different heavy drugs and can't think at all.
"Any idea how the University Dean turned Foundation Director turned two-times impeached President going to get around his legal agreement not to use Big-o-Lardo as a residence?Is Rudy working on that after he sues Deutsche Bank for refusing to lend his client any more money and the PGA for cancelling their tournaments? Bigly?...but, but, but Obama, but, but, but Hillary, but, but, but, putt, putt, putt..."
Jack is probably surrounded by 10 guys 24hrs a day right now.
it is not like twitter has any real assets. It is valued on the number of users and how long they stay on the platform. Other countries besides ours are waking up to the threat of big tech. It is just not the U.S. anymore.
Hope this goes to $10
"Green again trending to 60.00. $14.00 gain since January. for those who sold back in Jan. ""snooze you lose "" you the man Dorsey"
"BTW, there is no such things called conspiracy theories. They are all possibilities, could be false or could be true. When something happens, which could be anything in this universe, whose cause is apparently unknown, to investigate or analyze why did it happen investigators come up with several possibilities e.g. theories. Then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause. That's the process. 100 years ago Albert Einstein's created many theories that were not proven at all until now. So if you use conspiracy theory then Albert Einstein's theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well - right? In his theory, legendary scientist Stephen Hawking said black holes could emit radiation, it's called Hawking Radiation. Not proven, no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true. So Hawking's theory is a conspiracy theory - right? Once again there is no such things called conspiracy theories - instead they are all possibilities, could be true could be false."

cancel Twitter! this co is DONE. pull your money out its a bad investment!
I love cashing in on conservative tears!They're delicious 
"Twitter – Trying to re-find relevance before it is too lateIt is important to note the major demographic headwinds Twitter is facing. Youth and Millennials are not flocking to Twitter (pardon for the pun) except in rare cases to view announcements from their favorite pastimes (sports, music, entertainment, finance, politics). They very much prefer Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (plus many one-off versions thereof). Twitter exists for them, but only in passing. They are the future of communication and social media. Jack & Company would prize this demographic if it could break into it better.To the youth of today, Twitter (which has been around FOREVER in their minds) is the Yahoo! of yesteryear. I know of what I speak, my millennial son (& daughter) refuse to check Twitter even for information about his own college sports team (he is on)! They are addicted to the other venues; he and my daughter have no interest in what Lady Gaga had for lunch or how good or bad whatever administration in office is.On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Boomers who comprise ~30% of the US population. They live, breath and die Facebook (connect to family, friends). Remember the commercial where the lady used Post-it notes for her posts on the dry erase board? That captured many a boomer’s attention. Within the past year some created secondary ‘social media’ Twitter accounts to discuss politics. As-of late, few have stayed, but many have fled back to the friendly confines of Facebook.In the middle is where Jack & Co. exist, the Gen-X, Gen-Z and other folk between 32 and 55. They want to know stuff and they want to know now. They do have very solid buying power and are attractive to advertisers. With the new business model they are working on, he and the executive team are trying to upsell this demographic the best they can. Announcing paid content, paid accounts to follow, and anything that could generate revenue off the main focus group.It is unfortunate, and not likely, the other ends of the social media demographic pie will ever migrate; Twitter management knows this only too well. As the millennials age, they will take up more and more room on the social media spectrum and unfortunately, Yahoo! (sorry, I meant Twitter) is not going to be in their wheelhouse.Many of that middle group are now exiting for different discussion venues, and that is important loss Jack & Co. have to overcome. Twitter is a STATUS application. In the ‘biz’ we call it ‘push communications’. You can ‘push’ out content and status, but as for the true ‘social’ backbone, it is very narrow; Twitter was never engineered to be a BLOG. Remember, they even reported user interactions down in Q4 and we have yet to even see a taste of Q1.Telegram is a MAJOR apple cart disrupter for Twitter. They are engineered to be a major ‘push’ engine. Channels are subscribed to and push information to users. There are discussions in Chat Channels, but nothing compared to the subscribed channels with folk waiting for information.Why do I bring up Telegram? In a short amount of time they have almost doubled the number of users Twitter has. They are growing quickly. There is ALWAYS a new kid on the block trying to win the social media beat down game.Parler you say? Niche only. Folk disgruntled ONLY about a political outcome seem to be over there. Between it and GAB and CloutHub, they may have drained off 10% of the Twitter user attention.So where does this leave Jack & Co. They are completely redoing their business model to capture the ‘middle dollars’. Boomers, Millennials and youth won’t pay for them. Advertisements are nice but non-middle demographic folk already have one-click Amazon prime accounts and know what they want. They are getting harder and harder to influence.So where does that leave Twitter compared to the big dog, Facebook?Facebook earns $10.09 per share. It has a P/E of 25.98 given a price of $262. Facebook market cap is 745.83B. Financially speaking, they are under valued for a social media platform.Twitter earns -$1.44 per share and has no P/E. Twitter market cap is 61.91B. Twitter with a current price of $77 would have to earn $4 per share to support the same P/E (check my math). Yes, they just earned 39 cents in Q4 and projecting a loss Q1 of 2021. The hill is super steep.Maybe Jack & Co. can get to $4 share in EPS, maybe not. He has to put all the boots on the ground or Twitter really has no bright future given their narrow demographic constraints and social media ‘push’ platform.Be careful out there chasing stocks or cars!"
A bit too overvalued.
This should be treated like I treated the SuperSonics back in ‘96.
Hedge funds are beginning to jump ship...

"I think TWTR is going to be hit the worst from deactivations, more so than FB and AMZN. Nothing of personal significance is lost by deactivating TWTR; FB is most likely where families and friends stay in touch, and AMZN is AMZN (though I've long started to diversify my online purchases, anyway). I think FB could see more Instagram account cancellation."

down 20% already !! let’s make it 50%!!! take Dorsey on a reality check!
Any other stock with news of this magnitude would be all over the news. You try to find an article or discussion on any of these platforms about what’s going to happen to this stock tomorrow......it’s crickets.
Millions of Twitter accounts closed. This stock will drop like a rock.
"Sorry to here the polar Vortex , which was predicted, is going to cause hardship in USA. Solar And Wind power doesn’t cut it! Natural gas when it’s cold is the way to go."
It’s rather appropriate that this thing takes a deep dive. It’s lost billions of shareholders money through absolutely horrific management and decision making. The real question is how do freaks like Dorsey get into positions like this??
"Uh oh, Parler's back. Twitter faces headwinds in the market for spite, bitterness and bile."
"Sell Twitter stock, there are major problems coming in the stock. There is insider info leaking out"
"I think Twitter has forgot that Americans will make you but they can break you , too!!!"

Never posted before on finance but Twitter has bitten the hand.... unreal

So glad to see people making money on this. GL GL GL

Removed twitter and Facebook from my phone. Already happier.
Remember diamond hands! We can moon this like GME!
We won We won.
"So when a company that has negative earnings creates a situation that produces negative growth and incites protests against the constitutional rights.... the buy point is what???? Out of business.

I also expect to see peaceful protests at these companies and the senior leadership soon"

Yahoo story on Ashli Babbitt is disgusting.

Everyone be sure to thank a Veteran . They fought for our right to freedom of speech. We as civilians failed them. I for one am ashamed and deeply sorry. They bled on foreign soil for it and we paid big tech to take it away. To any vet reading this thank you so much. I vow to do better

"A real schlapp in the face when Twitter users saw the obvious odal rune shape at cpac. It wasn’t even hidden. German police train school children from 4 on up, on how to recognize these symbols and turn people in. Because Germany is actually smart about the rising Turner-Don Diary movement. I would feel sorry for these cpac-ers, but really why? They promote the white protestsnt work morality. And while I can sympathize with small businesses owners who are strapped, especially during the pandemic, if a profit margin depends on paying employees a wage that keeps them on the edge of poverty if not deep in it, the fault is in the business plan. This holds true for the multi-national, or bank, with their hand out for taxpayer assistance, that isn’t also given to the taxpayer at equal levels. Remember, cpac speakers didn’t want to give any stimulus."
Just think the tech companies that now monitor and control every aspect of American life were seeded w/ taxpayer money. Gotta luv it.
This is falling a long way today after Project Veritas let out the tape of Dorsey.

"Of the first 13 arrested in Capitol Hill unrest, zero had Parler accounts. The vast majority of planning or discussion of heading to Capitol Hill took place on Facebook and YouTube. Google owns YouTube so they can’t possibly block their own site. Big Tech must be sanctioned, financially penalized and broken up in a way that this never happens again.

So glorious to see Twitter and longs win out here after dropping dmbazz! Lol. Magnificent.
"Surprised it hasn't fallen further. There's a huge exodus away from the both Twitter and Facebook occurring at the moment, judging by the numbers deluging alt tech sites.

Thanks to the reckless immigration policies of this sham administration 15 people, albeit illegals, were transformed into placemats when the vehicle they were stacked in, like cord wood, collided with a semi along the border with Mexico. The logical response from this abomination of an administration would be to provide busses with a police escort, at the taxpayers expense, to ensure they make it to the sanctuary city of their choosing where they can hide out until Boondoggle Bydoon can wave his magic wand and pronounce them ""legal citizens"".BTW.

"Just pulled this from an article published today from Tipbanks:Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz believes that the ban could pose significant hurdles to the company’s 2021 mDAUs (monetizable daily active users) and ad revenue “on top of already tough COVID user compares,” which he estimates added about 3 million and 15 million incremental US and outside US mDAUs (estimated), respectively, last year.Zgutowicz further stated that his scenario analyses indicated that the ban could wipe off 6 million-9 million US mDAUs this year. The analyst argued that the move, along with tough COVID-induced user growth comparables, leave the company a “little room to deliver positive ’21 results.” The analyst reiterated a Hold rating on Twitter and lowered his price target slightly to $39 from $40."

I thought freedom of speech is when you can voice a different perspective on truth. The research you do to make a winning stock trade should also be made in how you understand the news ! Follow a variety of news outlets and watch a half hour each day of MSNBC FOX CNN and even 15 minutes of NEWSMAX. By doing this you will have a great balance on what the truth is. If you follow news on the net such as Twitter or Facebook and focus on as many as two similar articles whether positive or negative those platform's algorithms will feed you similar stories backing up the same view. This puts people in a herd of thinkers that could follow lies and false beliefs. These algorithms are not acceptable to freedom of finding the truth ! It could lead many down a dark rabbit hole. Many who lost work because of covid shut downs seemed to want to follow reasons why they lost their jobs. Its because of covid and I feel their pain. Just as the algorithmic codes run the stock market we still do our research to see the truth.please understand sites like Twitter and Facebook haven't focused on what's true because they make greater fees if they take you down whatever rabbit hole you choose. Remember your worth more than your financial success. Things will get better you have to have social emotional physical and spiritual success in your life to be balanced. I know most or at least many feel financial success may be the greatest of them all ! Know that covid has tested each of us and many are fed-up with life ! This time in our history will soon pass and brighter days are ahead.

Wow. Lin Wood on Parler views shows why Twitter is in trouble. The views are insane as his followers increase to over 1.1 million. Ashli is alive while Twitter and the other horrific Facebook went along to destroy our freedoms. 5.2 million views. https://parler.com/profile/linwood/posts

"TWTR stock without profits, no dividend yield and the earning per share -1.58.I don't believe that the retail investors spend over 40 bucks/shr to invest to this Junk. Financial institution hold this Junk now they want to get out, so they trade back & forth to PUMP & DUMP this Junk. Watch out for the trap..."
This company is a dog waiting to die. They are propping it up as much as possible but when earnings comes out it's going to be a catastrophe don't wait around for the big red candles. they are going to have to explain to shareholders what the hell they were thinking? the trouble is there is no explanation for their communist censorship Behavior

TWTR continued down after hours
A lot of people will or have cancelled their Twitter account; just as a lot of people decided to not invest in $TWTR any longer - sell any stock and don't invest in an ETF or a Mutual Fund that contains it. Both will impact the share price. Lot's of other places to invest and make $.

"Never seen a business that thought getting rid of half their customers overnight was a good idea. I wouldn't do business with people that think that way.

"As an addendum you can find easily, $TWTR EPS average estimates are as follows;2021 - $0.88 per share2022 - $1.13 per shareIF they hit average estimates, TWTR is 4+ more times overvalued than Facebook. $TWTR is not a new start-up but considered a decently long-in-the-tooth legacy tech company founded in 2006, now 15 years old. Can you believe it???"

"$AMZN - Now that Amazon is being sued by Parler for removing them from their hosting site AWS for allegedly violating Amazon's standards, will they be inclined to remove $TWTR and $FB, two of their largest clients for the same reasons? People post violence and threats all day long on FB and TWTR."

A whistleblower inside Twitter recorded CEO Jack Dorsey and sent Project Veritas the recording.

The little blue bird is down substantially in after hours trading. This market closes at 8 pm. Better sell immediately before it drops even further. Tomorrow will be a brutal day for Big Tech companies like Twitter.
If you read the Parler update on the website it’s very clear that the CEO of Parler is a far superior thinker and person than the Twitter CEO.

"MEMPHIS (The Borowitz Report)—QAnon, which has hemorrhaged supporters since Inauguration Day, has announced that it is merging with the conspiracy theory that claims Elvis Presley is still alive. The announcement, made at a press conference in a parking lot across the street from Graceland, Presley’s longtime home, was seen as a bid to prevent QAnon from vanishing altogether.The overture to the Elvis conspiracy theorists came after QAnon proposed a similar merger with the National Rifle Association, which declined, citing difficulties of its own."

Per O'Keefe more on Dorsey to follow. The 1st release was showing Dorsey telling his inner circle the game plan to take 1/2 of the population down. By Monday there will be so much more. O'Keefe is trying to get the leakers to interview (with voice altered and pic blacked out). It takes a brave sole to do that.

You investors in Twitter stock need to see the writing on the wall. Stock may be artificially held up but not for long. People ( Democrats and Republicans) that believe in free speech are leaving. There is no hope. Stock will be 20 by the end of February.

Breaking: jack Dorsey calls to bring George Washington back to life so he can be properly cancelled and impeached.
Is it time to short this anti free speech company? If so any recommendations on option strategy? This run up seems counter intuitive.
"haven't used Twitter or facebook for a about a year now and I don't miss one bit. I never had an issue with any of the platforms, I just found myself living through them more and more and had to make a change. One of the best decisions i could've ever made. My life and overall mindset has improved greatly over the last year. I still have many open accounts that I am deleting today. I hope this catches on and sticks because I really do feel that it is for the better of every single individual person. Go out and talk face to face with people, so that you can develope real relationships with real emotions. It is natural and healthy."

"Ever ask yourself why 75 million people STILL believe this election was stolen? Maybe it’s just me but people don’t like having their candidates chosen for them. Everyone saw what they saw and no matter how much propaganda you cannot erase this criminality out of the heads of that many people. It was in your face and overt. Big Tech fully complicit in this criminal behavior and Jack, et al should be prosecuted under the RICO statutes. Sell ."

"Telegram Sees 25 Million New Users in 72 HoursMessaging app Telegram has seen a massive surge in new users, largely by those concerned about their privacy."

"Twitter also controlled tweets directed at liberal politicians. Your tweet will appear but no one can see it , this is how bad their censorship has gotten."
"Twitter will eventually be under 20. The attraction of Twitter is arguing with people you do not agree with. Once Twitter is nothing but a liberal love fest, it will not be fun and people will lose interest"
this stock will be cheaper than a subway sandwich come this summer.
i wish someone would do a large market sell order already 
This is just the start of the decline.. Joe's policies will put a halt to the markets.. all of them..

Thanks Parler people! Bought some twtr early today. Nice profit!! Keep up the good covering.
All you need to do is look at the March 19 way out of the $ Puts are all up big today and ask why? Earnings report in Feb will be a disaster when they have to disclose how many users deleted their accounts. Time is running out to get out!
Huge loses coming tomorrow or Monday...Jack was just caught on hidden camera talking about his political agenda. project veritas will be releasing the video tomorrow I believe.

Good earnings
Why would anyone buy the stock of a company that is run by someone trying to take American rights away ?
Bye jack
Investing in Twitter isn't good for your finances. Good thing I predicted this would happen.
This stock should be in the 20s and lawsuits should be filed ASAP
FB just hit the 6-month low mark!
FCC going to take control. Like they were suppose to 20 years ago.
Why TWTR when you've got Yahoo message boards.
"Across the board, the financial establishment has reacted with outrage to the surge in what previously were considered dead stocks. Industry insiders have taken to TV to decry the amateur investors, hedge fund billionaires have demanded the government intervene on their behalf, and investment firms have bailed out their short-selling colleagues who lost tens of billions of dollars when the stocks rose, instead of falling as they predicted."
SELL! Rumor is this will tank very soon! Not a joke!
"Twtr has over 75,000,000 enemies for life who will at any opportunity will do what they can to bring them DOWN."
"Sell twitter, fb, apple, googleBuy EV stocks NIO and Tessla"
Here’s another kicker. Twitter users are banning companies that advertise on Twitter. Soooo bad for business. Huge ouch!
Green!!
"Dumped Twitter! I have now Telegram and very happy, like other 500 milion active users."
Twitter stock is a terrible investment.
"Q1 earning on Feb 09, 2021.....I think the number of users will drop significantly."
Stop the steal
you think Dorsey cares about the share holders?
Time to buy useful stocks like Tesla and Pharmaceutical.A Big dump is coming for Twitter and Facebook.
Do you think Twitter can survive as long as the rioting going on in Portland?
"Last night there was a priated video of Dorsey addressing his employees. Key take aways from his majesty:-Twitter will continue to censor right wing tweets-He has the moral authority to ""protect"" the american public.Can anyone remember what Josef Stalin said about opposing views in Pravda?"
Twitter is recklessly putting their political agenda before their shareholders.
"This just in: twitter to rename itself ""planning and praise app for antifa""."
"Social media was a fun pastime, until shadowbanning and now outright banning of people. The annoyance of having your account suspended because you hurt some snowflakes feeling by using real words... like there are only 2 sexes, should have been sufficient warning that political correctness was becoming more important than reality."
Bidding it up so the 25% routing its about to get doesnt seem as bad.
"Remember they push it higher on low volume so they can unload their positions at a good price. This will keep falling to reflect a price around 13 dollars. Write the following numbers down as you continue to short for a profit : Average Price: 47.8788 (50-day) 39.54 (200-day)Average Volume: 13,820,501 (50-day) 19,138,036 (200-day)"
"Was a Financial Principal of a NASD firm. Do not be surprised that the assumption TWTR will collapse Monday doesn't happen to the degree it should. The bad news is money will be pouring in to support the price of the stock. The good news is the SEC has the buyer information that can be traced back to the monies who purchased the stock. Also, the NASDQ should collapse based on their many abuses of our freedoms. Again don't be surprised if it initially doesn't happen."
Well congratulations to Cuckoo Dorsey and Crazy Joe they successfully wrecked the market in 8 days of teamwork.
What is the point of Twitter if all it's good for is censoring people
Jack n mark trying to please comrade Xi by censoring american so that they can get in China. $FB $TWTR
look at those numbers wait until next earnings this is a $20 stock. How does Adam shift still have a Twitter with all his misinformartion?
Liberals money
"who ever bought at 80, don't worry. you will be laughing when this explosion to $100 at earnings happens"
Dorsey on the Veritas recording with the face of the Marxist saying it's time to take the opposition down....and guess what? The vote is with him as the stock opened up. Guess there are more people who hate the Constitution and We the People than I thought.
"not a good week for this stock, next week will be eve worse."
2 more hour until market futures print.. How far down will they be?
"I sure enjoy watching this conitinue to drop, we would like to see it drop faster, millions of us. One thing is for sure, the actions to censor the American Patriots IS going to lead to competition. As soon as #45GOAT announces his suppprt for a platform, thats when this #$%$ crashes."
Continue to short this stock close all long positions.
Chart Update: Of Course TWTR Is Very Overbought! Plus Market Is Headed Down!
Jack in the near future.

"So it's wasn't the RUSSIANS RUSSIANS RUSSIANS after all, it was the CHINESE CHINESE CHINESE and China Joe and his pdo son were all for it."
"I agree, countries should ban Twitter, In the US as it is a monopoly it should be regulated."
Gain or loose money I’m shorting Twitter on principle
I smell the stench of panic here.....or is that Jack's beard.
It's reached the point that calling things 'conspiracy theories' are just convenient dismissals the left-use to dismiss uncomfortable truths. The truth is more shocking now than any conspiracy theory out there...
ummm what is that clicking sound.. oh it's millions of people deleting their twitter accounts!!!! bye bye
$3 Billion written off so far. Dead cat bounce won't last the morning lull. lol
Might find support at $30. Until then. Better money to be made buying value stocks that don’t pick political correctness over neutrality.
$TWTR closed down over 5%. Only news was an outright lie from Dow Jones that $TWTR fell 2.8% (news at 4:02 ET). Deep State in Finance. This will could get interesting.
a lot of people losing money today on options I see
"Everybody should SHORT Twitter, FB, Amazon, and Apple... They'll be going down big times!"
"Twitter, FB, appleSold all shares and will NEVER buy again. Twitter actions prove that they are not fair and report only news they feel is appropriate. No freedom of speech with these companies. I urge everyone to stay away from these socialist companies"
"TWTR-SEC violation= When will TWTR make the timely disclosure of a MATERIAL DROP IN subscribers?Note Trial lawyers! Will you sue a ""Democrat"" company???/hmmmmmm"
Does Mike Pence have a twitter account? Face Book account? Instagram? Has he posted anything since Jan 6th?
anybody going to short this today?
I deleted 45 fake accounts and my one real account.. I also deleted the apps from all my mobile devices..
"Let me think, I could buy shares in this company which has NO products, makes NO money, and what little they made they handed it away to BLM, or FOR ABOUT THE SAME MONEY, I could buy shares in a real company LISTED on the Dow 30 like Cisco, Walgreens, Coca Cola, Verizon etc..."
"Twitter compare to FB is one trick pony, their business will be hurt much more. Users of Twitter are more politically active. Conservative part will be heard, maybe not by voices, but by loosing revenue."
10 a share come summer.
It’s not over till it’s over - “ we’ve just begun “Tuesday another 1-3% down 12 months of decline sounds great  Deactivate accounts - all biz and personal Sell and short this anti American company
"Glad I didn't take profits given TWTR saying rev double to $75Bby 2023..if so, stock is CHEAP"
Was really hoping the stock would drop a lot more than 6% today well there's always tomorrow
"When you have a platform that kicks off the conservative voices of your choice, how is this going to help stockholders and is Jack Dorsey simply ignoring the 2nd amendment? The answer is 100% yes and why I am shorting Twitter. If you are in this stock, Monday is not going to be fun!"
Made a little $ shorting from just over $50 down to $44ish a few weeks back. Reopening a short just over $55 now. GL to all.
Now we don't have Democracy but DemoCRAZY....Haaaaa!
"Big legal trouble for TWTR. On their last 10Q under Risk factors the closest they come to censorship is what others do to them and not the other way around.....This is what I found....actions by governments or others to restrict access to Twitter or censor content on Twitter, such as how domestic Internet service providers in China have blocked access to Twitter and other countries, including Iran, Libya, Pakistan, Turkey and Syria, have intermittently restricted access to Twitter, whether these actions are taken for political reasons, in response to decisions we make regarding governmental requests or content generated by people on Twitter, or otherwise;"
I dont want to panic anybody or anything but TWTR IS CRASHING!!
"By the time Dorsey is finished getting rid of all Twitter's customers - uh I mean human inventory - that don't fit in with his little Silicon Valley echo chamber, their stock price won't even buy you a latte at Starbucks."
this company needs to tank big time....let's go
Leave your politics at home Twitter. Censorship is not good.
I cancelled Twitter because they are not focused on shareholder value. Their new mission is political cancel culture. I’m out.
Head and Shoulders on the 30 and the 1yr chart shows 42 possibly today
No free speech for you Mr. John Q. American! So says Xi Jingping and his right hand man Jack. Sell.
Conservatives just CANCLE Twitter and short it !Enjoy some liberals cash
"Twitter basher should just go & do something productive to better their own self,,, Twitter to a $100s level anytime soon. Hi Brenda!"
"And the Emmy for ""Lyin' Dog Faced Pony Soldier"" goes to.......... Mario ""Everyone Dies, So What?"" Cuomo!!!!!!!!!!!!"
A lots people is selling share soon..will see happening
I canceled Twitter. Too risky to continue. Haters will manipulate this stock. Not worth it! Bye bye
The tech giants would rather see tens of thousands of innocent people die than allow this information out to the public. We have never seen anything like this.On Saturday we heard word that Tom Fitton is still suspended off of Twitter — 14 days later. Tom is a leading voice for truth in this nation.
Maga RALLY in front of Dorsey's mansion ASAP
A buy at about $30.
"The government owns the internet and these big exploiting it to suppress the constitutional rights of people...Time to shut down big tech, they are funded by taxpayers...time for them to pay us back with their multibillion dollar profit.. ++++++++1"
Twitter claiming Texas AG Pattons lawsuits are bogus and that the AG’s suit should be thrown out because they are protected under the first amendment. What a laugh. If they are we are. Take this company down immediately. I hate fascists.
"Was Janet Yellen involved in the halting of trading in order to protect Citadel, a hedge fund that previously paid her nearly $1 million in speaking fees?"
"From THE $TWTR. Does that mean a loss or am I missing something???""For Q1'21, we expect:Total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.04 billionGAAP operating income to be between a loss of $50 million and break even"""
Sell your Twitter stock in protest of a communist company
"Florida State Rep. Randy Fine Tweets 'This morning I asked the Governor and Cabinet to divest the state from Amazon, Twitter, Apple, Google, and Facebook. They may get to decide who they do business with. So do we.' Florida i love the way you are thinking."
"If this stock survives at all, it's because AAPL and AMZN propped it up with massive amounts of share purchasing."
Nothing satisfies me more than the falling price of TWTR.
"I?ve never shorted a stock before but seriously thinking of shorting this #$%$ Monday, guaranteed winner. This stock deserves the beating it?s about to get.Let?s change the term ?social media? to what it really is ?socialist media?"
People are bailing on Twitter and going to Gab who says they are adding 1 million users a day and are the fastest growing site in history
Wall Street and TWTR is celebrating because 1 million people have lost their jobs. Good for China .
"Truth is a scary thing, when you’re on the wrong side of it."
Anybody has an idea technically how deep this could fall? $220-$230 short term possible? Looks like downwards pressure is building for $FB en $TWTR Tia
Funny people dont understand TWITTER IS OVER .... whoever buys now is toasted
I sold my shares and thank you Jack for been a hero make me losing $$$
India is banning Twitter from being used in their country. India is #3 in the world for Twitter users. India is taking a stand against corporations that are silencing free speech.
No upward movement. Could the 20 million accounts have switched over to Parler?
just so you guys know twitter had two previous quarters WITH profit. snap is losing money. snap touts they have more daily users. guess what? twitter revenue is higher than snap revenue every quarter. if snap is so great how come they have less revenue while having more daily users??? aside from that twitter is profitable. snap is not. and on top of all this snap market cap is nearly twice that of twitter all while having less revenue than twitter and not being profitable as twitter is? how does this make sense?!
I'll go long on this when it's trading for 30c in the OTC markets...
Don’t forget the 10% for the big guy.
There's one huge bubble waiting to pop & Twitter may be what ignites everything. Lets see if SEC has anything to say about biased treatment of customers and total disregard for shareholders
I deactivated my account
"Everyone realizes we are no different that people fighting for kings and their lands 500 years ago. When it is all over the masses get nothing.The kings get the land and riches and we slay each other for nothing.Right or Left, Censorship is not going to help this country.Clearly there are people of common sense on both sides, yet we let the 10% of extremists on the left and the 10% extremists on the right, fire us up.When that stops our country will be what it should be. Turn off the media, that will help."
"Twitter, Facebook, Google Apple have been colluding for a while with each other and refer to each other multiple times as ""PEERS"". They are not peers they are competitors. Any action together as peers violate Anti Trust laws but more importantly have recently lead them to act on their own feelings instead of what is in the best interest of their shareholders. I really think those hurt by Jack Dorsey's incompetence should start a class action and sue Twitter."
where is the bottom?
Wow so it’s true. I made a sensible comment that yahoo didn’t like and it deleted it.
Twitters censorship is becoming increasingly more tactical. This will surely bring revolution.It had better stop if you want this county (freedom) to stay in our hands.
"hey you guys ready for Obama 2.0??? looks like all these cabinet members are Obama rejects showing up again.WOW, just think we already had 8 years of NOTHING, we will get 4 more????? Make America Poor Again.MAPA.. New slogan."
why is this stock going up?
Twitter opposes free speech. Delete your account. I have. Encourage others to do the same. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Sell your stock.
"Institunional investors will soon start runing away. How can any respectable firm put it's money into a company, that is so unpredictable. What if one day, after a long crack smoking session, Jack Dorsey will deside that Twitter will fund North Korea's nuclear program? How reliable is that?"
"Does yahoo, aol and twitter pay their anti first amendment censors $15.00 an hour and give them healthcare."
Love seeing the stock drop like a rock!! It seems to have alienated half of America who may deleted the app. Might be the first stock I ever shorted!! Seems like a perfect one to try it on
what goes better with conservative tears? hot dogs or hamburgers?
"Is anyone buying here to hold? Or is this now a trading stock? Not sure I would buy at over $70/ share. I own from some time ago, still holding, although starting to think it is getting closer to sell time."

There she blows. welcome to fake News on that upgrade.
I would like to thank all the Twitter bashers and haters. the more you post the higher the stock price goes. you bashers are making me a lot of money.

"JUST one simple question to ASK: Why risk your hard-earned money on this fast-loosing-user TWTR stock? There are so many good stocks / ETFs to make money, SELL TWTR! SELL TWTR! BUY ARKK/ARKW/ARKQ/ARKG!!"
"Never went on Twitter and I'll probably be deleting my Facebook too. Be careful what you wish for Lefties, because it could be YOU who is censored one day. Society's new mantra is - shutup and take it and do what you are told. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is dead.Is it not curious that all the big names are dropping Parler in lockstep? Eliminate your competition when you see blood in the water. There's no reason Parler should be shutdown.Whether you know it or not, you are being controlled in order to make rich people richer. Guess who's getting richer during the COVID pandemic? It ain't the average American. It's big corporations, 1%ers, and the D.C. power circle. Draconian restrictions and lockdowns has caused more harm around the world than the virus itself. China. Guess who else has ties with China? Your new President."
"Based on the Project Veritas video and Dorsey's arrogance toward the American people, I will be shorting his stocks (Twit and Square) until they are out of existence. You like cancel culture Jack? You will see how it works when money cancels you. I urge all stockholders to do the same. Let's show Jack who is really in charge."
"The same reason these tech companies have section 230 they used their power to shut down opposition and censor even the POTUS. Are you serious? We have a Constitution, and can't wait to see the results of all this. I promise todays valuations of these Big Tech will lose BIG. They have gotten too big for their own good."
"“A leaked recording of a top Twitter official suggests the company will have a ""global approach"" when it comes to tackling misinformation as critics in recent weeks have sounded the alarm on political censorship.”I’m sure the Europeans and others will love when they see this. The end is near TWTR."
"Triple digits handle coming for TWTR. It lagged Facebook for years because they couldn't find ways to make money on the app. Now they are projecting huge revenues so that hurdle is cleared. This will be a HUGE mover in 2021,"
Get ready to leave this platform...pay-off all your debt with TWTR short. Parler will win antitrust suit.
"Now the Dumbocrats are talking about giving families 300 dollars per month for each child. Where is all this money coming from? I did some math. If you stacked a trillion dollars if would go around the world approximately two and a half times. Oh let's pay off student debt. The educated people make the most money. You don't have to drive $50,000 cars. This is just the beginning. Their nuts."
downgrade coming? over valued? my opinion
Bets guess this week will see another 12% drop.

When it goes to 50 cent Jack will give an executive order to reverse split this stock. That will get the price back up so he can continue his reign.

"Amazon web services is not the only web service providers in the World. Other companies are selling web services so parler can goto Amazons competitors but parler can also build their own web servers and not rely on left wing run companies like Microsoft, Amazon etc. and therefore not need Amazon or Microsoft to flourish and then parler can ban liberal democrat companies from using its web services."
"Uh-oh, DOW Futures are down tonight; that would be 4 consecutive down days for the DOW, possibly indicating the start of the long anticipated Bear Market. If I was a Twitter bag-holder, I would be a little nervous about the near term prospects of Twitter's SP. Just saying."
this news fundamentally isnt any plausible reason for pump. all they are saying is that they will increase revenue by adding more features. how do you know some other app might come out and eat up market share? how do you know the added features will add new users as they say? instagram created that feature thats similar to tiktok that didnt boost fb price sky high like this? i think people are ganging up in here because theyre tired of the market managers turning february into an extremely bearish month.
Does anyone have a good securities lawyer? I want to sue twitter for beach of fiduciary duty to shareholders.
dorsey havin a good time
I want to thank Jack for making all shorts rich......
I think Twitter has made a big mistake. My opinion!
Best short in the entire stock market. Sub $10 in 6 months.
"Will donate any money I made shorting this stock to any Trump fundraiser, especially for 2024 campaign, have been short since Monday...keep falling Twitter, thanks for the easy money! ha ha"

It also guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and to petition their government."
Go $70s
This is what happens when you condone this censorship based solely on your own beliefs. You can’t silence everyone you don’t agree with and think you won’t get backlash. R.I.P. Twitter. Dorsey already looks like a homeless person. I can’t imagine what this will do to him.
When Democrats are impeaching someone just to prevent them from running again do we really live in a democracy

"Wow. Can you see advertising dollars disappearing as now those that advertise must realize that they are appealing to people who know people who know people. Why would anyone buy products or services unless you are one of those in favor of the #cancculture? Dorsey has fully expose his tyranny to all. So out of touch with the common man/women and the heart of what makes America, America."
It's Funny people don't believe Patriots have the Power. Jack should take a good hard look at what happened to the NFL MLB NBA the last few years
The deep state is full of shallow thinkers and they own TWTR. Sweet dreams.
im selling all my shares!! this stock is going tank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I sold all shares of TWTR because its speech control makes me feel that I'm living under a Communist country.

Hit deranged Jack where it hurts."
This should be shorted into the ground!!

Sell Twitter. The trend has begun
"Conservative patriots have started a snowball that will turn into a huge avalanche to crush the four-headed Big Tech monster (Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple) by sending a text message to their family and friends about alternative services (gab, directly from vendors or Walmart +, Me/We, DuckDuckGo). Please d your part."
"No more revenue sell and buy NIO now before you lose more money,"
I mean seriously anyone losing big money here and over the next four years. What were you all thinking anyway. There is no Capital Markets and Wealth from Capital Markets in Socialism the profits go to the people. The TWTR Marxist and communistic socialist societies must suppress views other then their owns to succeed. You're wealth lost in TWTR will only be transferred to those leff fortunate. All capital markets are doomed in ones controlled by socialists. We know this thus why are you here? Why are you even invested in any of these bloated equity stock issues that can't survive in Socialism .
censoring and deleting is also called tampering with evidence
Lenin would have made a great Ceo for Twitter

The paradox for TWTR may be that there is a lack of short interest in the stock. Nobody wants to be caught in another GME debacle. The stock rises because it is mainly day traders. Pump and dump. The stock will drop dramatically when the equilibrium fails.
Sell before this crashes! Not a joke

Time to start a CLASS ACTION. You longs should be sueing Dorsey and Twitter. He did not show due diligence and caused you to lose money.
"I see no upside for this stock , for months or maybe years."
"I shorted again this morning. Gotta remember, a 10% move in one day is generally a good time to take profits. However, there are exception. The air is coming out of Dorsey's balloon with predictable certainty! Also, I am a long in SRNE and INSM. Biotech is risky, but has tremendous upside! The institutions buy up biotech low, and then the standoff is for how many retail will sell their shares before the price explodes higher. In Twitter's case, the institutions were loaded up, and they're in a standoff for who blinks first. Meanwhile, retail has been exited on their intuition that this will not end well!"

When I look at TWTR I reflect on the dead sparrow I saw on the road today.
congratulations longs ) 66 as expected yesterday
Buying this stock now would be like buying into a Ponzi scheme. How can a company with a Market cap of $36 billion dollars and annual revenue of only $4 billion with very marginal profits be worth anywhere near $45 dollars per share. It is utter insanity.

I can't believe anyone would short this stock
"There are a lot of individual investors buying long. ""Put"" options are cheap for the 4/16 date. Could be easy money. Who knows?"
"I sold my shares and deleted my twitter account. I strongly oppose what the company is doing.However, the stock has significant upside based on valuation to peers and an incoming, friendly administration. Obama stated recently that big tech and government should work closely together. Philosophically, this is a disaster in my mind because I think we are an exceptional country based on our founding principles. If the new administration allows twitter and others to work around our rights when convenient, it will energize almost half the country. I believe TWTR could move to $100+ this year. Count me out regardless. I want no part of what is coming."
Market is up 600+ points
Down 10% today. TENS of millions will cancel this week. Plus million will be selling their shares. What Twitter did was wrong. Enjoy the ride DOWN.

"The Capitol Police has more than 2000 officers and an annual budget of $500 million, all to patrol 2 square miles of land. We don't need permanent fencing around the seat of US democracy. We need them to do their job.The EOs coming out of Washington are not what Americans want."
"What a very nice day for $TWTR longs to oscillate to the north. It has been a wild Mr. Toad's ride up and down. Remember, the company Q4 earnings press release predicted a 2021 Q1 loss (it was a quote). Protecting a gain long or short is never a bad call."
You can bet Dorsey and his mates are offloading their shares right now. Which he got for free incidentally.
held this for 6 years what a horrible investment I think just once it beat earning and gave a good forcast but the future looks very dim
True story! I was a union contractor in Chicago . I laid off over 150 democratic liberals and moved my head quarters to Florida. None union !They got pink slips January 1st !The moral of this story is liberals and unions destroy America

Why would anyone in his right mind own this stock??? #sellstock
"Why does the media facilitate Don Lemon trying to associate conservatives with any nasty hate group he can think of, including the clan and national socialists (such comparison being made on the basis of identity politics and not on true actions or beliefs--just whether he can produce an example of a bad person who happens to vote one way or the other and branding everyone that way)? It is a fact that no Republicans owned any slaves a year before the civil war, that the Republican party was formed to eliminate slavery, that the Republican party introduced civil rights legislation, and that the Democratic party (actions, not mere identity) supported slavery, jim crow, etc., well into the 1960s or so. In fact, why tear down statutes of dead people when you have the actual organization that did all that, alive and well today? Reparations? Go talk to the Democratic party."
My first time shorting and made 10k. Love this
I don’t own Twitter anymore. I’m here because I’m getting some kind of fantastic satisfaction seeing the downfall after the pent up frustrations of having the conservative voice suppressed. They all are getting what they deserve and I’m relieved.

Why are people paying $77 for a $40 stock?!? Lol.
We should learn from our past. The country cannot thrive or survive so divided. Very sad and both sides should be worried for the country.
In honor of POTUS 45 Take this down to 45....
Literally had just posted a comment about media controlling the message with Kamala Harris’ comments about allowing and encouraging riots to continue and how Twitter and Big Tech is doing the same to us. It was gaining traction and had 13-1 positive votes in less than 5 min and guess what? POOF!! It’s gone. Yahoo is part of the censorship problem. What a joke.
Retail shorts can cover tonight. BIG SHORTS will cover tomorrow. New 52 week high will print tomorrow. It will be fast and furious.
"Who will start the class action lawsuit against Jack & Twtr for putting political preference before company value? Looks like his decision has cost share holders about 10 Billion of value in 1 week, with worse to come. Worst part is that now antitrust lawsuits and section 230 immunity will be going away, opening the door to thousands of law suits. I think I am out!"

Twitter is continuing in a downward spiral as the charts show it breaking down on the charts with currently no bottom in site until you get to 39.43 which would represent the 200 day moving average. If it continues downward from there it would be ugly to say the least and would like fall to 29.43 area.
"Regardless of politics, why would a company remove an account that brings a vast amount of users and brings interaction to their platform? Twitter has been on it's way out as a platform for a while and frankly, if I was an advertiser, I would avoid it."

Divide and conquer the dems motto Freedom of speech is a right and should not be controlled by the left.Twitter has decided to divide and fuel the fire it will not end good for Twitter or it’s stock holders. Very bad decision on Twitters part.
What was Twitter before Trump? Nothing. What will it be after Trump? Nothing. Why are you investing in a sinking ship?

"Today, I deleted my Twitter account, which I've had for 10 years. Cancelled Amazon Prime. Cancelled Youtube TV. Next I'm ditching AT&T for a better ISP service."
"In order to understand why $SNAP is trading where it's trading (valuation wise), we have to understand the story and the long-term picture. Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share."
Sold my 100 shares of square today based on principle. There are better places to put your money. Didn’t own Twitter or I would of sold that too! Down with Dorsey.

At this rate we won't have to worry about China or Russia for interference for meddling in our lives!"

"How are the 300 Twitter employees feeling this morning , you know the ones the newspapers said wrote a letter to Jack Dorsey demanding he shut the account down . Ancient history gave us The original 300, the ancient SPARTAN warriors of Greece who held off an invading army , modern history gives us 300 keyboard warriors who tanked their own company."
The Twitter supporters here realize that through this shareholders lawsuit settlement Dorsey had to give up all rights of control over the company right? Worst company of 2021 easily.
Gravity is a funny thing.
"Congrats to $TWTR management on the 'Hope and Change' targets! Well played pump.Of course they have been a publically traded company since Nov, 2013 (8 years) with a business model that has not brought them fame, fortune or riches.

5 dollar stock by the end of summer
Ouch! Down again and Monday doesn't look any better.
Twitter offends half of the USA and their stock price goes up. This making money off stocks is a very confusing proposition.
Btw. Sold. Made $26k. Thanks.No donation to Big-o-Lardo. Not a “Patriot’
Wait for the morning lull in about an hour. It will show no mercy as this stock plummets and NEVER recovers. Half the users are gone now. The advertisers will also walk away. Twitter has no business model.
"I don't know who would want to own this stock at these prices. Politics and free speech issues aside, they've made a bad business decision that they can't take back. It took them years to add those millions of users and lost them practically overnight."

TWTR was trading below $18/share when Trump won the Presidency in Nov 2016. Trump's usage of Twitter over his 4 years dramatically increased revenues and the stock price. Removing Trump will cost Twitter many followers and revenues. The stock price will parallel those reductions. Biden is just not that interesting and entertaining.
im measuring my whiteness.....1 thru 10....10
There also maybe a market for Jack to sell whats left of TWTR to IRAN! Since he like that leader!
You know what else isn't going to be forgiven? Your rent. In fact I jut raised it. Welcome back to the plantation wagie. No more avocados for you
I am surprised that anyone is going long at these prices because there is much more volume in PUT options vs. CALL options for TWTR.
Twitter is vicious savage vitriolic hatred of the left 24 hours a day.
"One thing the board is forgetting and this may get deleted again! Once Trump takes out Biden in the final round (next week), you can be sure section 230 will be destroyed and his executive order from 2018 will delist this #$%$ from the Nasdaq. Outside of everything else, this will be worth $0."
"No Parler. No problem let’s use twtr, google Ann and apple conversation board on yahoo finance.. lmao yahoo is another biased outlet"
"Deactivated my TWTR account. Not a real political person, but can't support a company that is. Also hard to imagine a social media company the size of Twitter in the COVID era that still can't make money. What happens when people are back to socializing in real life??"

if you believe in FREEDOM OF SPEECH then do the moral thing and sell big media tech stocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pre-market = green. End of day = Very red.
You can be a communist in a free country but you can never be free in a communist country.

I shorted at 48.50 yesterday looking to cover for a quick trade. Think I will hold on a bitlonger since I see it falling to low 40s in the short term.
Deleted my twitter account this morning. The communists can have it. I really won't miss it.
"Selective enforcement of the “rules” is censorship, plain and simple, and this is what Twitter does all the time to elevate leftist viewpoints while suppressing conservative ones."
Shorting Twitter is my new stimulus package!
You can buy twitter for $100 in 2021. How much is that a share.
Buy more Twitter￼ shares? Yes! Only to Short. It’s the beginning of the end for Twitter here is Twitter stock in 2021￼
"Just me, but I'd rather see Melania (T)rump Stormy Daniels on a $20 bill than Tubman.Multiple thumbs down if you agree! Bigly!!!(T"
"Short Twitter. No profits, no social morality, suppressing freedom of speech, close your accounts!!"
I think Twitter is in trouble in the short term. I am shorting the heck out of this stock and Monday should be a blood bath. Couldn't happened to a better CEO.
"Janet Yellen was recently paid more than $800,000 in *speaking fees* by Citadel."
This is speculation on speculation. Twitter lost 1.15 Billion last year. All of the interesting personalities and topics are censored.
"My sister thinks that socialism is great, and says everyone should be equal. Then she goes out and purchases a new Lexus! My parents tell her that she won't be able to purchase new cars like a Lexus if marxism being spewed by MSNBC, CNN, Huffington Post, NYT, Yahoo, Google, AOC, Bernie, Nancy, Schumer, and other leftists prevail. She told them that they don't know what they're talking about and have been watching too much Fox news. She proceeded to say all it takes is for the top 1% to pay their fair share and for corporations to give all of their earnings to their employees and the government. Unbelievable! MSNBC is all her and her husband watch 24/7."
I sold all mine at twitter and close my account with twitter and I am asking all to do the same. This is for Our freedom and constitution.
"Once again, Twitter is leading the communications field. Twitter is now monitoring all tweets and will “fact check” everything and make appropriate comments. I think the telephone companies need to follow this excellent example. They simply monitor your telephone conversation and then interrupt your call with appropriate “fact checking”."
Material Event has happened. Twitter could be a in violation of SEC laws unless it files an 8K detailing massive USER loss.
"I realy like clubhouse ftom Elon Musk, much more better then twitter"
"Obviously retailers will be selling on Monday. Question is will institutions do so as well? If they do and large hedge players short it, then it could be dooms day for Twitter."
Big Twatter day coming..
"William Gates doesn’t get a pass. Flying around with his billionaire toys doesn’t make him exempt from the climate crisis. Gates claims he’s a good billionaire, who wants to offset his climate damage. He does it by making more money investing in companies that promise to remove his carbon. This cyclical BS doesn’t work. Gates can drive or walk, has money enough to be Virtual anywhere, and with a pandemic raging, doesn’t NEED to be anywhere. Take a break, Gates, and stop messing it up for the rest of us."
"Twitter reached user saturation nearly 10 years ago. It's simply not a very useful platform for anyone beyond socialites, celebrities, and politicians. Did you ever notice how most of the tweets that the average person hears about are typically embedded in more mainstream news sources? Smoke and mirrors have been the only thing that's been keeping the numbers looking good. IMO it's useless technology that's been struggling for a reason to exist for years."
"From Florida's Great Govenor The act, should it pass muster in the state House and Senate, would force tech platforms to disclose what data they have on Floridians to those users and delete that information if requested. Earlier this month, DeSantis unveiled a proposal cracking down on social media companies themselves. This legislation is the sequel.The first round of legislation would enact a $100,000 daily fine for any platform found to be de-platforming political figures and candidates for office."
Can’t stand by a company that doesn’t value our right to free speech. Deleted and sell
"Hundreds of rep investors will dump Twitter stock at the opening, this is a coordinated action. I advice everyone to setup stop loss orders."
Another billion gone from market cap! oooof
$55 next week...bank on it
We are short selling this today and laughing all the way to the bank!
Twitter finally free!!!!
"Why are my posts being deleted? Something very, very evil is going on."
Twitter is going to $100 because Jim Cramer is the biggest pumper and has a $100 target price! Buy now!!
I shorted TWTR because I saw this happening. Took a nice profit this morning. Going to donate it to the NRA and Parler.
https://www.opindia.com/2021/01/uganda-bans-twitter-and-facebook-over-election-interference-allegations/amp/
I wonder when the panic selling starts
Can't wait for the law suits. You get what you deserve. Enter the abyss where you belong. ACLU even says you are wrong!
Deleted FB account
Put country ahead of censorship sell your Twitter now!!!!
"Tyson knows what to do with a dead bird. If they can't sell it retail, they make cat food out of it."
Finally stopped?
Twitter above 60 after earning and its still cheap
The swamp is still draining.
Ouch! Twiddleeedy is down again.
I hope the stock tanks!
Those holding on still believe this was a fair E L E C T I O N
OK now going to test 45... sticking with 25 by summer
This what the market thinks of the Retrumplicans thinking they could sink Twtr pps....
"Watch for the big institutional holders to start lowering their positions, they have secured a nice profit and won't let it slip to far before taking some profits."
"More room to fly.....flying higher to $100 plus level,,, no stopping"
"Retrumplicans really brought this down.....lol. BTW, bought in at $44.05. Thanks for the great entry!! Jack Dorsey for, ""Man of the year""!"
CANCEL TWITTER ACCOUNT NOW - Do Not Support Communism!
Illusion if you think this is going to stay up. Democrats and Republicans and conservatives will be running from Twitter. This is just the beginning.
Head and Shoulders still forming nicely on the 1 yr. buy your puts out past Feb 9th. losing half its user base worldwide will be detrimental.
At twitter headquarters
"Ironic how it's stuck at the ""45"" level...Coincidence? I think not."
"Happy to see the dems creating a crisis at the border...no worries, the libs are still on track for turning every dem city into an open public toilet replete with public defecation and urination....lots of litter, noise and added crime for a bonus....the tent people will resent the competition....new higher taxes and fees will be needed to keep the show going...but the smell, that added bouquet will be on the house...."
Add my parler @DropShock I deleted twitter and will follow back any proud patriot that follows me.
At what percentage of a loss will institutions start dumping ?Right now we are at 20% .Keep up the good work vanguard is starting to worry
That’s a nice double top on the 6m & 1m chart￼. But I’m sure that doesn’t mean anything LOL￼.
"There is no protection for children on Twitter. I had to ban my 13 year old son from using Twitter, after he began to get naked pictures of men sent as dm's. It said clearly on his account that he was 13 and wanted to chat with other kids who played Playstation games. Twitter is a playground for pedo's."
"If you are not out of Twitter yet, GET OUT ASAP! Twitter is going down!!!"
It will be fun watching big tech lose in the stock market tomorrow.
"In other news, it was reported today that Rudy Giuliani has now joined the ranks of the ""Public Transit Vehicle Undercarriage Inspectors"" union as a labor representative for the PTVUIU. He has also landed a gig as the hair-model for a major shoe-polish manufacturer. Bigly. Believe me. MAGA - Mulvaney and Giuliani AWOL"
"Since Dorsey was under oath at the time, it is now confirmed that he committed perjury, which is a serious crime. Will he ever be held accountable?"
American Patriots support the right of free enterprises in the free market to enforce their terms of service. USA #1.
Never catch a falling knife.
I am thinking a good strategy may be to wait until this sock gets to $100 as the prophet Cramer said it would and then short it. What do y'all think?
Another Monday and another short to put in. I think overall market is going to have a bad week and twitter is poised to lead the way down.
"Like always, when the qrtly report was good, the market will turn red! When is this thread going to stop for twtr! "
MAGA impeached TWTR and the market has now convicted TWTR. Shorts will now feed off the carcass. Sad some longs were just caught in the middle.
That was short lived. Down she goes...
Fund managers at vanguard and others are having meetings on how far they will let Twitter go backwards before they bail ! Most were in before 20.00 When this happens look out
Newly published SEC filings showing Insider selling has started...Jumping ship!
"Pre-order Twtr feb 8 earning reports to 62 to 65.. Twtr hit 57 after hrs,now"
"So Jack, can you explain to me why my 13 year old son gets DM's on Twitter from middle-aged men asking him to do things, and from others showing naked pictures of women? It says clearly on his account that he is a young teenager and only interested in gaming."
Twitter is the best social medi- app. Twitter made me rich. I invested in Twitter after I saw Jack Dorsey on TV. He inspired me and converted me from conservative to liberal. His ideology is above wisdom. Now I’m in full support of censorship and cancel culture. Lets defend democracy and put decency back in the White House by crushing the deplorable right. Orange man is bad.
Been off Twitter for months and am much better for it . . .looking back I realize It added nothing positive in my life and that their are better ways to get actual factual information!
if you wanna see what's in store for Twitter look at MOMO 1 year chart. that's if your lucky.
Me making fun of 45 Fanboys: “Uh...let’s short Twitter” 
Nice slice off the top of the Twitter entertainment forum. I guess futures  is a good thing. Critical race theory and all.
"Jackoff on video: ""we gonna purge millions of accounts from twitter""bulls: ""buy the dip"""
"NEGATIVE SUBSCRIBER Growth, TANKING Revenues, Terrible ER, Terrible Guidance, but $TWTR BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!"
"It's one thing to block far-right fanatics and extremists. However, blocking an entire political party is unacceptable. This was way over the line. I enjoyed having political discussions/debates with my Conservative and liberal counterparts. I will be deleting my Twitter and FB due to this as well..."
Nice Close  Who's buying this Turd tomorrow?
Hope you trumpers are sending him donations.... because I hear he's thinking of filing for bankruptcy for the 7th time
"Control-Joe says we can have a BBQ in July...Americans are wayyy ahead of you Joe,wake up! He tried to take credit for ""Operation Warp Speed"", sorry Joe, we know what is warped ...get the lobotomy now."
How is this reckless company not in the 30s yet?
Get out before the next earnings. This is going to tank.
Jack Dorsey bears a striking resemblance to Grigori Rasputin wouldn't you say?
"SDNY and MC meeting for the 8th time, that isn't good for the Former Guy"
The collapse will soon intensify. Twitter will be $15 in a year.
Can someone tell me a time in history where the good guys were the ones who were censoring free speech and banning/ destroying books ?
The Republican Party is eating itself alive! Meanwhile Twitter sets new highs almost daily!
Too much Risk here. Reward favoring the Short side
Losing half your customers in a weekend and more following the exodus will destroy twit. Clearly investors were the last thing they cared about. On Twit the plan is a massive short attack. You won’t recover bc you’ve lost the base. It’s over. Watch for gab to go public. Free speech and own platform: TV Social media payment processing search engine...designing phones. All detached from goog amazon and apple. It’s over
Cancel Twitter and follow the same people on Parler. It’s back.
"I sold my stock in twitter today, about 25,000 was doing well with it, but so not happy with their censorship!!!!"
"Does anyone know how to join the coming class action lawsuits against TWTR? Every lawyer in America must be frothing at the mouth ready to file class actions and anti trust lawsuits against APPL, TWTR, AMXN, and GOOG right now. The Board of Directors need to step in and take action on behalf of the shareholders being bent over becasue of management's actions. AMZN has clearly demonstrated they are a monopoly or belong to a group of monopolies in the cloud & infrastructure hosting arena. Not to mention, they are definitely in breach of contract with Parler. There is no way IN HELL AMZN will be able to justify breaking their Parler contract without allowing Parler to first offload to another provider. Can you imagine the lawsuit coming AMXN's way on this? And for what? Just to pound their liberal drum a little louder?"
"twitter just permanently deleted 1 very powerful account, then 12 million twitters followed suit by deleting 12 millions twitter accountsouch ! fair trade to me...."
"Take your money (whats left) and buy real hard assets. Banks, Oil. Protect yourself from tech asset bubble."
This is known as biting the hand that feeds you...10 a share by summer
Next stop $70
who sold at 44.50 because of the trump ban?
short squeeze?
Best guess is that 20-40 million accounts will be canceled this week by the users. Shares are also being sold. No knows just how low the price will drop over the next 90 days.
Twitter is going the way of MySpace.
"It beat earnings (by a marginal amount), growth seems verry halted if you look at the numbers."
We need to compile a list of companies advertising on Twitter and boycott them. The use of our dollars is one of the strongest weapon we have in the struggle against the Left. Please post info about Twitter's advertisers if you have it. Thank you.
The sad thing is there is more free speech on these message boards than Twitter.
Sell today! This will drop fast! Not a joke
Project Veritas has recordings of the CEO of Twitter discussing the censorship of the Titan .. they say that there are multiple people within Twitter who have volunteered to denounce their boss !!
"The thing is, Twitter and Facebook are selling your PERSONAL INFORMATION to anyone who will give them money. Aren't you afraid? I know I am. That's where the data leaks begin, that's where the fraud begins, that's where someone steals your id. Just who has your information now? You don't know. No one does. Twitter and Facebook sold you."
"The left has hit the airways talking about ""hate speech"" and how they want to ban it.. Well I hate to break it to them, but ""Hate Speech"" is 100% constitutional."
Warren Buffett: 'Never bet against America'
"Not even at $34, pricy and still boycotting!"
How can I recover Monday morning. I don’t think my asking price will hold as this drops. Any helpful suggestions are appreciated.
its setting up perfectly for a lunchtime selloff to 43.
new unwritten hiring policy - if candidate has either facebook or twitter account then disqualified - bammmm
"I’m going to start doing the opposite! This market is not for traditional investors. Bad news equals pump the stock, good news is dump. Fml"
This company is toast. Save yourself
"I wouldn't purchase a share of twtr for 20.00 a share, But that's just me. Free speech is a right according to the left wing as long as it isn't a Conservative making the speech. GLTA"
no earnings just magic beans
"First of all, i don't buy shares of companies with negative earnings.second of all, I despise twitter, & uberkapo dorseymay the pain for twitter go on, and on, and on!"
"TWTR $FB $AAPL all eyes next week...ACRX mentioned as 1 of 2 stocks that could TRIPLE, presentation viewed by 53,000 viewers in 4 days:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxEFekPUuqU&feature=youtu.be"
People remembering the last time they made money in Twitter!!!!!
Senator Ted Cruz challenged the results in Arizona which was his duty.
"Once the ""boycott Twitter advertsers"" movement gains traction Twitter will fall to single digits."
Look like people will move to Reddit..this stock will be down when ER coming.. Good luck..My predict around $35.00 or lower..Short will win.
The P A R L E R APP is working again!!!
notice how Brenda just talked about how cathy woods is shorting the stocks that she is telling you to buy? She knows because that is exactly what she does. when she tell you to buy she shorts..... when she tells you overbought and sell she is buying....
Put options are going to absolutely explode tomorrow morning after the Project Veritas video appears and knocks Jackoff into the abyss
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS...THE PARTY'S OVER......ALL GOOD THINGS MUST END........ADIOS BWAAAAAAH!!!
Where's Ronjon? Still buying a sinking ship?? LMAO!
TWTR HAS BECOME THE THE POSTER CHILD OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DICTATOR CONTROL OF THE WEB. MOST DICTATORS HISTORY TELLS US FALL AND FAIL! $25 BT EOD EASY
"I cancelled my $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts."
Will Twitter block the thousands of leftists planning to show up at state capitals to fight?
Hope Twitter and Facebook go out of business. I have use Twitter in 5 years and I have cancelled my Facebook account. They will never influence me again
Nice to see the TWTR board evolving into a communication method for patriots. Please share this and let's send TWTR reeling to the single digits (where this turd belongs). Short at will. Eff ewe Jack.
Keep up the good work Shorts 
This is a easy short! No brainer 38.00 easy
I just canceled my Twitter account. Feels good
"Come on, we all know you're heading back to the red zone, stop playing"
yum....i love being white.....yes sir
"How are things working out in Democratic controlled California? Can't go to a restaurant & even eat 6' apart ""outdoors"" Forget working out at a gym... Need a haircut, go under ground to find a place, etc. TWTR & $FB & the DEMS want us to conform or else..."
Good news now is that you don't need to repeal Section 230 as Twtr just imploded.
Call your brokers first thing tomorrow morning to sell these toxic companies in your 401K and retirement portfolios!!
FB and TWTR are being banned from Internet Provider..... hahaha
"74,000,000 Americans and many more are disgusted by Twitter's outrageous attempt to to censor the Conservative voice in America. Twitter will pay for it. The FCC will be on their back and watch Twitter shares plummet."
Why does Twitter and Facebook hate their customers? $FB $TWTR
"Going down! Back down to Penny stockland, maybe finish at a solid nickel stock price by the time it's over!"
"This is the biggest piece of k-rap earnings transcript I have ever read. The future DOES NOT look very bright. Here is the brokerage house collusion again to pump. Unreal. Comments welcome.“Do you see a net profit in 2021?” - No questions“How will competition affect your brand and user base in 2021?” – No questions“Costs will be rising 25% and revenue 30% according to your statement, you just reported a loss, ergo will it still be a loss in 2021?”What a set-up. This is like living in a fantasy financial world. https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/10/twitter-inc-twtr-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/"
"There will be a massive offloading of Twitter shares today. The fall in share price will be faster than we've seen all week. Project Veritas has spilled the beans on Dorsey, and you can bet the institutions want out asap, while they can still save some of their investment. Get out people. It's going to hurt anyone caught up in this. If they won't buy your limit, make it a market sell, because that's probably how fast this is going to drop. When that happens the little man has no chance unless he gets out at market price."
Any idea if Rudy Giuliani is going to sue Deutsche Bank for cutting Trump off from loans and the PGA for cancelling their golf tournaments at his courses?
"TWTR stayed alive because D.T used it, now looks like a dying dinosaur"
"Jobless claims up, inflation up, Treasury yields up ... indexes still near all-time highs. Anyone remember 2000???"
This company is responsible for all the chaos and division of people in the US. Don't forget this .
Ouch! Down again..................
George Orwell was right
"I wish Twitter would go broke. I can't stand Jack Dorsey! democrats seem to love the word ""collusion"" but see no issues with Twitter, Facebook, Google and Amazon colluding to take down anyone they want for any reason which always includes ""taking out competition"". But the democrats see no issue with that. I don't think any of those four companies would have the balls to do it to Joe Biden or any democratic affiliation. The democrats will always protect those four. ALWAYS!"
"Wow my last post is not here. It must have been censored, only thing I can think of is I mentioned the T man in it. This is getting pretty crazy."
imagine elon musk stepped in to create a new twitter
I thought for sure CPAC would have Jake Chansley and Bigo Barnett speaking at the convention.
Looks like conservative states are getting together on sensorship. Congressman from Florida said to ban big tech. I
"“This isn't Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It's the United States Congress,"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said in May as he railed against several Democrats who attended a launch after signing a letter saying their absence was due to the public-health crisis.The list of Republicans who wrote letters appointing a proxy include speakers at CPAC on Friday, such as Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Greg Steube, R-Fla.; Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C.; and Ted Budd, R-N.C. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., who is speaking Saturday at the conference, signed onto a lawsuit against proxy voting."
Being almost dead from poison is not an excuse to miss parole. 3 years.. Be glad you live here even though the left is trying to silence the right.
Sell sell sell! Use your data and info for profiting! Where is your privacy?? Playing politics?? Save America without Twitter and Facebook!! 
"Mississippi U.S. senator, Roger Vicker, lauding the covid latest relief bill passage to his constituents because it helps the ailing restaurant industry and yet voted against it. What a swell guy!!"
Gab and Telegram traffic continues to explode higher. They are taking a big bite out of someone. I wonder who that could be.
45 barely got 2% GDP growth with massive tax cuts and significant increases in government spending in support of 45's socialism.
Twitter is done for. I’m out.
Looks like it's losing the will to fight... we might see a big red candle before today is done.
This will be the mother of all short plays come Monday morning.
twitter Made In china
Nothing will be lost when twitter fails itself. Everyone will gain a new understanding.
This stock is my favorite short period price target zero
"Jake Chansley aka the Qanon Shaman and Bigo Barnett are rumored to be guest speakers at Trumps send off tomorrow. Don't miss it ""live"" on Fox News tomorrow."
I thought goldman put 112 price target?? Going wrong way!!
Is this the Twitter board?
"Kamala Harris should be impeached after she takes office for helping violent rioters, looters, and arsonists in Minneapolis post bail so that could potentially commit additional acts of violent destruction. On June 1, 2020 Senator Harris tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota. We must use the same political weapons that is being used by the Left. Immediately, contact your House Representative to get the impeachment ball rolling. Just don't post on a messaging board, but take action TODAY."
Time for all people Dems and Repubs to cancel twitter. Clearly Twitter will silence any of us.Good bye Twitter... the end
sold my puts yesterday for a mild gain. Good timing on my part. This is to manipulated for my liking.
Problem is Twitter....I haven't heard a single left-wing person or group complain about being censored on your app.
"Out of 718 businesses in downtown Portland, only 430 are (sorta) still open--most by appointment. 200 nights of riots in Portland. People beat and shot. Same with Seattle. California, police shot while just patrolling. Where where all these companies like Twitter and Facebook during all of this? In fact, they let calls for violence against Pence to trend after they kicked off a bunch of people."
"I Have Been One If Not The Biggest Bull On TWTR For 4 Years! But, Our Beautiful Bird Has Lots Of Gaps Guys! And You All Know How I Feel About Gaps! Fill Those Gaps Baby;)"
Another good day in the National Socialist Twitter Workers' Party.
Our Beautiful Bird Is Very Over Bought! But Refuses To Go Down;) And For Everyone Who Needs To Know I Do Not Short Shock!
Twitter started the run too late and chose the wrong time. Hence the shareholder lawsuit to silence him. The purchase of the recent company was a reach to a peg of a drowning company and they overpaid extremely because it was from desperation.
Every time I make a comment on this board it gets deleted. Google Mark Levin and listen to his comments on the Capitol riot.
US and Russia are battling for European gas business. Thanks Joe I think you picked the winner.
I can't believe this is happening in America. I dumped Twitter and Facebook this morning.
" I didn't expect it comes this soon - it is the beginning of many changes for human beings, out of a traditional way in high-tech. Soon new high tech will dominant and replace the current. "
The fight is between good and (evil-Twitter).
Is it communism to ban the person inciting violence against our own capital???
bye bye twtr
Too woke - gone broke
BYE BYE TWITTER. Kicking the main source of traffic from your money losing platform was not smart... that's what happens when you have a leftist ideologue as CEO
"Alternatives to hyper-inflated stocks like Twitter: stocks that are actually profitable, have reasonable P/E ratios and are paying dividends.Real estate, which is booming due to low interest rates.Precious metals like gold and silver.Corporate and municipal bondsCommodity futures- there are many different ones to choose.Being long in hyper-inflated securities is very risky business and is NOT the only game in town.Hedge funds will be driving down the price of stocks like Twitter via massive shorting, much like they did to unprofitable companies like Gamestop, Express, AMC Entertainment, Bed, Bath and Beyond. A short squeeze opportunity in stocks like Twitter will only occur after a massive amount of shorting has occurred, which is in the distance future. Twitter's current short position is a very modest 2.7%.Good all to all."
"Twitter Bans Over 70,000 QAnon Accounts in Conspiracy Crackdownyou the man Dorsey"
“QMarjory QGreene falsely states...” will be one of the most common tweets and headlines until Coup crew founding member QMarj resigns or is impeached.
Brenda I would like to know where u think TWTR is going today?
"Good long term hold, especially when paid Twitter launches"
if twitter wasnt actually worried about other platforms like parler and Gab then it wouldnt be working so hard to take down parler etc. The fact is theyre very worried and their next earnings will show that. Numbers wont lie.
"Yesterday in the last three minutes of trading 1.4 million shares were traded in a .65 to .40 cent trading range, here is the kicker the shares being booked was 2000 to 35,000 that amount of shares hitting the close in such large blocks and pretty much at the bid would indicate that one or more FUNDS are off loading to whoever is willing to buy them.Mom and Pop retail investors are done and won't be back anytime soon."
"No Dotard, no problem! TWTR long and strong."
She says to follow Parler......
"j, another DNC mouth breather following yep, ""John"""
My favorite short. Thanks twitter.
Dorsey's anti free speech agenda is more important to him than his concern for stakeholders......this isn't going to go unnoticed...this will continue to tank....
3 million new accounts in last 12 days. Guess which service? Hint: it ain’t Twitter.
markets crashing
"What happens when parlor is back and, on top of it, Gab's phone with its independent operating system (that allows Parler) starts to sell like hot cakes."
"So all that money that was handed to BLM, where is it? Is it true that it found its way into the bank accounts of the three RACIST MARXIST hags who run that organization. We should be told. Seriously Jack, what happened to that $10 Million of SHARE-HOLDERS MONEY you gave them?"
"The left wingers seem to enjoy knocking on the doors of conservatives and interrupting their private lives with ""peaceful"" protests. Why does the right not reciprocate against the likes of Dorsey, Stacey Abrams, AOC, the entire squad, etc? Both sides are entitled to peaceful protests, right?"
"In one of Ronald Reagan's interviews he said, and I quote. ""If facism ever comes to America it will come in the form of Liberalism"". And it has arrived exactly as Reagan predicted."
"Today if $TWTR finishes at or near it's low and tomorrow being a non-descript Friday, it could be very, very brutal. No one will want to hold over the weekend.Could it touch the 59s tomorrow at close?"
Gab is running smoothly and added 3 million new subscribers in 12 days. Plus they value and respect free speech. These folks aren't coming back TWTR.
"suppression, in any form, is not a winning business model for a communication tool."
Robert E Lee birthday. Market closed.
"I have no idea what hedge fund or individual is holding this up/pumping this up. BUT, it seems artificial. I hope the SEC is looking."
Will close below 70 today.
Take your gains today and run ... In Germany is way down.
The decision may backfire on Twitter if half the country decides not to use its platform.
"$TWTR $AAPL $FB $GOOG $AMZNAll Americans, left and right should be very worried about the censorship of differing opinions. These companies need to see that it’s not ok. Short ThemSell ThemDo Not Support Them"
"As a consumer, I'm against monopolistic Big Tech banding together because they are controlling my freedom of thoughts and Individual Rights."
Let it fall!!!!! I never in my life wished so bad that billionaires would lose billions. I don't bother them why they gotta bother me and take my Parler away?
Imagine buying a company that is working to destroy your liberties
Hope it goes to 0
If f___ing SNAP worth almost 100B market cap then TWTR should be at least 150B market cap.
Time to short now
NASDAQ is even and TWTR is up over 3.5%!! Does anyone REALLY believe this BS?!
and here I thought the twitter communists would at least get one day in the green.
"I bet Dorsey was so relieved at the end of the day from holding TWTR up all day, throwing so much money at it so it wouldn't go below $45. He's thinking, I got time, it's a 3 days weekend."
"If you are on the RMS Twitter, I recommend abandoning ship. This ship is sinking, india is banning Twitter inside the county which is the 3rd largest user of Twitter. Insiders are selling off. Jack Dorsey is currently incoherent, what ever ""REEEEEEE"" means."
I don't think Dorsey cares about the share holders one bit
So is how does Dorsey plan to spin his new user count next earnings? Maybe he is hoping for chinese customers.
"My prediction is always very conservative! When I say 37 by the end of next week, it’ll turn out to be 33 or below! LOL"
"Hey longs, get out of this now. It's going to collapse."
Where's that bounce Jack worshipers?
Yahoo the pioneer of social media. Rise of the Phoenix?
SELL everything that is associated with suppression of free speech unless you appreciate communist control going forward
Twatter had this coming for months. Sure glad Dorkey stepped up his game the last few weeks by taking his mask off to reveal the CCP-sponsored censorship. Making money is too easy on the backs of these Demonrat sympathizers.
Red by opening
Twitter a growth company with no growth.
Would you let someone who looks like this near your children?
The BIG Drop is coming
Where's Cancún Cruz today? Where's Moscow Mitch today? Where's Rudy? Where's Rotgut Ron Johnson?

"Dictator Joe, 35 executive orders...what happened to democracy? Exactly."
Can't wait to see my short position quadruple in remaining weeks
TWTR's multiple is priced for double digit growth. Where is that going to come from?
Dow up because of oil. NASDAQ down because it is overvalued...for the moment...especially Twister.
This company should be put out of business once and for all.
This is SO MUCH fun. You just KNOW there will be hard data soon about how many MILLIONS of users Jackoff has lost for Twitter! Look out below....!!!
"The CEO of Twitter chose the side that locked down D.C. with over 40,000 armed military personnel. Only the extremely wealthy and “elite” were welcome. Once you begin to understand that you begin to understand what’s happening in the U.S."
who sold at my target price for today $65-$67??? feel smart for once in your life...
"It would be quite ironic if people are TWEETING ""dump TWTR"" on the Twitter platform!"
Just deleted the App from my phone as well. Felt really good. Wish I could have done that 20x.

Twatter just brought back the tech bubble.
Give it all back. It must be Friday
"Jack Dorsey didn't expect his stock value to decline. He has 76% of shares held by Institutions, they must be concerned. Mark Zuckerbergk has sold $650M of his FB shares in the past few months. And Tim Cook CEO of Apple just gave an interview. He never does interviews. It looks like they are all trying to do damage control. If these shares keep dropping, don't be surprised by possible management changes."
"Let’s all just sat that Twitter was a good idea, but it has issues. So lets agree to ditch Twitter and make a new website called Chirper ... because all twitter is .., is a website nothing more!"
Bad news coming for Twitter afterhours today. Dump before it's too late.
Hold those short positions ! Last 8 trading days down and together we can sink this !Institutions are hedging there bets

"HUD, I must admit two things right up front:- I’ve never posted on this TWTR before, and- I was duly impressed with your perspective!!If I may, I would like to add just one additional consideration:Someday (hopefully soon) America will realize that these platforms are just 21st Century Utilities and need to be regulated as such.Think not - Standard Oil, AT&T, the Baby Bells, Microsoft et al were viewed as abusive to the public interest. BUT EVEN MORE RELEVANT the Public Utilities cannot turn you off for your political views - why shouldn’t these fundamental consumer services not be subject to similar oversight? And, oh by the way, Al Gore invented the internet upon which they have built their businesses!!"
I'm do not support the Viking invasion of the Capitol...but taking away freedom of speech is WRONG! Short this to Zero...
Twitter getting crushed in AHs. Will probably open up down 10% on Monday. Losing half your subs will crush any revenue model you had.
"Get woke, go broke."
"CONVERTIBLE BONDShare price of $130.03 in 5 years which is 67.5% above yesterday's closing price. Folks, that AIN'T VERY GOOD EXPECTED SHARE PRICE GROWTH.

"Twitter DOES NOT make a profit. They are run at a loss, and yet can virtue signal and hand away $10 Million of the shareholders cash."
My friend called this exactly. He made his profits in the premarket and got out before the market opened.
My dog just defecated on a liberal newspaper with Jack Dorsey and Nancy Pelosi on the same page. A Double-whammy.
Only dems can rationalize that paid member growth slippage and increasing expenses are not as important as a slight increase in revenue. Twitter will fade away because of its one sided views and disrespect of the only president that really worked for all of the people. Someday a great black leader is going to day that and it will open the eyes of many.
Please some group or organization with the ability start a website listing all firms that advertise on FB and Twitter so believers in free speech can know whose products to boycott.
no profits and destroying growth. run for the exits.

PUBLIC ain't BUYING and neither are other FUNDS.Case in point look at the TOP INSTITUTIONAL OR FUND OWNERSHIP, KEYBANK IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND."
Sad day in America when the liberal/socialist big tech media companies shut down free speech! And at the same time limit any other social media company/s (like Parlor) with the ability to compete in the market! Now we as Americans get to see what it's like in other socialist countries. And the saddest thing is how young Americans think socialism is OK. That's what you get when the majority of liberal /socialist teachers and professors are brainwashing them in the schools.
Wow looks like its going to be an ugly week for TWTR next week

Because santy clause is your mom and dad, and a lump of coal implies he's real and thought you were bad that year. But the TRUTH is underwear and t-shirts, and a prickly wool sweater for school.

You might be a far left liberal if you believed that Dorsey banning the POTUS would be good for the SP...here’s your sign.
"SUPPORT Freedom Of Speech, your birth-right.Delete Twitter, FB, Amazon, Google and Apple accounts."
Going down after earnings!
"lol idk how people are selling this fast enough. do you realize that even if you are bullish on this stock, technicals are going to drive it lower, especially with entire market going down as it is. ETF selling will compound it towards end of the day + TWTR already at technical overbought level with RSI above 70."
Nothing beats watching you liberal twits loose your money on Twitter. Institutions are going to run real soon . It’s all about profit and how many subjects Twitter has
"I don't invest in the stock, but was a user for a decade. I'm from Canada, but had to delete the app. It was a seriously toxic place man. I flipped to conservative from liberal, generally mind my own business, and was only tweeting support and replies on conservative politician's posts and the hate I was getting was insane. Ended up deleting after some rando figured out where I worked and lived."
You don't buy shares in a company which has just had $5 Billion wiped out of its value in a single day. Instead you short the shid out of that company...
"We should cherish FREEDOM OF SPEECH"" not to suppress it. This is what Dorsey is doing. He should fire employees who are advocating it. Twitter is publicly traded company. The shareholders are in charge not employees."
"I went to Mexico. That's ""One"" time I got out of the cold unlike my constituents. Next week I will go to Mar a Lago to see my orange Master. That's ""Two"" times I am getting out of the cold unlike my constituents."
Investors REALLY need to view what Jack just said about suppressing a lot more free speech. I think that’s what you call DD.
My hearts are with you shareholders. You don't deserve what is about to happen to you investors. Twitter's censorship (communism) doesn't sit well with people in the free world. Twitter is gonna be gone so the sooner you bail the better off you'll be. Sorry but wake up.... stay free.
"If anybody from twtr views this forum, let Jack know that shorts are going to bring the pain on Monday."

This is just the beginning. Buy
your freedom to speak is on the chopping block....make no mistake
"Time to dump Twitter stock. Half the nation is no longer allowed to post there. They just purged 4,000 of my conservative followers, with more to come. James Woods lost 173,000. Twitter is just a refrigerator magnet for the Democrat Party."
When you ban the President of the United States from your site that is meant to promote freedom of speech. On the grounds that he exercised his right to freedom of speech . ...
"Game over, folks! It's coming from Italy! Run or you will regreat!"
"Twitter's chart is as bearish as can be, SELL"
GAB get 40 millions peoples in 3days
I will never hire a Twitter employee
"Yagoo shadow banning is happening.... posts are not appearing, but when you click on your own feed the post appears"
I use to (total PAST TENSE) go to Twitter looking to buy stuff (NOT!). Is that what you mean Jack in the new direction? Business direction makes little sense.
Just a little breather today before TWTR resumes the slow and steady march to takeout the all-time high at 69. MAGA is doomed...lol!
"Obvious warning: If $TWTR finished at the low of the day or a hair different, watch out for Thursday and ESPECIALLY FRIDAY EOD. It could be multiple dollars ugly."
"The future is here, people with traditional values need to unite. There will come a time when we need to sacrifice. Most importantly we need a place/website for those who have a voice become censored and there will be many. We seen this on the news articles, and we will see it on this format soon. Many of you younger Conservatives/people with US traditional values are way smarter than me, but I hope you get the general idea and stand your ground!"

perfect spot for short
I just cancelled my amazon prime and I can't be the only one. I have not had a bank account since the financial scam of 2008 as I use a credit union. I will go door to door to tell people to not go to twitter. I will campaign on the internet. I will get people off twitter. I may even pay them a small sum to close accounts
No more freedom speech
Something about twitter's outrageous business success gets sad people who believe insane conspiracy theories all worked up.
Not one good reason to get in or stay in...I'm out.
Going down faster than Monica on Bubba Clinton.
"For anyone who doesn't think trump is important to twitter. Look at the stock chart and compare it to when he took office in 2017. In 2016 is when he was campaigning seriously. Now having looked at the chart, #$%$ do you think is going to happen now that Trump is banned? Trump is most likely going to move to an alternate platform and there is going to be mass exodus from the site. Get out before you lose your money!"
"Who else is on board with the fact Bydoon doesn't remain in office until the 2022 mid-terms? There's a soft coup shaping up to move the dementia patient out and install the radical left wing nut Hairazz as POTUS. Anybody who was paying attention realized this was the plan from the beginning. Rig the election so the cognitive mess wins, let him play POTUS for a little while then convince him he's really not capable of executing his duties and that he needs to step aside. Watch for it. It's in the works and will happen before November 2022."
Jack is buying his own stock. How can that last. Twitter will collapse. Down $5 today. Watch and see.

"Dorsey you work for the shareholders, not the democratic party."
DEMENTIA boy's economy sinking dooooowwwwwnnnnnn
"I’ve done tech longer than bat kid has demanded attention. Nobody measures accounts. Nobody counts accounts. Hotmail doesn’t count how many registered of half registered or verified or unverified accounts it has and Microsoft doesn’t report that number. The numbers they do care about are Activity, page views, retweets, ad views, ad clicks. And looking at the group on 1/6? Not only are they freeloaders, they never click on Twitter ads, and never buy anything advertised. That’s why it’s 0 value keeping them and their impressions and their risky activities. Getting a sweet jasmine or mypillowbiter ad over at defunct GRUparler wasn’t so special."
twitter will be less than myspace by the end of the year.
Tweet this Twitter stock going down fast here haha 
T W T R reminds me of the reason my parents left CUBAIt's based on an idea that never works! NEVER!

"Hello $70, bye bye ppl who think Twitter is controlling FOS"
who bought yesterday when I said under 50 was on sale?
"Twitter has entered into a binding agreement to settle the shareholder derivative lawsuits that accused CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives of misleading shareholders about Twitter’s growth, while selling their own personal stock.The lawsuits were first filed in October 2019 by shareholder Jack Porter, and accused Dorsey and his colleagues of misrepresenting the growth of Twitter’s (TWTR) user base and artificially inflating the share price.Porter accused the defendants of exploiting their positions and selling “their personal stock holdings for hundreds of millions of dollars in insider profits” while possessing material, non-public information.The proposed settlement absolves Dorsey and his co-accused of any wrongdoing without any liability attributed to them or the company.As part of the agreement, Twitter will implement certain corporate governance adjustments and will pay for certain administrative costs. The company will not be required to make any additional payments.In addition, under the terms of the settlement, Twitter’s insurers will pay $38 million to the company that will be used for general corporate purposes. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion initiated a Hold rating on TWTR last week and set his price target at $45. This implies downside potential of around 6% from current levels."
WOW ! Big accounts leaving Twitter. More people closing accounts ! Here comes the 30's folks. Twitter is losing billions of dollars everyday. And the CEO still thinks he did the right thing. What a DA !!!
This stock will be 10 dollars a share by June 1st.And Jack will be fired by July 1
Will be $20 by end of year if they keep censoring half the country.
"You can't buy your way out of your mismanagement, you know, Jack? You do know this, right??"

Maybe the Reddit people are at work?
"No amount of Yahoo! censoring on this message board can prop up TWTR but for so long. I'm excited about this trade! So much so, I doubled down early this morning. And TWTR is the queen of censorship, with rich uncles Jeff Z and Jeff B on the right and left. It may work for the Washington Post and Facebook, but Twitter needs open and honest tweeting to succeed. There's no emotional attachment to the platform. I, along with millions of others, simply and summarily deactivated my account. Others were de-platformed or censored or put on some kind of Dorsey-invented probation. The whole thing is a joke and will be a laughingstock at some point down the line in history!"
This company never coming back.
Users are hemorrhaging. I have 2 locked accounts that prevent me from accessing 'settings' to deactivate them. This artificially inflates the number of actual active users.

Congrats shorts
Why would anyone own this stock with the Cliff it is heading for?
"Sell Twitter now, enemy to the free speech!"
TWTR CEO reminds me oh how #$%$ Germany was started. I laugh everyday how their CEO takes action to censor people and fails to see how he is following the same path as so many evil dictators did before him only with out the same technology. Anyone who works there seems to be ok with this so what does that tell you about their company. Amazing.

"Twitter's mission statement:The mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve – and do not detract from – a free and global conversation.Everyone? Really? Everyone except for the POTUS and others associated with him?Notice that Twitter's claim that business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve - and do not detract from - a free and global conversation.So they have just thrown their business model out of the window.Since this company doesn't turn a profit, spends money all kinds of ways, doesn't even really have a mission statement that they are abiding by, why not just dump it?Why do you think there is anything here moving forward?"

"Tech: 1.9T printed. New bond offerings and taxes. Yields have been rising and will rise even more rapidly now.

"Wow, down again! millions of accounts being cancelled by Freedom Loving Americans."
Twitter still not admitting that the Hunter Biden laptop story was accurate and there are still tons of active posts about the farcical 'Russian Collusion' narrative they pushed for 4 years .
"I just read that the NY Post has instructed it's journalists to not use CNN, MSNBC, WaPro and NYT as primary sources. This is very good. I think there will be more to follow their lead. Basically, the NY Post is censoring CNN, ,MSNBC, etc. as primary sources. YES!!!!!"

Don't listen to the bulls. They're going to be unloading shares on Monday and they need to someone to buy their position to hold the bag. Get out while you can. Parler is likely to get millions of new accounts by the time trading opens on Monday.
Ouch! Down 3% again today.
A permanent suspension to a president regardless of political outlook is a bearish indicator.

Lesson for Twitter here: Companies should not get involved in politics or religion. I thought that was Business 101!

"Communists and fascists ban free speech and books their ideologies do not mesh with.

Twitter's five day chart is a beautiful thing!
"Twitter lost over 1.1B in the trailing 12 months. They made money in two of the last 4 quarters. They're at their peak and the stock price reflects future growth, not a good combination.At the very best (from their perspective), the FANG companies have now opened up a huge demand for competing products. That goes for Amazon and Facebook, and to a lesser extent Google and Apple. They all just created tens of millions (perhaps more) who will jump ship to any halfway decent competing products. Gab, Telegram, Rumble all surging. There is a huge opportunity for prepared investors here to fill the void."

"Communists think free speech they do not agree with should be banned. If it is hurtful, it should be banned. If it makes someone feel bad, it should be banned. If it is counter to the media narrative, it should be banned. If THEY consider it a lie, it should be banned (in that case, shouldn't every member of Congress be banned?).The word LIBERTY is a completely foreign concept. Their nurturing thru the socialist free public education system has made them ignorant to history, the Constitution of the United States and why there are truly God given rights."
The man didn't even campaign from the basement. The media campaigned for him.
"Anyone who owns TWTR or is considering buying should reflect on what they have become. We so many instances where they ban people for only having a differing viewpoint whereas others who can brag about not paying their taxes, fleeing from a government search and arrest warrant, athletes who baselessly whitewash an entire race of people who have done excellent work for charities as racists, it all shows the lack of positive leadership a company should have and the employees who are promoting this type of behavior to promote negative subculture factions in any country. This platform of propaganda and control must end and it prevents me from ever considering buy this stock. TWTR must evolve into a better company that is promoting all social media without bias. They are a shallow company with little objectivity."
"It's no wonder that HP, and Tesla have moved to Texas in the past months. More are coming. The exodus from Commiefornia is a reality."

"A while back I saw an article trying to estimate the value of Trump to TWTR. This was 4 years ago when the stock was $15. They had Trump at $2 Billion. Add 4 years of growth because of Trump being President, and all the other conservative personalities (who were also deleted, it was NOT only Trump), and all their followers, and replies, retweets, and retweeted retweets, so on and so on. Then look at the profitability of the company, or rather the lack of it. This will very likely swing them to a loss, and if angry conservatives start boycotting advertisers, this could be extremely damaging. This isnt some spineless advertiser caving because of one or 2 angry liberals, this is half the country. While there may be damage tomorrow, the real damage will come over the next few quarters. Neither Trump, nor his 88.7 million followers are ever coming back. Ever. This is a permanent, self inflicted injury by someone with a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders. This will very likely be the largest shareholder lawsuit action history."
will we see 60 today?
Does anyone really see Twitter as a stock to own long term? Seems like a goner to me.
Cancel those that cancel.

"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration. Give it to them."
Angela Merkel just condemned TWTR. Germany knows a thing or two because they did a thing or two...Pay attention America!

Going with the Samsung Galaxy (don't know what model yet). At least I know they will have the latest Snapdragon chipset from QCOM which is the best by far in the industry. It's going to be a little of a learning curve since I never used anything but iPhones, but I refuse to support in any way a company that censors people. It is up to us to make these companies understand this is not China or a banana republic dictatorship."

Twitter stock is going nowhere. It's at the same price it was 5 years ago.
The best way to “teach” a company is through consumer and shareholder’s decisions. Twitter is learning the lesson.
selling Facebook tomorrow. I will not support suppression of free speech there either.
Wow GAB has picked up Millions of New Users in the last few days!
Liberals actually think Dorsey cares about them! 
Wow. 5 minutes here and it already dropped $1. It's uncanny.
TWTR Short sellers are American Heros.
the smartest thing you can do is buy and hold this through earns...

Twitter is my best performing stock in 2021. I picked up some shares in early January 2021 when it was at $45/share. Goldman and other firms made price target upgrades on Twitter recently.
this is going to be 3 digits and people can't stop it.
Twitter and it's future...
"This stock has to trade on the financial fundamentals and not on political opinion. Right now, there are a lot of amateurs trading this stock on their political opinion and they are going to feel the effects of gravity soon."
Selling begets more selling.
No surprise it's big institutions that are keeping the share price up
"When you see proof of Zuckerberg and his orders of the child hormone from kids murdered for ritual and 'medical' purposes, then a list of horrifics who took such treatments, eventually it becomes impossible to hide the facts."

"LMAO. My biggest short ever yesterday at $74.5 has already made me a fortune. I'll invite everybody for celebration when this crashes further. This anti-American, anti-Christian company should have no right to be existing in America. USA is still 80% Christian."
Take your money and run. Sell.
I am realy annoyed that my stop Loss got triggered last afternoon.
I’m making a genuine plea to all people with a modicum of common sense. Please deactivate your accounts and sell any stock you have in this miserable company with its outrageous and despicable Management.
"NO celebrities, NO sport figures, NO Left Wing Politicians were banned from their accounts during the BLM Riots. Any questions??? I hope these two stock go to ZERO $0.00"

"I wonder if shareholders can sue the corporate officers for becoming involved in politics in a way that DESTROYS the company? Can investors sue? If so, twitter will be locked up in the courts for the next 10 years. I have deleted 2 twitter accounts and my facebook."
No Stopping Our Beautiful Blue Bird Baby!
"Continue buying twtr today. Shorts are starting to cover!Twtr, the #1 media company!"

Look at that volume!!! Huge institutional dumping taking place...
"I think they are going to park this birdy at Jacky Dussey's favorite position with his boylet, 69."
Sell this stock. Save freedom
Coming soon 90$
"I was suspended for life years ago because of a negative Hillary comment but they wont allow me to deactivate my account ""because I'm suspended"". In short, Jack can count my account when selling ads, even though I can't use it."
Just saw the video of Dorsey (On Tucker Carlson's video) stating he is planning to use Twitter to censor other people also!!! he is NOT American!!! scary!!!
Be careful dip buyers
"Shrinking accounts, shrinking add rev., same overhead, increasing losses followed by a reverse split. Yep, institutions pulling out."
SNAP is trading at 30x sales. Pins about 25. TWTR about 13. Still trading at a significant discount to its peers. Going HIGHER!
"My Twitter account is frozen because I am a conservative. Millions are also frozen.Twitter will not allow any of us to close our accounts. We all moved to GAB and other platforms yet Twitter keeps our frozen accounts 'open' (although we cannot tweet, comment, change our profile or even cancel our account) to make it appear they still have that many active users.They are faking the amount of users by holding these petrified account as 'open.The company is a fraud and the stock price will plummet far further once the true number of lost users is revealed.Sell."
Mutual funds that hold Twitter will not be getting that monthly paycheck contribution. Long term Bearish
since everybody shorting $TWTR I might as well short it. plus what $TWTR did was kinda messed up.
"We should be happy that, for now, Chairman Xiden hasn't nominated Caitlyn Jenner for the dollar bill."
Just heard on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that Twitter has just cancelled Senators Graham and Graham. Twitter is doubling down on their attack on free speech.
I’m getting rock hard just thinking about this stock going down and down. Dorsey is a poor excuse for a man.
Ha! Me and my buddy are drinking beer in the garden and laughing our heads off.
You can't do communism and expect to have capitalism. This stock is finished.
Twitter is going down quick... Big tech has gotten too big
I feel that Germany now a has more of a better grasp on freedom of speech than we do.
"Lol, This is why libtards think freedom of speech is a bad thing."
"Between half of US citizens deleting TWTR, countries banning TWTR, TWTR's high debt, Dorsey depleting company's cash to prop up share price, People aggressively shorting TWTR, as well as lawsuits filed against TWTR, don't be surprise if TWTR goes to single digit by next month."
"One thing I learned from this episode : the greatest threat to America and its freedoms is not China, Iran or North Korea but Big Tech. They are now the enemy of the majority of Americans, who should take a concerted effort to destroy them."
How is this company market cap worth more than twitter $twtr and pinterest $pins market cap combines?
When Twitter locks you out they don't allow you to deactivate your account. This artificially inflates the actual number of user count so as not to alarm advertisers and affect the Twitter stock price. NOT WORKING!
"After reading all the comments here, I feel like I just got outta a triple K meeting"
CEO getting sued for giving SQ data on TWTR users. SQ made millions. Did shareholders vote to approve when he gave BLM $10 Million? How much did he give to shareholders? BOD just looks the other way? Not investing my money. He needs to choose SQ or TWTR.
The little blue bird flew over a skeet range today and got tragically blown out of the sky. Funeral to be held on the day earnings are released.
$65 tomorrow.
That was quick.....deleted...
"Sale your stock, thousands dumping Twitter now."
"Wonder how David Dennison and John Barron will weasel out of that pesky non-residence deal that was signed over Mar-a-Lago. I don't think that either one of them ever signed a legal document that they adhered to, ever. Bigly.Sux that Deutsche Bank dropped them and that the PGA cancelled their high-paying tournaments.https://news.yahoo.com/members-quitting-mar-lago-because-104047480.html"
This stock will be $500 in a week..Perfect business model..Where else can you get a platform for free speech?? I know there is the minor flaw or you have to say what Twitter wants you to say..And if you don't they lock your account but hey they cornered in not so free speech
Imagine investing in a stock where the owner is a Feminine pencil neck geek who wears a little nose ring. Embarrassing Embarrassing
Parler HQ!
This is the most un American company out there. It is now toxic and I’m glad I no longer own it.

"2 years ago street tramp AOC declared ""we only have 12 years left"". so by my calculations 10 left to go. i just might see the planet swallow us all up. awesome..love it"
Sorry for all those that thought this morning was the bottom. Hold your hats :)
Fell below the 100 day. more pain tomorrow
Many upgrades for Twitter at $65 dollars target price and TD keeps reaffirming to hold this stock. I will be a believe only if this stock reaches $60 first.
Could someone please tell me who got banned from Twitter & Facebook during all the BLM Riots?
Twitter: Over promise and fail to deliver much of anything. Read the Motely Fool write-up. Puffery and fluffery. Will 'this time' me different? 15 year-old company ...
"If you think the bottom of this stock is in, consider you permanently deleted 50% of your base and from the time that was announced the stock is down less than 10%. Think NBA."
Dorsey will be jailed very soon. Leaked video from Satan himself detailing his true intent for the platform. Government not happy!
"Folks, Twitter has carpet bombed their platform. Literally a train wreck over there! Here's a first hand account from a Twitter orphan (I deactivated my acct): ""I'm still on there. It's like a ghost town. Everyday, my followers are getting cut or leaving. I'm an extremely small account anyways - 1700 followers. Now, only 1001. I'm only still there to support the stragglers. :)"""
This is in a short squeeze on the run up too earnings and post....
"If you are planing a trip to Washington, DC ,I would reconsider..The DC city council just voted to reduce their police department by 25% and release from prison convicted felons who served at least 10 years of their sentence....What could possibly go wrong...."
No people need TWTR but TWTR needs people. When you leave it you will find that you don't need it to live.
"Who in their right mind would pay a monthly fee for this ? Nobody. That's why this anti-social, social media platform will end up predominantly infested with democrat bottom feeders."
Who's on conference call now? :)
"Look at what Germany, India, England, Mexico are saying about twitter. Twitter is on a downward spiral because Jack Dorsey runs his companies based on Ideology not principles. The Securities and Exchange Commission should come down on him for defrauding investors."
Just wait until they don't meet numbers and the subscriber base is cut in half. Remember --- it won't be just Americans leaving Twitter.
There are better places to make money
I love it when a big company gets woke and then goes broke.
How many believe that the White House riot was staged by the Democrats please all 83 million don’t respond at the same time yahoo’s service will shut down￼
Hopefully TWTR's Stock Price doesn't Completely COLLAPSE in the last 35 minutes because that would be bad
"Hold the line today, it will fly high next week"
"Ha! Infowars right now, is showing the Dorsey video and taking him apart. Go watch it on Infowars."
if it gets bellow 1 dollar it will get delisted
"Twitter is self-destructing day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute. Couldn't happen to a more deserving organization."
30% of all Dems thought the election was stolen. Google it. What does that tell you.
"I can’t push my idea enough to make it matter unfortunately, but some of you will get it. We have entered an incredibly bad repeat of history led by a 78 year old lifetime politician that has learned how to lie well above all other things in his life."
Wonder how much shareholders cash Dorsey will give to BLM/Antifa in 2021? Is it any suprise that Twitter can't make a bean?
TWTR is still under valued. Eventually it will be in 100s IA
Twitter account deactivated. Check.
Hey guys shorting the stock is important. But closing all social media accountS will insure that these communist will be shut down. also buy from USA.
44.11 @ close.
We are loading up on TWTR here. I guess the Parler crew will be heading to FB next. 
sell the peaks
Jack Dorsey was working remotely on a private island in French Polynesia frequented by celebrities who are avoiding the paparazzi when the decision was made to ban Trumps account. Disconnect from his company may be an understatement.
Yesterday January 12 TWTR lost 5 billion in market capital. India looks appears to be taking a stand against Twitter the whole company is going to be banned from the whole country. Which has a population of over 1 billion.Question is how many people from india have a Twitter account?
Just a reminder to everyone that Twitter is yet another MONEY LOSING BUSINESS in this gigantic massive stock market bubble
TWITTER = 330 million users. Subtract the 75 million that will leave....thats a 20% drop in users.
"need an ETF to short liberal companies. Social media, woke sports, hollywierd etc etc etc"
Let me get this right. Twitter just got rid of the biggest draw on it's platform and just told all his followers to go F'm selves? Puts are going to be very expensive for this stock on Monday.
"I’m done with Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google. Time to breakup the monopolies!"
Let's test free speech again. Joe...Donald came up with operation warp speed. Don't try to take credit. Second time posting.
thanks for the gains 
"Everything is going by the book. Twitter announced its acquisition of newsletter platform Revue two days ago, but the company has already begun to integrate the product. Another reason that Dorsey is moving on from the Trumplikins flashback..."
One of the few times that it's ethical to short a company
Well you had your chance to get out lefty’s . You were warned! @Jack don’t care he’s busy sticking needles in his arm ! 
The dump on retail will be epic Possibly a 15% day..There is no back tracking apologies to make up what has been done...
Bye Jack
"If people can't abide by terms of service, you boot them off swiftly and unsentimentally. That's just good business."
I hope foreign governments now treat Twitter like China does. All credibility lost.
"look at options today, oh boy"
Twitter no more...
I read that Bloomberg is done pumping Twiddle.
"Twitter locking accounts so that people cant log in to delete them.""We arent losing that many accounts, really we promise"" in 3, 2, 1..."
200 contracts on puts! expiration date is 2022. next earnings is gonna be brutal. I still don't have answers how twitter makes earnings. users are leaving by margins on a daily basis
"It’s not just in the US...TWTR is censoring accounts un every country. They are not a symbol of free speech any more. They have chosen to defend lefties ideas everywhere...and will loose 50% of clients everywhere, as simple as that."
"Hi Brenda, did I told everybody that this is going into $100s, YES it is destiny!!!!! Congratulation to all my fellow Twitterian"
I am out folks. Liquidated my Twitter long position. Any tine a company begins to Qualify their customer base it is never optimal for the bottom line. As a wise man once said to me: If you are all in agreement with me I do not need all of you! Long live Freedom of Speech!
"Boycotting of businesses that advertise on Twitter, FB and Google by 75 million Constitution loving Americans will drive Twotter out of business and FB to double digits."
I laugh seeing this stock getting propped up before earnings and its obvious. this will come down to $20 and ill have my puts ready
"Back at $20 today, dude trust me"
"I dumped twitter, cancelled my Amazon Prime account, will never buy another Iphone. STICK IT big tech... totalitarians."
Does anyone want to pay a transaction tax? Might be coming.
Millions flee TWTR to go to GAB where they aren't censored & ghost banned.
I like Twitter:
"A business model dictated by Nancy Pelosi. Great plan, Jack."
Buy NAKD stock support Heidi Klum
So many people fleeing to Parler I cant even sign up for my free speech ...tried several times the last two days....... I wonder when they are going to go public....!!!
"Just saw Jack on the veritas videos. Just unloaded 2000k shares. Not much but if every free thinking shareholder does this, they'll be in a world of hurt. Short position at this point."
"Blue lives matter!! Unless its Capital blue lives. You can then gouge eyes, hit with hockey sticks and fire extinguishers."
I'm selling my 1000 shares on Monday morning. TWTR crossed the line and attacked our constitutional rights yesterday. Peace out.
This will be bankrupt.. My Puts and Shorts since monday $250K. Going to $30
boycott Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl's stores they're getting into politics for the Democrats
Any company that treats its users and shareholders like this should be sold!
"So, I cancelled a week ago now. Honestly, I feel better. It was a good move."
"I quit Twitter 2 days ago after joining in 2013. I will eventually short both TWTR & Square stock. Not right away, but be patient, wait until you see the numbers lost during their earnings call, will be in the tens of millions. Bottom line is Twitter is really just a cesspool of people spewing their meaningless views. It’s trash "
Insider selling of SQ last week. Interesting...
"Don't overlook this. The deactivation of all the highest profile conservative accounts will also result in a severe reduction of progressive counterpoint reactions. It's a severe traffic killer and a double whammy against TWTR.The stock may get propped up in the short term, but paraphrasing Titanic, ""The ship will sink. It is a mathematical certainty."""
I Sure Hope All My Friends Listened To Me When i Said This Was Way Over Bought! I Hate To See Anybody Especially My Friends Lose Money! Our Beautiful Bird Is Going Down To At Least The Mid $60's And May Fall A Little Farther If The Market Corrects!

Sell Twitter stock now! The ship is sinking!!!!!!
Let's see how many followers Sleepy Joe gets with his new Twatter account. LOL
"Without knowing anything about the company, a person should sell their stocks of Dorsey's companies based solely on his current appearance."
"BUYERS BEWARE: You are not investing in a business that aims to be profitable for shareholders. You are investing in a political organization whose price depends solely on the actions of their far-left activist of a CEO. If you own shares, get out while you can. Dorsey is acting against shareholder interests."
Turns out the Capitol invaders were Antifa. No surprise really. They've been doing that level of terrorism for the past year. The CIA is clearly recruiting Antifa.
well #twitter has now purged and baned #qanon and heavy followers of qanon. over 1/2 million users permanently band
Many of my posts are being deleted. Read reply to this post.
"I paid my house taxes and hoa at the weekend, using the profits I got from SHORTING Twitter."

"so apparently they want to cancel Luke Skywalker now too! "" it’s being claimed that there is “immense pressure” from within the company to ditch the Luke Skywalker and Baby Yoda storyline from all future plans."" ""Well, the unnamed author says that despite Hamill being very politically progressive, unnamed but apparently influential Lucasfilm employees associate Luke Skywalker with “conservatism, the patriarchy, male-dominated narrative, etc.” and want nothing to do with him."""
"The next base of support for TWTR is at $24, the price that Elliot Management and Silver Lake bought it for last March. The question is whether or not Elliot Management and Silver Lake want to sell their stake or if they want to make organization changes in upper management. The political animus within TWTR's rank and file employees in hurting their ability to reverse their losses on the balance sheet."
Twitter is going to be the official news source at the re-education camps. They wil have a monopoly on the education of the forced labor for enlightenment.
Where does Dorsey live? Anyone have an address?
this is doing incredibly well. unfortunately the market has been extremely bearish. for future reference im marking february as bearish. instead of sell in may and go away im marking my calendars to sell in january. will only buy in october and november. will never hold anything past january this market is extremely hostile towards retail investors.
Sell Twitter! oryour money!
Twitter is the laughing stock of the high-tech world.
"Hey Twitter investors, Dorsey doesn’t care about you, he’s made his money! Better sell quick before it’s too late!"
90% of fund managers will not let a stock that gave them 100% go backwards more than 25%We are close look out below when they start selling
"Takes a few days, the largest institutional owners have to meet and agree to get out of tweetsville. Then the deluge."
Never trust a 'business' run by a guy with a ring through his nose.
"Delete your twitter account. Do not invest in a company that loses money, and is losing market share. Dump this stock!"
"As a conservative I cannot buy shares in a company who hand money to organisations like BLM and Antifa. That's where your profits went. No one asked you, but you funded BLM and Antifa burning down the cities."
My prediction. 6-months and this will be on the Pink Sheets trading for 30c.
Going to $30 in near future
Where have all the shorts gone? Where have all the good times gone? LMAO
"Q: How do you build-up a 15 year old legacy platform by alientating 30% of your users, stiffling free speech and selling convertible bonds that dilute shareholder value?Easy!!! Press releases and 'bought analyst' price upgrades!BTW, how are things going over at Goldman? Three big departures in the last few days, look it up."
Glad I don’t use Twitter anymore.
Who would pay these prices. when the books say it's worth 1/5 of the current PPS
twtr ceo pumps his stock last week; now he's dumping his stock this week...
"Dropped under the First Support Point, the stop-losses are being taken out."
"TWTR down, NASDAQ up. Strong sell"
Watch out TWTR. Telegram increased almost 1 billion user in 2 weeks.
A very large sign to a professional trader that a company is going down is that I’m able to flip it consistently for a profit. Also one must add the concept that many big tech are leaving California wit informed decisions while Dorsey conducts his business from a private island. The warning signs are all here for long term investors. Day traders like myself however are enjoying it very much. I highly recommend not investing in Twitter long term.
"I would urge all patriotic Americans, all Turnip U alumni and all past contributors to the Turnip Foundation (which supported Children’s Cancer Centres and Disabled Veterans, but was unfortunately shut down) to give generously to Mar-a-lLago to support the foreign workers, property maintenance and legal costs."
"As soon as the bell ring, better yet in pre-market, just break the 45 mark, then it will slide to 40 by mid afternoon, let this corrupt/evil/wicked/ entity fall and crumble to ZERO. It will take some time, but I think we can get it to 30 by Friday. Sweet."

Twitter suspends Khamenei
The EXODUS has only just begun.
"On Feb. 3,2014- Twitter closed at 54.91Nearly 7 years later- Feb. 1, 2021- Twitter closed at 52.66 During that 7 year period, Twitter was down 3.09%., and yet during the exact period of time the DOW went from 15,794 to 30,212, for a rise of 91.29%. Relatively speaking, Twitter has been a terrible investment, and I believe it will continue be a lousy investment for the following facts: negative earnings, no dividend, recent reduction in users, a lawsuit for child sexual was filed last week, and additional child porn lawsuits are expected to be filed in the near future.People on the Left who have invested in Twitter for political reasons , not financial/business ones, I believe will come to regret it."

"My day keeps getting better. Twitter down $6 bucks so far to $45.50. Way to go @Jack!Get Woke, Go Broke! Can I hear $40?"
Market watch raised the target so wallstreet can get out. The volume is way up. The price is holding. They want to sell their shares to someone that doesn't know any better.

Dorsey can’t keep his fingers in the dam much longer! Crashing very soon!
Who will Rasputin ban next? This insane CEO will bankrupt Twitter...
Will bite back Twtr at 40. Lately bagged 122 k after 6 years of misery but missed another 80 k after selling. I was only 2 weeks of lightning speed but nothing to say but regrets and I had a few.
$BTC investment made by $TWTR turns out to be a very bad move - already lost millions of dollars imo.
Run before it bankrupt
haha now its going the right way! people have finally opened eyes!
big suits trying to prop it up. wont work
How come twitter never removed any Black Lives Matter posts that organized many many riots that resulted in 29 deaths and 4 billion in damage?

"Twitter is very unpopular amongst teenagers. Now the company is self sabotaging itself, will lose a million+ active users this year. RIP future growth"

AI is being rolled out everywhere. Banks love AI already. It will replace all kinds of repititive jobs. Even at Mickey Dee's. It will be IBM Watson taking your order at the drive through. The burger will be made by machines inside. The only employee is the person who keeps it working. So more layoff's are coming. Covid-19 was the excuse to lay people off btw. Oh and I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI seen it all coming. It's here. Your jobs are gone.
Not impressed by Twitter’s CEO trying to answer questions from Cruz.

"Right now on the news, they are talking about a lawsuit against TWTR that was just filed where they allowed porn videos of a 13 year to be posted on their website. When he complained , they said ""it didn't violate their policies"" That is an 8 or 9 figure , gold plated lawsuit right there."

The Exodus of big Tech. GAB is running slow because of a million new users a day. Telegram just broke 500 million users. IF conservatives can't win a rigged Election they can win through power of the purse and choosing platforms who believe in free speech

I wouldn’t fall for this trap. This is how fake the stock market is. Something is coming and I believe this will come down like a house of cards

Twatter is providing the model for all brownshirt wannabe organizations. Jack Dorsey has enlisted in Goebbels's army.

"When TWTR drops to $ 10, D.T will buy it, and J.D will become a janitor"
Yet more proof that Democrat led majority cannot get the job done.
Good report
America land of the caged by tech? Short short short
"Apple, Amazon and Twitter are acting like the 5 families of the tech world. They should be charged with the Rico Act, its' a coordinated hit."
"How did Twitter's stock price ascend to where it is today considering the facts it has a negative P/E ratio, and does not pay a dividend? The answer is large revenue growth projections. Recent actions made by the CEO have greatly diminished Twitter's ability to grow their revenue in the foreseeable future, coupled this with the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab, looming class action lawsuits from disgruntled stockholders, and the recent revelation of its association with child sex abuse, the big players on Wall Street are going to give Twitter's stock price a crew cut in the not to distance future."
I don't want to live in a world where Big News and Big Tech dictate my values and action.
"Delete Twitter, FB, Amazon, Google and Apple account. SUPPORT Freedom Of Speech, your birth right."

"If MLK had a dream & he tweeted it, that too would be censored."
SOVIET RUSSIA WOULD EMBRACE the behavior of TWITTER AMAZON FACEBOOK... They need to suffer severe consequences..
So does Dorsey know that he lost half his assets? Users are his assets. But he is still stuck with high debt and only half of his assets operating. Timber!
Amazon AWS taking down Parler tomorrow. That's their new reality. Ours is all of these socialists/marxist/globalist/DeepState/MSM/SocialMedia cabal is about to feel the truth on their crimes.

A 20% haircut seems too reasonable for the corruption
looks like shorters and their political agenda didn't work today finished green today with new price target 60.00
"Twitter way undervalued and still not fully understood by the masses, but that is changing , the value isnt in the useless status updates or even what celebrities have to say, its an agregator of human analyzed, curated, and created data, news, and more. Those subscription features are going to make sense. You may think im crazy but im pretty sure, it will be $150 within 6 months."
I bought 500 contracts of puts after earnings. Earnings is gonna be brutal.
This is essentially a lotto play now but the potential upside is extremely less than the potential downside.
Nobody is interested in state run media
"Market is up, and this isn't. Going to fall today."
Shareholders sue Twitter for losing all of their money on purpose.
This company already losing money in business. It will be sold to Chinese company.
Another green day for TWTR...thank you MAGA!
"From Bloomberg---""Despite the recent gains, Wall Street remains mixed on Twitter’s longer-term prospects. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 12 firms recommend buying the stock, compared with 24 that have a neutral view and five that have a bearish rating.

"TWTR = SELL !!! Send this down !!! They are trying a head fake !!! Short all you can.

Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can !!!!!!"
No matter the politics Twitter is Toast!
"All in all, not a bad day. BECAUSE I SHORTED TWTR early this morning... The one thing Jack and his type cannot handle is getting embarrassed on public forums. You know he must be on the phone with Yahoo right now trying to shut us down! But it's not happening, lol!"

"How come the BLM ACTIVIST who was arrested for his part in the Capitol Invasion. The same guy who egged on others to burn the place down. The same guy who egged on Ashley Babbitt and then filmed her being shot and dying. IS WALKING THE STREETS FREE AS A BIRD. He's CIA. Look at the pictures of him in paramilitary uniform with a semi-automatic rifle on his shoulder, and a holstered sidearm. It was a total set-up. The Boogaloos were caught on camera before the event saying they were there to cause to trouble and that they supported BLM. Work it out."

Sell this stock. Save our freedom
If it was the left... They wouldn't quit.. They'd be back protesting at the capitol building and the media would be supporting them ..
Oh no. 50% of America shutting accounts off.
"no matter what side of the fence you are on, the 1st amendment right cant be suppressed, might as well call us North Korea if you are going to do that, hows that 4 Billion dollar loss feeling this morning Jack ?"
Shorts are crying
The market is now an illusion. Propped up because those who control don't want it collapsing on their watch. Wait...wait....wait...and see what happens! Just saw a tape from a witness to the fact that Rosenstein created a dirty crimes division with......Shawn Henry.....Crowdstrike. So many horrific individuals tied to companies in the US.
i think twitter has lost 50 percent of their users who would never come back since people found non censoring alternative solution
"TENS OF MILLIONS OF USERS LEFT THIS COMPANY YET TWITTER STILL HOLDS THEIR ACCOUNTS RANSOME.I, like million of others, have a frozen account on Twitter which I can not close. Twitter won't let me.The majority of Twitter users are gone. The remaining accounts are no different than the Wells Fargo fake account scheme from a few years ago.The stock is a fraud and it's future is doomed.Good Luck."
GAB reports adding 1 million users a day. I've been on GAB for about a month it's a nice platform. running slow right now as they scramble.
"April 29th will be brutal. The question is, will reveals actually be truthful about suspended, deactivated and deleted accounts as well as 'bot accounts' and actual consumer interactions per day.It is a tall box they have put themselves in with HUGE expectations."
TWTR shareholders support cancel culture. Oblige them and cancel TWTR shares.
The Twitter has no freedom of speech so now I don’t use ever I hope it goes bellies up or at least stock tanks if go up its manipulation ( fake) 
Wouldn’t touch this with a 10ft pole

Generally I feel bad when people lose money but if you support Fascist Media it's well deserved
Twitter is the best social media investment stock in 2021
we are under naz! Germany control....
"Rudy Giuliani has now been instructed by his client to sue the My Pillow CEO due to his client being unable to sleep, Deutsche Bank for refusing to lend his client more money, the PGA for cancelling the tournaments booked at his client's properties, the Florida county that is making his client live up to his residence exclusion agreement, the Government for withdrawing the unbridled use of the coal-fueled Air Force One golf cart and the NRA for going bankrupt and being unable to give more money to the cause.Rudy will soon (in the next two weeks) reveal his evidence gleaned from the latest Lev Parnas-sponsored Ukraine Walkabout 2.0. A copy was given to Tucker Carlson, who unfortunately ""lost it in the mail"" on the same night that his dog ate his homework.Rudy Giuliani is hopeful that his client won't stiff him for all the successful legal work he conducted in more than 60 courts, including his submission to the Supreme Court (which sources have said Mr. Giuliani also intends to sue on behalf of his client).Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Making Attorneys Get Attorneys"
If the constitution is allowed to stand twitter will lose more than 100 million followers
"Around 10 am when the market settles down, this will really start to plunge."
"Facebook, Twitter are titanic MONOPOLIES with BILLIONS OF DOLLARS of PROFITS (DISPOSABLE INCOME) that State goverments and the US government need. Democrats can create a new social networking tax that starts at 20% and increases up to 90% for the social networking companies that are monopolies like FB and Twitter . The billions in taxes the state and local goverments collect will do alot of good for the people."
Currently $60.00An easy $40.00 move to $100.00
Earnings must be something extra
Buy Twtr Puts NOW.
I deleted my Twitter account - so should everyone else. Who actually uses twitter???? Who - except unemployed liberals - have time to read all those feeds. Twitter is proven now nothing more than an arm of the Democratic/liberal party.

"If you're a patriot, and you care about freedom of the press. then deactivate your Twitter account now. Facebook and Amazon must also cancelled.."
TWTR's earnings report will be very misleading. The disaster that#$%$ this company did not start til after the end of the quarter - so the quarter that's about to be announced will not show the disaster ahead. Hopefully some longs and TWTR supporters will double up once earnings are announced and then get smoked when the next quarter's earnings are announced. Single digits are inevitable. You were warned - again.
squeeze coming. if you trade stocks based on your politics you lose.applying standards is a good thing. you dont get to say water is dry. facts dont have two sides.see you at 57
GET OUT NOW! You’ll thank me in a few months.

Imagine owning stock in a social media company that lost billions of dollars in value because they censor people they don't agree with.
"Closed my personal and business twitter accounts and sold short 5,000 shares. America 1st!!!"
"Get ready for higher inflation, higher gasoline prices', a slowing economy, higher interest rates, a decease in real estate prices, massive debt, a weaker dollar and a stronger China...Enjoy the next 4 years they will make the Carter years look good...."
Short before the bell. Easy money.
Ouch! Now down 3% and dropping.
LOL I guess it’s poor business to alienate half of a country/client base eh?This action is going to be in business case studies for years!
An article from Seeking Alpha from 2 days ago said that at the end of Q3 TWTR had 187M users. Wanted to share this number because it will give us a baseline to see what percentage of the people delete their accounts.
"The Newsom recall effort has finally “almost” delivered enough signatures after almost a year. The primary driver is newsom’s pandemic policy. The Abbott recall only started this week, although it will only take 2 weeks to gather enough frozen squiggles for his recall."

"Shorted 5000 shares Friday. This stock will be in the $20's soon. If a boycott of the current advertisers starts, as I believe it will, the stock will go to single digits."
Sell everything tomorrow we’re in a bubble bubble licious so nutritious rat a licious gonna do dishes
Crazy Joe is gonna have a complete breakdown in his first month. Any bets?
"Cancelled my account yesterday and Facebook next. Now evaluating Amazon as well. These actions just propelled the big tech break up to a new level. They think they are invincible just like AT&T once was, Standard Oil, Western Union in the 1900's - the list goes on and on. I would love another phone company besides Apple and Google"
"Make your next laptop purchase a PC, not an Apple. We must fight the attackers of free speech with our dollars, as hey are the strongest weapons we have available to us."

He added that he anticipates the number of opened subject files ""to grow to the hundreds in the next coming weeks.""Of the 170 subject files that have been opened so far, Sherwin said the Justice Department has charged over 70 cases.

"To both liberal and conservative leaning individuals:""Pause and take a moment to reflect on the January 6th 'INSURRECTION'. Not a single firearms was brought by hundreds of thousands of people, with a good percentage being firearm owners and NRA members, to the Capitol. Would the demons (media, lying politicians, FBI) leading you astray? No need to argue, just think about the messages you have been 'told' and what logic tells you. What, it was the worst insurrection from a armed population EVER in THE HISTORY OF MANKIND or was it a FALSE FLAG event?"""
"Starting next quarter, will TWTR start reporting how many suspended accounts they have? Will these still be counted as active subs?"
"applying a policy that conflicts with US constitution is the best way to get crushed by the govt, not to mention losing the userbase. I am out... no longer interested in investing in a company that fundamentally conflicts with the freedom of speech & enforcing their own political policy..."
Twitter seems to be in a holding pattern but how long before the stock takes a nose dive! A month? Any more pronouncements from Jack Dorsey and Twitter is toast!
"Angela Merkel just denounced TWTR. Everyone should listen. Germany knows a thing or two, ‘cause they’ve done a thing or two..."
Green soon
"Jack Dorsey, maybe cute, he is no CEO.Jack should play more Golf and retire."
Another red day for Twitter! Straight men’s reaction everywhere.

"I've watched shorts kill stocks many times. It takes a concerted campaign but it's going to happen here. Never underestimate the power of the shorts.

"“We are focused on one account [@realDonaldTrump] right now but this is going to be MUCH BIGGER than just one account & it’s going to go on for much longer...""Goodbye @Jack"
Not good for Twitter . . . Uganda has blocked social media indefinitely Slowing but surely several countries around the world are taking action against Social Media companies. There is power in numbers against FB and TWTR
its really nice to see investors reject TWTR and Jack Dorsey. restores a tiny piece of the faith in humanity I still have left.
I will not use Twitter ever again
"Not trying to be a negative Nancy, I am glad this is up so high, but my goodness I get a bad gut feeling seeing the stock price so high.... it just seems like far to high of a run up far to quickly in a pandemic with a lot of these stock my gut feeling says some kind of huge correction is coming soon... who knows maybe the market will keep going into tulip territory but the run up the past year has been nothing short of incredible and I don't think its going to last forever."
How many other countries want to block twitter after the past year!
"The question is not how many TWTR accounts be closed, but how many people closed accounts and left themselves? 50 mil-70 mil?"
"The Left promotes a cultural of DEATH: dead babies- abortion, dead soldiers- endless foreign wars, dead birds including bald and golden eagles- wind turbines, and a ""dying"" economy via executive orders, onerous regulations and taxes."
"Patriots need to get serious about extricating GOOG from their daily lives. Yes, they have been more discreet, but they're demons in disguise. Through Youtube and Search, their level of censorship is greater and more damaging than TWTR. And, don't forget the harmful impacts GOOG has on privacy. Having said that, let's short more TWTR."
Laura Loomer just compared Jack Dorsey's censoring of Free Speech to the beginning of the Holocaust. This is why she wore a yellow star when she chained herself to Twitter's fence.
It will drop to 45 today. 45 for 45...
Fund managers unloading to bag holders. LOL
Kids in containers. BLM/AuntTeefUh running wild in the streets. Markets shedding hundreds of point daily. That's a clear example of why dementia patients shouldn't be awarded the presidency through massive fraud and theft.
Let the elites know what we do when the ban our free speech
"It's Friday, January 22, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts censor today??"
Back to 56 cent.
"If Nancy brings impeachment proceedings, this guarantees 2022 mid year to repubs. Go ahead Nancy, make our day"
"Twitter is a commi arm puppeteer "" short attack of EPIC levels is about to unveil"" Major fund manager known as the ""driller"""
"jack is hedging trying to hold the line with words, but the DEMs are going to let TWTR sink and use as an example for social media. Very little chart support until it hits $32- $29 range . Dont bet against the FEDs or Government"
"2 MILLION Americans are listening to Alex Jones right now. Think about that. Twitter, is nothing. You cannot shut us down Twitter. We find other ways to communicate."
Cannot wait to short this bag full of lies limiting free speech and such.
Why do people invest in companies that don't manufacture a product and only sell their users information to advertisers for profit?
"Many Americans, (silenced and intimidated by the left with their derogatory attack in conservatives), have been asking what they can do in these times to fight against the socialist agenda being pushed aggressively on our country...well, this is a start, dump this stock and all other big tech that’s trying to play god with our democracy...hit the radical elite where it hurts...their pockets $$$"
Under $45 today. Sell Sell Sell
Is there a vaccine to protect the public from the dreaded Twitter virus?
"According to Fox Business the cost of property damage from riots across the nation this summer will exceed 1 billion dollars.Axios states it will be between 1 and 2 billion dollars.The property damage done on Jan. 7th in Washington, D.C. will be much, much smaller.We should send the bill for the summer rioting to the DNC."
"If and when the market reverses course, Twitter will lead the pack of bears to winter hibernation. Right now, it seems that FB and AMZN are propping up TWTR. But it's turning into a lonely outpost over there. From a vibrant gold-rush bastion to an abandoned old ghost town..."
Bye Bye Twitter.
that's alot of Twitter shares!
"As much as I’d like for it to drop like a rock, I prefer a slow bleed. Then we move on to the next company. Rinse and repeat."
"If there was every a time for people to boycott traitorous companies this is it. Withholding our money and support is our greatest weapon, even more powerful than our vote. If more people could understand and exercise this we would have these companies and politicians on their knees. Our money is their life blood."
"Sold all my shares. The tech company is supposed to back freedom of speech, not blocking it."
"Soros is probably shorting TWTR, as far as he would be concerned, TWTR is just collateral damage, served its purpose."
shareholders are going to have a rock-solid case when the class action lawsuit hits Twitter. I'm pretty sure there was no disclosure that they were getting ready to become a political lobbying organization on behalf of the Democratic Party. not to mention the idea that they are working with the other Faang stocks to become a communist anti-free speech platform
Ha! This thing goes to $0. Parler is over capacity tonight. This is the end of Twitter.
This stock is being propped up by J Dorsey and his lefty club. They are buying shares on the side to make it seem more successful. Expect a significant fall in Q1 of 2021!
"The same pattern holds, flaccid pump attempt in premarket, then back to red. Didn’t manage even 1% green today."
Easiest short this year. Losing accounts caused by jack’s censorship. Love watching this crash to 20 or below.
I see this stock in the single digits in less than 6 months. If the only people allowed on Twitter are all in lock step in opinion and thought it will become extremely boring. What ever happened to the concept of diversity? This company has destroyed itself. I’m out tomorrow. Selling out of Apple and Facebook as well. We are not a Marxist country and companies that promote policies against freedom of speech should not be supported. This must stop.

Big tech will have a blood week come monday. Twitter FB Apple google ... drag down with it the nasdaq points. Even the left traders know it's coming. Massive exit coming.
"Reminder $TWTR folks. Jack Dorsey owns SQ. He is also CEO at $SQ so he is mismanaging two companies by being politically extreme and alienating businesses owners from using SQ’s inferior product. How much is he truly focusing on one let alone two companies when he has been censoring mainstream America and giving a forum to rioters, looters, arsonists and their associated organizations.$PYPL and other alternatives are the way to go. Don’t be known as “doing a Dorsey”. Self inflicting financial harm to yourself and worse others who have no say and mistakenly invested in $SQ not knowing.Go check out the public records, the vast majority of Dorsey’s holdings are with $SQ He has very little left by comparison in $TWTR.Sell and save yourself the grief."
Signed up for Parler earlier tonight and just deleted Twitter.

"I just can't see how #TWTR survives going forward. It's not as fun as SNAP, IG or TikTok and its not as interactive and comprehensive as Facebook. It's not as useful as texting, WhatsApp, or ZOOM. And it just removed its #1 content creator. It's basically the AskJeeves of social networks which makes sense since it came out before the iPhone."
Parler found a server. I personally like GAB but will support any social media that supports free speech and dissent of any kind. MAGA
"We can now see that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the entire Democratic Party are on a full scale assault of America. Not sure everyone understands just how radical this will be."

TWTR is infiltrated by CCP.BAN TWITTER.
Would love to see this thing gap down into the 44s next week just enough to trigger a bunch of stop losses. Anyone who bought this commie propaganda tool on the dip deserves to lose their money.
"The latest twitee prodject of the user getting paid money is explosive........

Democrats who have decried the building of a wall on the Southern Border and tried to stop it seem to be just cool with fencing keeping Americans out of their government as long as it protects Congress.

Do People understand that other countries are shutting down TWTR?
"Lock THEM Up! One of six men federally charged on suspicion of being involved in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov.

How long are you going to hold this garabge? Where exactly is the growth they are literally destroying their platform.
I guess Walmart will be getting my Amazon business now. Later AMZN.

Hope TWTR and other platforms that decided to become arms of the woke left mob will find their way to irrelevance.

It's clear that twitter is going down the echo chamber road.. The masses will not pay to join the Twitter Nazi party..

"Let's use some of our profits generated by shorting and buying puts on Twitter, to help low-income people who will be hit hard from rising prices for gasoline, electricity, and basic necessities like groceries caused by thoughtless executive orders."
That fencing around the Capital? It may not be going away anytime soon.
Twitter has transformed social media to social nightmare under the disguise of free speech and ended with censorship of people and political views that lead to loss of trust to company and its leaders. It also damage its business and investors have lost their trust as well. Only institutions still holding Twitter shares right now will soon face the pressure from their clients and exit their positions in kitchen sink next few days or weeks.
"Greg Abbott has already DEMANDED the return of the Texas national guard. It was an abuse of power to use them, and now that dementia Joe has used them, they are sleeping out in the cold."
Don't want to be the one holding the bag. World leaders are speaking out against Twitter. Better get out before the full on free fall.
Shudder to think where stock price will be when user metrics plunge negative
Why does the Ayatollah still have an active account?
"Since jack has shown how well his company can censor free speech, maybe the CCP will be interested in a version they can use to feed propaganda to their citizens?"
$TWTR I did not realize Jack Dorsey was also the CEO of $SQ - yikes.

Sell this stock quickly! Cut your losses...
"due to the recidivism rate, ie, users who deactivate yet return, TWTR believes users are too weak to resist. what do you have to say about that?"
free speech is gone
Don't believe any you read on the net from here on out. Let your eyes guide you as to what is really going on.
"All the FANG stocks are down. Just the start, keep shorting. Ka-Ching!"
"MySpace fell because there was no user base when FB came online. They lost their user base. Same thing happening with $TWTR. Lost a bunch of users and hasn't been profitable.I, on the other hand, have profited off their options. They will make lots of money while they tank"
"Bottom line the user retention rate and new user rates will be down dramatically. The less eyes on the platform the less ad revenue. There is a direct correlation. A Self inflicted wound. As large institutional holders continue too unwind their positions heading into earnings, law firms are putting together their class action lawsuits. The gap down on earnings during the after hours will likely be dramatic. Hilarity will ensue "

It is a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half. Maybe I am completely dead wrong. But I don't think so."

"Telegram surpassed 500 million active users in January, according to a statement from Pavel Durov, the messaging app’s founder. Durov noted that 25 million people downloaded the platform in just 72 hours. In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA.This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We’ve had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different.People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users."

"Business Insider sees Twitter's weakness. ""In this week's issue of New York Magazine (February 1, 2021), I make the case that Twitter's toxicity and subpar financial results are one and the same problem, amenable to one and the same solution. Fixing Twitter starts at the top — replacing an absentee CEO — and from there, changing the company's business model. The potential rewards are worth it, both economically and socially....All of this — Twitter's weak financial performance and its toxic content — is the result of a broken business model."""

"It's less about Jack banning the President and more that he is able to ban whoever hurts his feelings. If TWTR is able to censor the New York Post for an accurate story without doing any research or validation, they can do this to anyone.

I wonder what the breakdown on that 1.9 trillion dollars between red and blue states. Most people have no clue how much that is. If you stacked 1.9 trillion one dollar bills it could go around the world approx 5 times.
Twitter is going down!
Over the last 4 years we've seen people beaten in airports and on streets and ejected from restaurants just because they were wearing a hat someone didn't like. Attending a political rally was to walk through a throng of shrieking belligerents. To ask unpopular questions (or express an opinion) about how votes are counted and processed and how a count can run negative is to be called a liar and deranged. Where is Twitter and Facebook during all of this? Busy helping America decay.
Twatter is next. $FB $TWTR
"Twitter and Facebook not only rob you of your fundamental right of freedom of speech, they also remove your right to privacy, since they SELL YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. And you probably wondered how you got hacked or how your personal data ended up on the Dark Web?"
"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell directly blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting last month's riot but voted Saturday to acquit him anyway of inciting an insurrection.McConnell sharply criticized his former ally in a speech on the Senate floor shortly after Trump was cleared in a 57-43 vote, saying the rioters had been ""fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth. Because he was angry he'd lost an election."
will be in the 30's next week.

The discourse on twitter all of a sudden is substantive and reality-based. Users love it. Great business decisions have been made over the past month.
Where’s the guy who was posting “$50 stock” for the past 6 years?
Twitter has all the necessary wings to fly to the $100's.
I get the feeling that TWTR unwittingly united both the left and the right against big tech and social media. The left just doesn’t know it yet.
Exit before this plummets

"The US is focusing on American politicians but the actions by TWTR et al have an international blowback. Basically, people like German Chancellor Merkel have openly stated disagreement with TWTR and others because they see that they could be silenced. But, those countries will shut them down first.

Down to single digit volume of buyers.... lol
This is absolutely beautiful! Patriotism wins every time! Hedge funds dumping TWTR and FB due to legal instability!
"All across our country black farmers are going to be awarded a billion dollars more than white farmers.

Great not to hear Fat Donnie anymore!
Twitter share holders you have already lost 20% in the last 7 trading days !The million dollar question is how much more money are you willing to loose ? Another 20-40
Hatred rejected. It's a beautiful thing. Fly birdie fly!
My wife Kamala

“Well done Jack! I could learn much from you.”
"No worries- up slightly on relatively light volume. ""Lower"" days are just ahead."
Make your bets....Red or Green at close?
Twitter shorts are crying
"sewer swalwell named as impeachment manager. his guy was in bed with Fang Fang.I have seen it all. Dems out of control, can do whatever they want, no laws no nothing. dump all lefty media now"
PUTS/SELL/SHORT are 3 good choices??? IMO
Delete your Twitter account!
"The market is up today supposedly because weekly unemployment claims were not off-the-wall terrible , just terrible. These new claims are historically high when compared to pre-covid levels. Sounds like really ""good news"" to me. It is reasonable to expect retraction later today, when an objective understanding of this new data emerges. Twitter owners have been given a temporary gift to sell at a profit."
Surprised this gif hasnt been removed.
46 an hour from now. Short it...
I’m a buyer at $7
"Dorsey should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom for courageously silencing Donnie’s megaphone, knowing full well it would result in a temporary loss of daily active users."
$5 DIVE TODAY. $10 Billion will be written off of Twitter's value this very day.
Wait till Parler comes back up
"I admit I have never used Twitter and had to do some research on what value it has. I am baffled as to why people need a social media avenue that seems to divide our country. After accessing Twitter, I an glad I never got involved in the drama. You have to ask yourself are you a better person with Twitter in your life? The healing won't begin until services like this get some controls."
Repukes are getting dumped left and right by private industry. Haha! You got to love it! Now walmart and disney are dumping them.
Yahoo just took down my post about the BLM Activist who has been arrested for invading the Capitol and egging on others to do damage. It was a set-up people.

Artificial 'bump' up isn't fooling anyone. This stock has *nothing* good in its future -- it's going to the 20's.
Who would be buying this stock? It going nowhere. You will see a bump from those holding out for miracle. It's dead. Jack Dorsey just tossed it away.
This will be just like yesterday.....open slightly up and then fall all the rest of the day.
3.5 billion in Debt and just lost 100 million users SHORTS this is a no brainer. Bear Flag on the 30 collapse is imminent Make sure you buy your put past earnings February 9th. EASY MONEY

Just love seeing this slowly tank! Dorsey=dope! 
China is going to eat our lunch. Several schools in some of our large cities have less than 50 percent graduate. One school in Philadelphia a student only passed 3 classes in high school and he was in the middle of his class. There are two high schools in a large city near where I live. Each school has only 1 person proficient in math. Tell me how our country is going to compete in the world markets.
Will hit 66 within week
"Have you had enough yet? No coincidence it underperformed the market again. The company destroyed itself, with no regard for the shareholders, just the selfishness and loathing driven by Jack Dorsey part time CEO, has no significant financial stake in this either.What does he care?But he does care about $SQ where he has his wealth and is also CEO.Maybe SQ should be treated the way Dorsey treated TWTR shareholders, which was with no regard."
Even Uganda realizes Twitter is done.
"Has anyone else noticed whats going on in Portland....People are beginning to run over "" peaceful protestors "" with their cars..."
"Odd isn't it, that an app which is based on trying to get people to communicate is actively trying to silence its users. Ditch Dorsey and Ditch Twitter."
"Give it 5 years and TWTR will be under $ 5.00 a share , Conservatives will go elsewhere and liberals just want their opinions only ."
Just deactivated my account.
Jack Dorsey won’t need all these employees after he looses half of his business! Awww the poor liberal putz s will be jobless
#$%$ company and manipulated stock - should be in the $40s
"The user who goes by the name “Stephen”, he is a winner lmao. Look at his posts, and do EXACTLY the opposite of what he predicts! He’s been saying Twitter will crash close to a year now! I bought as much as I possibly could since the price fell to $30... I’ve made $200k just in 2021 alone so far doing the exact opposite of a genius prophet like “Stephen” The brother hasn’t figured this out yet, he does what he predicts. But as long as you do the opposite of what he predicts, you will make money. Nobody tell him "
Deactivated.
another red day when the market is soaring... why did we invest in this dog?
"Lol “Texas”McCarthy worries liberals will seize upon the catastrophic grid failure in Texas, the loss of life and injuries. Meanwhile Lyin’ Ted, Founder of the Coup Crew and Ted’s Capitol Tours, was flattened by his august tweet digging California during its worst wildfire season in record. Texas!"
"keep in mind the richest person in the world holds this stock more than likely. Also ask yourself. Do we need facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram? No. We need to become humans again."

"if this message board is proving anything, there is going to be a ton of volume in TWTR on Monday."
"All US stocks need go down to 2/3 of the price right now, cuz way way overvalued, except for financial stocks"
Twitter in 4 years
Jack Dorsey always wins remember that
Volume shows a slight sell off and this will continue for a few weeks ! I see this going back to 30 or lower
Sell....run
"So many people have left, Dorsey and Twitter is done. What a mistake!"
"Ouch, heading for a 3% loss today. Why are so many accounts being cancelled and moving to another platform?"
Wait!! How about parler taking over???? 
Slipping to $50 by the end of March.

even if you don't like mega you should still have the decency of not supporting a company that censors
Twitter saw its market cap plunge by $3.5 billion.way to go jack!
Just make sure you go to your settings and DELETE the account. DEACTIVATE.
This is another GME. wait till next earnings.
Elevator down
Does anyone look at the EPS!!
Ya the only reason I had Twitter was to see what POTUS says next !
"Since Yahoo keeps deleting my posts: Sell this stock, protect Freedom!!!!"
jack caught by project veritas is deeply troubling... he should be removed by the board for abandoning his fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders... he actions are tanking the stock. I will be asking my mutual funds to divest as well..
going to buy some shares..... once its gets below one dollar a share.thinking 70 cents per share is a good entry price ?should happen around the middle of march.
Support Point is at 44.93. Take that out and this thing is in freefall...
Just short more
Twitter up $28.00 since January. you the man Dorsey
"Looks like shorts are steam rolled AGAIN, because they’ve been clobbered 3 times a year, every year since obama took, office in 2009. The bitter clingers here aren’t short Twitter, they aren’t even capitalists in the stock market. They don’t know Weber, their vocabulary isn’t job creator — it is angry warehouse dock worker who desperately needs another swipe at my cash and success. Go play in your parler and gab about your grams. Smoke your meth and count your remaining stink teeth on one your one up sticky hand. We know why masks were a burden. Capitalists they’d call themselves. Indeed hah"
the yahoo communist minimum wage censors won't let you mention all the rioting and looting that took place last summer.....
"With only a relatively small amount of their shares being shorted, 2.7%, many hedge firms might short Twitter in the very near future. Couple this possibility with mutual funds unloading some of their shares, Twitter's stock price could be in deep trouble."
"Twitter is a dead man walking now. The videos of Jack saying how he was going purge conservatives from the platform, put the final nails in the coffin."
A breakout I’ve (we’ve) been waiting 3-4 years for. Sit back and watch!

"I hate this stock. Even with a miss, how does the market justify such a huge discount to other companies in the social media space?"
Limp wrist Dorsey and his embarrassing nose ring are about to get hammered worse than he’s ever known. This isn’t China Jacky boy! Censoring politicians in America is not a good look!
Impeach the president. Now
Shorts are scared everywhere

good entry point ... that is if you want to lose half of your money!
censorship is not good for the stock price
North Dakota just hit Twitter hard with a new Bill. Good riddance!
"Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can. Make money on these Commies !!!"
TWTR and FB should be made to realize that they need us more than we need them. Especially true of TWTR.
Buy/cover short
"Come on, baby! I shorted at $56 and doubled down at $79...only a little more to go before profitability. GL to all."
"communist social media dropping like a dead fly, love to see it!"
Boycott Twitter advertisers! I canceled my account but tell me who they are and my business will go elsewhere.
"Id like to know how many shares Oppenheimer sold into their ""price raise"". Or if they received any kinda of compensation of any kind.This is the type of stuff, regardless of political leanings, is what our government should be working to rid us of!"

This is great! Sold at 68. Bought March puts!
It is spreading all over the net that Pelosi has been arrested. Pelosi hasn't been on Twitter since the 8th. She tweets frequently and 1 of her comrades would have covered for her by now.
"For the first time in my life I've shorted a stock this week. And when it briefly climbed, shorted it again! TWTR is in a graveyard spiral, and I intend to ride it all the way to the ground. I'm up $250 so far. You don't deny the duly-elected President of The United States free speech!"
In short as of right now
Isn’t Twitter violating the Constitution that our families fought for? Maybe I’m right.
"Veritas has now released a video from a whistle blower that Jack Dorsey stated he is going to continue to censor conservatives as a larger project going forward. The video is posted on gateway pundit for investors to see. If I didn't know any better I wold swear Jack Dorsey is on a suicide mission involving Twitter. As a result I see Twitter continuing it's downward spiral which is roughly down 18% off the highs on January 6th. I don't see that changing as Twitter will reach the thirties over the coming weeks. This film won't do investors any good who believe Jack should try and repair those on the right which make up half of the nation. My guess is that Twitter lost at least 44 million of the 88 million subscribers who followed Trump. So you might say the ""Cancel Culture"" cancelled Twitter!"

"TWTR is past its prime. No matter what price targets the insiders put on it. With 0 earnings and 0 dividends, censorship of half its users, and upcoming govt regulations worldwide, eventually it is going down. Social media doesn't stay the same forever. A new popular platform shows up and it is done. Enjoy while it lasts. I expect it to eventually reach its 2016 lows. Yes, there will be rallies and sell offs on the way. It won't go down in a straight line."

"The Biden administration has now directed the IRS to link tax returns with party registration. 1984 is here folks, and fully supported, no, advocated by TWTR"

Ban twitter
"With all the legal beagles big tech has, you would have thought someone in the legal profession would have been aware of Military code 11.3.

I give a price target of $0.00
"Twooter actually said this today: ""Ahead of the Ugandan election, we're hearing reports that Internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps.We strongly condemn internet shutdowns – they are hugely harmful, violate basic human rights and the principles of the #OpenInternet."""

Can't believe this stock is still going strong. I sold too early but I made a nice profit buying just before the earnings release. Way to go for all who held.

How is my $40 buy not filled?!
Twitter is nothing but a leftist echo chamber with fake accounts. Get out of this stock before it crashes. They are not hiding Joe for giggles. He is impaired. Soon the market may crash. There is not enough cash to pay off the masses like they are trying to do.
Today was a blast. Thanks to the longs for hanging in there so the ride down is not too quick for the Patriot's extended enjoyment.

"Growth tech names like $ZM $TSLA $SNAP $PINS $SFIX $TWLO $NVDA $TWTR etc. selling off for a simple reason. Powell saying that when the economy returns to normal so will inflation. This leads to strong fundamentals growth (booming economy) but rising rate environment. Rising rates hit DCF discount rates on growth stocks (all of the aforementioned names have huge multiples). This means the highest multiple stocks start coming back to reality. I've been rolling back into my highest conviction names. As fundamentals show their strength, the market will likely get over the temporary valuation correction and re-rate growth names higher. I'm not going long value tech ($INTC or $FB or $AAPL), I'm going to stick to what works. Long $PINS and $SNAP more specifically."
"MeWe, a social media app centered around data privacy, has seen a surge in downloads in recent weeks as Big Tech companies crack down on user content.

""MeWe solves these problems."""
"If this was normal Monday, TWTR would be in 43's or lower."
This is just monday wait till end of month will go to 0
They’re trying to prop this up and it’s obvious
so this chat is censored as well. my post was deleted. How sad. I did not post any lies or hate. just the reason why I deleted my Twitter account.
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out anti-First Amendment censorship. Works for the Chinese.

"I'm noting that the DOW is 30.7K when 4 years ago it was around 19.5K. Let's see if it goes up from here, or down from here the next 4 years."
I am still seeing money rotating out of $FB and $TWTR and into other smaller cap tech stocks.
TWTR also out on google and apple app store
People should not buy from Amazon and apple. Stay away Twitter and Facebook! Don’t use google search!
"Oh no, the Dow is down for the 4th consecutive day. Looks like Sleepy Joe has awakened the long hibernating Bear Market with his ill advised executive orders. A MAJOR market correction is just around the corner, especially for seriously inflated tech stocks like Twitter."
"Never used Twatter or Facistbook and never will. It's a brainwashing/mindcontrol tool run on people's dopamine receptors. Probably the worst thing for education, IQ, attention spans, and society in general."

Bet Twitter don't tweet about todays losses. BUT I will. lol
It takes a lot courage to hold TWTR thru the weekend.Best to get out before the closing bell.
"feel bad for the investors in Twitter, but this is what Twitter deserves."
Did anyone actually read the company earnings presser where a Q1 loss was forecast?That has been buried.
"I say again, the ONLY asset Twitter and Facebook have are its users and if they are so high and mighty to discard them at will, then they get what they deserve."
Twitter to 10 dollars by March. Shorted more!
Every share holders of Twitter and board members should demand Dorsey to step down from his post for his lack of fiduciary duties to share holders . He should be placed in square!
Nobody needs Twatter
Dropping Twitter was the best thing of all. It seems Twitter is a hub or racist activities. Look at how much Twitter triggers violence across the globe. How many times do we need to see law enforcement post things liek we seen in Kentucky where they are the ones triggering racist activities? it is shameful for anyone who works at Twitter and contribute to global anarchy and unrest
the only positive thing about today is it's one less day we have to put up with DEMENTIA boy and kamel toe. gonna be a loooong funny 4 years. unless ;)
Twitter bull shredding shorts. Ha!
If your personal information is hacked through Twitter their is evidence that Twitter will not tell you and your bank accounts and assets are at EXTREME RISK! Do not follow Jack Dorsey into his dark place!
Next $ 40 then $ 37 up to $ 20
2nd shortsqueeze lol
"Remember MySpace, dBase, Wordperfect, Novell, Wordstar, Lotus? Yeah, neither does anyone else. That is where Twitter is heading. To the scrapheap of apps that have failed to keep up with their customers’ needs."

Back down. Falling. My guess is below the $65.80 it started the day at. Way below that.
"According to the Associated Press, Defense and National Guard officials found that violent rioters coordinated their plans to storm the Capitol Building in part on Twitter, a platform that often silences conservatives under the false pretense of preventing violence."
"Deleted all social media accounts, and boycotting all PGA advertisers."
"Short this stock to hades. It was trading for $22 in March 2020, and frankly that was double what it was worth. I personally don't think it's worth 10c."
"America is also freedom of choice. America you have a choice. I am a Finance guy, but have a minor in law. I was reading about legal challenges TWIT may face. It will be tough, they are a private company. Some one could challenge them and focus on their ""consistency of applying their own policies"". That may have a leg to stand on. Arbitrary deleting and suspending accounts?? If they did it to president because of violence threat OK although I may not agree OK. BUT, letting Iran keep up its post on killing americans (and yahoo police its a fact go look at it) is opening them up for legal challenges. The way to get back at TWIT is to delete your accounts. That's FREEDOM OF CHOICE. DONT USE THEIR SERVICE. That is the most powerful action Americans can take that don't agree. its very simple. Advertisers want return for their $$$. They will drop TWITTER or ask for reduced rates. Twitter earnings will suffer. Stock price will tank. Good luck"
Membership will likely fall as TWTR is not as popular among next generation of users. TWTR seen as grandparents social news.
better hurry!sell $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL TWTR
Bye-Bye Donnie
Darn futures under pressure again this morning. We need what happened to $TWLO yesterday. Down more than 4.5% intraday then up more than 10% after ER. I suppose it could go either way with this strange market that still punishes solid top line and bottom line beat like $NOK and $AKAM. Seems like a beat is no longer sufficient and you have to be in favor like $SNAP and $TWTR to be treated properly after ER these days. I hope the revenue and earnings beat is sufficient to warrant such favortism today.
Coming Up On The Bottom!
Looks like my $60 end of Feb PT was way too conservative. Upgrading to $75 by analyst day. EZ $ brought to you by MAGA short bus insurrectionists!

Loving my shorts..
With all this censoring that they are doing they are going to go down quickly. I along with thousands have already terminated our accounts. Users and engagement times have a big effect on stock prices.
Better have your orders in to dump this stock first thing Monday. This thing is going to tank by atleast 30%. I have seen so many people deactivate their accounts. Bye bye AD dollars.

Nor will the media ask who they are."

Private Company my ars. So why is it Publicly traded with government subsidies? This company will not be able to handle the tsunami of lawsuits coming in.
I guess NIO is down 7% and NVdA is down 3% because parler is back up and Twitter has fewer users.
And how are our little Twitter snowflakes holdin’ up during the Twitter rout.

Dorsey must have taken a fresh hit off of the meth pipe before making the decision to censoring free speech
Nice moves this week $ENPH $QS $CHWY $PYPL $DDD $TWTR were a few of my best performers. $GBTC is Rock'n'Roll!! Looking for a big move north for $PLTR when it reports before the bell Tueday. Not priced for perfection. A weak pocket to be taken advantage. $RKT perhaps the best value in the entire market. Enjoy the weekend. Buy $PLTR after hours. Premarket on Tuesday may be a little late.
Give it time.

"This country is going to have an ex military and maybe active military problem.. It's already started as several of those in the capitol building are highly trained highly decorated US Military... They took an oath to the constitution and the constitution was not followed with those states changing their election rules/laws.. Even Democrats understand that a rejection rate dropping from 3% to under .5% is not a trustworthy result.. With the number of mailed in ballots, the rejection rate would be UP not Down.."

Twitter keeps losing money and that matters...when the bubble bursts
"Oppenheimer’s Jason Helfstein’s statement that he’s not concerned about the decision to silence Trump shows his ignorance—or possible deception (i.e., should he be attempting to exit under cover of an upgrade). Dorsey risked disenfranchising roughly half of the US market, when the future of Twitter—a company that has yet to prove it’s staying power—is in question. Does anyone really feel that TWTR is important or necessary? Trump might have seen it as important once—but who else other than a boatload of forgettable self-absorbed people trying to make themselves relevant?"
"Twit CEO asked for this, now he's getting it. I only had a few hundred shares, but sold them all."

"If you don’t stand up to these companies soon , it will not matter , they will restrict everyone ! Cancel them, before they cancel YOU !"
deactivated FB and Twitter. Going to cancel AMZN and Google as well. They are going down. Sell!
Honest question other than just saying Twitter will tank. Best strike prices for puts seeing as earning are feb 9th? Puts will print
Some companies you just enjoy seeing fail. And this is one of them. Facebook will be another. No tech company is bigger than America itself.
This is what you get when you censor more than half of America.Believe it or not...... We are the silent majority!
You think it's bad now.....Wait until HARRIS PICKS CORTEZ AS HER NEW VICE PRESIDENT......

What is propping this stock up? Almost everyone I know has stopped using Twitter.
SELL before it’s too late. User lost and law suits will definitely drag Twitter down. JD is not protecting the investors. Too bad for us.
Russia doesn't seem to like TWTR. Would not be surprised to see it banned over there. Not good for TWTR. Nope.
Parler up and running.
Anyone who would invest in a company that eliminates free speech is not an American

SNAP > TWTR?
"I read that Dorsey is selling off, he knows the end is near."
I did a 1 day chart overlay of $PINS and $TWTR (feel free). They are veritable copies of each other today.Not sure why they are so linked at the hip except social media ... thoughts?
Gosh. Do ya think it's a bubble?
"I don’t agree with Allred that the investigation into the Sussex claims are a distraction from Prince Andrew and his pizza express problems. Those investigations are well underway, properly funded, and appropriate pressure is being applied. Maxwell is in jail, and all she needs to do is roll over. Who cares if her hair is falling out and her toes are rotting from diabetes. She was the order procurer and processor. Once she confesses, then the interview with Prince Andy proceeds so that he can entrap himself."
just the fact that most negative posts are more political and less about the business is quite intriguing.
Impeached twice because he was doing the right things - they hated him Period this is Good vs evil Independent voters have woken up u don’t take away freedom Sell / short and delete the China run company
$55 dollar again
Look at all the liberal city’s ! Just in case you haven’t noticed. The money is leaving because of high taxes and safety

On Monday Twitter -20%
"Next earnings release TWTR is going to get crushed .. Its already posted a miss on monetizable daily active users, reporting 192 million vs. 193.5 million expected."
Send in the Social Workers this stock is getting murdered...
Love to watch the slide. The hivemind is dying. All of the little commie investors in this company. Are getting a hard lesson in capitalism. They love to protest and cancel so long as it does not affect their pocketbook. Their virtue signaling and embrace of cancel culture is starting to backfire. Way too many free aps out there way better than this liberal echo chamber.
"WARNING: $TWTR future subscription and writer models will be SEVERELY impacted by Facebook's action. Appears Mr. Zuckerberg is out to sink Mr. Dorsey. INVEST ACCORDINGLY! Remember, $FB is markedly below their 1 year share price target while $TWTR is AT their 1 year share price target.Facebook (FB) to Launch New Platform for Independent Writers9:54 am ET March 17, 2021 (Zacks)Facebook FB is in the process of introducing a self-publishing platform for independent writers and journalists, which would support them in terms of content creation and audience growth, per a Reuters report. It will be integrated with Facebook's Pages to enable publishing across multimedia formats including photos, live videos and stories style updates.The idea is that writers can earn through subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community.Facebook will allow them to create Groups for their work as well, and also provide metrics on their newsletters. To pilot the program, Facebook plans to pay to help get the tools to build actual websites, in addition to newsletters, off the ground. Moreover, the company will look to add monetization tools later."

"soros & gang are supporting the stock, part of the deal"
TWTR is today's Tokyo Rose. An incredible source for forms of propaganda. Opinion without truth or verification. Amazing they are allowed to operate as they do.
"In all the years I have been investing, I have never shorted any stock. But I may want to very soon. Im thinking Twitter and Facebook are both losing subscribers now. And when Parler comes back on line at the end of the month, many more subscribers are likely going to leave those two jokes of ""social platforms""..."
"While this is tanking today bite on this ., EPS is -1.58. This is a shell of company for one purpose, propaganda. It will vanish sooner than later as its mission is complete. The Commies will take their money and run looking for new world order in another corner of the planet."
Looks like that tweeter bird got knocked out of the nest today
"Not a huge drop like I expected, but wait until they release their quarterly numbers and have to reveal the. Umber of subscriber/users they last for the quarter. The day of reckoning is still coming. There’s still lots of room to go down before you can say the bad news is already built into the stock price."

Watch for a flood of shareholder lawsuits against Twitter as the stock price continues to drop. The reason for the decrease is executive mismanagement.

"Why no action against Twitter? Remember, years ago politicians tried to destroy MSFT in the name of autonomous and monopoly. etc! What's going on now?"
And this moment nothing can save TWTR.
Twitter was cool before they started censoring.
"Down nearly twenty percent since the censorship of a sitting President and an attempt to alienate half of America's population, wonder why? I thought liberals were responsible for all of the social media and on-line spending or at least that is what they claimed."

"Tomorrow is the beginning of the end for the stock market, economy, and our country, Democrats will destroy it all, it won't happen in 1 day, 1 week, or even 1 year but will slowly do so over time, and the ones that will suffer the most are the young people who will be burdened with the enormous trillions of dollars of debt and a hopeless future for our country with the Democrat rule and their policies! Was just watching the video of Summer Breeze by Seals and Crofts on Youtube from 1972, takes me back to simpler times of the 70's when the world was a much nicer place to live in and life was less complicated and so much better, so glad I lived through those times, these poor young people of today...they'll never know!"

"Now, I do admit $SNAP is mostly saturated domestically and in Europe in terms of usage. The real user growth opportunity is going to come from international (think Mexico, East Asia, Latin America, etc.) where purchasing power is lower, but Android is the predominant mobile operating system. In $SNAP's Analyst Day event they highlight the ways they are going to sustain strong engagement. At this point in time, $SNAP has differentiated itself enough from the competition that the risk of competition grabbing users is likely minimal. It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing. At the end of the day, I'm focused on the long-term of this company. The biggest concern about this company is it's valuation. And believe me, I understand the concern. At ~15.7x '22 revenue, it's not cheap. Or is it? Let me break down my valuation for this business, and why it could generate so much more in returns than $FB or $TWTR."

Twitter pumpers are really trying....you’re going to lose more money
More Pump and Dump eh? Project Veritas spilled the beans on what Dorsey is up to. The bottom will fall out of this today.
I believe the current CEO of Twitter has chosen the path that was given to him by more powerful people. He is not actually capable of making these waves of change decisions on his own while spending 90% of his time disconnecting from his worst fear...people.
The value of Twitter has fallen so much that Twitter should settle out of court with Parler and just sign the company over to Parler.
Puts outweigh the calls 3 to 1. Twitter wont see green for awhile...

"Here's why I am bearish on Twitter.... It ran up like 40ish% in like the last 3 months. (too far too fast). So Twitter use was up big because of the elections... people were involved and using Twitter for their info and news source, that ran the stock price up, I get it. When twitter reported the increase in users, everyone assumed that increase would be permanent.... Then they banned President Trump.... then they started kicking off (permanent suspensions) a ton of conservatives! Twitter got super boring with those big name conservatives gone... I've noticed it myself... I mean BORING. Conservatives are jumping ship in big numbers to GAB. When Twitter went all out with there bans and censoring, everyone started jumping to Parler, but then amazon who hosted Parlers servers shut them down. Everyone jumped to GAB. Gab is a GREAT platform that does not censor. People are finding all their old twitter favorites on GAB now. Conservatives love GAB & don't really care to go back to Parler & will never go back to Twitter. Twitter shot itself in the foot by banning and censoring 50% of it's users. What were they thinking?? And they are still banning on a daily basis. Everyone knows one day they will wake up and find themselves kicked off of twitter so they are establishing their Gab accounts. Honestly, GAB is a better looking more user friendly site than twitter and they don't limit the characters/ words you can use in a post. I know this post jumps around but I'm on my way out the door so don't have time to proof read. In short, Twitter is going to go down because President Trump and other big names have been kicked off, the elections are over so people are spending their time elsewhere, conservatives are jumping to GAB in great numbers because all their favorites are there, because they know their twitter days are numbered before they get banned... and many are also leaving in protest to Twitter. I left and haven't looked back! Twitter is headed down big time.... maybe even back to the 30's."

HIGH VOLUME SELLOFF will continue. Twitter lost of millions of users permanently.
315 million moentizable users sounds very bullish. People buying at 70s are expecting it to reach to $150 in an year or so. So I am not selling a single share.
Who remembers MySpace? What about Friendster? Twitter has passed its apogee and there is no turning back.
Gee I wonder why Jack Dorsey doesn't want regulation and the government to be able to track the $50 million in Bitcoin that Twitter purchased.

"I thought we were about “personal responsibility”, Respect For Others, obeying property rights, and The Constitution here in America? Which one of you is responsible for this one? Seems like all of you at the Grievance Gazette are. He’s white and homeless and I don’t see any of you wealth barons offering him a $15 an hour job to earn his way out of Jack in the Box despair. He says he’s tried 100 job applications. You say he’s a commie and just wants to eat his birds. There’s truth there somewhere. According to the police, James Schulz, 53, entered the restaurant Wednesday night without a face mask. He was requested to wear one to be served or use the drive thru. The customer ""belligerently refused,"" Ratliff said, and accused the restaurant staff of not wanting to serve him because he was homeless.Schulz then walked toward the door, and as the manager turned his back, he allegedly ran behind the manager, tackled him and stabbed him multiple times in the arm and upper torso with what appeared to be a pocketknife, according to Ratliff."

"Amazing! Simply amazing! I have learned that the many conservatives that refuse to leave Twitter are still there for one main purpose. Evangelism. That's it, that's the only reason. It's enemy territory being infiltrated for the cause of Christ. That's the only reason I kept my Facebook account, but I cancelled Twitter (even though it used to be my favorite form of SM). Let's see how long this post lasts?"
twitter revenue is higher than snap. and twitter is profitable the last two quarters. yet snap market cap is almost nearly twice bigger than twitter market cap? whats going on here??
55 dollar stock
"Cancel culture, buy nothing from local or any business that is owned by a liberal"
TWTR definitely has strong support at $0
how is twitter stock going up? by the end of 2021 there will by like 30 accounts left cuz everyone else will have been banned.

"Hey SEC, any chance of looking at a company which in QE2, declared a loss of over $7 Million while handing away $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM? Also any chance of looking at a company whose CEO has actively discouraged half the users to leave his platform, doesn't sound like due diligence to me."
TWTR will see $ 20 before seeing $ 50
A very smart liberal friend of mine who enjoyed leaving negative replies to Trumps tweets said Twitter is violating his constitutional right to communicate with his government. Think about that- censorship cuts both ways. Wasn't it after all a court that ruled Trump cant ban people from his twitter because it violates their constitutional rights?
Twitter CEO took up a short position before announcing Trump ban. No doubt about it.
"Based on Twitter not having all that many users to begin with, they lost millions in America. Under the radar are the millions more overseas who deleted Twitter. With that there’s hardly anything left on the bone yet look at the price. Way too high."

"TWTR and FB need to be regulated. We need a law to require every social media account to be verified by a drivers license and the name you use on the account needs to match the license. Also the name needs to be fully public on your profile, comment posts and so on. No more anonymous accounts."
It’s hilarious how the big players are trying to pump this back up. It’s gonna fall hard earnings
"in the 30's next week, way to go jack !!!!"
Unequivocally unamerican to own this stock.
Don't be deceived by this earnings release. It actually makes sense because this report includes data when trump was still on the platform and during this time he was causing all sorts of drama due to the election situation. The next earnings release is the one you need to be concerned with since those earnings will include when Trump was banned and the subsequent fallout from it.
"No one reads your diatribes, DEC. Stock up on tissues for 2024."
TWTR to $100 this year!!
Looks like it's more than just 80 million people leaving the platform. Other countries are already banning it and more are planning on banning the app in the future. This is a global wipeout of the company.
I just deactivated my Twitter account and deleted the app from my phone like many others here. I just don’t like the thought that they have the power to deactivate and ban me if they so wish. I tend not to hang out where I’m not welcomed unless I relinquish control of my basic rights as a human being. I don’t own this stock and never will.
I just joined GAB !

"I see the stock is going up in the pre market, guess people don;t care about free speech, so sad"
Twitter is in the lead at the race to zero. In second place we have facebook followed by Google Apple and Amazon. Its been some race today.
The volume on the March put options with a strike of $20 is increasing. Volume on call options is off the charts. The options are very volatile to the down side for TWTR. People buying this stock long are probably amateurs.
Trump and many others have already filed lawsuits against Twatter. Wait till the lawsuits from ad companies come in. They #$%$ too! They paying all this money with no subscribers. Haha

"Great job twitter Revenue rose 28% to $1.29 billion, compared with the $1.19 billion average analyst prediction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twitter on Tuesday cited “strong brand advertiser demand in the U.S.” as a driver of ad sales in the fourth quarter, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Net income rose to $222 million, or 27 cents a share. Twitter reported 192 million daily active users, 26% growth from a year earlier but shy of estimates for 193.4 million. Overall for 2020 the company added 40 million new daily users, crediting the gains to both “product improvements” and a series of major events that drew in audiences, including the U.S. presidential election and discussion around the global Covid-19 pandemic. You the the ed man Dorsey"
Why the heck is this stock up in this bear market.
baizuo - Find out ... look it up
TWTR target 37.50 this week
Timber!!!
Shouldn’t a company loosing money for so long be in bankruptcy ? They are heading for a shutdown. Workers treated poorly. The caw union is coming.
38 cents. Best ever quarter
TWTR will trend down for days and days as more bad news sinks in
"TWTR is a fantasy for longs. The dream will end once Jack comes clean about the exodus that occurred after his company went cuckoo. That said, I had to cover my short at 50 and change, because I'd rather have taken a small loss than get swept away by frothy insanity (look at GME as an example!). I'll probably short again once a top has been established."
"I don't know about shareholders suing but even as a private frim there is arguably many laws broken since it's a publicly traded company violating First Amendment Rights, These actions would be more under the Securities Exchange Commission rule and TWTR could become a candidate for Delisting under the very similar and policy invoked and utilized this week to to delist China Telecom's. But way before delisting TWTR will be trading at $10.00. The other repercussions I'm seeing on Dark Cloud websites are lists of the TWTR Advertisers people who fight for Freedom of Speech have listed and instructed to boycott those consumer products. I think 75 Million to 80 Million people boycotting those products will get those Advertisers to pull their support and advertisements from TWTR by the end of next week."
Watch how the violent crime rate goes up in the next 4 years along with the cost of living.....
I hope social media companies drop like a rock
This stock should be in the range $38-42 like it did right after Q3 earnings!! Q4 earnings are no better than Q3's.

I never understood why anyone would have a Twitter account?? Just children like Tommy boy who are juvenile.
interesting take in this weeks Barron's. Either FB is dramatically undervalued...or TWTR dramatically overvalued...I guess we'll see which one it is in the coming weeks or months.
This is the ultimate stock for the GenX snowflakes. They hate freedom and hate America. Why do they stay if it’s so bad?
can someone explain this in layman's terms? Seems lie the overall market and this has cased us to sink.Twitter stock pulls back from record after the pricing of $1.25 billion in convertible debt. Why does a company do this? to raise money. I'm clueless .. sorry. Please no political b.s.. just trying to understand
todays price does not matter as the quarter numbers even if good are the last ones that even come close to being a profitable company. going forward will be substantially lower and loses even larger.
"They are trying a head fake !!! Short all you can. Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can."
The truth will set you free. Ironic that many who believed the big lie are going to jail.

"I love TWTR, but at this level it's overextended."
I just don't see the price as anything other than artificially inflated at this point.
This will be the third day in a row that the DOW is down. Is this the beginning of a bear market. Artificially inflated companies like Twitter are going to take a beating.
Millions of patriots deactivated their Twatter accounts.
"what happen if 50 millions account users turn into a class action lawsuit? that will be huge and ... possible these days. I don't own any of TWTR stock and not a fan of Trump but a private company should do business only. If they don't like what Trump does then they need to seek some kind of authority (somewhere and somehow, like Nacny, she is hungry of power, will give a bless if TWTR asks for one!). Why you mess your business with politics. What happen next will be lawsuit dismiss liability protection from social networking company. that will be a big loss for FB and TWTR. Google and Apple will be next too."
Top Bullish Charts | February 2021  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"$100 million buys you the best food, resorts, houses, travel... Since the world is finite, by the time you are up to $20 billion, it's the same stuff. So what do you do when your increasing wealth won't buy better stuff? You switch over to influencing and controlling other humans because everything else is achieved and nothing else matters. You could take a homeless man with a long beard and put him in as CEO of Twitter, and he will quickly become a censoring neocom like the rest of them. Carol Burnette was asked why she didn't mock republicans, and she said ""why would we chase away half of our audience?"" But marx-like censorship offends half of a company's users, the stock price skyrockets. The horse is already out of the barn and the pigs are up and walking on their hind legs. I wouldn't short this stock because that would make logical sense."
"I for one was never into social media; so I did noot have to ""leave"", but hearing what these big tech is doing, and thinking they can get away with it, I hope those of you who are leaving or have just left understand that Twitter and other similar entities realize they are in the wrong ONLY because they are losing money, and that they will change their ways, that you will NOT go back to them. It's up to you of course but when people are apologetic ONLY because they realize they are making money, and you as consumers go BACK to them, they still win. My hope is that once you leave, you leave for good."

That representation is not about what occurred on January 6th, that was just part of the piled on Circus side show's. The reasons why TWTR stock will plunge is also really separate from the events of January 6th. The reason why TWTR stock will fall, is about Social Media's actions relating to Freedom of Speech. You'd have to go back to Paul Revere and the Lanterns to understand that! TWTR has Violated the first Amendment and for that the Free World their is a price to pay. The U.S.A Citizens saw this type of control in China and Russia the suppression of free speech for years,. Our Free Capital Markets will surly send a message to not only TWTR, but to Facebbook, Google and others. In that group for many months to come will be product boycotts of advertisers as Products on those sights. There are 65 to 80 million Americans and maybe more who understand the Freedom of Speech and no change in administration is going to allow that to occur."

"Twitter is simply destined to fail. There is no other way to see it. Whether it be by Dorsey’s own doing, the public protests that are inevitable worldwide, or the simple lack of public support through the course of the next four years.

I suspect that once the Institutional holders break ranks the decline will be massive. No way this company has any real value.
Next week will be interesting. The gap between Wall Street and Main Street is now so wide something is bound to happen. Very poor job figures are coming in yet major indexes at all-time highs. Tech ads are going to see to people without a job and money? Will be interesting!
Twitter wanted Parler shut down because people were leaving witter by the millions. Not a sustainable model. Now they have angered half of America. Their business model is too easy to copy. They will be gone. Facebook will find that they have a flimsy model too. My company pulled all their advertising out of social media. Toxic environment.

"how is this good news ?08:47 AM EST, 03/01/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Twitter (TWTR) said Monday it plans to offer $1.25 billion worth of convertible senior notes due in 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers.The company said it also plans to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to buy up to an additional $187.5 million of the notes.The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of Twitter, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Twitter's common stock, or a combination of both, the company said.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Twitter expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or other financial institutions, the company said.Twitter plans to use a part of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, and the remaining proceeds pay any amounts due upon conversion or at maturity of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions.share dilution ?"

"Amazon ,Google, Facebook, and Twitter are the Southwestern Bell of the Twenty-First Century; Google controls 89% of the global internet searches.

"Twitter is going to fail, and here's why. What to watch now is how the so-called Tech Giants go to war with one another. Truth is they hate each other and want a slice of the same pie. Social media is a small part of it to Google and Amazon, they are competing for the Cloud market and the AI which is being rolled out to replace your jobs. I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI, and the plain truth is, that's what Covid is really about. It's blown out of proportion to lay off millions and replace them with IBM Watson and other products. Banks and other are already rolling it out. Meanwhile the battle rages betweem Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud. The war they are fighting between themselves keeps them divided (for now). Twitter is really just a fly on the wall to that lot, and they won't save Twitter."

He is pulling the wool over the eyes of his willing accomplices in the media, investment houses and political realm, but not on those of us that have seen the light! Okay, here's the problem. He's making a killing over at Square, because he had the foresight to get invested bigly in Bitcoin! That's keeping him afloat for now. And making me second guess my short position, for now! I may just hold it and add to it if the price rises 10-20% on the claims that censoring free speech and millions of conservatives leaving his platform don't matter to the bottom line. If you believe that, I have 20,000 bitcoin to sell you at 40k!"

In fact, all those people he kicked off of Twitter platform are now coming here to air out their grievances. Personally speaking, I quit posting on Nov 3 and then deactivated a few days ago. Reason being... I don't participate on platforms that are corrupt and try to brazenly manipulate and subvert the minds of the masses. @Jack did it, and now he is paying the price. And I've heard the one thing they hate is to have someone like me or you share our opinion publicly when it makes them look bad. Oh, the irony!!!"

Users leaving TWTR is only just beginning. Millions have left already - but that's just the beginning. Not many advertisers will want to waste money on this sinking ship. Those that do will only do so because the decision makers for those companies are as far left wing as Dorsey. Wasting company money to advertise just to support someone else's political stance will not sit too well with those companies and heads will roll. This ship is sinking - and it's not alone.
Hopefully these shorts keep averaging up and angering the market makers so that way we can continue this beautiful squeeze ride. Here's to all the stubborn shorts out there. Thank you

"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."

Falling knife... yikes One step forward two steps back...
80% of time I did not agree with Trump but to have TWTR remove the US president from the platform is a disgrace. Founding fathers made sure all citizens have the right to free speech. It is called the US constitution Mr Dorsey. This is a dark moment in our history. Conservatives need to create their own platform. I also say time to break down big business such as AMZN. They did it to Standard Oil. AMZN should be next

I really think Jack Goebbels Dorsey is getting tired of Twatter. You can tell the distractions it's causing him from keeping focused on grooming his beard and nose rings. I look for him to end up selling Twatter for anyone who takes it once it dives to the $5-$10/share region.

Open your eyes and be aware."
Let's short twitter

Leftists investing in Twitter stocks.
Jack has to go. Democrats don't control free speech.
"Twitter always had a problem monetizing their service which is why the stock really never went anywhere and I agree with Jim that it wasn't smart to ban the biggest draw they had, I'm sure thier share holders appreciate that Jack thought of being a moral cop before he thought of his share holders, that can be the end of a company because the decision making at the top has the wrong priorities for the share holders, he may feel better but his company may now die, their are competitors that will rise that allow free speech."
I personally don't care to take sides on the election or any other topic folks are going on about. But when a company takes away the freedom of speech ALL Americans are affected. What they did is basically Communistic censorship. It cannot be tolerated by any American as we ALL will suffer. These are difficult times that I hope we get through quickly but Twitter has done nothing but divide us further. I have cancelled by account and I truly hope they fail. This cannot be tolerated at any level.
"Stock quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good"

"Social media platform Twitter has locked the accounts of both Project Veritas and James O’Keefe following a recent report relating to Facebook’s VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen. The platform claims the report violates its policy on “posting private information,” and as a result, both O’Keefe’s personal account and the official account of Project Veritas have been locked, preventing them from posting."
"There’s about to be some BIG CHANGES coming down the pike for not only Twitter but $FB as well. These online platforms, along with others, have PROFITED off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of MISINFORMATION among Americans that has caused HATE AND DIVISION within our country. They’re platforms are being used as tools to organize MASS RIOTS all over the US. I’ve been against FB and Twitter from the very beginning. It was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be SHUTDOWN. There is very little, if anything, “social” about them."
"Does anyone know what the triggers are on those convertible bonds, any subjective analysis would probably indicate shareholders are getting the shaft when the converts are converted to equity.. a very dilutive effect. But what you expect from a CEO who looks like Rasputin and leans left. Perhaps his right-hand minister of censorship donkey Vijaya could give some of her salaries back when all the shareholders get diluted out.."
Make America great again!Sell Twitter

"Antifa and BLM were responsible for the Washington insurrection and renewable energy caused the snowstorm in Texas. Bigly. Believe me. Had the Turnip still been in Office this wouldn't have happened, that snowstorm could have just been Sharpie'd out of existence. Bigly. Believe me."
Interesting business strategy to tell half your user base they’re not allowed to say what they think on your “free speech” platform.Let’s see how this pays off for investors.
"And Yahoo just censored me again. Fair-minded people win cultural arguments with fact based persuasion. Liberal leftists win arguments by censorship. When this stock take because of the factual evidence that I've presented on this public forum, will Yahoo be liable? Yes, yes, if only someone is recording what I wrote before they took it down."

Get out of twitter now. No use to even entertain that platform. Let them eat themselves when no conservatives are twitter.

Think about it. You eliminate 50% of your business an your stock goes up. Could it be those who know are bailing while propping up their stock prices?
strong buy. people will come running back to tech. they are bored at home and have nothing better to do than trade stocks. and government is giving free money away.

Not really sure why this continues to move up. But when the trend isn’t your friend. It’s time to pack it up. My puts are going to be worthless I guess
Hold those short positions soon reward will be coming
twitter bird 2021.
High Volume SELLOFF. Dump will continue. Permanent loss of millions of users.
Real reason for twitters success was the following Trump had and it brought millions of users who otherwise wouldn’t be on Twitter or care to use Twitter. Not a good day and probably worse to come for this company
"Social(ist) Media now paying upwards of $30,000 for a single video from an ‘influencer’ (ref: CNN Business article 19 March 2021). Major Panic among socialist media now that all major intelligent ‘influencers’ have departed. My opinion, no, CNN, sorry.$TWTR and $FB future not as bright as yesteryear. Invest wisely. Read the CNN article and ask ‘What is going on here?’."
"Of all the FANG stocks, I really want Google to go down. Google is hidden under many names, but really Youtube banning conservative voices is the work of Google. Hurt Google and you hurt Youtube. I also cancelled Youtube TV, which was really awful anyway, and won't be missed."

Twitter sabotaging itself is saddening. Already struggling to engage teenagers thanks to tik tok & others. Will never recover

"I said it on Monday, saying it again today. Never underestimate the power of the Shorts. The Shorts are just getting started on this... Meanwhile Twitter is losing Billions in value."
I love the smell of longs losing more money in the morning. Smells like victory.
Twitter the place where you can say what you want. Until it's not what they want you to say
so everything crashed like 5-10% today and this stock went up. i hate the stock market im done im selling everything why the hell should any retail investor bother at this point??
Does anyone know which metrics twitter reports. I have uninstalled twitter on 3 of my android apps. hopefully they know that. I still access my account via the web and I haven't de-activated my account just yet because I do like to follow a little bit of sports news.is de-activating my account useful.. or is the lack of use enough.
People that like this company will live on their knees someday
"Isn’t it remarkable how after the Capitol was attacked Democrats found their moral compasses on criminality. When our businesses were burned & looted throughout the Summer Democrats were silent. When Police were attacked everyday killed and injured they were silent. When BLM injured dozens of Secret Service outside the White House Democrats were silent When the President had to be secured in the WH bunker silence again. They were silent when every statue was pulled down Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln not matter they were silent. The media encouraged violence, with CNN & MSNBC reporting as mobs looted, and fires burning in the background they were peacefully protest. Only when polls started to show their numbers dropping did they in a loud whisper say they were against violence. What happened at the Capitol we all agree was wrong. But how easily a man dressed as a furry and the rest of the rioters made as far as they did must be answered. The Capitol Police were warned, along with the DC Mayor the day before by the FBI. But the Mayor refused to activate the National Guard. Now 21,000 Guard are surrounding DC. Ask yourself why?"
Giving Twitter an upgrade and a buy signal is like giving the Roseanne cast an Emmy after they removed the star...
Parlor is going to buy Twitter at the bankruptcy sale.
"To be all honest what do you charge King Neptune with his spear standing in the halls of the Capital with? When compared to the Looters we saw in all major cities over the summer who got charged with nothing but got away with $billions in small business owners inventory? I think if you add the lives lost over the summer tied to the RIOTS. Police lost like 25 members and the damage done in those cities maybe as high as $700 Billion. I do think TWTR leaving the IRAN President's TWTR site active over the President of the Free World is a joke. It's why the Capital Markets will show TWTR what Freedom of Speech means in the U.S.A. Right or Wrong , Democrat or Republican Freedom of Speech will not be controlled by Social Networks in the U.S.A. Those who try to control it, well look at the close of trading on Friday for TWTR!"
"SO, about half the country will deactivate their accounts. Ha!"
Topping off with two bear flags in a row with 77rsi and a double top. The is an awful looking chart for longs

The trend is on. There will be a right leaning app for every leftist app. Every leftist app will see half its base leave. It will be slow in the beginning and get fast later as more and more people join new apps.
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx

Twitter and Facebook are selling your personal information to third-parties and even to bad actors outside the USA. That's why your id is being stolen people. They've been caught in the act.

"The war is over. Twitter does not realize it yet. Telegram has won hands down in users, interactions, functionality and the all important 'free speech'. BE VERY CAREFUL with Twitter either way, it is just a MANIPULATION stock now. Not much intrinsic value. Read the earnings report, where are all the tough questions and FY21 goodies? SOFTBALL."

Good point by one of the posters. The support will come from horrifics who support the socialist/marxist/globalist cabal. Won't last long as there are more of us than them.
If you disagree with Twitter and Facebook censoring opposing views dump your accounts. Don’t reward them for taking away your rights.

You know the billions in balance sheet cash Dorsey is throwing into TWTR to support its price? That cash is going to be depleted when the next quarterly report release (not this one). Slow and painful spiral to the OTC market.

"This will be like AOL and Netscape... Get out while you can. To my conservative allies, we don’t need to do everything at once. If we show one tech company at a time - this time, Twitter - and create our own platforms, counterparts to the other mainstream platforms will come about. A multi-millionaire or billionaire would be silly not to cater to conservative minded people for those platforms. They’d literally make a BOAT load. Will it take a while...? Sure, but, as with the story with the tortoise and the hare, we learn that slow and steady wins the race..."
TWTR down over 3x the naz. Ouch!
"Trumpsters lost the election, their attempt to steal the election, their relevance to public discourse, and their little red hats which the dog chewed up. But hey, TWTR is down a few percentage points!"

"Why do radicals on the left always accuse others of what they are doing ? Is it a learned behavior or a natural instinct to deflect when you don't have a valid argument ? Also remember when democrats said daca kids shouldn't be held responsible for the crimes of their parents, but then they turn around and blame all white people for 17th century slave owners?

Lying about the numbers. Jack is gonna pay for his manipulation
Citizens across the globe - cancel Twitter accounts - FREE SPEECH IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR! Investors will feel the financial PAIN!
"Q1 Earning APRIL 29. Co. presser promised to be NEGATIVE. I believe them, do you?"
I have never beer more wrong about a stock but still holding my March Puts just in case....
ill never regret this investment especially in the longrun :)
Twitter should release the names and Tweets of everyone banned.
D*e*v*i*l company shares go up...remarkable
"Liberals, please put you life savings in TWTR. Absolutely nothing bad will happen. going to the moon any day now!"
Twitter taught us all how to hate each other. Vicious savage hatred is what Twitter's all about.
"This dead cat bounces, then crashes. My phone battery now last 2+ days. I will never let Facebook or Twitter back on my phone, ever. I don't miss them at all."
this stock will continue drop a dollar a day for the next 4 months just like it did everyday this week
This thing will go to 0.000
"With all sincerity the average investors much prefer Apple stock for a long hold. TWTR exhibits extreme volatility which attracts day traders like me who have no real interest in the company, except in this case Dorsey has personally offended me."
COME ON 'E REDS!
I got in at 47 even though I have never touched twitter. No one person/event can stop tech monopolies. FB proved it last year and twitter this year.
"Mark my words, 30c on the otc markets in 6-months. The shorts are taking you down Jackie boy."

Thank you Jack for bringing the haters out of the woodwork and saving me time in muting them.
"Ideas have consequences, @Jack."
"If you have spent anytime around children in the past year while they are on a device, you know about Roblox. And if you're a parent, you also know about Robux (Roblox currency) as your credit card may have gotten charged by purchases made in-game. All I could think about was 'revenue' and when is the IPO.Developers have been looking for a new platform to take their talents further and also have greater freedom while reaching an entire new and broader age group of gamers.Enter RBLX.Roblox reminds me of Fortnite and Minecraft in popularity & style.I believe Roblox will be even more successful than Fortnite & Minecraft though.Roblox is more than gaming, and similar to Fortnite, will take entertainment and social media to a new level that many can't grasp...especially if you're over the age of 40.Roblox is capturing majority of the 6 to 18 year olds, and in the next 5-10 years will continue holding onto these users. Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA. Combine these 3 companies, and I see $RBLX.I'm in at $64.50 and will hold this one for 10 years. Keep buying. Keep holding.I expect RBLX to be at $140+ within 6 months."

Told ya Twitter was gonna romp you shorts. And great to see MARJ on the street corner.
Twitter’s future is not looking too bright. The creepy CEO has moved onto other business ventures—Investors should too.
"TWTR business model is too political and too risky to exist! It’s not only tanking this time! It’ll literally disappearing faster than we expect! That’s why Jack Dorsey keeps asking others to take over and uses SQ as an excuse to leave! Yes, he knew it! What a rare shorting opportunity! "
Stay SHORT!
this pump is money managers pumping it so they can collect profits in the next two weeks its heading down massively in two weeks mark my words. they shorted the entire market for two weeks now and theyre trying to lure fomo chasers in here so they can exit out with profits on this ticker. this is gonna run sideways like nvidia or tdoc after march MARK THIS POST
single digits
I know TWTR is down at the moment. Look for a spike today above $50. This is a great entry point after the mild pullback from what will become irrelevant news... GLTA
"will open on Tuesday at 39 a share, and will close at 33 a share ."
"You made a BIG mistake, Jack! TWTR may be a private company, but Americans do NOT appreciate being censored or told with whom they can or cannot communicate, especially when it comes to their elected government officials. Go back o high school and take a Citizenship class."
"Well this is fantastic, cuckoo Dorsey can now censor the news along with individuals. Unbelievable people actually support this."
It's a new week twidiots. How many more women will come forward and how many more needless deaths of seniors will be attributed to the serial womanizer and executioner of the elderly? Any guesses?

Election is over & best customer TWTR ever had is deleted--KMA.
For Basic Human Rights and Dignity! Sell Twitter!
There’s so many terrible things happening and I can’t talk to anyone about it.
Earnings call is at 6et relax libtards. Tomrorow will open at 55.
"Even a USPS truck driver announced he transferred 288,000 fraudulent ballots from New York State to Pennsylvania during the election."
"Let me just put it this way: Jeff Bezos did Jack Dorsey a favor last night by shutting down Parler. But, what they don't get, is that we're not coming back. Having nothing is better than being a patron customer of a tyrant media platform that deems whatever it wants unacceptable and kicks it out of the public forum. And, hey Jack, you can check my Twitter account. I really did deactivate it! And, Parler or not, I'm not coming back."
I am looking to reach 65 to 68 in my short!
"Twitter, look at the price of this stock and they do nothing. You could buy more than half the stocks on the Dow for less than this. You could also buy a real stock like Coca Cola. What is it Twitter do again? Oh right they advertise stuff, and sell their users information to third-parties. That's their entire business model..."
Not quick enough yahoo...eat a bag also....
MyPillow CEO banned!!! Did he say a prayer or something?
Tomorrow 66
I did removed my Twitter account!
Freedom of speech only counts if you say something good about Nancy and Joe but I can't think of any thing. My last post was deleted as usual.
Derp me no understand opex because GRU doesn’t teach Wall Street finance; says every GRU operative in the tweet deck
Social media profits are now more distributed. It was just FB ruling the roost couple couple of years back. Go Twitter!!
$ROKU Bounced off nicely from the 50dMA. Profit takers and weak hands are now flushed out. New money should be coming in and we should be heading to $500.... $TSLA bounced off nicely after a long consolidation. For ROKU RSI of 46 is quite low and I expect quick upside is in the offing..... $QQQ $NFLX $AAPL $QS $SQ $TWTR $UBER
"Users blah blah blah blah, when you get the point that this business not about users quantity but content quality Twitter will be $100"
"Now there is a concerted buying pattern to stop the bleed (11:35 AM EST). With support at $58, this looks artificial (a stock price 'prop'). Time will tell ..."
"Remember this date, and remember MKM partners with an upgrade. This stock is currently trading at $47.90 as I write this. Remember this over the next 3-4 quarters when their earnings come out, and they show a mass exodus."
"Been waiting to short social media for so long you have no clue. I've been off it for 5 years and think it is the number 1 cause to all the deceit, hate, and division in this world. Along with all the media outlets"

"There was very few and little attention paid to the months of riots and violence all summer from the left. No interest at all. Now democratic law makers describe what happened last week as a Coup d'état. If this was an attempted Coup d'état, they should take some lessons from the rioters in Oregon. Taking selfie’s while you protest doesn’t seem the way to go."
predictions after earnings report? have at it
Big money bringing you in saying safe and cheap. Then the shorts will drop the hammer as institutional investors bail out. Be smart. Twit deleted millions of accounts. They will not come back. A generation gone. You think there is a future? It’s over. It will now be an echo chamber of movie stars doing selfies and politicians talking to nobody who believes them. The party is over and Jack doesn’t care about the investors only about his handlers. CHINA ￼￼
I already deleted my account.
Jack Dorsey for man of the year!He silenced the orange overload!
apparently companies don't care about stock value. and more about politics. This should be grounds for delisting if they do not work as exclusively to be more profitable and grow. NOT minimize growth.
"My fellow free speech friends, I am calling it a day. Have some work to do. Everybody have a great night, because tomorrow brings another day. Should be interesting what President does, as well as Nancy. How will TWTR stock hold up? Again, as posted all depends on big institutions. Enjoy your evening GODBLESS THE USA"
Only Twitter picks the day off a major market reversal to rally. I hate this stock.
Sell your Twitter shares and buy a stake in the My Pillow company!!
"I would like to see Twitter Fall dramatically. But, the money managers are not going to allow it to day. It is an expiration day for options; weekly options. I think Twitter will stay level. Because it is being Artificially been held up."

"DROPPING nicely. Slow drip, day by day."
Never seen such blatant pump or is it insider news?
Fly Birdie Fly! Tweet Tweet Baby;)
Twitter should go back to what it does best - telling the world about the cute thing your cat just did.
Lets get this down past $40 by close. 20$ by the end of the week. Twitter cant sustain itself on just koolaid hair socialists.
Parler available on shortwave radio and on your AM dial 610 from 3am to 6am.
Twitter has already has estimated lost over 2.6 billion in revenue from banning Trump due to the massive amount of followers he had made your bed now lay in itthats just from his account not counting the fall out from other that are leaving twitter. Facebook and Twitter have already lost together 51billion in market valuesee what happens when you are a platform supposedly designed for everyone and you think got to big for you pants and and control with your bias opinions
Is it good time to start a position ?
Watch for the closing hour of trading. Don't hold this over the 3 day holiday weekend leading to the inauguration.

Twitter will be forced to submit to the federal government. This censorship has gone on far too long!
"Shorting this from now on. It should be and must be an opportunity to express yourself. Freedom of speech? I think Twitter lost their core daily user by this move. We all know that what he/other did was wrong, but come on... Norway."
"I'm already shorting Facebook, have been doing it since Monday when I said so here. BUT when we are finished screwing Twitter over, we should do the same to Facebook. It's time to strike back. First things first though. Let's do Twitter good and proper..."

"Voltaire said, “I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”I applauded as a shareholder from high 20s of the tool to be a great platform for a common man. But with it's recent actions, the firm trampled on one of the most basic tenets of democracy while enjoying the public protection through FCC policies. I am sorry to my part-time CEO. Due to that reason--as Mr. Wonderful on Shark Tank says, ""I am out!"". BOL.PS: With bi*** coin going the way it is, I might as well pull my funds from SQ too. I can't rely my businesses on firm that is risking my funds on unreliable bitcoin strategies. Sorry again Mr. Part-time CEO. I will be out there too."

"45 people, eyes on the prize..."
I will do everything in my power this year to get my friends to move to another conservative alternative from Twitter and FB. Their censorship is outrageous.
$10.00 by April.
You longs are welcome. I held this for 2-3 at $35 cost and twtr couldn’t seem to get out of its own way. I sold at $54.50 early jan and I knew the moment I sold it would go to $70
Isn't it about time for Tramp Stamp Brenda to show up and attempt to pump TWTR to over $50/shr?

"Had Twitter stocks for the last 12 months but I’ll be selling my 10.000 shares today at the opening. I don’t want to own a company that is biased and is limiting the freedom of speech, that’s just over the limits for me."
On Oct 29 2020 TWTR stock lost 25% on a bad news. W/O any big change or improvements they inched there way back up with a 2G stock buyback. Now don't expect them to get out of this one. The TWTR platform was a big part of that on going disastrous vicious political game. You can't eat your cake and have it. It's time for them to pay for their greedy irresponsible behavior. Early this week many will start to keep their distance from TWTR and the stock price will fall hard and fast
Twitter is the next MySpace.

Couldn't happen to a nicer company unless it was Facebook (D.A.R.P.A) or Google (C.I.A)
I quit using twitter and faceboowk-now my data is harder to congregate and analyze-it's harder to pinpoint what kind of consumer I amI don't have to see people I barely know - bragging about how great they are.I don't have to get the political opinions of people I don't know
Also Twitter now has an antitrust lawsuit pending with their collusion with Amazon to get rid of a competitor...
Why is my comment about Nancy P gone?
"There's short-term downward pressure, but their most likely competition just got knee-capped by Amazon AWS dropping them for their participation in the recent insurrection. Eventually, people will move on."
You can make an awful lot of money in the market by investing in companies which embittered right-wing reactionaries denounce.

Free ride to 60 soon. Check that gap baby.
"Hate speech is dangerous, and if it leads to violence a private enterprise could be held liable. That being said, there is another danger here - what is considered hate speech? If you listen to the media, anything said by Republicans or conservatives is deemed hate speech. There is clearly an effort to silence opposition by the left here."

Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can."
soon the lawyers will file class action lawsuits against twitter for direct actions of the ceo not in the best interest of the shareholders and causing damage to the share price....

Iran making death threat to the USA on TWTR. Twitters response: it doesn’t violate our community standards...
"News: Joe is having every single one of the 25,000 National Guard troops vetted, just in case any of them are conservatives. That's extreme and show how afraid the man is. They are totally paranoid. Did Joe win the election? Clearly no."
"Dorsey: “So, the focus is certainly on this account [@realDonaldTrump] and how it ties to real world violence. But also, we need to think much longer term around how these dynamics play out over time. I don’t believe this is going away anytime soon.”Dorsey: “You know, the U.S. is extremely divided. Our platform is showing that every single day.”"

Best short stock of 2021
Trunp claims total control of the GQP. There we have it. Cult.
The Industrial Revolution happened with almost play by play mirror image as this big tech revolution is happening. In the history of the industrial revolution 100% of the leaders of that circumstance are now considered evil men. Supporters of Twitter are very short sighted.
5 billion lawsuit coming lol
Half of twitters revenue and followers came from Trumps and conservatives. Ouch that's gonna hurt.

Losing today $$ Again Jack ?? LMAO Bankrupt Soon
Frightened rightwingers who want to overturn elections in order to install an orange monarch have no idea how improved the twitter platform has become minus the treason. Of course the valuation is on the rise.

"To the powers that be, @jack the CEO of twitter is purposely throwing away customers. His first obligation, as the CEO of a public company, is to the shareholders. Last time I checked, throwing away customers is not revenue producing.The Board of Directors of Twitter should fire @jack because he has lost his mind."
CrazyI dropped FB and Twitter and I find myself doing more productive things! Sad how addictive I was to them!
"TWTR, No profit, no dividend, no Federal Income Taxes paid. Declining mDAUs and growing competition. So, again, I should invest in this company because........."
Whoever is buying this stock is throwing their money away. $30 by their earnings. Almost a 50% drop in a month. It will keep dropping from there.
How do you unify with a communist?
Twitter to start charging people to use their services? Run for the hills!
Looks like a nice AH bull trap to me
Dow down 600 points today. And that is just the first 10 Executive Orders by Biden.
Sell sell sell. Get out now folks. Writing on the wall. Twitter is done!
Hey guys we have to show these guys that you can not go against the wil of the people. Close your accounts and put them out of business.
Done with Twitter. These social media companies just went down a rabbit hole from which there is no escape.
"Twatter is just completing the chart formation of a classic head and shoulders move, once that right shoulder is formed it will tank massively"
Any American company that is against free speech should drummed out of America and your stock should be worth no more than 2 cents a share. Next up is Amazon and Google. I have reduced all my business dealings with them as of today and will have all associates follow. Remember 75 million customers don't agree with the Socialist Communist agenda the Democrats are putting into effect.

"JIM COLLINS Jan 15, 2021 | 11:45 AM ESTStocks quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good!"
Good bye Jack.

"As some point, we all need to realize that as a country we are better than what Twitter is representing. There are many great companies to trade and make nice money on like the EV stocks.

I personally have never seen child pornography on twitter lol. this is a plain and simple attempt to censor free speech in an authoritarian country."
Twitter is going downhill fast
what's the dividend on twitter?

"Can someone explain why anyone should own Twitter stock not trade but own. With a 45 BILLION dollar market Cap, 2% inside ownership (who sell every time they convert their cheap options), loosing money hand over fist, loosing users even faster. The only way Vanguard, Morgan, and Block Rock can get out is on a sale and I assure you no one is paying these prices. I expect a rise in 4th quarter top line numbers with increased losses based on higher over head and a huge legal bill. I also expect first quarter will be dismal at best and their cash position to be dwindling. I think eventually this trade back to the 52 week lows of $20 per share. If I'm wrong so be it but I would like to here a bullish reason to own TWTR."
It will be 50% down after next earnings.

Think about a subscription model, 33% chance it is a success, 67% chance it doesn't take hold.

TWTR is now DOWN by 13% since Mon. -- a loss of $5.2 BILLION in market cap. The stock could easily drop to the $20's where it traded last June. Look out below!

I am most concerned with the forward looking statements ... hard to buy when the business almost guarantees a loss AND slower user growth. What do you think?
"The brand new Birdwatch program is doomed to fail as people will not want their posts ""cancelled"" by incredibly biased left-wing radials. This new policy will only motivate millions of conservatives to leave Twitter. The blue bird has been injured in recent weeks and is desperately trying to save itself from a financial catastrophe. Too little, too late."
this company has never made money is not a growth company. We get banned in several countries. Not looking good!
Up 120% since last August. Stock price 16x sales/share. Negative EPS. Profit margin -31%. ROE - 14%. Revenue $3.7 Bil . Book Value $10/share. Market Cap $68 Bil ? This stock is pumped up to moon?
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out censorship. Makes sense.

Just wondering about all of the beloved Twitter investors. Did anyone let you know they would sabotage the company and destroy well over 5 billion in shareholder value? Just wondering why you care about a company that doesn’t care for you? Maybe you are all staying around for the dividend o wait yeah. They most really care about the stock holder.

I am enjoying finding new online sites and small shops in my area. I have found EVERYTHING online that I had with Amazon. When I deleted my Amazon account there was a subscription box that I gave up, but I found it online direct from the company. I guess I just assumed you had to go through Amazon to get a lot of the things I had bought off of Amazon. I am having a grand time finding new places to get my goods so this has actually been a good thing. The only thing I am still missing is Parler. I hope they come back! There isn't another social media site online like them that I can find yet. I liked the whole design of their site and all the many people I met on there. I have Gab and ChatDit and Rumble and I don't miss Youtube. I am SORRY though for all the creators on there that are losing money by people deleting their accounts or not watching YouTube. I hope all my favorite creators move to Rumble or the other free speech video sites and I can find them soon."

Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reason of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come in their presence.""-- Frederick Douglas"
This is a $20 stock.
This is going up for no reason
Regardless of them actually being publishers how can anyone invest in a stock that is run by Jack.

"Ditch Twitter. Ditch Google. Ditch Facebook. BUT ESPECIALLY GOOGLE/YOUTUBE. If you must watch Youtube make sure you have adblock on so you they don't get any advertising revenue from pumping ads at you every 5 minutes. Ditch AT&T if you can, that's Google/Youtube again."

Twitter should be a $30 stock before the end of the this month. They just lost half of their users LOL
"44's Tuesday, lower it goes faster it depreciates. Trick is to get as many bag holders on way down to cushion bottom."
"Don't forget that while Twitter was declaring a loss of over $7 Million in QE2 2020, they were busy handing $10 Million away to BLM. The SEC should drag them over the coals just for tha, because basically by handing away the shareholders money, drove the company into making a loss."
Someone tried like heck to prop $TWTR up at close. Tomorrow will be fun day to watch!
It must be great being a company that makes no money!
I have a $50000 bet that this is trading at $20 in a year.

He just texted me to say he's made money already this morning, but that he'll be out of this before the market opens. lol Ah well, I wouldn't risk losing 10c on this garbage. But if he can do it, then fine. Just don't get caught holding this when the market closes..."

There's no denying it now --- TWTR is the digital era equivalent of book burning.
This is going to get bad. TWTR is going to suffer. Should we sell before the dump really takes place?Any thoughts?

"Heading over to parlou-r to get important updates and announcements. Nope just vitriol and hate Heading over to gab to get important announcements and updates. No, just junkHeading over for telegram to hear about weather updates and important local bulletins. Oh, no not hereTwitter has all these things. And responses from local people adding critical information. I guess that’s why it’s publicly traded and well and used by every outlet to broadcast critical information. If you have a steamy barf filled story, maybe one of the Wests can lend you some channel time."
I didn't need to delete my Twit account since I never had one.

Top Conservative Leader Tom Fitton Is Still Suspended by Twitter 7 Days After a 7 Day Suspension for Tweeting the Truth on HCQ
I wonder if snuckerburg loan twit bitter some cash from all the shares he has been selling. They are probably trying to stabilize the downward spiral.
Stock keeps going up even though right-wingers encourage people to cancel their accounts. That makes me hopeful.
"Saw a job post the other day: $10-12 an hour. Bachelors degree and 3-5 years experience required. To work at a coffee shop. I’m thinking there’s a disconnect if people are going to be asked to have a degree to work the point of sale. It makes Twitter marketing and only fans look more lucrative. If you’re going to buy a house, you can’t do it with some gop offering you $10 an hour for a register job. Minimum wage at $20,000. If rent is 600, and food is 200 a week, you’re out of money."
Booom short depressed
"RIP twitter, it was fun while it lasted."
It looks like we are heading to $50/share by April. Then $40/share by May.

"TWTR employees support cancel culture. How sick. TWTR supports people who posts hate and violence on their app. Look at people like John McAfee a former big tech CEO. He can post anything he wishes and TWTR doesn't bat an eye against one of their own. He frequently posts about drugs, gun violence, and alcohol and yet you can follow him on TWTR."
"the joke is teewter, down big after the ER, and i love it"

"Enjoy this message board while you can...Yahoo shut down their message board that covers daily news stories, AOL is blocking all conservative posters and Face Book is deleting conservative posts...It's only a matter of time before Yahoo completely shuts down free speech....."
Anyone started shorting from 55 all the way down to 45 today ?
"There should be a class action suit against CNN. John Sullivan left activist was with Jade Sacker of CNN inside the Capitol before the rioters and he is on tape encouraging them to riot. As they come through the front door she says on videotape we did it. No you, we did and gives him a hug. Who knew about the plot to spark the riot. That led to Twitter blaming the President and removing his account, which set off a fire storm of Big Tech and free speech leading to the incredible drop in this stock. This is a huge story about CNN involvement."
"My business boarded up a lot of windows in downtown Chicago when the riots started .Who wants to live like that ? And pay employees over 45.00 per hour , and pay high taxes ?You liberal that voted for joe just watch the jobs numbers the next 4 years"

I am thinking of buying a new house maybe in Florida or Montana. I'll call it the TwitShort house.
Dive !!! Dive !!! just like a submarine...

Which side would Twitter have chosen in the Revolutionary War? Would it have mattered?
"Congrats to all longs for holding strong. Glad to see the boycott cult have only made this stronger. Have to admit, I was a little nervous, but clearly they are not the ones using Twitter. Twitter is a lot more peaceful now "
"With the billions joe's wasting on his protection today he could have build a wall from sea to shining sea along the southern border..But it's too late there's a 100,000 migrants on their way to America.Just in time for Joe's free food stamps, healthcare, housing and stimulus checks for everyone...."
Mayday mayday! Twitter will crash soon! Sell! This is not a joke!
"Make sure you guys deactivate your twitter accounts before you uninstall the app from your phone. It's for the better. Nike, just do it"
No one likes Jack Dorsey...not even the hard core Dems...truly.
Going to Crash
It's time to sell. Going down with Twitter will be the same as going down with titanic.
"Make Twitter a billion dollar company. Dump them and dump the stock. When they reach a billion like Parler, we will protest outside google and Apple until they take the app off their app stores."

Will be a sinking ship getting out now
"I just got suspended by Youtube for expressing my opinions which someone flagged for review and didn't like. Have been with them for many years and nothing like this ever happened. Didn't post any outright ""hateful"" things just the truth in a polite manner. Maybe it's a good thing because I may have been spending too much time posting on their site. Have cancelled my Facebook account many years ago because I came to the conclusion that I don't need to ""friend"" people just for the sake of ""friending"" people. I like my privacy and have no desire to re-connect with people from my past and give day by day reports as to what I'm doing with my life. Was never on Twitter at all and have no intention to being on there."
"Whomever doesn't think Treasury yields and inflation are soon to take a step up, let me know. That gaggle of noted economists could be wrong in the way they are looking at printing 1.9T more $$$ adding to the national debt, treasury issuing more bonds to cover ... and zero announced new taxes.Help me there, if we can just print money, why can't we just print money to cover our taxes? Note: Said with a hint of sarcasm knowing the Federal Reserve is a private bank and our taxes go to pay the shareholders ..."
"How many insurrectionists did the 25,000 National Guardsmen have to put down during St Joe's inaugural event?"
"When social media companies limit free speech, then the smart thing is to stop using them! Just go back to using your phone and actually call someone and talk. You get to hear their voice and laugh with them and it's much more fun and personal. Ditch these companies that want to limit free speech and control the flow of ideas and thought that they disagree with. At this rate we dont have to worry about the Russians or the Chinese meddling in our personal affairs, you've got these multibillion social media companies that are doing a much better job at it!!"
