Recent headlines and conversations for TWTR
"There was very few and little attention paid to the months of riots and violence all summer from the left. No interest at all. Now democratic law makers describe what happened last week as a Coup d'état. If this was an attempted Coup d'état, they should take some lessons from the rioters in Oregon. Taking selfie’s while you protest doesn’t seem the way to go."
Sell this stock. Save freedom
Sold mine. No going back. BTW JD also has SQUARE (SQ).
"Twitter is run at a loss, makes no money, and YET hands away $10 Million to BLM without even consulting the shareholders... Don't trust Dorsey. He has to go."

"Drop it under 45 for 45, let's do it."
It's no accident the CEO looks a like Carl Marx. One thing in the U.S.A is we as American's can invoke Capital Markets punishment on the Stock by Selling TWTR to Bankruptcy which indeed will occur over the Next 6 months when it's only major client and voice of the last four years leaves. It was going to happen anyway their was no way that Trump Organization would not be setting up it's own media networks day's after the President left office anyway. The CEO of TWTR knew that and so did we. The U.S. Capital Markets will invoke justice on TWTR. Then they will get it!
"Deruumpp may need to file unemployment to get $2,000/mo from new government. Due to double-impeachment he may not get pension & other benefits. :-)"
Do People understand that other countries are shutting down TWTR?
Make him pay!!! this is still a free country! Let them know
if it gets bellow 1 dollar it will get delisted
We got a leaker!

No surprise it's big institutions that are keeping the share price up
I pray that this stock goes to zero. That is what I would call social Justice.
TWTR suspended the my pillow CEO account permanently. Twter will be doom when Parler come back online.
"CLOSE Twitter, FB, Amzon and Apple accounts. Support Freedom Of Speech."
"Never seen a business that thought getting rid of half their customers overnight was a good idea. I wouldn't do business with people that think that way. Makes me think Twitter doesn't care or need money. Probably run by the CIA to control speech and keep and eye on all the citizens, same with facebook."
"All the FANG stocks are down. Just the start, keep shorting. Ka-Ching!"
Full circle is coming for some of the largest businesses in our country imo. Many businesses like Twitter have become social justice warriors shifting away from corporate values that focus on social welfare and environment. This is a big mistake. Politics don't sell. The consumer always has the last word.
Ban twitter
"Communist China media like TWTR, GOOG, AAPL, FB thinks nothing happened."

A good time to short. Stock will be going down all this week at least
Good luck trying to ban free speech. Boycott twitter start a new platform!
The fear has spread. What would you do as an investor?
Dump twitter. Stop doing business with companies that use twitter.
"Twitter announced today that they acquired Revue, a tiny private company located in the Netherlands that has 6 employees, that's right- 6 employees. It is reasonable to assume that this start-up firm is bleeding red ink and welcomed a buyer before it was forced to declare bankruptcy (remember, the majority of small businesses fail). If Revue is the reason Twitter is up today, it is a ludicrous reaction, and a temporary upward moment as Twitter's negative fundamentals have not changed."
Couldn't dump my stock fast enough
Lenin would have made a great Ceo for Twitter
I give Twiter a month and it will be $ 35- $ 38
FLY FLY FLY. is this the next stonk ? my opinion
"The thing is, Twitter and Facebook are selling your PERSONAL INFORMATION to anyone who will give them money. Aren't you afraid? I know I am. That's where the data leaks begin, that's where the fraud begins, that's where someone steals your id. Just who has your information now? You don't know. No one does. Twitter and Facebook sold you."
Hope this stock crashes!!!!!
You are protection first amendment by shorting this #$%$
Dorsey for Treason. Twitter going to ZERO
How many other countries want to block twitter after the past year!
What is the point of Twitter if all it's good for is censoring people
"This company, if you want to call it that, is old news and will soon be trading on the Pink Open Market. Facebook will also follow the downward trend. Get out will you can."
"It's time to sell Twitter has a negative income 1,466,000,000. Anyone holding is going to lose both your freedom and your hard earned dollars."
"It's Friday, January 15, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
"Alec Baldwin is temporarily suspending his acct because of issues when is wife made statements on her acct ,that raised questions about whether they were truthful or not. He's been getting hassled ever since then. Love it when the liberals feast on themselves"
Jack....I bet you would like to talk with all these investors. Anyone know an app where he can do that open and free. Someone should design one. LoL.
nice short
Bye Bye Twitter....I would say it was nice knowing you but I would be lying!
"Day Traders, why are you still holding this? You have 10 minutes, before it collapses in AH with people trying to ditch it in a hurry,"
I'm changing my price Target from $5 to $0. Sorry for the confusion I was being a little bit optimistic. 
Look for the Sherman Act to be used against big tech. The leadership should also be sued when shares tank.
Start using alternative tech and media that protects freedom of speech and ideas.. Make twitter and facebook obsolete. They aren't the only show in town.
"$10 Billion gone, I don't think BLM will be getting handed $10 Million this year."
"According to the Associated Press, Defense and National Guard officials found that violent rioters coordinated their plans to storm the Capitol Building in part on Twitter, a platform that often silences conservatives under the false pretense of preventing violence."
TWTR Short sellers are American Heros.
should reach new 52 week high by end of week. definitely trending upwards. green today and ah. great job twitter you the man Dorsey
good entry point ... that is if you want to lose half of your money!
No keystone pipeline is killing American jobs. Is it a coincidence that Warren Buffett owns Burlington Northern and just purchased 850 000 shares of rail stocks added to his 53 million. If it doesn't flow thru a pipe it has to go by rail. I wonder how much he donated to the Dumbocrats. Hey lefties you have been duped and it is just starting.
@jackFear the stormNobody playing the game gets a free pass. Nobody.Q￼
Get ready to leave this platform...pay-off all your debt with TWTR short. Parler will win antitrust suit.
George Orwell was right
As it now appears the titans of MSM/SocialMedia together with the DeepState/Socialist/Marxist/Globalist cabal have won. No other reason to explain the Orwellian stock of Twtr to rise other than that. But 1st impressions can be misleading. It's either a Republic or an arm of the CCP.
"again today, will drop faster than a side of beef chucked into a van"
It’s all over for twitter!
Another 3% down with higher volume. Institutions selling off for the bagholders????
"Dumped Twitter! I have now Telegram and very happy, like other 500 milion active users."
"I bet Dorsey was so relieved at the end of the day from holding TWTR up all day, throwing so much money at it so it wouldn't go below $45. He's thinking, I got time, it's a 3 days weekend."
China is elated knowing that now the wealth transformation will resume after it was halted for 3 years
"Jack Dorsey should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, Thank Jack a million times."
Liberals are celebrating conservatives being censored.....People celebrated censorship in Germany 1933...
FALLING KNIFE -- NOW GO CATCH IT
"MySpace fell because there was no user base when FB came online. They lost their user base. Same thing happening with $TWTR. Lost a bunch of users and hasn't been profitable.I, on the other hand, have profited off their options. They will make lots of money while they tank"
Do you realize that Dorsey committed fraud in lying to Congress. As info from O'Keefe goes against what he said under sworn testimony. Can't wait for O'Keefe's next drop.
So many People on various social media sites announced they have deleted TWTR. This is not going to show up on TWTR's financials for another 2 quarter.
Good news now is that you don't need to repeal Section 230 as Twtr just imploded.
I’m a buyer at $7
Twitter and FB are ENEMIES of America.Stop them before they DESTROY the Liberty and Freedom of Great American Republic.
Surprised people are still holding this stock $TWTR $FB $AMZN $AAPL at this time and at these prices.
Twitter should go back to what it does best - telling the world about the cute thing your cat just did.
Jake is going to have to start up Dominion to make numbers work on the ER
Buy this stock and you're supporting communism at its finest PERIOD!
"Joe has Sundowners Syndrome, by 5 pm he'll have wandered off somewhere."
It's not over until it's in the pink slips..
Sell your shares. This company is never going to turn a profit under the current management team.
Guys save your money here and go buy pillows. Mikey Lindell needs your help now that he’s been deplatformed at Kmart.
I canceled my Twtr account and Facebook.
"biden will be forgotten pretty quickly , trump will be remembered for a long long time"
Hope this goes to 40 next week.
"libs on wall street will try to prop this up in the short term. but, long term they can't stop the drop. having no dissenting views will only make things worse, not better."
"Mike Flynn and Sydney Powell also banned. Gab is getting 10,000 people an hour signing up. Go to gab!"
Don't put it past Dorsey and his brown shirts to doctor and fudge the viewership and member numbers next Q
great job twitter today you the man Dorsey
"TWTR is finish ,watch."
I too have disbanded from Twitter and also Facebook due to self absorbing censorship! Selling all shares of stock.
Don’t hold a share
Sean is Nancy Pelosi.
"Go to YouTube account ""The White House"" and look at the like and dislikes for the first videos of the most popular administration in American history"" LMAO"
I have been banned on this #$%$ app for almost a year and I would never buy the stock!
I guess America not too happy with CCP corporate governance
"Kind of fun watching this anti-American company continuing its nosedive. When you effectively ban or insult half of the country, that is what should happen."
It's been a few years now and I've almost given up hope. I mailed a generous donation check to the Dennison Foundation because I believed in their fine work with Children's Cancer Centers and Disabled Veterans Groups but have yet to receive my Dennison University diploma in the mail.I'm beginning to think I've been bigly had. Opinions? I'm thinking of hiring Rudy Giuliani to sue on my behalf.
"What is twitter?? - ""Said every single person in 1 year"" :)"
The bleed to $15 has started.
Send Jack Dorsey to the capitalist gulag of bankruptcy!
"Twitter officially banned the hashtag #1984 this week, Think about it."
"Over 10,000 of my followers on Twitter disappeared since last weekend. Their accounts are completely gone, if you click through to them. I will ALSO be deleting my account end of the week, just keeping it open for now to monitor the drift of people OFF THE PLATFORM. Not posting any tweets now. BOTTOM LINE IS THEY'VE GONE, and most of them were not political people."
I bet the stock is down at least 10% tomorrow.
Wait for the morning lull in about an hour. It will show no mercy as this stock plummets and NEVER recovers. Half the users are gone now. The advertisers will also walk away. Twitter has no business model.
You know that feeling when you have to go #2 really bad and then the relief when you actually go? Thats the same feeling I got when I deleted my Twitter account.
"Wonder if Twitter/FB will “fact” check this.Copied from a friend:2p.m. yesterday marked Biden's 50th hour in office, here's where we're at: today-8 Chinese bombers, 4 fighters, and 1 sub- hunter just breached Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone, crossing the Taiwan Strait.- a loss of 52,100 jobs in oil.- ended energy independence for the United States.- Canada suing Biden.- Antifa ( just an idea right) continue to riot and burn down Portland and Seattle.- sent our troops that were in D.C. to sleep on the floor of a parking garage, in freezing temperatures, with cars there and one bathroom, but the WH made them cookies.- created a new glass ceiling for girls to hurdle, ruining so many chances for scholarships with his "" progressive "" transgender programs allowing boys to compete against girls.- created a new federal property mask mandate, which he broke countless times already.- is now allowing illegal immigrants to be counted for representation in congress.- he shot down a Trump administration order to lower the cost of insulin.- he shot down a Trump administration order to lower the cost of epinephrine.- Rescinds Trump order banning Chinese Communist involvement in U.S. power grid.- rescinds 401k contributions being tax deductible for many Americans ( a huge disguised tax hike )- $1.6 billion in gross wage losses.Everything he's done in the first 3 days has benefited other countries and hurt Americans.But Hey, at least he hasn't tweeted mean words."
"Twitter reported a loss of $7.44 Million in March, but at the same time handed $10 Million to BLM. Can anyone explain that? How can you allow these reckless people to handle your money. You got no dividend, Twitter reported a loss, but BLM got handed $10 Million."
Sell today! This will drop fast! Not a joke
Twitter is going down!
$38 is next level of support! Come on patriots we can smash through that by EOD!
"Bubba Clinton says: ""Shorting Twitter is more fun than a weekend on Epstein's island."""
"Russian President Putin on big tech today: ""They serve or restrict the natural human right to decide how to live, what to choose, which position to express freely, we just saw all of these in the states, and everyone understands what I'm talking about"""
Just sold my shares of Twitter and Facebook and cancelled my accounts too.
"When social media companies limit free speech, then the smart thing is to stop using them! Just go back to using your phone and actually call someone and talk. You get to hear their voice and laugh with them and it's much more fun and personal. Ditch these companies that want to limit free speech and control the flow of ideas and thought that they disagree with. At this rate we dont have to worry about the Russians or the Chinese meddling in our personal affairs, you've got these multibillion social media companies that are doing a much better job at it!!"
Can you imagine Twitter with just Liberals and democrats? It would be similar to a modern day Clan meeting...
Goodbye twitter-Talk about being unamerican.By the way Twitter here come the shorts and you deserve every bit of it.
"For the first time in my life I've shorted a stock this week. And when it briefly climbed, shorted it again! TWTR is in a graveyard spiral, and I intend to ride it all the way to the ground. I'm up $250 so far. You don't deny the duly-elected President of The United States free speech!"
10% or 15% down in the AM ? Or 20% plus
A Twitter short is free money. Good for the soul too.
dorcey can........
Fund managers at vanguard and others are having meetings on how far they will let Twitter go backwards before they bail ! Most were in before 20.00 When this happens look out
"Don't overlook this. The deactivation of all the highest profile conservative accounts will also result in a severe reduction of progressive counterpoint reactions. It's a severe traffic killer and a double whammy against TWTR.The stock may get propped up in the short term, but paraphrasing Titanic, ""The ship will sink. It is a mathematical certainty."""
Jack Dorsey gave $10 million to a race indoctrinator for the sole purpose of poisoning the minds of young children. This is one of the many faces of your enemy and mine.
Parler is back on-line—soon to be fully operable. . .
"Even till today we can witness the dangerous power deep pocket techs has over society and other businesses, including manipulative “upgrade” reports."
"You want to see an insurgency, come try to take away my free speech and guns. At 70 years old I would rather die then see my children and grandchildren lose these rights. I will fight with my last breath to defend these rights."
"Dow Futures are down more than 300 points, which highly indicates the DOW will be down for 5 consecutive days. The sleeping Bear has arisen and the Bull has been killed, all thanks to the disastrous executive orders of Uncle Joe. I guess elections really do have consequences."
I was having a bad morning. then I noticed that TWTR is still nose diving. God bless America!
"Capital has not ethics but I do, as a person. Won’t invest in it, regardless."
COME ON 'E REDS!
look like big tech forget who put them in this level WE THE PEOPLE now WE THE PEOPLE can take you down i sold my stocks in apple and canceled my Amazon account Facebook account Twitter account block my Google app now I use duckduckgo no more apple brand in my home Doble standard company's.
Who is going to sign up for twatter ??
I am now in great company. I too have been permanently suspended from Twitter.. Welcome to the club Mr. President. See you on Parler.
"Was a Financial Principal of a NASD firm. Do not be surprised that the assumption TWTR will collapse Monday doesn't happen to the degree it should. The bad news is money will be pouring in to support the price of the stock. The good news is the SEC has the buyer information that can be traced back to the monies who purchased the stock. Also, the NASDQ should collapse based on their many abuses of our freedoms. Again don't be surprised if it initially doesn't happen."
Can't wait to see Donnie on trialin the senate and in the federal and state courts.
"I think Twitter is by design a hateful ‘ website’ , because that is all it is... a website! a system designed to use people against people."
Cancel those that cancel.
Going below 20 a share
"Amazon web services is not the only web service providers in the World. Other companies are selling web services so parler can goto Amazons competitors but parler can also build their own web servers and not rely on left wing run companies like Microsoft, Amazon etc. and therefore not need Amazon or Microsoft to flourish and then parler can ban liberal democrat companies from using its web services."
I quit using twitter and faceboowk-now my data is harder to congregate and analyze-it's harder to pinpoint what kind of consumer I amI don't have to see people I barely know - bragging about how great they are.I don't have to get the political opinions of people I don't know
"Fl Gov just ordered all Twitter, Apple and Google and AMAZON stock sold off."
"Wonder how long before the class action lawsuits start? Thanks Jack, off!"
I don’t own Twitter anymore. I’m here because I’m getting some kind of fantastic satisfaction seeing the downfall after the pent up frustrations of having the conservative voice suppressed. They all are getting what they deserve and I’m relieved.
I have a $50000 bet that this is trading at $20 in a year.
Only a communist would buy this stock now.
When does the free market realize the vulnerability of social media to their bottom line?
A good opportunity to be free of Twitter.
"Left-wing 'agitator' John Sullivan was arrested for US Capitol riot involvement released from jail without bail.Twitter allows him to keep posting, yet bans our president."
The value of Twitter has fallen so much that Twitter should settle out of court with Parler and just sign the company over to Parler.
"Keep tanking, keep shorting! Certainty is the guaranteed money!"
"In case you'rewondering, this is why the stock popped: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html"
Twitter = Enron
“Can ya spare a buck or at least a share of Twitter?
"Everything is going by the book. Twitter announced its acquisition of newsletter platform Revue two days ago, but the company has already begun to integrate the product. Another reason that Dorsey is moving on from the Trumplikins flashback..."
It's Funny people don't believe Patriots have the Power. Jack should take a good hard look at what happened to the NFL MLB NBA the last few years
"Who's buying this garbage? Twitter has become nothing more than a political campaign. This is not a company that any rational investor would want exposure to, where world leaders are coming out against it. Now you have state wide internet providers blocking bandwidth to Twitter and Facebook making it inaccessible to their users. We are are in the midst of technological warfare."
"Just today, you've seen Gen. Austin announce that the Pentagon is shifting its priorities to carry out war against ""climate change."" This treasonous act would de-prioritize America's national defense and instead focus the entire US military on an imaginary enemy that's nothing but a quack science hoax."
Declassification coming on Spygate....watch big tech try to censor...
"Since jack has shown how well his company can censor free speech, maybe the CCP will be interested in a version they can use to feed propaganda to their citizens?"
Election is over & best customer TWTR ever had is deleted--KMA.
"""You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em""Kenny Rogers Time to fold!"
Does anyone have a good company that does not censor it’s clientsOr sell their information to foreign sovereignties
"Twitter is so yesterday, the smart money is getting out when the getting is still good."
"On fox news,charles Payne business reporter , as of Sunday lost 50000 followers on his twitter account. Multiplycthus by 50 fold and you can see what will happen to twitter aka pravda. NEXT BOYCOTT of amazon brewing in light of there severance of tech support for Parler."
Block CNN MSNBC. NBC etc from your phone. I blocked all of them. I do not want any fake news from them
39 at close of market today
Haha even google search engine blocking any articles about social media fallout tomorrow!
Twitter opposes free speech. Delete your account. I have. Encourage others to do the same. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Sell your stock.
I deleted 45 fake accounts and my one real account.. I also deleted the apps from all my mobile devices..
So is this a sell? I'm hearing multiple things
@.0000001 I will wait for that price...
Ha! This thing goes to $0. Parler is over capacity tonight. This is the end of Twitter.
Twitter a growth company with no growth.
TWTR has $41 BILLION in mkt cap with just $3.6 billion in revenue. Earnings are negligible. The $52 stock price has a long way to fall. Karma.
If you really hate Jack. Stop using Square for payments! That is his golden goose!
Close your accounts people. Show these btards they can't run our lives.
"Twatter actually said this today: ""Access to information and freedom of expression, including the public conversation on Twitter, is never more important than during democratic processes, particularly elections.#UgandaDecides2021"""
True story! I was a union contractor in Chicago . I laid off over 150 democratic liberals and moved my head quarters to Florida. None union !They got pink slips January 1st !The moral of this story is liberals and unions destroy America
Chinese food will be served every weekend in the White House as per Biden
Dump twitter - the fight they are trying to fight is unsustainable and they will lose and so will shareholders
sell all the high tech
"Telegram now has over 500M users and over 25M new ones in the past 3 days. Gab has been adding servers and adding ~500K users per day. WhatsApp (Facebook) and Twitter seem to have sown the wind, now they will reap the whirlwind."
All you need to do is look at the March 19 way out of the $ Puts are all up big today and ask why? Earnings report in Feb will be a disaster when they have to disclose how many users deleted their accounts. Time is running out to get out!
Dorsey gave $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM people. Think about it. He is not on the side of shareholders.
Karen Finerman shorted TWTR today.
"Let's see, advertising will be down, so revenue will decline along with the stock value. Nice business plan."
Going down another 15 percent this coming week...
This is known as biting the hand that feeds you...10 a share by summer
CNN.....the #1 fiction show on cable TV.
"Traders who attempted to cancel the sale were met with a message telling them the sale couldn’t be undone, “as we placed it to mitigate the risk to your account.”"
Anyone who would invest in a company that eliminates free speech is not an American
Add my parler @DropShock I deleted twitter and will follow back any proud patriot that follows me.
The Communist Dems Plan
very pleased. jack dorsey is definitely making twitter great again.
This is a easy short! No brainer 38.00 easy
"There is no bottom to this stock. Everything they have done, is basically against our Constitution. Time for those who believe in this to financially support it. As far as me and my house, we deleted Facebook and Twitter. NEVER again will we allow censorship at that level. I hope they go bankrupt."
Twitter is better off being at $30 without Donald than at $50 with him. This same logic applies to our country as well.
"jack is hedging trying to hold the line with words, but the DEMs are going to let TWTR sink and use as an example for social media. Very little chart support until it hits $32- $29 range . Dont bet against the FEDs or Government"
"Will the outgoing Commander-in-Chief have a few moments today between crying jags and temper tantrums to issue a statement about the latest and greatest Russian hack of all time on American Infrastructure?""I don't see any reason why it would be Russia.""- President David ""J is for Jenius"" Dennison"
So when do all the TWTR lawsuits begin?
"a good point to ponder ---->""Why hasn’t Jack Dorsey been arrested for lying under oath about Twitter’s censorship policies?"" YET?"
FREEFALL
Bye Bye Twitter
The draining of the swamp continues in the morning . I waited 4 yrs for this.
The censorship lead ballon is dragging Jack and his “book burners” down! Sell before it’s too late!

its really nice to see investors reject TWTR and Jack Dorsey. restores a tiny piece of the faith in humanity I still have left.
"If you don’t stand up to these companies soon , it will not matter , they will restrict everyone ! Cancel them, before they cancel YOU !"
this stock will lose 15% every week for the the whole year.
I want Jimmy Carter back. At least no cell phones or social media will be involved. Just free toasters at your local bank to open a checking account at 20% interest rates.

"The stock market looks very tired, it looks like there will be a correction of 10-15%, and for TWTR still 30%-40% down."
"Remember this date, and remember MKM partners with an upgrade. This stock is currently trading at $47.90 as I write this. Remember this over the next 3-4 quarters when their earnings come out, and they show a mass exodus."
Twitter is Toast. Younger millennials don't use it. All the Trumpers have left to other app's. Attracting new users is going to be very difficult for them.

"Social media was a fun pastime, until shadowbanning and now outright banning of people. The annoyance of having your account suspended because you hurt some snowflakes feeling by using real words... like there are only 2 sexes, should have been sufficient warning that political correctness was becoming more important than reality."
Get out of here. This will go bankruptcy.
Wait for $20 or lower
Blackballed by Wall Street
Has any read the letter Nancy sent to the mayor of Portland. If you haven't google it . If this is true it shows how sleazy she is.
Defund media
jack caught by project veritas is deeply troubling... he should be removed by the board for abandoning his fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders... he actions are tanking the stock. I will be asking my mutual funds to divest as well..

Dorsey and company throwing cash at the the problem... Short!!!
Headed to under $10 bucks.
I shorted at 48.50 yesterday looking to cover for a quick trade. Think I will hold on a bitlonger since I see it falling to low 40s in the short term.

He is protecting the deep state Get read it’s all being dumped slowly Free speech wins - he’s coming after a lot more then one account Sell - deactivate - pull your adds from their platform
"Twitter, much like Facebook and Google, will eventually be taken down and break apart by the government. Us, the people, will no longer tolerate silencing freedom of speech. We’re not China!"
"soros & gang are supporting the stock, part of the deal"
Simple solution is to NEVER EVER deal or do business with ANY Liberal San Francisco Bay Area Company. Go do business with REAL American Companies
I heard Jack is cashing his stock in before it tanks?
It’s all over! Time to sell
Rush said he deactivated his Twitter account. He has 88.6 million followers. Good for him.
Breaking: democrats now for the police and against mobs.
My dog just defecated on a liberal newspaper with Jack Dorsey and Nancy Pelosi on the same page. A Double-whammy.
Why would anyone buy the stock of a company that is run by someone trying to take American rights away ?
Jack Dorsey has repeatedly lied to lawmakers about targeting conservatives for censorship.
"if this message board is proving anything, there is going to be a ton of volume in TWTR on Monday."
The sad thing is there is more free speech on these message boards than Twitter.
Dropping Twitter was the best thing of all. It seems Twitter is a hub or racist activities. Look at how much Twitter triggers violence across the globe. How many times do we need to see law enforcement post things liek we seen in Kentucky where they are the ones triggering racist activities? it is shameful for anyone who works at Twitter and contribute to global anarchy and unrest
Dumping all $TWTR and $FB stocks. Censorship=communism. No thank you.
How much has Twitter lost the last 7 trading days ?

Shorts this is your time to shine
Twitter is not only overvalued it is sinking to new lows and may not survive as cancellations are at a record level. Ad revenue will collapse as sponsors realize the audience is diminishing. If you are smart you will get out now while there is still some value left. Now before the real losses mount.

"So a company which CANNOT MAKE A PROFIT and lost money in 2020, while handing away $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM, is priced this high? You're kidding me. Twitter = Enron."
"Based on the Project Veritas video and Dorsey's arrogance toward the American people, I will be shorting his stocks (Twit and Square) until they are out of existence. You like cancel culture Jack? You will see how it works when money cancels you. I urge all stockholders to do the same. Let's show Jack who is really in charge."
"Sold a big position of this garbage today, and closed two accounts with significant followers. I refuse to invest or be part of an anti-american company that likes to play god-mode with our democracy."

"people need to sell Twitter shares to send a message, I sold all mine. They shut down thousands of peoples accounts. Why shut down Democrat walk away account, makes no sense. As a Democrat I have the right to express and share why I don’t want to be a communist￼"
"Hate speech is dangerous, and if it leads to violence a private enterprise could be held liable. That being said, there is another danger here - what is considered hate speech? If you listen to the media, anything said by Republicans or conservatives is deemed hate speech. There is clearly an effort to silence opposition by the left here."

"the big suits will try to prop it up at opening, but it wont help and by the end of Tuesday it will be down another 4 to 5 dollars a share."
Ask yourself after twitter becomes all democrats who are they going to argue with. Most people would get on there to argue. The amount of time spent on twitter will go down for even democrats.
So is how does Dorsey plan to spin his new user count next earnings? Maybe he is hoping for chinese customers.
Joe signed another EO to sell our power grids to China. Why does Joe hates Americans so much?
"My Twitter account is frozen because I am a conservative. Millions are also frozen.Twitter will not allow any of us to close our accounts. We all moved to GAB and other platforms yet Twitter keeps our frozen accounts 'open' (although we cannot tweet, comment, change our profile or even cancel our account) to make it appear they still have that many active users.They are faking the amount of users by holding these petrified account as 'open.The company is a fraud and the stock price will plummet far further once the true number of lost users is revealed.Sell."
Can’t stop a stock that wants to go down
"I think I'm going to exit all my TWTR positions. After scrolling through my (mostly right leaning) people I follow, many are reporting they are down 70k - 110k followers each day since this weekend. I suspect a mass exit for the door in the near future. It was great while it lasted!"
The market is now an illusion. Propped up because those who control don't want it collapsing on their watch. Wait...wait....wait...and see what happens! Just saw a tape from a witness to the fact that Rosenstein created a dirty crimes division with......Shawn Henry.....Crowdstrike. So many horrific individuals tied to companies in the US.
"Facebook, Twitter are titanic MONOPOLIES with BILLIONS OF DOLLARS of PROFITS (DISPOSABLE INCOME) that State goverments and the US government need. Democrats can create a new social networking tax that starts at 20% and increases up to 90% for the social networking companies that are monopolies like FB and Twitter . The billions in taxes the state and local goverments collect will do alot of good for the people."
I read millions of users are leaving Twitler
The Twitter supporters here realize that through this shareholders lawsuit settlement Dorsey had to give up all rights of control over the company right? Worst company of 2021 easily.
"Last chance to sell before the ""Plunge"""
Censorship does not pay. I guess Twitter going to learn the hard way.

"80 million Trumpster gone to other platforms. Trumpsters' liberal opposition follow them to the other platforms to harass. So, 75% of TWTR activity gone. The best part is that 4,900 TWTR employees join the homeless on the streets of San Francisco. Trumpsters win in the long run."
all controversial decisions aside Is this co being run in a legally & fiscally manner beneficial to its shareholders?
"look at options today, oh boy"
Hoping to get some short action tomorrow on Twitter. But I can’t trade pre mkt have to wait til 9:30. Futures already down bigly this could be the thing that brings stock market bull run to its knees

Twitter still not admitting that the Hunter Biden laptop story was accurate and there are still tons of active posts about the farcical 'Russian Collusion' narrative they pushed for 4 years .

"DC is under martial law. So much for the land of the free. If we ever want to be free again, we may have to assert that right..."
I mean seriously anyone losing big money here and over the next four years. What were you all thinking anyway. There is no Capital Markets and Wealth from Capital Markets in Socialism the profits go to the people. The TWTR Marxist and communistic socialist societies must suppress views other then their owns to succeed. You're wealth lost in TWTR will only be transferred to those leff fortunate. All capital markets are doomed in ones controlled by socialists. We know this thus why are you here? Why are you even invested in any of these bloated equity stock issues that can't survive in Socialism .

"Kamala Harris should be impeached after she takes office for helping violent rioters, looters, and arsonists in Minneapolis post bail so that could potentially commit additional acts of violent destruction. On June 1, 2020 Senator Harris tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota. We must use the same political weapons that is being used by the Left. Immediately, contact your House Representative to get the impeachment ball rolling.

"I just can't see how #TWTR survives going forward. It's not as fun as SNAP, IG or TikTok and its not as interactive and comprehensive as Facebook. It's not as useful as texting, WhatsApp, or ZOOM. And it just removed its #1 content creator. It's basically the AskJeeves of social networks which makes sense since it came out before the iPhone."
"Twitter and Facebook not only rob you of your fundamental right of freedom of speech, they also remove your right to privacy, since they SELL YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. And you probably wondered how you got hacked or how your personal data ended up on the Dark Web?"
Shame on the shortsightedness of any American holding or buying this stock at any price.
#twtr Twitter is a perfect stock to short right now.

"Subscribers going down is very bad news for an ad-driven revenue model. Their ""inventory"" of impressions generated by traffic will be down big, which means lower revenue per ad. This is just economics--as revenue per ad goes down, they need to sell more ads but they won't have the inventory--there's only so many ""eyeballs"" you can sell. Imagine Apple having to lower prices on iphones, but not having more iphones to sell--they could make more; how will Twitter generate more traffic? If tens of millions of subscribers have deactivated, how do you get more subscribers to join? This is a death spiral, folks."
NO FREEDOM LOVING HUMAN SHOULD HAVE STOCK IN THIS COMPANY OR FACEBOOK
"Shorting this from now on. It should be and must be an opportunity to express yourself. Freedom of speech? I think Twitter lost their core daily user by this move. We all know that what he/other did was wrong, but come on... Norway."
april 2017 this was a 14.00 dollar stack until trump started bringing millions to the site. and they still lost money. even last quarter. they are down almost 20 percent starting mid december before banning trump the decline started and has picked up speed.
"So all that money that was handed to BLM, where is it? Is it true that it found its way into the bank accounts of the three RACIST MARXIST hags who run that organization. We should be told. Seriously Jack, what happened to that $10 Million of SHARE-HOLDERS MONEY you gave them?"
"When at least 50% of the population value their First Amendment right of free speech, that does bode well for companies that actively try to censor it. I cannot imagine Twitter or Facebook will do well until this issue is resolved."
"So now the left is trying to cancel GME, and any other heavily shorted stock that might get squeezed. It's working about as well as Jack's censoring and chasing off half or more of good customers!"
All social media propaganda needs to go.
TWITTER = 330 million users. Subtract the 75 million that will leave....thats a 20% drop in users.
"Dorsey's company, Square was also down big today"
I can't trade till 7am with my broker. I hope the stock isn't zero by then.

"It's the perfect time for a competitor to disintermediate Twitter. Their base is stagnant and they clearly are biased. Like the monolith, we once knew called Silicon Valley, Twitters relevance is starting to fray."
Looks like Gab and Parler (post AWS ban recovery) will soon eat TWTR’s lunch!
Thank you Joe! We FINALLY have a president who will look out for the working class Americans. You non working Trumper’s will have to mooch off someone else.
Twitter is suspending accounts so they can't delete them and show the world how everybody feels..DELETE Your account
We are living in a socialist country where freedom of speech is banned. Sold my shares after hours
Americans lost thousands of jobs through Beijing Bidens EO. Thanks Joe!

"Left, Right, Middle, Neither, everyone really would be fine if twitter collapses. here's hoping it does!"
Retraced on weak volume; a drop on increase volume is coming before the close.
Time to start a CLASS ACTION. You longs should be sueing Dorsey and Twitter. He did not show due diligence and caused you to lose money.
Only a Millenial Zero Net Worth Starbucks Barista in San Francisco trading on Robinhood is telling his Zero Net Worth Co Worker what a great buy TWTR is because its down from its high. Dummies dont know this terd is going to $10.

Let's talk about the basic principle of Democracy The right to choose.In essence walk away from media tyrants...exercise your freedom from this thought tyrany.. express your self and do the right thing.
"Big legal trouble for TWTR. On their last 10Q under Risk factors the closest they come to censorship is what others do to them and not the other way around.....This is what I found....actions by governments or others to restrict access to Twitter or censor content on Twitter, such as how domestic Internet service providers in China have blocked access to Twitter and other countries, including Iran, Libya, Pakistan, Turkey and Syria, have intermittently restricted access to Twitter, whether these actions are taken for political reasons, in response to decisions we make regarding governmental requests or content generated by people on Twitter, or otherwise;"

Nothing beats watching you liberal twits loose your money on Twitter. Institutions are going to run real soon . It’s all about profit and how many subjects Twitter has
"January 25, 2021 05:35 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsTwitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) launched Birdwatch, a new initiative to flag misleading tweets.What Happened: Birdwatch is a pilot program that allows users to identify information in tweets they believe is misleading and write notes providing informative context, the company said in a blog post. The social media platform will eventually make these notes more visible on tweets for its global audience.While it remains in a testing phase, the notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site.""We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,"" Twitter said.Related Link: Tesla Seeks A 'Specialist' To Address 'Social Media Escalations' Aimed At CEO Elon MuskWhy It's Important: Twitter's initiative follows interviews with more than 100 individuals ""across the political spectrum,"" the company said. There was ""broad general support"" for Birdwatch that helps evaluate the trustworthiness of a tweet.""We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying,"" Twitter said.What's Next: Twitter will focus on how to prevent manipulative practices in its initiative and ensure it isn't dominated by a simple majority."
"YHO is in on the scam. Shameful to censor posts that don't violate their published TOS. By doing this, you are admitting your complicity."
"The drop in artificially inflated Big Tech companies like Twitter will be long and steep. If you have a profit in TWTR, better sell to protect it before in quickly vanishes. Just trying to be neighborly."
Twitter longs - you were warned repeatedly that this would gap down at some point. You have not seen the gap down yet - this is just the begginning. It will not be long before you will be wishing you could go back and sell at these levels. This literally may be a single digit stock real soon.
We want Big tech broke up!
Censorship - especially of government officials - will not fly here in the U.S.
I suspect that once the Institutional holders break ranks the decline will be massive. No way this company has any real value.
The borderline monopolistic stranglehold a few Big Tech companies have on the American political discourse is out of control.
"I quit Twitter 2 days ago after joining in 2013. I will eventually short both TWTR & Square stock. Not right away, but be patient, wait until you see the numbers lost during their earnings call, will be in the tens of millions. Bottom line is Twitter is really just a cesspool of people spewing their meaningless views. It’s trash "

I have been on Twitter ( not any more ) and parler and there is far more hate on twitter then I ever saw on parler..Those who believe Parler was a hate site have never used it and only believe what the media tells them which is sad and scary..Sad they believe the media and scary if the media says jump off the building they will
I deleted my twitter account. I hope this goes bankrupt
if you believe in FREEDOM OF SPEECH then do the moral thing and sell big media tech stocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Giving Twitter an upgrade and a buy signal is like giving the Roseanne cast an Emmy after they removed the star...
"Twitter's chart is as bearish as can be, SELL"
Hope Twitter and Facebook go out of business. I have use Twitter in 5 years and I have cancelled my Facebook account. They will never influence me again
"It's too early to conclude, but a severe economic downturn might be ahead. The job killing machinery now leading US economy. The so called Green Jobs will be actually be China Jobs (made in China). On top of it there will be open border policies. I am anxious."
EVERYONE Celebrating yet???
"I'm a Conservative. I Manage a Hedge-Fund, and I am shorting Twitter. lol"
Signal app instead of Twitter
I can't support it no longer
"Let teach them what ""power of freedom"" is!"
"74,000,000 Americans and many more are disgusted by Twitter's outrageous attempt to to censor the Conservative voice in America. Twitter will pay for it. The FCC will be on their back and watch Twitter shares plummet."
Is bad news still considered good news? Bahawahaha
"Twitter is the top most active stock because they’re being sold. It’s really because people had higher expectation for Twitter than FB Amazon we already know those are corrupt, we just did t know Twitter would follow."
Does anyone know which metrics twitter reports. I have uninstalled twitter on 3 of my android apps. hopefully they know that. I still access my account via the web and I haven't de-activated my account just yet because I do like to follow a little bit of sports news.is de-activating my account useful.. or is the lack of use enough.
"Politics aside, this company still isn’t profitable and it’s usership has already peaked. What a scam. They had over a $1B loss this year in net earnings in what has been a record year for social media useage due to the pandemic and it still has almost a $40B valuation. OUCH. (You all should buy this stock, maybe it will only lose $950M next year)."
Losing half your customers in a weekend and more following the exodus will destroy twit. Clearly investors were the last thing they cared about. On Twit the plan is a massive short attack. You won’t recover bc you’ve lost the base. It’s over. Watch for gab to go public. Free speech and own platform: TV Social media payment processing search engine...designing phones. All detached from goog amazon and apple. It’s over
Another good day for the 
"I have DEACTIVATED my twitter account several times few days back, but Twitter won't deactivate it. It shows still active."
I guess Walmart will be getting my Amazon business now. Later AMZN.
Yahoo just censored me for saying what Iran tweets... another tech silencing users.I BOUGHT FB around $20 and closing out ITS AS BAD AS TWTRSELL2021
Why do people invest in companies that don't manufacture a product and only sell their users information to advertisers for profit?
"$AMZN - Now that Amazon is being sued by Parler for removing them from their hosting site AWS for allegedly violating Amazon's standards, will they be inclined to remove $TWTR and $FB, two of their largest clients for the same reasons? People post violence and threats all day long on FB and TWTR."
"Can all the people who cancelled their $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts, cancel their Yahoo account too. Thanks!"
"This stock has ""Do Not Resusate "" written all over it..."
Twitter was a fad that is going away. So many better cos to invest in.....good bye twitter as millions cancel accts
the only thought more scary than using Twitter is owning their stock. they had one thing and they blew it. right or wrong this thing tanks!
"Not a huge drop like I expected, but wait until they release their quarterly numbers and have to reveal the. Umber of subscriber/users they last for the quarter. The day of reckoning is still coming. There’s still lots of room to go down before you can say the bad news is already built into the stock price."
"How sweet, from 55 to 45 in only weeks, Dump this stock on TUESDAY, let it fall and crumble, let it just go down into the abyss,"
I am shorting this for America...
I want to thank Jack for making all shorts rich......
"It's Wednesday, January 20, 2021. Who are Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts censoring today?"
TWTR is infiltrated by CCP.BAN TWITTER.
Head and shoulders
Parler is having network troubles now... It's being taken offline by communist Amazon..
"Soros is probably shorting TWTR, as far as he would be concerned, TWTR is just collateral damage, served its purpose."
Can we keep shorting TWTR next week?
"Get down, you over-priced over-hyped tool of the evil left."
Looks like it's losing the will to fight... we might see a big red candle before today is done.
"SoFi is a combination of $SQ Robinhood, and $LC Anthony Noto, Former Goldman Sachs partner and CFO of $TWTR is CEO of SoFi. Once the merger is complete, sofi will be in demand. I remember square trading at $9 after IPO. It took time and look where it is today. SoFi is on the ground floor. FinTech is a future.Load your Trucks and wait. SoFI stadiums in Los Angeles, home of Rams and Chargers, will Brand this company. Imagine, how many people will go to the stadium, in the years to come. What's 8n the Brand name  many  ."
Everyone that shorted this morning and won't know they lost until after work today 
Just realized Ive lost more twitter follwers than Sleepy Joe has supporters.
"Sell Twitter, Facebook and Amazon now. If you think it will do well in the long run, buy it back later when it goes even further down!!!!"
Just wait till Options Friday plummet...
I would like to see Dorsey lose eveything.
Parler found a server. I personally like GAB but will support any social media that supports free speech and dissent of any kind. MAGA
"Fund managers stepping in to help their Big Tech censorship brothers, like Jack Goebbels Dorsey, stop his stock from tanking."
"So it's wasn't the RUSSIANS RUSSIANS RUSSIANS after all, it was the CHINESE CHINESE CHINESE and China Joe and his pdo son were all for it."
"Twitter is a dead man walking now. The videos of Jack saying how he was going purge conservatives from the platform, put the final nails in the coffin."
I’m from Texas. All my friends will stop using Twitter. It actually isn’t a big deal. Most don’t use it much anyway.
Breaking News; Jack Dorksey admits he was wrong and resigns from his post as scout leader for failing to prevent forest fires.
Can you imagine Q1 earnings after millions delete Twitter and Facebook accounts? Poor decisions have consequences
"Boycotting of businesses that advertise on Twitter, FB and Google by 75 million Constitution loving Americans will drive Twotter out of business and FB to double digits."
short broken companies. Twitter has bad financials and I would deem them as broken for suspending the acting president of the USA.
"Let me think, I could buy shares in this company which has NO products, makes NO money, and what little they made they handed it away to BLM, or FOR ABOUT THE SAME MONEY, I could buy shares in a real company LISTED on the Dow 30 like Cisco, Walgreens, Coca Cola, Verizon etc..."
Twitter is run by the democratic communist party. No one is free to speak.
Let's take down Dorsey and Twitter.
Goodbye Twitter. Hello to only companies that support free speech.
"Many have erased their account, but Don Jr. is still active on twitter. Just saying."
Warren Buffett: 'Never bet against America'
Generally I feel bad when people lose money but if you support Fascist Media it's well deserved
Lawsuits are piling up. You’ll hear about them this week. Unless you listen to MSM. Then again you could also blame MSM from suppressing this information from you! More lawsuits hahaha
did you notice Yahoo fake news deletes every comment that has the name of president?
so the Iranian president who has repeatedly threatened the entire nation keeps his twitter but the US president doesnt ?
Twitter to 10 dollars by March. Shorted more!
Wow GAB has picked up Millions of New Users in the last few days!
"zuck face is out-of-control, stole the election and is now covering it... zuck has gone rogue... he will never recover... the american people will never forget his eggregious and unconscionable violations of free speech and the constitution and of the people, never. He's done, zuck book is done, turn out the lights, the party's over.$TWTR"
In honor of POTUS 45 Take this down to 45....
USA! USA! USA!
"Twitter is toast, you guys see Project Veritas? Dorsey gonna continue to drop accounts in the coming weeks/months etc..."
I smell the stench of panic here.....or is that Jack's beard.
Rally off the lows is merely a dead cat bounce. Last call for you longs.
Will be a sinking ship getting out now
Social Distance your Social Media stocks !!
This company never coming back.
Let it fall!!!!! I never in my life wished so bad that billionaires would lose billions. I don't bother them why they gotta bother me and take my Parler away?
"This is a classic pump and dump. Dorsey and his sort buy a few, in order to offload a lot. Buy this and you'll lose money. This dog is going down."
I reluctantly had to decline my invitation to the (T) Farewell tomorrow as I have exams early in the morning at Trump U and don't want to miss my internship at the (T) Foundation if I miss my exams.
Cancelled twitter accounts. CCP company watch for delisting????
"TWTR is past its prime. No matter what price targets the insiders put on it. With 0 earnings and 0 dividends, censorship of half its users, and upcoming govt regulations worldwide, eventually it is going down. Social media doesn't stay the same forever. A new popular platform shows up and it is done. Enjoy while it lasts. I expect it to eventually reach its 2016 lows. Yes, there will be rallies and sell offs on the way. It won't go down in a straight line."
I deactivated on the 6th and sold all social media shares when antifa initiated a riot on capitol hill. It was then that confirmed to me we are being manipulated.
Cathie woods bought Twitter now ark invest is gonna have to go down
"Censorship is not free speech, we live in America. Sold all my shares."
"Shorted 5000 shares Friday. This stock will be in the $20's soon. If a boycott of the current advertisers starts, as I believe it will, the stock will go to single digits."
even if you don't like mega you should still have the decency of not supporting a company that censors
New downgrades for Twatter. PT = $15.
make twtr great again!
Big sell-off tommorow coming. Nobody is going to want to hold this over a 3 day weekend
"Now that the Dennison Empire is experiencing a severe drop in revenue, I would encourage the Faithful, the ""Special"" people and the ""Loved"" people to send generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago. This one is legit, not to be confused with either the Foundation or the University.Income at Mar-a-Lago has dropped significantly. Thankfully the agreement that Mar-a-Lago would not be used as a residence will be ignored and Mar-a-Lago (the ""Club"", not the residence) will be able to continue to bill the US taxpayer for food, lodgings and golf cart rentals to the Secret Service.I would also urge you to send all your legal work to Mr. Giuliani to support him in these difficult times and to buy MAGA-branded My Pillows to support the downtrodden among us. That it all. Continue on Bigly.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Account Got Axed?"
Don’t fight the trend
TWITTER will be banned in India.
Not good for Twitter . . . Uganda has blocked social media indefinitely Slowing but surely several countries around the world are taking action against Social Media companies. There is power in numbers against FB and TWTR

Florida divesting from Big Tech. news.
Wow 50 Million shares DUMPED and theres still hours to go before the close!!
Friday $41-$42
"I wouldn't purchase a share of twtr for 20.00 a share, But that's just me. Free speech is a right according to the left wing as long as it isn't a Conservative making the speech. GLTA"
Twitter HQ right now
"Get Ready, Get Ready, Get Ready... for the Big Short!"
"Now the Dumbocrats are talking about giving families 300 dollars per month for each child. Where is all this money coming from? I did some math. If you stacked a trillion dollars if would go around the world approximately two and a half times. Oh let's pay off student debt. The educated people make the most money. You don't have to drive $50,000 cars. This is just the beginning. Their nuts."
"The left-wingers will try and buy the stock to prop it up as long as they can. When the 4Q 2020 earnings are released and the Analysts ask questions about how many registered users at end of January 2021 versus end of Dec 2020......look out below! The wealthy fascists may still be able to buy the stock on the way down, but eventually this t u r d is going to lose at least 50% of it's peak value."
Shorting more
Make a American great again sell Twitter !
Let’s see volume is already past average... Goodbye Jack
"Companies that don't want to have the rug pulled out from under them by political motivated scoundrels like Amazon Web Services should build and manage their own web servers so that Amazon, Microsoft and other left wing democrat CEOs can't destroy the company by cancelling web services. All companies should learn from what Amazon did to Parler and not rely on companies like Amazon for web services. Best to build your own and not rely on scoundrels for web services."
Oppenheimer must smoke something. TWTR lost 60-70 mil users .
"MEMPHIS (The Borowitz Report)—QAnon, which has hemorrhaged supporters since Inauguration Day, has announced that it is merging with the conspiracy theory that claims Elvis Presley is still alive. The announcement, made at a press conference in a parking lot across the street from Graceland, Presley’s longtime home, was seen as a bid to prevent QAnon from vanishing altogether.The overture to the Elvis conspiracy theorists came after QAnon proposed a similar merger with the National Rifle Association, which declined, citing difficulties of its own."
Buy more Twitter shares? Yes ! Only to SHORT!! The greatest Twitter account in HISTORY was banned today￼! And So go those 88 million followers. They are going to PARLER.
Sell TWTR. Revenues and earnings dropping. Eventually this drops a lot!
How about that 20% decline in the stock price?Gotta love it!!!The shareholders should be miffed. He has personally destroyed billions in stockholder equity.Should be voted out.
Let's short twitter
I think it is time for big techs to realize they don't control the country. time for this one to fall.
Say no to communism. word.
Everyone agrees with everyone on Twitter now
"Sale your stock, thousands dumping Twitter now."
"i sold all my TWTR this morning. sold fb last week. I keep very little aapl instead of huge amount, same to amzn."
"This is like business going off NY , Chicago, California to go to other state. SELL, SELL, SELL...."
"This stock was trading for $20 in March 2020, when it had twice as many users than it has now. Think about that..."
"Oppenheimer’s Jason Helfstein’s statement that he’s not concerned about the decision to silence Trump shows his ignorance—or possible deception (i.e., should he be attempting to exit under cover of an upgrade). Dorsey risked disenfranchising roughly half of the US market, when the future of Twitter—a company that has yet to prove it’s staying power—is in question. Does anyone really feel that TWTR is important or necessary? Trump might have seen it as important once—but who else other than a boatload of forgettable self-absorbed people trying to make themselves relevant?"
Sell off will continue today
"Biden while running for President, “I’m gonna stomp out the virus, crush it.” Crazy Joe today, “there’s no way we can stop this virus.” Good ol politics ; )"
Looks like conservative states are getting together on sensorship. Congressman from Florida said to ban big tech. I
Literally had just posted a comment about media controlling the message with Kamala Harris’ comments about allowing and encouraging riots to continue and how Twitter and Big Tech is doing the same to us. It was gaining traction and had 13-1 positive votes in less than 5 min and guess what? POOF!! It’s gone. Yahoo is part of the censorship problem. What a joke.
Thank gawd I never bought into the social media hype. Never established and account with any of them. Why in the he|| would you trust a heroin addict with your personal information anyway?
"3.7 mil sell off and 1.4 mil buy in. price is up, what a pile of ....."
lots of liberals losing big money today. Hope it keeps up! Feel sorry for the normies though
negative earnings and and 50% of accounts closed
Leave Twitter; join gab or Parler.Leave Facebook; join My Space- yes it is still around.Leave Amazon Prime; join a brand newer shopping service from Walmart.Fight Big Tech with your dollars and your personal involvement.
"Twitter and Facebook think they are essential, They are not, and they are about to find out in a big way. They are losing half the nation as customers, as Big Tech has shown itself to be monstrous socialists representing a fundamental evil no different than Joseph Stalin."
"What are you waiting for ?Boycott Twitter ,Cancel your Twitter accountShort Twitter !"
Half of twitters revenue and followers came from Trumps and conservatives. Ouch that's gonna hurt.
"Patriots need to get serious about extricating GOOG from their daily lives. Yes, they have been more discreet, but they're demons in disguise. Through Youtube and Search, their level of censorship is greater and more damaging than TWTR. And, don't forget the harmful impacts GOOG has on privacy. Having said that, let's short more TWTR."
Donald who?
how high we going on pump?
"Twitter is already losing more than 80M conservative and libertarian users in the US, maybe they can find new users in the big market of China... oh wait..."
Remember when the left wanted everyone to boycott Chick Fil-A?
"World exodus of big tech on the move!!! I Pray they loose so much money, they have come and live with the other 80% of the population!!!"
Wha it until Section 230 gets repealed and this thing will really tank.
"First of all, i don't buy shares of companies with negative earnings.second of all, I despise twitter, & uberkapo dorseymay the pain for twitter go on, and on, and on!"
"Twitter has chosen to slice away a huge chunk of their customer base.But unlike currently out of favor pandemic distressed companies, TWTR will never see favor again. They've chopped off an appendage that won't grow back.Maybe this is what they want. Maybe they want to be a small player. A small player with a 100% like-minded clientele in a zero controversy echo chamber.I don't know, but for a publicly traded company, that is arguably criminal.Not sure what tomorrow brings for TWTR, but the future is dismal."
"Don’t forget to hit mute on the liberals here. They won’t like it that’s for sure. Especially after about ten posts, they’ll get the hint."
Testing the 2nd Support point. Nice nice nice... Going under 44 in an hour.
"BUYERS BEWARE: You are not investing in a business that aims to be profitable for shareholders. You are investing in a political organization whose price depends solely on the actions of their far-left activist of a CEO. If you own shares, get out while you can. Dorsey is acting against shareholder interests."
Telegram Experiences Massive Growth in January: 90 Million New UsersTwitter is going down!!!! Sell now
I deleted my Twitter account - so should everyone else. Who actually uses twitter???? Who - except unemployed liberals - have time to read all those feeds. Twitter is proven now nothing more than an arm of the Democratic/liberal party.
I just deactivated my Twitter account...:somehow I feel “cleaner”. LMAO!
GET WOKE GO BROKE
where is brenda? I wonder if she still thinks $75 before earnings? LOL
"Will donate any money I made shorting this stock to any Trump fundraiser, especially for 2024 campaign, have been short since Monday...keep falling Twitter, thanks for the easy money! ha ha"
Look at all that RED!...Who said there is no justice.Put..short..put..
"Democrats are not good at business. They are good at corrupted business, but not free market fair and ethical business. The tech oligarchs should focus on BUSINESS and not politics. No good will come of social media and internet businesses focusing on politics instead of business. Let congress in the USA handle politics. Let the people decide how they are governed. Business leaders should stick to BUSINESS."
Shorts and people closing their accounts took control of Twitter's price.
"At the end of November, Jack bought 1,551,703 shares in an option. At the end of this year, they were valued at $84,024,717.45. Today they are valued at $75,180,010.35. Apparently, the price for social engineering the internet is around $10 mill. Good luck with your business model Jack!"
"Fellow patriots, please send your own message to Nestle, the biggest Twitter advertiser."
This is probably the best short in the entire market right now.
We the people have a choice and I choose freedom.
"These big tech company's are gonna learn a valuable lesson, Republican's and conservative's buy stuff too. Now these same company's can watch as Republican's and conservative's take their business elsewhere."
My Twitter account was locked yesterday for no apparent reason. Imagine if Walmart started blocking hundreds of thousands of customers. How is that in the best interest of shareholders?
Great day to short while the stock is up.
I would like a place where everyone is happy. Obviously Twitter CEO is against that.
"for those abandoning the likes of Twitter and anything Facebook, please do so for good and not just until they change their ways. IF they are to change and admit they had made a mistake, they will only do so because they have lost a ton of money. If you leave, I only hope you leave for good, do not give them a second chance, because if you do, they win."
Twitter sabotaging itself is saddening. Already struggling to engage teenagers thanks to tik tok & others. Will never recover
"Would be banned by more countries and the number of users is dropping rapidly, why risk your hard-earned money on TWTR?? SELL and GO ARKK, ARKQ, ARKG, ARKW!"
Just wait until they don't meet numbers and the subscriber base is cut in half. Remember --- it won't be just Americans leaving Twitter.
"Anybody that thinks "" If I just hold, it'll come back"" isn't paying attention. Twitter just DEEPLY offended half of its user base, BAD BUSINESS!"
sell sell sell!!!!
- Already unprofitable company - Just expelled its biggest asset - Just alienated half of the U.S.Might be a good time to sell.

I hope it craters. Free speech is critical to the continuation of our Republic. We need FREE SPEECH - we don't need TWEETERS
your freedom to speak is on the chopping block....make no mistake
I heard that the SEC has subpoened some documents from Jack. Using Amazon to shut down competition was NOT a smart move.
MySpace will look like a success story when compared to 2021 Twitter.
Big tech cencorship of consurvatives is very similar to Jim Crow laws written by Democrats of another era. Who will TWTR linch next?
Twitter and Facebook need to go
You should really try not using Twitter or FB for a week. The effects are truly surprising.
How far will twitter drop tomorrow? Gab picked up 600k users yesterday.
"DATA HARVESTING, that's what Twitter and Facebook is really about. They have been caught selling your personal information to third-parties, they even sell it to dodgy bad actors outside the USA. This is fundamentally why there are so many data breeches, people have your information, and will use it to defraud you."
bidens inauguration
Twitter and FB will never recover loving their flounder. Little Jack will soon be on the outs. Share holders lost big time!
Deactivated.
Twitter is recklessly putting their political agenda before their shareholders.
Guessing will drop below 30-40 pre market. Might just bottom out at 10. This is almost like getting traded for Tesla on S&P
So Apple is rethinking its decision to remove Parler!!Hmmmm!
"The EU has just announced they will be shutting down twitter, google, facebook and censoring apple, microsoft. YEEEE HAAAAA"
"AOC spewing more censorship and a commission to rein in MEDIA.Maybe she should rein in herself, get on a row boat, and paddle to Siberia."
"""CRASH TWITTER! This is a shot that will be heard around the world..."" PLEASE RETWEET THIS! lol"
Sell sell sell
Twitter fueling a civil war and driving users away from their platform. So reckless. Buy puts ASAP
"i love watching this stock DROP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i sold all my twitter, facebook, amazon, google and apple! time for the big media to take a fall!"
"It's no wonder that HP, and Tesla have moved to Texas in the past months. More are coming. The exodus from Commiefornia is a reality."
GET OUT NOW! You’ll thank me in a few months.
NASDAQ futures are down; after hours stock price for Twitter is down. Tomorrow could be a big down day for Twitter.
KeyBanc must be selling all of their shares today
VIVA TWITTER.... MY BLUE BIRD AIMS FLYING HIGHER....... REMEMBER THAT TWITTER PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE MORE THAN PROFIT......... TWITTER WILL BE REWARDED FOR MAKING AMERICA SAFE
"Banning individuals and denying free speech by $TWTR $GOOG $APPL $FB will not be tolerated. It is the surest sign that big tech needs to be broken up. Consolidation and concentration of any type of power (power, money, influence) inevitably lead to abuse of that power. Ironic that GOOGs first motto was ""do no evil."" They may all think they are too big to fail. I guess that depends on how you define ""fail."" In my opinion, they just did."
"Silencing speech is. not a Left vs Right issue. Its an American Right to free speech, and it shall not be infringed."
"Julian Assange is to be pardoned today, so goes the chatter..."
all my friends and family cancelled twitter. no need for it. also other platforms coming down the pipe.
"Hooray..after the steep decline in twtr stock price on monday,there will be a ton of lawsuits based on management malfeasance.The trial lawyers will be earing one of their own..LET the lawsuits begin hooray"
"Even a USPS truck driver announced he transferred 288,000 fraudulent ballots from New York State to Pennsylvania during the election."
I sold all my social media stocks. Free speech is a free speech. So if they don’t want us in their platform so my voice go with my money
"Even after Dorsey's attempt to calm, if TWTR closes below 46.50, the next support is around 42.50 then down to 39.50. This is looking Bearish at the moment and breaking through some technicals."
"Anyone who bought this in the premarket should check in with a shrink as soon as possible... Take your small loss, before it is a large loss. Get out."
"Voltaire said, “I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”I applauded as a shareholder from high 20s of the tool to be a great platform for a common man. But with it's recent actions, the firm trampled on one of the most basic tenets of democracy while enjoying the public protection through FCC policies. I am sorry to my part-time CEO. Due to that reason--as Mr. Wonderful on Shark Tank says, ""I am out!"". BOL.PS: With bi*** coin going the way it is, I might as well pull my funds from SQ too. I can't rely my businesses on firm that is risking my funds on unreliable bitcoin strategies. Sorry again Mr. Part-time CEO. I will be out there too."
"Hey Twitter, I love your new hair#$%$"
This is short lived.......TWTR is going down the tubes. It's being propped up until big guys can get their money out........then watch
"founder likely buying shares as well but every dog has his day and this commi company is going to negative ROI, on a one-way street to zero-villecommi puppeteer company imho...."

Losing today $$ Again Jack ?? LMAO Bankrupt Soon
$18 tomorrow.
In my opinion companies should be politically neutral and focus on business.
Remember people that Verizon owns Yahoo. Punish Verizon now.
"Saw it earlier on Parler by LW Exactly in quotations ""Apple is going to do an update on all phones to shut off the emergency broadcast system. This is #$%$ Germany 1938. Turn your auto update toggle off.""(US)Looks like they are trying to block EBS by T?Apple also shutting Parler down Sunday and users going to Gab..which has its own setvers."
Duck twitter. I deactivated myself from that communist ship hole. Next is amazon. canceling my sub after I receive the series I watch from ebay. I'll pay more but I won't support #$%$ Jeff.
"Twitter lost over 1.1B in the trailing 12 months. They made money in two of the last 4 quarters. They're at their peak and the stock price reflects future growth, not a good combination.At the very best (from their perspective), the FANG companies have now opened up a huge demand for competing products. That goes for Amazon and Facebook, and to a lesser extent Google and Apple. They all just created tens of millions (perhaps more) who will jump ship to any halfway decent competing products. Gab, Telegram, Rumble all surging. There is a huge opportunity for prepared investors here to fill the void."
Apple and google are taking TWTR app from their app storeTWTR going to $15
More than financial karma coming your way dorsey. Hear that? The bell tolls for thee.......
TIMBERRRR
sell stock
"The idea at Twitter, one would imagine, is to GAIN users, along with monetizing active ones. What we are seeing unfold before our eyes, is a massive user exit. It reminds me of my AOL stock owning days (I’m showing my age). So many people could not come to grips, including myself, of the massive amount of people that were leaving to find something better.Once stock holders figured it out......"
It's a Sure 100% Bet that TWTR will be in the 30's by Friday. It dropped $2.00 or 4% After Houres on Friday! Expect it to open in the $45.50 and Drop to $39.
"When Parler comes back online, many of us will be reminding everyone on there to not just ignore their twitter account. They need to DELETE their twitter accounts!!"
"Dorsey is probably buying umbrellas, hot pockets, shields, hammers and back packs for his Antifa comrades."
On Monday Twitter -20%
"Last chance to sell TWTR before it goes lower, you have been warned!"
Share price diving to 20
"“Anyone else feeling beyond let down?” one top post on a popular QAnon forum read. ""It's like being a kid and seeing the big gift under the tree thinking it is exactly what you want only to open it and realize it was a lump of coal.""Not a lump of coal. Underwear and t-shirts. Because santy clause is your mom and dad, and a lump of coal implies he's real and thought you were bad that year. But the TRUTH is underwear and t-shirts, and a prickly wool sweater for school.

I would be satisfied if each of the RED states would take a stand and prohibit these monopolies from doing business in those states.
My advice? Buy gold.
"When you have a platform that kicks off the conservative voices of your choice, how is this going to help stockholders and is Jack Dorsey simply ignoring the 2nd amendment? The answer is 100% yes and why I am shorting Twitter. If you are in this stock, Monday is not going to be fun!"
"SP has fallen nearly 15% since Jan 6th. Investors take note of the high forward P/E, high price/sale, high price/book and low book value. No dividends. What is it that appeals to those who are investing their hard earned money in this company? The stock price will continue to decrease."
"Cancelled my account yesterday and Facebook next. Now evaluating Amazon as well. These actions just propelled the big tech break up to a new level. They think they are invincible just like AT&T once was, Standard Oil, Western Union in the 1900's - the list goes on and on. I would love another phone company besides Apple and Google"
In a few weeks the survivors will be saying this.....
Twitter is continuing in a downward spiral as the charts show it breaking down on the charts with currently no bottom in site until you get to 39.43 which would represent the 200 day moving average. If it continues downward from there it would be ugly to say the least and would like fall to 29.43 area.

"HUD, I must admit two things right up front:- I’ve never posted on this TWTR before, and- I was duly impressed with your perspective!!If I may, I would like to add just one additional consideration:Someday (hopefully soon) America will realize that these platforms are just 21st Century Utilities and need to be regulated as such.Think not - Standard Oil, AT&T, the Baby Bells, Microsoft et al were viewed as abusive to the public interest. BUT EVEN MORE RELEVANT the Public Utilities cannot turn you off for your political views - why shouldn’t these fundamental consumer services not be subject to similar oversight? And, oh by the way, Al Gore invented the internet upon which they have built their businesses!!"
I just deactivated my account 40k followers. I’ll look into the gab app.
We need to go after the companies that run advertisements on Twitter. No support!!
"BTW, there is no such things called conspiracy theories. They are all possibilities, could be false or could be true. When something happens, which could be anything in this universe, whose cause is apparently unknown, to investigate or analyze why did it happen investigators come up with several possibilities e.g. theories. Then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause. That's the process. 100 years ago Albert Einstein's created many theories that were not proven at all until now. So if you use conspiracy theory then Albert Einstein's theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well - right? In his theory, legendary scientist Stephen Hawking said black holes could emit radiation, it's called Hawking Radiation. Not proven, no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true. So Hawking's theory is a conspiracy theory - right? Once again there is no such things called conspiracy theories - instead they are all possibilities, could be true could be false."

"keep in mind the richest person in the world holds this stock more than likely. Also ask yourself. Do we need facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram? No. We need to become humans again."
Twitter trying to launch. 
Some companies you just enjoy seeing fail. And this is one of them. Facebook will be another. No tech company is bigger than America itself.
"Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter pose a direct threat to our democracy. It's time to ""cancel"" them. Is short-term inconvenience worth freedom? You lived without these companies before. You can now. Let the free market replace them."

"I consider myself a moderate. Leaned left most of my life and now lean slightly right. This latest move by Twitter has even me wanting to leave the platform.

It is a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half. Maybe I am completely dead wrong. But I don't think so."

Social media's role in stealing the election for Kamala did not go unnoticed by governments around the world. None will trust Twitter and their ilk from now on. Litigation and regulation is in Jack's future all around the world.
"Take a Red Pill, Wake up and come to Texas."
TWTR was trading below $18/share when Trump won the Presidency in Nov 2016. Trump's usage of Twitter over his 4 years dramatically increased revenues and the stock price. Removing Trump will cost Twitter many followers and revenues. The stock price will parallel those reductions. Biden is just not that interesting and entertaining.

"Amazon ,Google, Facebook, and Twitter are the Southwestern Bell of the Twenty-First Century; Google controls 89% of the global internet searches. They determine what results you see in an investigation of information. Twitter and Facebook are the platforms that most US politicians use to communicate with their constituents or make a public policy statement.When these companies come together, censor and or determine which people or politicians will have a voice and which will not or taking down a competing platform that should be a concern for every American regardless of political leaning."
"Twitter, Facebook, Google Apple have been colluding for a while with each other and refer to each other multiple times as ""PEERS"". They are not peers they are competitors. Any action together as peers violate Anti Trust laws but more importantly have recently lead them to act on their own feelings instead of what is in the best interest of their shareholders. I really think those hurt by Jack Dorsey's incompetence should start a class action and sue Twitter."

They have to censor and control the Narrative they are the minority. a Reckoning is Coming
This stock will be $500 in a week..Perfect business model..Where else can you get a platform for free speech?? I know there is the minor flaw or you have to say what Twitter wants you to say..And if you don't they lock your account but hey they cornered in not so free speech
Closing my FB. Twitter Amazon and whatZapp not worth it to be affiliated to a follower of CCP My Amazon credit card as well will close close for good
Anyone owning shares of this terrorist anti free speech operation is an enemy of democratic principles and should be dealt with harshly.
Market Cap will be cut in half over next 6-12 months. Poor decisions have major consequences
"In my opinion, I’m not sure Jack Dorsey is mentally fit to run Twitter. Politics aside, I am buying puts and shorting."
Down 3 percent tomorrow
Parler could use half your servers since u dont have half the customers now.
Ban twitter for suppressing free speech
In the same week that Twitter banned the hashtag #1984. You can't make this stuff up...
Twitter has already has estimated lost over 2.6 billion in revenue from banning Trump due to the massive amount of followers he had made your bed now lay in itthats just from his account not counting the fall out from other that are leaving twitter. Facebook and Twitter have already lost together 51billion in market valuesee what happens when you are a platform supposedly designed for everyone and you think got to big for you pants and and control with your bias opinions
"If they can censor the president if the united states, what stops them from censoring you? It’s the principle"
"Good times are here again...On Thursday Joe will announce he's paying off 1 trillion dollars of student debt, give minority colleges 70 billion dollars , defund the police, ban fossil fuels, give everyone $2000.00 , and he'll do it all by taxing those evil rich people....You know who they are..They gave us twitter, facebook, apple, snapchat,amazon,tesla........"
"Twitter a company which cannot make money, trading at ten times it's value."
It was the pillow guy that was dragging us!!! Let's block more orange people please!!!!
"Any type of censorship is dangerous to Democracy. Censorship fosters a one-sided view with no dissent and that is dangerous as proven by history #$%$ Germany, Stalin Russia, Mao China). Twitter just became a tool of the elite to control the thoughts and opinions of the middle class. Twitter will pay the financial price since the people have the free will and resolve to make their voices heard by shutting Twitter down."
Will be another red day. Hopeless.
$20 stock prior to DJT using this platform to deliver his messages. Lets see what happens.
"Propaganda Minister ,Goebbells has joined Twitter Censorship commitee"
"EVERYONE cancelling Twittter..As it is an old, dying platform that is really not relevant anymore. Stock price will crash 2021 for sure. SO MANY BETTER investments out there why play with an outdated company"
apparently companies don't care about stock value. and more about politics. This should be grounds for delisting if they do not work as exclusively to be more profitable and grow. NOT minimize growth.
"Stock market will continue free fall as Byfen shutting down big industry such as petroleum, crazy socialist heading the budget and China taking control of US. DOW to 15K & record unemployment by end of 2022"

$50 coming
Send a real message cancel your account and sell your stock
If you read the Parler update on the website it’s very clear that the CEO of Parler is a far superior thinker and person than the Twitter CEO.
A lot of people will or have cancelled their Twitter account; just as a lot of people decided to not invest in $TWTR any longer - sell any stock and don't invest in an ETF or a Mutual Fund that contains it. Both will impact the share price. Lot's of other places to invest and make $.
One of the few times that it's ethical to short a company
Bankruptcy in the near future for this company
we are under naz! Germany control....
"jack Dorsey- ""We are focused on one account right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account, and its going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week, and the next few weeks, and its going to go beyond the inauguration.""

twtr will be under 10 by next 6 months
"You can't get the people back once they walk away. Twitter is being propped up for now, but the stock is collapsing."
Deleted my Twitter acct along with all my friends
This thing will go to 0.000
todays volume is 12 million above 90 day average. down 3% word is out. don't be surprised is if this is trading below $40.00 tomorrow morning
"I'm out! Cancelling my accounts at facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram!"
Limp wrist Dorsey and his embarrassing nose ring are about to get hammered worse than he’s ever known. This isn’t China Jacky boy! Censoring politicians in America is not a good look!
Look at that volume!!! Huge institutional dumping taking place...
"Hey SEC, any chance of looking at a company which in QE2, declared a loss of over $7 Million while handing away $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM? Also any chance of looking at a company whose CEO has actively discouraged half the users to leave his platform, doesn't sound like due diligence to me."
Max Pain at Options expiry on Friday
"It’s really sad to see people have no principles and buying this. For those buying, do you think conservative leaning people will return to the platform? And for those who are elated by the censorship, please go watch the hundreds of Holocaust survivor videos. Listen to the stories of the men who perished while storming the beaches of Normandy. So many people gave their lives so that you can say you don’t want these rights. Learn how countries become communist and socialist. Please go elsewhere and leave this country to those that appreciate its rights."

Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can. Make money on these Commies !!!"
"There should be a class action suit against CNN. John Sullivan left activist was with Jade Sacker of CNN inside the Capitol before the rioters and he is on tape encouraging them to riot. As they come through the front door she says on videotape we did it. No you, we did and gives him a hug. Who knew about the plot to spark the riot. That led to Twitter blaming the President and removing his account, which set off a fire storm of Big Tech and free speech leading to the incredible drop in this stock. This is a huge story about CNN involvement."
"Twitter will eventually be under 20. The attraction of Twitter is arguing with people you do not agree with. Once Twitter is nothing but a liberal love fest, it will not be fun and people will lose interest"
Maga RALLY in front of Dorsey's mansion ASAP
Deutsche Bank dropped him for all future business - his bankruptcy around the corner.
I sold all mine at twitter and close my account with twitter and I am asking all to do the same. This is for Our freedom and constitution.
"For those thinking this is only a US issue (~50+ million users/traffic about to bust), think again. Uganda elections getting same big tech interference. A purge is ahead."

"Jack Dorsey, AKA President Xi, has said it was a very tough decision to ban the sitting President from his platform. He also said, in the same breath, “Big Tech is way too powerful”. In fact he did show us all that they are in fact way too powerful"
we are heading down to 30.00 soon
Turns out Twitter been banning the wrong people. Child porn seems to be their business model. Must have been taking advice from Hunter.
Thank you Jack for making me tons of money shorting TWTR! The future of TWTR going down the toilet fast! Dump and Sell while you can! MAU going down down down each day!
I love it when a big company gets woke and then goes broke.
"Dorsey.....Destroying shareholders and the Constitution, for his vanity"
"We must be willing to fight fire with fire. Sometimes this will require sacrifice, but let us follow in the footsteps of our republic's founders who pledged their lives, fortunes, and honor."
I never understood why anyone would have a Twitter account?? Just children like Tommy boy who are juvenile.
A 15.00 minimum wage means business will lay off !I laid off 150 union democratic workers in Chicago and moved business to Florida!Huge savings !!!!I need trumps accounts ￼

NEW: Twitter has suspended GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for 12 hours.45’s Fanboys: “Who cares...we worship only one man and we were going to short Twitter anyway.” 
"I just cancelled my $TWTR, $FB accounts. They are communist."
"To those who currently own TWTR stock, this is a golden opportunity to lock-in your profits. Greediness in the market is always a bad strategy."
"TWTR is inciting more violence by shutting down Trumps account, so why aren't they being shutdown? Well, we know the answer..."
Wouldn’t be surprised to see Twitter open at 30
Looks like that tweeter bird got knocked out of the nest today
Laugh if you want but I have predict big shorting before. This turkey is going down.
well #twitter has now purged and baned #qanon and heavy followers of qanon. over 1/2 million users permanently band
"Next week when this is trading at $30 people be sayin shoulda sold at 45, hehehehe"
"twitter has no future, if anything it'll eventually fragment into a sort of Uber left version of itself and 40%+ of its userbase will find their way somewhere else."
America land of the caged by tech? Short short short
How can anyone trust Dorsey to do right by shareholders? Is he lying about user data? Selling and deleting my account.
I’m out. 40s next week. Can’t believe twitter longs think censorship and manipulation will end well
Closed my Twitter account today and shorted stock after hours on Friday. I still find it funny how some people still think we are twitter’s customers. We are their product. We are what is sold to advertisers.
"Unofficial reports suggest 20,000-50,000 users an hour are cancelling their user accounts."
Twitter account deactivated. Check.
Twitter is a liberal portfolio in a nut-shell...No wonder they are always seeking government assistance. Such poor life choices...
Do you think Twitter can survive as long as the rioting going on in Portland?

Give it time.
"CEO John Matze posted to the Parler platform on Sunday sparking rumors that the site will be brought back online imminently. The message, dated January 16, suggests the social network found a new cloud hosting platform, after Parler was booted from Amazon Web Services."
"The market is up today supposedly because weekly unemployment claims were not off-the-wall terrible , just terrible. These new claims are historically high when compared to pre-covid levels. Sounds like really ""good news"" to me. It is reasonable to expect retraction later today, when an objective understanding of this new data emerges. Twitter owners have been given a temporary gift to sell at a profit."
This thing is going down faster than Camel toe on Willie Brown.
Sell this stock. Save our freedom
"""Dorsey understands that FAIRNESS,EQUALITY and RESPECT are not just fundamental to the law. They are fundamental to productive workplaces and peaceful communities"". Really? Doesn't sound he understands the capitalized words very well."
Would you let someone who looks like this near your children?
I think being a stock analyst requires no knowledge. MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni upgraded TWTR a couple days ago. Who in the world would upgrade a company in the middle of their customers leaving in droves.
"WHAT IF - Conservative Americans started suddenly disappearing from the streets of America, but there was no open, unbiased and objective FREE PRESS to report where they had been taken and what was happening to them? Sound familiar??"
"There was a young man called Jack, who had a tattoo of Goebels on his back,while he was the boss, he ran twitter at a loss,and BLM carried money off in a sack..."
They underestimate the financial power of the American people.

Time to buy useful stocks like Tesla and Pharmaceutical.A Big dump is coming for Twitter and Facebook.
LOL I guess it’s poor business to alienate half of a country/client base eh?This action is going to be in business case studies for years!
TWTR will see $ 20 before seeing $ 50
Numbers do not lie. Twitter will lose a lot of revenue from users leaving.
"Parler CEO Hopeful Platform Can Be Back by End of January, God Bless"

"I don't know who would want to own this stock at these prices. Politics and free speech issues aside, they've made a bad business decision that they can't take back. It took them years to add those millions of users and lost them practically overnight."
I hope foreign governments now treat Twitter like China does. All credibility lost.
Definite Pump and Dump going on. MKM Partners? I'm a fund manager and that's the first I've ever heard of them. Short this. The Financial Media are manipulating the gullible same as always. Meanwhile world leaders in other countries are condemning Twitter and Facebook.
"As a conservative I cannot buy shares in a company who hand money to organisations like BLM and Antifa. That's where your profits went. No one asked you, but you funded BLM and Antifa burning down the cities."

Take your money and run. Sell.

Bad news coming on Twitter. Heard it here first

Unless they try to prop this up to sell more calls today the Chart is showing a major haircut
If 15.00 is minimum take a good guess what the unions will do next ? Yes strike so a union laborer will want more than the 44.00 they make now !Bull S___

Haha sold! And sold Apple too. Bye bye CCP stocks.

Deleted twitter that took a few seconds...deleting facebook is taking a while have to get all those pictures off!
Looks like one Snowflake her has 10-12 Yahoo ID's and is giving thumbs down to all of the bearish posts. Won't work Snowflake. Is that you Ronjon The Sissy? This thing goes to $10 or so eventually.

At what price will the Board of Directors and investors ask Jack to step down as CEO/Chairman?
You can post video about Tiananmen Square on Twitter. You can even post the photos showing those that didn’t make it. Not sure what the problem is.
Mute the liberals here. They won’t like it. Voice deleted.
Citizens across the globe - cancel Twitter accounts - FREE SPEECH IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR! Investors will feel the financial PAIN!
"Ronjon , Antonio and J soon to be in the poorhouse"
Market watch raised the target so wallstreet can get out. The volume is way up. The price is holding. They want to sell their shares to someone that doesn't know any better.
"Did you all see Nancy's video discussing Democratic playbook regarding making false news, then the media will support it? Is that not treason?"
To close your Twitter account go to settings and privacy. Then hit account select deactivate. Then key in your password. Now you can remove your app from your device's.
"Hey Dorsey, about that $10 Million of share-holders money you gave to Black Lives Matter? So what did they do with it? Who has it now?"
WILL DROP to 45 today. Going to happen. Opening RED again.
Twitter should move to China where they would be at home censoring speech
January 14th: “Dorsey: 'This Is Going to be Much Bigger Than Just One Account”. Run awayyyyy!
Feb 9th. Mark the date. This will be a mixed earnings report. Why? Because it was near the end of this quarter that Twtr decided to become Totalitarian. People will be confused. They may buy more or sell off. It won’t be until May that you will see the picture start to make sense. At that point investors will be selling.
People should not buy from Amazon and apple. Stay away Twitter and Facebook! Don’t use google search!
Twitter should be a $30 stock before the end of the this month. They just lost half of their users LOL
they will try to prop this up keep selling
"Let's be real...Tweety Bird, FB and the like will always be popular apps and stocks. Please sell so as can buy the Dip!!"
You dont have to have a Twitter account to be an injured party.
"Well this is fantastic, cuckoo Dorsey can now censor the news along with individuals. Unbelievable people actually support this."
Biden is going to give the republicans a huge win in 2022.............
conservative minded SEC attorneys are thoroughly scouring $TWTR financial statements to see if there were any disclosures made warning investors that Twitter is a left leaning political organization..despite what they say they are in business with Democrats..politically biased to the point of purposely alienating 1/2 their customer base..if these risk were not disclosed..they will be open to shareholder class action lawsuits
Dorsey did say it will better in the long run. Maybe 100 years from now you will see the highs.
Sell Twitter stock now! The ship is sinking!!!!!!
"Yahoo says TWTR has negative earnings of $1.58 per share and reads ""overvalued."" Go figure."
"Short this stock to hades. It was trading for $22 in March 2020, and frankly that was double what it was worth. I personally don't think it's worth 10c."
3 million new accounts in last 12 days. Guess which service? Hint: it ain’t Twitter.
WOW look at all the twitter shares!
"Let's go America, keep selling!"
"TWTR income is -1,239,000,000 get out now Twitter is going to be on the OTC markets. You will be better off investing in GAXY at this point."
$3 Billion written off so far. Dead cat bounce won't last the morning lull. lol
Sell before this crashes! Not a joke
Going too gap down after earnings 
Google and Apple trying to remove access to Parler to stifle the competition. Better get it now before the censors take it away. Time to move away from Apple and Twitter too. Also time to exist that the politicians remove Google's protected monopoly.
Wait until opening bell. The drop is going to be beautiful!!
Congrats shorts
Schumer just said House will deliver impeachment article to Senate on Monday. Bye Felicia!
"My business boarded up a lot of windows in downtown Chicago when the riots started .Who wants to live like that ? And pay employees over 45.00 per hour , and pay high taxes ?You liberal that voted for joe just watch the jobs numbers the next 4 years"
"Hundreds of rep investors will dump Twitter stock at the opening, this is a coordinated action. I advice everyone to setup stop loss orders."
obama started the war on cops and pelosi started the war on the law enforcement officers who enforce the immigration laws...
"Do the following facts indicate a buying or selling/shorting opportunity for Twitter: negative earnings, no dividend, small number of shares shorted, controversial CEO, lawsuit filed against the company for child sexual abuse on Jan, 20, recent loss of up to 100 million platform users, and the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab. Seems clear to me that the stock price of Twitter is more likely to go down than up."
"Twatter, I'm seeing more porno and ""as seen on TV"" products in their ads now. SELL ASAP before it's too late. They're keeping it up artificially and one day the big boys in NY will jut take 'er down and you'll be stuck holding the bag and it doesn't even pay a dividend."
Monday may be the largest bear raid in history. I bet Tim Sykes' army is lined up to bring blood. Will be fun to watch.
"Has anyone else noticed whats going on in Portland....People are beginning to run over "" peaceful protestors "" with their cars..."
"Twitter reached user saturation nearly 10 years ago. It's simply not a very useful platform for anyone beyond socialites, celebrities, and politicians. Did you ever notice how most of the tweets that the average person hears about are typically embedded in more mainstream news sources? Smoke and mirrors have been the only thing that's been keeping the numbers looking good. IMO it's useless technology that's been struggling for a reason to exist for years."
"why didn't joe have 28,000 Social workers protect him today ? and suddendly likes walls ?? Weird"

The market lull is right around the corner. Watch it fall.
Sell everything. Take your money and run away. Sell everything. This stock will go bankrupt.
Delete your Twitter account!
BIG insider video released by project veritas. Dorsey doubled down on continued bans saying right now it’s only one account but soon they are expanding to many many more and inhibiting freedom of speech however they see fit. This is done
$3.2 BILLION of TWTR's market cap has already been erased. The worst is yet to come. It couldn't happen to a more deserving company.
What flavor was the kool-aid today?
"down 14% this week, and it will double that loss next week.will be in the 20's a week from now."
Twitter did it to themselves.
"In one week the big guy eliminated 11,000 pipeline jobs, rejoined the Paris accord costing Americans billions, caused gasoline to spike 50cents a gallon and promised to raise corporate and income taxes......It's going to be a long painful expensive 4 years..."
"Twitter MUST Disclose material USER loses via 8K or face Investor lawsuitsRule 405 under the Securities Act defined the term “material” as follows: “when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of information as to any subject, [materiality] limits the information required to those matters to which an average prudent investor ought reasonably to be informed before purchasing a security."
"Take your money (whats left) and buy real hard assets. Banks, Oil. Protect yourself from tech asset bubble."
Twitter should release the names and Tweets of everyone banned.
"Twatter still at it. Suppressed the news how elected officials forced 26,000 national guards to rest inside a packed parking garage with 1 restroom during a pandemic! #$%$ is Twitter allowed to do business in the USA?!!!"
Elon Musk Used TWTR This Morning! Nobody Is Leaving TWTR! The Bird Is The Word Baby!
Censoring everyone they don't like
Did any Republican congressman say impeach the MF when Joe got elected. OH...only a liberal can get by with that. Why can they do and say anything without repercussions? Watch this post will be deleted in a flash.
I just received my TWTR stock...

It is amazing how many people trust Twitter with their hard earned money
Trading app Robinhood accused of AUTOMATICALLY SELLING users’ shares after banning GameStop stock
This is absolutely beautiful! Patriotism wins every time! Hedge funds dumping TWTR and FB due to legal instability!
"This stock has to trade on the financial fundamentals and not on political opinion. Right now, there are a lot of amateurs trading this stock on their political opinion and they are going to feel the effects of gravity soon."
back to $9
"Too bad, @Jack cannot censor Yahoo! Finance TWTR MB... He is getting eaten alive, here! And he deserves every bit of it, too. I suppose he'll be lucky if he doesn't spend considerable time in the slammer, but that's just my opinion. How can a man get away with breaking the First Amendment of the Constitution like Moses slammed down the Ten Commandments? At least Moses was responding to his people falling into idolatry. @Jack is trying to run the world by censorship and manipulation of the public narrative. ILLEGAL..."
Imagine owning stock in a social media company that lost billions of dollars in value because they censor people they don't agree with.
Interesting business strategy to tell half your user base they’re not allowed to say what they think on your “free speech” platform.Let’s see how this pays off for investors.
Wow so it’s true. I made a sensible comment that yahoo didn’t like and it deleted it.
"This is about to get really ugly for Twitter investors, get out right at the opening, set sell order at market price and save what you can"
selling Facebook tomorrow. I will not support suppression of free speech there either.
The fact that big players are pumping this soon we’ll regret it
Best short stock of 2021
No one really needs twitter or facebook.....you may have a happier life by actually getting back to life without social media.
The US has 3 or 4 times as many COVID19 cases as China or India and they both have over 3 billion people while the US only has a little over 300 million. It’s a shame the previous administration didn’t take COVID19 more seriously. Remember “only 15 cases soon to be zero” or “it’s fully contained and will disappear like magic.”The US now has 25 MILLION COVID19 cases.
This is what you get when you censor more than half of America.Believe it or not...... We are the silent majority!
Didn't Jack Dorsey fund $10M to the BLM Riots? YES
Yahoo just took down my post about the BLM Activist who has been arrested for invading the Capitol and egging on others to do damage. It was a set-up people.
Down $10 since the high of last Friday. That's about 22% of the value lost. Easily $10 Billion written off this week...
Looks like it's more than just 80 million people leaving the platform. Other countries are already banning it and more are planning on banning the app in the future. This is a global wipeout of the company.
"As it continues to slide, I plan on buying if it hits $10/share."

"Ever ask yourself why 75 million people STILL believe this election was stolen? Maybe it’s just me but people don’t like having their candidates chosen for them. Everyone saw what they saw and no matter how much propaganda you cannot erase this criminality out of the heads of that many people. It was in your face and overt. Big Tech fully complicit in this criminal behavior and Jack, et al should be prosecuted under the RICO statutes. Sell ."
TWTR losing millions costumer daily .The business is like sinking ship.
"I sure enjoy watching this conitinue to drop, we would like to see it drop faster, millions of us. One thing is for sure, the actions to censor the American Patriots IS going to lead to competition. As soon as #45GOAT announces his suppprt for a platform, thats when this #$%$ crashes."
Insider selling at SQ. Wonder if they are trying to prop up Twitter's stock price?

This company made themselves a tgt. That does not align with what I want as a share holder!
"How do people not see the way the media covered the inauguration? The media talked about the people their like they were royalty! While over 40,000 armed guards and 12’ high fences kept the average American out. If you can’t see it god bless you. This is a horrible terrible time in U.S. history that’s about to go down."
Twitter - OTC Soon
John Kerry owns a private jet and refused to allow wind energy to be set up on the coast by his vacation home! And Cuckoo Dorsey is being endorsed by banks! Welcome to America!
Interesting how Parler went to #1 before cut. Twitter replaceable? Investable?
"Surprised it hasn't fallen further. There's a huge exodus away from the both Twitter and Facebook occurring at the moment, judging by the numbers deluging alt tech sites. Parler will probably restart and do as Gab did, building it's own infrastructure. Even if it doesn't, Twitter has ensured that its growth will dimish."
"75,000,000 accounts about to close..."
Account deleted
"Sold all my shares. The tech company is supposed to back freedom of speech, not blocking it."
"Wow, only a $9.86 book value. This stock is way overpriced imo."
"With all sincerity the average investors much prefer Apple stock for a long hold. TWTR exhibits extreme volatility which attracts day traders like me who have no real interest in the company, except in this case Dorsey has personally offended me."

"Angela Merkel just denounced TWTR. Everyone should listen. Germany knows a thing or two, ‘cause they’ve done a thing or two..."
Over the last 4 years we've seen people beaten in airports and on streets and ejected from restaurants just because they were wearing a hat someone didn't like. Attending a political rally was to walk through a throng of shrieking belligerents. To ask unpopular questions (or express an opinion) about how votes are counted and processed and how a count can run negative is to be called a liar and deranged. Where is Twitter and Facebook during all of this? Busy helping America decay.
TWTR becomes a stale echo chamber in long run. Not the best time to own social media.
"Buy the dip peeps...January 13, 2021 07:16 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsMKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni upgrades Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) from Neutral to Buy and raises the price target from $47 to $60."
You can bet Dorsey and his mates are offloading their shares right now. Which he got for free incidentally.
"Facebook does not own Myspace, rather it is privately owned by two brothers.Conservatives should cancel Facebook, and join Myspace."
Stop buying shares Jack you're going to need that Money for the Antitrust suits. COLLUSION
I wonder how user growth is going? HAHABoot Jack!

Just another Liberal analyst Holding this up so his company can bail out...
"Of course TWWR is up, since the majority of big shareholders all have connections to China."
"twitter just permanently deleted 1 very powerful account, then 12 million twitters followed suit by deleting 12 millions twitter accountsouch ! fair trade to me...."
Jack Dorsey was working remotely on a private island in French Polynesia frequented by celebrities who are avoiding the paparazzi when the decision was made to ban Trumps account. Disconnect from his company may be an understatement.
"Jack Dorsey issued a statement. It reads ""REEEEEEEE""."
Buh bye TWTR.
myspace 2.0get out while you can.
And this moment nothing can save TWTR.
Don't be tricked into buying at this price by Jack. You will lose money when the market opens. Opening red.

"Just cancelled my TWITTER, NO MORE OF THIS CO. IE STOCK IN MY PORTFOLIO!"
"I deleted Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook."

This will be the mother of all short plays come Monday morning.
"Lets see if u lose half of your 187 million users, do u lose have your revenue from advertisers soon, did twitter cut its expense in half today-no , so why is the stock not $25."

Wait till Parler comes back up
"I wonder if shareholders can sue the corporate officers for becoming involved in politics in a way that DESTROYS the company? Can investors sue? If so, twitter will be locked up in the courts for the next 10 years. I have deleted 2 twitter accounts and my facebook."
"Since reaching its 52 week high on December 18th, the stock is now down 18.4%. Wonder why????????????????????????????????"
It might be the beginning of the end for Twitter!
"Ronald Reagan, in one of his more famous speech (and one of his most accurate I might add) stated, AMD I quote. ""If facism ever comes to America it will come in the name of Liberalism"". Now we have them. Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Cook and Bezos, plus folks like AOC, Schiff, Pelosi and Schumer. Boycott their companies and the businesses that advertise on them."
Twitter expected to crash - see low about $12 per share soon. Users exiting in droves.
"Probably go to single digits.Dorsey is odd. Like most tech savants,This company is in no position to act recklessly.Shareholder class action suits forthcoming."
We need to compile a list of companies advertising on Twitter and boycott them. The use of our dollars is one of the strongest weapon we have in the struggle against the Left. Please post info about Twitter's advertisers if you have it. Thank you.
better get out tomorrow........
It all makes sense now.. Remember how confident Barack Hussein was when sending the message to Putin about how he'll have more flexibility after he wins the election.. The fix was in then and he knew it..
surprised people are willing to hold this over the weekend. I would expect monday next week to be another gap down day to start another down week.
Look like people will move to Reddit..this stock will be down when ER coming.. Good luck..My predict around $35.00 or lower..Short will win.
"SELL,,,, SHORT,,, SHORT,,, SHORT,, it's all about free speech...... let's show them free speech..."
"Zuckerberg, dorsey and bezos walk into a bar and the bartender says: "" get the$%^* out of my bar........I bet you thought there was a joke there....NOPE"
"Wow my last post is not here. It must have been censored, only thing I can think of is I mentioned the T man in it. This is getting pretty crazy."
Considering what Dorsey is doing to people who do not have the same political ideology as he... Twitter should crash...which is what he deserves. Too bad others have to suffer for his evil doing.
"Get rid of this stock. Don’t use Twitter, apple, Amazon and especially FB"
"TWTR likes that 900,000 people lost their jobs, it has always been behind people not having good but very bad."
almost 8% down... HA HA..
"Never used Twatter or Facistbook and never will. It's a brainwashing/mindcontrol tool run on people's dopamine receptors. Probably the worst thing for education, IQ, attention spans, and society in general."
"The same pattern holds, flaccid pump attempt in premarket, then back to red. Didn’t manage even 1% green today."
Was really hoping the stock would drop a lot more than 6% today well there's always tomorrow
"""Our job is to prepare for global revolution and reset."" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to his employees"
This #$%$ is heading below $40 this week
"Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO: “We are focused on one account [@realDonaldTrump] right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account, and it’s going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week, and the next few weeks, and go on beyond the inauguration.”Twitter is a sinking ship."
Amazing this stock is still this high. FB and TWTR clearly want to have their own power over our civil rights. Treat them as a publisher.
"Unity, Hun? Nancy Pelosi has a new term to describe congressional republicans."
I pray that everyone buying puts and shorts this mf makes enough money to donate some to their fellow republican lawmaker. My parler is @DropShock reply with your parler and I will follow back. Ps don't forget to deactivate your twitter account

Thanks to the Pedo in Chief we can make a fortune shorting the Market the next 4 years. Twitter is just the beginning

"Mark my words, Twitter will be trading on the Pink Sheets for 30 cents in 6 months."
A fad alienating 50% of its consumers. Strong sell.
most wanted in America by conservatives and Free Speech backers
So does Dorsey know that he lost half his assets? Users are his assets. But he is still stuck with high debt and only half of his assets operating. Timber!
Better have your orders in to dump this stock first thing Monday. This thing is going to tank by atleast 30%. I have seen so many people deactivate their accounts. Bye bye AD dollars.
"This thing is taking on water and will lose 70% of its value, IMHO. Jack Dorsey does **NOT** care. He has made his billions. I'm out. Too much pain."
"With only a relatively small amount of their shares being shorted, 2.7%, many hedge firms might short Twitter in the very near future. Couple this possibility with mutual funds unloading some of their shares, Twitter's stock price could be in deep trouble."
"Make your next laptop purchase a PC, not an Apple. We must fight the attackers of free speech with our dollars, as hey are the strongest weapons we have available to us."
"I've watched shorts kill stocks many times. It takes a concerted campaign but it's going to happen here. Never underestimate the power of the shorts. I even remember me and my friend laughing our heads off as we shorted a stock into oblivion. Short this, make money from Jack's misery. That's karma people."
I hope parler goes public once it comes back on line
I'm outa here before it gets worse.

I just cancelled my amazon prime and I can't be the only one. I have not had a bank account since the financial scam of 2008 as I use a credit union. I will go door to door to tell people to not go to twitter. I will campaign on the internet. I will get people off twitter. I may even pay them a small sum to close accounts
forget politics just remember they had 1% MAU growth last Q. 1% growth.
"In the past four years, both David Dennison's and John Barron's short game has improved dramatically. Bigly."
By June it might drop to $10/share.
Someone just dumped 400k+ shares.
"Go to the duckduckgo search engine and start to type ""how to delete"". The first 4 autocomplete suggestions are how to delete your Facebook account, Twitter account, Instagram account, and Gmail account LOL."
Bets guess this week will see another 12% drop.
Twitter is only for the left! This means they make money from half of the population!

You will never be free as long as we use Dominion voting machines.
I gave Twitter the worst rating in an Apple store. I also wrote a scathing critique of them. Do the same. I wish this company would go bankrupt. That anyone who invests in it will lose all their money.
"I hope Parler sues Amazon for $100B. This is not fair, only happens in fqXi China!!"
Millions of Twitter accounts closed. This stock will drop like a rock.

I understand why you twitter investors keep your shares.. after all Judas accepted 30 pieces of silver
"Closed my personal and business twitter accounts and sold short 5,000 shares. America 1st!!!"

"This may be a drop in the ocean, but 3 people in the household deactivated and delete Twitter over the weekend."
I think the ISP’s should block Twitter and Facebook for going against their policies.
Sharesholders of Twitter should have the Jackalope removed
"Good morning! It's Tuesday, January 26, 2021. Any predictions on who Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts will be censoring today?!"

Illusion if you think this is going to stay up. Democrats and Republicans and conservatives will be running from Twitter. This is just the beginning.
I wonder if the CCP Flag will be flown during the successful Coup operation ceremony.
Why would any American invest in a company that is against the 1st Amendment ? One could say this company is anti American and should be shut down .....
I'm selling my TWTR.... I don't believe in what they now stand for. Not right that they took away our President's right to free speech. Freedom of Speech...
Does anyone really see Twitter as a stock to own long term? Seems like a goner to me.
"Twitter and Facebook exist solely to sell your personal information to third parties. They don't care who they sell your information to, they even sell it to bad actors outside the USA who will use it to steal your id's and defraud you. This is fact. They've been caught doing it. Zuckerberg lied to Congress and claimed he didn't know he was doing this... Well Justice is coming to them. Facebook and Twitter are on their last days."
You novices are about ready to get hit with the stock market of Chairman Xiden.
reverse split coming in Twitter.
"Jack Dorsey's OTHER company, SQ, up 6.5% TODAY! LMAO Do you little rightwingers feel a little bit spat upon?"

Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can."
Why does the Ayatollah still have an active account?
TWTR is today's Tokyo Rose. An incredible source for forms of propaganda. Opinion without truth or verification. Amazing they are allowed to operate as they do.
"F twitter, banning free speech. Sell now"

Everyone be sure to thank a Veteran . They fought for our right to freedom of speech. We as civilians failed them. I for one am ashamed and deeply sorry. They bled on foreign soil for it and we paid big tech to take it away. To any vet reading this thank you so much. I vow to do better
"If much else happens regarding an uprising from the right, here’s how it goes to a complete uprising. Big tech in conjunction with our government will put a clamp down that would make the last few days a walk in the park. That ain’t gonna work."

"Everything liberals touch turns to Dog #$%$ just like San Francisco, New York and Twatter"
This will be the third day in a row that the DOW is down. Is this the beginning of a bear market. Artificially inflated companies like Twitter are going to take a beating.
This was upgraded. CNBC said to buy. Why is it going down?
"if twitter directors are selling their shares now, how long before they have to declare the insider trades?"
"Communism/socialism/fascism are all bad. My parents who used to live in Romania experienced it. Look at what happened to Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989. It starts with censorship and this is exactly what Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google cartel are doing now. This is troubling. I deleted my TWTR, FB (including WhatsApp, Instagram) accounts and cancelled my Amazon Prime membership. I always used Samsung phones so AAPL never got my business. I'm looking for an alternative to get rid of Google's Android. They will not have my business and I sold all my 300k investment in their shares. Good luck to all. Peace!"
I wonder who’s pumping the price for an exit?
"Twitter, the Titanic of social media just hit the iceberg. Don't worry folks, it just cant sink, but on the Twitter Titanic ship, there are no life boats."
You investors in Twitter stock need to see the writing on the wall. Stock may be artificially held up but not for long. People ( Democrats and Republicans) that believe in free speech are leaving. There is no hope. Stock will be 20 by the end of February.
The markets long over due for a major correction.......
"No Parler. No problem let’s use twtr, google Ann and apple conversation board on yahoo finance.. lmao yahoo is another biased outlet"
"No more revenue sell and buy NIO now before you lose more money,"
"Sue Jack, Save Freedom.""In recent days I’ve been made aware of dozens of conversations by former Twitter users that thousands of people might not only be eligible to sue #BigTweet but expect a bit of a payday in doing so.Beginning the day following the January 6th activities in Washington, DC, Jack Dorsey got aggressive, hostile, and intentional in the mishandling of his enterprise.The argument that Twitter—as a private company—can do what they wish with impunity is holding less water as the scope of the malfeasance is coming to light.By estimates from my own observation and discussion with others, Dorsey intentionally maligned the welfare of his company. In most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecond.His actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld. Given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of Twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectations.And last week Jack Dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath. He did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation. His actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to $7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product: an audience.So there are plenty of reasons shareholders, the public, and former Twitter users should consider legal recourse."""
over TWTR 40M accounts were closed for thew last couple of days. and this is only a beginning.
We should learn from our past. The country cannot thrive or survive so divided. Very sad and both sides should be worried for the country.
ummm what is that clicking sound.. oh it's millions of people deleting their twitter accounts!!!! bye bye
As Nasdaq rallies Twtr sells off. Strong sell
MMs holding it up to let certain holders out ! After this process takes place kaboom it will drop like a rock
I sold my shares and thank you Jack for been a hero make me losing $$$
I wonder if jacks house is still standing.
"just think, next week when this is sitting at $32, you'll thank yourself for selling at $46..."
"SELL Twitter,Amazon facebook and anything that will destroy our country.. If you love your country & value your freedoms do the right thing We cannot allow the media to become a dictatorship and block are speech!"
"we all can contact the FCC by phone , e mail to voice your anger to big tech blocking free speech ,"
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out censorship. Makes sense.
This is only short more on up tick
"Had Twitter stocks for the last 12 months but I’ll be selling my 10.000 shares today at the opening. I don’t want to own a company that is biased and is limiting the freedom of speech, that’s just over the limits for me."
In short as of right now
"Today, I deleted my Twitter account, which I've had for 10 years. Cancelled Amazon Prime. Cancelled Youtube TV. Next I'm ditching AT&T for a better ISP service."
twitter was never a good business! Why would you invest in this anyway!
"Anyone still long in Twitter, consider this morning a gift. Sell now!"
"LOL...the Dems want to cancel the middle class! And if they do, who do they think is going to pay the taxes?? Real bright people over there."
"Even thought Rudy isn't gonna get paid, he's still going to sue Deutsche Bank for not lending his client any more money and the PGA for cancelling their tournaments at his client's golf courses. Bigly. Believe me.MAGA - McDonalds and Golf Again!"

"Keep on shorting,,, as long as people are censored stock will keep on falling..."
"Good morning, Friends. It's Friday, January 29, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
Are we citizens or subjects?
"As an ex-investor of TWTR (sold at $54.45 in December, thank you very much), it's clear they're no longer interested in profits or shareholders. While Dorsey's bagged his mega-millions, his business model is now social engineering. Investor beware."
Institutions running for the exits!
Would it not surprise you if Dorsey was in Portland with Black umbrella in one hand and a molotov cocktail in the other
"looks like twitter is going to be broken up, so sad, hope you got out lol"
Too much Risk here. Reward favoring the Short side
you think Dorsey cares about the share holders?
"Had an issue with my Ameritrade margin account, so I had to temporarily cover TWTR last week. No worries! I'm back on the short wagon!"
The Leftys here think they can control the Narrative on a stock board never mind the numbers and the chart. this ain't uncle Jack's Twatter
"A while back I saw an article trying to estimate the value of Trump to TWTR. This was 4 years ago when the stock was $15. They had Trump at $2 Billion. Add 4 years of growth because of Trump being President, and all the other conservative personalities (who were also deleted, it was NOT only Trump), and all their followers, and replies, retweets, and retweeted retweets, so on and so on. Then look at the profitability of the company, or rather the lack of it. This will very likely swing them to a loss, and if angry conservatives start boycotting advertisers, this could be extremely damaging. This isnt some spineless advertiser caving because of one or 2 angry liberals, this is half the country. While there may be damage tomorrow, the real damage will come over the next few quarters. Neither Trump, nor his 88.7 million followers are ever coming back. Ever. This is a permanent, self inflicted injury by someone with a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders. This will very likely be the largest shareholder lawsuit action history."
If you really don't like jack. Don't use square other company owned by Jack!
"If I were an employee, with my stock options being torched every day, I'd think about quitting and starting a real apolitical media company."

going into the 30's by Wednesday.
Problem is Twitter....I haven't heard a single left-wing person or group complain about being censored on your app.
How many Twitter users are left??? Left being the ket word. This is not a company but an arm of the DUMBmocratic party. They want cancel half the o#$%$
This stock is a Sitting Duck!...over $50 share price with Zero earnings...and 83 million ticked off people canceling accounts in droves. Not to mention the Tsunami of Short Sellers at the open! OMG look out tomorrow 
"If this stock survives at all, it's because AAPL and AMZN propped it up with massive amounts of share purchasing."
SELL ALL before TWTR down to $20!!
"I was a long term investor in Twitter. For me, this company is dead. Sold what I had with profit. (Before hate, I’m not American but freedom of speech is way more important than politics or money)."
"Tuck Fwitter ,, Join ,,,,,,,,,Weme telegram"
Jack Dorsey intentionally and willfully torpedoed his own company. But it’s not his to do that with anymore. It belongs to millions of people owning those 751 million shares.In discussing with legal experts all of us who have been impacted negatively would be wise to form the largest class action suit in history.
Look like they are layoff 25% workforce next quarter coming ..good luck long..

My price target is 13$. This stock is OVERVALUEED. Especially as other countries put down laws to stop twitter.
This stock would be much lower if we knew how many million people deleted that bird in a box icon in the last week
"Assume TWTR is going to blow a NUT of cash buying stock in order to prop this up short term. Keep on shorting. Its inevitable this communist censorship platform will have no place in America regardless of political persuasion. I have not shorted it yet, but plan on doing so at 49-50"

"Twitter down the sheter.. active users are in a decline, they were losing market share before the authoritarian power grab.. move to G AB and D issenter.."
Somehow 45 is even playing more golf now than he did in office. I would have thunk that was impossible.
Chart looking good today.
Exit before this plummets
How many people are going to quit Twitter now? Who even cares about Twitter? It could disappear and the world would be better off.
At what percentage of a loss will institutions start dumping ?Right now we are at 20% .Keep up the good work vanguard is starting to worry
"JUST one simple question to ASK: Why risk your hard-earned money on this fast-loosing-user TWTR stock? There are so many good stocks / ETFs to make money, SELL TWTR! SELL TWTR! BUY ARKK/ARKW/ARKQ/ARKG!!"
"Sold. Win or lose, principles are important. This stock deserves to tank."
Time to start boycotting all advertisers on FB and Twitter and stop using Apple products plus cancel your Amazon prime and quit using Amazon. Write/email/text/call (or all of them) the advertisers and tell them you are never buying their products again as long as they advertise on FB and Twitter. Some group needs to start a website with a list of advertisers.
Cancel Twitter and follow the same people on Parler. It’s back.
I hope the stock tanks!
Twitter bans maga we delete Twitter
"After hours Large Block trades.16:57:36 50,561 shares at $45.1817:26:56 5,106 shares at $45.2717:57:19 2,100 shares at $45.2517:50:58 2,000 shares at $45.2617:39:16 5,954 shares at $45.2518:42:22 224,362 shares at $45.18 THIS IS IS A WHALE LEAVING.The after hours volume was 1,030,533 either BOOKED or TRADED, There is a big difference between the two.The large blocks booked in after hours of a 1000 or more is 290,000 shares, I saw lots of 1000 trades and even more 999 to 100 shares booked or traded.Here is the kicker about half of the after hour volume was for 6 to 1 shares booked.As I said in an earlier post when you see 1 to 10 shares being traded in real time or booked in after hours, these are Funds/Institutions or Market Makers and maybe a combination of the three to keep a Stock Price from TANKING.In the case of TWTR 76% OF THE COMPANY is OWNED BY INSTITUTIONS, with VANGUARD being its LARGEST OWNER of Shares.These FUNDS are about to lose there Clients monies big time on TWTR and the fund managers who did not keep their eye on the ball here will be held accountable, if they do so and get away with it they would tar and feather Jack Dorsey at the moment.How FUND managers see Jack Dorsey at the moment is of LITTLE CONCERN to JACK DORSEY, Because 44 year old JACK see's himself a CRUSADER, Against pretty much everything those Fund Managers Stand for.If anything Jack fancies himself a modern day CHE' GUEVARA, with a nose ring."
"Wow, as millions cancel their accounts, just how low will this dog with flees really go?"
"twitter chased off a lot of conservatives to another place, then blocked that place only after they had closed their twitter account. how do you like them apples!"
how is this not impeachable?
"It looks like TWTR will be down for longer time, this process has just started. Great short candidate."
"I wish I could short this stock. I don't have a margin account. However, I am glad I don't owe any shares in this sinking ship.... Only a commy with no morals would own shares in this company"
"Let’s face it, if you are willing to steal a US Presidential Election, then you will do anything. Today’s actions by the EAC will shock you."
anybody going to short this today?
Twitter upgraded to $65 target pricing by Keybanc today

Expect right-wing governments around the world to heavily regulate or ban Twitter for good.
Who in their right mind would want ot be holding this until Tuesday. More to come from Project Veritas over the weekend...

Once a shareholder . Never again . No freedom of speech ? This is not China . They Took away Trumps account.
dorsey doo doo
where is the bottom?
Looks like last days of twitter. #downwithdorsey
It is clear that China and other countries interfered in the 2020 election.
Who expects Twitter to lose 50% of their stock value today?
"sad day. look up the definition of communist. USA is no longer the home of the free, and no longer home of liberty."
"Ideas have consequences, @Jack."
COMMUNIST - EVERYONE DROP TWITTER - FACEBOOK AND CANCEL AMAZON PRIME MEBERSHIPSDUMP ATT AND VERIZONGET A PURE TALK CELLULAR PHONEIF YOU WANT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN THIS USA DO-IT NOW
"Dorsey you work for the shareholders, not the democratic party."
"With millions of cancellations, just how low can this get??????????????"
Millions of people all around the world are deactivating and deleting twitter.
Agree. Institutions are trying to unload slowly to the end of the month. Will see in 20s next month!
MY PREDICTION: Twitter will be trading for 30c on the OTC market in 6 months. TherealDonaldTrump made this fleabitten company popular.
"I?ve never shorted a stock before but seriously thinking of shorting this #$%$ Monday, guaranteed winner. This stock deserves the beating it?s about to get.Let?s change the term ?social media? to what it really is ?socialist media?"
"Twitter, FB, appleSold all shares and will NEVER buy again. Twitter actions prove that they are not fair and report only news they feel is appropriate. No freedom of speech with these companies. I urge everyone to stay away from these socialist companies"
"I haven't had a twitter, facebook or linkedin account for years. Only use yahoo for stock charts and occasional stock conversation. May leave that too. Stopped going in cnbc and all other fake news also years ago."
Bye bye Jack
Amazon now has joined the censorship sweeping America by cutting off their servers to Parler effective at midnight. Conspiracy theories need no further introduction as Big Tech hasshown they the true conspirators trying to destroy America.
"Obviously retailers will be selling on Monday. Question is will institutions do so as well? If they do and large hedge players short it, then it could be dooms day for Twitter."
twitter bird 2021.
Too woke - gone broke
"Jack will dump a large amount of shares this week. Watch and see. At that point Twitter will fall, and the fall all the way to the pink sheets..."
It is so funny reading comments about people justifying buying this stock
"Most people here want to make money trading...I get it. If we don't stand up for democracy and our freedoms, trading in the free market could also be wiped out if we are not careful. Be careful what you wish for by keep big tech in control."
How long can they hide the # of deactivations? Not forever.
Longs I see a big Red Candle coming.
yahoo has a estimated loss of 25% investing at these levels 
Head and shoulders formation complete and ready for the massive dump of this #$%$ company on the 1 year chart
this company needs to tank big time....let's go
"I've watched Shorts take down oil companies. This fly on the wall company, is an easy take down. Shorts have it..."
Any American company that is against free speech should drummed out of America and your stock should be worth no more than 2 cents a share. Next up is Amazon and Google. I have reduced all my business dealings with them as of today and will have all associates follow. Remember 75 million customers don't agree with the Socialist Communist agenda the Democrats are putting into effect.
I canceled Netflix yesterday
I have never liked this company and its CEO. Never had an account. I am Just saying Twitter is an unnecessary thing.
Mayday mayday! Twitter will crash soon! Sell! This is not a joke!
"It's Thursday, January 21, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
"Still shorting :) if anything it my patriotic duty to do so. No matter how you slice or dice it they will loose users, slow growth and if boycotted they will loose a lot of advertising revenue. For a company that is not profitable now you think the action they take are worthy of your money or the stock evaluation. Just wait it doesn’t happen in one day but this will go down. Mm and hedge funds will see that it’s a risk for growth and revenue they will start to transition as well."
"Q1 earning on Feb 09, 2021.....I think the number of users will drop significantly."
I can't believe this is happening in America. I dumped Twitter and Facebook this morning.
I guess we’re supposed to be taking suggestions from Dorsey now with Bitcoin. Lol
15 more minutes and the US is a vassal state of the CCP. The TWTR oligarchs shall rule you with the iron thumb of censorship.
"Uh-oh, DOW Futures are down tonight; that would be 4 consecutive down days for the DOW, possibly indicating the start of the long anticipated Bear Market. If I was a Twitter bag-holder, I would be a little nervous about the near term prospects of Twitter's SP. Just saying."
I hope Twitter falls back to $20/ share before February 2021.
Now I sell lol 
TWTR is in good hands of shorts .
Can you believe Spotify banned potus? Why? To make a statement. I’ll listen to Sirius

Over valued. With a MASS exedus of users.....no profits. Dead company by the end of the year.
half of these posters do not even own the stock and close to the other half are from russia.
Nothing says I won an election like having to vet the National Guard and hire your own private security team like they do in dictatorships
Is it possible this thing will go back down to 20 or lower?
Is there a vaccine to protect the public from the dreaded Twitter virus?
"Once again, no worries, as Twitter is up slightly on very weak volume (less than 50% of its 10 day average}.The next big volume day is fast approaching, and when it comes it will send TWTR into a severe downward spiral."
"TWTR is the next MySpace. In case the self righteous Wokers running TWTR doesn't know what that it is. Too bad for you. You're about to learn. Words of advice. Text your parents and ask them to get the basement ready for your return. After all. It's not that hard to put up a website on internet. Just as the internet is new and exciting, in years to come it will also be littered with sad tales of self destruction. TWTR makes nothing. It traffics only in text. Their self importance and societies police is the beginning of the end for them. Facebook too."
god bless maga
Longs enjoy your Marxist Echo Chamber as this goes to OTC
"Time to dump Twitter stock. Half the nation is no longer allowed to post there. They just purged 4,000 of my conservative followers, with more to come. James Woods lost 173,000. Twitter is just a refrigerator magnet for the Democrat Party."
I sold all shares of TWTR because its speech control makes me feel that I'm living under a Communist country.
"NEGATIVE SUBSCRIBER Growth, TANKING Revenues, Terrible ER, Terrible Guidance, but $TWTR BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!"

When does Jack jump ship? Indictments coming soon
I hear twitters getting sued by a kids family. This is great news! I love it!
Twitter should be shut down for 5 months for considering permanent suspension.
All in the same week that Twitter banned the hashtag #1984. There's irony for ya!
"I'm kind of enjoying this drop little by little every day . . . like drip, drip, drip!"
No blank adapters on Capitol grounds NG indicates how twisted new administration really is.
I think twitter is a good buy at $5.00
"Major stock collapse today, ser your stop loss orders guys, seriously, there’s a coordinated effort to tank the stock today at the opening."
200 day incoming
"TWTR stock without profits, no dividend yield and the earning per share -1.58.I don't believe that the retail investors spend over 40 bucks/shr to invest to this Junk. Financial institution hold this Junk now they want to get out, so they trade back & forth to PUMP & DUMP this Junk. Watch out for the trap..."
China Joe's first full day in office and Dow finishes down.
FB just hit the 6-month low mark!
"Hunter texts Joe, about being caught with his 14-year old niece. Joe replies don't worry we are too powerful. That is what is wrong with the USA..."
"We deleted FB, Twitter months ago!"
"It's Tuesday, January 12. Who are Jack Dorsey and his Twatteratti censoring today? Oh, look, QAnon is the newest recipient of the brownshirt treatment."
why would u even buy this ?
Wish there were 5 days next week for this garbage to fall instead of 4....actual stock holders should have bailed already....think of all the money they will lose in the coming weeks...its unfortunate ur ceo lacks the foresight to see the consequences of his actions...wallet gonna hurt!!!
It’s amazing to watch them pick in chose what riots are ok. Huh....who woulda thought Columbus was going to get in trouble over this? ;)
I just don't understand why it's down 10%... and not 50%.
Can you give the finger to half your customers and still succeed?TWTR stockholders want to know.
All the big holders are in meetings now getting approval to sell. This is is going to create such a crazy chain reaction sell off.
selling my shares on Monday. Already cancelled my twitter account buh bye
"Twitter, Amazon, and google shut down any users is like Utility companies shut down your water, gas and electrics. Think about it."

"C'mon Yahoo, how can you delete messages in a split second but let people who violate your terms of service 40 times a day and not suppress their abusive remarks or ban them for at least a month or so?"
"This is just the beginning. Wait for the revenue misses. The subscriber losses. The lawsuits. The downgrades. Heck, you better worry that people will march on their headquarters. That is how angry Twitter made people."
I got in at 47 even though I have never touched twitter. No one person/event can stop tech monopolies. FB proved it last year and twitter this year.
"how low can we push twtr,, show them what freedom of speech is all about......... short short short......"
It’s being held up to let institutions out . High volume today big boys need out
These investors want to prop this company up. They will lose millions and millions to prove it.
No future for a one sided chat group LOL
Volume shows a slight sell off and this will continue for a few weeks ! I see this going back to 30 or lower
Twitter stock is down because they ensured that every country outside the US is going to severely regulate or Bna themImagine the UK allowing an ideological San Francisco company to control the BBC. Will India be ok with Twitter having authority to de-platform Modi?
I'm selling my 1000 shares on Monday morning. TWTR crossed the line and attacked our constitutional rights yesterday. Peace out.
"For those that don’t know about the Industrial revolution. As history looks back at it, essentially it is a group of powerful rich people that destroy everyone and everything in their path in order to achieve ultimate wealth. The result was global division that is still present today.Dorsey has made a historically horrible decision."
Kamala Harris wouldn’t even be able to keep this UP today!
Boycott any company advertising on Twitter! Make sure to leave a note saying why.
"Lets remember back....Twitter was in the RED prior to the president getting an account. NOW they have eliminated him and many of his followers.....HMMM....where is Twitter headed....to the sewer.Florida now seeking to divest the state of Twitter, FB, Apple, Google and Amazon...Good luck to those companies."
IMHO tweeter/Facebook will be shut down next week
"We’re in process of selling all shares, an deleting app. BYE-BYE...."
Sell sell sell. Get out now folks. Writing on the wall. Twitter is done!
When a CEO manipulates the stock price should not the SEC step in and halt trading?
Is there anyone left in TWTR? Today they took down Wall Street Bets
Biden’s executive orders just destroyed over 4 million jobs. Which of you will be victims?

The collapse will soon intensify. Twitter will be $15 in a year.
Market: Twitter snaps 6 day losing streak Angry Americans: hold my beer.
Jack thinks he is the King. he controls your freedom of speech. Submit to him or he will BAN you. SELL!!!
"Deleted all social media accounts, and boycotting all PGA advertisers."
and here I thought the twitter communists would at least get one day in the green.
HAVE FUN BAG HOLDERS KEEPING THIS STOCK OVER THE 3 DAY WEEKEND!!
"The next base of support for TWTR is at $24, the price that Elliot Management and Silver Lake bought it for last March. The question is whether or not Elliot Management and Silver Lake want to sell their stake or if they want to make organization changes in upper management. The political animus within TWTR's rank and file employees in hurting their ability to reverse their losses on the balance sheet."
Sell! This is expected to tank within a week! This is not a joke!
Twitter offends half of the USA and their stock price goes up. This making money off stocks is a very confusing proposition.
PM hard fall. They will release the 8K soon
"Yahoo Finance refuses to trend TWTR forum. i checked the top trending stock, and they don't nearly post as much... you would think Yahoo! would take this opportunity to step up and show how different they are from google"
"Jack: ""we gonna purge millions of accounts from twitter.""Investors: ""we gonna purge billions of cash from you."""
"Maybe my friend is right about trading this. He just texted me to say he's made money already this morning, but that he'll be out of this before the market opens. lol Ah well, I wouldn't risk losing 10c on this garbage. But if he can do it, then fine. Just don't get caught holding this when the market closes..."
"I canceled twtr, closed amazon and migrating from gmail now. It took me a few hours to cancel all of my amazon subscribe and save items. Last night I made my first online purchase I would have normally made using prime. I landed on Ace hardware for what I needed. It will be a little work to establish alternatives, but after a few months I should have new accounts setup to make shopping online as easy as it was with prime."
"Twitter is old. Looks old, feels old. It's old."
Huge loses coming tomorrow or Monday...Jack was just caught on hidden camera talking about his political agenda. project veritas will be releasing the video tomorrow I believe.
Sell on this dead cat pre market bounce.
"A former top official at Facebook openly declared Sunday that television service providers should stop airing conservative content, citing TV networks like One America News and Newsmax.Facebook and Twitter are out of control."
I urge everyone to take a look at TWTR's chart. Set the range to 1 year daily. What do you think? It looks like a small pen1s is forming. LOL!!!
Twitter looks and feels old. It is so 20 years ago.
So let's get this straight Dominion. We vote and you then process our votes in Italy?
I understand banning extreme right-wing nut jobs. But an entire political party??? That is the exact definition of fascism...
"This weekend showed that Big Tech has way too much power and are overstepping their authority. If you want a free country and not operate like Communist China, we have to leverage the only power we have which is to complete stop utilizing the following company's service. 1) FaceBook 2) Twitter 3) Google 4) Amazon and 5) Apple"
Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for dinner. Liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote.
TWTR will be buried forever and rest in peace. Parler coming back .
"Down Down.....REJOICE patriots...every decline of $,01 in the price of this stock,,,,,proves that we have had enough of these elite Media Tyrants who think they know what's best for us,"
sell sell and sell
wonder if jack d sold anything before he made his announcement last week?????
"Even if there's a chance of a dead cat bounce, why would anyone waste their money on a company that doesn't make money already and now just infuriated half the country???"
#DEACTIVATETWITTER
"As much as I’d like for it to drop like a rock, I prefer a slow bleed. Then we move on to the next company. Rinse and repeat."
Wonder how much shareholders cash Dorsey will give to BLM/Antifa in 2021? Is it any suprise that Twitter can't make a bean?
"I too CANCELLED my Twitter account. As a Patriot and Veteran I swore to uphold the Constitution of The United States, of which FREE SPEECH is a critical component. TWTR will soon feel just how large the Silent Majority is! Oh, and I also have my first-ever order in to SHORT a stock!"
another high volume selloff day. This isn't the end of the downdraft.
"Mark my words, 30c on the otc markets in 6-months. The shorts are taking you down Jackie boy."
shareholders are going to have a rock-solid case when the class action lawsuit hits Twitter. I'm pretty sure there was no disclosure that they were getting ready to become a political lobbying organization on behalf of the Democratic Party. not to mention the idea that they are working with the other Faang stocks to become a communist anti-free speech platform
"How many Antifa users has it blocked ? Hopefully, people will stick with their convictions and not buy this until that CEO is canned..."
"""Hit the road, Jack. And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more...."""
I hear a lot of Twitter employees are not too happy with Jack
Just 7% off. . Too easy to get off for our infringed freedom of speech. .. wait until 930 am. It will be deep red.
"David, Chuck...will u guys buy my shares when I cover my short on Monday? I know u will. #brokelibs"

"Remove money from all anti American institutions, brokerages, banks, colleges, and any others that suppose they can use your money do whatever they please to us. Well that’s the past. The new rules the left wants to play by, are about to be used in kind."
"TWTR-SEC violation= When will TWTR make the timely disclosure of a MATERIAL DROP IN subscribers?Note Trial lawyers! Will you sue a ""Democrat"" company???/hmmmmmm"
meanwhile back at Twitter HQ jack is storming up new ideas
Permanent ban on oil and gas development on federal waters and land could cost 1 million American jobs.
Breaking News... Parler will be back soon.!!!! ..Twitts are finished..
My prediction. 6-months and this will be on the Pink Sheets trading for 30c.
I will not use Twitter ever again
"Of the first 13 arrested in Capitol Hill unrest, zero had Parler accounts. The vast majority of planning or discussion of heading to Capitol Hill took place on Facebook and YouTube. Google owns YouTube so they can’t possibly block their own site. Big Tech must be sanctioned, financially penalized and broken up in a way that this never happens again. Imagine if these tech companies were based in China and had banned our President. Wouldn’t we ALL be standing unitedly against it?https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9131977/amp/Parler-squeezed-Trump-seeks-new-online-megaphone.html"
Timber
Who in their right mind is buying this thing? They just lost half their users and now there are videos and employees coming forward with all their dirty deeds. Last chance to get out.
can't invest in a company that doesn't give its users the freedom of speech
"Dorsey: “So, the focus is certainly on this account [@realDonaldTrump] and how it ties to real world violence. But also, we need to think much longer term around how these dynamics play out over time. I don’t believe this is going away anytime soon.”Dorsey: “You know, the U.S. is extremely divided. Our platform is showing that every single day.”"
Bye
"Today the DOW was down for the fifth consecutive day, losing a whopping 634 points.it's now official-the Bear has replaced the Bull. On the count of three, let's all say together-Bear Market. 1, 2, 3 BEAR MARKET"
It's reached the point that calling things 'conspiracy theories' are just convenient dismissals the left-use to dismiss uncomfortable truths. The truth is more shocking now than any conspiracy theory out there...
BLM are very angry to hear Dorsey won't be able to hand them another $10 Million Dollars in 2021...
"Consider banning all business with large investors of Twitter: Vanguard Group, Inc. (The) 81,120,247 Sep 29, 2020 10.20% 3,609,850,991"
Sell this 
Hey have an idea.... let's ban Twitter!!
"Let me just put it this way: Jeff Bezos did Jack Dorsey a favor last night by shutting down Parler. But, what they don't get, is that we're not coming back. Having nothing is better than being a patron customer of a tyrant media platform that deems whatever it wants unacceptable and kicks it out of the public forum. And, hey Jack, you can check my Twitter account. I really did deactivate it! And, Parler or not, I'm not coming back."
3 dollar stock come this summer.
Options Friday! Loads of Fun Here at TWTR;) Love Our Beautiful Blue Bird!
"Any day now Tucker Carlson will find the duplicate of the evidence that he ""lost in the mail"" the same night that his dog ate his homework and Rudy Giuliani will release the evidence gleaned from his most recent Lev Parnas-sponsored Ukraine Walkabout 2.0.After coming off dozens and dozens of successful lawsuits, Rudy Giuliani is about to drop the bigly hammer on Dominion with his explosive, blockbuster evidence (which he's given to Tucker Carlson for safekeeping).In the meantime, I would urge the faithful to mail their generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago to help with its day-to-day expenses which have become ever more so untenable due to the refusal of Deutsche Bank t extend additional loan and the PGA having cancelled future tournaments.The NRA will no longer be able to make shadow donations due to their recent bankruptcy filing, but the billions that Rudy Giuliani will glean from the successful countersuit against Dominion will ensure that Mar-a-Lago is overflowing with orange Nike Soft golf balls and berders for many years to come.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Making Attorneys Get Attorneys"
Down again by 1%. If it drops to $10/share I will buy some.
A whistleblower inside Twitter recorded CEO Jack Dorsey and sent Project Veritas the recording.
down fast
"Hello! It's Monday, January 25, 2021. One wonders who Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts are censoring today!"
This is going to be the best short. This stock will go to zero as soon as someone comes out with another app
"Here’s a joke for ya, what happens when the CEO of a social media app and a guy running for President team up. The CEO loses Billions in market cap and the guy running for President signs 30 executive orders in his first 6 days that costs Americans 1,000,000 jobs. Pretty funny huh ; )"
Time for all people Dems and Repubs to cancel twitter. Clearly Twitter will silence any of us.Good bye Twitter... the end
State of Florida is considering Divesting ALL Big Tech Stocks!! AWESOME !!
Well congratulations to Cuckoo Dorsey and Crazy Joe they successfully wrecked the market in 8 days of teamwork.

Tweeter & Face-plant looking a little shaky today.
Will the bird lose its ability to even fly

"In a letter Piton sent to the Arizona legislature in December, he pointed out that more that 50% of a sample of 1,000 voters in the 2020 election were not real people. The sample came from a list of 100,000 voters in the 2020 election in Arizona."

Thinking of moving to Florida because all the Cubans know what’s going to happen next...

All true Americans should delete their Twitter account tonight. We should not support censorship of anyone.
Dorsey must have taken a fresh hit off of the meth pipe before making the decision to censoring free speech
"I just heard the EU is looking at RICO type charges against the CEO's of twitter, facebook, google, apple."
Is it good time to start a position ?
Sold my 100 shares of square today based on principle. There are better places to put your money. Didn’t own Twitter or I would of sold that too! Down with Dorsey.
How’s the censorship working out for the investors? $TWTR $FB
"Deactivated my TWTR account. Not a real political person, but can't support a company that is. Also hard to imagine a social media company the size of Twitter in the COVID era that still can't make money. What happens when people are back to socializing in real life??"
"Conservatives need to focus on destroying one company at a time. Then move on to the next. Take one down and give the rest the message to treat everyone fairly. If they don't we take down the next company. We cannot take on Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter all at once but we can cripple one at a time."
"Tweeter stock holders, get out asap before you lost all"
Get woke go broke. Seeing it happen in real time - priceless!
Twitter is the modern day Marxist communication platform
The tech giants would rather see tens of thousands of innocent people die than allow this information out to the public. We have never seen anything like this.On Saturday we heard word that Tom Fitton is still suspended off of Twitter — 14 days later. Tom is a leading voice for truth in this nation.
Anyone really miss being on twitter......I have not.
TWTR also out on google and apple app store
Why would anyone hold this? Agree or disagree with recent actions this thing is not going up. lol
looks like puts pricing in 38 to 40 by march.i think it will happen by Februaryi wonder how they are going to lie earning day.
I'm out and closed my account...good luck!
What I like most about this SHORT most is there isn’t a single FREE THINKER Bag holder here! 
How do you ban The Don and not expect any repercussions...
"America, now has 3 New Forms of Government: Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook !!!"
TWTR bag holders furiously looking for appliance boxes to hold off another cold night.

you can hear Jack saying that they are about to take their ban project MUCH bigger and MUCH wider.

It didnt get punished enough today IMO.
"Alternatives to hyper-inflated stocks like Twitter: stocks that are actually profitable, have reasonable P/E ratios and are paying dividends.Real estate, which is booming due to low interest rates.Precious metals like gold and silver.Corporate and municipal bondsCommodity futures- there are many different ones to choose.Being long in hyper-inflated securities is very risky business and is NOT the only game in town.Hedge funds will be driving down the price of stocks like Twitter via massive shorting, much like they did to unprofitable companies like Gamestop, Express, AMC Entertainment, Bed, Bath and Beyond. A short squeeze opportunity in stocks like Twitter will only occur after a massive amount of shorting has occurred, which is in the distance future. Twitter's current short position is a very modest 2.7%.Good all to all."
Shareholders sue Twitter for losing all of their money on purpose.
"One thing I learned from this episode : the greatest threat to America and its freedoms is not China, Iran or North Korea but Big Tech. They are now the enemy of the majority of Americans, who should take a concerted effort to destroy them."
TWTR will trend down for days and days as more bad news sinks in
Uganda blocks social media forever. Smart people.
"During the White House presser, the American public was quick to downvote Psaki’s nonsense. At 3 PM the video had 10,000 down votes.But by 7 PM YouTube came to the rescue and erased the downvotes by several thousand."
The trading platform Robinhood started stealing from the poor to give to the rich.
Liberals actually think Dorsey cares about them! 
"hey you guys ready for Obama 2.0??? looks like all these cabinet members are Obama rejects showing up again.WOW, just think we already had 8 years of NOTHING, we will get 4 more????? Make America Poor Again.MAPA.. New slogan."
"Short, Short, Short!!!!!"
"Put an end to censorship, regardless as to how you identify. Plenty of other places to make money!"
"Liberals - when you read this board, notice the seriousness in the tone of what’s going on here? Who’s side are you going to be on?"
"I did sell short heavily yesterday and made 10% , I will do it again when the time is right . I want to see TWTR disappear"
"In one of Ronald Reagan's interviews he said, and I quote. ""If facism ever comes to America it will come in the form of Liberalism"". And it has arrived exactly as Reagan predicted with Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Cook,Bezos, Gates, Pelosi, AOC and Schumer leading them."
Those holding on still believe this was a fair E L E C T I O N
"Without knowing anything about the company, a person should sell their stocks of Dorsey's companies based solely on his current appearance."
"down it goes, where it stops..... nobody knows.....10 a share ?"

"Under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek and receive news and express opinions.

Self-censorship is pervasive. 1 Eritrea 2 North Korea 3 Turkmenistan 4 Saudi Arabia 5 China 6 Vietnam 7 Iran 8 Equatorial Guinea 9 Belarus 10 Cuba"
"The BEST ETFs: ARKK, ARKW, ARKG, ARKQ, ARKF! Much better return than TWTR and lower risk! Why buy or hold TWTR?? BUY these BEST ETFs!"
"This stock is dog water, 0 pr, no earnings, freer than a sample at costco."
Done with Twitter. These social media companies just went down a rabbit hole from which there is no escape.
I mean seriously who in their right mind is buying at this price? This stock was $20 in March. It wasn't even worth that much then.
"Parler should go public, they will get a lot of new business, because of Twitter,Facebook, and Apple"
The swamp is still draining.
gone! so long Twitter.
"Oppenheimer getting there investors out, before it collapses"
Parler jumps to number one on app store followed by gab. If your a twitter shareholder this should concern you on your investment.
"Last week on: CNBC - Fast Money analyst/guest - Dan Nathan called TWTR stock "" TOAST "" going forwardFOX BUSINESS - On Charles Payne Show - Fund manager- Mark Tepper of Strategic Weatlh said hee unloaded all his fund shares of Twitter because Twitter block his tweet just telling ""all "" Georgians to vote.Mark said that was the last straw for him on stifing free speech and saw this a negative sign for Twitter's future subscriber growth."
Just wondering about all of the beloved Twitter investors. Did anyone let you know they would sabotage the company and destroy well over 5 billion in shareholder value? Just wondering why you care about a company that doesn’t care for you? Maybe you are all staying around for the dividend o wait yeah. They most really care about the stock holder.
This stock is going to break out and then break down. So happy I bought oil when it was negative.
Delete twitter fast.
"half of its customers are leaving for what thy did, as in 50% drop...that is worse than what happened to myspace in one year."
A very smart liberal friend of mine who enjoyed leaving negative replies to Trumps tweets said Twitter is violating his constitutional right to communicate with his government. Think about that- censorship cuts both ways. Wasn't it after all a court that ruled Trump cant ban people from his twitter because it violates their constitutional rights?
"Dorsey should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom for courageously silencing Donnie’s megaphone, knowing full well it would result in a temporary loss of daily active users."
Some people won’t be able sell in the 40’s when the market opens. Too many sells/shorts.
"Joe still using Twitter. No worries.We could keep the eyes on the earning report of FB.If FB goes well, TWTR will goes well too.FB is still on the rally. the momentum between $46.8 - $48 is normal.Once the rally path confirms, TWTR will reach to $60."
"If 75 Million of us ALL sell TWTR, APPL, GOOG, CRM, FB and AMZN the stocks ARE going to GO DOWN. They are ALL GROSSLY Overvalued and will go down at some point anyway. Lock In Gains NOW !!"
Short-sellers unite!
"Hey Twitter investors, Dorsey doesn’t care about you, he’s made his money! Better sell quick before it’s too late!"

Yahoo the pioneer of social media. Rise of the Phoenix?
Twitter lost $10 Billion in one week. Just think you could run some African countries for a year with that kind of money.
Wait to see how many accounts TWTR loss -40 -60 milions
"Personally as a trader I have enjoyed the volatility immensely, however before the earnings come out I will also be fully out."
Gravity is very strong
Honest question other than just saying Twitter will tank. Best strike prices for puts seeing as earning are feb 9th? Puts will print
"I would suggest using G A B and d issenter the free speech browser there are some fringe elements but most people are using them because they are truly concerned about repression of free speech in the United States. The best thing about D issenter is you can add your own comments to any webpage without Orwellian like censorship. Also, try bizfluence an alternative to LinkedIn. TWTR is on the decline, without diversity of opinion you simply don't have democracy, people are voting with their feet."
definitely trending upwards great job twitter you the man
Dont let jack dorsey control peoples speech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"there are many alt social media sites, delete twitter and FB"
Californians are begging the taxpayers to bail out their failed state. Please use it to fight the typhoid and plague you’ve got going on there.

On Oct 29 2020 TWTR stock lost 25% on a bad news. W/O any big change or improvements they inched there way back up with a 2G stock buyback. Now don't expect them to get out of this one. The TWTR platform was a big part of that on going disastrous vicious political game. You can't eat your cake and have it. It's time for them to pay for their greedy irresponsible behavior. Early this week many will start to keep their distance from TWTR and the stock price will fall hard and fast
Get your Stimulus Check by Shorting Twitter!
"Remember MySpace, dBase, Wordperfect, Novell, Wordstar, Lotus? Yeah, neither does anyone else. That is where Twitter is heading. To the scrapheap of apps that have failed to keep up with their customers’ needs."

everyday it goes down another dollar....
The discourse on twitter all of a sudden is substantive and reality-based. Users love it. Great business decisions have been made over the past month.
Democrat lawmakers introduce bill in favor of nationwide election cheating.
"Lock THEM Up! One of six men federally charged on suspicion of being involved in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year pleaded guilty Wednesday.Ty Garbin, 25, signed an agreement pleading guilty in federal court in Michigan to the sole charge against him -- kidnapping conspiracy.According to the agreement, Garbin will continue to cooperate with prosecutors against the five other defendants, all of whom have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping conspiracy."
sell Amazon $AMZN Sell Facebook $FB SELL Twitter $TWTR ....GET OUT!!!!!!
No people need TWTR but TWTR needs people. When you leave it you will find that you don't need it to live.
"Just wait until the class action lawsuits come out. Then, you'll have a company that already doesn't make money, with a shrinking subscriber base, and a bunch of legal fee expenses and/or fines."
"Twitter MUST fall. Dorsey and his sort have to learn they don't speak for us, don't regulate us, don't control us, and won't silence us. This is a shot which will be heard around the world..."
I wonder when the panic selling starts
AI is being rolled out everywhere. Banks love AI already. It will replace all kinds of repititive jobs. Even at Mickey Dee's. It will be IBM Watson taking your order at the drive through. The burger will be made by machines inside. The only employee is the person who keeps it working. So more layoff's are coming. Covid-19 was the excuse to lay people off btw. Oh and I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI seen it all coming. It's here. Your jobs are gone.
The man didn't even campaign from the basement. The media campaigned for him.
"SHORTING TWITTER, AMAZON, FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE. GOODBYE FANG. LOL"

"If Twitter is pro child porn, why does it censor news about Hunter’s laptop?"
"Stock quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good"
All this talk about boycotting Twitter. The worst offender of free speech may actually be YAHOO. Notice how the comment section was completely eliminated months before the election?
cancelled my Twitter and FB accounts feels so free of the little commies telling Americans how to feel and what you can and cannot say...tank tank tank
Divest Twitter from your 401K
"""I don't understand why there aren't uprisings in the streets"" Nancy Pelosi"

"I don't invest in the stock, but was a user for a decade. I'm from Canada, but had to delete the app. It was a seriously toxic place man. I flipped to conservative from liberal, generally mind my own business, and was only tweeting support and replies on conservative politician's posts and the hate I was getting was insane. Ended up deleting after some rando figured out where I worked and lived."
I cancelled Twitter because they are not focused on shareholder value. Their new mission is political cancel culture. I’m out.
Sell this #$%$ company!

"Easy short getting punished severely. Much more pain to come. Sell, and never return."
friendly advice. who ever is buying around $46.50. its not a support line anymore. it was broke days ago. thus stock will go to $45 very quickly.
"TWTR is the most overvalued big tech stock. Now it's #1 carnival attraction is gone, get ready for a slaughter"
Keep shorting TWTR !!! The first sell signal is when the stock falls below it's 50 day moving average. The last chance to sell when the stock falls below it's 200 day moving average.Average Price: 47.6152 (50-day) 39.0893 (200-day)
Twitter and Facebook are selling your personal information to third-parties and even to bad actors outside the USA. That's why your id is being stolen people. They've been caught in the act.

"If and when the market reverses course, Twitter will lead the pack of bears to winter hibernation. Right now, it seems that FB and AMZN are propping up TWTR. But it's turning into a lonely outpost over there. From a vibrant gold-rush bastion to an abandoned old ghost town..."
Fire Jack Dorksey and the stock rallies 20 dollars in 5 minutes.
if Parler goes public the stock would soar.
I just deactivated my Twitter account and deleted the app from my phone like many others here. I just don’t like the thought that they have the power to deactivate and ban me if they so wish. I tend not to hang out where I’m not welcomed unless I relinquish control of my basic rights as a human being. I don’t own this stock and never will.
Why would anyone own this stock with the Cliff it is heading for?
Deleted acct for TWTR this evening. Banning free speech today. 1/2 of accounts will delete very soon.Wish I had shorted this today should have been able to predict this move.
Deactivated my account yesterday. Never had a position in the stock. GLTA.

Twitter to 0
Will fall more after Jan 20th when there is no reason to be on this platform. Lights out
37 coming soon.
"If you’re investing your money into Twitter, then you have too much money on your hands, I figure and if you’re buying now, you deserve to lose  Invest in something worthwhile."
"BIg news. Twitter buys Revue giving authors/posters a way to monetize their audience on Twitter. This has been something needed for a long time. Now that people can make money on Twitter, expect higher user engagement and more people pushing their online audiences to Twitter. Get out now shorts, while you still have your shirts."
Where's Antonio? Where's Brenda? Where's Bull? Where's Hunter? I need someone to laugh at.
Twitter no more...
"White House to be painted in Chinese Red, to thank the CCP and Dominion for stealing the 2020 election."
parler filed lawsuit against amazon saying they are colluding to support twitter and judge agreed to reistate parler
It’s nice of big tech to build their own antitrust case for us.
"Jack Dorsey didn't expect his stock value to decline. He has 76% of shares held by Institutions, they must be concerned. Mark Zuckerbergk has sold $650M of his FB shares in the past few months. And Tim Cook CEO of Apple just gave an interview. He never does interviews. It looks like they are all trying to do damage control. If these shares keep dropping, don't be surprised by possible management changes."
Where's Beijing Bidens covid plan? Another 4000 dead under Joe Bidens America.
It’s rather appropriate that this thing takes a deep dive. It’s lost billions of shareholders money through absolutely horrific management and decision making. The real question is how do freaks like Dorsey get into positions like this??
"I for one am dropping all of my social media accounts and with the money saved, sending it to Mar-a-Lago so that President Dennison can continue to pay for his money-losing golf courses, raise capital for his upcoming debt renewals and pay for his mounting legal bills.Oh, and boycott the PGA. They cancelled their championship tour at President Dennison's golf course.May Rudy can sue them and recoup some of the bigly losses?MAGA - McDonalds and Golf Again!"
I had 46 twitter accounts.. 45 fake and one real.. Cancelled all of them and now I have just one on Parler..
We Must control all Propaganda !!!
"TWTR thrives on controversy and open discussion. Without it, REAL QUESTION, what is its value?"
"RIP Twtter, you won't be missed!"
"Joe's keeping his promise..He's bringing back affirmative action, quotas, forced busing and reparations.....Get ready to see your suburban neighborhood turned into Detroit......"
"Sold all my Apple shares and split the considerable proceeds between QCOM and AVGO. Next up, I was waiting to get the iPhone 12 for 5G capability ( I have an iPhone 8). Guess what? Going with the Samsung Galaxy (don't know what model yet). At least I know they will have the latest Snapdragon chipset from QCOM which is the best by far in the industry. It's going to be a little of a learning curve since I never used anything but iPhones, but I refuse to support in any way a company that censors people. It is up to us to make these companies understand this is not China or a banana republic dictatorship."
Twitter Loses 5 BILLION In ONE DAY!! Major Backlash As Tech Companies Go TOO FAR!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSAXzukTWb8&fbclid=IwAR1Bex9KDLGIL5qDvnoNJFO9IFYWV9sV5j226eRY8zg-1IPLxSnDA619FU4
Sell this stock. Stand for free speach
Heavy selling on Monday over action reaction. This is not going to end well for Twitter.
We the People aren't going to take this much longer! America is about to get really awoke and it's going to start with places like Twitter and Facebook. How long do you really think those places will stay standing once a civil war starts?
Dorsey thinks the North Korean model is what's best.
"QUESTION- Is it an act of treason for a high ranking elected official to render financial assistance, encouragement and public endorsement of anarchists charged with the felonious crimes of rioting, the destruction of private and public property, looting and arson? On June 1, 2020 Vice President elect tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota.""In a few days Harris will be one heartbeat away from becoming the POTUS, which is a chilling reality. We the people must DO something about this dreadful situation. Immediately, contact your House Representative and insist that they draft articles of impeachment based upon Harris' own words. Please move from the stands of a message and join the fight that is being conducted on the field."
"As expected it dipped in the AH, as the day traders rushed for the exit. Going to collapse another $10 next week."

Timber!!!
"Let's see- NASDAQ is up today, but Twitter dropped.Might be the start of a terrible week for Twitter."
"I don't really support shorting stocks in general. However, shorting Twitter is a win for democracy!"
"I think Twitter has forgot that Americans will make you but they can break you , too!!!"
Short this to the core of the earth
I’m making a genuine plea to all people with a modicum of common sense. Please deactivate your accounts and sell any stock you have in this miserable company with its outrageous and despicable Management.
I deactivated my account yesterday and it seems a lot of other people have had the same idea.
"Wow. Can you see advertising dollars disappearing as now those that advertise must realize that they are appealing to people who know people who know people. Why would anyone buy products or services unless you are one of those in favor of the #cancculture? Dorsey has fully expose his tyranny to all. So out of touch with the common man/women and the heart of what makes America, America."
rush limbaugh cancelled his account. 80 million followers
Worse viewership of televised presidential inauguration was yesterday. Priceless!
"Going south. Will be attending in future. Anti trust action coming. Sell, Sell, Sell."
"I dont have any shares of TWTR but I can't wait till pre market opens, hell I just as well sit up and watch a movie till open, cause I'm to excited to sleep."
Jack is probably surrounded by 10 guys 24hrs a day right now.
"Sponsored post:Twitter's growth over the long term is said to be its ability to connect advertisers with users. Check disclaimer in the landing page. Meanwhile, these other companies are immersed as one of the most active e-commerce communities in the world. Amazing, isn't it? To find out more check this out: http://b.link/PotentiallyTrillionWorthMarketResearch"
I see this stock in the single digits in less than 6 months. If the only people allowed on Twitter are all in lock step in opinion and thought it will become extremely boring. What ever happened to the concept of diversity? This company has destroyed itself. I’m out tomorrow. Selling out of Apple and Facebook as well. We are not a Marxist country and companies that promote policies against freedom of speech should not be supported. This must stop.
"Greg Abbott has already DEMANDED the return of the Texas national guard. It was an abuse of power to use them, and now that dementia Joe has used them, they are sleeping out in the cold."
Twitter banned the hashtag #1984 yesterday. What does that tell you about them?
"Streisand effect, twitter continues to ban people and it causes the Streisand effect :) just wait give this time and it will be irrelevant as myspce"
Well you had your chance to get out lefty’s . You were warned! @Jack don’t care he’s busy sticking needles in his arm ! 
Pretty soon robinhood is going to start cancelling accounts if you short TWTR or FB
"I'm a Patriot, I would NEVER endorse a Communist company which is what this is!! Buy PUTS people, show them they can't censor the AMERICAN people!!"
Sold all my shares and now I’m going to short it all the way to the $20 I originally bought it for
"Not a dip, the beginning of a spiral."
Could someone please tell me who got banned from Twitter & Facebook during all the BLM Riots?
late day pumping beginning at 3:30. Don't fall for it
"If you're a patriot, and you care about freedom of the press. then deactivate your Twitter account now. We must send a message."
Who do these tech companies think they are by holding us hostage? Down with this stock!
I keep my short positions over night
Hope TWTR and other platforms that decided to become arms of the woke left mob will find their way to irrelevance.
twtr reports Feb 9 lost thousands if not millions users.
"Delete twitter and FB, have some dignity"
"Twitter stock losing steam, smart money is exiting as fast as they can"
"Guys what's your parler accounts, post them in a reply so we can follow each other. My parler is @DropShock. Deactivated twitter after years of use, it's not enough we delete twitter but we also deactivate our accounts so that during the earnings report they can see a huge drop in accounts"
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS...THE PARTY'S OVER......ALL GOOD THINGS MUST END........ADIOS BWAAAAAAH!!!
Short this stock and you’ll make a lot money! They are toast!
"After reading all the comments here, I feel like I just got outta a triple K meeting"
Investors REALLY need to view what Jack just said about suppressing a lot more free speech. I think that’s what you call DD.
Byyyyyeeee Twitter
"With the Veritas Tapes and prior to 9am on Wednesday, Dorsey and his Marxist staff has set this up for a collapse of Titanic proportions. Shareholders lawsuits will be filed in mass."
Twitter CEO took up a short position before announcing Trump ban. No doubt about it.
Where's Hunter?
Wow!Twitter has new numbers today!POTUS46 has 5.4 millions followers. POTUS45 archived account has 33.3 millions followers so 50 millions have left Twitter in 2 weeks.
"If this falls $5 today, I am cracking open champagne."
when the POTUS speaks at 3 today this will start rapidly descending
This is falling a long way today after Project Veritas let out the tape of Dorsey.
Domino effect worldwide.
"India is getting ready to ban Twitter india has a population of 1,386,604,720. Consider how man users are in this country. Less viewers less money no growth for Twitter. I keep posting this information and it keeps getting removed pass it on."
if you like it at $48 you'll love it at $18.
Short Twitter and defund a liberal
"Just got rid of Amazon. will work on getting weaned from FB, Google, Twitter, and Apple tomorrow or however long it takes. Also created two new email addresses using proton. As for search engine still looking. Any ideas out there?"
it may be green right now but that trend line ain't looking to good for the day...or the week.
Sold
"When you see proof of Zuckerberg and his orders of the child hormone from kids murdered for ritual and 'medical' purposes, then a list of horrifics who took such treatments, eventually it becomes impossible to hide the facts."
"Why did TWTR do what it did....look at their Board members and their countries of birth and dual citizenship.....China, Iran....."
Bye Jack
Proof positive that mixing politics and business/sports is a terrible idea.
This stock going to 10.00 closed all my accounts Freedom wins

Which side would Twitter have chosen in the Revolutionary War? Would it have mattered?
"Truth is a scary thing, when you’re on the wrong side of it."
Defund the democrats
"As the internet's sewer system, maybe Twtr can seek regulation as a public utility."
"Sell, sell, sell."
Real reason for twitters success was the following Trump had and it brought millions of users who otherwise wouldn’t be on Twitter or care to use Twitter. Not a good day and probably worse to come for this company
Delete these 2 un-american apps. $FB $TWTR
A lots people is selling share soon..will see happening
"So, why didn't gov't just print endless $$ during the great depression?"
Hahaha.... Twitter worst performing stock in the S&P so far -12% YTD Great job!
Deactivated my twitter account. I find it comical that when you click deactivate the only message you get is: Sorry to see you go. #GoodByeWho knows what will happen to the stock. I sold my mere 400 shares in my retirement account Friday. I'm out because I cannot be a part of a company that is clearly attacking our rights.
More antitrust lawsuits coming for these 2 commie companies. $FB $TWTR
"-5% here, -5% tomorrow, then the next day and so on and so on. Next thing you know you broke! That’s how the market works. Very unforgiving!"
"Id like to know how many shares Oppenheimer sold into their ""price raise"". Or if they received any kinda of compensation of any kind.This is the type of stuff, regardless of political leanings, is what our government should be working to rid us of!"
Breaking: jack Dorsey calls to bring George Washington back to life so he can be properly cancelled and impeached.
User numbers going down................sell your twitter shares.Delete your twitter accounts!
"investment meant to follow money not tool to press political views, you will lose"
"Americans and their rights are being abolished one by one. TWTR is just a cog in the wheel of elimination of your 1st Amendment right. Next comes AOC’s taking down of “opposition speech”. First, they came after the Jew, but I wasn’t a Jew. Then they came after the Gypsies but I wasn’t a Gypsy. Then they..... etc.etc.By the time they came after me there was no one left to stand up and fight. So true these days!"
BLM being told they won't be getting any more shareholder's money handed to them by Jack in 2021...
Saddened that people still buy these social media stocks.
Sold all social media this morning. Its going to tank. People will not stand for the censorship if we do this country will fail

Eighty million Twtr users moving to 8 other outlets based on blockchain. Cuts revs in half.

jack will be fired before summer.stock price will be below 5 a share soon.
"Let's use some of our profits generated by shorting and buying puts on Twitter, to help low-income people who will be hit hard from rising prices for gasoline, electricity, and basic necessities like groceries caused by thoughtless executive orders."
"If you cherish America and Free Speech you MUST deactivate Twitter and FB as I have immediatelyJack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg , Tim Cook and Google are BIG BROTHER and it does not matter what your politics are.These are frightening times for censorship and we must show BIG tech they cannot control us!Congress has failed to protect us and are bought and paid for by these same companiesThis is the just the beginning if we do not stand up as a free people!!!!!!"
when a social network such as Twitter becomes hated by half of America as it is today the chances of it regaining its good times are pretty slim
Twitter allows Jack Morrissey to tweet Magakids should go hat first into a wood chipper. This company should burn for the violent words people are allowed to hide behind.
"Game over, folks! It's coming from Italy! Run or you will regreat!"
"Harrison Smith on American Journal Infowars, just claimed that something big is going down today. He claims a military source has told him to expect something big today."
The Silent Majority has spoken
Twitter share holders you have already lost 20% in the last 7 trading days !The million dollar question is how much more money are you willing to loose ? Another 20-40
"Jack Dorsey Please note A clear and unambiguous signal- Put option volume increasing relative to calls....Jack,,,,, I suggest you bring an extra pair of jockey shorts to the office,"
"Check out GEVO, VET for alternative stock. Gevo 0$ debt free, VET hit by Covid hard but since they’re strong they’ll bounce back"
Twitter going down because it's financially unable to make money. and that's good because they are enemy of people and censor tool. besides Jihadi Jack is addicted to different heavy drugs and can't think at all.
"I can’t push my idea enough to make it matter unfortunately, but some of you will get it. We have entered an incredibly bad repeat of history led by a 78 year old lifetime politician that has learned how to lie well above all other things in his life."
"Tomorrow is the beginning of the end for the stock market, economy, and our country, Democrats will destroy it all, it won't happen in 1 day, 1 week, or even 1 year but will slowly do so over time, and the ones that will suffer the most are the young people who will be burdened with the enormous trillions of dollars of debt and a hopeless future for our country with the Democrat rule and their policies! Was just watching the video of Summer Breeze by Seals and Crofts on Youtube from 1972, takes me back to simpler times of the 70's when the world was a much nicer place to live in and life was less complicated and so much better, so glad I lived through those times, these poor young people of today...they'll never know!"
"If you advertise on twitter, I won't be purchasing any of your products."
Red by opening
"It's one thing to block far-right fanatics and extremists. However, blocking an entire political party is unacceptable. This was way over the line. I enjoyed having political discussions/debates with my Conservative and liberal counterparts. I will be deleting my Twitter and FB due to this as well..."
The haircut here is just beginning.
volume today is 54 million! on a normal day its 16 million...there is a lot of big money in here trying to save it...but it wont make it over all.
Just announced: Xi Jinping will be officiating the swearing in of BeijingBiden.Takeover of America complete.

Why is my comment about Nancy P gone?
"Last night there was a priated video of Dorsey addressing his employees. Key take aways from his majesty:-Twitter will continue to censor right wing tweets-He has the moral authority to ""protect"" the american public.Can anyone remember what Josef Stalin said about opposing views in Pravda?"
"We should cherish FREEDOM OF SPEECH"" not to suppress it. This is what Dorsey is doing. He should fire employees who are advocating it. Twitter is publicly traded company. The shareholders are in charge not employees."
"85, yup 85 million will be gone,lol, jack good job"
"I don't know about shareholders suing but even as a private frim there is arguably many laws broken since it's a publicly traded company violating First Amendment Rights, These actions would be more under the Securities Exchange Commission rule and TWTR could become a candidate for Delisting under the very similar and policy invoked and utilized this week to to delist China Telecom's. But way before delisting TWTR will be trading at $10.00. The other repercussions I'm seeing on Dark Cloud websites are lists of the TWTR Advertisers people who fight for Freedom of Speech have listed and instructed to boycott those consumer products. I think 75 Million to 80 Million people boycotting those products will get those Advertisers to pull their support and advertisements from TWTR by the end of next week."
Nothing satisfies me more than the falling price of TWTR.
"Sold my shares and feel great,"
Has Jack Goebbels Dorsey been invited to a White House dinner of almond milk and goat hair pasta? Sleepy Joe has waiting for him the cabinet level position of Minister of Disinformation.

This company is responsible for all the chaos and division of people in the US. Don't forget this .
Democrats on election night
What was Twitter before Trump? Nothing. What will it be after Trump? Nothing. Why are you investing in a sinking ship?
Longs should run for there life’s
They will lose 50% of their subscribers.
"Not only did Twitter interfere with the election, I have proof that YouTube did as well. Silicone Valley is a bastion of tyrannical oligarchs."
"So you stole my vote, but you are not getting my money. I am not investing in leftist media."
Users are losing thousands of followers every single day. The pillow man got suspended today..one of many. Instagram is forcing users to follow fake POTUS and they keep unfollowing.
Unfortunately I see a future where liberals only shop at businesses that support their views. The liberal economy will be in ruins as conservatives continue to pay for their welfare checks.
Signed up for Parler earlier tonight and just deleted Twitter.
No free speech for you Mr. John Q. American! So says Xi Jingping and his right hand man Jack. Sell.

problem is say a large company looking to go to the cloud now realize they will be held to the standard of the Twitter ceo.. this will kick facebook and twitter to the curb as well as amazon. I would in no way move an app to AWS under current conditions NO WAY!! and i just sold my stocks related to these socilaist companies as i want no part of communist movement here in the usa
"And I wonder if people are selling the mutual funds that hold twitter?Is that a thought, or something to think about ."

Contact every website that has twitter and facebook on their site and tell them you are not doing business with them until they remove facebook and twitter from their business website! If you shop at a store leave your cart when they tell you they have facebook and twitter on their website.

Shouldn’t a company loosing money for so long be in bankruptcy ? They are heading for a shutdown. Workers treated poorly. The caw union is coming.
Puts outweigh the calls 3 to 1. Twitter wont see green for awhile...
"The Democratic Party had no problem with the burning of cities because they don’t live there and the election process was a farce. But,,,an assault on Nancy’s office,,, oh that’s just wrong.

Do not buy puts. Actually short the stock. Puts wont do it.
SELL before it’s too late. User lost and law suits will definitely drag Twitter down. JD is not protecting the investors. Too bad for us.
The BIG Drop is coming
"How much is a dollar worth to you, to twitter its worth more than freedom"
Higher Lows and Higher Highs! Our Beautiful Bird Loves To Soar! This Is One Red Hot Chick;)
I just canceled my Twitter account. Feels good
"My prediction is always very conservative! When I say 37 by the end of next week, it’ll turn out to be 33 or below! LOL"
Project Veritas has recordings of the CEO of Twitter discussing the censorship of the Titan .. they say that there are multiple people within Twitter who have volunteered to denounce their boss !!

"Expect a number of positive recs from analysts in the coming days to support those large investors, institutions and mutual funds who have large investments in this Mao Company. Remember they did they for Enron as it was collapsing."
"Longs, if you like TWTR at $44, you're gonna love it at $22. Sell 1 now and buy 2 back later."
"Short to 0, free money"
"Veritas has now released a video from a whistle blower that Jack Dorsey stated he is going to continue to censor conservatives as a larger project going forward. The video is posted on gateway pundit for investors to see. If I didn't know any better I wold swear Jack Dorsey is on a suicide mission involving Twitter. As a result I see Twitter continuing it's downward spiral which is roughly down 18% off the highs on January 6th. I don't see that changing as Twitter will reach the thirties over the coming weeks. This film won't do investors any good who believe Jack should try and repair those on the right which make up half of the nation. My guess is that Twitter lost at least 44 million of the 88 million subscribers who followed Trump. So you might say the ""Cancel Culture"" cancelled Twitter!"
Janney Montgomery broker told me many investors buying the put contracts. Just saying
sell
well that is great to me because they were not making a dime before TRUMPS tweets in fact they were on their way out!! TRUMP MADE TWITTER WHAT IT IS TODAY. I hope twitter fails so bad !! FREEDOM OF SPEECH !
Bye-Bye Donnie

Lol did retail Robin hoody’s just get out of school?
FCC going to take control. Like they were suppose to 20 years ago.

Jack Dorsey won’t need all these employees after he looses half of his business! Awww the poor liberal putz s will be jobless
The only reason this price gets pumped because tons of shares need to be dumped.
This company is toast. Save yourself
There she blows. welcome to fake News on that upgrade.
"Blocked from social media, extremists discuss turning to radios to plan attacks, FCC warns!Maybe you should try smoke signals"
Parler is on its way back.Signs of life!https://parler.com/
Ouch! Down 3% once again.
Twitter suspended the Gateway Pundit account again on Tuesday for another week for violating the “civic integrity” rules.This is a new Orwellian category that allows Twitter to ban any conservative at will.
what's the dividend on twitter?
Watch for a flood of shareholder lawsuits against Twitter as the stock price continues to drop. The reason for the decrease is executive mismanagement.
"“The mob was fed lies,” McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”"
"Maybe limiting free speech to only the left might have been a bad idea, lol."
"Time to take out the stop losses, when the resistance is gone, this will be in freefall..."
"Oh and lets impeach a president without any hearing or evidence... just based on hearsay, media reports and doctored video. Thank GOD it’s only a political stunt and means absolutely zero."
Everybody get your popcorn and drinks and have a seat. The show is about to begin!!! Would love too see a 20% dive today.
All Republicans cancel your Twitter and sell your stock. Make a stand Now
Twitter getting crushed in AHs. Will probably open up down 10% on Monday. Losing half your subs will crush any revenue model you had.
"The brand new Birdwatch program is doomed to fail as people will not want their posts ""cancelled"" by incredibly biased left-wing radials. This new policy will only motivate millions of conservatives to leave Twitter. The blue bird has been injured in recent weeks and is desperately trying to save itself from a financial catastrophe. Too little, too late."
tank twitter you deserve everything you get now.....let's censor Twitter!!!!!!
"Now Youtube bans Steve Bannon Podcast one of the top in the country. Problem is TWTR, GOOG, FB can not ban the platforms who practice freedom of speech. There will be a Nasdaq disaster on Monday."
TWTR CEO reminds me oh how #$%$ Germany was started. I laugh everyday how their CEO takes action to censor people and fails to see how he is following the same path as so many evil dictators did before him only with out the same technology. Anyone who works there seems to be ok with this so what does that tell you about their company. Amazing.
Tanking bigly in after hours trades
Twitter is up 7.47% to 51.79
"They are trying a head fake !!! Short all you can. Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more.

I believe the current CEO of Twitter has chosen the path that was given to him by more powerful people. He is not actually capable of making these waves of change decisions on his own while spending 90% of his time disconnecting from his worst fear...people.
I have joined the party and left #twitter #deactivate #sellstock

Time for some of you Twitter insiders to call Project Veritas to get your 15 minutes of fame and do a good thing for decency!
When I look at TWTR I reflect on the dead sparrow I saw on the road today.
remember what happened to telephone in 1980. MA BELL WAS BROKEN UP.This will happen.
Back to the important topic short this to 10.00
Ha! It's on the Alex Jones show now. Tune into Infowars people. He's dishing it out on Twitter and Facebook.
"Given stellar performance by Snap, I expect similar by Tweet. Fb is a pit of nohtzees and self deprecating haters. But Snap and Tweet are the bright favorites. Nobody welcomes parler and gab salesmen into the break room to meet the creative people."
The trend is on. There will be a right leaning app for every leftist app. Every leftist app will see half its base leave. It will be slow in the beginning and get fast later as more and more people join new apps.
It's time to sell. Going down with Twitter will be the same as going down with titanic.

"How did Twitter's stock price ascend to where it is today considering the facts it has a negative P/E ratio, and does not pay a dividend? The answer is large revenue growth projections. Recent actions made by the CEO have greatly diminished Twitter's ability to grow their revenue in the foreseeable future, coupled this with the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab, looming class action lawsuits from disgruntled stockholders, and the recent revelation of its association with child sex abuse, the big players on Wall Street are going to give Twitter's stock price a crew cut in the not to distance future."
Another Monday and another short to put in. I think overall market is going to have a bad week and twitter is poised to lead the way down.
I've deactivated my Twitter account.
Dorsey is buying shares to prop up the share price. LOL
Jack Dorseys Twitterstock will go back to 2016 levels and lower !Up pre market they are letting institutions out first
"I would not touch Twitter. Oh yeah, I bought puts."
Jack Dorsey to speak !!!!! Who cares what he has to say ? Not me the damage is done
When TWTR doesn't like what you say--they mute you. Some social media platform that is. I hope the company stock price gets hit.
Selling intensifying
Yep silence sure is violence. It especially shows when state governors and mayors allow violence in their cities and stay hush-hush about it. The violence only gets worse￼
Just wait til Jack sells a large portion of his holdings before the imminent collapse.
Deleted my account and not going back!
"Once Parler is back up and with the GabExdous in full swing this think will be toast. Dorsey knows this, which is why he is bleating on about creating something decentralised, he doesn't care about shareholders, just how to make money from the next technological pivot."

"I can't wait to see the TWTR bloodbath on Mon. The stock was already overpriced, and the market is way overdue for a correction, esp. tech stocks. The Twitter employees who urged this censorous action will be paying in their retirment accounts. Karma."
Let me get this right. Twitter just got rid of the biggest draw on it's platform and just told all his followers to go F'm selves? Puts are going to be very expensive for this stock on Monday.
February 9 is doomsday for Twitter. Let?s see if they can #$%$ their way out of their earnings.
i think twitter has lost 50 percent of their users who would never come back since people found non censoring alternative solution

"One thing the board is forgetting and this may get deleted again! Once Trump takes out Biden in the final round (next week), you can be sure section 230 will be destroyed and his executive order from 2018 will delist this #$%$ from the Nasdaq. Outside of everything else, this will be worth $0."
"""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie.

Amazing this turkey is still gobbling. Within the next 48 hours you will see it necessary to cook and put it on the table with all the condiments.
Jack Dorsey bears a striking resemblance to Grigori Rasputin wouldn't you say?
"I can’t wait for the class action lawsuits against Twitter by it’s shareholder for corporate malfeasance. Imagine a PUBLIC company stifling the one commodity they sell, and then removing that commodity from the very people they are selling to."
The government don’t like companies who has more power over its citizens than them. This was an eye opener for them. They will break this company apart just as they did with big oil in the early 1900’s. Sherman Antitrust Act guarantee!
"The Capitol Police has more than 2000 officers and an annual budget of $500 million, all to patrol 2 square miles of land. We don't need permanent fencing around the seat of US democracy. We need them to do their job.The EOs coming out of Washington are not what Americans want."

"Texans are already talking about secession. They would fight to make it so. If Texas walks, most of the old South would also walk out."
This is one of the best head and shoulders formation's I have ever seen since Enron or Worldcom.
"No amount of Yahoo! censoring on this message board can prop up TWTR but for so long. I'm excited about this trade! So much so, I doubled down early this morning. And TWTR is the queen of censorship, with rich uncles Jeff Z and Jeff B on the right and left. It may work for the Washington Post and Facebook, but Twitter needs open and honest tweeting to succeed. There's no emotional attachment to the platform. I, along with millions of others, simply and summarily deactivated my account. Others were de-platformed or censored or put on some kind of Dorsey-invented probation. The whole thing is a joke and will be a laughingstock at some point down the line in history!"

"Twitter's mission statement:The mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve – and do not detract from – a free and global conversation.Everyone? Really? Everyone except for the POTUS and others associated with him?Notice that Twitter's claim that business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve - and do not detract from - a free and global conversation.So they have just thrown their business model out of the window.Since this company doesn't turn a profit, spends money all kinds of ways, doesn't even really have a mission statement that they are abiding by, why not just dump it?Why do you think there is anything here moving forward?"
"Remember the words Leonardo and Obama. The country will soon see how they been played. Can you imagine a left wing outlet AP polls show 39% of the public thinks there was election fraud. The only thing I can say after it is all out there, the 39 percent will increase substantially while TWTR crashes BIGLY!!!!"
More pain today for the cult.
Booom short depressed
Twitter has continued censoring/banning accounts with opposing viewpoints. Why would anyone support/vote for this? Why would anyone think this is a good investment for their hard-earned money? This has to end. Let your money speak. Cancel Twitter.

Gee I wonder why Jack Dorsey doesn't want regulation and the government to be able to track the $50 million in Bitcoin that Twitter purchased.
"Across the board, the financial establishment has reacted with outrage to the surge in what previously were considered dead stocks. Industry insiders have taken to TV to decry the amateur investors, hedge fund billionaires have demanded the government intervene on their behalf, and investment firms have bailed out their short-selling colleagues who lost tens of billions of dollars when the stocks rose, instead of falling as they predicted."
What is the punishment for lying to Congress under oath?
Just wait until employees with stock options start quitting
Uganda shut down all social media after the country’s longtime leader accused Facebook of taking sides in the upcoming presidential election.
"Why does the media facilitate Don Lemon trying to associate conservatives with any nasty hate group he can think of, including the clan and national socialists (such comparison being made on the basis of identity politics and not on true actions or beliefs--just whether he can produce an example of a bad person who happens to vote one way or the other and branding everyone that way)? It is a fact that no Republicans owned any slaves a year before the civil war, that the Republican party was formed to eliminate slavery, that the Republican party introduced civil rights legislation, and that the Democratic party (actions, not mere identity) supported slavery, jim crow, etc., well into the 1960s or so. In fact, why tear down statutes of dead people when you have the actual organization that did all that, alive and well today? Reparations? Go talk to the Democratic party."
Love to watch this go down. Who on Earth would buy garbage which was selling for $20 a few months ago when it had twice as many users.
All my friend cancel Twitter! FB they still have some pics! Let’s see!
Ya the only reason I had Twitter was to see what POTUS says next !

I remember safely rioting this spring.....then I went to the beach to spread the coronavirus while patronizing local restaurants.What happened to riots where there was no evidence of spreading virus? What has changed?
Why won’t Twitter remove hateful antifa accounts if they care so much about inciting violence?
"Mr. Jack Dorsey from $TWTR and $SQ, the right to freedom of opinion is of fundamental importance, NEVER forget that,freedom of speech will always WIN, big money or big tech must focus on business and innovation, not banning people because they have an opinion... right or wrong is up to the people to decide , think twice! GLTA"
"Forget shorting Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Those companies are not nearly as vulnerable to business drop as Twitter is. They will do their own thing tomorrow, but Twitter will be dying like there is no tomorrow."
Whoever is buying this stock is throwing their money away. $30 by their earnings. Almost a 50% drop in a month. It will keep dropping from there.

"This is going to wake people up to how pointless Social Media actually is. Who really cares about people you went to school or worked with 20 years ago, there's plenty of good reason you lost contact with them. You grew up and moved on. Who cares what total strangers think about anything? Unless you are a sad sad ,am who cannot find a girlfriend in real life. Find something else which works for your family and REAL friends (not strangers) use that instead. Seriously delete Twitter."
"Shareholders, do explain how dismissing millions of eyeballs from your platform is a positive. This is a mess that can’t be cleaned up"
Goldman Sach upgraded the target price of Snap Chat at the price of $70 today. We must write to the Twitter board and demand a resignation of Jack Dorsey. Snap Chat doesn't have to spend a billion dollars to do stock buyback and the price has already gone over $51 with the higher target price of $70. Twitter has not even re test the 2014 high of $57 dollars while Snap Chat keeps making new high. What does this tell you!! Twitter stock price will not improve as long as we keep Jack Dorsey on board as a part time CEO.
"Just deactivated my account. No need for it, EVER."

"While I do not agree people will be deleting Twitter, I have seen the number of pickups on phones have dropped by over 90% a day since I stopped checking all day what Trump was tweeting about. If even a small percentage of the user base is also checking this much less, I can only presume forecasted projections will be dismal this next earnings call."
Another good day in the National Socialist Twitter Workers' Party.
Sell of this #$%$

"TWTR just suspended the account of a Republican congresswoman for expressing her opinion. TWTR claims her comments violated ""civic integrity"". TWTR is now actively banning speech by an array of conservative voices. Look for another selloff in the stock this week."
Just saw the video of Dorsey (On Tucker Carlson's video) stating he is planning to use Twitter to censor other people also!!! he is NOT American!!! scary!!!
"A wise person once said: If you are not an irrational liberal in your 20s you might not have a soft heart, but by the time you reach age 40 you are still a whimsical liberal and not a conservative, you might not have a functioning brain."

“Well done Jack! I could learn much from you.”

I will not use Twitter! American does not need Twitter anymore.Give us freedom!
When it goes to 50 cent Jack will give an executive order to reverse split this stock. That will get the price back up so he can continue his reign.

"Barney Rubble from the Flintstones with his Water Buffalo' Hat on with his American Flag and Spear, some call him King Neptune. That representation is not about what occurred on January 6th, that was just part of the piled on Circus side show's. The reasons why TWTR stock will plunge is also really separate from the events of January 6th. The reason why TWTR stock will fall, is about Social Media's actions relating to Freedom of Speech. You'd have to go back to Paul Revere and the Lanterns to understand that! TWTR has Violated the first Amendment and for that the Free World their is a price to pay. The U.S.A Citizens saw this type of control in China and Russia the suppression of free speech for years,. Our Free Capital Markets will surly send a message to not only TWTR, but to Facebbook, Google and others. In that group for many months to come will be product boycotts of advertisers as Products on those sights. There are 65 to 80 million Americans and maybe more who understand the Freedom of Speech and no change in administration is going to allow that to occur."

My parents tell her that she won't be able to purchase new cars like a Lexus if marxism being spewed by MSNBC, CNN, Huffington Post, NYT, Yahoo, Google, AOC, Bernie, Nancy, Schumer, and other leftists prevail. She told them that they don't know what they're talking about and have been watching too much Fox news. She proceeded to say all it takes is for the top 1% to pay their fair share and for corporations to give all of their earnings to their employees and the government. Unbelievable! MSNBC is all her and her husband watch 24/7."

What those two guys did was #$%$t factual objective information on the voting irregularities in Georgia and identified antifa members with photo's of them at antifa rallies and then they were wearing Trump gear and were in the front lines breaking into the capital building last week, photo's and streaming vid confirmed it. So for presenting the truth their accounts were suspended. Dump this #$%$ stock because the cash burn they are going to go through paying attorneys to defend them in 2021 is going to be significant. Oh yeah and they are a socialist run anti-free speech so called company as well."

My hearts are with you shareholders. You don't deserve what is about to happen to you investors. Twitter's censorship (communism) doesn't sit well with people in the free world. Twitter is gonna be gone so the sooner you bail the better off you'll be. Sorry but wake up.... stay free.
Bye twitter
Countries and states banning twitter
The new twitter is Yahoo finance forums.
"Welcome to Twitter! Uh... Yahoo! Finance Twitter public stock forum... where you can still share you opinions freely, and @Jack cannot do a dang thing about it. In fact, all those people he kicked off of Twitter platform are now coming here to air out their grievances. Personally speaking, I quit posting on Nov 3 and then deactivated a few days ago. Reason being... I don't participate on platforms that are corrupt and try to brazenly manipulate and subvert the minds of the masses. @Jack did it, and now he is paying the price. And I've heard the one thing they hate is to have someone like me or you share our opinion publicly when it makes them look bad. Oh, the irony!!!"

twitter will be less than myspace by the end of the year.
Had twitter not been buying its own shares it would have been worse. Institutional investors will start looking a exit points now. Get out.

It's up to you of course but when people are apologetic ONLY because they realize they are making money, and you as consumers go BACK to them, they still win.

I do think TWTR leaving the IRAN President's TWTR site active over the President of the Free World is a joke. It's why the Capital Markets will show TWTR what Freedom of Speech means in the U.S.A. Right or Wrong , Democrat or Republican Freedom of Speech will not be controlled by Social Networks in the U.S.A. Those who try to control it, well look at the close of trading on Friday for TWTR!"
Tucker is slicing and dicing them right now. Best get your shares out come morning. Lol
"I sold my shares and deleted my twitter account. I strongly oppose what the company is doing.However, the stock has significant upside based on valuation to peers and an incoming, friendly administration. Obama stated recently that big tech and government should work closely together. Philosophically, this is a disaster in my mind because I think we are an exceptional country based on our founding principles. If the new administration allows twitter and others to work around our rights when convenient, it will energize almost half the country. I believe TWTR could move to $100+ this year.

"For anyone who doesn't think trump is important to twitter. Look at the stock chart and compare it to when he took office in 2017. In 2016 is when he was campaigning seriously. Now having looked at the chart, #$%$ do you think is going to happen now that Trump is banned? Trump is most likely going to move to an alternate platform and there is going to be mass exodus from the site. Get out before you lose your money!"
I'm praying everybody buying puts and shorting this company makes enough money to donate to their local republican lawmaker. Remember guys to not only cancel any subscriptions you have but also deactivate your accounts so that they have a huge drop in users next quarter.

"There’s about to be some BIG CHANGES coming down the pike for not only Twitter but $FB as well. These online platforms, along with others, have PROFITED off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of MISINFORMATION among Americans that has caused HATE AND DIVISION within our country. They’re platforms are being used as tools to organize MASS RIOTS all over the US. I’ve been against FB and Twitter from the very beginning. It was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be SHUTDOWN. There is very little, if anything, “social” about them."

Thanks Parler people! Bought some twtr early today. Nice profit!! Keep up the good covering.

I think Twitter has made a big mistake. My opinion!
"Remember they push it higher on low volume so they can unload their positions at a good price. This will keep falling to reflect a price around 13 dollars. Write the following numbers down as you continue to short for a profit : Average Price: 47.8788 (50-day) 39.54 (200-day)Average Volume: 13,820,501 (50-day) 19,138,036 (200-day)"

A very large sign to a professional trader that a company is going down is that I’m able to flip it consistently for a profit. Also one must add the concept that many big tech are leaving California wit informed decisions while Dorsey conducts his business from a private island. The warning signs are all here for long term investors. Day traders like myself however are enjoying it very much. I highly recommend not investing in Twitter long term.
I wonder if snuckerburg loan twit bitter some cash from all the shares he has been selling. They are probably trying to stabilize the downward spiral.

$AAPL $TWTR $AMZN $FB. Look at the charts today. All artificially being pumped up. You’re going to get a few good days but it’s a slow and steady ride to the bottom. People are leaving their products and services because censorship isn’t good for anyone. Regardless of party.

"I shorted again this morning. Gotta remember, a 10% move in one day is generally a good time to take profits. However, there are exception. The air is coming out of Dorsey's balloon with predictable certainty! Also, I am a long in SRNE and INSM. Biotech is risky, but has tremendous upside! The institutions buy up biotech low, and then the standoff is for how many retail will sell their shares before the price explodes higher. In Twitter's case, the institutions were loaded up, and they're in a standoff for who blinks first. Meanwhile, retail has been exited on their intuition that this will not end well!"
"Twitter users on Thursday reported seeing their GameStop shares sold and their positions closed, with Robinhood justifying the sale due to “unreasonable risk.”"

"Twitter is simply destined to fail. There is no other way to see it. Whether it be by Dorsey’s own doing, the public protests that are inevitable worldwide, or the simple lack of public support through the course of the next four years. Any way I look at it, it is destined for failure. The most provocative instance is that there are 20-30 hungry better apps ready to take its place."

"So many people have left, Dorsey and Twitter is done. What a mistake!"
"Reminder $TWTR folks. Jack Dorsey owns SQ. He is also CEO at $SQ so he is mismanaging two companies by being politically extreme and alienating businesses owners from using SQ’s inferior product. How much is he truly focusing on one let alone two companies when he has been censoring mainstream America and giving a forum to rioters, looters, arsonists and their associated organizations.$PYPL and other alternatives are the way to go. Don’t be known as “doing a Dorsey”. Self inflicting financial harm to yourself and worse others who have no say and mistakenly invested in $SQ not knowing.Go check out the public records, the vast majority of Dorsey’s holdings are with $SQ He has very little left by comparison in $TWTR.Sell and save yourself the grief."
Tweet this Twitter stock going down fast here haha 
"Twitter will retrace, as its negative fundamentals remain: negative earnings, no dividend, loss of half its users, growth of competitors, and child sex abuse law suits."
Shorting Twitter is my new stimulus package!
"Question: are people going to continue to invest in massively inflated stocks like Twitter, or will money increasingly flow into precious metals, real estate, and solid stocks with substantial dividend yields? I believe bubble stocks like TWTR will burst in the near future."

"Since all other countries are completely banning TWTR, it still has long way to rank from here! What a guaranteed shorting win! "

On paper this stock should be worth zero. They have no viable product. Twitter is just an extension of the Democratic Party propaganda machine. Wake up people. Stock being propped up by desperate traders who are long o nthis dog.

Give Dorsey what he deserves by taking this stock under $10.
"While the right is suppose to set up shop at the capitals, I haven’t noticed governors calling their dogs off. All the while they’re planning through Twitter and fb to show up with a decent likelihood of violence. Both groups are equally freaked and the dems can’t figure that out. Nor will the media ask who they are."
why is this stock at a 50 billion market cap?Its worth less then the toilet paper in my bathroom. Is Manson still CEO?
Jack is buying his own stock. How can that last. Twitter will collapse. Down $5 today. Watch and see.

WOW ! Big accounts leaving Twitter. More people closing accounts ! Here comes the 30's folks. Twitter is losing billions of dollars everyday. And the CEO still thinks he did the right thing. What a DA !!!
"Last time Joseph mentioned his 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus monkey, the market dropped close to 200 points."
Hope you trumpers are sending him donations.... because I hear he's thinking of filing for bankruptcy for the 7th time
Big money bringing you in saying safe and cheap. Then the shorts will drop the hammer as institutional investors bail out. Be smart. Twit deleted millions of accounts. They will not come back. A generation gone. You think there is a future? It’s over. It will now be an echo chamber of movie stars doing selfies and politicians talking to nobody who believes them. The party is over and Jack doesn’t care about the investors only about his handlers. CHINA ￼￼

Bankruptcy is coming
Wow. Lin Wood on Parler views shows why Twitter is in trouble. The views are insane as his followers increase to over 1.1 million. Ashli is alive while Twitter and the other horrific Facebook went along to destroy our freedoms. 5.2 million views. https://parler.com/profile/linwood/posts

Big surprise tomorrow....the boat will sink deeper.
"I just got suspended by Youtube for expressing my opinions which someone flagged for review and didn't like. Have been with them for many years and nothing like this ever happened. Didn't post any outright ""hateful"" things just the truth in a polite manner. Maybe it's a good thing because I may have been spending too much time posting on their site. Have cancelled my Facebook account many years ago because I came to the conclusion that I don't need to ""friend"" people just for the sake of ""friending"" people. I like my privacy and have no desire to re-connect with people from my past and give day by day reports as to what I'm doing with my life. Was never on Twitter at all and have no intention to being on there."
Sell this commie company and any other company that does not support the 1st amendment.
"Let me be very clear here $TWTR didn’t make money before 80M users left the platform, because of censorship run wild. Upgrading the stock is radically irresponsible and should be investigated by the SEC immediately!"
"America is also freedom of choice. America you have a choice. I am a Finance guy, but have a minor in law. I was reading about legal challenges TWIT may face. It will be tough, they are a private company. Some one could challenge them and focus on their ""consistency of applying their own policies"". That may have a leg to stand on. Arbitrary deleting and suspending accounts?? If they did it to president because of violence threat OK although I may not agree OK. BUT, letting Iran keep up its post on killing americans (and yahoo police its a fact go look at it) is opening them up for legal challenges. The way to get back at TWIT is to delete your accounts. That's FREEDOM OF CHOICE. DONT USE THEIR SERVICE. That is the most powerful action Americans can take that don't agree. its very simple. Advertisers want return for their $$$. They will drop TWITTER or ask for reduced rates. Twitter earnings will suffer. Stock price will tank. Good luck"
Plausible deniability ...all the way down. - Red Jacko.
"SELL: Morgan Stanley, Vanguard, Northern Trust, Fidelity: ALL Big Twitter Investors. Close your brokerage accounts...move to Merrill or others who wouldn't touch this communist company..."
How many time has jack said “oh that was a mistake” when confronted in hearings about them silencing someone or something? I think it was at the least three times. I always thought it was three and out right?
Please some group or organization with the ability start a website listing all firms that advertise on FB and Twitter so believers in free speech can know whose products to boycott.
Any other stock with news of this magnitude would be all over the news. You try to find an article or discussion on any of these platforms about what’s going to happen to this stock tomorrow......it’s crickets.
TWTR's earnings report will be very misleading. The disaster that#$%$ this company did not start til after the end of the quarter - so the quarter that's about to be announced will not show the disaster ahead. Hopefully some longs and TWTR supporters will double up once earnings are announced and then get smoked when the next quarter's earnings are announced. Single digits are inevitable. You were warned - again.
that's alot of Twitter shares!
Divide and conquer the dems motto Freedom of speech is a right and should not be controlled by the left.Twitter has decided to divide and fuel the fire it will not end good for Twitter or it’s stock holders. Very bad decision on Twitters part.
I quit Twitter permanently after being on from the beginning. Parler is where I have gone.
Twitter is overrated as a communication platform
"I just deleted my Twitter account, because I don't support oppression"
Most people will cancel their twitter accounts as dem and repubs will fight for all of our free speech. The end of Twitter for sure
"Always respect risk! Institutions have a fiduciary responsibility to their share holders. They will not continue to hold a underperforming stock of a Co who has invited a possible RICO case,and multiple class action lawsuits in a market where so many other stocks are working. Too much opportunity cost! "
Twitter is the most damaging company to the humans in history. It’s basically controlled speech. It’s basically china.
the share price is now equal to the average I Q of a democrat
"Delete Twitter, FB, Amazon, Google and Apple account. SUPPORT Freedom Of Speech, your birth right."
Gab is up and running.
Shorts you can make history.
America 1st Twitter last! Protect your rights!
"I didn't even know what Parler was until a couple days ago, and shock to see the monopolistic big Tech TWTR, APPLE, AMAZON banded together to bully and shut down a small company. This is outrageous!"
Stomp Twitter stock into the ground!
"I think it only fitting and proper than the outgoing Commander-in-Chief and decorated veteran of the Bone Spurs Brigade should have a military send-off. Perhaps a reception line of Gold Star parents and a column of armor-plated Harley Davidson golf carts accompanied by a Company of the Proud Boys as well?Don't forget to mail your generous donation checks to David Dennison's newest Foundation. The one in New York was ordered closes a few years back, so don't bother.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Mulvaney and Giuliani AWOL"
Thank you Jack for bringing the haters out of the woodwork and saving me time in muting them.
"Cuckoo Dorsey has lowered the bar of what an American company is, and in doing so created the opportunity for a President that slashes 1,000,000 plus American jobs with his pen."
The EXODUS has only just begun.
"Many Americans, (silenced and intimidated by the left with their derogatory attack in conservatives), have been asking what they can do in these times to fight against the socialist agenda being pushed aggressively on our country...well, this is a start, dump this stock and all other big tech that’s trying to play god with our democracy...hit the radical elite where it hurts...their pockets $$$"
"Make Twitter a billion dollar company. Dump them and dump the stock. When they reach a billion like Parler, we will protest outside google and Apple until they take the app off their app stores."
"If MLK had a dream & he tweeted it, that too would be censored."
"For anybody that’s interested, I heard that the trumped store is having a BOGO sale. All payments are to be sent directly to Mar-a-Lago. Ironically, all purchases will be delivered via USPS."
so this chat is censored as well. my post was deleted. How sad. I did not post any lies or hate. just the reason why I deleted my Twitter account.
BLM protest
And Pennsylvania vote counters locked out GOP observers from their Philadelphia counting room for TWO DAYS.

The little blue bird is down substantially in after hours trading. This market closes at 8 pm. Better sell immediately before it drops even further. Tomorrow will be a brutal day for Big Tech companies like Twitter.
It takes a lot courage to hold TWTR thru the weekend.Best to get out before the closing bell.
Call your brokers first thing tomorrow morning to sell these toxic companies in your 401K and retirement portfolios!!
TWTR target 37.50 this week
Twitter has transformed social media to social nightmare under the disguise of free speech and ended with censorship of people and political views that lead to loss of trust to company and its leaders. It also damage its business and investors have lost their trust as well. Only institutions still holding Twitter shares right now will soon face the pressure from their clients and exit their positions in kitchen sink next few days or weeks.
Who has seen the whistleblower of Dorsey just released by Project Veritas? Thoughts?
Has the FBI deleted and bleached hunters. hard drive yet....
Bye Bye Twitter.

Like Ballots and Wells Fargo I expect millions of fake accounts to be set up

"The Truth. Once one person’s voice is taken away, even if you don’t agree with their speech, it is then only a matter of time until your voice is silenced as well."
“Can ya spare some change? I’ll even take a share of TWTR.”
Twitter banned the hashtag #1984 earlier this week. Oh the irony...
Isn't it about time for Tramp Stamp Brenda to show up and attempt to pump TWTR to over $50/shr?
Easiest money I've made in years. Keep shorting.

"It's Wednesday, January 13, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his brownshirt twatteratti be censoring today?"
HIGH VOLUME SELLOFF will continue. Twitter lost of millions of users permanently.
"Wow, down again! millions of accounts being cancelled by Freedom Loving Americans."
"To all twitter shareholders take a look at the comments, twitter is getting this strong of a reaction on Yahoo finance. Imagine what reaction they have to their twitter accounts. They are leaving by the millions and this still hasn't reflected that In it's share price"

"With all the legal beagles big tech has, you would have thought someone in the legal profession would have been aware of Military code 11.3.

"When you sell your stocks and don’t know which stocks to buy, may I recommend checking out GEVO, renewable energy company with 0 debt. Or check out oil companies, they are down they’ll double your money when it recovers I.E VET, OVV, CVE"

"The number of protesters who peacefully assembled on the mall in Washington, D. C. on January 6th is estimated to be 200,000. The number of citizens who entered the Capital building that afternoon is estimated to be 200. That means that only 1/10 of 1% of the protesters morphed into insurrectionists. The Left will try to link conservative patriots with those right-wing anarchists in an attempt to demonize and silence us. We must resist this false caricature in every legal way possible."
I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10 foot pole
"So when a company that has negative earnings creates a situation that produces negative growth and incites protests against the constitutional rights.... the buy point is what???? Out of business. Bankruptcy. I have cancelled my membership and sold all social media stocks I held.... some at a small loss, but much greater than zero. I also expect to see peaceful protests at these companies and the senior leadership soon"
"Support is about 45, take that out and there is no stopping this thing from utter collapse."

"I would like to see Twitter Fall dramatically. But, the money managers are not going to allow it to day. It is an expiration day for options; weekly options. I think Twitter will stay level. Because it is being Artificially been held up."
Don’t believe the slight bump. Being propped up. Won’t be here next year. Twitter is finito
"TWTR is down over $10 in the last 10 days, Awesome !!"

Let's see how many followers Sleepy Joe gets with his new Twatter account. LOL

"You know what's funny? Germany is hitting Twitter for its political censorship. Germany!!!! And France, and Mexico, etc, etc..."
I’m hearing they have had a ton of deactivations. They have also narrowed their sponsorship sources. Over the next couple of quarters I would like to see this back in the 20’s.
Twitter is in the lead at the race to zero. In second place we have facebook followed by Google Apple and Amazon. Its been some race today.

Changes in followers. @MikePence: -80k @Jim_Jordan: -160k @DailyCaller: -90k || @JoeBiden: + 1 million @KamalaHarris: +600k @AOC: +300k. Safe to say that many of those are new. I don't think $TWTR is losing a lot of users.
Short sell anyone?
Hope it drops to ZERO!

"The US is focusing on American politicians but the actions by TWTR et al have an international blowback. Basically, people like German Chancellor Merkel have openly stated disagreement with TWTR and others because they see that they could be silenced. But, those countries will shut them down first. Not good for the shareholder value. Too much downside risk."
OMG ... 'TrumpTV' will be Armageddon for Jackoff's little Twitter.
How’s Uganda’s doing ?

"TWTR has the support of the Hollywood elite which don’t even know how much a box of cereal costs and certainly do not understand the market. They will pull support on a whim, no solid investors support this stock currently imo."
Social media argues that they should not be held legally responsible for content as they are just a platform and cannot control it. Apparently they can. There goes that arguement.
"Reposting For The Second Time Since Someone Enjoys Deleting My Post;) When I First Started Trading Stock I Bought SBUX! Since I Owned The Stock I Tried It Out!

Of Course This Was A Huge Mistake That I Deeply Regret! Thank Goodness, I Didn’t Short SBUX! Oh My! That Would Have Been a Bigger Mistake! My Point is Just Because You Do Not Like a Company For Some Particular Reason! Doesn’t Mean The Company Will Not Continue On And Make Money and Grow in Share Price! Our Beautiful Blue Bird is Known Around The World! I Believe She Will Make Our World a Better Place To Live! She Is One Strong Red Hot Chick;)"
Why hasn’t Jack Dorsey been arrested for lying under oath about Twitter’s censorship policies?
The smart ones have sold already. The real decline will occur once TWTR is forced to publish the reduced subscribership statistics. That will be a beautiful event.
Just deactivated my account. It was simple and I’m so happy!
getting ripped on fbn right now. Cancel culture economics. Only targeting conservative. Price target $0.0
Boeing crashed another plane. Their stock won’t perform as bad as Twitter tomorrow.

QUESTION: Should we establish a GoFundMe account to help Parler to purchase their own servers to get back to business?
"MOST people on the right who are #$%$ off with Twitter haven't left yet as they don't want to be disconnected entire. Most people on the left will ALSO exit as they don't have Trump to hate on every day anymore. It's already boring and will only be more boring as Biden will suddenly have to actually LEAD instead of blaming every paper cut or stubbed toe on Trump. So once everything is resolved in DC the current exodus will like a slow drip compared to the tsunami who will drop twitter in 2-3 months. Not to mention those who ONCE KNEW letting everyone speak their mind, even when you vehemently disagree with them, IS an American value, they TOO will exit twitter for taking such a dictatorial heavy hand. And once they go, they will NEVER come back. Check out Fox News, NFL, NBA, if you do not believe losing your audience in THIS manner, is PERMANENT. Twitter will NEVER have MANY of these users ever again. There is also a coming Facebook exodus...it will be very strong as well. Feb-March timeframe enjoy the downward slides shorting these stocks."
cancel culture stocks in trouble tomorrow
"I had a Twitter account way back at the start, but never used it. I wonder if I can still access it because I want to delete it on principal. Once I save some stuff off FB that will be history too."

The Day Traders must be mad trading this. Watch them ditch this though before market closes. NO one in their right mind wants to be holding this until Tuesday.
"7+ years since going public. Still in same position.Current analysts targets below the present share price.And shareholders tolerate a part time destructive CEO, that has cashed out the majority of his holdings long ago.His wealth is tied up in his full time CEO duties with $SQ Square seems to be doing quite well where Jack Dorsey’s wealth is and TWTR shareholders continue to get bent over.Take your frustrations out on SQ. Hit deranged Jack where it hurts."
Next stop will be $35-$40...good luck who ever holding it.
"It's less about Jack banning the President and more that he is able to ban whoever hurts his feelings. If TWTR is able to censor the New York Post for an accurate story without doing any research or validation, they can do this to anyone. It sets a precedent that can be used against those who now support it. Remember the Reid Rule??"

"Voltaire said, “I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”"

The left broke the backbone of America. Can we count on them to defend us if our country gets invaded? Maybe they’ll tweet for help but who’s there to listen?
Keep your eyes open for institutions to start selling
"The same reason these tech companies have section 230 they used their power to shut down opposition and censor even the POTUS. Are you serious? We have a Constitution, and can't wait to see the results of all this. I promise todays valuations of these Big Tech will lose BIG. They have gotten too big for their own good."
Time to get rid of all the big tech companies apps They are linked to government mass surveillance
"Yahoo FB TWIT AMZN are all censoring us. Don’t think of it as a right or left issue, think of it as we’re losing our rights issue"
Wish this was open today so it could tank again.. Communist company...MAGA FOR LIFE !
"The Big Lie is that Slow Joe won the election. The whole world knows he didn't. Sad, the only way the Socialists can win is to cheat."
Twitter started the run too late and chose the wrong time. Hence the shareholder lawsuit to silence him. The purchase of the recent company was a reach to a peg of a drowning company and they overpaid extremely because it was from desperation.
Sell this stock. Protect Freedom
This is SO MUCH fun. You just KNOW there will be hard data soon about how many MILLIONS of users Jackoff has lost for Twitter! Look out below....!!!
Twitter is done for. I’m out.
Shorts exercise your free speech United we all stand . Freedom of speech
Next step is to contact the top advertisers for twitter and let them know you will not purchase their products if they continue advertising on Twitter . nestle is their biggest advertiser - so let go citizens
Continue to short this stock close all long positions.
picking up a short position at 48... thanks twitter!
sleepy joe is gonna crush major projects and hurt the economy. get ready for a good 2 month lockdown in USA. you'll be begging for Donald to come back.
Unsuspecting Americans are being forced to invest in this commie company as the company is in the S & P 500. Get your 401k out of that fund and any other fund that doesn't have twtr or other commie companies.
This stock will get blackballed by the investor community.

"I cancelled my $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts."
"I think TWTR is going to be hit the worst from deactivations, more so than FB and AMZN. Nothing of personal significance is lost by deactivating TWTR; FB is most likely where families and friends stay in touch, and AMZN is AMZN (though I've long started to diversify my online purchases, anyway). I think FB could see more Instagram account cancellation."
Nobody needs Twatter
A good time to pick up some short positions at opening
Users leaving TWTR is only just beginning. Millions have left already - but that's just the beginning. Not many advertisers will want to waste money on this sinking ship. Those that do will only do so because the decision makers for those companies are as far left wing as Dorsey. Wasting company money to advertise just to support someone else's political stance will not sit too well with those companies and heads will roll. This ship is sinking - and it's not alone.
"Today free speech is under assault , has anyone listened to rap music recently....Talk about hate speech..."

"They’re coming to take you away Haha!A heavy-metal guitarist, the alleged leader of a Colorado paramilitary training group and two ex-military militia members from Ohio have been charged with allegedly taking part in the riot at the Capitol last week, as the FBI ratchets up its investigation into the role extremist groups played in storming the building."
"Who remembers ""NOT MY PRESIDENT""?"
This is going to get bad. TWTR is going to suffer. Should we sell before the dump really takes place?Any thoughts?
I bought and used all my savings on puts to reward myself. I believe in liberties. say no communism
“Nice work Jack! Welcome to the club!
I wish I had a twitter account to delete but I have never had one.
This stock is way overpriced. It's negative earnings speak volumes.
"According to Fox Business the cost of property damage from riots across the nation this summer will exceed 1 billion dollars.Axios states it will be between 1 and 2 billion dollars.The property damage done on Jan. 7th in Washington, D.C. will be much, much smaller.We should send the bill for the summer rioting to the DNC."
"There will be a massive offloading of Twitter shares today. The fall in share price will be faster than we've seen all week. Project Veritas has spilled the beans on Dorsey, and you can bet the institutions want out asap, while they can still save some of their investment. Get out people. It's going to hurt anyone caught up in this. If they won't buy your limit, make it a market sell, because that's probably how fast this is going to drop. When that happens the little man has no chance unless he gets out at market price."
Twitter wanted Parler shut down because people were leaving witter by the millions. Not a sustainable model. Now they have angered half of America. Their business model is too easy to copy.

"Just pulled this from an article published today from Tipbanks:Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz believes that the ban could pose significant hurdles to the company’s 2021 mDAUs (monetizable daily active users) and ad revenue “on top of already tough COVID user compares,” which he estimates added about 3 million and 15 million incremental US and outside US mDAUs (estimated), respectively, last year.Zgutowicz further stated that his scenario analyses indicated that the ban could wipe off 6 million-9 million US mDAUs this year. The analyst argued that the move, along with tough COVID-induced user growth comparables, leave the company a “little room to deliver positive ’21 results.” The analyst reiterated a Hold rating on Twitter and lowered his price target slightly to $39 from $40."

"Does anyone know how to join the coming class action lawsuits against TWTR? Every lawyer in America must be frothing at the mouth ready to file class actions and anti trust lawsuits against APPL, TWTR, AMXN, and GOOG right now. The Board of Directors need to step in and take action on behalf of the shareholders being bent over becasue of management's actions. AMZN has clearly demonstrated they are a monopoly or belong to a group of monopolies in the cloud & infrastructure hosting arena. Not to mention, they are definitely in breach of contract with Parler. There is no way IN HELL AMZN will be able to justify breaking their Parler contract without allowing Parler to first offload to another provider. Can you imagine the lawsuit coming AMXN's way on this? And for what? Just to pound their liberal drum a little louder?"

"haven't used Twitter or facebook for a about a year now and I don't miss one bit. I never had an issue with any of the platforms, I just found myself living through them more and more and had to make a change. One of the best decisions i could've ever made. My life and overall mindset has improved greatly over the last year. I still have many open accounts that I am deleting today. I hope this catches on and sticks because I really do feel that it is for the better of every single individual person. Go out and talk face to face with people, so that you can develope real relationships with real emotions. It is natural and healthy."

"what happen if 50 millions account users turn into a class action lawsuit? that will be huge and ... possible these days. I don't own any of TWTR stock and not a fan of Trump but a private company should do business only. If they don't like what Trump does then they need to seek some kind of authority (somewhere and somehow, like Nacny, she is hungry of power, will give a bless if TWTR asks for one!). Why you mess your business with politics. What happen next will be lawsuit dismiss liability protection from social networking company. that will be a big loss for FB and TWTR. Google and Apple will be next too."

Hey Jack...
"I just read that the NY Post has instructed it's journalists to not use CNN, MSNBC, WaPro and NYT as primary sources. This is very good. I think there will be more to follow their lead. Basically, the NY Post is censoring CNN, ,MSNBC, etc. as primary sources. YES!!!!!"

The Exodus of big Tech. GAB is running slow because of a million new users a day. Telegram just broke 500 million users. IF conservatives can't win a rigged Election they can win through power of the purse and choosing platforms who believe in free speech

Twitter must release an 8K disclosing the cancellations.
"The current Bull Market began in March of 2009. It is nearly 12 years old, the longest in history.History tells us that stock valuations do not go up indefinitely. I believe Biden's economic policies will usher in a new Bear Market- just look at what he has already done to the energy sector."
Dorsey on the Veritas recording with the face of the Marxist saying it's time to take the opposition down....and guess what? The vote is with him as the stock opened up. Guess there are more people who hate the Constitution and We the People than I thought.
"Every time I post a comment about how the Democrats will ruin the economy, stock market, and country it will get deleted, if people on here who are censoring these comments disagree with that and think things will be just fine 2, 3, or 4 years from now why would they sensor a #$%$ statement then......I will tell you, because they know it is true and that many people who voted against Trump will look back 3 or 4 years from now and wish they had voted for him and just kept silent about it!"
"The stock opened at 52.31 last Friday. When it opens tomorrow it will be somewhere around 45. That's a loss of around 15% in one week. When will shareholders demand Jack's removal as CEO? Which activist investor wants to buy these shares and a massive discount, oust Jack, and see the shares go to 80?"
Material Event has happened. Twitter could be a in violation of SEC laws unless it files an 8K detailing massive USER loss.
DownDownDownDownDown it goes Where it stopsNobody knows
"Look at what Germany, India, England, Mexico are saying about twitter. Twitter is on a downward spiral because Jack Dorsey runs his companies based on Ideology not principles. The Securities and Exchange Commission should come down on him for defrauding investors."

Don’t forget the 10% for the big guy.
When Twitter locks you out they don't allow you to deactivate your account. This artificially inflates the actual number of user count so as not to alarm advertisers and affect the Twitter stock price. NOT WORKING!
USA!USA!
"Price target is $39 (much lower in my opinion) from analyst's, why would anyone buy this at $44.50"
I will do everything in my power this year to get my friends to move to another conservative alternative from Twitter and FB. Their censorship is outrageous.
Many upgrades for Twitter at $65 dollars target price and TD keeps reaffirming to hold this stock. I will be a believe only if this stock reaches $60 first.
"BLM/Antifa did it. They even filmed Ashley Babbitt being shot, after they egged her on. This is so incredible it is shocking."

On fox Twitter down big on dropping potus from platform. This is going down big on Monday.
This stock has zero retail support and is being held up completely by hedge funds using their wealthy clients money.
censoring and deleting is also called tampering with evidence
Muting an American for speaking in a “free country” where you’re able to say whatever you want because you are allowed to. This country is really starting to become an absolute joke. Free speech is no longer allowed in America and companies like Twitter are really throwing wood on the fire here

"I’ve done tech longer than bat kid has demanded attention. Nobody measures accounts. Nobody counts accounts. Hotmail doesn’t count how many registered of half registered or verified or unverified accounts it has and Microsoft doesn’t report that number. The numbers they do care about are Activity, page views, retweets, ad views, ad clicks. And looking at the group on 1/6? Not only are they freeloaders, they never click on Twitter ads, and never buy anything advertised. That’s why it’s 0 value keeping them and their impressions and their risky activities. Getting a sweet jasmine or mypillowbiter ad over at defunct GRUparler wasn’t so special."
"I predict this. Twitter will continue to fall. Next month they'll have fallen so much they'll do a reverse split. Then slowly sink from there into bankruptcy. Twitter is finished. Half the users are gone, the advertisers won't like that. Revenues will plummet."
I would expect a 12% drop by this Friday.
This #$%$ banned the president but gives khumeini a platform...Hope it hits $8 by the end of the week
Keep pounding this puppy down day after day.... Censoring/banning has consequences Jack... Get it ???

The Industrial Revolution happened with almost play by play mirror image as this big tech revolution is happening. In the history of the industrial revolution 100% of the leaders of that circumstance are now considered evil men. Supporters of Twitter are very short sighted.
Twitter’s future is not looking too bright. The creepy CEO has moved onto other business ventures—Investors should too.
Censoring half the country doesn't seen like a good business move
This is Great! Jack Dorksey needs to have an awakening. Ever here of the postal service banning you frommailing a letter??And let’s not forget Radio! It’s still there and it’s free! have one in my garage.. no data plan required.
Who remembers MySpace? What about Friendster? Twitter has passed its apogee and there is no turning back.
Why would anybody buy a company that increase 2-10% over a year and no dividends but donate the shareholders dividends to leftist group. There are millions of companies that values increase 10-20% in a day.
Couldn't happen to a nicer company unless it was Facebook (D.A.R.P.A) or Google (C.I.A)
Twitter shorts are crying
"NASDAQ Futures and pre-market Twitter stock price are both down significantly. This portends a big drop in Twitter today, and maybe the beginning of a major downward price movement."
"I recommend selling this stock short. Since they do not believe in freedom of speech for conservatives,they are doomed to go out of business."
Twitter becomes an empty echo chamber liberals talking to liberals; I’m gone having left FB years ago.
"sell, sell, sell............................"
I am out folks. Liquidated my Twitter long position. Any tine a company begins to Qualify their customer base it is never optimal for the bottom line. As a wise man once said to me: If you are all in agreement with me I do not need all of you! Long live Freedom of Speech!
Some institutions already hedged there bet with short positions
Twatter is providing the model for all brownshirt wannabe organizations. Jack Dorsey has enlisted in Goebbels's army.
Last one out shut the lights

I have stopped using amazon and have switched to ebay and overstock
Ten more upgrades and this will be at 37 in a few weeks...
I say the company sells all the assets and goes out of business and redistributes all proceeds to the American people.
Now even more glad I sold my $TWTR end of Dec for some great gains as looks like it's going to be cyptonite to own it going forward. Going to now look at unloading my $FB as well. #timber
Twitter appoints first male CEO after Dorksey resigns!
Josh Hawley is one of my HEROES.....
An article from Seeking Alpha from 2 days ago said that at the end of Q3 TWTR had 187M users. Wanted to share this number because it will give us a baseline to see what percentage of the people delete their accounts.
Sold my shares and deleted my account. I'm staying away from this mess of a company. Look at that 5 day chart!
"Well I don't live in the US and I don't really have a preference for Democrat or Republican leadership as an investor both of them have their good and bad sides. How ever as far as twitter goes, you have to wonder which opinions will be deemed unacceptable next and will start facing censorship."
Not impressed by Twitter’s CEO trying to answer questions from Cruz.
Hope you sold when you had a chance. This thing will be negative by days end.
30% of all Dems thought the election was stolen. Google it. What does that tell you.
I deactivated my twitter account today.
I sold my last share and gout out with a $18 profit. Haha. TWTR will start to drop when their earnings report comes out. This is not an investment but rather a black hole.

Who is staring down the TWTR shorts today?
"Have you had enough yet? No coincidence it underperformed the market again. The company destroyed itself, with no regard for the shareholders, just the selfishness and loathing driven by Jack Dorsey part time CEO, has no significant financial stake in this either.What does he care?But he does care about $SQ where he has his wealth and is also CEO.Maybe SQ should be treated the way Dorsey treated TWTR shareholders, which was with no regard."

"Twitter is not aging like fine wine, more like a manufactured home on the ledge of an eroding cliff side! Buy at your own peril. Please don’t fall for the PM games, this weekend was another wasteland over at Twitter as millions abandon ship, and give Jack the ole sayonara..."
Stop the steal
I really think Jack Goebbels Dorsey is getting tired of Twatter. You can tell the distractions it's causing him from keeping focused on grooming his beard and nose rings. I look for him to end up selling Twatter for anyone who takes it once it dives to the $5-$10/share region.
Sold all my twitter stock on Thursday. Selling apple on Monday.
if twitter wasnt actually worried about other platforms like parler and Gab then it wouldnt be working so hard to take down parler etc. The fact is theyre very worried and their next earnings will show that. Numbers wont lie.
market cap will be under $1 Billion before year end
Small fortune loss in the last two days.....big tech. will not beat Trump....I am just sad that innocent shareholders became cannon fodder in Jack Dorsey's losing war.......MAGA FOREVER
Twitter = Censorship
I am going to sell all of my TWTR.... they don't represent the type of company I want to be involved with anymore.
"One of these days a big business CEO is going to realize that their company should be indifferent to all things political and focus on delivering to their customers the best product at affordable prices. A business should be non political, and CEO's should keep their political views private."
Sad day in America when the liberal/socialist big tech media companies shut down free speech! And at the same time limit any other social media company/s (like Parlor) with the ability to compete in the market! Now we as Americans get to see what it's like in other socialist countries. And the saddest thing is how young Americans think socialism is OK. That's what you get when the majority of liberal /socialist teachers and professors are brainwashing them in the schools.
Nobody is interested in state run media
It just keeps falling!! This fantastic!! I cannot wait until it falls below the $40 mark!! Could not have happened to a nicer group of people.
The deep state is full of shallow thinkers and they own TWTR. Sweet dreams.
down 20% already !! let’s make it 50%!!! take Dorsey on a reality check!
Trump today will go after Twitter. Watch the stock collapse.
"Give it 5 years and TWTR will be under $ 5.00 a share , Conservatives will go elsewhere and liberals just want their opinions only ."
Twitter is going down quick... Big tech has gotten too big
Will Rudy Giuliani defend Garret Miller and Enrique Torres? Will Mexico pay the legal fees? Stay bigly tuned.
$52 billion combined losses for twtr and FB since banning President Trump
The best way to “teach” a company is through consumer and shareholder’s decisions. Twitter is learning the lesson.
"Bottom line the user retention rate and new user rates will be down dramatically. The less eyes on the platform the less ad revenue. There is a direct correlation. A Self inflicted wound. As large institutional holders continue too unwind their positions heading into earnings, law firms are putting together their class action lawsuits. The gap down on earnings during the after hours will likely be dramatic. Hilarity will ensue "
Delisted 2021!!!!
When the big guy spends a trillion dollars paying off everyones student debt I have 2 questions...#1 where does the money go ...#2 where does the money come from......

Newsom Lifts Strict Stay-at-Home Order From All CA Regions Even Though Covid Cases Are Higher Than When Order Started in December
Lesson for Twitter here: Companies should not get involved in politics or religion. I thought that was Business 101!
"Goodbye Twitter, taking my profits and never looking back. You censor our freedoms you lose my business. It disgusts me when billionaire Marxist remove our voice. SELL,SELL,SELL"
"By March TWTR will be below $20.. DAU, MAU went bye, bye! TWTR ban Australia, Poland, Hungry, S.Korea, Japan, Philippines, India, Germany, France.. coming.. Uganda already bans TWTR!"
Let those who support censorship support this stock. As for me --- I'm outta here.
Twitter about to join MySpace
I personally don't care to take sides on the election or any other topic folks are going on about. But when a company takes away the freedom of speech ALL Americans are affected. What they did is basically Communistic censorship. It cannot be tolerated by any American as we ALL will suffer. These are difficult times that I hope we get through quickly but Twitter has done nothing but divide us further. I have cancelled by account and I truly hope they fail. This cannot be tolerated at any level.
This what the market thinks of the Retrumplicans thinking they could sink Twtr pps....
Twitter just created a new cencorship tool for all of its leftist users to silence conservatives...as if you needed any more reason to delete you account.
Removed twitter and Facebook from my phone. Already happier.
Easiest short this year. Losing accounts caused by jack’s censorship. Love watching this crash to 20 or below.
"Since Facebook and Twitter want to cut off any other competition to their monopoly and censorship of media, I say dump them both and just call and talk to someone on your phone. Yea, it's old fashion but you actually get to hear the other person and they get to hear your voice. This censorship thing has gone too far. Last I looked this was still America. At this rate we won't have to worry about China or Russia for interference for meddling in our lives!"
"This will be like AOL and Netscape... Get out while you can. To my conservative allies, we don’t need to do everything at once. If we show one tech company at a time - this time, Twitter - and create our own platforms, counterparts to the other mainstream platforms will come about. A multi-millionaire or billionaire would be silly not to cater to conservative minded people for those platforms. They’d literally make a BOAT load. Will it take a while...? Sure, but, as with the story with the tortoise and the hare, we learn that slow and steady wins the race..."
"Twitter, look at the price of this stock and they do nothing. You could buy more than half the stocks on the Dow for less than this. You could also buy a real stock like Coca Cola. What is it Twitter do again? Oh right they advertise stuff, and sell their users information to third-parties. That's their entire business model..."
Never ever invest or use services of politically biased company. Anything you post on left wing social media they don't like will come back to haunt you.
"SUPPORT Freedom Of Speech, your birth-right that the Founding Fathers ensured for you.Delete Twitter, FB, Amazon, Google and Apple accounts."

Never posted before on finance but Twitter has bitten the hand.... unreal
"According to CNBC, 50 LEOs were injured and 2 killed on Jan 7th. Tragic and disgusting.According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association more than 2,000 LEOs were injured during the summer riots.Were is the outrage from the Left about these sad facts?"
For Basic Human Rights and Dignity! Sell Twitter!
10 dollars a share will be here shortly.
keep the pressure on. they can't prop it up forever. It will collapse.
Another red day for Twitter! Straight men’s reaction everywhere.
I am selling all my Twitter and Facebook stock. I have made a lot of money but they will soon fail.
It won't be long before old man Joe cuts off all aid to Israel...Joe announced that the borders are now wide open and people from countries that hate us are now welcomed to come here.Just in time for the stimulus check.....
"I deleted Facebook and Twitter from my cell phone. Now, my battery life is over 2 days. I am so glad I deleted them. Twitter will sink like a lead balloon. Nobody likes being censored."
"If we (Americans) don’t stop division within, we will follow the footsteps of the Roman Empire. Great book: The History of the Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire was written by English historian Edward Gibbon. At least we can learn what comes next."
"All in all, not a bad day. BECAUSE I SHORTED TWTR early this morning... The one thing Jack and his type cannot handle is getting embarrassed on public forums. You know he must be on the phone with Yahoo right now trying to shut us down! But it's not happening, lol!"
Just cancelled twitter. I see lots of competition coming in and regulations will begin when they see all the conservatives moving to a new platform. I think I’m gonna sell short
"Never went on Twitter and I'll probably be deleting my Facebook too. Be careful what you wish for Lefties, because it could be YOU who is censored one day. Society's new mantra is - shutup and take it and do what you are told. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is dead.Is it not curious that all the big names are dropping Parler in lockstep? Eliminate your competition when you see blood in the water. There's no reason Parler should be shutdown.Whether you know it or not, you are being controlled in order to make rich people richer. Guess who's getting richer during the COVID pandemic? It ain't the average American. It's big corporations, 1%ers, and the D.C. power circle. Draconian restrictions and lockdowns has caused more harm around the world than the virus itself. China. Guess who else has ties with China? Your new President."
Be prepared if you own Twitter time to get out. Internet providers are canceling Twitter on there platforms!!Stock is going to drop like a rock!! by June I estimate it will be at 10 bucks!!
Don’t forget to give them a 1 star rating on App Store when you close your Twitter account.
Comrad Stalin would have loved Twitter
broke down hard today. Any news?
"It could certainly happen today, but I think the chances are it will happen later this week. I'm talking about the bottom falling out of this. A quick drop under 44 and this stock is ready to drop a LOT of money..."
Deactivated my account and deleted the app.
"watch tomorrow ,TWTR going south ."
One of the largest management decision blunders of all time. May their plummet continue ....
Who needs Twitter or Facebook ?Trust me parlor will be back up and running
If you are still using Twitter you are now at extreme risk of being targeted by cyber criminal attacks!
Which side would Twitter have chosen in the industrial revolution? That matters very much.
Comrade Xi approves Jacks censorship.
thanks for the gains

"To the powers that be, @jack the CEO of twitter is purposely throwing away customers. His first obligation, as the CEO of a public company, is to the shareholders. Last time I checked, throwing away customers is not revenue producing.The Board of Directors of Twitter should fire @jack because he has lost his mind."

why buy communist companies

"Twitter's largest advertiser is Nestle. Just sent them the following message: ""If you choose to continue advertising on Twitter, the brazen enemy of free speech, I will choose to purchase products solely from your cpmpetitors."""
Good opportunity for insiders to line up for the exits!
"In all the years I have been investing, I have never shorted any stock. But I may want to very soon. Im thinking Twitter and Facebook are both losing subscribers now. And when Parler comes back on line at the end of the month, many more subscribers are likely going to leave those two jokes of ""social platforms""..."
Buy more Twitter￼ shares? Yes! Only to Short. It’s the beginning of the end for Twitter here is Twitter stock in 2021￼
"Australia, UK and now India may ban Twitter, Google, and Facebook for censorship"
"As some point, we all need to realize that as a country we are better than what Twitter is representing. There are many great companies to trade and make nice money on like the EV stocks.

"The countdown has started for the House to be taken from the dems, just like in 2010."
Glad I don’t use Twitter anymore.
The comments here are brutal...LOVE IT!
"Twitter's whole business is about selling YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION to third parties. They likely make $$$$'s per user selling your information to anyone who will pay for it, and that includes BAD ACTORS in foreign countries who WILL STEAL that information. You are a commodity to Twitter. It's a meat market, and they are selling us all. FACEBOOK is doing the same thing. Twitter even estimate what you are worth. This is incredible but true, look it up."
CrazyI dropped FB and Twitter and I find myself doing more productive things! Sad how addictive I was to them!
"Delete tweeter and Facebook account, boycott apple phone"
This is what happens when you condone this censorship based solely on your own beliefs. You can’t silence everyone you don’t agree with and think you won’t get backlash. R.I.P. Twitter. Dorsey already looks like a homeless person. I can’t imagine what this will do to him.
Hannity just told everyone to leave twitter and go to Parler on his show
when the media said the hospitals were full in the key hotspots during the peaks they were basically EMPTY as conformed by citizens. Greatest FRAUD in history
Short since 52.50 and still holding
Twatter had this coming for months. Sure glad Dorkey stepped up his game the last few weeks by taking his mask off to reveal the CCP-sponsored censorship. Making money is too easy on the backs of these Demonrat sympathizers.
"Sell sell sell, FCC is going to remove this stock soon, too many lawsuits"
Walking corpse in charge till 2024. Not good. TWTR about to get a $10 haircut this year
"Telegram surpassed 500 million active users in January, according to a statement from Pavel Durov, the messaging app’s founder. Durov noted that 25 million people downloaded the platform in just 72 hours. In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA.This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We’ve had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different.People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users."
get fid of Robin hood and get a legit broker
Twitter lost its status.. Better invest in Toyota.
Wait until the Reddit crew gets here. The cult will burn like fat on the barbie.
Maybe I will sue Dorset to recover the ads I paid before on Twatter. I couldn't not believe I gave money to this muffin liberal then he gave away 10 million dollars to the BLM.

Maricopa County Board of Supervisors claimed they picked Pro V&V and SLI Compliance because these two auditors were certified by the EAC. They chose these entities in spite of the offer by election ballot expert Jovan Pulitzer who has a method to review every single ballot in the county to determine the true and accurate validity of the votes. Pulitzer explained the various obstacles the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors have created to prevent a solid audit in the county
"should i wait until $25 to sell, or should i sell now?"
"Twitter has entered into a binding agreement to settle the shareholder derivative lawsuits that accused CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives of misleading shareholders about Twitter’s growth, while selling their own personal stock.The lawsuits were first filed in October 2019 by shareholder Jack Porter, and accused Dorsey and his colleagues of misrepresenting the growth of Twitter’s (TWTR) user base and artificially inflating the share price.Porter accused the defendants of exploiting their positions and selling “their personal stock holdings for hundreds of millions of dollars in insider profits” while possessing material, non-public information.The proposed settlement absolves Dorsey and his co-accused of any wrongdoing without any liability attributed to them or the company.As part of the agreement, Twitter will implement certain corporate governance adjustments and will pay for certain administrative costs. The company will not be required to make any additional payments.In addition, under the terms of the settlement, Twitter’s insurers will pay $38 million to the company that will be used for general corporate purposes. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion initiated a Hold rating on TWTR last week and set his price target at $45. This implies downside potential of around 6% from current levels."
There are better places to make money
"One thing is for sure, every country will have competing social apps for the current apps. This is an opportunity for the entrepreneurs. Social apps will now be seen as risks that you need to diversify. We have many banks, we'll have many apps. I am guessing there will be apps based on ideology, home country vs international, etc"
I canceled Twitter. Too risky to continue. Haters will manipulate this stock. Not worth it! Bye bye
Why does Twitter continue to allow hate speech and violence directed at conservatives on their platforms ? This is an evil company!
Freedom of speech for all. America.. Not Twitter.
Recovering on diminished volume; going significantly down on increased volume before the close.
i dont have any twtr shares or account but i will love to see this baby goes down-6% every day will be niceif you want censorship go to China
maga won. god bless America
Should be a class action lawsuits against the CEOs and a DOJ investigation into collusion. A warrant should go out now for all of their emails and phone calls

"Twitter is going to fail, and here's why. What to watch now is how the so-called Tech Giants go to war with one another. Truth is they hate each other and want a slice of the same pie. Social media is a small part of it to Google and Amazon, they are competing for the Cloud market and the AI which is being rolled out to replace your jobs. I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI, and the plain truth is, that's what Covid is really about. It's blown out of proportion to lay off millions and replace them with IBM Watson and other products. Banks and other are already rolling it out. Meanwhile the battle rages betweem Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud. The war they are fighting between themselves keeps them divided (for now). Twitter is really just a fly on the wall to that lot, and they won't save Twitter."
nothing said or done about BLM riots that's ok speech- well it's ok then to cancel TWTR accounts too--cancel culture is going to find out canceling can go both ways
Looking for a 30% to 50% haircut of this overpriced deep state media platform as 70% of accounts are closed immediately.

This will break 40 by Friday and head into the 30's

yahoo is censoring my comments
"I'm calling hogwash on Jack Dorsey's statements this morning. He is pulling the wool over the eyes of his willing accomplices in the media, investment houses and political realm, but not on those of us that have seen the light! Okay, here's the problem. He's making a killing over at Square, because he had the foresight to get invested bigly in Bitcoin! That's keeping him afloat for now. And making me second guess my short position, for now! I may just hold it and add to it if the price rises 10-20% on the claims that censoring free speech and millions of conservatives leaving his platform don't matter to the bottom line. If you believe that, I have 20,000 bitcoin to sell you at 40k!"
I’m getting rock hard just thinking about this stock going down and down. Dorsey is a poor excuse for a man.
Dorsey uses Twitter to play god and not make money. Square is for money and Twitter is for feeling powerful. Get it yet?
A law must be coming. Censoring communication cannot be condoned in the U.S.
"The left wingers seem to enjoy knocking on the doors of conservatives and interrupting their private lives with ""peaceful"" protests. Why does the right not reciprocate against the likes of Dorsey, Stacey Abrams, AOC, the entire squad, etc? Both sides are entitled to peaceful protests, right?"
Forgot to mention that Kamala Harris also supported anarchists charged with physically assaulting and causing bodily harm to law enforcement officers. She is worthy of impeachment. Please do your part to make this a reality by conducting your House Representative. Thank you !
"in the 30's next week, way to go jack !!!!"
Propaganda news! Twitter and all the media! China run
All you can do with a company this badly run is SHORT IT. I'm shorting it. I expect it to be trading on the otc market in 6 months for 30c or less.
it is not like twitter has any real assets. It is valued on the number of users and how long they stay on the platform. Other countries besides ours are waking up to the threat of big tech. It is just not the U.S. anymore.
Why would anyone in his right mind own this stock??? #sellstock
4 hours until the pre-market opens and the bloodbath begins for Twitter.
Sell before it’s too late!
Twitter saw its market cap plunge by $3.5 billion.way to go jack!
Think about it. You eliminate 50% of your business an your stock goes up. Could it be those who know are bailing while propping up their stock prices?
"Folks, Twitter has carpet bombed their platform. Literally a train wreck over there! Here's a first hand account from a Twitter orphan (I deactivated my acct): ""I'm still on there.

we don't have to go to the Capital building to let everyone know how we feel about what's going on we can handle it here
"Further thoughts on the upgrade... today is the day that margin calls would be completed. If someone had a large Twitter position and needed to dump it, issuing the upgrade today would make lots of sense... Down from here."

There is special place in pink sheets for TWTR.
Sell Twitter Get out freedom back
Short this dog. Something is wrong about today.
George Soro is the only one trying to prop this up and he'll lose
Democrats who have decried the building of a wall on the Southern Border and tried to stop it seem to be just cool with fencing keeping Americans out of their government as long as it protects Congress.
"Retrumplicans really brought this down.....lol. BTW, bought in at $44.05. Thanks for the great entry!! Jack Dorsey for, ""Man of the year""!"

"JIM COLLINS Jan 15, 2021 | 11:45 AM ESTStocks quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good!"
How can a real American live with themselves by owning this stock?
I don't want to live in a world where Big News and Big Tech dictate my values and action.

I would consider buying TWTR stock at $3.00 and if Dorsey and his entire team are absolutely gone.
"For all your Twitter investors, please watch this video -> exposing how Twitter INTENTIONALLY censor the contents we are seeing, and please ask yourself if this is the type of company you want to support?

"Imagine the irony that it takes the Democrats, the political party of slavery to bring back segregation and try to make it cool again. I’d say unbelievable but it’s far to easy to believe unfortunately. They’ll give liberals a protected social media and space to converse online and then grant conservatives permission to go recreate our own, separate platforms from scratch. WAKE UP PEOPLE."
Dorsey will be jailed very soon. Leaked video from Satan himself detailing his true intent for the platform. Government not happy!
"I was suspended for life years ago because of a negative Hillary comment but they wont allow me to deactivate my account ""because I'm suspended"". In short, Jack can count my account when selling ads, even though I can't use it."
Anybody has an idea technically how deep this could fall? $220-$230 short term possible? Looks like downwards pressure is building for $FB en $TWTR Tia
if you wanna see what's in store for Twitter look at MOMO 1 year chart. that's if your lucky.
There's no denying it now --- TWTR is the digital era equivalent of book burning.
The rollover is in play. There are many attractive investment options. Why would anyone stay here unless you're on the short side? Is it a TDS hangover symptom?

"Twitter always had a problem monetizing their service which is why the stock really never went anywhere and I agree with Jim that it wasn't smart to ban the biggest draw they had, I'm sure thier share holders appreciate that Jack thought of being a moral cop before he thought of his share holders, that can be the end of a company because the decision making at the top has the wrong priorities for the share holders, he may feel better but his company may now die, their are competitors that will rise that allow free speech."

"I think this whole big tech mess has actually been a good thing. I have gone to small businesses and pro freedom of speech companies to buy my goods and services now. When using Amazon you are paying Jeff Bozo when you could be buying directly from the seller and saving money and supporting small businesses directly. I am enjoying finding new online sites and small shops in my area. I have found EVERYTHING online that I had with Amazon. When I deleted my Amazon account there was a subscription box that I gave up, but I found it online direct from the company. I guess I just assumed you had to go through Amazon to get a lot of the things I had bought off of Amazon. I am having a grand time finding new places to get my goods so this has actually been a good thing. The only thing I am still missing is Parler. I hope they come back! There isn't another social media site online like them that I can find yet. I liked the whole design of their site and all the many people I met on there. I have Gab and ChatDit and Rumble and I don't miss Youtube. I am SORRY though for all the creators on there that are losing money by people deleting their accounts or not watching YouTube. I hope all my favorite creators move to Rumble or the other free speech video sites and I can find them soon."

"Isn’t it remarkable how after the Capitol was attacked Democrats found their moral compasses on criminality. When our businesses were burned & looted throughout the Summer Democrats were silent. When Police were attacked everyday killed and injured they were silent. When BLM injured dozens of Secret Service outside the White House Democrats were silent When the President had to be secured in the WH bunker silence again. They were silent when every statue was pulled down Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln not matter they were silent. The media encouraged violence, with CNN & MSNBC reporting as mobs looted, and fires burning in the background they were peacefully protest. Only when polls started to show their numbers dropping did they in a loud whisper say they were against violence. What happened at the Capitol we all agree was wrong. But how easily a man dressed as a furry and the rest of the rioters made as far as they did must be answered. The Capitol Police were warned, along with the DC Mayor the day before by the FBI. But the Mayor refused to activate the National Guard. Now 21,000 Guard are surrounding DC. Ask yourself why?"

80% of time I did not agree with Trump but to have TWTR remove the US president from the platform is a disgrace. Founding fathers made sure all citizens have the right to free speech.
