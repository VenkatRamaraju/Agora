hey democommunists i know its hard for you to follow the bouncing ball but lets try to keep it real simple for you you are the one cheering the banning of people on social media you are the one cheering for separation of races you are the one that supports the brown shirt riots in our streets you are the one that repeats the propaganda lies from the fake media with provable lies you are the one calling for people you dont agree with to be put in reeducation camps you are the one who cheers when peoples books are not allowed therefore book burning them you are the one who wants to shut down businesses if they dont want to make a certain cake or agree with your ideology you want full control of the government with no checks on the things you want to control you want people to have dependency on he government from cradle to grave you are the fascist and you dont even realize it lol oh your handlers must be laughing at useful idiots like you telling themselves what a good reeducation job they did on youdoes this sound like you democrats answer yesthe nassies like mussolini were fascists in their aim of centralized government control under a oneparty system with the curtailment of regional and personal independence hittler sought to separate the youth of germany from the old ideals through education into nassie ideologyconservatives are the antithesis of the original fascists and fascist ideology conservatives believe in checks on government power whether in terms of checks among branches and state vs federal or checks between competing parties conservatives want to maintain and support nongovernment institutions like the church and family and social organizations and prevent overweening government in local affairsconservatives inherently distrust power in the hands of any individual group of individuals or party whether nassie or socialist they seek to further individual freedoms the fascists hated and sought to end like free speech the individual right to bear arms and the individual rights of families in education

jim collins jan 15 2021  1145 am eststocks quotes in this article twtrafter thursdays column i feel it is the right time to delineate my case against twitter twtr  so much of what i read in the financial media not on twitter as i deactivated my account last week on stocks is subjective numbersfree blather and in fact quite useless so i have made it clear that twitter is awful and awfully overvalued but lets focus on the second parthow about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock trust me it feels good almost as good as deleting your twitter accountfirst we start with revenues i am limited in space in this column so wont have time to delve into twitters profitability metrics but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of revs so i will stick with that the key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregationfor twitter we start  and finish  with the one metric given by management mdaus or monetizable daily active users twitter changed to this metric in february 2019 and in and of itself it is meaningless but it is a good base for modeling twitters recent quarterly report showed 187 million mdaus with 36 million users in the us and 152 million abroad i am assuming the difference is due to roundingthats where jack dorseys ship will start to sink twitter  and every social media company  receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who dont actually use the service but do have an account but with this latest movement  of which i am glad to be a part  folks are deactivating their twitter accounts not just ignoring themthose user numbers are going to plummet i would expect this to happen when firstquarter figures are reported in april not as much when fullyear results are reported feb 9 how low can they go well twitters mdau base is small to begin with so that the initial dropoff will be quite noticeableit is the international figure that is more difficult to divine twitters public affairs division thursday astoundingly criticized the government of uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election didnt twitter just do that repeatedly here in the us but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian twitter has never been available in mainland china for instanceon a real user basis i would expect twitter usage to fall by about 50 here in the us and for the service to be banned in some other countries and for the others to fall in line with the uss decline that gets you to 365  500 the banned and 102 5 the nonbanned internationals that leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for twitter of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mdaus ious pdqs or whatever new metric they can concoct on twitters reported figures the revenue per mdau best to use a rolling fourquarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number was 1811 in the third quarter which is astounding obviously no one would ever pay to use twitter and i was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics extract that figure  thats aggressive by the way the ru will fall as the user base falls  and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million and you get a real annualized revenues figure of 125 billion for twitter this contrasts with the fullyear figure of 346 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at twitter of 325 billion this company was already shrinkingbut now the dam will burst in my vieweven after this weeks pullback twtr shares inexplicably were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of thursdays close but using our true revenue estimate of 125 billion we derive a fair value for twtr of 1563 this ignores the fact that twtr had over 7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of sept 30 and valuation is as much an art as a science but i am just doing a back of the envelope hereso theres your math last friday twtr closed at 51 this thursday it closed at 45 my fair value implies that it should be worth 16that is a short regardless of what you think of the companys management and i think i have made my opinions abundantly clear twtr shares are just plain overvalued bet against them as you are deactivating your account it will feel good

clearly the new socialist party in power and corporations that support censorship are supporting the stock today it will not work twtr is doomed
a while back i saw an article trying to estimate the value of trump to twtr this was 4 years ago when the stock was 15 they had trump at 2 billion add 4 years of growth because of trump being president and all the other conservative personalities who were also deleted it was not only trump and all their followers and replies retweets and retweeted retweets so on and so on then look at the profitability of the company or rather the lack of it this will very likely swing them to a loss and if angry conservatives start boycotting advertisers this could be extremely damaging this isnt some spineless advertiser caving because of one or 2 angry liberals this is half the country while there may be damage tomorrow the real damage will come over the next few quarters neither trump nor his 887 million followers are ever coming back ever this is a permanent self inflicted injury by someone with a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders this will very likely be the largest shareholder lawsuit action history
conservatives are dumping this stock as fast as they can
if this was normal monday twtr would be in 43s or lower
put twtr on search option on facebook and twitter all is silent they worried af right now
amazon now has joined the censorship sweeping america by cutting off their servers to parler effective at midnight conspiracy theories need no further introduction as big tech hasshown they the true conspirators trying to destroy america

best way to combat this blatant attack on the 1st amendment is to sell all your shares and deactivate your twitter there’s plenty of money to be made in other companies but when s hits the fan are you gonna look back on this as someone who at least tried or did you lay down close your eyes and take it
pull up the onemonth chart and have a look at the trend the trend is not a friend for longs could be wrong
ya the only reason i had twitter was to see what potus says next 
almost time for bed if i can sleep got to be up early for the glee of watching twitter die a very public and painful death including rico charges
twitter is unamerican
the idea at twitter one would imagine is to gain users along with monetizing active ones what we are seeing unfold before our eyes is a massive user exit it reminds me of my aol stock owning days i’m showing my age so many people could not come to grips including myself of the massive amount of people that were leaving to find something betteronce stock holders figured it out

twitter is nothing more than a liberal cesspool of steaming hypocrisy they’re seeking to surround themselves in a giant social media safe place they need one alright one that’s nice and padded where they can’t injure themselves or others
if you’re investing your money into twitter then you have too much money on your hands i figure and if you’re buying now you deserve to lose  invest in something worthwhile

twitter chased off a lot of conservatives to another place then blocked that place only after they had closed their twitter account how do you like them apples
this stock would be much lower if we knew how many million people deleted that bird in a box icon in the last week
i’ve done tech longer than bat kid has demanded attention nobody measures accounts nobody counts accounts hotmail doesn’t count how many registered of half registered or verified or unverified accounts it has and microsoft doesn’t report that number the numbers they do care about are activity page views retweets ad views ad clicks and looking at the group on 16 not only are they freeloaders they never click on twitter ads and never buy anything advertised that’s why it’s 0 value keeping them and their impressions and their risky activities getting a sweet jasmine or mypillowbiter ad over at defunct gruparler wasn’t so special

ceo john matze posted to the parler platform on sunday sparking rumors that the site will be brought back online imminently the message dated january 16 suggests the social network found a new cloud hosting platform after parler was booted from amazon web services
veritas has now released a video from a whistle blower that jack dorsey stated he is going to continue to censor conservatives as a larger project going forward the video is posted on gateway pundit for investors to see if i didnt know any better i wold swear jack dorsey is on a suicide mission involving twitter as a result i see twitter continuing its downward spiral which is roughly down 18 off the highs on january 6th i dont see that changing as twitter will reach the thirties over the coming weeks this film wont do investors any good who believe jack should try and repair those on the right which make up half of the nation my guess is that twitter lost at least 44 million of the 88 million subscribers who followed trump so you might say the cancel culture cancelled twitter

god knows that greed will destroy us if we become focused on accumulating more wealth we become focused and driven by greed and are never content often greed opens the door to other sins and we find ourselves falling farther from god and what he has for our lives we must be careful to protect our hearts and minds against greed and to practice contentment not only to live being satisfied and thankful for what god has given us but also in being generous in giving

twitter always had a problem monetizing their service which is why the stock really never went anywhere and i agree with jim that it wasnt smart to ban the biggest draw they had im sure thier share holders appreciate that jack thought of being a moral cop before he thought of his share holders that can be the end of a company because the decision making at the top has the wrong priorities for the share holders he may feel better but his company may now die their are competitors that will rise that allow free speech
loving my shorts

watch for a flood of shareholder lawsuits against twitter as the stock price continues to drop the reason for the decrease is executive mismanagement
companies that dont want to have the rug pulled out from under them by political motivated scoundrels like amazon web services should build and manage their own web servers so that amazon microsoft and other left wing democrat ceos cant destroy the company by cancelling web services all companies should learn from what amazon did to parler and not rely on companies like amazon for web services best to build your own and not rely on scoundrels for web services

lots of posts here by left wingers in response to conservatives who relish free speech the 1st amendment in the bill of rights weve lost that  also the right to practice ones religion and the right to assembly not the 2nd amendment yet  but god forbid look the institutions know that this stock is on its way out but heavily vested from strictly an investment standpoint you cannot alienate 12 of your subscibers without a loss in ad revenue theyre not dummies but for a couple of weeks attempting to mitigate losses but otherwise twitter at its current valuation is done it is that simple

i dont know about shareholders suing but even as a private frim there is arguably many laws broken since its a publicly traded company violating first amendment rights these actions would be more under the securities exchange commission rule and twtr could become a candidate for delisting under the very similar and policy invoked and utilized this week to to delist china telecoms but way before delisting twtr will be trading at 1000 the other repercussions im seeing on dark cloud websites are lists of the twtr advertisers people who fight for freedom of speech have listed and instructed to boycott those consumer products i think 75 million to 80 million people boycotting those products will get those advertisers to pull their support and advertisements from twtr by the end of next week

how did twitters stock price ascend to where it is today considering the facts it has a negative pe ratio and does not pay a dividend the answer is large revenue growth projections recent actions made by the ceo have greatly diminished twitters ability to grow their revenue in the foreseeable future coupled this with the emergence of new competitors like parler and gab looming class action lawsuits from disgruntled stockholders and the recent revelation of its association with child sex abuse the big players on wall street are going to give twitters stock price a crew cut in the not to distance future

i just got suspended by youtube for expressing my opinions which someone flagged for review and didnt like have been with them for many years and nothing like this ever happened didnt post any outright hateful things just the truth in a polite manner maybe its a good thing because i may have been spending too much time posting on their site have cancelled my facebook account many years ago because i came to the conclusion that i dont need to friend people just for the sake of friending people i like my privacy and have no desire to reconnect with people from my past and give day by day reports as to what im doing with my life was never on twitter at all and have no intention to being on there
when social media companies limit free speech then the smart thing is to stop using them just go back to using your phone and actually call someone and talk you get to hear their voice and laugh with them and its much more fun and personal ditch these companies that want to limit free speech and control the flow of ideas and thought that they disagree with at this rate we dont have to worry about the russians or the chinese meddling in our personal affairs youve got these multibillion social media companies that are doing a much better job at it
oh no its green quick quick cancel some more accounts

small fortune loss in the last two daysbig tech will not beat trumpi am just sad that innocent shareholders became cannon fodder in jack dorseys losing warmaga forever
amazing that these big tech companies have long been called out for allowing pornography on their site and they’ve acted as though entirely helpless to police it then in less than 24 hrs they could amass a seemingly coordinated attack to censor and wipeout any conservative dissenting voices with near pin point accuracy and precision these big tech companies represent the worst of america and are attempting to usurp power and authority from our constitution and take it for themselves we the american people are more powerful than they realize if we choose to be power is something to be taken or stolen which is what they’re attempting true authority is more powerful because it must be given we own this authority and will decide to do nothing or take it back which will it be folks
guys follow me on parler dropshock and leave a comment so i can follow you back we need to support each other and build parler up into a competitor for these liberal tech giants also remember to deactivate your accounts and not just delete the apps that way during the earnings call it shows as a massive drop in users to really get the point across

users leaving twtr is only just beginning millions have left already  but thats just the beginning not many advertisers will want to waste money on this sinking ship those that do will only do so because the decision makers for those companies are as far left wing as dorsey wasting company money to advertise just to support someone elses political stance will not sit too well with those companies and heads will roll this ship is sinking  and its not alone
this is very clearly being held up by the establishment they can only do that for so long tho only a matter of time before we see 30s

i thought freedom of speech is when you can voice a different perspective on truth the research you do to make a winning stock trade should also be made in how you understand the news  follow a variety of news outlets and watch a half hour each day of msnbc fox cnn and even 15 minutes of newsmax by doing this you will have a great balance on what the truth is if you follow news on the net such as twitter or facebook and focus on as many as two similar articles whether positive or negative those platforms algorithms will feed you similar stories backing up the same view this puts people in a herd of thinkers that could follow lies and false beliefs these algorithms are not acceptable to freedom of finding the truth  it could lead many down a dark rabbit hole many who lost work because of covid shut downs seemed to want to follow reasons why they lost their jobs its because of covid and i feel their pain just as the algorithmic codes run the stock market we still do our research to see the truthplease understand sites like twitter and facebook havent focused on whats true because they make greater fees if they take you down whatever rabbit hole you choose remember your worth more than your financial success things will get better you have to have social emotional physical and spiritual success in your life to be balanced i know most or at least many feel financial success may be the greatest of them all  know that covid has tested each of us and many are fedup with life  this time in our history will soon pass and brighter days are ahead

twtr ccp and fb what do they have in common
finally twitter has showed their hand and it is clear that they are not a platform for free speech and that they dont just lean to the left  they are the leftfinally cnbc and msnbc bias headlines are so ridiculous and how they reported on recent event verses the events of last summer make it clear that they are done even trying to pose as news channels  they are the left and are simply tv shows presenting content for the leftduring the peaceful protests burning looting murder and destruction of our cities we saw left owned and left supporting companies pressure twitter to block and censor the voices of people they disagreed with and feared by removing add spending or threatening future add spending therefore trying to hurt twitters revenue  twitter gave in and became editors and censors now the the fake news brainwashed left is being forced to see that polling was corrupt and they are not the giant majority of the nation that they have been acting and talking like for the last four years not far from fifty percent of us voters support trump and are  off at twitter and are cancelling accountsless accounts equals less views per add which equals add space being worth less and less revenue if you are against censorship or if you you feel twitter has done you your vote trump and the nation wrong through censorship then dont just stop using twitter  also boycott and dont spend money at the companies that advertise on twitter are therefore supporting censorship

fb and tweeter are self destructing
big legal trouble for twtr on their last 10q under risk factors the closest they come to censorship is what others do to them and not the other way aroundthis is what i foundactions by governments or others to restrict access to twitter or censor content on twitter such as how domestic internet service providers in china have blocked access to twitter and other countries including iran libya pakistan turkey and syria have intermittently restricted access to twitter whether these actions are taken for political reasons in response to decisions we make regarding governmental requests or content generated by people on twitter or otherwise

stock quotes in this article twtrafter thursdays column i feel it is the right time to delineate my case against twitter twtr  so much of what i read in the financial media not on twitter as i deactivated my account last week on stocks is subjective numbersfree blather and in fact quite useless so i have made it clear that twitter is awful and awfully overvalued but lets focus on the second parthow about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock trust me it feels good almost as good as deleting your twitter accountfirst we start with revenues i am limited in space in this column so wont have time to delve into twitters profitability metrics but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of revs so i will stick with that the key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregationfor twitter we start  and finish  with the one metric given by management mdaus or monetizable daily active users twitter changed to this metric in february 2019 and in and of itself it is meaningless but it is a good base for modeling twitters recent quarterly report showed 187 million mdaus with 36 million users in the us and 152 million abroad i am assuming the difference is due to roundingthats where jack dorseys ship will start to sink twitter  and every social media company  receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who dont actually use the service but do have an account but with this latest movement  of which i am glad to be a part  folks are deactivating their twitter accounts not just ignoring themthose user numbers are going to plummet i would expect this to happen when firstquarter figures are reported in april not as much when fullyear results are reported feb 9 how low can they go well twitters mdau base is small to begin with so that the initial dropoff will be quite noticeableit is the international figure that is more difficult to divine twitters public affairs division thursday astoundingly criticized the government of uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election didnt twitter just do that repeatedly here in the us but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian twitter has never been available in mainland china for instanceon a real user basis i would expect twitter usage to fall by about 50 here in the us and for the service to be banned in some other countries and for the others to fall in line with the uss decline that gets you to 365  500 the banned and 102 5 the nonbanned internationals that leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for twitter of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mdaus ious pdqs or whatever new metric they can concoct on twitters reported figures the revenue per mdau best to use a rolling fourquarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number was 1811 in the third quarter which is astounding obviously no one would ever pay to use twitter and i was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics extract that figure  thats aggressive by the way the ru will fall as the user base falls  and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million and you get a real annualized revenues figure of 125 billion for twitter this contrasts with the fullyear figure of 346 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at twitter of 325 billion this company was already shrinkingbut now the dam will burst in my vieweven after this weeks pullback twtr shares inexplicably were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of thursdays close but using our true revenue estimate of 125 billion we derive a fair value for twtr of 1563 this ignores the fact that twtr had over 7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of sept 30 and valuation is as much an art as a science but i am just doing a back of the envelope hereso theres your math last friday twtr closed at 51 this thursday it closed at 45 my fair value implies that it should be worth 16that is a short regardless of what you think of the companys management and i think i have made my opinions abundantly clear twtr shares are just plain overvalued bet against them as you are deactivating your account it will feel good

did anyone see coverage of jacks brilliant idea on their local or network tv newsi guess that’s what they mean by democracy dies in the dark
there is right and wrong freedom is freedom not dictated by what a company government or individuals decides we can’t dare gamble with this
wht you deserve

the only thing that bites about this from an investment perspective is that twtr will have already fallen off a cliff in pre market on monday before i get a chance to short it cant trade pre market with my broker till 7am
remember to cancel your useless twitter fakebook  instagram accounts and move over to free speech media platforms cancel them the same way they cancel you
changed my position to short this unamerican stock
the legion of demons are being cast out

deactivated my twitter account i find it comical that when you click deactivate the only message you get is sorry to see you go goodbyewho knows what will happen to the stock i sold my mere 400 shares in my retirement account friday im out because i cannot be a part of a company that is clearly attacking our rights
i really think jack goebbels dorsey is getting tired of twatter you can tell the distractions its causing him from keeping focused on grooming his beard and nose rings i look for him to end up selling twatter for anyone who takes it once it dives to the 510share region
down 15 comments suggesting 15
im 100 sure that next weeks twtr will be  38
to be all honest what do you charge king neptune with his spear standing in the halls of the capital with when compared to the looters we saw in all major cities over the summer who got charged with nothing but got away with billions in small business owners inventory i think if you add the lives lost over the summer tied to the riots police lost like 25 members and the damage done in those cities maybe as high as 700 billion i do think twtr leaving the iran presidents twtr site active over the president of the free world is a joke its why the capital markets will show twtr what freedom of speech means in the usa right or wrong  democrat or republican freedom of speech will not be controlled by social networks in the usa those who try to control it well look at the close of trading on friday for twtr
read today that isis has been recruiting and plans to reignite their reign of terror and murder the day after the inauguration
what possible headline could turn this thing around
literally could go to 30 bucks within days half the float is unloading
india is banning twitter from being used in their country india is 3 in the world for twitter users india is taking a stand against corporations that are silencing free speech
delete twitter and fb have some dignity
i think twitter has made a big mistake my opinion
will be back in the 20s by march 1
i knew my yahoobias post would disapper  pronto
i admit i have never used twitter and had to do some research on what value it has i am baffled as to why people need a social media avenue that seems to divide our country after accessing twitter i an glad i never got involved in the drama you have to ask yourself are you a better person with twitter in your life the healing wont begin until services like this get some controls
what you people voted for red days ahead
maria bartiromo on fbn just said on friday she reached one million followers on twtr so she took a snap shot of it today her followers are down to 911000in other words people are leaving in droves 
could be wrong but i think twtr is headed to high 30s before the week is over

its always a good sign when the chart looks like a roller coaster ride down right
the only reason this price gets pumped because tons of shares need to be dumped
this administration doesnt know if its a guy or gal
aapl twtr amzn fb look at the charts today all artificially being pumped up you’re going to get a few good days but it’s a slow and steady ride to the bottom people are leaving their products and services because censorship isn’t good for anyone regardless of party
twitter facebook and google are nothing but air less and less of it by the dayfb aapl goog
they’re coming to take you away hahaa heavymetal guitarist the alleged leader of a colorado paramilitary training group and two exmilitary militia members from ohio have been charged with allegedly taking part in the riot at the capitol last week as the fbi ratchets up its investigation into the role extremist groups played in storming the building

goldman sach upgraded the target price of snap chat at the price of 70 today we must write to the twitter board and demand a resignation of jack dorsey snap chat doesnt have to spend a billion dollars to do stock buyback and the price has already gone over 51 with the higher target price of 70 twitter has not even re test the 2014 high of 57 dollars while snap chat keeps making new high what does this tell you twitter stock price will not improve as long as we keep jack dorsey on board as a part time ceo
twitter is old looks old feels old its old
blm protest
they are not the thought police they silenced the the president and the citizens by throwing a switch to turn off parler app very wrong on so many levels i hope they burn if you use server farms you are not in control of your company 
sellers in control
little blue bird is flying too close to the sun todaylook at all those open call options do you think they will pay out tomorrow
send dorsey to the poor house sell sell sell
just sold all my twtr holdings can not invest in a company that ignores the 1st amendment i actually made some money on this turd which i will donate to the free speech alliance
to the world who looks for retribution against communism sell twitter
one of these days a big business ceo is going to realize that their company should be indifferent to all things political and focus on delivering to their customers the best product at affordable prices a business should be non political and ceos should keep their political views private
freedom of speech only if they approve of what you say only way to fight is to cancel they understand one thing money help sink the stock cant ask you to drop your face book but dont buy anything from them hit back were it hurts the pocket book tell your friends not to buy from them make a little sacrifice now why you still can stand up for the american way
just closed amazon flipped them the bird for their censorship
rush pulled his twitter account like him or not like the president or not this is not good for business dumping my shares and moving on dorsey is a freak show anyway this stocks performance is a joke and its just going to get worse they may have overplayed their hand
amazing what you can read on twtr these days apparently wyoming republicans think its just fine for a sitting us president to stage an insurrection to undo a legitimate election shameful not sure what were coming to i hope liz cheney runs as an independent if she doesnt get the gop nomination  i think shed win
let’s short it
geez anybody that looks like this we should trust
satan has a twitter account
leftists are crying their twitter investments are underwater
how are the 300 twitter employees feeling this morning  you know the ones the newspapers said wrote a letter to jack dorsey demanding he shut the account down  ancient history gave us the original 300 the ancient spartan warriors of greece who held off an invading army  modern history gives us 300 keyboard warriors who tanked their own company
it seems the left leaning people still supporting twitter and whoever else has stayed on have not even considered the fact there may be a wave of cyber attacks coming against the company and its platform users
twtr was up 350 in the last 4 years prebiden now already making decisions to alienate half of its user base at the pain of its shareholders get ready for the ride down
what’s funny is twitter will probably have good numbers on 29 and will most likely pad guidance this ship needs to be sunk before earnings
the haircut here is just beginning
how long will dorsey’s jurk off investors keep pumping money into this disaster
why hasn’t jack dorsey been arrested for lying under oath about twitter’s censorship policies
the only positive thing about today is its one less day we have to put up with dementia boy and kamel toe gonna be a loooong funny 4 years unless 
corporations that have cut off donations for the gop after the riots the house impeached 45att conocophillips dow inc facebook ups jpmorgan boa wells fargo citi amazon comcast ge bcbs marriott microsoft google verizon bp boston sci goldman deutsche bank signature bank blackrock airbnb amex visa mastercard bestbuy exxonmobil and more to come and even though every other social mediaapp platform suspended 45 fan boys are still saying “let’s short twitter”

y politicians thank god for the second amendment it equalizes everything i have a hunch that the stock market goes down huge on january 20th or before 20 correction crazy to say but this yahoo message board has more freedom of speech than any of the social media lol
twitter is for bag holders this will not be going up anytime soon
its like an experiment in gravity invest and descend at a constant rate of 98 ms2 sell
dont forget to mail your generous donation checks to trumps newest foundation so that he can continue to fund his moneylosing golf courses pay his evermounting debts and keep his lawyers in the manner to which theyre accustomedreminds me of a televangelist that gets the aged widows to send him their social security because god told him that he needs a new jethey at least mexico paid for the wall the audited tax returns were shown and we got our seven years in the making covers more people for less repealed and replaced and rolled out on day one healthcare planbigly believe me conthief maga  masks are gawdawful

censorship and cancellation is the core of twtr thats why it will fail  why i dumped it for greener and profreedom opportunities suppression of any expression is antithetical to understanding if someones ideas greatly offend you or everyone else you can just ignore it despite the current popularity of safetyism words cant harm you only you can with your own serious mental distortions
i keep my short positions over night

it could certainly happen today but i think the chances are it will happen later this week im talking about the bottom falling out of this a quick drop under 44 and this stock is ready to drop a lot of money

america is also freedom of choice america you have a choice i am a finance guy but have a minor in law i was reading about legal challenges twit may face it will be tough they are a private company some one could challenge them and focus on their consistency of applying their own policies that may have a leg to stand on arbitrary deleting and suspending accounts if they did it to president because of violence threat ok although i may not agree ok but letting iran keep up its post on killing americans and yahoo police its a fact go look at it is opening them up for legal challenges the way to get back at twit is to delete your accounts thats freedom of choice dont use their service that is the most powerful action americans can take that dont agree its very simple advertisers want return for their  they will drop twitter or ask for reduced rates twitter earnings will suffer stock price will tank good luck

if parler is unable to go up i will buy it nd host it from russia india brazil and china thats like 3 billon people right there so even if democrats ban it in us it wont matter but if dems ban it they will risk putins poison carriers because it will be a pro putin platform

regardless of what you think fueling fire politically one way or another is not good for either or both sides some of you would know that if you ever paid attention to history while that said twitter is overreaching and suppressing people while you may not like the people they are suppressing it’s not right if it were you being suppressed how would that feel i care about americans and american rights no company platform or person has a right to take them from you so i short twitter and will continue to do so regardless of what side you stand on you should be standing for your rights as americans

dont forget the 10 for the big guy
sell calls buy puts all the way to the bottom
just a reminder to everyone that twitter is yet another money losing business in this gigantic massive stock market bubble

lol there is an article that states “what’s the better buy facebook or twitter” is this person living in a bubble these are two of america’s most hated companies we are canceling our accounts twitter is losing money amd is losing accounts how’s that going to work
twitter and facebook exist solely to sell your personal information to third parties they dont care who they sell your information to they even sell it to bad actors outside the usa who will use it to steal your ids and defraud you this is fact theyve been caught doing it zuckerberg lied to congress and claimed he didnt know he was doing this well justice is coming to them facebook and twitter are on their last days
anyone still holding this stock or using the app stands for communism it’s all fun and games when it’s happening to your political adversary but when it happens to you you’ll be crying in the street no one will have sympathy for you then go back and research the tweet from pelosi on may 16 2017 crying about the election being stolen sound familiar it was perfectly fine when she and the dems did it then go look up the nov 132018 tweet where she welcomed the “activists” and strongly urged capitol police to allow them to protest see you call them activists of them supporting dem cause and rioters and insurrectionists if they’re against the dem cause hypocrisy knows no bounds as a democrat
with all the legal beagles big tech has you would have thought someone in the legal profession would have been aware of military code 113 i guess when you are above it all following the law is not a requirement the lawsuits that will follow dorsey and zuckerberg without corporate protection will last years
expect rightwing governments around the world to heavily regulate or ban twitter for good

sue jack save freedomin recent days i’ve been made aware of dozens of conversations by former twitter users that thousands of people might not only be eligible to sue bigtweet but expect a bit of a payday in doing sobeginning the day following the january 6th activities in washington dc jack dorsey got aggressive hostile and intentional in the mishandling of his enterprisethe argument that twitter—as a private company—can do what they wish with impunity is holding less water as the scope of the malfeasance is coming to lightby estimates from my own observation and discussion with others dorsey intentionally maligned the welfare of his company in most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecondhis actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectationsand last week jack dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath he did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation his actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to 7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product an audienceso there are plenty of reasons shareholders the public and former twitter users should consider legal recourse

over the last 4 years weve seen people beaten in airports and on streets and ejected from restaurants just because they were wearing a hat someone didnt like attending a political rally was to walk through a throng of shrieking belligerents to ask unpopular questions or express an opinion about how votes are counted and processed and how a count can run negative is to be called a liar and deranged where is twitter and facebook during all of this busy helping america decay
mitch mcconnell made an appearance today
74000000 americans and many more are disgusted by twitters outrageous attempt to to censor the conservative voice in america twitter will pay for it the fcc will be on their back and watch twitter shares plummet
just one more ride on the coalfueled air force one golf cart and its off into the sand traps in the orange sunset
today i deleted my twitter account which ive had for 10 years cancelled amazon prime cancelled youtube tv next im ditching att for a better isp service
another new low is that good
the constitution is america
twitter public policy policy 1122021ahead of the ugandan election were hearing reports that internet service providers are being ordered to block social media and messaging apps we strongly condemn internet shutdowns – they are hugely harmful violate basic human rights and the principles of the openinternetfrom the you cant make this up files
mlk preached unity twitter represents division not a single left wing person or group has complained about censorship
the us is focusing on american politicians but the actions by twtr et al have an international blowback basically people like german chancellor merkel have openly stated disagreement with twtr and others because they see that they could be silenced but those countries will shut them down first not good for the shareholder value too much downside risk
only way to cripple the monopoly of big tech is to impose 75 taxes on their profits good for america well bernie can do that i guess

delete your twitter accountobama started race riots and twitter allowed him to keep tweeting they also allow frakahn and the ayatollah to tweetgo figure
i just cant see how twtr survives going forward its not as fun as snap ig or tiktok and its not as interactive and comprehensive as facebook its not as useful as texting whatsapp or zoom and it just removed its 1 content creator its basically the askjeeves of social networks which makes sense since it came out before the iphone
guess u guys are right as of now in 465 210 shares losing money
can you imagine twitter with just liberals and democrats it would be similar to a modern day clan meeting
institunional investors will soon start runing away how can any respectable firm put its money into a company that is so unpredictable what if one day after a long crack smoking session jack dorsey will deside that twitter will fund north koreas nuclear program how reliable is that
no people need twtr but twtr needs people when you leave it you will find that you dont need it to live
do you think twitter can survive as long as the rioting going on in portland
twtr is going down faster then kamila harris did on her former boss
shorting this from now on it should be and must be an opportunity to express yourself freedom of speech i think twitter lost their core daily user by this move we all know that what heother did was wrong but come on norway
my friend called this exactly he made his profits in the premarket and got out before the market opened

you might be a seditionist if1 you didnt want young americans serving in endless combat for decades overseas2 you wanted america to preserve its manufacturing base and jobs3 you wanted domestic energy independence instead of supporting regimes that persecute gays and trample civil rights4 you wanted low taxes to make domestic business more competitive5 you thought a fine for not buying health insurance from private companies was unfair6 you believe its important to stand with and support one of the few democracies in the middle eastthese are the hallmarks of a  begone you evil insurrectionists
how can these demoncrats look at the pictures of hunter and the little girls and pass that off as okay how can they continue to deny the strong documentary evidence that hunter and joe were on the fiddle in ukraine
dorsey did say it will better in the long run maybe 100 years from now you will see the highs

when republicans get back in power they will shut down this antifree speech platform
there’s about to be some big changes coming down the pike for not only twitter but fb as well these online platforms along with others have profited off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of misinformation among americans that has caused hate and division within our country they’re platforms are being used as tools to organize mass riots all over the us i’ve been against fb and twitter from the very beginning it was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be shutdown there is very little if anything “social” about them
twitter stock targetprice 1000

this country is going to have an ex military and maybe active military problem its already started as several of those in the capitol building are highly trained highly decorated us military they took an oath to the constitution and the constitution was not followed with those states changing their election ruleslaws even democrats understand that a rejection rate dropping from 3 to under 5 is not a trustworthy result with the number of mailed in ballots the rejection rate would be up not down

twtr business model is too political and too risky to exist it’s not only tanking this time it’ll literally disappearing faster than we expect that’s why jack dorsey keeps asking others to take over and uses sq as an excuse to leave yes he knew it what a rare shorting opportunity 
im going to get directly to the point jack dorsey does not giving a flying bats  about you shorting or selling twtr shares yes twitter will go down and possibly loose ground in the long run especially in terms of new subscriptions and organic growth jack dorsey has square sq trading on the nyse at 24145 a share it is a payment processing platform unless every small business and its shareholders bails out of that ship twitter will just be a small kink he may step down focus on square and just be on the board of twitter all the democrats with deep pockets and his fellow tech friends will prop this to the moon their resolve will be far stronger just because of the deep pockets and connections they have if one falls they all fall they wont let that happen
ouch 5 days in a row
biden will be forgotten pretty quickly  trump will be remembered for a long long time
following the tweets number of people are deactivating their twitter accounts
twitter has never previously banned a head of state which means all the present and former despots and dictators of the world are still on twitter but the potus is not twitter is being run by a bunch of woke leftists
going into the 30s by wednesday
dont overlook this the deactivation of all the highest profile conservative accounts will also result in a severe reduction of progressive counterpoint reactions its a severe traffic killer and a double whammy against twtrthe stock may get propped up in the short term but paraphrasing titanic the ship will sink it is a mathematical certainty
looks like the market does not like bidens spending plans so it begins hey wall street trump was good for you so how come you backed losers like clinton and the cheat biden who will drive down the market
my followers on twitter dropped from 5900 to 4670 since announcement yesterday some larger followings went from 295k to 210kthis appears to be a pretty big decrease in users usually i always dismiss this type of stuff and say it will blow over but this one seems liie it has longer lasting legs to it and face it the growth days of twitter arent that great anyways they got killed last earnings user data is going to be very interesting next call strong sell imo
this thing will go to 0000
shorts and people closing their accounts took control of twitters price
barney rubble from the flintstones with his water buffalo hat on with his american flag and spear some call him king neptune that representation is not about what occurred on january 6th that was just part of the piled on circus side shows the reasons why twtr stock will plunge is also really separate from the events of january 6th the reason why twtr stock will fall is about social medias actions relating to freedom of speech youd have to go back to paul revere and the lanterns to understand that twtr has violated the first amendment and for that the free world their is a price to pay the usa citizens saw this type of control in china and russia the suppression of free speech for years our free capital markets will surly send a message to not only twtr but to facebbook google and others in that group for many months to come will be product boycotts of advertisers as products on those sights there are 65 to 80 million americans and maybe more who understand the freedom of speech and no change in administration is going to allow that to occur

all true americans should delete their twitter account tonight we should not support censorship of anyone
most people in congress are thugs and they are for themselves and money not for the people we need a congress that consists people that can talk reasonably about politics on both sides and more friendlier the government is corrupted at all levels now and we need to fix it
notice the words in the first amendment below where it reads peaceably plus how can someone speak freely when they are afraid for their safety also freedom of speech does not mean you can lie and slander each other we must stop hating each other we have a lot more problems ahead of us it is 2021 i know we are smarter than thisthe first amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion expression assembly and the right to petition it forbids congress from both promoting one religion over others and also restricting an individual’s religious practices it guarantees freedom of expression by prohibiting congress from restricting the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely it also guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and to petition their government

why does the media facilitate don lemon trying to associate conservatives with any nasty hate group he can think of including the clan and national socialists such comparison being made on the basis of identity politics and not on true actions or beliefsjust whether he can produce an example of a bad person who happens to vote one way or the other and branding everyone that way it is a fact that no republicans owned any slaves a year before the civil war that the republican party was formed to eliminate slavery that the republican party introduced civil rights legislation and that the democratic party actions not mere identity supported slavery jim crow etc well into the 1960s or so in fact why tear down statutes of dead people when you have the actual organization that did all that alive and well today reparations go talk to the democratic party

this will be like aol and netscape get out while you can to my conservative allies we don’t need to do everything at once if we show one tech company at a time  this time twitter  and create our own platforms counterparts to the other mainstream platforms will come about a multimillionaire or billionaire would be silly not to cater to conservative minded people for those platforms they’d literally make a boat load will it take a while sure but as with the story with the tortoise and the hare we learn that slow and steady wins the race

the media all assiduously assure us in article after article that there were no antifa or blm in the capitol riot and yet the new york post and epoch times have actually researched and there were at least 2 individuals in this category and there is footage of them encouraging wrongdoing why are all the major media outlets continuing to lie to us on this issue small though it is is it because they have supported the political unrest for the last 4 years with their support for lawlessness barraging us continually with claims that someone is lying when that person has presented their opinion on an issue but otherwise suppressing news that has more substance than a gossip page
unless liberals can type twice as fast this stock is toast will lose up to half of eyeballs
jack caught by project veritas is deeply troubling he should be removed by the board for abandoning his fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders he actions are tanking the stock i will be asking my mutual funds to divest as well

there will be a massive offloading of twitter shares today the fall in share price will be faster than weve seen all week project veritas has spilled the beans on dorsey and you can bet the institutions want out asap while they can still save some of their investment get out people its going to hurt anyone caught up in this if they wont buy your limit make it a market sell because thats probably how fast this is going to drop when that happens the little man has no chance unless he gets out at market price
jack is buying in ah to make it appear to be green wasting his time dropping again tomorrow no support below

twitter is toast you guys see project veritas dorsey gonna continue to drop accounts in the coming weeksmonths etc
parler will be back just a matter of time
wikileaks just released the clinton emails dorsey isnt the only to pay for his horrific antiamerican acts
amazon web services is not the only web service providers in the world other companies are selling web services so parler can goto amazons competitors but parler can also build their own web servers and not rely on left wing run companies like microsoft amazon etc and therefore not need amazon or microsoft to flourish and then parler can ban liberal democrat companies from using its web services
all in all not a bad day because i shorted twtr early this morning the one thing jack and his type cannot handle is getting embarrassed on public forums you know he must be on the phone with yahoo right now trying to shut us down but its not happening lol
going down like obama on reggie love
soon the lawyers will file class action lawsuits against twitter for direct actions of the ceo not in the best interest of the shareholders and causing damage to the share price
the end of twitter is not near the decline of twitter toward a very poor choice among many similar service providers is well underway the technofascist oligarchy is fervently trying to deplatform the emerging providers like parler but they will fail because although they have consolidated a great deal of power through monopolistic behavior the world is waking up the ideological fascism twitter espouses

new twitter has suspended gop rep marjorie taylor greene for 12 hours45’s fanboys “who careswe worship only one man and we were going to short twitter anyway” 
sad day in america when the liberalsocialist big tech media companies shut down free speech and at the same time limit any other social media companys like parlor with the ability to compete in the market now we as americans get to see what its like in other socialist countries and the saddest thing is how young americans think socialism is ok thats what you get when the majority of liberal socialist teachers and professors are brainwashing them in the schools
all republican sell your stock this stock will loose 50 of it users sell or loose your future government will recently switch parties will face it after next election sell now or later at a lower price
americans never forget what dorsey has done not ever
imagine elon musk suggesting to half of the ev market not to buy a tesla this is what twitter is doing to their own market why nobody knows

some of their board members are from china and iran connection you bet ￼
how far will twitter drop tomorrow gab picked up 600k users yesterday

twitter and facebook not only rob you of your fundamental right of freedom of speech they also remove your right to privacy since they sell your private information and you probably wondered how you got hacked or how your personal data ended up on the dark web
so apparently they want to cancel luke skywalker now too  it’s being claimed that there is “immense pressure” from within the company to ditch the luke skywalker and baby yoda storyline from all future plans well the unnamed author says that despite hamill being very politically progressive unnamed but apparently influential lucasfilm employees associate luke skywalker with “conservatism the patriarchy maledominated narrative etc” and want nothing to do with him
so you want me to buy shares in a company which cannot make a profit pays no dividends and hands 10 million away to blm while declaring a loss at quarterly earnings
no one likes dorsey not wall street and not even his mother
whoever is buying this stock is throwing their money away 30 by their earnings almost a 50 drop in a month it will keep dropping from there

much bigger things coming for twtr11415why jack dorsey sees bitcoin as the answer to dt ban controversy bitcoin as the answer as dorsey noted the need to ensure we don’t “erode a free and open global internet” he said he was particularly passionate about bitcoin btc because of the “model it demonstrates”“a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity this is what the internet wants to be and over time more of it will be” the twitter ceo saiddorsey noted his company’s efforts to develop a decentralized standard for social media to overcome the problem of enforcement of policies“this will take time to build we are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists” the twitter ceo said “no matter the ultimate direction we will do this work completely through public transparency”

stay short
im cracking a beer and celebrating shorting this and all the money i have made watching this garbage collapse
i for one was never into social media so i did noot have to leave but hearing what these big tech is doing and thinking they can get away with it i hope those of you who are leaving or have just left understand that twitter and other similar entities realize they are in the wrong only because they are losing money and that they will change their ways that you will not go back to them its up to you of course but when people are apologetic only because they realize they are making money and you as consumers go back to them they still win my hope is that once you leave you leave for good

lol
this is where it begins to fall

btw there is no such things called conspiracy theories they are all possibilities could be false or could be true when something happens which could be anything in this universe whose cause is apparently unknown to investigate or analyze why did it happen investigators come up with several possibilities eg theories then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause thats the process 100 years ago albert einsteins created many theories that were not proven at all until now so if you use conspiracy theory then albert einsteins theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well  right in his theory legendary scientist stephen hawking said black holes could emit radiation its called hawking radiation not proven no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true so hawkings theory is a conspiracy theory  right once again there is no such things called conspiracy theories  instead they are all possibilities could be true could be false

twitter will be forced to submit to the federal government this censorship has gone on far too long
oppenheimer’s jason helfstein’s statement that he’s not concerned about the decision to silence trump shows his ignorance—or possible deception ie should he be attempting to exit under cover of an upgrade dorsey risked disenfranchising roughly half of the us market when the future of twitter—a company that has yet to prove it’s staying power—is in question does anyone really feel that twtr is important or necessary trump might have seen it as important once—but who else other than a boatload of forgettable selfabsorbed people trying to make themselves relevant

for anyone who doesnt think trump is important to twitter look at the stock chart and compare it to when he took office in 2017 in 2016 is when he was campaigning seriously now having looked at the chart  do you think is going to happen now that trump is banned trump is most likely going to move to an alternate platform and there is going to be mass exodus from the site get out before you lose your money

twitter’s future is not looking too bright the creepy ceo has moved onto other business ventures—investors should too
it might be a big storm coming
what is twitter  said every single person in 1 year 
its no accident the ceo looks a like carl marx one thing in the usa is we as americans can invoke capital markets punishment on the stock by selling twtr to bankruptcy which indeed will occur over the next 6 months when its only major client and voice of the last four years leaves it was going to happen anyway their was no way that trump organization would not be setting up its own media networks days after the president left office anyway the ceo of twtr knew that and so did we the us capital markets will invoke justice on twtr then they will get it

twitter has chosen to slice away a huge chunk of their customer basebut unlike currently out of favor pandemic distressed companies twtr will never see favor again theyve chopped off an appendage that wont grow backmaybe this is what they want maybe they want to be a small player a small player with a 100 likeminded clientele in a zero controversy echo chamberi dont know but for a publicly traded company that is arguably criminalnot sure what tomorrow brings for twtr but the future is dismal
twitter compare to fb is one trick pony their business will be hurt much more users of twitter are more politically active conservative part will be heard maybe not by voices but by loosing revenue

who expects twitter to lose 50 of their stock value today
i consider myself a moderate leaned left most of my life and now lean slightly right this latest move by twitter has even me wanting to leave the platform if i feel this way i cannot imagine what actual conservatives are feeling to me twitter has signed their death warrant as a social media giant it is a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half maybe i am completely dead wrong but i dont think so
have you had enough yet no coincidence it underperformed the market again the company destroyed itself with no regard for the shareholders just the selfishness and loathing driven by jack dorsey part time ceo has no significant financial stake in this eitherwhat does he carebut he does care about sq where he has his wealth and is also ceomaybe sq should be treated the way dorsey treated twtr shareholders which was with no regard
