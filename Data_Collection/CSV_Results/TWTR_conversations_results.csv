"How come the BLm supporter who entered the Capitol, egged-on others to burn the place down, and egged-on Ashley Babbitt, who he then filmed getting shot and dying, IS WALKING FREE! I'll tell you why, he's CIA. Look at the pictures online of him in paramilitary uniform carrying a firearm. This was all planned, and so was the reaction to it."
The trend is on. There will be a right leaning app for every leftist app. Every leftist app will see half its base leave. It will be slow in the beginning and get fast later as more and more people join new apps.
Market is up 600+ points
Millions of Twitter accounts closed. This stock will drop like a rock.
THIS SQUEEEEEEZE feels so good!!! Feels like Orange squeezed juice!!! 4% up and climbing :D
"As some point, we all need to realize that as a country we are better than what Twitter is representing. There are many great companies to trade and make nice money on like the EV stocks. So why buy Twitter? Look at WKHS today. Now that is a nice EV stock. Consider going elsewhere and support your fellow american."
"I don't know who would want to own this stock at these prices. Politics and free speech issues aside, they've made a bad business decision that they can't take back. It took them years to add those millions of users and lost them practically overnight."
TWTR will be trading in the 20’s by the end of this year.

"Jack Dorsey beware. As you ban people you don't like, so shall ye be banned by people and countries who don't like you. You will reap what you sow."
"Since jack has shown how well his company can censor free speech, maybe the CCP will be interested in a version they can use to feed propaganda to their citizens?"
Nice Close  Who's buying this Turd tomorrow?
Bubble......
"Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can. Make money on these Commies !!!"
"No worries- up slightly on relatively light volume. ""Lower"" days are just ahead."
10 straight days of GREEN. What’s next?

Wow ever since Mr. Orange got banned this thing has been on a TEAR.
"My followers on twitter dropped from 5900 to 4670 since announcement yesterday. Some larger followings went from 295k to 210k...this appears to be a pretty big decrease in users. Usually I always dismiss this type of stuff and say it will blow over, but this one seems liie it has longer lasting legs to it. And face it the growth days of Twitter arent that great anyways. They got killed last earnings. User data is going to be very interesting next call. Strong sell IMO."
and here I thought the twitter communists would at least get one day in the green.
This is another GME. wait till next earnings.
"We should cherish FREEDOM OF SPEECH"" not to suppress it. This is what Dorsey is doing. He should fire employees who are advocating it. Twitter is publicly traded company. The shareholders are in charge not employees."
"When at least 50% of the population value their First Amendment right of free speech, that does bode well for companies that actively try to censor it. I cannot imagine Twitter or Facebook will do well until this issue is resolved."
Send this to 0 where it belongs
Look at the 1-month chart. It is beautiful. Jack's wealth dropping like an anvil.
Watching the market cap of this company slowly dwindle down. Billions going bye bye. Business is Business Never get involved with politics.

I am thinking a good strategy may be to wait until this sock gets to $100 as the prophet Cramer said it would and then short it. What do y'all think?

Tomorrow the revolution starts ?
"When Parler comes back online, many of us will be reminding everyone on there to not just ignore their twitter account. They need to DELETE their twitter accounts!!"
Dorsey's anti free speech agenda is more important to him than his concern for stakeholders......this isn't going to go unnoticed...this will continue to tank....
#$%$ stock users are migrating like anything. User activity also decreased by 70% as Trump is censored. This stock will go under 20
"I thought about buying back in the 40s. Probably should have, but that ship has sailed!"
Just read about the Gubermint Snow down there in Texas. All fake snow because it won’t melt and burns when you put it in the microwave or better yet hold it above a hair dryer. I saw these and thought Yeah that’s our GRUJimmy and his tweet machine down there with putey making Texans life even more difficult.
Obsolete Tool ... young people not joining Twitter .... There is no future here

"All in all, not a bad day. BECAUSE I SHORTED TWTR early this morning... The one thing Jack and his type cannot handle is getting embarrassed on public forums. You know he must be on the phone with Yahoo right now trying to shut us down! But it's not happening, lol!"
0 upside going forward it looks like :/

brieghtbart article removed. North Dakota is allowing suits against Twitter.
"Look what happened to Goya foods when there was a boycott by the Left, the company’s revenue and profit exploded! Do not alienate half the country!￼Jack Dorsey will be fired by the board because he is accountable to the shareholders, not his ideology. With that being said, does he even care about the shareholders or his job? ￼Likely not because he’ll be a billionaire no matter what!￼"
Definite Pump and Dump going on. MKM Partners? I'm a fund manager and that's the first I've ever heard of them. Short this. The Financial Media are manipulating the gullible same as always. Meanwhile world leaders in other countries are condemning Twitter and Facebook.
" I didn't expect it comes this soon - it is the beginning of many changes for human beings, out of a traditional way in high-tech. Soon new high tech will dominant and replace the current. "
sell and go to ZOM it has been popping and will go big! not pumping but reality.
Frightened rightwingers who want to overturn elections in order to install an orange monarch have no idea how improved the twitter platform has become minus the treason. Of course the valuation is on the rise.
"MILLIONS DUMPING THEIR TWITTER ACCOUNTS. YOUR AD REVENUE WILL PLUMMET. YOUR INVESTMENT WILL PLUMMET. BUT, DON'T MIND ME. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS AND TELL IT HOW MUCH YOU LOVE IT WHILE IT SITS AT $10."
"Easy short here, no way twitter doesn’t lose millions of followers"
SELL ALL before TWTR down to $20!!
"Not a dip, the beginning of a spiral."
"If I still owned TWTR I would be upset with Jack. Big boy Jack martyred TWTR shareholders. Good job, Jack!!!"

"I too CANCELLED my Twitter account. As a Patriot and Veteran I swore to uphold the Constitution of The United States, of which FREE SPEECH is a critical component. TWTR will soon feel just how large the Silent Majority is! Oh, and I also have my first-ever order in to SHORT a stock!"
I am short too. My Pal SHORT told me to short. He has a good track record
"Dorsey: “So, the focus is certainly on this account [@realDonaldTrump] and how it ties to real world violence. But also, we need to think much longer term around how these dynamics play out over time. I don’t believe this is going away anytime soon.”Dorsey: “You know, the U.S. is extremely divided. Our platform is showing that every single day.”"
Bye bye Jack
TWTR also out on google and apple app store
Bad earning
"Patriots need to get serious about extricating GOOG from their daily lives. Yes, they have been more discreet, but they're demons in disguise. Through Youtube and Search, their level of censorship is greater and more damaging than TWTR. And, don't forget the harmful impacts GOOG has on privacy. Having said that, let's short more TWTR."
Arkk just bought... bye bye shorts
NASDAQ futures are down; after hours stock price for Twitter is down. Tomorrow could be a big down day for Twitter.
shorts are covering and insider's are buying. another up day tomorrow with snapchat earnings
"Wonder how many investors thought, wow, the liberals will support this so it won't matter, well you forgot about the majority of the population who disagree with you and the Dominion machines can't help you."

The Republican Party is eating itself alive! Meanwhile Twitter sets new highs almost daily!
From today onwards going up... tomorrow make it fresh start of new era. Hope next target $48.
"it has said, twtr has lost 48% of active users, would u put a add up? this is the end, and yes i am short ty"

It's been a fun bringing $TWTR short profits over here and leaning into this HIVE dips. Hope y'all bought the dip. Added 1000 today at like 2.23 or something
I think being a stock analyst requires no knowledge. MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni upgraded TWTR a couple days ago. Who in the world would upgrade a company in the middle of their customers leaving in droves.
Twitter must release an 8K disclosing the cancellations.
how can TD and Yahoo have such different reports? ugh!!
My advice? Buy gold.
"Canceled my twitter account and opened Parler, they don't regulate free speech"
John Wayne would hate Dorsey - MAGA

"Now that the Dennison Empire is experiencing a severe drop in revenue, I would encourage the Faithful, the ""Special"" people and the ""Loved"" people to send generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago. This one is legit, not to be confused with either the Foundation or the University.Income at Mar-a-Lago has dropped significantly. Thankfully the agreement that Mar-a-Lago would not be used as a residence will be ignored and Mar-a-Lago (the ""Club"", not the residence) will be able to continue to bill the US taxpayer for food, lodgings and golf cart rentals to the Secret Service.I would also urge you to send all your legal work to Mr. Giuliani to support him in these difficult times and to buy MAGA-branded My Pillows to support the downtrodden among us. That it all. Continue on Bigly.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Account Got Axed?"
"It looks like TWTR will be down for longer time, this process has just started. Great short candidate."
Lol at Longs. You know other companies exist right? Many of which aren’t sabotaging themselves for the globalist agenda. Have some more respect for your future and exit this reckless company

If a conservative dares to utter a political opinion that is deemed unapproved by the internet police they are now subject to false accusations of 'inciting violence' simply for having a conservative view.
Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for dinner. Liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote.

"The Super Rich Use Puerto Rico As A Tax Haven.Over the last decade, thousands of wealthy Americans have built homes, started businesses and spent a significant amount of time in Puerto Rico, all in order to take advantage of the island’s tax code that exempts them from U.S. taxes. While just a few thousand have taken advantage of the law, the U.S. federal government has potentially lost out on hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)."
Sold my 100 shares of square today based on principle. There are better places to put your money. Didn’t own Twitter or I would of sold that too! Down with Dorsey.
You know what else isn't going to be forgiven? Your rent. In fact I jut raised it. Welcome back to the plantation wagie. No more avocados for you
"how is this good news ?08:47 AM EST, 03/01/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Twitter (TWTR) said Monday it plans to offer $1.25 billion worth of convertible senior notes due in 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers.The company said it also plans to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to buy up to an additional $187.5 million of the notes.The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of Twitter, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Twitter's common stock, or a combination of both, the company said.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Twitter expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or other financial institutions, the company said.Twitter plans to use a part of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, and the remaining proceeds pay any amounts due upon conversion or at maturity of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions.share dilution ?"

"Most people here want to make money trading...I get it. If we don't stand up for democracy and our freedoms, trading in the free market could also be wiped out if we are not careful. Be careful what you wish for by keep big tech in control."
China is shorting Twitter - kind of funny
"RIP Twtter, you won't be missed!"
Muting an American for speaking in a “free country” where you’re able to say whatever you want because you are allowed to. This country is really starting to become an absolute joke. Free speech is no longer allowed in America and companies like Twitter are really throwing wood on the fire here
"Democrats are firing up the US Treasury printing presses to push this country to inflationary levels only witnessed by Germany in the 1930’s. Soon, this country will no longer resemble a Free Republic, but a socialistic puppet of China and Russia, as our history and Constitution are rewritten. The New World Order is upon us."
Down with this sort of thing... lol

"Twitter users on Thursday reported seeing their GameStop shares sold and their positions closed, with Robinhood justifying the sale due to “unreasonable risk.”"
I don’t own Twitter anymore. I’m here because I’m getting some kind of fantastic satisfaction seeing the downfall after the pent up frustrations of having the conservative voice suppressed. They all are getting what they deserve and I’m relieved.
"Goodbye Twitter, taking my profits and never looking back. You censor our freedoms you lose my business. It disgusts me when billionaire Marxist remove our voice. SELL,SELL,SELL"

Buh Bye Twitter!
This dip is not buyable.
Here’s another kicker. Twitter users are banning companies that advertise on Twitter. Soooo bad for business. Huge ouch!
"I don't know about shareholders suing but even as a private frim there is arguably many laws broken since it's a publicly traded company violating First Amendment Rights, These actions would be more under the Securities Exchange Commission rule and TWTR could become a candidate for Delisting under the very similar and policy invoked and utilized this week to to delist China Telecom's. But way before delisting TWTR will be trading at $10.00. The other repercussions I'm seeing on Dark Cloud websites are lists of the TWTR Advertisers people who fight for Freedom of Speech have listed and instructed to boycott those consumer products. I think 75 Million to 80 Million people boycotting those products will get those Advertisers to pull their support and advertisements from TWTR by the end of next week."
"MEMPHIS (The Borowitz Report)—QAnon, which has hemorrhaged supporters since Inauguration Day, has announced that it is merging with the conspiracy theory that claims Elvis Presley is still alive. The announcement, made at a press conference in a parking lot across the street from Graceland, Presley’s longtime home, was seen as a bid to prevent QAnon from vanishing altogether.The overture to the Elvis conspiracy theorists came after QAnon proposed a similar merger with the National Rifle Association, which declined, citing difficulties of its own."
Jesus yahoo stop deleting my posts. your turning into Twitter. I shorted 1000 shares of Twtr as soon as the news broke. Looking forward to Monday!!!
Twitter finally free!!! !!!
slower growth due to pandemic ..Will they censor Dorsey for lying??
"“This isn't Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It's the United States Congress,"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said in May as he railed against several Democrats who attended a launch after signing a letter saying their absence was due to the public-health crisis.The list of Republicans who wrote letters appointing a proxy include speakers at CPAC on Friday, such as Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Greg Steube, R-Fla.; Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C.; and Ted Budd, R-N.C. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., who is speaking Saturday at the conference, signed onto a lawsuit against proxy voting."
Twitter suspended the Gateway Pundit account on Tuesday for another week for violating the “civic integrity” rules.What the heII is that?
"Taylor-Greene taken off TWTR. I think Boebert is next (if that hasn't happened already). I applaud what TWTR is doing (finally!). It's one thing to allow honest debate; it's quite another to provide a forum for the unscrupulous to knowingly spread falsehoods hoping to incite a takeover of the US government. In the long run, TWTR's moves to preserve democracy will be perceived as good for the company."
It is just a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half.
Puts
Many upgrades for Twitter at $65 dollars target price and TD keeps reaffirming to hold this stock. I will be a believe only if this stock reaches $60 first.
It's reached the point that calling things 'conspiracy theories' are just convenient dismissals the left-use to dismiss uncomfortable truths. The truth is more shocking now than any conspiracy theory out there...
"This just in: twitter to rename itself ""planning and praise app for antifa""."

Twitter - OTC Soon
Bye bye twitter
Do you really think liberal run institutions are going to just watch their profits disappear to make some kind of statement? Risk/Reward always comes first! 
The volume on the March put options with a strike of $20 is increasing. Volume on call options is off the charts. The options are very volatile to the down side for TWTR. People buying this stock long are probably amateurs.
Going too gap down after earnings

This should be treated like I treated the SuperSonics back in ‘96.
"Rousing new coverage on Twitter this morning. A hold with a 45 dollar PT. When @Jack finally gets around to updating WS on what has happened with his baby, the downgrades hammer will fall. This valuation is headed down, down down...."
I would not want to own shares of this right now. Better sell
"lawsuits comings, i think we will see 30 by June"
It's a Sure 100% Bet that TWTR will be in the 30's by Friday. It dropped $2.00 or 4% After Houres on Friday! Expect it to open in the $45.50 and Drop to $39.
Don’t forget to cancel any poster here with the mute button if they support twtr.

"yahoo! finance shows Twitter stock as having:Forward P/E: 58.14Price/Book: 5.33Price/Sales: 11.98Book Value Per Share: 9.86Twitter produces no product. Their revenues are obtained primarily from advertising. With the massive loss of users, how can anyone see this company as a good investment? The only people buying stock in this company are doing so to make a political statement IMHO"

"Great to see local Los Angeles business owners support Project Roomkey. With 50,000 empty hotel rooms in the city and tens of thousands of homeless it’s a pretty amazing opportunity. FEMA will back the funds, it puts the hotels back in business, and the people will have dignity. This isn’t the stuff Elon Musk steps up to do. No money in helping homeless, they can’t use a dog coin."
It’s time for social media corporations to be taught that their users and investors have the final say!
Haha sold! And sold Apple too. Bye bye CCP stocks.

I would be satisfied if each of the RED states would take a stand and prohibit these monopolies from doing business in those states.
"Last warning: jump of big tech stocks including twitter, facebook, amazon, apple right now. They will be charged for treason and hit down bigly."
Incredible that after the O'keefe release where Dorsey says it war on 1/2 the population this is up. Shows you how many sheepelle there are.
"I can't wait to see the TWTR bloodbath on Mon. The stock was already overpriced, and the market is way overdue for a correction, esp. tech stocks. The Twitter employees who urged this censorous action will be paying in their retirment accounts. Karma."

DEMENTIA boy's economy sinking dooooowwwwwnnnnnn
TWTR is a company that makes no profit and hates and censors their customers. It may not be a viable company in a year as it starts to face new competition.
twtr is on the road to mid 60s if lucky!

"Twitter announced today that they acquired Revue, a tiny private company located in the Netherlands that has 6 employees, that's right- 6 employees. It is reasonable to assume that this start-up firm is bleeding red ink and welcomed a buyer before it was forced to declare bankruptcy (remember, the majority of small businesses fail). If Revue is the reason Twitter is up today, it is a ludicrous reaction, and a temporary upward moment as Twitter's negative fundamentals have not changed."
"Cathie Wood and Ark bought a ton of TWTR yesterday and today into earnings. For that sole reason, we will not see red tomorrow Bc she will continue to load up. $65 tomorrow"

FBI Director Wray says over 200 suspects identified in US Capitol riots!They’re coming to take you away HaHaa! They’re coming to take you away!
"Isn’t it remarkable how after the Capitol was attacked Democrats found their moral compasses on criminality. When our businesses were burned & looted throughout the Summer Democrats were silent. When Police were attacked everyday killed and injured they were silent. When BLM injured dozens of Secret Service outside the White House Democrats were silent When the President had to be secured in the WH bunker silence again. They were silent when every statue was pulled down Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln not matter they were silent. The media encouraged violence, with CNN & MSNBC reporting as mobs looted, and fires burning in the background they were peacefully protest. Only when polls started to show their numbers dropping did they in a loud whisper say they were against violence. What happened at the Capitol we all agree was wrong. But how easily a man dressed as a furry and the rest of the rioters made as far as they did must be answered. The Capitol Police were warned, along with the DC Mayor the day before by the FBI. But the Mayor refused to activate the National Guard. Now 21,000 Guard are surrounding DC. Ask yourself why?"
Red is the best color for TWTR

Twitter up today. Jack and the Ayatollah are laughing.
"To the powers that be, @jack the CEO of twitter is purposely throwing away customers. His first obligation, as the CEO of a public company, is to the shareholders. Last time I checked, throwing away customers is not revenue producing.The Board of Directors of Twitter should fire @jack because he has lost his mind."
"Business Insider sees Twitter's weakness. ""In this week's issue of New York Magazine (February 1, 2021), I make the case that Twitter's toxicity and subpar financial results are one and the same problem, amenable to one and the same solution. Fixing Twitter starts at the top — replacing an absentee CEO — and from there, changing the company's business model. The potential rewards are worth it, both economically and socially....All of this — Twitter's weak financial performance and its toxic content — is the result of a broken business model."""
You don't buy shares in a company which has just had $5 Billion wiped out of its value in a single day. Instead you short the shid out of that company...
TWITTER = 330 million users. Subtract the 75 million that will leave....thats a 20% drop in users.
Sell this commie company and any other company that does not support the 1st amendment.

I also expect to see peaceful protests at these companies and the senior leadership soon"
I can't wait to see this plummet on Monday. Going to be one of the best days of my life.

Just cancelled twitter. I see lots of competition coming in and regulations will begin when they see all the conservatives moving to a new platform. I think I’m gonna sell short
Anyone who would invest in a company that eliminates free speech is not an American
maga won. god bless America
You might be a far left liberal if you believed that Dorsey banning the POTUS would be good for the SP...here’s your sign.
Retraced on weak volume; a drop on increase volume is coming before the close.
He lost 70 million users. Why Jack D. left the US? Wait for the report.
Continue shorting this non profit making company who has targeted censorship!
"Sue Jack, Save Freedom.""In recent days I’ve been made aware of dozens of conversations by former Twitter users that thousands of people might not only be eligible to sue #BigTweet but expect a bit of a payday in doing so.Beginning the day following the January 6th activities in Washington, DC, Jack Dorsey got aggressive, hostile, and intentional in the mishandling of his enterprise.The argument that Twitter—as a private company—can do what they wish with impunity is holding less water as the scope of the malfeasance is coming to light.By estimates from my own observation and discussion with others, Dorsey intentionally maligned the welfare of his company. In most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecond.His actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld. Given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of Twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectations.And last week Jack Dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath. He did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation. His actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to $7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product: an audience.So there are plenty of reasons shareholders, the public, and former Twitter users should consider legal recourse."""

"Hey Dorsey, about that $10 Million of share-holders money you gave to Black Lives Matter? So what did they do with it? Who has it now?"
I will do my best to get everyone I know to delete their Twitter accounts.
"This is the first time ever that I'm glad shorties, shorting a stock making huge bucks."
"Twitter censors people and ideas, and this is a problem"
Twitter. $2.00.
So many People on various social media sites announced they have deleted TWTR. This is not going to show up on TWTR's financials for another 2 quarter.
"The media all assiduously assure us in article after article that there were no Antifa or BLM in the Capitol riot. And yet, the New York Post and Epoch Times have actually researched and there were at least 2 individuals in this category, and there is footage of them encouraging wrongdoing. Why are all the major media outlets continuing to lie to us on this issue, small though it is? Is it because they have supported the political unrest for the last 4 years with their support for lawlessness, barraging us continually with claims that someone is lying when that person has presented their opinion on an issue, but otherwise suppressing news that has more substance than a gossip page?"
Dorsey and company throwing cash at the the problem... Short!!!
better get out tomorrow........
Any American company that is against free speech should drummed out of America and your stock should be worth no more than 2 cents a share. Next up is Amazon and Google. I have reduced all my business dealings with them as of today and will have all associates follow. Remember 75 million customers don't agree with the Socialist Communist agenda the Democrats are putting into effect.
I am selling all my Twitter and Facebook stock. I have made a lot of money but they will soon fail.

"Don't forget that while Twitter was declaring a loss of over $7 Million in QE2 2020, they were busy handing $10 Million away to BLM. The SEC should drag them over the coals just for tha, because basically by handing away the shareholders money, drove the company into making a loss."
EVERYONE Celebrating yet???
That’s a nice double top on the 6m & 1m chart￼. But I’m sure that doesn’t mean anything LOL￼.

"Forget shorting Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Those companies are not nearly as vulnerable to business drop as Twitter is. They will do their own thing tomorrow, but Twitter will be dying like there is no tomorrow."
I can't believe this is happening in America. I dumped Twitter and Facebook this morning.
"The idea at Twitter, one would imagine, is to GAIN users, along with monetizing active ones. What we are seeing unfold before our eyes, is a massive user exit. It reminds me of my AOL stock owning days (I’m showing my age). So many people could not come to grips, including myself, of the massive amount of people that were leaving to find something better.Once stock holders figured it out......"
twitter reaching to $100's mile per hour
"Without knowing anything about the company, a person should sell their stocks of Dorsey's companies based solely on his current appearance."
Good opportunity for insiders to line up for the exits!
Twitter is a liberal portfolio in a nut-shell...No wonder they are always seeking government assistance. Such poor life choices...

Something Is Not Adding Up! Cathie Wood Had Invested In TSLA and WKHS! Both Fell The Week After! Now She Has Invested In TWTR and PLTR! Will They Both Fall Also?!?! Are They Shorting Their Own Stock?!?! Is Another Group Trying To Sabotaging Her?!?! Just Something That Crossed My Mind! Our Beautiful Bird Is Still Over Sold!

In a 24 hour period solar is useless almost half the time....how many cloudy day? your gues is as good as mine. the real ESTATE they sit on is too expansive for the little it produces....NUCLEAR IS THE CLEANEST...period.
They’re trying to prop this up and it’s obvious
A very large sign to a professional trader that a company is going down is that I’m able to flip it consistently for a profit. Also one must add the concept that many big tech are leaving California wit informed decisions while Dorsey conducts his business from a private island. The warning signs are all here for long term investors. Day traders like myself however are enjoying it very much. I highly recommend not investing in Twitter long term.
yum....i love being white.....yes sir

Oh no. 50% of America shutting accounts off.
"Hey, I'm no liberal but I like making money. Twitter looks good."
apparently companies don't care about stock value. and more about politics. This should be grounds for delisting if they do not work as exclusively to be more profitable and grow. NOT minimize growth.

We must use the same political weapons that is being used by the Left. Immediately, contact your House Representative to get the impeachment ball rolling.

"I would suggest using G A B and d issenter the free speech browser there are some fringe elements but most people are using them because they are truly concerned about repression of free speech in the United States. The best thing about D issenter is you can add your own comments to any webpage without Orwellian like censorship. Also, try bizfluence an alternative to LinkedIn. TWTR is on the decline, without diversity of opinion you simply don't have democracy, people are voting with their feet."
Goodbye TWTR! Poooof!
"There's short-term downward pressure, but their most likely competition just got knee-capped by Amazon AWS dropping them for their participation in the recent insurrection. Eventually, people will move on."
so everything crashed like 5-10% today and this stock went up. i hate the stock market im done im selling everything why the hell should any retail investor bother at this point??
"This is the biggest piece of k-rap earnings transcript I have ever read. The future DOES NOT look very bright. Here is the brokerage house collusion again to pump. Unreal.

Massive exodus coming soon when advertisers pull $$ from shrinking revs...feathers will be flying from this beat-up bird.
cancel culture stocks in trouble tomorrow
queue the class-action suits
Darn futures under pressure again this morning. We need what happened to $TWLO yesterday. Down more than 4.5% intraday then up more than 10% after ER. I suppose it could go either way with this strange market that still punishes solid top line and bottom line beat like $NOK and $AKAM. Seems like a beat is no longer sufficient and you have to be in favor like $SNAP and $TWTR to be treated properly after ER these days. I hope the revenue and earnings beat is sufficient to warrant such favortism today.
Twitter CEO looks and acts like a socialist.

Faang stocks taking a beating and is going to get worse. Twitter is going to the basement.
Pricing power is on twitters side
Time to start a CLASS ACTION. You longs should be sueing Dorsey and Twitter. He did not show due diligence and caused you to lose money.
Section 230!!!!!
Gravity is a funny thing.
this stock is headed to 20 a share.
The best way to “teach” a company is through consumer and shareholder’s decisions. Twitter is learning the lesson.
Twitter lost $10 Billion in one week. Just think you could run some African countries for a year with that kind of money.
"Congrats to anyone hold Twitter for more than 5 years. You just let your money sitting in dust. Do you know Twitter stock price still have not recover since 6 years ago at 63 dollars? Without dividend or any compensation, at least you would have make 10% by leaving your money in saving account ahahah. Also I would want to see how Twitter can keep it up now Trump is gone and election is gone. Better sell now or wait for another 5 years to get your money back"
"Twitter will retrace, as its negative fundamentals remain: negative earnings, no dividend, loss of half its users, growth of competitors, and child sex abuse law suits."
"Twits Tweet and our outgoing Emperor Tweeted a lot. Bigly. Believe me. Hey, at least Mexico paid for the wall, the promised taxes were released and we got our ""repealed and replaced on Day One"" healthcareMAGA - Mexico Ain't Gonna Ante-up?"

"I just deleted my Twitter account, because I don't support oppression"
can someone explain this in layman's terms? Seems lie the overall market and this has cased us to sink.Twitter stock pulls back from record after the pricing of $1.25 billion in convertible debt. Why does a company do this? to raise money. I'm clueless .. sorry. Please no political b.s.. just trying to understand
We are twitter and open to free speech....As long as you say what we tell you to say. We can talk about shooting the president but you can't..We are scared of competition also and had our budding Bozo at AWS help usTwitButt
I am looking to reach 65 to 68 in my short!
ill never regret this investment especially in the longrun :)
Users are hemorrhaging. I have 2 locked accounts that prevent me from accessing 'settings' to deactivate them. This artificially inflates the number of actual active users.
man all the nah sayers got burned twice
Deleted my Twitter account last night!! Went to Parler.Will delete my Facebook once established on a new site.
Comrad Stalin would have loved Twitter
"Twitter CEO is sued, India is soon going to ban twitter, twitter is going all on subscription where people have to pay to use it. I don’t know what is the reason twitter is pumping everyday. Hope it don’t crash like Workhorse!!"
what's the dividend on twitter?
LOOK OUT BELOW!! This is what Jack deserves. His board should can him over this.
"Blue lives matter!! Unless its Capital blue lives. You can then gouge eyes, hit with hockey sticks and fire extinguishers."
I expect Twitter will go down in history as the worst company in the world
Class action lawsuits coming.

Jacks secret recording tape is out. Hurry before You Tube takes it out!

We are short selling this today and laughing all the way to the bank!
"Across the board, the financial establishment has reacted with outrage to the surge in what previously were considered dead stocks. Industry insiders have taken to TV to decry the amateur investors, hedge fund billionaires have demanded the government intervene on their behalf, and investment firms have bailed out their short-selling colleagues who lost tens of billions of dollars when the stocks rose, instead of falling as they predicted."

"I predict this. Twitter will continue to fall. Next month they'll have fallen so much they'll do a reverse split. Then slowly sink from there into bankruptcy. Twitter is finished. Half the users are gone, the advertisers won't like that. Revenues will plummet."

"Wow, when it will hit 75?"
How long will Dorsey’s jurk off investors keep pumping money into this disaster?
We need to bring this to 0 twitter is not the bearer of free speech
Twitter trying to launch. 
Twitter is the most damaging company to the humans in history. It’s basically controlled speech. It’s basically china.
I hope this stock keeps falling 
"Why is it that democrat run cities have the highest murder rates, highest rape rates, highest assault and armed robbery rates?"
Nice to see the TWTR board evolving into a communication method for patriots. Please share this and let's send TWTR reeling to the single digits (where this turd belongs). Short at will. Eff ewe Jack.
TWTR is poised to go above $75.00 IA
"I sure enjoy watching this conitinue to drop, we would like to see it drop faster, millions of us. One thing is for sure, the actions to censor the American Patriots IS going to lead to competition. As soon as #45GOAT announces his suppprt for a platform, thats when this #$%$ crashes."
"7+ years since going public. Still in same position.Current analysts targets below the present share price.And shareholders tolerate a part time destructive CEO, that has cashed out the majority of his holdings long ago.His wealth is tied up in his full time CEO duties with $SQ Square seems to be doing quite well where Jack Dorsey’s wealth is and TWTR shareholders continue to get bent over.Take your frustrations out on SQ. Hit deranged Jack where it hurts."
In a few weeks the survivors will be saying this.....
"Let's play the ""Price is Right"" game show shall we... Bob Barker, I say uh...$250/sh ...no, lower ...uh, $225 no lower, oh geez uh, how about $195/sh Bob? NO LOWER, okay Bob, how about $125 Bob? no! okay, let's go to $95, how about that Bob? ...well, I'm sorry were out of time, please come back and join us for the Price is Right, see ya'll next time! ...$TWTR"
Even with a 60$ pt this trash almost closes red. Would get out before earnings as this will be a freefall due to poor guidance going forward
TWTR @ $56 = shareholders R.I.P.
The censorship lead ballon is dragging Jack and his “book burners” down! Sell before it’s too late!
"if users are deleting there accounts like these post say when they reports numbers that's when twtr takes it's biggest drop until then down , up , down"
Selling begets more selling.
Going to $30 in near future
goodbye Twitter. Tank. you won't be missed
over 60% sell to buy ratio pm
Sell sell
Hundreds of companies sell web services worldwide. Parler CEO is not very smart to sue Amazon while his entire website is shutdown and he isn't making any money while it is shut down. Worst case he can buy the web services from a chinese company if all they American companies wont sell web services to him to shutdown conservative speech.
"You know it’s bad when Merkel and the EU is bashing Twitter and US Big Tech, which are nothing but propaganda arms of the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party has succeeded in turning the US into a BANANA REPUBLIC!"
Higher Lows and Higher Highs! Our Beautiful Bird Loves To Soar! This Is One Red Hot Chick;)
Amazon now has joined the censorship sweeping America by cutting off their servers to Parler effective at midnight. Conspiracy theories need no further introduction as Big Tech hasshown they the true conspirators trying to destroy America.
"This is interesting the support is clumped together, according to 'Barchart'. YF doesn't allow me to post the link. BUT the point is if this dips under 43.65, there is no support below. I strongly believe this will dip under 44 when the market opens...Pivot Point 1st Support Point 44.77 Pivot Point 2nd Support Point 44.37 Pivot Point 3rd Support Point 43.65"
"Have you had enough yet? No coincidence it underperformed the market again. The company destroyed itself, with no regard for the shareholders, just the selfishness and loathing driven by Jack Dorsey part time CEO, has no significant financial stake in this either.What does he care?But he does care about $SQ where he has his wealth and is also CEO.Maybe SQ should be treated the way Dorsey treated TWTR shareholders, which was with no regard."
"The next base of support for TWTR is at $24, the price that Elliot Management and Silver Lake bought it for last March. The question is whether or not Elliot Management and Silver Lake want to sell their stake or if they want to make organization changes in upper management. The political animus within TWTR's rank and file employees in hurting their ability to reverse their losses on the balance sheet."
"Most likely the protestors setting up at the capitols would do their thing and go home. But when leftest groups show up and if there’s fighting, the media will say look at those republicans."
What you think above average volume plus red 10x what the market moved today is implies?
JD just wiped out 10% of TWTR profit!! and that is only Trumps account. Other prominent people are leaving Twitter now.
"Oath Keepers lost their twitter accounts. Head nut, Thomas Caldwell, is in front of a Judge today. And no, he can't carry his AR-15 in Court. He's looking at 20 years. Doesn't look good for the O.K.'s long term employment in the free world."
This stock has been on fire ever since Trump got axed. Hee-Hawley the insurrectionist got lit up in tweets today.

BLM burned down buildings looted store and caused millions and millions of dollars worth of damage. Twitter says nothing.
I want to thank Jack for making all shorts rich......
Thanks to the Pedo in Chief we can make a fortune shorting the Market the next 4 years. Twitter is just the beginning
Earnings must be something extra
"I canceled twtr, closed amazon and migrating from gmail now. It took me a few hours to cancel all of my amazon subscribe and save items. Last night I made my first online purchase I would have normally made using prime. I landed on Ace hardware for what I needed. It will be a little work to establish alternatives, but after a few months I should have new accounts setup to make shopping online as easy as it was with prime."
My estimate is that Twitter have lost $7.5 Billion since Monday.
Bagholders be like:
Stay short. Will not hit 20 in a straight line until after earnings
How is this reckless company not in the 30s yet?
"I think TWTR is going to be hit the worst from deactivations, more so than FB and AMZN. Nothing of personal significance is lost by deactivating TWTR; FB is most likely where families and friends stay in touch, and AMZN is AMZN (though I've long started to diversify my online purchases, anyway). I think FB could see more Instagram account cancellation."
Soon Simon & Garfunkel Law Firm will file Class Action Lawsuits against Twtr for censorship N violations of freedom of speech....so sign up when u get it in ur email...
Deleted all of my social network accounts.
On the bright side if twitter can gain another 56 cents they'll reach their one year price forecast average:)
facebook in big trouble - zuck rigged the election - don't mess with free speech - FB will never recover.FB $TWTR $AMZN $GOOG
Block CNN MSNBC. NBC etc from your phone. I blocked all of them. I do not want any fake news from them
Hope Dorsey is forced to step down soon
Twitter and Facebook are selling your personal information to third-parties and even to bad actors outside the USA. That's why your id is being stolen people. They've been caught in the act.
I will never own twitter stock and deleted/uninstalled their #$%$ app a year ago.
Even a former Obama adviser agrees Twitter is the problem.
BLM are very angry to hear Dorsey won't be able to hand them another $10 Million Dollars in 2021...
Just deleted the App from my phone as well. Felt really good. Wish I could have done that 20x.
"The user who goes by the name “Stephen”, he is a winner lmao. Look at his posts, and do EXACTLY the opposite of what he predicts! He’s been saying Twitter will crash close to a year now! I bought as much as I possibly could since the price fell to $30... I’ve made $200k just in 2021 alone so far doing the exact opposite of a genius prophet like “Stephen” The brother hasn’t figured this out yet, he does what he predicts. But as long as you do the opposite of what he predicts, you will make money. Nobody tell him "
"The Truth. Once one person’s voice is taken away, even if you don’t agree with their speech, it is then only a matter of time until your voice is silenced as well."

Sell Twitter! oryour money!
"Once again, no worries, as Twitter is up slightly on very weak volume (less than 50% of its 10 day average}.The next big volume day is fast approaching, and when it comes it will send TWTR into a severe downward spiral."

"Harrison Smith on American Journal Infowars, just claimed that something big is going down today. He claims a military source has told him to expect something big today."
this company deserves to be Cancelled!!!
Class action lawsuits coming = Price SOUTH
bad news ahead. And personallyi hope twitter fails after what they did to the first amendment. canceled my personal twitter account and shorted the stock. dorsey i hope your empire burns to the ground.
This stock will be $20 by March.
"Just today, you've seen Gen. Austin announce that the Pentagon is shifting its priorities to carry out war against ""climate change."" This treasonous act would de-prioritize America's national defense and instead focus the entire US military on an imaginary enemy that's nothing but a quack science hoax."
what time is earnings?
Dead cat bounce. Earnings disaster on Feb 9th....collapse into heap ensues.
What does Dorsey do after Twitter goes under? maybe work as a barista?
"If you own this stock, you have no morals, and you make George Orwell cry."
Defund BLM
the destruction may not show up in this quarters numbers but they will next quarter.... and the stock will crash
"Nothing ever positive coming from this company, just negativity."
Dont forget the 10% for the big guy.

Let's talk about the basic principle of Democracy The right to choose.In essence walk away from media tyrants...exercise your freedom from this thought tyrany.. express your self and do the right thing.
Tank tomorrow
Comments being Censored
Ouch! Down 2.5% and the trends look bad. Could it be because of Parler?
Saddened that people still buy these social media stocks.
The left broke the backbone of America. Can we count on them to defend us if our country gets invaded? Maybe they’ll tweet for help but who’s there to listen?
Loving my shorts..
"This will trade below $40 by end of week, $30 or less by March, $20 or less by June."
January 14th: “Dorsey: 'This Is Going to be Much Bigger Than Just One Account”. Run awayyyyy!
"funny, Twitter is telling me that there was an error and I can't deactivate my account until further notice.... I see they're still up to their shenanigans"
This would be a great short!
"I deleted my twitter account a week ago 40k followers. I only had 100 shares, sold that as well a week ago. I’m glad I did."
"So Twitter can decide, which president of America can vote? Twitter will likely be shut down by the U.S. Gov't eventually... Remember Hittler..."
"Facebook, Twitter are titanic MONOPOLIES with BILLIONS OF DOLLARS of PROFITS (DISPOSABLE INCOME) that State goverments and the US government need. Democrats can create a new social networking tax that starts at 20% and increases up to 90% for the social networking companies that are monopolies like FB and Twitter . The billions in taxes the state and local goverments collect will do alot of good for the people."
No people need TWTR but TWTR needs people. When you leave it you will find that you don't need it to live.
"Obvious warning: If $TWTR finished at the low of the day or a hair different, watch out for Thursday and ESPECIALLY FRIDAY EOD. It could be multiple dollars ugly."
Twitter will break records!!!Of the longest consecutive losing streak in the markets!
Election is over & best customer TWTR ever had is deleted--KMA.
"America is also freedom of choice. America you have a choice. I am a Finance guy, but have a minor in law. I was reading about legal challenges TWIT may face. It will be tough, they are a private company. Some one could challenge them and focus on their ""consistency of applying their own policies"". That may have a leg to stand on. Arbitrary deleting and suspending accounts?? If they did it to president because of violence threat OK although I may not agree OK. BUT, letting Iran keep up its post on killing americans (and yahoo police its a fact go look at it) is opening them up for legal challenges. The way to get back at TWIT is to delete your accounts. That's FREEDOM OF CHOICE. DONT USE THEIR SERVICE. That is the most powerful action Americans can take that don't agree. its very simple. Advertisers want return for their $$$. They will drop TWITTER or ask for reduced rates. Twitter earnings will suffer. Stock price will tank. Good luck"
Class action lawsuits please. They have not done what's in the best interest of their shareholders.
"World exodus of big tech on the move!!! I Pray they loose so much money, they have come and live with the other 80% of the population!!!"
"Sell Twitter, Apple, Facebook and Google"
Too many puts bought today. Have to short the stock folks. Short it and buy puts but just dont buy puts.
Thank you Joe! We FINALLY have a president who will look out for the working class Americans. You non working Trumper’s will have to mooch off someone else.
Twatter had this coming for months. Sure glad Dorkey stepped up his game the last few weeks by taking his mask off to reveal the CCP-sponsored censorship. Making money is too easy on the backs of these Demonrat sympathizers.
Dont let jack dorsey control peoples speech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"""Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one’s thought and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They know its power.

Send in the Social Workers this stock is getting murdered...
Remember that moment when Myspace went from hip to outdated? This is happening to Twitter on Monday.
"2015 ""Twitter supports free speech"". Fact check: FALSE"
"Last trade size 0, something fishy about that."
"Support is about 45, take that out and there is no stopping this thing from utter collapse."
No free speech for you Mr. John Q. American! So says Xi Jingping and his right hand man Jack. Sell.
Deactivated my twitter account. I find it comical that when you click deactivate the only message you get is: Sorry to see you go. #GoodByeWho knows what will happen to the stock. I sold my mere 400 shares in my retirement account Friday. I'm out because I cannot be a part of a company that is clearly attacking our rights.
Heavy selling on Monday over action reaction. This is not going to end well for Twitter.
I think maybe there should be a lawsuit from the shareholders against the company...... for not disclosing to the shareholders what they were going to do
Sold 5000 shares
you thought this stock was losing money before....yikes..
It might be a big storm coming
This is probably the best short in the entire market right now.
This was upgraded. CNBC said to buy. Why is it going down?
Looks like it's more than just 80 million people leaving the platform. Other countries are already banning it and more are planning on banning the app in the future. This is a global wipeout of the company.
We are all leaving or have left Twitter. Could someone shut the lights out on their way out.
"Twitter basher should just go & do something productive to better their own self,,, Twitter to a $100s level anytime soon. Hi Brenda!"
"How did Twitter's stock price ascend to where it is today considering the facts it has a negative P/E ratio, and does not pay a dividend? The answer is large revenue growth projections. Recent actions made by the CEO have greatly diminished Twitter's ability to grow their revenue in the foreseeable future, coupled this with the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab, looming class action lawsuits from disgruntled stockholders, and the recent revelation of its association with child sex abuse, the big players on Wall Street are going to give Twitter's stock price a crew cut in the not to distance future."
if twitter wasnt actually worried about other platforms like parler and Gab then it wouldnt be working so hard to take down parler etc. The fact is theyre very worried and their next earnings will show that. Numbers wont lie.
"Protest at Twitters corporate headquarters tomorrow.....I Big Turnout expected,,,,1900 SF police put on high alert. Jack Dorsey...you cannot hide behind your beard,,,,"
Impeach Jack DorseyShut down twitter
Signed up for Parler earlier tonight and just deleted Twitter.
I’m just here for my weekly cameo to say what’s up to all the 45 Fanboys! Happy shorting!

"In a surprising move Giuliani has now been moved to the post of “Mass Transit Vehicle Undercarriage Inspector” and never knew the Turnip, worked for a very short time and in a very limited role. Bigly. Believe me.MAGA - Making Attorneys Get Attorneys"
Unsuspecting Americans are being forced to invest in this commie company as the company is in the S & P 500. Get your 401k out of that fund and any other fund that doesn't have twtr or other commie companies.
Cult45 is going to have a very bad week.

This will be the mother of all short plays come Monday morning.
There goes Joe's China payoff investment
"Jack with the nose ring completely forgot that he is getting purged by purging users. Nobody needs twitter, twitter needs everybody"
MAGA impeached TWTR and the market has now convicted TWTR. Shorts will now feed off the carcass. Sad some longs were just caught in the middle.
Ouch! Now down 5% and dropping. Rumor is that millions of accounts have moved to Parler.
Dropping 1 dollar from here and this thing is in freefall. How low it will drop is anyone's guess...
$18 tomorrow.
So how much do you think it will be tomorrow? -10%? -20% -30%?
"TWTR to be halted at the open. The whales will be allowed to sell their positions at a small, insignificant loss. You, on the other hand, are trapped and will get creamed when trading resumes. "
Always bet against the enemies of freedom. It is your duty not to support them.
Twitter and FB will never recover loving their flounder. Little Jack will soon be on the outs. Share holders lost big time!
"In the land of crazy, your CEO would make it illegal to sell your shares soon, and call it domestic terrorism. It's not too far fetched when your CEO seems to be taking opioids, look at his pupils. Oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl are commonly misused drugs that have the effect of causing pupils to constrict."
"Man, those shorters and boycotters are just doing a number on this stock much alike the destruction they caused to Nike. On another note, Peter Navarro (a Turnip-worshiper) now claims that 'old Billy Barr was part of the Deep State coup against the Mango Mussolini. I know, I know.....I saw it on Faux News and it's an alternative fact but as soon as the story is backed up by the National Enquirer, you know it's the truth........"
Bad news coming on Twitter. Heard it here first
Maybe a protest where big tech is sold is in order.. Like Apple Stores.. Kamala.. you gots some dough for a bail fund?
Where's Hunter?
Should be a class action lawsuits against the CEOs and a DOJ investigation into collusion. A warrant should go out now for all of their emails and phone calls
"First Amendment Rights. The First Amendment protects the freedom to peacefully assemble or gather together or associate with a group of people for social, economic, political purposes. The Washington Monument was the historical place of the ""I have a Dream Speech"" of Martin Luther King"" and the Socialist left wanted to suppress the BLM movement in there largest year of protest ever from celebrating at the Washington Monument this year. The Socialist are banning the Freedoms of all Americans."
That was short lived. Down she goes...
Conservatives just CANCLE Twitter and short it !Enjoy some liberals cash
Sold on Friday!
Big boys keep shorting TWTR @48 of you pay attn....
"Will Rudy Giuliani represent the 'My Pillow"" dude while defending himself against the defamation lawsuit? Will David Dennison or John Barron start a GoFundMe page for Rudy?

"Twatter is just completing the chart formation of a classic head and shoulders move, once that right shoulder is formed it will tank massively"
"Uh oh, Parler's back. Twitter faces headwinds in the market for spite, bitterness and bile."
We have 25 THOUSAND National Guard troops in DC to protect Americans from Republicans! Think about that for awhile. 
"Uh David? Do you think that in the future you could combine 5 or 6 posts into one post so that it doesn't look like the ""David"" board? Thanks in advance for your understanding and cooperation."
Nothing satisfies me more than the falling price of TWTR.
Freeeeeee money! Haha no risk shorting this. Numbers are numbers you can?t hide what you don?t have. Let?s see Twitter #$%$ their way out of this!
2nd shortsqueeze lol
"Earlier in the day, Robinhood banned the buying of $GME, $AMC, $BB and $NOK (GameStop, AMC Theaters, Blackberry and Nokia) stocks, after small-time traders snapped them up, inflated their value, and got rich while inflicting devastating losses on Wall Street hedge funds, who had gambled a fortune on these companies’ decline."

"""Our job is to prepare for global revolution and reset."" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to his employees"

"Everyone realizes we are no different that people fighting for kings and their lands 500 years ago. When it is all over the masses get nothing.The kings get the land and riches and we slay each other for nothing.Right or Left, Censorship is not going to help this country.Clearly there are people of common sense on both sides, yet we let the 10% of extremists on the left and the 10% extremists on the right, fire us up.When that stops our country will be what it should be. Turn off the media, that will help."
Facebook and Twitter have lost a combined $51 billion in market cap following their bans of President
can't wait for the State of the Union speak from China Joe . All 4 minutes of it YOU KNOW THE THING
All the Fake News organizations that knowingly and falsely claimed that the Hunter laptop Story was 'Russian Disinformation' still have active Twitter accounts after posting those lies
"We don't need twtr or fb, save time for something else"
"Americans, never forget what Dorsey has done. Not ever."
"Does yahoo, aol and twitter pay their anti first amendment censors $15.00 an hour and give them healthcare."
"Under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek and receive news and express opinions. These 10 countries flout the international standard by banning or severely restricting independent media and intimidating journalists into silence with imprisonment, digital and physical surveillance, and other forms of harassment. Self-censorship is pervasive. 1 Eritrea 2 North Korea 3 Turkmenistan 4 Saudi Arabia 5 China 6 Vietnam 7 Iran 8 Equatorial Guinea 9 Belarus 10 Cuba"
"Nice move for your shareholders, Jack! What were you smoking??"
"in 6 days the circus comes to town , there will be no bulls only bears"
Countries like India are also assessing the possibility of Banning twitter. India has 30% of twitter base. So I think this will sink to 10 or less
Worst S&P 500 Performer so far YTD... That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.... out of 500 stocks not 30.... 500
"buy, buy, buy, come on, $77"
For at least 10 years now the Major Media outlets have been repeating talking points in sync over and over again .... If you've noticed back then it was quite creepy to realize how the media has been corrupted to the bone.. The Media truly is the enemy of the American People and more and more need to call them out for their #$%$. The Protests need to be aimed at the media and their employees..
The market is now an illusion. Propped up because those who control don't want it collapsing on their watch. Wait...wait....wait...and see what happens! Just saw a tape from a witness to the fact that Rosenstein created a dirty crimes division with......Shawn Henry.....Crowdstrike. So many horrific individuals tied to companies in the US.
Parler will be up & running on Monday morning. Expect Twitter to fall all week.
I Have a Special Request! Can We All Please Stop With The Political Stuff! Please With Sugar On Top!
"American Horror Story’ Star Leslie Grossman Wishes She Assaulted Rand Paul, Twitter Does Nothing"
"While I do not agree people will be deleting Twitter, I have seen the number of pickups on phones have dropped by over 90% a day since I stopped checking all day what Trump was tweeting about. If even a small percentage of the user base is also checking this much less, I can only presume forecasted projections will be dismal this next earnings call."
Rush said he deactivated his Twitter account. He has 88.6 million followers. Good for him.
Social media and media in general are distractions made for procrastination. Dump them all and you won't miss them after a few weeks of detoxing. You may just find time to connect with family and friends at a human level instead of fighting like animals or showing off like the thugs
Sell on this dead cat pre market bounce.
Delete your Twitter account!
Divide and conquer the dems motto Freedom of speech is a right and should not be controlled by the left.Twitter has decided to divide and fuel the fire it will not end good for Twitter or it’s stock holders. Very bad decision on Twitters part.
Twatter to zero
Fire Jack Dorksey and the stock rallies 20 dollars in 5 minutes.
Lol did retail Robin hoody’s just get out of school?
Dead bird falling
Bidding it up so the 25% routing its about to get doesnt seem as bad.

"The market is up today supposedly because weekly unemployment claims were not off-the-wall terrible , just terrible. These new claims are historically high when compared to pre-covid levels. Sounds like really ""good news"" to me. It is reasonable to expect retraction later today, when an objective understanding of this new data emerges. Twitter owners have been given a temporary gift to sell at a profit."
Deactivated my account this morning. Adios!

Gab>TWTR
"My Twitter account is frozen because I am a conservative. Millions are also frozen.Twitter will not allow any of us to close our accounts. We all moved to GAB and other platforms yet Twitter keeps our frozen accounts 'open' (although we cannot tweet, comment, change our profile or even cancel our account) to make it appear they still have that many active users.They are faking the amount of users by holding these petrified account as 'open.The company is a fraud and the stock price will plummet far further once the true number of lost users is revealed.Sell."
FACEBOOK IS TANKING - IT WILL NEVER RECOVER!!!!FB $AAPL $AMZN $TWTR $GOOG
"Democrats despised Twitter for being Trumps social media of choice and now Twitter just alienated every conservative known to man with its attack against free speech. So with Twitter already losing money and now no subscribers, what exactly is there to prop this stock up? Earnings report showing loss of subscribers I'm sure will go over well doh."
Twtr lost a cool 5 bil bucks of its market value just 2day.
This stock is really moving DOWN $10.00 in a month. By the end of February should be down another $20.00
George Soros is a huge fan and overweight investor in his Twiddle.
Twitter and it's future...
"Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO: “We are focused on one account [@realDonaldTrump] right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account, and it’s going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week, and the next few weeks, and go on beyond the inauguration.”Twitter is a sinking ship."
The fight is between good and (evil-Twitter).
"In one week the big guy eliminated 11,000 pipeline jobs, rejoined the Paris accord costing Americans billions, caused gasoline to spike 50cents a gallon and promised to raise corporate and income taxes......It's going to be a long painful expensive 4 years..."
Will Twitter block the thousands of leftists planning to show up at state capitals to fight?
It was the pillow guy that was dragging us!!! Let's block more orange people please!!!!
"SP has fallen nearly 15% since Jan 6th. Investors take note of the high forward P/E, high price/sale, high price/book and low book value. No dividends. What is it that appeals to those who are investing their hard earned money in this company? The stock price will continue to decrease."
Liberals actually think Dorsey cares about them! 
Gain or loose money I’m shorting Twitter on principle
I smell the stench of panic here.....or is that Jack's beard.
I'm selling my TWTR.... I don't believe in what they now stand for. Not right that they took away our President's right to free speech. Freedom of Speech...
BYE BYE ANTI AMERICAN TWEEKER. TIMBER!
"Those McCoys in Georgia! After spending 15 minutes spreading untruths, GQP teacher Susan McCoy learned her kids are smarter than she is. They recorded her spreading lies. And now she’s in real hot water. As with all CONS, she’s amazing apologetic after being caught in video. I’m sure she is. No amount of tweets will fix it. Tweet lady tweet. They never are when the cameras aren’t rolling, but as all GQP Cons are learning : THE CAMERAS are always rolling. And we have 5 years of them on video. And now we are locking them up. LOCK HER UP. Spreading purposeful disinformation to a child should be a felony for every offense. Every time. Every occasion. And the result should be loss of license and censure, public shaming, and for the most egregious cases, public execution. If the right white are going to practice their Saudi charia here to punish the citizenry, our LISTS will find them All. I won’t be part of the chabad infiltration"
Anybody has an idea technically how deep this could fall? $220-$230 short term possible? Looks like downwards pressure is building for $FB en $TWTR Tia

It was higher than this yesterday
This should be shorted into the ground!!

"TWTR likes that 900,000 people lost their jobs, it has always been behind people not having good but very bad."
A Military Coup has happened. Washington has soldiers encamped even out in the suburbs. The Democrats are now the Communist Party.
Twitter has continued censoring/banning accounts with opposing viewpoints. Why would anyone support/vote for this? Why would anyone think this is a good investment for their hard-earned money? This has to end. Let your money speak. Cancel Twitter.
If you haven't deactivated your account yet to support free speech do it!Watch the free market destroy TWTR for violating its own tenantsI have shorted since Friday and will stay short to see the efforts of the people come to fruition
"Can all the people who cancelled their $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts, cancel their Yahoo account too. Thanks!"
"I’ve done tech longer than bat kid has demanded attention. Nobody measures accounts. Nobody counts accounts. Hotmail doesn’t count how many registered of half registered or verified or unverified accounts it has and Microsoft doesn’t report that number. The numbers they do care about are Activity, page views, retweets, ad views, ad clicks. And looking at the group on 1/6? Not only are they freeloaders, they never click on Twitter ads, and never buy anything advertised. That’s why it’s 0 value keeping them and their impressions and their risky activities. Getting a sweet jasmine or mypillowbiter ad over at defunct GRUparler wasn’t so special."
"These platforms are destroying democracies around the world. If they are not stopped, the world as we know it will come to an end!"
"if you don't conform to what $FB or TWTR want you to say, you will be banned... The Democratic party is no longer the great JFK Democratic party... sad days ahead for freedom of speech. Capitulate, or lose your freedom of speech."
Wha it until Section 230 gets repealed and this thing will really tank.
I was one day late when i said 53
Leave your politics at home Twitter. Censorship is not good.
Another nice day for twtr! Jack Dorsey for man of the year!!
"When you have a platform that kicks off the conservative voices of your choice, how is this going to help stockholders and is Jack Dorsey simply ignoring the 2nd amendment? The answer is 100% yes and why I am shorting Twitter. If you are in this stock, Monday is not going to be fun!"
Dead cat bounce. This will end the day in the red...
Twitters controlled by a bin laden. Twitter is the most damaging company to society.
Twitter offends half of the USA and their stock price goes up. This making money off stocks is a very confusing proposition.
Twitter trending to 80.00 this week. for those who sold in January snooze you lose for those who didn't sell a lot more wealthier. you the man Dorsey
"Wonder how long before the class action lawsuits start? Thanks Jack, off!"
"This is against logic. Yesterday earnings are no better than the previous ones where each time, it was dropping 20-30%. And this time should be the same. Otherwise it is manipulation."
BLM rioted and looted for months while the media claimed they were peaceful protesters. Now a one day protest about possible election fraud is the worst thing ever. Some pushing and few punches nothing set fire the only person harmed was a unarmed young white woman who was murdered by security forces. The media has already buried this story. No charges have been laid against the officer. She was not the right color or political affiliation for her life to matter. The communists have won.

meanwhile back at Twitter HQ jack is storming up new ideas
"Wow, TWTR has fallen 20 percent in the last month, as the DOW skyrockets.The CEO should be fired for breach of fiduciary responsility to stockholders, i.e, censhorship for personal political reasons."
I want Jimmy Carter back. At least no cell phones or social media will be involved. Just free toasters at your local bank to open a checking account at 20% interest rates.

"Any day now Tucker Carlson will find the duplicate of the evidence that he ""lost in the mail"" the same night that his dog ate his homework and Rudy Giuliani will release the evidence gleaned from his most recent Lev Parnas-sponsored Ukraine Walkabout 2.0.After coming off dozens and dozens of successful lawsuits, Rudy Giuliani is about to drop the bigly hammer on Dominion with his explosive, blockbuster evidence (which he's given to Tucker Carlson for safekeeping).In the meantime, I would urge the faithful to mail their generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago to help with its day-to-day expenses which have become ever more so untenable due to the refusal of Deutsche Bank t extend additional loan and the PGA having cancelled future tournaments.The NRA will no longer be able to make shadow donations due to their recent bankruptcy filing, but the billions that Rudy Giuliani will glean from the successful countersuit against Dominion will ensure that Mar-a-Lago is overflowing with orange Nike Soft golf balls and berders for many years to come.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Making Attorneys Get Attorneys"

SEC needs to Check if management shorted this Friday.
Jack should mess up the earnings call tomorrow morning not only will it take down Twitter but it’s gonna take down square ￼
Lawsuits are piling up. You’ll hear about them this week. Unless you listen to MSM. Then again you could also blame MSM from suppressing this information from you! More lawsuits hahaha

"Alternatives to hyper-inflated stocks like Twitter: stocks that are actually profitable, have reasonable P/E ratios and are paying dividends.Real estate, which is booming due to low interest rates.Precious metals like gold and silver.Corporate and municipal bondsCommodity futures- there are many different ones to choose.Being long in hyper-inflated securities is very risky business and is NOT the only game in town.Hedge funds will be driving down the price of stocks like Twitter via massive shorting, much like they did to unprofitable companies like Gamestop, Express, AMC Entertainment, Bed, Bath and Beyond. A short squeeze opportunity in stocks like Twitter will only occur after a massive amount of shorting has occurred, which is in the distance future. Twitter's current short position is a very modest 2.7%.Good all to all."
We the People aren't going to take this much longer! America is about to get really awoke and it's going to start with places like Twitter and Facebook. How long do you really think those places will stay standing once a civil war starts?
"Twitter is going to fail, and here's why. What to watch now is how the so-called Tech Giants go to war with one another. Truth is they hate each other and want a slice of the same pie. Social media is a small part of it to Google and Amazon, they are competing for the Cloud market and the AI which is being rolled out to replace your jobs. I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI, and the plain truth is, that's what Covid is really about. It's blown out of proportion to lay off millions and replace them with IBM Watson and other products. Banks and other are already rolling it out. Meanwhile the battle rages betweem Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud. The war they are fighting between themselves keeps them divided (for now). Twitter is really just a fly on the wall to that lot, and they won't save Twitter."
Never posted before on finance but Twitter has bitten the hand.... unreal
Grea News! Jack named the Minister of Propaganda!
"Obviously retailers will be selling on Monday. Question is will institutions do so as well? If they do and large hedge players short it, then it could be dooms day for Twitter."

4 years the dems harassed and called us names and threatened us. 4 years day after day we seen the dems wasted millions upon millions of dollars trying to change the election. Now they want to cry like the babies they are.
"So twatter shut down MonkeyWerx and MajorPatriot's accounts.

So for presenting the truth their accounts were suspended. Dump this #$%$ stock because the cash burn they are going to go through paying attorneys to defend them in 2021 is going to be significant.

Twitter is the best social medi- app. Twitter made me rich. I invested in Twitter after I saw Jack Dorsey on TV. He inspired me and converted me from conservative to liberal. His ideology is above wisdom. Now I’m in full support of censorship and cancel culture. Lets defend democracy and put decency back in the White House by crushing the deplorable right. Orange man is bad.
Hey Jack
And this moment nothing can save TWTR.
"It's time to sell Twitter has a negative income 1,466,000,000. Anyone holding is going to lose both your freedom and your hard earned dollars."
"While the right is suppose to set up shop at the capitals, I haven’t noticed governors calling their dogs off. All the while they’re planning through Twitter and fb to show up with a decent likelihood of violence. Both groups are equally freaked and the dems can’t figure that out. Nor will the media ask who they are."
We need to go after the companies that run advertisements on Twitter. No support!!
snap is green why is twitter red??
See how they run... There go to the Day Traders...
"There is one way we can send a message to the powers that be, and that is to use the tremendous power of our money. Sure Twitter is a target for bears ( and rightfully so) but there is something else at work here other than that.

Control your money and we’ll what they say then. More to"

"As the country is taken back to prior to 1871 and the United States Corp, now bankrupt, is now under the guidance of the Constitution and not the elite, Zuck, Dorsey, Google, Gates and all the horrifics will be brought down. It's all a matter of a short period of time."

"For the first time in my life I've shorted a stock this week. And when it briefly climbed, shorted it again! TWTR is in a graveyard spiral, and I intend to ride it all the way to the ground. I'm up $250 so far. You don't deny the duly-elected President of The United States free speech!"
And down it goes! Can't stop 75 Million Voices from being heard!
Freedom of speech for all. America.. Not Twitter.
"How many Antifa users has it blocked ? Hopefully, people will stick with their convictions and not buy this until that CEO is canned..."
Looks like we heading up again. Bottom line this was in reversal mode once the week started. We are going back to $55 back Friday. Don’t short base on emotions.
The Oppenheimer analyst is going to get a real life economics lesson that you don't simply shrug off the loss of tens of millions of subscribers.

When the proxy statement arrives...VOTE AGAINST MANAGEMENT and THE BOARD.
your freedom to speak is on the chopping block....make no mistake
if the candle is right this should go to around $63
I think the ISP’s should block Twitter and Facebook for going against their policies.
Just wait until they don't meet numbers and the subscriber base is cut in half. Remember --- it won't be just Americans leaving Twitter.
This guy went off on your boy tonight! Are you guys shorting Twitter?
Sell the stock before the institutional investors start dumping shares front run them !
I hope everyone sells this stockA company that is against free speach should pay. Hope this company goes bankrupt
This stock you can only short.

twitter bird 2021.
This is just the start of the decline.. Joe's policies will put a halt to the markets.. all of them..
Full circle is coming for some of the largest businesses in our country imo. Many businesses like Twitter have become social justice warriors shifting away from corporate values that focus on social welfare and environment. This is a big mistake. Politics don't sell. The consumer always has the last word.

You will see how it works when money cancels you. I urge all stockholders to do the same. Let's show Jack who is really in charge."
Losing money because you invested in a company that encourages peoples opinion's and then censor those who you don't agree with will cause many shareholder lawsuits. A real bonehead move.
Fact is Institutions going to start selling in bulk around $40 to lock in their 100% profits from a few months ago. The selling is only going to be ramped up in the comings days. by feb 9th (earnings) i dont see this stock above 35$ a share.

SELL this company,, SHORT this company,, whatever it takes to crash it.. this is the United States, you don't do what they have done in this country.."
"Twitter reached user saturation nearly 10 years ago. It's simply not a very useful platform for anyone beyond socialites, celebrities, and politicians. Did you ever notice how most of the tweets that the average person hears about are typically embedded in more mainstream news sources? Smoke and mirrors have been the only thing that's been keeping the numbers looking good. IMO it's useless technology that's been struggling for a reason to exist for years."
We'll show Dorksey and basement Jo how to heal....SELL..then SELL some more!
Parler and Clouthub are exploding with new users. Thanks for waking up America!
Don't listen to the bulls. They're going to be unloading shares on Monday and they need to someone to buy their position to hold the bag. Get out while you can. Parler is likely to get millions of new accounts by the time trading opens on Monday.
Membership will likely fall as TWTR is not as popular among next generation of users. TWTR seen as grandparents social news.

The social media platform will eventually make these notes more visible on tweets for its global audience.While it remains in a testing phase, the notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site.""We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,"" Twitter said.Related Link: Tesla Seeks A 'Specialist' To Address 'Social Media Escalations' Aimed At CEO Elon MuskWhy It's Important: Twitter's initiative follows interviews with more than 100 individuals ""across the political spectrum,"" the company said.

"Telegram surpassed 500 million active users in January, according to a statement from Pavel Durov, the messaging app’s founder. Durov noted that 25 million people downloaded the platform in just 72 hours. In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA.This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We’ve had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different.People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users."
So is this a sell? I'm hearing multiple things
Shareholders please sue Twitter. They have not acted in your best interest and have caused you to lose a huge amount of your investments.

"How are the 300 Twitter employees feeling this morning , you know the ones the newspapers said wrote a letter to Jack Dorsey demanding he shut the account down .

I am making a conservative form of twitter. Calling it Chirp.Going to pick up all of Twitters leavers.
Numbers do not lie. Twitter will lose a lot of revenue from users leaving.
I don't really see the intransic value of investing in twitter bird .
"Socialism believes if that the individual is nothing, the state/government is everything. If you fail to believe like you are told, and don't accept government regulation and control over everything, you are the problem to be dealt with (job loss, persecution in all its forms, threats). Twitter is merely another instrument of coercion--coercion is evil and is not acceptable."
I got in at 47 even though I have never touched twitter. No one person/event can stop tech monopolies. FB proved it last year and twitter this year.
"Jo Bydung has hired 14 current and former executives from the BIG 5 tech firms to advise his transition team..this should make the little hairs on your neck stand up, after what we have just witnessed..Sell Baby!!"

This is going to get bad. TWTR is going to suffer. Should we sell before the dump really takes place?Any thoughts?
Be prepared if you own Twitter time to get out. Internet providers are canceling Twitter on there platforms!!Stock is going to drop like a rock!! by June I estimate it will be at 10 bucks!!
i really am enjoying this
Dorsey uses Twitter to play god and not make money. Square is for money and Twitter is for feeling powerful. Get it yet?
"So you stole my vote, but you are not getting my money. I am not investing in leftist media."

No way TWTR stays above 70 today.
Also bring legal action against Twitter for purposely tanking their stock.
"There was a young man called Jack, who had a tattoo of Goebels on his back,while he was the boss, he ran twitter at a loss,and BLM carried money off in a sack..."
TWTR is infiltrated by CCP.BAN TWITTER.
Where is Jacks friends. Oh yea they dont trade stocks.
Dorsey must have taken a fresh hit off of the meth pipe before making the decision to censoring free speech
"I deleted Facebook and Twitter from my cell phone. Now, my battery life is over 2 days. I am so glad I deleted them. Twitter will sink like a lead balloon. Nobody likes being censored."
This is now a $3 stock 
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out censorship. Makes sense.
over TWTR 40M accounts were closed for thew last couple of days. and this is only a beginning.
slowly dropping all day
"The question is not how many TWTR accounts be closed, but how many people closed accounts and left themselves? 50 mil-70 mil?"
HIGH VOLUME SELLOFF will continue. Twitter lost of millions of users permanently.
Regardless of them actually being publishers how can anyone invest in a stock that is run by Jack.
rush limbaugh cancelled his account and millions of his followers I am sure will be cancelling theirs. jack as do many on the left believe party before anything so adios
81 million to 74 million. You lost. Bye-bye.
"how about facts. Average consensus for share price a lot lower than current. EPS is negative, yet share price is going up?"

Democrats who have decried the building of a wall on the Southern Border and tried to stop it seem to be just cool with fencing keeping Americans out of their government as long as it protects Congress.

"Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter pose a direct threat to our democracy. It's time to ""cancel"" them. Is short-term inconvenience worth freedom? You lived without these companies before. You can now. Let the free market replace them."

"There was very few and little attention paid to the months of riots and violence all summer from the left. No interest at all. Now democratic law makers describe what happened last week as a Coup d'état. If this was an attempted Coup d'état, they should take some lessons from the rioters in Oregon.

"twtr has ever had a gut to suspend a BLM leader account who openly promote violence, riot, etc? only in America, there is no consequence to ban a president for twtr accounts. if twtr is to ban the account of antifa or BLM leaders, twtr will be stampeded by BLM."

Lol you know there’s an issue when they write an article saying twitter soars and it goes up 2 bucks and change lmao 
"Twitter's whole business is about selling YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION to third parties. They likely make $$$$'s per user selling your information to anyone who will pay for it, and that includes BAD ACTORS in foreign countries who WILL STEAL that information. You are a commodity to Twitter. It's a meat market, and they are selling us all. FACEBOOK is doing the same thing. Twitter even estimate what you are worth. This is incredible but true, look it up."
"Democrats are not good at business. They are good at corrupted business, but not free market fair and ethical business. The tech oligarchs should focus on BUSINESS and not politics. No good will come of social media and internet businesses focusing on politics instead of business. Let congress in the USA handle politics. Let the people decide how they are governed. Business leaders should stick to BUSINESS."

"Much bigger things coming for TWTR!1/14/15Why Jack Dorsey Sees Bitcoin As The Answer To DT Ban Controversy Bitcoin As The Answer: As Dorsey noted the need to ensure we don’t “erode a free and open global internet,” he said he was particularly passionate about Bitcoin (BTC) because of the “model it demonstrates.”“A foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be,” the Twitter CEO said.Dorsey noted his company’s efforts to develop a decentralized standard for social media to overcome the problem of enforcement of policies.“This will take time to build. We are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks, looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists,” the Twitter CEO said. “No matter the ultimate direction, we will do this work completely through public transparency.”"
"Twitter and Facebook think they are essential, They are not, and they are about to find out in a big way. They are losing half the nation as customers, as Big Tech has shown itself to be monstrous socialists representing a fundamental evil no different than Joseph Stalin."

"No more revenue sell and buy NIO now before you lose more money,"
I'm praying everybody buying puts and shorting this company makes enough money to donate to their local republican lawmaker. Remember guys to not only cancel any subscriptions you have but also deactivate your accounts so that they have a huge drop in users next quarter. Add me on parler @DropShock I will add you guys back and check out my posts.
TWTR was trading below $18/share when Trump won the Presidency in Nov 2016. Trump's usage of Twitter over his 4 years dramatically increased revenues and the stock price. Removing Trump will cost Twitter many followers and revenues. The stock price will parallel those reductions. Biden is just not that interesting and entertaining.
"Hear me now and believe me later, these flabby, weak, cube sitting nerds want to control your freedom.All conservatives are at risk, first it was one person blocked, then 70,000 more, whats next 75 Million ?"

"The brand new Birdwatch program is doomed to fail as people will not want their posts ""cancelled"" by incredibly biased left-wing radials.

Too little, too late."

But Alas! the anger, disrespect to democracy, intolerance, bad behave & temperament, lack of risk (virus) management, unethical works due to ""I am a king"" like attitude etc became his auto-immune diseases. He himself destroyed him, no one else."

Man look at the trumpsters holding this back lol
"1st it's Alex Jones, now it the president, meanwhile ACTUAL TERROR GROUPS still have twitter and Facebook accounts. Now Parlor is being taken down.

Twitter is losing users by the MILLIONS!!! Bye bye Twitter. You'll soon be non existent
next qtr results will send this down 30%
Acquitted. Now get ready for Trump 2024. :-)
Nothing beats watching you liberal twits loose your money on Twitter. Institutions are going to run real soon . It’s all about profit and how many subjects Twitter has
"All it took was for me to sell some shares after holding for over 3 years. Still have a 6 figure position. Just would have been a little bigger; congrats to long term holders, and to those with low entry points."
Only Twitter picks the day off a major market reversal to rally. I hate this stock.
Looks like a good short purchase to me!!
Ouch! Now down 3% and dropping.
"Assume TWTR is going to blow a NUT of cash buying stock in order to prop this up short term. Keep on shorting. Its inevitable this communist censorship platform will have no place in America regardless of political persuasion. I have not shorted it yet, but plan on doing so at 49-50"
Twitter keeps losing money and that matters...when the bubble bursts
Twitter opposes free speech. Delete your account. I have. Encourage others to do the same. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Sell your stock.
This is short lived.......TWTR is going down the tubes. It's being propped up until big guys can get their money out........then watch

Jack Dorsey.... “Not an American. A Creature of Big Tech”. So said Rudy Giuliani.Sell into oblivion!
Interesting how Parler went to #1 before cut. Twitter replaceable? Investable?
Forget about 2020...Start thinking about 2022.....Make America Sane Again....
"Wow. Earned myself a veritable army of ""thumbs down"" shock troops. I wear them as badges of honor.Hey, any idea is Rudy Giuliani is going to sue New York for cancelling his clients contracts, Deutsche Bank for refusing to make any new loans to his client and the PGA for cancelling their tournaments at his clients courses?Rudy has had a great track record of late for winning cases on behalf of his clientMaybe when he gets back from his Ukraine Walkabout 2.0, trying to replace the evidence that Tucker Carlson ""lost in the mail""?"

Anyone really miss being on twitter......I have not.
"It’s not just in the US...TWTR is censoring accounts un every country. They are not a symbol of free speech any more. They have chosen to defend lefties ideas everywhere...and will loose 50% of clients everywhere, as simple as that."
I wouldn’t fall for this trap. This is how fake the stock market is. Something is coming and I believe this will come down like a house of cards
Sell before it’s too late!
How many people are going to quit Twitter now? Who even cares about Twitter? It could disappear and the world would be better off.
why are you censoring the word chiiina
"Like always, when the qrtly report was good, the market will turn red! When is this thread going to stop for twtr! "
"Sold all my Apple shares and split the considerable proceeds between QCOM and AVGO. Next up, I was waiting to get the iPhone 12 for 5G capability ( I have an iPhone 8). Guess what? Going with the Samsung Galaxy (don't know what model yet). At least I know they will have the latest Snapdragon chipset from QCOM which is the best by far in the industry. It's going to be a little of a learning curve since I never used anything but iPhones, but I refuse to support in any way a company that censors people. It is up to us to make these companies understand this is not China or a banana republic dictatorship."
how dare Uganda ban twitter....lol...
TWITEE UNCONTROL TO FLYING HIGHER.......so high that it cannot hear the BASHER...... sorry basher but the $100's level is now within reach
"Liberals - when you read this board, notice the seriousness in the tone of what’s going on here? Who’s side are you going to be on?"
Maybe Americans can unite around the fact that we will not be censored!
"Last week on: CNBC - Fast Money analyst/guest - Dan Nathan called TWTR stock "" TOAST "" going forwardFOX BUSINESS - On Charles Payne Show - Fund manager- Mark Tepper of Strategic Weatlh said hee unloaded all his fund shares of Twitter because Twitter block his tweet just telling ""all "" Georgians to vote.Mark said that was the last straw for him on stifing free speech and saw this a negative sign for Twitter's future subscriber growth."
We tried to warn ya! Mass migration of illegals from Guatemala and sure to pick up more along the way to the US. Guess what they running from? Socialist government. Maybe they’ll turn back in a few years cause that’s where we headed. Maybe we join them?

Thank gawd I never bought into the social media hype. Never established and account with any of them. Why in the he|| would you trust a heroin addict with your personal information anyway?
"For any institutional upgrade $TWTR , need to be arrested for Pump and Dump scheme. Duh every1 has 20/20 eyesight"

"Boycotting of businesses that advertise on Twitter, FB and Google by 75 million Constitution loving Americans will drive Twotter out of business and FB to double digits."
This #$%$ is heading below $40 this week
Twitter has already has estimated lost over 2.6 billion in revenue from banning Trump due to the massive amount of followers he had made your bed now lay in itthats just from his account not counting the fall out from other that are leaving twitter. Facebook and Twitter have already lost together 51billion in market valuesee what happens when you are a platform supposedly designed for everyone and you think got to big for you pants and and control with your bias opinions
haha look at all the BAGHOLDERS... volume will not support selling aftermarket!
NASDAQ takes a dip...TWTR advances. Someone (Jack?) is jacking with the levers. This never ends well. Good luck in orange.

"All jokes aside, look at Twitter before and after trumps term."
Already on a down trend....and with the news gonna be at least 3 days of red. Probably more....i wouldn’t buy it for $14.
Dive !!! Dive !!! just like a submarine...
IMHO tweeter/Facebook will be shut down next week
No more freedom speech
Users leaving TWTR is only just beginning. Millions have left already - but that's just the beginning. Not many advertisers will want to waste money on this sinking ship. Those that do will only do so because the decision makers for those companies are as far left wing as Dorsey. Wasting company money to advertise just to support someone else's political stance will not sit too well with those companies and heads will roll. This ship is sinking - and it's not alone.
So is how does Dorsey plan to spin his new user count next earnings? Maybe he is hoping for chinese customers.
How many time has jack said “oh that was a mistake” when confronted in hearings about them silencing someone or something? I think it was at the least three times. I always thought it was three and out right?
"Why does the media facilitate Don Lemon trying to associate conservatives with any nasty hate group he can think of, including the clan and national socialists (such comparison being made on the basis of identity politics and not on true actions or beliefs--just whether he can produce an example of a bad person who happens to vote one way or the other and branding everyone that way)? It is a fact that no Republicans owned any slaves a year before the civil war, that the Republican party was formed to eliminate slavery, that the Republican party introduced civil rights legislation, and that the Democratic party (actions, not mere identity) supported slavery, jim crow, etc., well into the 1960s or so. In fact, why tear down statutes of dead people when you have the actual organization that did all that, alive and well today? Reparations? Go talk to the Democratic party."
This is going up for no reason
"All technicals r strong buy..hourly,daily, weekly, monthly..."
"Also selling my shares in Facebook , Twitter , Microsoft. For censorship rights."
Twitter is going down!
Somehow 45 is even playing more golf now than he did in office. I would have thunk that was impossible.

Matt? Sam? How are those Puts?
Sad day in America when the liberal/socialist big tech media companies shut down free speech! And at the same time limit any other social media company/s (like Parlor) with the ability to compete in the market! Now we as Americans get to see what it's like in other socialist countries. And the saddest thing is how young Americans think socialism is OK. That's what you get when the majority of liberal /socialist teachers and professors are brainwashing them in the schools.

"Sold all my Twitter shares today. Next, Amazon, Google, etc. !!!!"
"If this falls $5 today, I am cracking open champagne."
What is Twitter? Ever ask yourself that question? What makes it soooo special and unique? It is a social media message board. YOU do ALL the work by keeping the site active and they reap in the cash. It is like an art teacher handing out blank canvases and then selling the students paintings. The user gets nothing of value in return. You get...

"Twitter MUST Disclose material USER loses via 8K or face Investor lawsuitsRule 405 under the Securities Act defined the term “material” as follows: “when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of information as to any subject, [materiality] limits the information required to those matters to which an average prudent investor ought reasonably to be informed before purchasing a security."

"People deserve the government they elect... Soon, Americans will reap what they sowed!"
"Surprised it hasn't fallen further. There's a huge exodus away from the both Twitter and Facebook occurring at the moment, judging by the numbers deluging alt tech sites. Parler will probably restart and do as Gab did, building it's own infrastructure. Even if it doesn't, Twitter has ensured that its growth will dimish."

What time is the protest at TWTR headquarters?
Twitter trending upwards. great job you the man Dorsey
The stock is defying gravity. Fundamentals do not indicate that there is going to be explosive bottom line growth in this stock.
Bloodbath.
"If you think the bottom of this stock is in, consider you permanently deleted 50% of your base and from the time that was announced the stock is down less than 10%. Think NBA."
everyone deactivate your twitter account!!!
Jack Dorsey is getting punished by the market?

Just wait until the Conservatives start their own service. Get out NOW.

"The number of protesters who peacefully assembled on the mall in Washington, D. C. on January 6th is estimated to be 200,000. The number of citizens who entered the Capital building that afternoon is estimated to be 200. That means that only 1/10 of 1% of the protesters morphed into insurrectionists. The Left will try to link conservative patriots with those right-wing anarchists in an attempt to demonize and silence us. We must resist this false caricature in every legal way possible."

Take your gains today and run ... In Germany is way down.
Share Big Tech is going down soon..see after hour...
"Hate speech is dangerous, and if it leads to violence a private enterprise could be held liable. That being said, there is another danger here - what is considered hate speech? If you listen to the media, anything said by Republicans or conservatives is deemed hate speech. There is clearly an effort to silence opposition by the left here."
45 lost the popular vote each time he ran. Never had a mandate.
"Imagine the irony that it takes the Democrats, the political party of slavery to bring back segregation and try to make it cool again. I’d say unbelievable but it’s far to easy to believe unfortunately. They’ll give liberals a protected social media and space to converse online and then grant conservatives permission to go recreate our own, separate platforms from scratch. WAKE UP PEOPLE."
>>>THEY SELL DATA TO CHINA? Facebook and Twitter $FB $TWTR sell Sell SELL!
"Had Twitter stocks for the last 12 months but I’ll be selling my 10.000 shares today at the opening. I don’t want to own a company that is biased and is limiting the freedom of speech, that’s just over the limits for me."
You will never be free as long as we use Dominion voting machines.
wow i just looked at twtr chart ytd why are you still holding? look
Twtr take away freedom of speech—— going dowwwwwwn.
"News: Joe is having every single one of the 25,000 National Guard troops vetted, just in case any of them are conservatives. That's extreme and show how afraid the man is. They are totally paranoid. Did Joe win the election? Clearly no."
This is speculation on speculation. Twitter lost 1.15 Billion last year. All of the interesting personalities and topics are censored.
How long can they hide the # of deactivations? Not forever.
So does Dorsey know that he lost half his assets? Users are his assets. But he is still stuck with high debt and only half of his assets operating. Timber!
"Do you all aware that every time the day after Twitter release earning report, market crash ! This happened many many times already!"
"half of its customers are leaving for what thy did, as in 50% drop...that is worse than what happened to myspace in one year."
My price target is 13$. This stock is OVERVALUEED. Especially as other countries put down laws to stop twitter.
Angela Merkel just condemned TWTR. Germany knows a thing or two because they did a thing or two...Pay attention America!
GET WOKE GO BROKE
we just need to have diamond hands.....it does not even matter this stock has no growth! Remember diamond hands!
Charge for Twitter? Time to short this one.
what goes better with conservative tears? hot dogs or hamburgers?
Anyone miss this fraud?
"A business model dictated by Nancy Pelosi. Great plan, Jack."
Private Company my ars. So why is it Publicly traded with government subsidies? This company will not be able to handle the tsunami of lawsuits coming in.
I believe the current CEO of Twitter has chosen the path that was given to him by more powerful people. He is not actually capable of making these waves of change decisions on his own while spending 90% of his time disconnecting from his worst fear...people.
Send this piece of horse schiff to the single digits and a big phat #$%$ ewe to Jack the meth head CEO.
We the people have a choice and I choose freedom.
I got the feeling it's more then left wing Democrats. Maybe China has Jack by the earlop. I'm sure they approve of these new bans.
"TWTR, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB are responsible for the whole situation, the division of people in the US."
George Orwell was right
Twitter will get its wish a solely Democratic social media sight. We get to sit back and watch them fight with one another.
How is this company market cap worth more than twitter $twtr and pinterest $pins market cap combines?
I've had it with twitter.
"Twitter is facing a MAJOR problem: young people dont use it, Numbers of suers will NEVER grow ... And top of that, the tool is very obsolete .... R.I.P Twitter"
Stock keeps going up even though right-wingers encourage people to cancel their accounts. That makes me hopeful.
"My optimistic nature does not allow me to short stocks. However, this TWTR seems to be a slam dunk for shorting."
"The short fact of the matter is... no matter what Dorsey does now, the damage is done"
"Twitter and Facebook not only rob you of your fundamental right of freedom of speech, they also remove your right to privacy, since they SELL YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. And you probably wondered how you got hacked or how your personal data ended up on the Dark Web?"
"go short, thank me l8ter"
I already deleted my account.
The collapse will soon intensify. Twitter will be $15 in a year.
Twitter has told half of their subscribers to go pound sand. Their subscribers will fall dramatically.AOL 2.0 and MySpace 2.010 dollar stock by summer time
The bleed to $15 has started.
Sold all my shares and now I’m going to short it all the way to the $20 I originally bought it for
Told ya Twitter was gonna romp you shorts. And great to see MARJ on the street corner.
"Dorsey says: I'll tell you what to think, when to think and when you can speak."
Twitter stock is going nowhere. It's at the same price it was 5 years ago.
"BIg news. Twitter buys Revue giving authors/posters a way to monetize their audience on Twitter. This has been something needed for a long time. Now that people can make money on Twitter, expect higher user engagement and more people pushing their online audiences to Twitter. Get out now shorts, while you still have your shirts."
Liberal skhum will be shorting their own Liberal skhum social media Mon morn. LMAO
"David, Chuck...will u guys buy my shares when I cover my short on Monday? I know u will. #brokelibs"
Hope this gets shorted to $1
cancel culture takes a a financial bath tomorrow morning
"Was Janet Yellen involved in the halting of trading in order to protect Citadel, a hedge fund that previously paid her nearly $1 million in speaking fees?"
Closed my Twitter account today and shorted stock after hours on Friday. I still find it funny how some people still think we are twitter’s customers. We are their product. We are what is sold to advertisers.
"Hey SEC, any chance of looking at a company which in QE2, declared a loss of over $7 Million while handing away $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM? Also any chance of looking at a company whose CEO has actively discouraged half the users to leave his platform, doesn't sound like due diligence to me."
You people are lucky this is only $10 from its high.
The best way to make twitter pay for free speach sensorship is to sell all your shares. Let’s make this go down to zero!!!
Institutions are rushing for the door. This is seriously going to collapse. I bet the fall from 45 to 35 is a very short time...
This was always supposed to be my boat upgrade money.... my boat is getting bigger!!!
many cover tomorrow. short squeeze
Do more then deactivate.. Delete the APP from your mobile devices.
Pull up the one-month chart and have a look at the trend. The trend is not a friend for longs. Could be wrong.
I sold all my Shares and closed my account
"I really enjoy watching this stock tank. I wake up each morning thanking GOD he gave Dorksey this portfolio . May we unite today in this goal, bring America together! And give Dorksey a united send off."
"chart says it is heading back to $46 in couple days, forming head and shouldernot a good sign...it will then keep going down to $36.."
Don't be deceived by this earnings release. It actually makes sense because this report includes data when trump was still on the platform and during this time he was causing all sorts of drama due to the election situation. The next earnings release is the one you need to be concerned with since those earnings will include when Trump was banned and the subsequent fallout from it.
"Get woke, go broke."
"TELEGRAM is the New Thing,its cool,its does not suppress your Freedom of Speech or our Great Constitution..."
Shorting this for Patriots!
"Just think: for the rest of your lifetime, a Con party member will never hold the Presidency. The Con party will never hold the Congress. The Con party will fracture and divide and never be able to win an election again. No matter how old you are, IN YOUR LIFETIME, tweet this far, you will NEVER see another Con win the big offices."
tank twitter you deserve everything you get now.....let's censor Twitter!!!!!!
"My business boarded up a lot of windows in downtown Chicago when the riots started .Who wants to live like that ? And pay employees over 45.00 per hour , and pay high taxes ?You liberal that voted for joe just watch the jobs numbers the next 4 years"
Have started shorting TWTR. Others feel free to join in. SQ needs to also be heavily shorted!
"good squeeze, but it will end, than the sell off, smart ones getting out know"
We need a 20 dollar drop tomorrow!
"Cuckoo Dorsey has lowered the bar of what an American company is, and in doing so created the opportunity for a President that slashes 1,000,000 plus American jobs with his pen."
Deactivated my account!
"YHO is in on the scam. Shameful to censor posts that don't violate their published TOS. By doing this, you are admitting your complicity."
$71 P's up 400% in 48 hours...cancel Twit!
green again great job twitter you the man Dorsey
Most MAGA and QAnon people overdosed on hydoxychloroquine.
Dorsey gave $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM people. Think about it. He is not on the side of shareholders.
"I'm gonna got out on a limb this Sunday. I'm gonna watch the Super Bowl ""BUT"" I'm gonna wear my ""Re-Elect Turnip"" hat so that I can avoid becoming and ""enemy of the people"".Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - McDonalds and Golf Again!"
This will close at 34
"I am amazed that Amazon, is now monitoring their server instances to decide who can and can't be allowed to run their websites or host their applications.....talk about big brother forcing their will....what Parlar does is none of their business unless its tool for the left.."
What's with the long funeral procession on tv
Rush Limbaugh just deactivated his Twitter ..good job Jack
Wait!! How about parler taking over???? 
George Soro is the only one trying to prop this up and he'll lose
Twitter is in the process of losing millions of followers. Can't be good for their upcoming stock price.
Communism meeting Capitalism everyday for the last 2 weeks. Communism loses every time...
twtr ceo pumps his stock last week; now he's dumping his stock this week...
Remember diamond hands! We can moon this like GME!
George Soros will lose several billions $ in Twitter. It ran out of steam.
Where do you get the report? I am on their financial web page. So far nothing new posted.
"The Newsom recall effort has finally “almost” delivered enough signatures after almost a year. The primary driver is newsom’s pandemic policy. The Abbott recall only started this week, although it will only take 2 weeks to gather enough frozen squiggles for his recall."
"Rudy Giuliani has now been instructed by his client to sue the My Pillow CEO due to his client being unable to sleep, Deutsche Bank for refusing to lend his client more money, the PGA for cancelling the tournaments booked at his client's properties, the Florida county that is making his client live up to his residence exclusion agreement, the Government for withdrawing the unbridled use of the coal-fueled Air Force One golf cart and the NRA for going bankrupt and being unable to give more money to the cause.Rudy will soon (in the next two weeks) reveal his evidence gleaned from the latest Lev Parnas-sponsored Ukraine Walkabout 2.0. A copy was given to Tucker Carlson, who unfortunately ""lost it in the mail"" on the same night that his dog ate his homework.Rudy Giuliani is hopeful that his client won't stiff him for all the successful legal work he conducted in more than 60 courts, including his submission to the Supreme Court (which sources have said Mr. Giuliani also intends to sue on behalf of his client).Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Making Attorneys Get Attorneys"
Twitter should be a $30 stock before the end of the this month. They just lost half of their users LOL
Twitter=1984!!!
Institutions running for the exits!
India is banning Twitter from being used in their country. India is #3 in the world for Twitter users. India is taking a stand against corporations that are silencing free speech.
I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10 foot pole
Dozens of celebrities sent a letter to Joe to shut down the pipeline. Now all the oil can go thru our cities on Warren Buffet's trains.
Had twitter not been buying its own shares it would have been worse. Institutional investors will start looking a exit points now. Get out.
I did a 1 day chart overlay of $PINS and $TWTR (feel free). They are veritable copies of each other today.Not sure why they are so linked at the hip except social media ... thoughts?
We are living in a socialist country where freedom of speech is banned. Sold my shares after hours
Deactivated both Twitter Accounts! #$%$ Jack!
kohl's and Bed Bath and Beyond two companies supporting socialistts communitss and censorshipp.
"Parler, the leper colony of social media."
"The last admin would have played a disaster in Michigan. Just like on 10/16/2020 when wildfire relief was denied to California because they didn’t make enough mango love. I think Texas needs to apologize to Joe for not voting for him. Maybe they’ll free up our aid to them. Probably not. Don’t care. Let me all freeze. Sincerely, not the California earthquake."
I'm the smart one never downloaded this #$%$ I'll have the wife cancel her account later.
Anyone got any new Pelosi got arrest in Canada...news around but not confirm..after laptop got stolen by army.
"we all can contact the FCC by phone , e mail to voice your anger to big tech blocking free speech ,"
Dorsey should be sued personally for causing shareholders to incur losses due to his poor business management.
TWTR is the Golden Globes of the Internet
"sewer swalwell named as impeachment manager. his guy was in bed with Fang Fang.I have seen it all. Dems out of control, can do whatever they want, no laws no nothing. dump all lefty media now"
"That’s why I think Crazy Joe is going to have a complete breakdown in office, with his temper and questionable technical speaking skills I don’t think he’ll be able to handle the charges and evidence being brought forward."
Since getting rid of the terrorist in chief this stock is doing well. Actual investors go where the money is.
Twitter still not admitting that the Hunter Biden laptop story was accurate and there are still tons of active posts about the farcical 'Russian Collusion' narrative they pushed for 4 years .
Instead of purging fake accounts Twitter is going to have to start creating bot accounts lol
"Sell, Selll, sell, selll Now"
This has been a terrible run since $71 Jan 2014...waiting too long!! Should have backed Facebook instead.
I think Dorsey and Zuckerberg made a big mistake mixing politics with free markets.
"TWTR won't even exist in two years, bankruptcy is what I predict!"
"I say again, the ONLY asset Twitter and Facebook have are its users and if they are so high and mighty to discard them at will, then they get what they deserve."
"I was tortured for this pick by an investment group for years. But we picked it up in high teens and low 20s. I said, “expect a long long slow March to 70 for technical reasons, and then look out above, as this is the only internet property with staying power because of celebrity, corporate, and government adoption.” I expect a few apologies in my email tonight. Even I had lost faith and sold a small portion when covered calls expired in the money as few months ago. Still have a disabled position though."
Easiest short this upcoming week. $40 by Friday
I'm glad to see these platform stocks going down right now. These companies shouldn't limit anyone from typing their mind. Only lemmings take anyone serious on these message boards anyways
TWTR lit up tonight with comments on CPAC.
Another billion gone from market cap! oooof
I am selling. Many Trumpers left Twitter. (74 million Trumpers). So next figures will be not that good.I am buying Anab. Could double this very year and not much risks.Good luckOther stocks value too high for me.
Twitter...making investors rich!!
Green soon
"Jack Dorsey's OTHER company, SQ, up 6.5% TODAY! LMAO Do you little rightwingers feel a little bit spat upon?"
A 20% haircut seems too reasonable for the corruption
Walking corpse in charge till 2024. Not good. TWTR about to get a $10 haircut this year
good entry point ... that is if you want to lose half of your money!
"Anyone involved with twitter is going to hell, investors included"" Twitter repeatedly told the victim of child sexual abuse that a video of his ordeal circulating on the platform didn’t violate the platform’s policies, according to a lawsuit filed on the victim’s behalf by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. """
"Take a Red Pill, Wake up and come to Texas."
oh no another down day.....
Has any read the letter Nancy sent to the mayor of Portland. If you haven't google it . If this is true it shows how sleazy she is.
Why TWTR when you've got Yahoo message boards.
Is Jack Dorsey part of The Lincoln Project?
Colin Kapernick took a knee against America. How did that work out for his career? Just saying....
"It's Thursday, January 14, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
"My opinion is shut down these companies that have their own biases. Twitter makes every decision on their profitability. If it means supporting a candidate that believes in globalism and not America first because its more profitable, they can use it for propaganda to silence the opposition. This company interfered with our elections and should be shut down."
"It's Thursday, January 21, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
Almost time for bed if I can sleep. Got to be up early for the glee of watching Twitter die a very public and painful death including RICO charges.
Don’t forget the 10% for the big guy.
Changes in followers. @MikePence: -80k @Jim_Jordan: -160k @DailyCaller: -90k || @JoeBiden: + 1 million @KamalaHarris: +600k @AOC: +300k. Safe to say that many of those are new. I don't think $TWTR is losing a lot of users.
Looks like conservative states are getting together on sensorship. Congressman from Florida said to ban big tech. I
"From Bloomberg---""Despite the recent gains, Wall Street remains mixed on Twitter’s longer-term prospects. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 12 firms recommend buying the stock, compared with 24 that have a neutral view and five that have a bearish rating. The average price target of nearly $62 is about 17% below the current price."" Average Price Target is $62...17% below current market!! Ooops!!"
"F Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, Google, YAHOO/Verizon—meet the Sherman Act and RICO."
You can post video about Tiananmen Square on Twitter. You can even post the photos showing those that didn’t make it. Not sure what the problem is.
More calls Twitter Twitter Twitter
Idaho ISP blocks $FB and Twitter... more ISP to follow
Sell & profit now or come fly with us to $ 150 plus elevation. You will have a tough time buying back because you cannot buy a cheaper ticket to fly.......... This is destined to happen as I also predicted that Pfe will be the pioner to covid 19 vaccine.... pfe will go up soon
Sell it now
Twitter share holders you have already lost 20% in the last 7 trading days !The million dollar question is how much more money are you willing to loose ? Another 20-40
TWR is heading...round the bowl and down the hole. Good bye.
rush limbaugh cancelled his account. 80 million followers
There is special place in pink sheets for TWTR.
Twatter will get blasted into a Pink Sheets stock then to zero.
i wish someone would do a large market sell order already 
"Ouch! Dow is up but Twittylee is down AGAIN! Did someone say ""Parler""?"
Jack Dorsey = Joseph Goebbels
FAKE news media on full swing. Supported by Democrats
$100 in 12-24 months... bring the hate!
Crazy Joe is gonna have a complete breakdown in his first month. Any bets?
Last summer every city controlled by democrats ordered their police departments to stand down while rioters and looters destroyed hundreds of business's ...Democrats defunded their police departments...Funny how those chickens came home to roast...Now democrats are outraged that the capital police couldn't keep rioters out of the capital..Cops today are afraid to take action because democrats will have the cops arrested.....
Twitter will be left with kids (that make no money) and liberals (that can't think for themself). Recipe for disaster! Grab your popcorn!
Fell below the 100 day. more pain tomorrow
Sell this stock China Twitter
"“The mob was fed lies,” McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”"
fake insider buying going on.
Gab and Parlor are the future.Twitters just a has-been co.
Just wait till Options Friday plummet...
"The left-wingers will try and buy the stock to prop it up as long as they can. When the 4Q 2020 earnings are released and the Analysts ask questions about how many registered users at end of January 2021 versus end of Dec 2020......look out below! The wealthy fascists may still be able to buy the stock on the way down, but eventually this t u r d is going to lose at least 50% of it's peak value."
Easiest short this year. Losing accounts caused by jack’s censorship. Love watching this crash to 20 or below.
And don't forget to cancel you WhatsApp account too.
"We the people have the right to choose, I choose freedom!!!! Down with Twitter!"
315 million moentizable users sounds very bullish. People buying at 70s are expecting it to reach to $150 in an year or so. So I am not selling a single share.
"I'm a Conservative. I Manage a Hedge-Fund, and I am shorting Twitter. lol"
"Today is Friday, January 15, 2021 and Twitter with Facebook are garbage companies that spy on you, censor news, and sell your personal information to whomever would buy it."
I laugh seeing this stock getting propped up before earnings and its obvious. this will come down to $20 and ill have my puts ready
Parler just needs to add some moderation. Free speech doesn’t include calls to violence.
Take your profits on the stock. I know many people who have left their Twitter feeds because it has become a propaganda operation. Advertisers are not dumb. They will not pay.
TWTR actions are backfiring. People are dumping shares. There will be lawsuites rest assured. Congratulations Jack. When you stop being neutral there is a cost.
I will never use Twitter again. hope it crashes.
Cancel those that cancel.
TWTR HAS BECOME THE THE POSTER CHILD OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DICTATOR CONTROL OF THE WEB. MOST DICTATORS HISTORY TELLS US FALL AND FAIL! $25 BT EOD EASY
Do conspiracy-theorists ever catch their tails? Do they catch the parked car once in a while? I'm just wondering and am aiming for eight thumbs down in less than ten minutes to prove my bigly point.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Attorney Got Arrested?
"The notion that Mellissa Carone, whose statements about alleged voter fraud drew laughter from people attending a fake hearing, will run to represent the 46th District of the state legislature in Michigan should give everyone, in the tweet ridiculous bat kid and Russian loving tweet kisser James, Pause."
Wait untill a Red Market day This #$%$ Won't float...
Russia and China are now laughing at us. We need to unite. Twitter needs to GO!!!
The President of the USA is Xi Jinping...
"Hero Jack Dorsey! Laughing at the shorts and rightw!ng Gütterträsh, everyday!"
"For those that don’t know about the Industrial revolution. As history looks back at it, essentially it is a group of powerful rich people that destroy everyone and everything in their path in order to achieve ultimate wealth. The result was global division that is still present today.Dorsey has made a historically horrible decision."
"BTW, there is no such things called conspiracy theories. They are all possibilities, could be false or could be true. When something happens, which could be anything in this universe, whose cause is apparently unknown, to investigate or analyze why did it happen investigators come up with several possibilities e.g. theories. Then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause. That's the process. 100 years ago Albert Einstein's created many theories that were not proven at all until now. So if you use conspiracy theory then Albert Einstein's theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well - right? In his theory, legendary scientist Stephen Hawking said black holes could emit radiation, it's called Hawking Radiation. Not proven, no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true. So Hawking's theory is a conspiracy theory - right? Once again there is no such things called conspiracy theories - instead they are all possibilities, could be true could be false."
"25th amendment will be acted upon via kamala Harris within 2 years. Backed by the radical left in the house and the turncoat deep state Republicans. Otherwise, they will lose power within two years as the American people elect true representatives that will put an end to this..."
"I hope Parler sues Amazon for $100B. This is not fair, only happens in fqXi China!!"
Short-sellers unite!
I get the feeling that TWTR unwittingly united both the left and the right against big tech and social media. The left just doesn’t know it yet.
You can't do communism and expect to have capitalism. This stock is finished.
Bird Watch is going to watch Revenue fly out the window on the next earnings reports when they find out they're down 90 million plus subscribers
send Dorsey to the poor house. Sell Sell Sell
brenda is getting rich on rkt right now... :(
In 2018 the top 1% of wage earners paid 615 billion in taxes. The bottom 90% paid 440 billion. I'm just making a factual comment and watch I'll get some thumbs down.
"Short, Short, Short!!!!!"
Yahoo now deleting top posts on this site.
I can see big tech Actually crashing come Monday a lot of investors don’t like what’s happening they will be cashing out running out the doors
Hannity just told everyone to leave twitter and go to Parler on his show
I AM NOT TAKING PROFIT BECAUSE TWITEE JUST ON THE FIRST ROUNd OF FLYING HIGHER.... GOING AT A RATE OF $150 plus & plus !!!!!!!!!!!!!! TWITTER IS OFFICIALLY THE BEST INSTANT COMMUNICATION IN THE ENTIRE PLANET
Let's take down Dorsey and Twitter.
"If you’re investing your money into Twitter, then you have too much money on your hands, I figure and if you’re buying now, you deserve to lose  Invest in something worthwhile."
TWTR becomes a stale echo chamber in long run. Not the best time to own social media.
"If you are not out of Twitter yet, GET OUT ASAP! Twitter is going down!!!"
"One thing is obvious from Dorsey's response yesterday. America has changed as we know it. Liberals running wild, freedom of speech is being lost, hypocrites all over the place. Elite becoming more elite, the every day common man (opps person) is being lost in this country. Big tech getting more powerful, we are on our way to a socialist or Communist country. China, Russia, Iran all laughing in our face. We are DOG poop.Remember though--- what causes uprisings and grass roots movements??? These events do. People do not like being silenced, they want their voices heard. Remember 2022 is coming. Send a message. It all tarts with the House. Get some common sense and real Americans in the House. Put Nancy out to pasture. Fore the SQUAD. Its all up to you. Take your country back. Peacefully. And why not???"
This will be the third day in a row that the DOW is down. Is this the beginning of a bear market. Artificially inflated companies like Twitter are going to take a beating.
Millions of patriots deactivated their Twatter accounts.
I was saddened to see Don Jr not getting treatment. He looks very bad in his latest tweet video of guns threatening teachers. Hunter had a loving family who are working with him to treat his addictions. The trunp family is practicing Turner-Don Diaries on their own kid.
Why does the Ayatollah still have an active account?
"On Feb. 3,2014- Twitter closed at 54.91Nearly 7 years later- Feb. 1, 2021- Twitter closed at 52.66 During that 7 year period, Twitter was down 3.09%., and yet during the exact period of time the DOW went from 15,794 to 30,212, for a rise of 91.29%. Relatively speaking, Twitter has been a terrible investment, and I believe it will continue be a lousy investment for the following facts: negative earnings, no dividend, recent reduction in users, a lawsuit for child sexual was filed last week, and additional child porn lawsuits are expected to be filed in the near future.People on the Left who have invested in Twitter for political reasons , not financial/business ones, I believe will come to regret it."
We got a leaker!
"Id like to know how many shares Oppenheimer sold into their ""price raise"". Or if they received any kinda of compensation of any kind.This is the type of stuff, regardless of political leanings, is what our government should be working to rid us of!"
Sell this radical left political platform.
"Well I don't live in the US and I don't really have a preference for Democrat or Republican leadership as an investor both of them have their good and bad sides. How ever as far as twitter goes, you have to wonder which opinions will be deemed unacceptable next and will start facing censorship."
"Dorsey's mindless babble trying to justify his censorship did nothing to stop the sell-off. TWTR is now DOWN 14% this week, and there's is no support below the current price. Loss of $6BILLION for shareholders."
"TWTR is the next MySpace. In case the self righteous Wokers running TWTR doesn't know what that it is. Too bad for you. You're about to learn. Words of advice. Text your parents and ask them to get the basement ready for your return. After all. It's not that hard to put up a website on internet. Just as the internet is new and exciting, in years to come it will also be littered with sad tales of self destruction. TWTR makes nothing. It traffics only in text. Their self importance and societies police is the beginning of the end for them. Facebook too."
I truly hope this company goes bankrupt
I love  Trump obviously  BUT even I knew when he said “the stock market would crash  if I lose” I knew to get long.......his track record with his stock market predictions hasn’t exactly been spot on........

Can someone point me in the direction of the nearest apothecary ?
then 35 to 25 the week after.
MMs holding it up to let certain holders out ! After this process takes place kaboom it will drop like a rock
did you notice Yahoo fake news deletes every comment that has the name of president?
Not impressed by Twitter’s CEO trying to answer questions from Cruz.
Twitter Blocked Links To CPAC’s Website. It Now Claims It Was Just An ‘Error’
Bought today..
"Report looks pretty good. Good growth in key user metrics, decent EPS, and generating twice as much cash flow as same period last year.Expect the price will be volatile for a couple of days and then the upward trend will continue in the coming weeks.Think long, folks, don't dance to the pump-and-dump musicians.BTW: I hate this company and it's politics. And I believe the CEO is out of his depth. But that doesn't take away from the excellent market position and growth potential."
Sell Sell Sell
Cancel Twitter and move to free speech platforms like Gab and Parler!
MySpace > Twitter
Great.... back on the downward trend!
"Here's the deal, man. That was a bad and fraudulent report."
the list of things not to be said grows try it
AI is being rolled out everywhere. Banks love AI already. It will replace all kinds of repititive jobs. Even at Mickey Dee's. It will be IBM Watson taking your order at the drive through. The burger will be made by machines inside. The only employee is the person who keeps it working. So more layoff's are coming. Covid-19 was the excuse to lay people off btw. Oh and I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI seen it all coming. It's here. Your jobs are gone.
Where does Dorsey live? Anyone have an address?
This stock to the moon..Perfect business model!!! who else has a free speech platform with out free speech besides Twitter!! OK maybe fakebook
Kristi Noem for President 2024.....
TWTR will claim no drop in user base - it will be a lie - but the will claim it.
"feel bad for the investors in Twitter, but this is what Twitter deserves."
"Big Tech TWTR, APPLE, FB, AMAZON, GOOGLE banded together to squash out a tiny company, Parler because it's not doing what they are doing! Do people understand this?"
It was the platform that 85 million used to get in touch with the president
The US has 3 or 4 times as many COVID19 cases as China or India and they both have over 3 billion people while the US only has a little over 300 million. It’s a shame the previous administration didn’t take COVID19 more seriously. Remember “only 15 cases soon to be zero” or “it’s fully contained and will disappear like magic.”The US now has 25 MILLION COVID19 cases.
Breaking: Twitter calls for George Washington’s impeachment.
RICO indictments maybe ??? 
"Can't even sleep, so excited to see the demise in the A.M. #Cancel.Culture.will.pay"

"Hey Jack, that $10 Million Dollars of share-holders money you just handed away to BLM. Well the three women who run that fake organisation kept it."
Hi Jack. How ya doing little buddy?

This is going to be fun.
"TWTR up 54% in one month. Wow, has that 'triggered' the rotgut filth in the GOPQ. Dorsey is laughing all the way to the Bank. Oh, that's right, he owns Square, a digital financial services Company TOO! LMAO"
This closes Red
OK now going to test 45... sticking with 25 by summer
"I see the war mongering dim bulbs in DC have manipulated the dementia patient into engaging in armed conflict in the Middle East again. How nice. I'm sure the military industrial complex is giddy at the prospect of endless, meaningless wars once again."

anybody going to short this today?
"Twitter is the top most active stock because they’re being sold. It’s really because people had higher expectation for Twitter than FB Amazon we already know those are corrupt, we just did t know Twitter would follow."

its really nice to see investors reject TWTR and Jack Dorsey. restores a tiny piece of the faith in humanity I still have left.
"It's Going Down, I'm Yelling Timberrr!"
"41.00 EOD tomorrow, too many companies and accounts pulling out, This is going down to March numbers."
I've deactivated my Twitter account.
"Twitter, look at the price of this stock and they do nothing. You could buy more than half the stocks on the Dow for less than this. You could also buy a real stock like Coca Cola. What is it Twitter do again? Oh right they advertise stuff, and sell their users information to third-parties. That's their entire business model..."
Did any Republican congressman say impeach the MF when Joe got elected. OH...only a liberal can get by with that. Why can they do and say anything without repercussions? Watch this post will be deleted in a flash.
"I sold my shares and deleted my twitter account. I strongly oppose what the company is doing.However, the stock has significant upside based on valuation to peers and an incoming, friendly administration. Obama stated recently that big tech and government should work closely together. Philosophically, this is a disaster in my mind because I think we are an exceptional country based on our founding principles. If the new administration allows twitter and others to work around our rights when convenient, it will energize almost half the country. I believe TWTR could move to $100+ this year. Count me out regardless. I want no part of what is coming."
Exit before this plummets
"Thanks to the ""ignore bin"", this site becomes less and less a Parler Refugee Camp with each passing day."
"Soooooooo...NASDAQ down .5% and TWTR up 2%....Does that make sense??? Their own guidance says Noooooooo. Hey, the market doesn't always make sense, but something seems foul in the State of Denmark."
Sell this stock. Stand for free speach
markets closed Monday for mlk day. dump twitter now!
Jack Dorsey will be fired again
Twitter is in the toilet. It’s throwing away money to buy this stock.
The Twitter has no freedom of speech so now I don’t use ever I hope it goes bellies up or at least stock tanks if go up its manipulation ( fake) 
"Look at what Germany, India, England, Mexico are saying about twitter. Twitter is on a downward spiral because Jack Dorsey runs his companies based on Ideology not principles. The Securities and Exchange Commission should come down on him for defrauding investors."

"Why are my posts being deleted? Something very, very evil is going on."
FCC going to take control. Like they were suppose to 20 years ago.
where TWTR open on Monday AM? Was trading at -$1.95 to $49.53 after hours Friday.
I know TWTR is down at the moment. Look for a spike today above $50. This is a great entry point after the mild pullback from what will become irrelevant news... GLTA
Imagine owning stock in a social media company that lost billions of dollars in value because they censor people they don't agree with.
Is John Kerry going to ditch his private jets soon?
Do you think Twitter can survive as long as the rioting going on in Portland?
"The ""mouthpiece"" during a coup d'etat on the world's most foremost democracy...Yeah, I'd buy Puts."
I just perma-banned Twitter. So liberating. Feel the power of THE BAN. Feels good man!
"Now the My Pillow Guy - Twitter is off the rails and needs to be STOPPED PERIOD! I hope this company crashes and burns like there is no tomorrow. The ELECTION was stolen - go ahead, ban me yahoo."
Buy Twtr Puts NOW.
They will lose 50% of their subscribers.
"Welp, Facebook just squashed Twitter's dreams!"
"I consider myself a moderate. Leaned left most of my life and now lean slightly right. This latest move by Twitter has even me wanting to leave the platform. If I feel this way, I cannot imagine what actual conservatives are feeling. To me Twitter has signed their death warrant as a social media Giant. It is a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half. Maybe I am completely dead wrong. But I don't think so."
Feb 9th. Mark the date. This will be a mixed earnings report. Why? Because it was near the end of this quarter that Twtr decided to become Totalitarian. People will be confused. They may buy more or sell off. It won’t be until May that you will see the picture start to make sense. At that point investors will be selling.
This is SO MUCH fun. You just KNOW there will be hard data soon about how many MILLIONS of users Jackoff has lost for Twitter! Look out below....!!!
Wish there were 5 days next week for this garbage to fall instead of 4....actual stock holders should have bailed already....think of all the money they will lose in the coming weeks...its unfortunate ur ceo lacks the foresight to see the consequences of his actions...wallet gonna hurt!!!
"Notice The Words In The First Amendment Below Where It Reads Peaceably! Plus How Can Someone Speak Freely When They Are Afraid For Their Safety! Also Freedom Of Speech Does Not Mean You Can Lie and Slander Each Other! We Must Stop Hating Each Other! We Have A Lot More Problems Ahead Of Us! It Is 2021 I Know We Are Smarter Than This!The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition. It forbids Congress from both promoting one religion over others and also restricting an individual’s religious practices. It guarantees freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely. It also guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and to petition their government."
2 years from now Twitter will just be Leftists and blue checkmarks agreeing with eachother.
i dont have any twtr shares or account but i will love to see this baby goes down-6% every day will be niceif you want censorship go to China
How many Twitter users are left??? Left being the ket word. This is not a company but an arm of the DUMBmocratic party. They want cancel half the o#$%$
SELL SELL
"So, I cancelled a week ago now. Honestly, I feel better. It was a good move."
200 contracts on puts! expiration date is 2022. next earnings is gonna be brutal. I still don't have answers how twitter makes earnings. users are leaving by margins on a daily basis
You think Nancy & Chuck will bail social media out in the future because they’re heading bankrupt!!!
No Volume :-(
"To be all honest what do you charge King Neptune with his spear standing in the halls of the Capital with? When compared to the Looters we saw in all major cities over the summer who got charged with nothing but got away with $billions in small business owners inventory? I think if you add the lives lost over the summer tied to the RIOTS. Police lost like 25 members and the damage done in those cities maybe as high as $700 Billion. I do think TWTR leaving the IRAN President's TWTR site active over the President of the Free World is a joke. It's why the Capital Markets will show TWTR what Freedom of Speech means in the U.S.A. Right or Wrong , Democrat or Republican Freedom of Speech will not be controlled by Social Networks in the U.S.A. Those who try to control it, well look at the close of trading on Friday for TWTR!"
Tanking bigly in after hours trades
the Constitution is America
Down 3 percent tomorrow
Dorsey needs to go to rehab
We won We won.
5 billion lawsuit coming lol
Yahoo story on Ashli Babbitt is disgusting. The left wingers regularly try to turn career criminals into martyrs whenever they get shot by police while committing yet another crime - but when an UNARMED 14 year Air Force vet who is conservative gets killed by Capitol police then they present it in a totally different light.

There is a whole other infrastructure being set up or has been put into place. Twitter is nothing more than a dead man walking at this point.

how is twitter still going up??? This stock has been green every single day for literally 3 weeks in a row
short this baby to $60!
"From the Goldman price upgrade:""But some traders think the rally has gone too far. ""The problem is, on a technical basis, it's also getting incredibly overbought,"" Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, told CNBC on Thursday.He noted that the last time the stock's relative strength index moved this high, in mid-2018, Twitter plummeted about 40% in less than six months."""
Just wondering about all of the beloved Twitter investors. Did anyone let you know they would sabotage the company and destroy well over 5 billion in shareholder value? Just wondering why you care about a company that doesn’t care for you? Maybe you are all staying around for the dividend o wait yeah. They most really care about the stock holder.
Say it isn’t so. Alec Baldwin is quitting Twitter in the wake of his own “noose” scandal and his wife’s “Hilaria” scandal.
Looks like Chap 7 is on the way !!!!!!!!
We Love you Rush!
I wish I had a twitter account to delete but I have never had one.
time to open a short position here!
There’s so many terrible things happening and I can’t talk to anyone about it.
Anti trust civil rights violated. Sell! Who can hold this in good conscience. No longer free speech. Twitter has taken a side dividing the country.
Been holding Twitter for over 5 years. Seen everything bad and good. But not selling.. Go Twitter! Finally free trumpster gone!!! Great 
getting ripped on fbn right now. Cancel culture economics. Only targeting conservative. Price target $0.0
And how are our little Twitter snowflakes holdin’ up during the Twitter rout.
This is the most un American company out there. It is now toxic and I’m glad I no longer own it.
I hope Twitter falls back to $20/ share before February 2021.
Conservatives MUST cancel libbys....MUST...who gives a da%$ what these libbys think or have to say.....
How will TWTR do when Markets correct even 5%? LMAO
"$PINS valuation has a lot of room to run. Compare $PINS mkt cap (55B) to $SNAP (96B), Airbnb $ABNB (129B), $DASH (71B), or $SPOT (68B). The big 3 $FB, $TWTR, and $GOOG face political/regulatory headwinds, and $AMZN is probably going to get scrutiny too. $PINS stands to benefit."
Ban half of the users and Twitters next quarter earnings will be more interesting.
"Where does Bjorn fall in the community of those who are perpetually light in the loafers? Look up the meaning of the name ""Bjorn"" in English. It means ""bear"". Lucky for him he's at the top of THAT food chain. The first two letters of his name are a dead giveaway too."
ahhh the value of socialism
I sold my last share and gout out with a $18 profit. Haha. TWTR will start to drop when their earnings report comes out. This is not an investment but rather a black hole.
"Twitter stock losing steam, smart money is exiting as fast as they can"
I mean seriously who in their right mind is buying at this price? This stock was $20 in March. It wasn't even worth that much then.
Twitter is the thing in the past. Good luck everyone!!
Yahoo is censoring comments lmao they deleted my post already which was merely my opinion about this stock... it’s truly sad what big tech has come to... it’s unbelievable violation of freedom of speech
Literally had just posted a comment about media controlling the message with Kamala Harris’ comments about allowing and encouraging riots to continue and how Twitter and Big Tech is doing the same to us. It was gaining traction and had 13-1 positive votes in less than 5 min and guess what? POOF!! It’s gone. Yahoo is part of the censorship problem. What a joke.
"FUNDS are unloading today to retail and other WOKE Funds, Mark Mobius said this morning on FBN that European Regulators will be investigating TWTR'S Censorship of Conservative speech, and that TWTR will most likely themselves be heavily regulated in EUROPE going forward.He hinted that Funds will be unloading their holdings going forward, and he would not be a buyer now or in the future of TWTR."

Duck twitter. I deactivated myself from that communist ship hole. Next is amazon. canceling my sub after I receive the series I watch from ebay. I'll pay more but I won't support #$%$ Jeff.
lets see if the liberal politicians donate money to twitter when it goes down
A very smart liberal friend of mine who enjoyed leaving negative replies to Trumps tweets said Twitter is violating his constitutional right to communicate with his government. Think about that- censorship cuts both ways. Wasn't it after all a court that ruled Trump cant ban people from his twitter because it violates their constitutional rights?
"suppression, in any form, is not a winning business model for a communication tool."
Trying Parler now
Dow up because of oil. NASDAQ down because it is overvalued...for the moment...especially Twister.
seems even blocking free speech isn't enough to make people value their self respect and get out of twitter
You dont have to have a Twitter account to be an injured party.
"HUD, I must admit two things right up front:- I’ve never posted on this TWTR before, and- I was duly impressed with your perspective!!If I may, I would like to add just one additional consideration:Someday (hopefully soon) America will realize that these platforms are just 21st Century Utilities and need to be regulated as such.Think not - Standard Oil, AT&T, the Baby Bells, Microsoft et al were viewed as abusive to the public interest. BUT EVEN MORE RELEVANT the Public Utilities cannot turn you off for your political views - why shouldn’t these fundamental consumer services not be subject to similar oversight? And, oh by the way, Al Gore invented the internet upon which they have built their businesses!!"
"If you are planing a trip to Washington, DC ,I would reconsider..The DC city council just voted to reduce their police department by 25% and release from prison convicted felons who served at least 10 years of their sentence....What could possibly go wrong...."

$58 - $62 range says the chart
prepare for long squeeze
Sell orders on this ticker might slug the system tomorrow!
Whatever a person’s political viewpoint is censoring free speechIs something we ALL need to fight for.Cancel Twitter accounts and fight for all our free speech.People have rights NOT ONLY tech companies
Better have your orders in to dump this stock first thing Monday. This thing is going to tank by atleast 30%. I have seen so many people deactivate their accounts. Bye bye AD dollars.
Ten percent pop tomorrow IA
"I believe Twitter will fail, due to their own arrogance."
Parler found a server. I personally like GAB but will support any social media that supports free speech and dissent of any kind. MAGA
Twatter trying to make America a one system government. Where’s the freedom in that?
I really hope this goes to zero
TWTR up again tomorrow. You can see it coming!
Sell for parts

The shorts have TWTR in their hands and won't let go for very long.
Parler boys said they were going to bankrupt Twitter.
"I just got suspended by Youtube for expressing my opinions which someone flagged for review and didn't like. Have been with them for many years and nothing like this ever happened. Didn't post any outright ""hateful"" things just the truth in a polite manner. Maybe it's a good thing because I may have been spending too much time posting on their site. Have cancelled my Facebook account many years ago because I came to the conclusion that I don't need to ""friend"" people just for the sake of ""friending"" people. I like my privacy and have no desire to re-connect with people from my past and give day by day reports as to what I'm doing with my life. Was never on Twitter at all and have no intention to being on there."
"Twtr interfered in the presidential election. Soon there will be a court trial for a great excess of power, which means a lot of money for the aggrieved party"

"CEO John Matze posted to the Parler platform on Sunday sparking rumors that the site will be brought back online imminently. The message, dated January 16, suggests the social network found a new cloud hosting platform, after Parler was booted from Amazon Web Services."
Down she goes
Contact every website that has twitter and facebook on their site and tell them you are not doing business with them until they remove facebook and twitter from their business website! If you shop at a store leave your cart when they tell you they have facebook and twitter on their website.

Whats Joe Bidens favorite ice cream?
Twitter is not only overvalued it is sinking to new lows and may not survive as cancellations are at a record level. Ad revenue will collapse as sponsors realize the audience is diminishing. If you are smart you will get out now while there is still some value left. Now before the real losses mount.
I have joined the party and left #twitter #deactivate #sellstock

"Dorsey talks from both sides of his mouth, tells Uganda they must promote free speech, and Uganda banned Twitter from interfering in their election. Yet Dorsey banned half his US customers for their free speech. India also banning TWTR Dorsey, they see him as an impediment to free speech!"
"When social media companies limit free speech, then the smart thing is to stop using them! Just go back to using your phone and actually call someone and talk. You get to hear their voice and laugh with them and it's much more fun and personal. Ditch these companies that want to limit free speech and control the flow of ideas and thought that they disagree with. At this rate we dont have to worry about the Russians or the Chinese meddling in our personal affairs, you've got these multibillion social media companies that are doing a much better job at it!!"
"Does anyone know how to join the coming class action lawsuits against TWTR? Every lawyer in America must be frothing at the mouth ready to file class actions and anti trust lawsuits against APPL, TWTR, AMXN, and GOOG right now. The Board of Directors need to step in and take action on behalf of the shareholders being bent over becasue of management's actions. AMZN has clearly demonstrated they are a monopoly or belong to a group of monopolies in the cloud & infrastructure hosting arena. Not to mention, they are definitely in breach of contract with Parler. There is no way IN HELL AMZN will be able to justify breaking their Parler contract without allowing Parler to first offload to another provider. Can you imagine the lawsuit coming AMXN's way on this? And for what? Just to pound their liberal drum a little louder?"
TWTR along with other tech colluders with the CCP are going to be taken down as per the EO trading in public companies that have been deemed to have colluded with the CCP has to cease as of 11/11/21.

"Jack Dorsey when Twitter is Bankrupt, What happened ??"
Twitter suspended the Gateway Pundit account again on Tuesday for another week for violating the “civic integrity” rules.This is a new Orwellian category that allows Twitter to ban any conservative at will.
"TWTR another 52 week high coming this week!! After Due Diligence on ACRX went long, ACRX 450% upside based on analyst reports... At least put ACRX on your watch list - hint ARMY, AIR FORCE, NAVY, COAST GUARD... Also buying $FB on this dip"
Btw. Sold. Made $26k. Thanks.No donation to Big-o-Lardo. Not a “Patriot’
I just don't see the price as anything other than artificially inflated at this point.
Someone just dumped 400k+ shares.
Not one of the Patriots that showed up last Wednesday was burning the American Flag as apposed to the BLM mob that was burning old glory all summer long. Which team would you rather be on? Enough said.
Twitter was just about dead when President Trump threw them a life line in 2015 by tweeting out directly to the public. 88 million people Jack #$%$ Dorsey/ Twitter slapped in the face. I am canceling my Twitter account and I will wait for Parlor to resurface. Jack#$%$ Dorsey is not as smart as he thinks he is. Twitter will be back to 2015 level of customers soon so now is the time to Short Twitter.

Wish I could have stayed one more day with Twitter! But I made a hefty 36%! Good luck to all true Americans who still hold Twitter stock!

Now down 3%.........................

"Twitter lost over 1.1B in the trailing 12 months. They made money in two of the last 4 quarters. They're at their peak and the stock price reflects future growth, not a good combination.At the very best (from their perspective), the FANG companies have now opened up a huge demand for competing products. That goes for Amazon and Facebook, and to a lesser extent Google and Apple. They all just created tens of millions (perhaps more) who will jump ship to any halfway decent competing products. Gab, Telegram, Rumble all surging. There is a huge opportunity for prepared investors here to fill the void."

How can a man get away with breaking the First Amendment of the Constitution like Moses slammed down the Ten Commandments? At least Moses was responding to his people falling into idolatry. @Jack is trying to run the world by censorship and manipulation of the public narrative. ILLEGAL..."
COME ON 'E REDS!
"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."

Love to watch the slide. The hivemind is dying. All of the little commie investors in this company. Are getting a hard lesson in capitalism. They love to protest and cancel so long as it does not affect their pocketbook. Their virtue signaling and embrace of cancel culture is starting to backfire.

When Twitter locks you out they don't allow you to deactivate your account. This artificially inflates the actual number of user count so as not to alarm advertisers and affect the Twitter stock price. NOT WORKING!
I have a $50000 bet that this is trading at $20 in a year.

"Osama Bin Dorsey says SELL, SELL, SELL, than short all you can right here !!!!"
"Wow, only a $9.86 book value. This stock is way overpriced imo."
"If Twitter has a right as argued by some, to delete and silence and not allow certain speech or people on the site, why doesnt a bakery or a photographer or caterer have the right NOT to work with certain groups?"
Twitter lost its status.. Better invest in Toyota.
how is this going back up after millions of people dumped it?
Any true investor capitalist should be concerned in multiple companies coordinating in anticompetitive business practices. Supreme Court definitely gonna break these guys up.
Wikileaks just released the Clinton emails. Dorsey isn't the only to pay for his horrific anti-American acts.
"The thing is, Twitter and Facebook are selling your PERSONAL INFORMATION to anyone who will give them money. Aren't you afraid? I know I am. That's where the data leaks begin, that's where the fraud begins, that's where someone steals your id. Just who has your information now? You don't know. No one does. Twitter and Facebook sold you."
"There’s about to be some BIG CHANGES coming down the pike for not only Twitter but $FB as well. These online platforms, along with others, have PROFITED off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of MISINFORMATION among Americans that has caused HATE AND DIVISION within our country. They’re platforms are being used as tools to organize MASS RIOTS all over the US. I’ve been against FB and Twitter from the very beginning. It was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be SHUTDOWN. There is very little, if anything, “social” about them."
Wait until the Reddit crew gets here. The cult will burn like fat on the barbie.
everyday it goes down another dollar....
I hope any investor knows that Twitter has MILLIONS of fake account. Most major profiles at least half are fake - you used to be able to BUY users. Twitter was going to delete ALL fake users until they realized how many FAKE users there were and that a small fraction of users actually used the service. Twitter LIES about the number of users.
late day pumping beginning at 3:30. Don't fall for it
"TWTR thrives on controversy and open discussion. Without it, REAL QUESTION, what is its value?"
"best news I've heard all day... ""Parler sues Amazon, leveling far-fetched antitrust allegations"".... hopefully Twitter is sued too"
broke key support and stop loss trigger at 46$ for a lot
"JUST one simple question to ASK: Why risk your hard-earned money on this fast-loosing-user TWTR stock? There are so many good stocks / ETFs to make money, SELL TWTR! SELL TWTR! BUY ARKK/ARKW/ARKQ/ARKG!!"
I just don't understand why it's down 10%... and not 50%.
"Hold the line today, it will fly high next week"
"Politics aside, this company still isn’t profitable and it’s usership has already peaked. What a scam. They had over a $1B loss this year in net earnings in what has been a record year for social media useage due to the pandemic and it still has almost a $40B valuation. OUCH. (You all should buy this stock, maybe it will only lose $950M next year)."
release nancys laptop we want to see
Start selling at the open of the market.
Leftist Kara Swicher on CNBC now praising Twitter and trashing PARLER....supports the crushing of free speech because if you are on Parler you MUST BE plotting violence....
The man didn't even campaign from the basement. The media campaigned for him.
Bidet is doing a helluva job reuniting the countryLOL
"The LACK of traditional values and morals in ""America"" will be the demise of freedom, liberty, and our founding documents."
Twitter should change their name to Knotzee Book Burners R Us
This is just the beginning Take it down to 5 buck Chuck..
Pinterest already has almost triple the number of users that Twitter has. Twitter went public in 2013 and Pinterest went public in 2019 - but Pinterest has blown by Twitter and is headed for FaceBook numbers in hurry.
"people are leaving.. twitter is dying, get out before it's too late..."
Everybody loves the sunshine
The new stimulus check is Shorting Twitter!
CLEARLY the new socialist party in power and corporations that support censorship are supporting the stock today. It will not work. TWTR is doomed!
Huge insider dumps coming greed Libs watching their net worth shrinking!
This is absolutely beautiful! Patriotism wins every time! Hedge funds dumping TWTR and FB due to legal instability!
"communist social media dropping like a dead fly, love to see it!"
"I see no upside for this stock , for months or maybe years."
Never shorted a stock until now
Twitter trending topic: Twitter.
Twitter business model...the sound of one hand clapping 
"Of the first 13 arrested in Capitol Hill unrest, zero had Parler accounts. The vast majority of planning or discussion of heading to Capitol Hill took place on Facebook and YouTube. Google owns YouTube so they can’t possibly block their own site. Big Tech must be sanctioned, financially penalized and broken up in a way that this never happens again. Imagine if these tech companies were based in China and had banned our President. Wouldn’t we ALL be standing unitedly against it?https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9131977/amp/Parler-squeezed-Trump-seeks-new-online-megaphone.html"
There's no justice in the world.
Imagine investing in a stock where the owner is a Feminine pencil neck geek who wears a little nose ring. Embarrassing Embarrassing
Dorsey is the king!!!!
No upward movement. Could the 20 million accounts have switched over to Parler?
"Since peaking at 69, there does not seem to be 1 buy order."
"Europe and other countries are horrified by this since it shows a US tech company can decide to control their speech too. They are seeking alternatives where they have control. Ironically, China already does this. Stock will drop a lot further when users around the world slowly drop off when alternative start up."
Twitter up $28.00 since January. you the man Dorsey
Something about twitter's outrageous business success gets sad people who believe insane conspiracy theories all worked up.
"I just got rid of my fingers so I can't use Twitter. Also, I quit my job and donated all my money to charity, so I can't buy anything from Amazon."
"Mark my words, 30c on the otc markets in 6-months. The shorts are taking you down Jackie boy."
"Just pulled this from an article published today from Tipbanks:Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz believes that the ban could pose significant hurdles to the company’s 2021 mDAUs (monetizable daily active users) and ad revenue “on top of already tough COVID user compares,” which he estimates added about 3 million and 15 million incremental US and outside US mDAUs (estimated), respectively, last year.Zgutowicz further stated that his scenario analyses indicated that the ban could wipe off 6 million-9 million US mDAUs this year. The analyst argued that the move, along with tough COVID-induced user growth comparables, leave the company a “little room to deliver positive ’21 results.” The analyst reiterated a Hold rating on Twitter and lowered his price target slightly to $39 from $40."
February 9 is doomsday for Twitter. Let?s see if they can #$%$ their way out of their earnings.
"Oh oh, red is on the horizon..."
The RSI is outrageously high on this stock. 10% correction imminent
"Twitter is a dead man walking now. The videos of Jack saying how he was going purge conservatives from the platform, put the final nails in the coffin."
Watch for a flood of shareholder lawsuits against Twitter as the stock price continues to drop. The reason for the decrease is executive mismanagement.
Next share holders will sue TWTR for lost money.
"$10 Billion gone, I don't think BLM will be getting handed $10 Million this year."
Twitter now exposed! China had been exposed.
Confirmed Head and Shoulders on the 5 I'll be donating half my Winnings to bail funds for Proud Boys
"As it continues to slide, I plan on buying if it hits $10/share."
"We should be happy that, for now, Chairman Xiden hasn't nominated Caitlyn Jenner for the dollar bill."
You don't want to be holding this when the market opens. This is plunging today.
It’s not over till it’s over - “ we’ve just begun “Tuesday another 1-3% down 12 months of decline sounds great  Deactivate accounts - all biz and personal Sell and short this anti American company
"Yagoo shadow banning is happening.... posts are not appearing, but when you click on your own feed the post appears"
You investors in Twitter stock need to see the writing on the wall. Stock may be artificially held up but not for long. People ( Democrats and Republicans) that believe in free speech are leaving. There is no hope. Stock will be 20 by the end of February.
"What you saw this early AM was a tremor. There is only so much propping up the donors can do to fulfill their clandestine pact. Even G. Soros, DNC, etc..Built a house on sand, eventually, it will fall.Want all to make money, up or down, be careful!"
I feel that Germany now a has more of a better grasp on freedom of speech than we do.
"So many emotional, broke bums who think they got it all figured out Twitter is headed to the moon"
"Congrats to all longs for holding strong. Glad to see the boycott cult have only made this stronger. Have to admit, I was a little nervous, but clearly they are not the ones using Twitter. Twitter is a lot more peaceful now "
"I am outraged. I am canceling my cable. Over 1,000 channels and I still can't find anything to watch, well except for Newsmax."
So it begins!
"The government owns the internet and these big exploiting it to suppress the constitutional rights of people...Time to shut down big tech, they are funded by taxpayers...time for them to pay us back with their multibillion dollar profit.. ++++++++1"
"If MLK had a dream & he tweeted it, that too would be censored."
I just deactivated my account 40k followers. I’ll look into the gab app.
This stock is going to break out and then break down. So happy I bought oil when it was negative.
"Lets see, Twitter has negative earnings, never had positive earnings, now alienated or deleted 75 million of their customers... good luck with that."
Big tech will have a blood week come monday. Twitter FB Apple google ... drag down with it the nasdaq points. Even the left traders know it's coming. Massive exit coming.
Deleted my account. Sold my shares! No way would i buy again with @jack at helm!
Was in the industry for years. This is a classic pump and dump. Don't be left holding.
Gasoline just blew thru $3.00 a gallon on it's way to $4.00..The next recession will be caused by a senile old man in the White House....
"TWTR is sooooo betterererer than all of the NASDAQ. For a month straight. Duh, right?!Nothing to see, here, folks. Move along!"
Hey Jack... Why did you give BLM $10 Million of shareholders money?
Many of my posts are being deleted. Read reply to this post.
So the dems have1. all media outlets2. Big Tech3. Wall Street4. Absentee ballotsSo what do Republicans have?
"twitter chased off a lot of conservatives to another place, then blocked that place only after they had closed their twitter account. how do you like them apples!"
If the American people are upset and want to protest & or riot ( not condoning ) based on the law makers & their decision wouldn’t it be most appropriate to actually go to the source rather than loot & destroy your own cities & neighborhoods? Further more I’ll never understandstand why stealing new sneakers is the way!!
Turn it beet RED....
"I think Twitter is by design a hateful ‘ website’ , because that is all it is... a website! a system designed to use people against people."
"I just cancelled my $TWTR, $FB accounts. They are communist."
"Telegram now has over 500M users and over 25M new ones in the past 3 days. Gab has been adding servers and adding ~500K users per day. WhatsApp (Facebook) and Twitter seem to have sown the wind, now they will reap the whirlwind."
"Follow the 5 year trend line, why would it do anything different after the last earnings report"
United states of Venezuela. coming soon!
The Communist Leftards love Twitter
if you like it at $48 you'll love it at $18.
jack
this news fundamentally isnt any plausible reason for pump. all they are saying is that they will increase revenue by adding more features. how do you know some other app might come out and eat up market share? how do you know the added features will add new users as they say? instagram created that feature thats similar to tiktok that didnt boost fb price sky high like this? i think people are ganging up in here because theyre tired of the market managers turning february into an extremely bearish month.
The 5 year low is just under $14.00 Make it $5.00...
"I cancelled my $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts."
The only way we're ever going to have a fair election is if we use Ivanka's Chinese-patented Voting Machines and all the votes are tabulated at Big-o-Lardo. Bigly. Believe me.MAGA - Meltdowns Are Gaining Acceleration
User duck duck go browser. They don't follow your usage and monetize you like big brother google does.
I got rid of mine today for $51.06 picked it up 10 days ago for $45 picked up 12% in 10 days. Figure I’ll repurchase some next week in the $45 range again and repeat.
"Evil company. Let's bring this company down. In American, TWTR, FB, AMZN, APPL, GOOG, these big tech companies are censoring people. Evil. Just cannot believe this is happening in America."
time to show Dorsey who is the boss
Cult45 this morning!
"SELL $FB, $TWTR, $GOOGL, $AMZN, $AAPL THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN"
Deleted my twitter account this morning. The communists can have it. I really won't miss it.

Dumping all $TWTR and $FB stocks. Censorship=communism. No thank you.
"Up again? Sorry, I bought cover already"
"Congrats to $TWTR management on the 'Hope and Change' targets! Well played pump.Of course they have been a publically traded company since Nov, 2013 (8 years) with a business model that has not brought them fame, fortune or riches. Forward looking statement seem to help more than the business model recently. Again, well played for the pump."
This is a easy short! No brainer 38.00 easy
Sorry I haven't been around a lot this week guys been busy shorting $TWTR (be careful)Long $HVBTF
Will be a sinking ship getting out now
can't wait for Monday morning!
Why hasn’t Jack Dorsey been arrested for lying under oath about Twitter’s censorship policies?
"Despite the clear conflict of interest, the White House did not commit to a recusal by Yellen when asked about it by a Reuters reporter."
Taking out the stop-losses now...
Not one good reason to get in or stay in...I'm out.
Insider dump coming! user growth shrinking!
todays price does not matter as the quarter numbers even if good are the last ones that even come close to being a profitable company. going forward will be substantially lower and loses even larger.
Soros won’t be able to prop this up much longer... circling the drain!
"MLK preached unity, Twitter represents division. Not a single left wing person or group has complained about censorship."
"It could certainly happen today, but I think the chances are it will happen later this week. I'm talking about the bottom falling out of this. A quick drop under 44 and this stock is ready to drop a LOT of money..."
I will do everything in my power this year to get my friends to move to another conservative alternative from Twitter and FB. Their censorship is outrageous.
Made lots of money on the 120 60.00 March 19 puts this morning. Still holding 55.0 s this piece of (:!? Will be at 35.00 by March 19 21 like I said!

"story out about kitten AOC having to dodge snipper fire. no details, no questions. PTSD?"
I will not use Twitter! American does not need Twitter anymore.Give us freedom!
"Up 2% already... congrats to all the longs and people like me who bought at 46 yesterday. Easiest money I have ever made. Trumpsters are so easy to manipulate, thank you for that. As they sold yesterday more institutions bought. I see today closing at 3% and tomorrow at 5%, either way I am already up 8% and will make more. This is nice though for a change! Usually I am paying MAGAts welfare checks, but today they're paying me! You guys owe me over 4 years of welfare checks so Keep the money coming!"
Divest Twitter from your 401K
"Scroll back up to restore default view.Yahoo FinanceFacebook and Twitter largely 'culpable for all the harm, all the hate, all the death' in Capitol attack: former Obama adviserDaniel HowleyDaniel Howley·Technology EditorThu, January 7, 2021, 5:54 PM EST·4 min readFacebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), and other social media sites should be held accountable for helping to stoke the divisiveness that led to Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol, according to a former Obama adviser who has also worked for Facebook."
Ok time to bring this down to $40.00. Burn twitter burn.
I wonder if the CCP Flag will be flown during the successful Coup operation ceremony.
thanks to the big guy gasoline just blasted thru $3.00 a gallon on it's way to $4.00....
"Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO: “We are focused on one account [@realDonaldTrump] right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account, and it’s going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week, and the next few weeks, and go on beyond the inauguration.”I don't think Jack and his twitts have to worry.. 99% of the voluntarily cancelled their accounts.."
Censorship does not pay. I guess Twitter going to learn the hard way.
More antitrust lawsuits coming for these 2 commie companies. $FB $TWTR
Limp wrist Dorsey and his embarrassing nose ring are about to get hammered worse than he’s ever known. This isn’t China Jacky boy! Censoring politicians in America is not a good look!
now they bring in thousands of national guard before they demonized them and the police. This is a joke.These large companies have too much power and are hurting everyday Americans. I hope this stock falls big time.
Sell Sell Sell! No money to be made here.
Today tells you folks value money over freedom
US economy is about to crash folks. Short TWTR.
Bye bye
"Twitter is very unpopular amongst teenagers. Now the company is self sabotaging itself, will lose a million+ active users this year. RIP future growth"
"How can these Demoncrats look at the pictures of Hunter and the little girls, and pass that off as okay? How can they continue to deny the strong documentary evidence that Hunter and Joe were on the fiddle in Ukraine?"
I personally don't care to take sides on the election or any other topic folks are going on about. But when a company takes away the freedom of speech ALL Americans are affected. What they did is basically Communistic censorship. It cannot be tolerated by any American as we ALL will suffer. These are difficult times that I hope we get through quickly but Twitter has done nothing but divide us further. I have cancelled by account and I truly hope they fail. This cannot be tolerated at any level.
"Glad I shorted yesterday! Let's keep it going.........down, down, down! LOL Wait until the market starts going down then watch how fast and hard Twitter falls, and it's coming, it's definitely coming!"
I am realy annoyed that my stop Loss got triggered last afternoon.
Twitter is the protector of American & the whole world. They really keep an eye on whats going on. Twitter is our best defense
"Was a Financial Principal of a NASD firm. Do not be surprised that the assumption TWTR will collapse Monday doesn't happen to the degree it should. The bad news is money will be pouring in to support the price of the stock. The good news is the SEC has the buyer information that can be traced back to the monies who purchased the stock. Also, the NASDQ should collapse based on their many abuses of our freedoms. Again don't be surprised if it initially doesn't happen."
"Who remembers ""NOT MY PRESIDENT""?"
"Somebody get Jack a subscription to the Dollar Shave Club, please!"
I blocked all the advertising on twitter anyway.. It took up way too much space on the feed.. They were going to fail eventually..
Just cancelled Apple TV+ subscription due to there action on Parlor
"Go to the duckduckgo search engine and start to type ""how to delete"". The first 4 autocomplete suggestions are how to delete your Facebook account, Twitter account, Instagram account, and Gmail account LOL."
nothing said or done about BLM riots that's ok speech- well it's ok then to cancel TWTR accounts too--cancel culture is going to find out canceling can go both ways
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but Twitter has lost about 5-10 billion in market cap in a week."
"Bottom line the user retention rate and new user rates will be down dramatically. The less eyes on the platform the less ad revenue. There is a direct correlation. A Self inflicted wound. As large institutional holders continue too unwind their positions heading into earnings, law firms are putting together their class action lawsuits. The gap down on earnings during the after hours will likely be dramatic. Hilarity will ensue "
Time for a class action lawsuit against Twitter for blocking millions from Free Speech?
There is a new play playing out in the capital today. It is vey funny to see everyone trying to outdo each other for the most attention of the press. These people are drama queens of the liberals.
This company is communism lite. Do not buy. Sell. Sell. Sell
"We deleted FB, Twitter months ago!"
"i sold all my TWTR this morning. sold fb last week. I keep very little aapl instead of huge amount, same to amzn."

twtr is falling off the cliff due to retaliation from withdrawing President Trump account...caused millions of subscribers withdraw their account with twtr as well ...too bad to hold for long term investment...most likely gonna be very bad commimg quarter e/r....
So Apple is rethinking its decision to remove Parler!!Hmmmm!
ESAD Jack.
Dorsey thinks the North Korean model is what's best.
Hey there bagholders. The elevator had stopped for a moment. Last chance to exit.

"Just wait until the class action lawsuits come out. Then, you'll have a company that already doesn't make money, with a shrinking subscriber base, and a bunch of legal fee expenses and/or fines."
When Jim Cramer says that TWTR stock is going to be $100.00. it's going to be $ 100. IA. you better believe it . Load it up
Easy 20-25% decline from here. If Knives gets fall and I won’t catch it till it’s at 10...Or very attractive single digits
"Told to get Out of twitter and facebook, sell off monday"

"Has anyone else noticed whats going on in Portland....People are beginning to run over "" peaceful protestors "" with their cars..."
Delete your Twitter and Facebook accounts immediately. Only way to send a message to big tech.
When shareholders have to file a lawsuit to stop the CEO from making decisions on his own...great company!
I wonder when the panic selling starts
Putin loves tweeter.
CRAMER says BUY in a dip. You won't be able to get a better dip than this. LOAD it up

"If you're a patriot, and you care about freedom of the press. then deactivate your Twitter account now. Facebook and Amazon must also cancelled.."
"Twitter: “We think that the severity of what’s happening on the ground, coupled with the information that’s contained in these [election fraud] tweets — misleading information about the election being stolen and massive fraud around the election are what is changing our analysis of how we should enforce this [civic integrity] policy. It [election fraud tweets] is a much more severe violation given what we were seeing on the ground.”"
Take it to $45 today
Lots of “short at $45” here. Hope $3 helped the burn. Take it to Texas. They need the heat.
haha now its going the right way! people have finally opened eyes!
"This premarket activity is interesting. WHY would anyone buy into a company that has deeply offended half its user base, and is shedding millions of users daily since their unprecedented actions of silencing a sitting US PRESIDENT and others?As an investor it makes zero sense to be involved with mess.Good luck"
Can't wait to see Donnie on trialin the senate and in the federal and state courts.
"The Capitol Police has more than 2000 officers and an annual budget of $500 million, all to patrol 2 square miles of land. We don't need permanent fencing around the seat of US democracy. We need them to do their job.The EOs coming out of Washington are not what Americans want."
Jack I hear you have a new girlfriend these days. what a team!@!!!!~
MBA courses around the country will now use Twitter as an example of a business sham that was never really ever about returning shareholder value.
Just another Liberal analyst Holding this up so his company can bail out...
Ditch the electoral college thinks he/she has troops in Europe.....
"Hungary now warning TWTR, FB . Recommending EU action. Crush the techno-fascist oligarchs from Silicon Valley."
This company is a dog waiting to die. They are propping it up as much as possible but when earnings comes out it's going to be a catastrophe don't wait around for the big red candles. they are going to have to explain to shareholders what the hell they were thinking? the trouble is there is no explanation for their communist censorship Behavior
"I can’t wait for the day when Twitter, Facebook, instagram and snapchat go bankrupt and close down! They are extremely toxic to any civilized society. Breed nothing but hatred."

The discourse on twitter all of a sudden is substantive and reality-based. Users love it. Great business decisions have been made over the past month.
"looking at $25 by the time china Joe is sworn in , rice for all my peeps"
I like Twitter:
"Sold. Win or lose, principles are important. This stock deserves to tank."

"QUESTION- Is it an act of treason for a high ranking elected official to render financial assistance, encouragement and public endorsement of anarchists charged with the felonious crimes of rioting, the destruction of private and public property, looting and arson? On June 1, 2020 Vice President elect tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota.""In a few days Harris will be one heartbeat away from becoming the POTUS, which is a chilling reality. We the people must DO something about this dreadful situation. Immediately, contact your House Representative and insist that they draft articles of impeachment based upon Harris' own words.

The little blue bird is down substantially in after hours trading. This market closes at 8 pm. Better sell immediately before it drops even further. Tomorrow will be a brutal day for Big Tech companies like Twitter.
Good point by one of the posters. The support will come from horrifics who support the socialist/marxist/globalist cabal. Won't last long as there are more of us than them.

The ill-fated leader said vaccine just around the corner, and it's true - vaccine now a reality under his regime. All good stuffs. But the ill-fated leader never realized that people was the boss not him. His many misdeeds broke his wheel of success and people fired him , never valued his achievements. The ill-fated leader was the architect of his own destruction."
Illusion if you think this is going to stay up. Democrats and Republicans and conservatives will be running from Twitter. This is just the beginning.

"Subscribers going down is very bad news for an ad-driven revenue model. Their ""inventory"" of impressions generated by traffic will be down big, which means lower revenue per ad. This is just economics--as revenue per ad goes down, they need to sell more ads but they won't have the inventory--there's only so many ""eyeballs"" you can sell. Imagine Apple having to lower prices on iphones, but not having more iphones to sell--they could make more; how will Twitter generate more traffic? If tens of millions of subscribers have deactivated, how do you get more subscribers to join? This is a death spiral, folks."

Don’t be known as “doing a Dorsey”.

I’m thinking there’s a disconnect if people are going to be asked to have a degree to work the point of sale. It makes Twitter marketing and only fans look more lucrative. If you’re going to buy a house, you can’t do it with some gop offering you $10 an hour for a register job. Minimum wage at $20,000. If rent is 600, and food is 200 a week, you’re out of money."

"Stock quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good"

Who cares what total strangers think about anything? Unless you are a sad sad ,am who cannot find a girlfriend in real life. Find something else which works for your family and REAL friends (not strangers) use that instead. Seriously delete Twitter."
15 more minutes and the US is a vassal state of the CCP. The TWTR oligarchs shall rule you with the iron thumb of censorship.

The new twitter is Yahoo finance forums.
"Reading Babbitt’s Instagram one could think her husband and mother just wanted to split the AF pension and go to Cabo. It doesn’t appear they thought very much of her, didn’t try and get her help, psychiatry, deprogramming. In the 80s and 90s parents would pay $20K to have their kids deprogrammed from the Moonies and Krishna cults. Because they loved their kids. They didn’t point at their insta feeds and say Oh Well"
very pleased. jack dorsey is definitely making twitter great again.
HMS Twitter approaching the iceberg
"Wow, as millions cancel their accounts, just how low will this dog with flees really go?"

"Any wondering if our own GRUnt TEXAS is that tweety Facebook mayor Tim Boyd? Sure sounds like the same tx sized mo-ron “Let me hurt some feelings while I have a minute!!"" Mr Boyd said in his post. ""No one owes you are [sic] your family anything; nor is it the local government's responsibility to support you during trying times like this! Sink or swim it's your choice! The City and County, along with power providers or any other service owes you NOTHING!!”The best part was a boil water advisory issued by the town, which has no electric service or water. Boyd had no thoughts on how residents should boil any water they do find without utilities."

Antitrust lawsuits are getting ready to be filed against Twitter and other big tech stocks. What do you see the short term and long term impacts of these suits being on the stock price?
Twitter longs - you were warned repeatedly that this would gap down at some point. You have not seen the gap down yet - this is just the begginning. It will not be long before you will be wishing you could go back and sell at these levels. This literally may be a single digit stock real soon.
The Industrial Revolution happened with almost play by play mirror image as this big tech revolution is happening. In the history of the industrial revolution 100% of the leaders of that circumstance are now considered evil men. Supporters of Twitter are very short sighted.

All capital markets are doomed in ones controlled by socialists. We know this thus why are you here? Why are you even invested in any of these bloated equity stock issues that can't survive in Socialism .

"Twitter has been flawless in putting in place the CCP insidious, anti democratic policies. Soon they’ll be passing out Mao’s red books....."
just so you guys know twitter had two previous quarters WITH profit. snap is losing money. snap touts they have more daily users. guess what? twitter revenue is higher than snap revenue every quarter. if snap is so great how come they have less revenue while having more daily users??? aside from that twitter is profitable. snap is not. and on top of all this snap market cap is nearly twice that of twitter all while having less revenue than twitter and not being profitable as twitter is? how does this make sense?!

"I wish Twitter would go broke. I can't stand Jack Dorsey! democrats seem to love the word ""collusion"" but see no issues with Twitter, Facebook, Google and Amazon colluding to take down anyone they want for any reason which always includes ""taking out competition"". But the democrats see no issue with that. I don't think any of those four companies would have the balls to do it to Joe Biden or any democratic affiliation. The democrats will always protect those four. ALWAYS!"
I had 46 twitter accounts.. 45 fake and one real.. Cancelled all of them and now I have just one on Parler..

"There should be a class action suit against CNN. John Sullivan left activist was with Jade Sacker of CNN inside the Capitol before the rioters and he is on tape encouraging them to riot. As they come through the front door she says on videotape we did it. No you, we did and gives him a hug. Who knew about the plot to spark the riot. That led to Twitter blaming the President and removing his account, which set off a fire storm of Big Tech and free speech leading to the incredible drop in this stock. This is a huge story about CNN involvement."
Come on 'e Reds...
Big money bringing you in saying safe and cheap. Then the shorts will drop the hammer as institutional investors bail out. Be smart. Twit deleted millions of accounts. They will not come back. A generation gone. You think there is a future? It’s over. It will now be an echo chamber of movie stars doing selfies and politicians talking to nobody who believes them. The party is over and Jack doesn’t care about the investors only about his handlers. CHINA ￼￼

"TWTR is not going to survive this. SELL NOW while you can make a profit. I've noticed as more consumers (the 75 million conservatives) bail out on twitter, their advertisers are porno and ""as seen on TV"" type advertisers. Quality advertisers are leaving because they know the consumers who are staying with twitter are not the target $ quality consumers. SELL TWTR or you'll be left with worthless stock. How much time do you have left? NOT MUCH, IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT WITH YOUR SHIRT STILL ON."

Twitter is the most damaging and dangerous company to America and Americans.
Lard boy in mar a loco is thriving on his newfound party of Jewish laser beams and baby eaters.
Goldman Sach upgraded the target price of Snap Chat at the price of $70 today. We must write to the Twitter board and demand a resignation of Jack Dorsey. Snap Chat doesn't have to spend a billion dollars to do stock buyback and the price has already gone over $51 with the higher target price of $70. Twitter has not even re test the 2014 high of $57 dollars while Snap Chat keeps making new high. What does this tell you!! Twitter stock price will not improve as long as we keep Jack Dorsey on board as a part time CEO.
As Nasdaq rallies Twtr sells off. Strong sell

Too much up. Sell the news.
let me get this straight..Twitter loses half ot users and beat earnings LMAOOOOO
"Twitter way undervalued and still not fully understood by the masses, but that is changing , the value isnt in the useless status updates or even what celebrities have to say, its an agregator of human analyzed, curated, and created data, news, and more. Those subscription features are going to make sense. You may think im crazy but im pretty sure, it will be $150 within 6 months."
Does anyone have a good securities lawyer? I want to sue twitter for beach of fiduciary duty to shareholders.
Looking forward to to watching this drop on Monday
I deactivated my account
I am out folks. Liquidated my Twitter long position. Any tine a company begins to Qualify their customer base it is never optimal for the bottom line. As a wise man once said to me: If you are all in agreement with me I do not need all of you! Long live Freedom of Speech!
Sell this #$%$ company!
Lets get this down past $40 by close. 20$ by the end of the week. Twitter cant sustain itself on just koolaid hair socialists.
Chart Update: Of Course TWTR Is Very Overbought! Plus Market Is Headed Down!
$TWTR closed down over 5%. Only news was an outright lie from Dow Jones that $TWTR fell 2.8% (news at 4:02 ET). Deep State in Finance. This will could get interesting.

Dropping Twitter was the best thing of all. It seems Twitter is a hub or racist activities. Look at how much Twitter triggers violence across the globe. How many times do we need to see law enforcement post things liek we seen in Kentucky where they are the ones triggering racist activities? it is shameful for anyone who works at Twitter and contribute to global anarchy and unrest

Bidens Education token huspanic said yesterday in some comvoluted way that it's fine for men to compete against women. This administration is a disaster.
"I'm calling hogwash on Jack Dorsey's statements this morning. He is pulling the wool over the eyes of his willing accomplices in the media, investment houses and political realm, but not on those of us that have seen the light! Okay, here's the problem. He's making a killing over at Square, because he had the foresight to get invested bigly in Bitcoin! That's keeping him afloat for now. And making me second guess my short position, for now! I may just hold it and add to it if the price rises 10-20% on the claims that censoring free speech and millions of conservatives leaving his platform don't matter to the bottom line. If you believe that, I have 20,000 bitcoin to sell you at 40k!"

Twitter Encourages Users to Snitch on Each Other with ‘Birdwatch’ Feature
"Hey Demo-communists. I know it's hard for you to follow the bouncing ball. But let's try to keep it real simple for you. YOU are the one cheering the banning of people on social media. YOU are the one cheering for separation of races. YOU are the one that supports the brown shirt riots in our streets. YOU are the one that repeats the propaganda lies from the fake media, with provable lies. YOU are the one calling for people you don't agree with to be put in re-education camps. YOU are the one who cheers when peoples books are not allowed, therefore book burning them. YOU are the one who wants to shut down businesses if they don't want to make a certain cake, or agree with your ideology. YOU want full control of the government, with no checks on the things you want to control. YOU want people to have dependency on he government from cradle to grave. YOU are the FASCIST. And you don't even realize it, lol. Oh, your handlers must be laughing at useful idiots like you. Telling themselves what a good re-education job they did on you.Does this sound like YOU Democrats? Answer: YES!!!""The Nassies, like Mussolini, were fascists in their aim of centralized government control under a one-party system with the curtailment of regional and personal independence. Hittler sought to separate the youth of Germany from the old ideals through ""education"" into nassie ideology.Conservatives are the antithesis of the original fascists and fascist ideology. Conservatives believe in checks on government power, whether in terms of checks among branches and state vs. federal, or checks between competing parties. Conservatives want to maintain and support non-government institutions like the church and family and social organizations and prevent overweening government in local affairs.Conservatives inherently distrust power in the hands of any individual, group of individuals, or party, whether nassie or socialist. They seek to further individual freedoms the fascists hated and sought to end, like free speech, the individual right to bear arms and the individual rights of families in education""."
It might be the beginning of the end for Twitter!

TWTR CEO reminds me oh how #$%$ Germany was started. I laugh everyday how their CEO takes action to censor people and fails to see how he is following the same path as so many evil dictators did before him only with out the same technology. Anyone who works there seems to be ok with this so what does that tell you about their company. Amazing.
I sold all my TWTR shares.

"What a great analyst? Wow, if life could be that simple.https://www.barrons.com/articles/twitter-stock-upgrade-sales-51613072327?siteid=yhoof2"
Who would be buying this stock? It going nowhere. You will see a bump from those holding out for miracle. It's dead. Jack Dorsey just tossed it away.
The smart ones have sold already. The real decline will occur once TWTR is forced to publish the reduced subscribership statistics. That will be a beautiful event.
"I’m short too. DASH, POSH. ABNB....short term. Covered calls..."
"Good morning, Friends. It's Friday, January 29, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"

"Anyone else feel like the recent upgrades are a desperate ploy to dump stock? I can understand maintaining a price target at this point, and take a wait-and-see approach. But to upgrade now, without knowing the full effects on twitter's base, seems foolish and dangerous. At best a technical bounce is in order, at worse another 20% (or more) decline."
"looks like twitter is going to be broken up, so sad, hope you got out lol"
Half the users have walked away since the weekend. Twitter is not a happening place.
This will be just like yesterday.....open slightly up and then fall all the rest of the day.

If your personal information is hacked through Twitter their is evidence that Twitter will not tell you and your bank accounts and assets are at EXTREME RISK! Do not follow Jack Dorsey into his dark place!
Definately strong sell
All those people who left. They're not coming back.
so this chat is censored as well. my post was deleted. How sad. I did not post any lies or hate. just the reason why I deleted my Twitter account.
This stock has zero retail support and is being held up completely by hedge funds using their wealthy clients money.
Let me get this right. Twitter just got rid of the biggest draw on it's platform and just told all his followers to go F'm selves? Puts are going to be very expensive for this stock on Monday.
i love freedom

Good to see this is still tanking.
You so-called patriots who keep trying to destroy this pps actually gave me a great entry price of $44.05. Won't get out till $60.
Do you realize that Dorsey committed fraud in lying to Congress. As info from O'Keefe goes against what he said under sworn testimony. Can't wait for O'Keefe's next drop.

More pain today for the cult.
"Big legal trouble for TWTR. On their last 10Q under Risk factors the closest they come to censorship is what others do to them and not the other way around.....This is what I found....actions by governments or others to restrict access to Twitter or censor content on Twitter, such as how domestic Internet service providers in China have blocked access to Twitter and other countries, including Iran, Libya, Pakistan, Turkey and Syria, have intermittently restricted access to Twitter, whether these actions are taken for political reasons, in response to decisions we make regarding governmental requests or content generated by people on Twitter, or otherwise;"
"Let me be very clear here $TWTR didn’t make money before 80M users left the platform, because of censorship run wild. Upgrading the stock is radically irresponsible and should be investigated by the SEC immediately!"
"Today’s sad fact: The number of unarmed African-Americans killed by police in 2019 was - More than 1,000? 500-999? 200-499? 50-199? Other?FBI statistics show the actual number was 27. Out of a population of 330,000,000+.The MSM is LYING to you via the CIA. Don’t fall for racial division, it is an attempt to destroy the middle class and. America itself."

I have been on Twitter ( not any more ) and parler and there is far more hate on twitter then I ever saw on parler..Those who believe Parler was a hate site have never used it and only believe what the media tells them which is sad and scary..Sad they believe the media and scary if the media says jump off the building they will
"Amazing! Simply amazing! I have learned that the many conservatives that refuse to leave Twitter are still there for one main purpose. Evangelism. That's it, that's the only reason. It's enemy territory being infiltrated for the cause of Christ. That's the only reason I kept my Facebook account, but I cancelled Twitter (even though it used to be my favorite form of SM). Let's see how long this post lasts?"
This stock is 'dead money'. How is dropping half your subs good for business? Iran still on TWTR with their 'death to America'.

I think this is going Down next week
The longs on TWTR are pretty hostile now as their leader decided to abandon capitalism in favor of servitude to the Technocrats who know what is best for them.

"Institunional investors will soon start runing away. How can any respectable firm put it's money into a company, that is so unpredictable. What if one day, after a long crack smoking session, Jack Dorsey will deside that Twitter will fund North Korea's nuclear program? How reliable is that?"

If we show one tech company at a time - this time, Twitter - and create our own platforms, counterparts to the other mainstream platforms will come about.

The tech giants would rather see tens of thousands of innocent people die than allow this information out to the public.

This story just gets better and better. I am sure Faux Business News is reporting that Twitter's stock is way down for the year.
Twitter and Facebook company meeting
sell Amazon $AMZN Sell Facebook $FB SELL Twitter $TWTR ....GET OUT!!!!!!
Up 120% since last August. Stock price 16x sales/share. Negative EPS. Profit margin -31%. ROE - 14%. Revenue $3.7 Bil . Book Value $10/share. Market Cap $68 Bil ? This stock is pumped up to moon?
Twitter is the new talaban of America
Where are all the Obama green jobs?
"SO, about half the country will deactivate their accounts. Ha!"
I’m proud to say I sent 22 eviction notices last week. Only to my liberal tenants. Cancel culture can be fun for conservatives too!
On Oct 29 2020 TWTR stock lost 25% on a bad news. W/O any big change or improvements they inched there way back up with a 2G stock buyback. Now don't expect them to get out of this one. The TWTR platform was a big part of that on going disastrous vicious political game. You can't eat your cake and have it. It's time for them to pay for their greedy irresponsible behavior. Early this week many will start to keep their distance from TWTR and the stock price will fall hard and fast
Communist tactic is censorship this will post 90% will be censored
The best part of shorting this is I am taking some liberal putz”s money
Does anyone want to pay a transaction tax? Might be coming.
When thousands of people stormed the Capitol in Madison 10 years ago to stop the vote on collective bargaining Nancy praised them. Miss two face..
"haven't used Twitter or facebook for a about a year now and I don't miss one bit. I never had an issue with any of the platforms, I just found myself living through them more and more and had to make a change. One of the best decisions i could've ever made. My life and overall mindset has improved greatly over the last year. I still have many open accounts that I am deleting today. I hope this catches on and sticks because I really do feel that it is for the better of every single individual person. Go out and talk face to face with people, so that you can develope real relationships with real emotions. It is natural and healthy."
They opened the day with some pump from the Press and started selling Calls here comes the dump. Can't tell you how many times I've been on the wrong side of a trade because the same brutal tactics. Stay Short my friends
More troops in Capitol now than in Iraq & Afghanistan?
"And it’s green, heard someone was saying bye bye Twitter few minutes ago. Wya ?!"
heading to 60s next week 100%
"Beats by 7 cents, beats revs. The train is leaving."
What is the past tense of Twitter? Asking for myself.
Buyout in the coming future .Price should be $100.00 a share.
"One thing the board is forgetting and this may get deleted again! Once Trump takes out Biden in the final round (next week), you can be sure section 230 will be destroyed and his executive order from 2018 will delist this #$%$ from the Nasdaq. Outside of everything else, this will be worth $0."
wheres the big drop? 3 bucks lol
Next week will be interesting. The gap between Wall Street and Main Street is now so wide something is bound to happen. Very poor job figures are coming in yet major indexes at all-time highs. Tech ads are going to see to people without a job and money? Will be interesting!

"Hooray..after the steep decline in twtr stock price on monday,there will be a ton of lawsuits based on management malfeasance.The trial lawyers will be earing one of their own..LET the lawsuits begin hooray"
This is gonna fall so hard ( morning ) my advice Sell quickly
Take your money and run. Sell.
Looks like Gab and Parler (post AWS ban recovery) will soon eat TWTR’s lunch!
People in Minneapolis are complaining about high crime and slow response by the Police. How is that defunding working for you?
Easiest short I’ve ever seen
LOL I guess it’s poor business to alienate half of a country/client base eh?This action is going to be in business case studies for years!
"I got an idea what these little spikes are throughout the day. Reminds me of the Dominion-voting on election night and then when the Georgia Senate races were being reported. Big difference here! The clock doesn't run out, so every buying binge gets followed by reality setting in. Can't fake buying pressure but so long..."
Would love to see this thing gap down into the 44s next week just enough to trigger a bunch of stop losses. Anyone who bought this commie propaganda tool on the dip deserves to lose their money.
 flying again
Orwell almost got it right BIG TECH IS WATCHING...
IMPEACH
I heard Jack is cashing his stock in before it tanks?
Went 50% into cash. This isn't going to be pretty. Too much out there that even those who seek to control are unable to stop those who seek the truth.
I swear I am not making this up - Twitter Says Internet Shutdowns ‘Violate Basic Human Rights’ — in Uganda
Feeble attempt to rally falls flat
OMG ... 'TrumpTV' will be Armageddon for Jackoff's little Twitter.
THUD>>>>>>>> MAGA FOREVER
"Wow, yahoo has a liberal on this board actively suppressing free speech. Now that's dedication."
"Those interesting in trading, not necessarily $TWTR as a company to buy and invest in:- If the closing price is @ the low for the day (or a headfake next to it), look for a string of down days- Make money up or down, it's your money, it is not a religion- Aside: The Golden Globes was not good for $TWTR, unfortunate for the brand"
"More room to fly.....flying higher to $100 plus level,,, no stopping"
"Sponsored post:Twitter's growth over the long term is said to be its ability to connect advertisers with users. Check disclaimer in the landing page.

I deleted my Twitter account - so should everyone else. Who actually uses twitter???? Who - except unemployed liberals - have time to read all those feeds. Twitter is proven now nothing more than an arm of the Democratic/liberal party.
Selling mine today. Too much distraction from business
I can't own shares in a company that doesn't have the best interest of all of it's share holders. What Twitter did we pure left wing political nonsense.
$35 on the way.
Msm and Big Tech are the real pandemic
"I just printed and mailedmy vision for America , ‘Letter to Americans!’ to every household ! 128 million households.. Cost me 90 Million ,it’s worth it! ,nobody blocked it or took it down! It’s in the mail."
I guess we’re supposed to be taking suggestions from Dorsey now with Bitcoin. Lol
DownDownDownDownDown it goes Where it stopsNobody knows
this stock will lose 15% every week for the the whole year.
"I dumped twitter, cancelled my Amazon Prime account, will never buy another Iphone. STICK IT big tech... totalitarians."
How do I sell in the pre market. I want to get out ASAP. Why would they block their best customer.
Timber !!!!! look out below
killing free speech should have massive consequences.
"The current Bull Market began in March of 2009. It is nearly 12 years old, the longest in history.History tells us that stock valuations do not go up indefinitely. I believe Biden's economic policies will usher in a new Bear Market- just look at what he has already done to the energy sector."

"The smart money will be shorting this stock, they know citizens worldwide cherish free speech! Twitter is going down!"
Done with Twitter. These social media companies just went down a rabbit hole from which there is no escape.
Big sell-off tommorow coming. Nobody is going to want to hold this over a 3 day weekend
Any other stock with news of this magnitude would be all over the news. You try to find an article or discussion on any of these platforms about what’s going to happen to this stock tomorrow......it’s crickets.
Anybody hear Mike Lindell rip Jack Dorsey a new one today?
"If you think those are mom and pop retail investors, leaving on higher than usual volume , you're wrong."

A bunch of buthurt shorts bashing Twitter when in reality it’s one of the most undervalued social media stock out there & with absolutely solid upside ahead.... a bunch emotional unworthy pessimistic apes  get off this message board if you’re negative bums
@.0000001 I will wait for that price...
happily not have social media if it means the left dont get total control
I’ll put from here till Friday is guaranteed money
"This stock was trading for $20 in March 2020, when it had twice as many users than it has now. Think about that..."
45.52-1.70 (-3.60%)As of 3:20PM EST. Market open.
Interesting business strategy to tell half your user base they’re not allowed to say what they think on your “free speech” platform.Let’s see how this pays off for investors.
"The stock opened at 52.31 last Friday. When it opens tomorrow it will be somewhere around 45. That's a loss of around 15% in one week. When will shareholders demand Jack's removal as CEO? Which activist investor wants to buy these shares and a massive discount, oust Jack, and see the shares go to 80?"
Make your next cell phone purchase a Samsung. Ditch the Apple iphone and the one made by Google.
How much has Twitter lost the last 7 trading days ?
picking up a short position at 48... thanks twitter!
nice Bear Candle on the 30 here comes the Pain
"Twitter will be line a floppy disk.., never to be used again."
did jack really think Trumps 80 millions followers would be okay with this ?most of those 80 millions have left twitter for good.this stock is heading to 10 a sharehello communist chuck.
"Seriously,,who is buying this twitter stock now?"
You can be a communist in a free country but you cant be free in a communist country.
Hoping to get some short action tomorrow on Twitter. But I can’t trade pre mkt have to wait til 9:30. Futures already down bigly this could be the thing that brings stock market bull run to its knees
"I see the stock is going up in the pre market, guess people don;t care about free speech, so sad"
"No amount of Yahoo! censoring on this message board can prop up TWTR but for so long. I'm excited about this trade! So much so, I doubled down early this morning. And TWTR is the queen of censorship, with rich uncles Jeff Z and Jeff B on the right and left. It may work for the Washington Post and Facebook, but Twitter needs open and honest tweeting to succeed. There's no emotional attachment to the platform. I, along with millions of others, simply and summarily deactivated my account. Others were de-platformed or censored or put on some kind of Dorsey-invented probation. The whole thing is a joke and will be a laughingstock at some point down the line in history!"
Announcement this AM. CPAC 2021 tomorrow. There are no coincidences.
"Since Yahoo keeps deleting my posts: Sell this stock, protect Freedom!!!!"
The chart looks horrible. Looks like the next level is 40 after the 46.54 did not hold. I would hate to be holding shares of Twitter right now. No worries I might buy your shares to cover my short interest at 35
I bought and used all my savings on puts to reward myself. I believe in liberties. say no communism
In short as of right now
BOYCOTT SQUARE AND TWITTER—Pay cash at restaurants (the owners will love you) and Delete your Twitter account!
TWTR losing millions costumer daily .The business is like sinking ship.
Trying to invoke the 25th amendment will only inspire those who love this country to take to the streets (peacefully).

I listened to the speech and didn’t hear anything that would incite trump supporters though I do think his speech would incite antifa...

I am selling my 10000 shares of twtr on Monday I am not happy
It's time to sell. Going down with Twitter will be the same as going down with titanic.
Make your bets....Red or Green at close?
Join Paler...abandon Twitter AKA Pravda
"Even after Dorsey's attempt to calm, if TWTR closes below 46.50, the next support is around 42.50 then down to 39.50. This is looking Bearish at the moment and breaking through some technicals."
"If you are asked to pay for something via square, just decline and pay cash."
No idea who in their right mind would hold this plutonium over the weekend.
I cant wait to see how much this is down in pre-market!!!
"It is strange, the folk who seem to despise a former president (who really isn’t in the news much any more) are still head over heals infatuated with him.Do you think they have posters in their bedrooms on the ceiling? One does wonder."

"Oh and lets impeach a president without any hearing or evidence... just based on hearsay, media reports and doctored video. Thank GOD it’s only a political stunt and means absolutely zero."
My prediction. 6-months and this will be on the Pink Sheets trading for 30c.
"I read that Dorsey is selling off, he knows the end is near."
short it short it all day
Might find support at $30. Until then. Better money to be made buying value stocks that don’t pick political correctness over neutrality.

"Yahoo, are you censoring and violating our freedom of speech as well?"
Not only should ALL social media be shut down but all MSM that cannot be unbiased needs to be closed! Journalism is about unbiased investigating for the truth and not some personal agenda!!!
I have to wonder if Jack Dorsey may have been paid off by the Chinese Communist Party or some other leftist operative like George Soros. He seems to be hurting his own stockholders with his censorship activity.The stock is taking a beating losing customers and alienating half of the country. This is bad business.Profits which were never really good are going to be down even greater along with stock value.
Looking to get back in at $43 or the 200 day. Thoughts?
"There is a rumour that anyone that uses social media to communicate , “ with other humans” .. Aliens and others excluded., will be required to pass a test.

Twitter to start charging people to use their services? Run for the hills!
"If it drops to $10/share, I might buy some."
When do people think this will fall. Is this going to be a Tilray type of drop?
short broken companies. Twitter has bad financials and I would deem them as broken for suspending the acting president of the USA.
"It's making lower highs and lower lows. Longs, Start averaging down until you get to $0"
"I don't really support shorting stocks in general. However, shorting Twitter is a win for democracy!"
Lol! Twitter suspends another person for not being a limp wrist wimp? I hope this stock hits single digits by March. Twitter is the red knight in this amazing video clip.
I am hoping this company goes out of business....

An educated person that makes strait 100s. They have to believe everything they are taught. This means that they are slaves. Is that smart. You have realize that 50% that is taught in school is propaganda. So if you think you are smart maybe you better think again.
Well congratulations to Cuckoo Dorsey and Crazy Joe they successfully wrecked the market in 8 days of teamwork.
ceo doing the pump and dump game. very shady!
Twitter is for bag holders.. This will not be going up anytime soon..
How can I recover Monday morning. I don’t think my asking price will hold as this drops. Any helpful suggestions are appreciated.
"Everything liberals touch turns to Dog #$%$ just like San Francisco, New York and Twatter"

"Welcome to Twitter! Uh... Yahoo! Finance Twitter public stock forum... where you can still share you opinions freely, and @Jack cannot do a dang thing about it. In fact, all those people he kicked off of Twitter platform are now coming here to air out their grievances. Personally speaking, I quit posting on Nov 3 and then deactivated a few days ago. Reason being... I don't participate on platforms that are corrupt and try to brazenly manipulate and subvert the minds of the masses. @Jack did it, and now he is paying the price. And I've heard the one thing they hate is to have someone like me or you share our opinion publicly when it makes them look bad. Oh, the irony!!!"
"So you Twitter investors, explain to the rest of us how Twitter could declare a loss of $7.44 MILLION, and still managed to hand BLM $10 Million. Twitter has to go down."
As it now appears the titans of MSM/SocialMedia together with the DeepState/Socialist/Marxist/Globalist cabal have won. No other reason to explain the Orwellian stock of Twtr to rise other than that. But 1st impressions can be misleading. It's either a Republic or an arm of the CCP.

There behavior will be there downfall. This is not just attack against the President but an attack on free speach for all peoples. We are going to see them collapse into the history books and be remembered for sedition and corruption. How the mighty will fall.

So if all government supporters do the same it will be a huge kick in the teeth for them.GOD Bless all Patriots around the world the universe and beyond.

Hope Twitter and Facebook go out of business. I have use Twitter in 5 years and I have cancelled my Facebook account. They will never influence me again
How’s Uganda’s doing ?

"Either someone sends Jack Dorsey to H-e-l—l, or Jack Dorsey cut himself to go to H-e-l—l. I will award 1 cent for it."
Twitter started the run too late and chose the wrong time. Hence the shareholder lawsuit to silence him. The purchase of the recent company was a reach to a peg of a drowning company and they overpaid extremely because it was from desperation.
Yes! Ark Is Buying Twitter! Our Beautiful Bird Just Got a Gold Star! $60's Incoming! Tweet It Baby Tweet It!

"Twitter compare to FB is one trick pony, their business will be hurt much more. Users of Twitter are more politically active. Conservative part will be heard, maybe not by voices, but by loosing revenue."
"Maybe limiting free speech to only the left might have been a bad idea, lol."
"It’s really sad to see people have no principles and buying this. For those buying, do you think conservative leaning people will return to the platform? And for those who are elated by the censorship, please go watch the hundreds of Holocaust survivor videos. Listen to the stories of the men who perished while storming the beaches of Normandy. So many people gave their lives so that you can say you don’t want these rights. Learn how countries become communist and socialist. Please go elsewhere and leave this country to those that appreciate its rights."

Most hated company in tge world 
"Americans and their rights are being abolished one by one. TWTR is just a cog in the wheel of elimination of your 1st Amendment right. Next comes AOC’s taking down of “opposition speech”. First, they came after the Jew, but I wasn’t a Jew. Then they came after the Gypsies but I wasn’t a Gypsy. Then they..... etc.etc.By the time they came after me there was no one left to stand up and fight. So true these days!"
Jack is buying in AH to make it appear to be green. Wasting his time. Dropping again tomorrow. No support below.
"80 million Trumpster gone to other platforms. Trumpsters' liberal opposition follow them to the other platforms to harass. So, 75% of TWTR activity gone. The best part is that 4,900 TWTR employees join the homeless on the streets of San Francisco. Trumpsters win in the long run."

"This is why TWIT suspended president account. They are afraid of new admin. Its so obvious: A former economic adviser under President Barack Obama and the former Facebook privacy and public policy adviser, Ghosh, as well as a growing number of scholars, is calling for social networks to face consequences for enabling the spread of the lies, hate speech, and conspiracy theories that led to the Capitol attack."
Going down faster than Monica on Bubba Clinton.
"3,350,000 shares in the first minute at about $77.85 average ($quarter billion). Either the sellers are really smart or the buyers are really dumb. Time will tell."

"Guys what's your parler accounts, post them in a reply so we can follow each other. My parler is @DropShock. Deactivated twitter after years of use, it's not enough we delete twitter but we also deactivate our accounts so that during the earnings report they can see a huge drop in accounts"

Twitter has lied to American people as they stated day one they were an open and fair platform. Twitter has lied to us and in now censoring free speech. If we allow tech companies to commit this crime whats next.Everyone needs to quit Twitter now or big tech will learn they CAN control us.It is crucial the people ACT !!Quit Twitter immediately and sell all their stock.
sell it all !!!!!!!!
Good news now is that you don't need to repeal Section 230 as Twtr just imploded.

Unequivocally unamerican to own this stock.
There is now evidence that disgruntled Twitter employees have leaked information out to cyber criminal organizations to help them get rid of Jack Dorsey. Your personal information and Bank Accounts are at EXTREME RISK if you are using Twitter!
so much for freedom of speech...

This is what happens when you condone this censorship based solely on your own beliefs. You can’t silence everyone you don’t agree with and think you won’t get backlash. R.I.P. Twitter. Dorsey already looks like a homeless person. I can’t imagine what this will do to him.

"To see the bright side of things, at least people are slowly waking up to how bad these social media platforms are for society. They are a plague that is destroying the fabric of society and how we interact with each other."
The paradox for TWTR may be that there is a lack of short interest in the stock. Nobody wants to be caught in another GME debacle. The stock rises because it is mainly day traders. Pump and dump. The stock will drop dramatically when the equilibrium fails.
Shorting Twitter is the new Stimulus Plan!

"I shorted again this morning. Gotta remember, a 10% move in one day is generally a good time to take profits. However, there are exception. The air is coming out of Dorsey's balloon with predictable certainty! Also, I am a long in SRNE and INSM. Biotech is risky, but has tremendous upside! The institutions buy up biotech low, and then the standoff is for how many retail will sell their shares before the price explodes higher. In Twitter's case, the institutions were loaded up, and they're in a standoff for who blinks first. Meanwhile, retail has been exited on their intuition that this will not end well!"
Hope this goes to 40 next week.
"There will be a massive offloading of Twitter shares today. The fall in share price will be faster than we've seen all week. Project Veritas has spilled the beans on Dorsey, and you can bet the institutions want out asap, while they can still save some of their investment. Get out people. It's going to hurt anyone caught up in this. If they won't buy your limit, make it a market sell, because that's probably how fast this is going to drop. When that happens the little man has no chance unless he gets out at market price."
will keep shorting

look like 20% higher down for today...sell your share before i short all the way to $10

TWTR's earnings report will be very misleading. The disaster that#$%$ this company did not start til after the end of the quarter - so the quarter that's about to be announced will not show the disaster ahead. Hopefully some longs and TWTR supporters will double up once earnings are announced and then get smoked when the next quarter's earnings are announced. Single digits are inevitable. You were warned - again.

Twitter has transformed social media to social nightmare under the disguise of free speech and ended with censorship of people and political views that lead to loss of trust to company and its leaders. It also damage its business and investors have lost their trust as well. Only institutions still holding Twitter shares right now will soon face the pressure from their clients and exit their positions in kitchen sink next few days or weeks.
Twitter offers nothing of value. Much like Facebook.
"Let’s all just sat that Twitter was a good idea, but it has issues. So lets agree to ditch Twitter and make a new website called Chirper ... because all twitter is .., is a website nothing more!"

"Last chance to sell before the ""Plunge"""
"Great job twitter Revenue rose 28% to $1.29 billion, compared with the $1.19 billion average analyst prediction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twitter on Tuesday cited “strong brand advertiser demand in the U.S.” as a driver of ad sales in the fourth quarter, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Net income rose to $222 million, or 27 cents a share. Twitter reported 192 million daily active users, 26% growth from a year earlier but shy of estimates for 193.4 million. Overall for 2020 the company added 40 million new daily users, crediting the gains to both “product improvements” and a series of major events that drew in audiences, including the U.S. presidential election and discussion around the global Covid-19 pandemic.

"My today’s Twitter prediction..It will open down 4 bucks, and by afternoon the sellers will bring it down hard closing around 40."
Twitter and FB will soon be banned in Australia and UK
#twtr Twitter is a perfect stock to short right now.
TWTR will be charged with Treason against the United States of America and shutdown permanently!
Congrats shorts
Cannot wait to short this bag full of lies limiting free speech and such.
"As soon as Parler and Gab get sorted, this dumpster fire becomes and inferno."
"More resources expended to protect state capitols equates less resources to respond to the offices of TWTR, FB, GOOG, AMZN, et.al. should something go awry"
TWTR will trend down for days and days as more bad news sinks in
Not expecting any game changing numbers here that leaves it up to the guidance.
"Maybe Twitter does not care about profit or customers, maybe it was threatened for doing so, maybe someone provides more funds. Anyway, Twitter is no longer a social media as we thought."
if Parler goes public the stock would soar.
Looks like a nice AH bull trap to me
Gas prices up 20% in two weeks under the Emperor. boo yah skee daddy

Giving Twitter an upgrade and a buy signal is like giving the Roseanne cast an Emmy after they removed the star...

"Go to YouTube account ""The White House"" and look at the like and dislikes for the first videos of the most popular administration in American history"" LMAO"
"TWTR has become an evil internet bully and propaganda machine that can decide what voice can be heard or surpressed just like the Chinese Communist Party-controlled state media. It has become the media tyranny and a great threat to freedom of speech in a democratic society. It's up to the people to decide what information is true or false but not the media platform. Chinese Great Firewall also claim it will weed out all foreign news it deemed ""harmful"", and Twitter is no different from the CCP party mouthpiece."
"Mussolini, WWII Germans all censored truth. Why is TWTR going down that path today?"
"CNBC...2 analysts... one technical, one fundamentalBoth SELL"
BYE BYE TWITTER. Kicking the main source of traffic from your money losing platform was not smart... that's what happens when you have a leftist ideologue as CEO
Sell sell sell
Is this the Twitter board?
when the media said the hospitals were full in the key hotspots during the peaks they were basically EMPTY as conformed by citizens. Greatest FRAUD in history
All you can do with a company this badly run is SHORT IT. I'm shorting it. I expect it to be trading on the otc market in 6 months for 30c or less.
"Twitter doesn't serve any purpose, other than to allow Free Speech. Without that, they are useless, and will evaporate like Rubber Cement Thinner."
SNAP is trading at 30x sales. Pins about 25. TWTR about 13. Still trading at a significant discount to its peers. Going HIGHER!
Expenses growing more than user base 25%+ expense increase this year get the hell out while you can
All this talk about boycotting Twitter. The worst offender of free speech may actually be YAHOO. Notice how the comment section was completely eliminated months before the election?
Twitter wanted Parler shut down because people were leaving witter by the millions. Not a sustainable model. Now they have angered half of America. Their business model is too easy to copy. They will be gone. Facebook will find that they have a flimsy model too. My company pulled all their advertising out of social media. Toxic environment.
Twatter is going to lose 45% of it's value.
I wonder how many posting here were part of the mob insurrection ? Hmmmm.... sad many posting here support their cause

"Telling TWTR has 330 million users, while Telegram is up to over 500 million. Wonder why the rapid growth???"
Lawsuits are coming because jack intentionally ranked his company and stock price.
"Apple, Amazon and Twitter are acting like the 5 families of the tech world. They should be charged with the Rico Act, its' a coordinated hit."
"If and when the market reverses course, Twitter will lead the pack of bears to winter hibernation. Right now, it seems that FB and AMZN are propping up TWTR. But it's turning into a lonely outpost over there. From a vibrant gold-rush bastion to an abandoned old ghost town..."
Twitter finally free!!!!
This announcement was negative today. 20% growth does not justify this valuation... not even close.
All social media propaganda needs to go.
"For what it's worth - this is the only stock I presently hold, that I have any confidence in. I may eat those words, but I doubt it."
It is so funny reading comments about people justifying buying this stock

"Once Parler is back up and with the GabExdous in full swing this think will be toast. Dorsey knows this, which is why he is bleating on about creating something decentralised, he doesn't care about shareholders, just how to make money from the next technological pivot."
10% or 15% down in the AM ? Or 20% plus
Can't believe anybody would buy This stock what a piece of Krapp
only down 8% what a gift .Sell anytime a stock drops below 7% in a day. Anytime a stock goes up 7% in a day buy. Old school trading works 100% of the time.

"The Coup Crew is still at it but slowly making themselves obsolete.

"Barney Rubble from the Flintstones with his Water Buffalo' Hat on with his American Flag and Spear, some call him King Neptune. That representation is not about what occurred on January 6th, that was just part of the piled on Circus side show's. The reasons why TWTR stock will plunge is also really separate from the events of January 6th. The reason why TWTR stock will fall, is about Social Media's actions relating to Freedom of Speech. You'd have to go back to Paul Revere and the Lanterns to understand that! TWTR has Violated the first Amendment and for that the Free World their is a price to pay. The U.S.A Citizens saw this type of control in China and Russia the suppression of free speech for years,. Our Free Capital Markets will surly send a message to not only TWTR, but to Facebbook, Google and others. In that group for many months to come will be product boycotts of advertisers as Products on those sights. There are 65 to 80 million Americans and maybe more who understand the Freedom of Speech and no change in administration is going to allow that to occur."

Qanon Shaman is running the country now since Donnie went in hiding.
"Twitter is simply destined to fail. There is no other way to see it. Whether it be by Dorsey’s own doing, the public protests that are inevitable worldwide, or the simple lack of public support through the course of the next four years. Any way I look at it, it is destined for failure. The most provocative instance is that there are 20-30 hungry better apps ready to take its place."
broke down hard today. Any news?
SELL before it’s too late. User lost and law suits will definitely drag Twitter down. JD is not protecting the investors. Too bad for us.
When does the free market realize the vulnerability of social media to their bottom line?

I think Twitter has made a big mistake. My opinion!
"Alec Baldwin is temporarily suspending his acct because of issues when is wife made statements on her acct ,that raised questions about whether they were truthful or not. He's been getting hassled ever since then. Love it when the liberals feast on themselves"
"I did sell short heavily yesterday and made 10% , I will do it again when the time is right . I want to see TWTR disappear"

Twitter should go back to what it does best - telling the world about the cute thing your cat just did.
Call your brokers today! Demand them to rid your 401K of these toxic companies!
USA! USA! USA!
At what point does the BOD have the fiduciary responsibility to toss out Dorsey and others for breach of their fiduciary duties to shareholders. If this stock falters now there will be a no brainer CA.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Wells Fargo scam in the making...Twitter employees are probably creating fake Twitter profiles to bump up the numbers...there’s no way after the massive exodus last quarter they are beating numbers...
Hope TWTR and other platforms that decided to become arms of the woke left mob will find their way to irrelevance.
"Time to dump Twitter stock. Half the nation is no longer allowed to post there. They just purged 4,000 of my conservative followers, with more to come. James Woods lost 173,000. Twitter is just a refrigerator magnet for the Democrat Party."

So when do all the TWTR lawsuits begin?
Who’s ready for another fabulous day of shorting this turd? Option market shows more bleeding. Puts outweigh the calls 3-1...
"“Anyone else feeling beyond let down?” one top post on a popular QAnon forum read. ""It's like being a kid and seeing the big gift under the tree thinking it is exactly what you want only to open it and realize it was a lump of coal.""Not a lump of coal. Underwear and t-shirts. Because santy clause is your mom and dad, and a lump of coal implies he's real and thought you were bad that year. But the TRUTH is underwear and t-shirts, and a prickly wool sweater for school. Now grow up, start thinking about a job, shave, smell nice. Try."
The bird is leaving it’s nest Down Down Down
"How could a company which was declaring a loss of over $7 Billion back in March, just hand $10 Billion of shareholders money to BLM? Hello SEC? Can you look into this..."
Glad I dumped my Twitter shares a few weeks ago. will be selling Apple shares next week.
"Think about this. The one year low for TWTR in March was $20. And that was because of Covid. Which made people stay inside and tweet all day. Now, it's $47 and they are losing millions of accounts, world leaders are condemning, and there is serious competition coming soon. do you still think it should be higher than the March low???"
However bought at 46.56 -59 is a genius this Twitter won’t go away people will miss it whoever leave their loss. Bye bye Felicia I wanted price down so can get Twitter stock haha 
Democrats will turn and start eating their own before too long!
"How come the BLM ACTIVIST who was arrested for his part in the Capitol Invasion. The same guy who egged on others to burn the place down. The same guy who egged on Ashley Babbitt and then filmed her being shot and dying. IS WALKING THE STREETS FREE AS A BIRD. He's CIA. Look at the pictures of him in paramilitary uniform with a semi-automatic rifle on his shoulder, and a holstered sidearm. It was a total set-up. The Boogaloos were caught on camera before the event saying they were there to cause to trouble and that they supported BLM. Work it out."
Trump today will go after Twitter. Watch the stock collapse.
Half will leave twitter. The other half will follow.
Down a whopping 2 cents after hours! What a fantastic short play!! Your protests are immensely effective!!!
"twitter loses 20%, bounces less than 2% and longs celebrate...how sad."
Millions of shares about to be dumped
The alleged MOLESTER of young staffer Tara Reade is now calling himself President.
"This weekend showed that Big Tech has way too much power and are overstepping their authority. If you want a free country and not operate like Communist China, we have to leverage the only power we have which is to complete stop utilizing the following company's service. 1) FaceBook 2) Twitter 3) Google 4) Amazon and 5) Apple"
TWTR= SOLD. (Thanks for the +40% gains. See ya!)
"Wife ""Why did they repo the car? Husband our fund manager went long on Twitter"

If you get off social media -- your life improves.
Censorship - especially of government officials - will not fly here in the U.S.
Bankruptcy soon!
"I cancelled my account on Twit, Facebook, and Amazon. Now it's time to short Twit and Facebook out of existence. They serve no useful purpose and fuel hate. Time to dump the swamp."
twtr has made me so much money. mainly shorting it!!!
Millions of users are cancelling their accounts. We are also see competition in this space. If it keeps dropping will they be forced to reduce headcount?
Any minute now the stock should pull back...lol
Karen Finerman shorted TWTR today.
Buy more Twitter shares? Yes ! Only to SHORT!! The greatest Twitter account in HISTORY was banned today￼! And So go those 88 million followers. They are going to PARLER.
Please daddy...tell us the story when you were able to say and think as you wanted....ahhhh yes kids....that was a glorious time...it ended right after heels up harris voted to destroy the 2nd amendment.

If you wanna see what they hiding from you on the news might want to check out moc.ecnediveehtsiereh . I had to write it backwards cuz yahoo doesn't want you to see this site. If you don't believe me try typing it forwards and posting it to see what happens.
Twitter stock is down because they ensured that every country outside the US is going to severely regulate or Bna themImagine the UK allowing an ideological San Francisco company to control the BBC. Will India be ok with Twitter having authority to de-platform Modi?
Bye Twitter. Gab 4 Me!! Who's with me??
"Hundreds of rep investors will dump Twitter stock at the opening, this is a coordinated action. I advice everyone to setup stop loss orders."
"The man the created the DOS is now an expert in global affairs?? , Bill, Bob, Jill.., Maybe even an Ellen...Give me $$$$$ , and I will release the Kraken!"
I too have disbanded from Twitter and also Facebook due to self absorbing censorship! Selling all shares of stock.
"I would not touch Twitter. Oh yeah, I bought puts."
Sad news...Rush passed away. He was one of a kind.
"Twitter is so yesterday, the smart money is getting out when the getting is still good."
Support is crumbling...
30% of all Dems thought the election was stolen. Google it. What does that tell you.
"Liberals, please put you life savings in TWTR. Absolutely nothing bad will happen. going to the moon any day now!"
"The guys who coordinated the capital attack, none used Parler. It was done mostly through Facebook, per the fbi."
#DEACTIVATETWITTER

"Love to see investors make money, just not on this company. Twitter has a political agenda and for that reason I hope they fail.￼"
Falling Knife...
Sold my rest of shares... I don’t see an upside anymore and the market will correct soon
We could be trading in the 80's today!! just hold!!
"Not only did Twitter interfere with the election, I have proof that YouTube did as well. Silicone Valley is a bastion of tyrannical oligarchs."
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out anti-First Amendment censorship. Works for the Chinese.
"I deleted my Twitter and moved to mewe and Safechat. For our amendment of freedom of speech, I cannot tolerate Dorsey and these Silicon giants censoring what we can read. If you tolerate their act, be careful what you write in the future because you will next."
"Maria Bartiromo on FBN just said on Friday she reached one million followers on TWTR so she took a snap shot of it, today her followers are down to 911,000.In other words people are leaving in droves ."
"A prediction: Before the end of the current administration ends, Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yahoo will be broken up—or the CCP will have a firm hold on our country. Twitter?—I don’t think it’s relevant enough to matter—absolutely no one I know cares if it exists."
Puts outweigh the calls 3 to 1. Twitter wont see green for awhile...
Twitter analysis on CNBC right now. They are lauding the genius of Jack Dorsey! Stock up 2%...
"Social media platform Twitter has locked the accounts of both Project Veritas and James O’Keefe following a recent report relating to Facebook’s VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen. The platform claims the report violates its policy on “posting private information,” and as a result, both O’Keefe’s personal account and the official account of Project Veritas have been locked, preventing them from posting."
Wouldn’t be surprised to see Twitter open at 30
"Shrinking accounts, shrinking add rev., same overhead, increasing losses followed by a reverse split. Yep, institutions pulling out."
Twitter is better off being at $30 without Donald than at $50 with him. This same logic applies to our country as well.
I am shorting this for America...
Just saw the video of Dorsey (On Tucker Carlson's video) stating he is planning to use Twitter to censor other people also!!! he is NOT American!!! scary!!!
"The first day always seems so bad but when you look back you always think ""I wish I would have sold that day"""
it is your patriotic duty to deactivate and delete $FB and twitter.
Twitter headquarters are located in SF. That explains a lot.
How is that Minnesota freedom fund going. Pay their bail so they can get out and do the same thing. Oh....Supported by Kamala. No wonder crime is going thru the roof.

"Twitter always had a problem monetizing their service which is why the stock really never went anywhere and I agree with Jim that it wasn't smart to ban the biggest draw they had, I'm sure thier share holders appreciate that Jack thought of being a moral cop before he thought of his share holders, that can be the end of a company because the decision making at the top has the wrong priorities for the share holders, he may feel better but his company may now die, their are competitors that will rise that allow free speech."

How is twitters cash flow looking? Looks mighty RED to me.

"The end of Twitter is not near. The decline of Twitter toward a very poor choice among many similar service providers is well underway. The techno-fascist oligarchy is fervently trying to deplatform the emerging providers like Parler. But they will fail because although they have consolidated a great deal of power through monopolistic behavior, the world is waking up the ideological fascism Twitter espouses."

I think there would be a lot of emotional traders shorting this on Monday with rage lol.
This company is like those oily dotcom bust companies from the Y2K era. Smoke and mirrors and nothing behind them. I don't trust a thing Jack and his smoke and mirror guys say. Nothing.

"This country is going to have an ex military and maybe active military problem.. It's already started as several of those in the capitol building are highly trained highly decorated US Military... They took an oath to the constitution and the constitution was not followed with those states changing their election rules/laws.. Even Democrats understand that a rejection rate dropping from 3% to under .5% is not a trustworthy result.. With the number of mailed in ballots, the rejection rate would be UP not Down.."
"Day Traders, why are you still holding this? You have 10 minutes, before it collapses in AH with people trying to ditch it in a hurry,"
There's no denying it now --- TWTR is the digital era equivalent of book burning.

Considering what Dorsey is doing to people who do not have the same political ideology as he... Twitter should crash...which is what he deserves. Too bad others have to suffer for his evil doing.

Time to start boycotting all advertisers on FB and Twitter and stop using Apple products plus cancel your Amazon prime and quit using Amazon. Write/email/text/call (or all of them) the advertisers and tell them you are never buying their products again as long as they advertise on FB and Twitter.

"A real schlapp in the face when Twitter users saw the obvious odal rune shape at cpac. It wasn’t even hidden. German police train school children from 4 on up, on how to recognize these symbols and turn people in. Because Germany is actually smart about the rising Turner-Don Diary movement. I would feel sorry for these cpac-ers, but really why? They promote the white protestsnt work morality. And while I can sympathize with small businesses owners who are strapped, especially during the pandemic, if a profit margin depends on paying employees a wage that keeps them on the edge of poverty if not deep in it, the fault is in the business plan. This holds true for the multi-national, or bank, with their hand out for taxpayer assistance, that isn’t also given to the taxpayer at equal levels. Remember, cpac speakers didn’t want to give any stimulus."
I guess shorts will be safe for the next couple of days.

Look at twitter go
Twitter is going to be the official news source at the re-education camps. They wil have a monopoly on the education of the forced labor for enlightenment.

"Twitter will get crushed for a while, I will sell Monday, short it for a few days/weeks and life will go on. I will pick it up in a few months and go long again. Twitter is an important communication tool and always will be. A few months back a guy shot up a mall. The police weren't sure if he fled the screen or was hiding inside the mall. This was less then a mile from my house so I watched the police press conference. The chief said ""check our Twitter feed"" a dozen times. It's a valuable communication tool and we live in a know everything instantly world. So yes Twitter will be chopped down value wise for a while, but it will be back."

interesting take in this weeks Barron's. Either FB is dramatically undervalued...or TWTR dramatically overvalued...I guess we'll see which one it is in the coming weeks or months.
"Is it fair that the left can still comment on right wing reactions here and voice their opinion, but the right wing can not make comments on more and more platforms every day.?Even the comment section to Yahoo news has been down for months. Too many right wingers contradicting their stories with facts and truth."
Just make sure you go to your settings and DELETE the account. DEACTIVATE.
There is a huge disconnect from valuation to this stock price. I do see light at the end of a dark tunnel and it is an oncoming train.
"Based on Twitter not having all that many users to begin with, they lost millions in America. Under the radar are the millions more overseas who deleted Twitter. With that there’s hardly anything left on the bone yet look at the price. Way too high."
This is great! Sold at 68. Bought March puts!
Last five it should slip
"Comments seem to be disappearing from Yahoo, too.... Censorship = bearish."
I pray that everyone buying puts and shorts this mf makes enough money to donate some to their fellow republican lawmaker. My parler is @DropShock reply with your parler and I will follow back. Ps don't forget to deactivate your twitter account
"Twitter already down in pre-market trading, lol"
"Never went on Twitter and I'll probably be deleting my Facebook too. Be careful what you wish for Lefties, because it could be YOU who is censored one day. Society's new mantra is - shutup and take it and do what you are told. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is dead.Is it not curious that all the big names are dropping Parler in lockstep? Eliminate your competition when you see blood in the water. There's no reason Parler should be shutdown.Whether you know it or not, you are being controlled in order to make rich people richer. Guess who's getting richer during the COVID pandemic? It ain't the average American. It's big corporations, 1%ers, and the D.C. power circle. Draconian restrictions and lockdowns has caused more harm around the world than the virus itself. China. Guess who else has ties with China? Your new President."

It’s rather appropriate that this thing takes a deep dive. It’s lost billions of shareholders money through absolutely horrific management and decision making. The real question is how do freaks like Dorsey get into positions like this??

Never ever invest or use services of politically biased company. Anything you post on left wing social media they don't like will come back to haunt you.
"Companies that don't want to have the rug pulled out from under them by political motivated scoundrels like Amazon Web Services should build and manage their own web servers so that Amazon, Microsoft and other left wing democrat CEOs can't destroy the company by cancelling web services. All companies should learn from what Amazon did to Parler and not rely on companies like Amazon for web services. Best to build your own and not rely on scoundrels for web services."
"It's just starting to sink in for Jack, that Investors, tend generally to be CONSERVATIVES."

"Twitter is old. Looks old, feels old. It's old."
Just love seeing this slowly tank! Dorsey=dope! 
how does anyone American support suppression of free speech.WE ARE NOT CHINA
"sell, sell, sell............................"
"If it were up to me I wish the protestors would stand out front of news media outlets demanding they do their number one job, protecting free speech."
Idaho ISP Blocks Facebook & Twitter...
Everyone be sure to thank a Veteran . They fought for our right to freedom of speech. We as civilians failed them. I for one am ashamed and deeply sorry. They bled on foreign soil for it and we paid big tech to take it away. To any vet reading this thank you so much. I vow to do better
There goes more of the stop losses... lol
"It was reported this morning that the former President is considering an on-line publication similar to The Onion. There is some speculation over its proposed name, with The Turnip and The Rutabago taking bigly favorites. All proceeds from subscriptions will go towards covering Mar-a-Lago maintenance costs, legal fees and general slush fund."
"Everything is going by the book. Twitter announced its acquisition of newsletter platform Revue two days ago, but the company has already begun to integrate the product. Another reason that Dorsey is moving on from the Trumplikins flashback..."
#RIPTwitter is one of the most frequent hashtags now. Wonder why? 'New' business model may not exactly be received with open arms.Save the date => April 29th
"Wait until Jack announces TWTR's been buying Bitcoin, do some homework on it....:)"
yep ... selllllllll itttt!!
Twtr.....great American company! Silenced the orange overload!!
If you are still using Twitter you are now at extreme risk of being targeted by cyber criminal attacks!
Remember when the left wanted everyone to boycott Chick Fil-A?
"Further thoughts on the upgrade... today is the day that margin calls would be completed. If someone had a large Twitter position and needed to dump it, issuing the upgrade today would make lots of sense... Down from here."
Does yahoo pay it's censors $15.00 an hour ?
good time to buy?
"S&P500 should consider replacing TWTR with another tech stock. TWTR doesn’t add value to the index, price never really went above its IPO price, it’s not growing."
How do you filet a tRumpRash steak?
"Bonds? Maybe this firm simply has no money anymore. No ""politics"", just no money. Cash gap? Where can I get the money? Two easy steps. 1. Pump up stocks of $ 80. 2. Selling shares to simpletons for $ 180. ""Give me $ 1 billion. I have nothing to pay my bills with. Our costs are too high, and our income is too small. Please loan $ 1 billion. In return, we will give you our shares. Look - they are now worth $ 80. You won't go wrong."" I think that everything is really bad there. Employees do not receive the full bonus. They told investors about their huge plans (they've slept for 15 years before?). They always have strong competitors. They created new competitors for themselves. The company is unprofitable (but better than analysts predicted :-) No ""politics"", just no money. Bankrupt?"
"Twatter actually said this today: ""Access to information and freedom of expression, including the public conversation on Twitter, is never more important than during democratic processes, particularly elections.#UgandaDecides2021"""
Another dive today. Get out of the stock. It will soon be under $40
What is propping this stock up? Almost everyone I know has stopped using Twitter.
I only come here for the warmth of a stock going down in flames
All time high. Back to pre-January 6th levels. Priceless.
Comrade Xi approves Jacks censorship.
AOC should start talking about a wealth tax on the largest tech companies

What flavor was the kool-aid today?
Will Twtr hit 60 after earning reports ?
last positive earnings for this propaganda company. $20 by EOY. half their users out the door = ZERO ad rev.
How long will it be til' yahoo starts banning finance conversations?
I knew my Yahoo-bias post would disapper --- pronto!
Politics is a tough game welcome aboard Jack
Ask yourself this simple questions. Is Twitter a safe and user friendly platform that has your best interests in mind. Is their a high risk of you being targeted by a malicious group or system currently by simply using Twitter?
Covid death toll in D.C. to expand exponentially in 10 days after today's super spreader inauguration event.

Everything about Hunter's laptop was TRUE yet Twitter still censored and tried to quash the story
"200 mda is just over 39, closer and closer we get"
I hope twitter crumbles........
Headed to under $10 bucks.
LOL.... Falling! Didn’t even take an hour 
It's going to open $80.00 Monday IA
Shouldn’t a company loosing money for so long be in bankruptcy ? They are heading for a shutdown. Workers treated poorly. The caw union is coming.
QUESTION: Should we establish a GoFundMe account to help Parler to purchase their own servers to get back to business?
"It’ll be interesting to see how much control you all have over the market tomorrow? Do you really think you can short TWTR, FB, AMZN into the ground? Why and by how much? This is a serious question...."
"congrats, new shorts! great time to jump into the short bandwagon."
Has twitter moved to China yet. I am sure Xi will give them a prime location where they can continue their censoring practices
incredibly green on a day like today WOW. dont underestimate twitter!! has a place in your portfolio for sure!!
"Twitter will be trading for 30c on the pink sheets in 6 months,"
Think about it. You eliminate 50% of your business an your stock goes up. Could it be those who know are bailing while propping up their stock prices?
$44 ?today
Sinking
"A while back I saw an article trying to estimate the value of Trump to TWTR. This was 4 years ago when the stock was $15. They had Trump at $2 Billion. Add 4 years of growth because of Trump being President, and all the other conservative personalities (who were also deleted, it was NOT only Trump), and all their followers, and replies, retweets, and retweeted retweets, so on and so on. Then look at the profitability of the company, or rather the lack of it. This will very likely swing them to a loss, and if angry conservatives start boycotting advertisers, this could be extremely damaging. This isnt some spineless advertiser caving because of one or 2 angry liberals, this is half the country. While there may be damage tomorrow, the real damage will come over the next few quarters. Neither Trump, nor his 88.7 million followers are ever coming back. Ever. This is a permanent, self inflicted injury by someone with a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders. This will very likely be the largest shareholder lawsuit action history."
Who would pay these prices. when the books say it's worth 1/5 of the current PPS
I love Twitter
"The dementia patient posing as a legitimate POTUS is weak. Iran knows it. Russia knows it. China knows it. Enjoy $4.00 gas this summer and criminal illegal aliens roaming your neighborhoods. Under this poser it's America last and our enemies first. Having trouble getting your Covid 19 shot? Leave the country and enter illegally through the Southern border and you'll get you shot right away. Si señor, señora?"
"The US is focusing on American politicians but the actions by TWTR et al have an international blowback. Basically, people like German Chancellor Merkel have openly stated disagreement with TWTR and others because they see that they could be silenced. But, those countries will shut them down first. Not good for the shareholder value. Too much downside risk."
"sell this stock,support your country Healthcare,buys these stocks tonix,bngo,sens,jagx,will get significant gains in profit in 3 years."
Last one out shut the lights
Not a fan of Twitter. Liberal based...... EW.
I hear the flush..and dorsey is Tiddy bowl
SELL everything that is associated with suppression of free speech unless you appreciate communist control going forward
"Lol! There is an article that states “what’s the better buy, Facebook or Twitter” is this person living in a bubble. These are two of America’s most hated companies. We are canceling our accounts. Twitter is losing money AMD is losing accounts. How’s that going to work?"
"Triple digits handle coming for TWTR. It lagged Facebook for years because they couldn't find ways to make money on the app. Now they are projecting huge revenues so that hurdle is cleared. This will be a HUGE mover in 2021,"
"Fascism is illegal, its time to lock up Jackie."
"Twitter's mission statement:The mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve – and do not detract from – a free and global conversation.Everyone? Really? Everyone except for the POTUS and others associated with him?Notice that Twitter's claim that business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve - and do not detract from - a free and global conversation.So they have just thrown their business model out of the window.Since this company doesn't turn a profit, spends money all kinds of ways, doesn't even really have a mission statement that they are abiding by, why not just dump it?Why do you think there is anything here moving forward?"
3rd time....If hunter was trumps son the press would be on him like killer bees.
Watch big sell off at 3:30PM today massive.
Ouch! Now down 4%.
Isn't it about time for Tramp Stamp Brenda to show up and attempt to pump TWTR to over $50/shr?
What's the dementia patients newest immigration policy? Kids in containers. Covid for all.
"Jack Dorsey, AKA President Xi, has said it was a very tough decision to ban the sitting President from his platform. He also said, in the same breath, “Big Tech is way too powerful”. In fact he did show us all that they are in fact way too powerful"
"I wish our past-President well. Today it's just get up, watch TV, have a berder or three, apply the fake tan and then warm up for a round. Remember, when it goes into the rough a TaylorMade and comes out a Nike, that's not cheating. It's bigly magic!Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Account Got Axed?"
"As an ex-investor of TWTR (sold at $54.45 in December, thank you very much), it's clear they're no longer interested in profits or shareholders. While Dorsey's bagged his mega-millions, his business model is now social engineering. Investor beware."
Cathie woods bought Twitter now ark invest is gonna have to go down
Jack Dorsey's full scale censorship plan for any opinion he and his brownshirts do not like:https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/01/breaking-project-veritas-twitter-insider-records-ceo-jack-dorsey-laying-roadmap-future-political-censorship/
"These big tech company's are gonna learn a valuable lesson, Republican's and conservative's buy stuff too. Now these same company's can watch as Republican's and conservative's take their business elsewhere."
Censoring everyone they don't like

"3.5x normal volume with 20 minutes to go, and pushing a 7% drop. I think its safe to say the attack on the 1st hasn't gone over well. That is if you are a liebral and you are fine with limiting others free speech, ideas and beliefs that don't fit your own. The CCP is proud of you."
My friend called this exactly. He made his profits in the premarket and got out before the market opened.

How is that short working out for you Parler boys?
Proof positive that mixing politics and business/sports is a terrible idea.
Sell as soon as u can this #$%$ has cooked itself.
Jack Dorsey has repeatedly lied to lawmakers about targeting conservatives for censorship.
there's NO climate change....
Is there a class action suit that can be joined?

go go get going. uber already down 3%. this Twitter need to drop faster and catch uber at 3%
The only reason this price gets pumped because tons of shares need to be dumped.

I give Twiter a month and it will be $ 35- $ 38
This will be their last decent quarter this year

I hooe parler comes back soon to get some people off here. lol
"WHAT IF - Conservative Americans started suddenly disappearing from the streets of America, but there was no open, unbiased and objective FREE PRESS to report where they had been taken and what was happening to them? Sound familiar??"
"With the billions joe's wasting on his protection today he could have build a wall from sea to shining sea along the southern border..But it's too late there's a 100,000 migrants on their way to America.Just in time for Joe's free food stamps, healthcare, housing and stimulus checks for everyone...."
"I am seeing Big rotation out of $FB, $TWTR, and $Goog, $Googl and moving into other tech stocks, my entire screen is in green. (Note: I am an independent, sold my social network stocks months ago due to controversies from both parties)."

"Don't delete your Twitter account, GET PERMANTLY SUSPENDED instead!"
I deactivated on the 6th and sold all social media shares when antifa initiated a riot on capitol hill. It was then that confirmed to me we are being manipulated.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS MISSING
$TWTR will be another $M Macy's $5.00 coming. Dont mess with 70 Million americans.
"TRTW might drop to $40 tomorrow. But it may not stop there. If Parler keeps FREE speech, then Twitter will file bankruptcy in 12 months. Twitter users will keep deleting accounts."
In the same week that Twitter banned the hashtag #1984. You can't make this stuff up...
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-11/money-stuff-is-the-twitter-ban-securities-fraud
Propaganda news! Twitter and all the media! China run
Let the Law Dogs eat !
I see twitter is not posting Corona virus testing is declining. Maybe the new administration does not care as much about testing. It was important to them before.
"So far we've been hacked and only seeen a $600 pittance check. Whens Joey gonna get to work? Thought he had a ""plan""? North Korea just displayed an entire nuclear arsenal while Iran is looking to punk our Navy (again). Wheres Joey at? He was President Elect since last month. We have another caravan of immigrants heading to the US. Why's he so quiet?"
"Hard to have a good conversation on ol' TWTR, these days, with half the population delet...er...CORRECTED by the Truth Ministry. Just when you want some pushback...everyone is saying the same thing. Weird, right??"
TWTR has moles how great is that. JACK will need to move quick to have them censored. TWTR appear s to be starting to implode from within its own rank and file.
The green you see today is nothing more than a single life raft for a sinking cruise ship.
Let's short twitter
"I can only imagine the reaction of big Wall St. firms who advised their clients to buy Twitter. This foolish decision by the company will have a very negative and lasting impact on the stock prices. Friday after market slide was just a glimpse of what will happen on Mon. So glad I don't own shares of this company. P.S.: I recommend GILD as a good stock pick -- excellent company, good value and big dividend yield."
"Every once in a while, a trade comes along that is a straight up homerun. Shorting this baby out of the gate on Monday morning is gonna make me some bank."
welfare ronjohn
Word is Insurrect Act of 1807 just signed.
I see this stock in the single digits in less than 6 months. If the only people allowed on Twitter are all in lock step in opinion and thought it will become extremely boring. What ever happened to the concept of diversity? This company has destroyed itself. I’m out tomorrow. Selling out of Apple and Facebook as well. We are not a Marxist country and companies that promote policies against freedom of speech should not be supported. This must stop.
Twitter bans maga we delete Twitter
Keep shorting.
"Jack Dorsey should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, Thank Jack a million times."
How do you unify with a communist ?
"$AMZN - Now that Amazon is being sued by Parler for removing them from their hosting site AWS for allegedly violating Amazon's standards, will they be inclined to remove $TWTR and $FB, two of their largest clients for the same reasons? People post violence and threats all day long on FB and TWTR."
"why didn't joe have 28,000 Social workers protect him today ? and suddendly likes walls ?? Weird"
Wow any negative article on Twitter stock is being banned. Proof right here:https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2021/01/11/twitter-is-the-worst-company-on-planet-earth--heres-how-to-bet-against-the-stock-and-deactivate-your-account/?sh=39d119395ba3

"Get ready for higher inflation, higher gasoline prices', a slowing economy, higher interest rates, a decease in real estate prices, massive debt, a weaker dollar and a stronger China...Enjoy the next 4 years they will make the Carter years look good...."
how is twitter stock going up? by the end of 2021 there will by like 30 accounts left cuz everyone else will have been banned.
"Short Twitter. No profits, no social morality, suppressing freedom of speech, close your accounts!!"
Will bleed all day!
since everybody shorting $TWTR I might as well short it. plus what $TWTR did was kinda messed up.
TRUMP 2024......
"Twitter is self-destructing day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute. Couldn't happen to a more deserving organization."
"The stock market looks very tired, it looks like there will be a correction of 10-15%, and for TWTR still 30%-40% down."
"Perfect example of this company is look at the ""Insider Transactions Reported - Last Two Years""Not one ""purchased"" Every one is SALE and there has been a bunchTells you that the insiders are using this company as a piggy bank and not interested in growth"

"There is no protection for children on Twitter. I had to ban my 13 year old son from using Twitter, after he began to get naked pictures of men sent as dm's. It said clearly on his account that he was 13 and wanted to chat with other kids who played Playstation games. Twitter is a playground for pedo's."
"They have been plummeting for a while. The only thing between them and a bunch of lawsuits is 230.Already sold, big drop coming Monday. SHORTInvest in alt platforms.You make a platform you grow, thanks capitalism, then you turn commie, nice."
Do not buy puts. Actually short the stock. Puts wont do it.
100 contracts ready on puts time to say hello to my freedom!!

Latest news on Twitter: Marjorie Taylor Greene has appealed to Jack Dorsey for mercy to be allowed back on the Blue Bird.
I think Twitter and Amzon made a serious financial mistake. I guess that's what happens when power goes to your head. Looks like Parler is the pin to burst their inflated heads.
"I have DEACTIVATED my twitter account several times few days back, but Twitter won't deactivate it. It shows still active."
I sold all mine at twitter and close my account with twitter and I am asking all to do the same. This is for Our freedom and constitution.
Huge Lawsuits coming so long Twitter Facebook and eventually Google!!! Cannot wait! get the popcorn out!
Why is it still green?
not going to be good for 2 to 4 years. back to $20
"Expect a number of positive recs from analysts in the coming days to support those large investors, institutions and mutual funds who have large investments in this Mao Company. Remember they did they for Enron as it was collapsing."
"twitter has no future, if anything it'll eventually fragment into a sort of Uber left version of itself and 40%+ of its userbase will find their way somewhere else."
I’m getting rock hard just thinking about this stock going down and down. Dorsey is a poor excuse for a man.
"deleted my Twitter also.. get woke, go broke."
"$100 million buys you the best food, resorts, houses, travel... Since the world is finite, by the time you are up to $20 billion, it's the same stuff. So what do you do when your increasing wealth won't buy better stuff? You switch over to influencing and controlling other humans because everything else is achieved and nothing else matters. You could take a homeless man with a long beard and put him in as CEO of Twitter, and he will quickly become a censoring neocom like the rest of them. Carol Burnette was asked why she didn't mock republicans, and she said ""why would we chase away half of our audience?"" But marx-like censorship offends half of a company's users, the stock price skyrockets. The horse is already out of the barn and the pigs are up and walking on their hind legs. I wouldn't short this stock because that would make logical sense."
Removed twitter and Facebook from my phone. Already happier.
geez anybody that looks like this we should trust?
$20 tomorrow?
"So you want me to invest in a company which makes no profits, declared a LOSS of $7.44 Million at Quarterly Earnings, and yet somehow managed to give BLM $10 Million? You should be on TV with gags like that..."

Short this to the core of the earth
"Starting next quarter, will TWTR start reporting how many suspended accounts they have? Will these still be counted as active subs?"
Dorsey is going to loose more that 50% of his business in the next 3 months
the washington post reported the potus four new priorities ...#1. public housing in the suburbs.#2 cut medicare benefits #3 Ban guns #4. ban drilling for oil.......I hope the old folks are paying attention....
TWTR bought calls for about a million shares in March at 75 strike.
"I quit Twitter 2 days ago after joining in 2013. I will eventually short both TWTR & Square stock. Not right away, but be patient, wait until you see the numbers lost during their earnings call, will be in the tens of millions. Bottom line is Twitter is really just a cesspool of people spewing their meaningless views. It’s trash "
"I was a long term investor in Twitter. For me, this company is dead. Sold what I had with profit. (Before hate, I’m not American but freedom of speech is way more important than politics or money)."
Hedge funds buying twtr hand over fist at this price.
"""Hit the road, Jack. And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more...."""
The shorts are just getting started. All on board. Let's party will Twitter sinks like the Titanic...
This is what you get when you censor more than half of America.Believe it or not...... We are the silent majority!
users number contracted. not a good sign.
I’m making a genuine plea to all people with a modicum of common sense. Please deactivate your accounts and sell any stock you have in this miserable company with its outrageous and despicable Management.
Has the Mango Mussolini had his oak leaf laurel gold-plated yet? Bigly?

I hope this stock goes to the pink sheets! Gfy!
"Wow. Can you see advertising dollars disappearing as now those that advertise must realize that they are appealing to people who know people who know people. Why would anyone buy products or services unless you are one of those in favor of the #cancculture? Dorsey has fully expose his tyranny to all. So out of touch with the common man/women and the heart of what makes America, America."
Down 10% today. TENS of millions will cancel this week. Plus million will be selling their shares. What Twitter did was wrong. Enjoy the ride DOWN.
I set price alert at 20
"something stopping it to go below $46...my prediction is once it does, it will free fall..."
In hindsight we can clearly see the drag on this company was the twitterer in chief who got booted and then the rocket ship launched.
You can buy twitter for $100 in 2021. How much is that a share.
"what do we need twitter for anyway. we are exposed to boots and propaganda and can get fired for a post someone find offensive years later. AND they mine our data and it gets leaked, sold, and/or hacked.what is the upside?"
"to bad us retail cant trade at 4am, gonna be bad"
Deactivated my account
How you Parler peeps doing tonight. Are you still trying to take over the country? Joe can’t wait to meet you!
Seems Twitter is underperforming against the markets of the last month.
Twtr has constituted itself a domestic enemy with unconstitutional policies
"Continue to sell, sell, sell, protect your Freedom of speech, get out of this stock, it is going down."
When a CEO manipulates the stock price should not the SEC step in and halt trading?
Twitter sabotaging itself is saddening. Already struggling to engage teenagers thanks to tik tok & others. Will never recover
Our troops forced to sleep in a parking garage while the refugees enjoy 5 star accommodation on your dime. It’s a liberal thing.
"In all the years I have been investing, I have never shorted any stock. But I may want to very soon. Im thinking Twitter and Facebook are both losing subscribers now. And when Parler comes back on line at the end of the month, many more subscribers are likely going to leave those two jokes of ""social platforms""..."
Buying this Stock is like buying a ticket on the Titanic the week before it left Port.
"I just can't see how #TWTR survives going forward. It's not as fun as SNAP, IG or TikTok and its not as interactive and comprehensive as Facebook. It's not as useful as texting, WhatsApp, or ZOOM. And it just removed its #1 content creator. It's basically the AskJeeves of social networks which makes sense since it came out before the iPhone."
"People never left, never sold. All talk."
make twtr great again!
"Lets see if u lose half of your 187 million users, do u lose have your revenue from advertisers soon, did twitter cut its expense in half today-no , so why is the stock not $25."
down 20% already !! let’s make it 50%!!! take Dorsey on a reality check!
TWTR is in good hands of shorts .
Put a noose around Mike Pence's neck? Why is Twatter allowing such content on its platform to continue? Censorship is a one-way street for the Twatter brownshirts.
Amazon AWS taking down Parler tomorrow. That's their new reality. Ours is all of these socialists/marxist/globalist/DeepState/MSM/SocialMedia cabal is about to feel the truth on their crimes.
"This will backfire. Letting college idealists run a viable business is, in the long run, not profitable."

"Hey longs, get out of this now. It's going to collapse."
Under $45 today. Sell Sell Sell
Drop yahoo for deleting comments!
Amazing this stock is still this high. FB and TWTR clearly want to have their own power over our civil rights. Treat them as a publisher.
On paper this stock should be worth zero. They have no viable product. Twitter is just an extension of the Democratic Party propaganda machine. Wake up people. Stock being propped up by desperate traders who are long o nthis dog.
wow
GOOD MORNING SHORTSWe have a Beautiful head and shoulders on the 1 yr. the chart is showing a retrace to 42. watch for a break below 44
"My sister thinks that socialism is great, and says everyone should be equal. Then she goes out and purchases a new Lexus! My parents tell her that she won't be able to purchase new cars like a Lexus if marxism being spewed by MSNBC, CNN, Huffington Post, NYT, Yahoo, Google, AOC, Bernie, Nancy, Schumer, and other leftists prevail. She told them that they don't know what they're talking about and have been watching too much Fox news. She proceeded to say all it takes is for the top 1% to pay their fair share and for corporations to give all of their earnings to their employees and the government. Unbelievable! MSNBC is all her and her husband watch 24/7."
This stock should be in the range $38-42 like it did right after Q3 earnings!! Q4 earnings are no better than Q3's.
"I paid my house taxes and hoa at the weekend, using the profits I got from SHORTING Twitter."
"The maga bashers keep on bashing but twitter publishes a good report. Not excellent, but good, very clearly"

This is what happens when our country gives out fake degrees to fake lawyers from fake policies...aka affirmative action....fake professors giving out fake grades to pass their brain washed students. and here we are.
Hahaha.... Twitter worst performing stock in the S&P so far -12% YTD Great job!
3 dollar stock come this summer.
Dropping... Traders taking their profits and getting out before the open.
Bye
I hear a lot of Twitter employees are not too happy with Jack
"Makes sense. Market up 2%, and TWTR decides not to participate. I've gotten used to this. I hate twitter....but, will probably never sell any more than I have already unloaded."
39 by the end of Tuesday27 by end of week.
I guess we can be green everyday. lol
leftist are misinformed.....reprogram them now....
Jack Dorsey really SCREWED shareholders BIGLY with his little tweet rampage yesterday! I’m not Dem or Repub but after his admission yesterday that Twitter has too much power I definitely SOLD MY SHARES THIS MORNING!$FB $AAPL $SNAP $AMZN
"Question: are people going to continue to invest in massively inflated stocks like Twitter, or will money increasingly flow into precious metals, real estate, and solid stocks with substantial dividend yields? I believe bubble stocks like TWTR will burst in the near future."
The Day Traders must be mad trading this. Watch them ditch this though before market closes. NO one in their right mind wants to be holding this until Tuesday.
"In my opinion, I’m not sure Jack Dorsey is mentally fit to run Twitter. Politics aside, I am buying puts and shorting."
short to the floor
Deleted acct for TWTR this evening. Banning free speech today. 1/2 of accounts will delete very soon.Wish I had shorted this today should have been able to predict this move.
Stevie Ray is an insurgent and enemy of the state! It posts disinformation about our government under dozens of aliases. Please report IT to Yahoo! TIA! 
I will not use Twitter ever again
The Demon-crats Minister for Propaganda Jack Dorsey makes a public appearance.
"Institutionals getting ready to sell, once all the suckers have placed their purchase orders…"
"What happens when parlor is back and, on top of it, Gab's phone with its independent operating system (that allows Parler) starts to sell like hot cakes."
A lot of puts expired today worthless from keeping the price above $72.00.
It’s time to bring down these big tech! Wold wide sell out!
Sell TWTR. Revenues and earnings dropping. Eventually this drops a lot!
Don't be tricked into buying at this price by Jack. You will lose money when the market opens. Opening red.
"An old man with dementia and a h0^ker walked into a bar. Hold on this isn't a joke, it was the inauguration..."

Wish I had puts on this
Dump this stock. It is just a cog inthe communist machine.

Twitter finally free!!!! Go go fly blue bird..!
Made enemies on both sides of the political spectrum. Get out while you can.
"Timber Timber exactly, censor these Techs right of business and out profile"
"F twitter, banning free speech. Sell now"
"Oppenheimer’s Jason Helfstein’s statement that he’s not concerned about the decision to silence Trump shows his ignorance—or possible deception (i.e., should he be attempting to exit under cover of an upgrade). Dorsey risked disenfranchising roughly half of the US market, when the future of Twitter—a company that has yet to prove it’s staying power—is in question. Does anyone really feel that TWTR is important or necessary? Trump might have seen it as important once—but who else other than a boatload of forgettable self-absorbed people trying to make themselves relevant?"
The so called green jobs as planned by current administration will ultimately be China Jobs (e.g. made in China). Wait & see.
Yesterday January 12 TWTR lost 5 billion in market capital. India looks appears to be taking a stand against Twitter the whole company is going to be banned from the whole country. Which has a population of over 1 billion.Question is how many people from india have a Twitter account?
"Joe can't hide behind fences, 35,000 guard, and 40,000 armed police forever. Or does he intend to try and run the nation from his basement, same as he ran his campaign of electoral theft?"
Libbs couldn't pull out of anything....they just have abortions....referring to RonJon aka ronnie's comment 16h ago......
Parler is having network troubles now... It's being taken offline by communist Amazon..
"Twitter has entered into a binding agreement to settle the shareholder derivative lawsuits that accused CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives of misleading shareholders about Twitter’s growth, while selling their own personal stock.The lawsuits were first filed in October 2019 by shareholder Jack Porter, and accused Dorsey and his colleagues of misrepresenting the growth of Twitter’s (TWTR) user base and artificially inflating the share price.Porter accused the defendants of exploiting their positions and selling “their personal stock holdings for hundreds of millions of dollars in insider profits” while possessing material, non-public information.The proposed settlement absolves Dorsey and his co-accused of any wrongdoing without any liability attributed to them or the company.As part of the agreement, Twitter will implement certain corporate governance adjustments and will pay for certain administrative costs. The company will not be required to make any additional payments.In addition, under the terms of the settlement, Twitter’s insurers will pay $38 million to the company that will be used for general corporate purposes. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion initiated a Hold rating on TWTR last week and set his price target at $45. This implies downside potential of around 6% from current levels."
Amazing a public company just gave the middle finger to 100m people.This is the end of twitter
"44's Tuesday, lower it goes faster it depreciates. Trick is to get as many bag holders on way down to cushion bottom."
"I wonder if shareholders can sue the corporate officers for becoming involved in politics in a way that DESTROYS the company? Can investors sue? If so, twitter will be locked up in the courts for the next 10 years. I have deleted 2 twitter accounts and my facebook."

Wait for the morning lull in about an hour. It will show no mercy as this stock plummets and NEVER recovers. Half the users are gone now. The advertisers will also walk away. Twitter has no business model.
"Biden while running for President, “I’m gonna stomp out the virus, crush it.” Crazy Joe today, “there’s no way we can stop this virus.” Good ol politics ; )"
Market opened at $65.80 ... Lol
Cathie Wood of Arc Investment increased position in Twitter. This will double by end of this year.
Lots of political rant about Twitter. My issue is that it’s perhaps detrimental to hear from people in blips and blurbs through out the day. There’s no real need for it. Society is just getting used to social media. All social media have challenges. But I feel like Twitter even more than others appeals to people’s worse angels. So for that reason and at this price I’m not a fan
"Jack Dorsey Please note A clear and unambiguous signal- Put option volume increasing relative to calls....Jack,,,,, I suggest you bring an extra pair of jockey shorts to the office,"
CNBC stated that Trumps followers make up 47% of twtr subscribers. If that is the case this stock should be down more. What do you think.
"It's less about Jack banning the President and more that he is able to ban whoever hurts his feelings. If TWTR is able to censor the New York Post for an accurate story without doing any research or validation, they can do this to anyone. It sets a precedent that can be used against those who now support it. Remember the Reid Rule??"
"The drop is in progress. Low 61s and if it closes the after hours in the 60s, premarket will see the ugly truth come out in the form of a major drop n the stock price."

Don’t open a position in TWTR until you hear what (http://Rightpicker.com) has to say about it. These guys give amazing insights like no other service.
"When the market makers realize inflation is very real (gas prices, bond yields, housing values, cost of consumer good, etc.) and the labor market is still weak, this will get ugly very fast.We have already had two major tremors in a week.

Generally I feel bad when people lose money but if you support Fascist Media it's well deserved

I hear that Twitter is being investigated for RICO charges.
Hedge funds are beginning to jump ship...
Jack Dorsey intentionally and willfully torpedoed his own company. But it’s not his to do that with anymore. It belongs to millions of people owning those 751 million shares.In discussing with legal experts all of us who have been impacted negatively would be wise to form the largest class action suit in history.
Timber!!!
"Google and Apple are banning parler so find an alternative to them too. Turn off, tune out, and terminate your twtr and fb accounts."
"Jack Goebbels has opened pandora's box. Now that he has gone full monty in the censorship realm, govts. around the globe beckon him to mute foes. And, of course, he does. Where it stops no one knows."
I have cancelled my twitter and FB and will never return to them.
Dropping like a rock -- good riddance
"Amazon web services is not the only web service providers in the World. Other companies are selling web services so parler can goto Amazons competitors but parler can also build their own web servers and not rely on left wing run companies like Microsoft, Amazon etc. and therefore not need Amazon or Microsoft to flourish and then parler can ban liberal democrat companies from using its web services."
$6 billion of market value wiped out in 7 trading days. Ouch!

Most importantly we need a place/website for those who have a voice become censored and there will be many. We seen this on the news articles, and we will see it on this format soon. Many of you younger Conservatives/people with US traditional values are way smarter than me, but I hope you get the general idea and stand your ground!"

Do 45 Fanboys still want to short Twitter? 
We should learn from our past. The country cannot thrive or survive so divided. Very sad and both sides should be worried for the country.
And the hits keep on coming. 45’s Mar-A-Lago helipad is being demolished. Sorry Fanboys. 
be a true AMERICAN and close your twitter accounts and sell stock!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jack not sleeping well tonight
It's no accident the CEO looks a like Carl Marx. One thing in the U.S.A is we as American's can invoke Capital Markets punishment on the Stock by Selling TWTR to Bankruptcy which indeed will occur over the Next 6 months when it's only major client and voice of the last four years leaves. It was going to happen anyway their was no way that Trump Organization would not be setting up it's own media networks day's after the President left office anyway. The CEO of TWTR knew that and so did we. The U.S. Capital Markets will invoke justice on TWTR. Then they will get it!
"Since all other countries are completely banning TWTR, it still has long way to rank from here! What a guaranteed shorting win! "
"It's Thursday, February 4, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today???"

Twatter is probably financially tied to Antifa and BLM
Defund media
Going up big tommorow!!
"TWTR and FB need to be regulated. We need a law to require every social media account to be verified by a drivers license and the name you use on the account needs to match the license. Also the name needs to be fully public on your profile, comment posts and so on. No more anonymous accounts."
Shares go up when earnings are missed. Shares go down when earnings are beat. This market really makes absolutely no sense lol

"President going to make EMERGENCY BROADCAST In next couple days. Any company that suppress his message will lose their LICENSE. Also, criminal charges. Let’s see if big tech has more power than the government. Twitter will be no more if they block the upcoming broadcast."
It's clear that twitter is going down the echo chamber road.. The masses will not pay to join the Twitter Nazi party..

"Twitter is going to lose license, sell before you lose all you got! Just matter of time."
There's no reason to hold this stock...sell while you can get a decent price for it now.
TWTR and FB lost $16B and $75B respectively so far by banning Trump.... so who are taking who down here?
To all Twitter shareholders please get out now as soon as possible

"So many people have left, Dorsey and Twitter is done. What a mistake!"
Just heard on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that Twitter has just cancelled Senators Graham and Graham. Twitter is doubling down on their attack on free speech.
"With all sincerity the average investors much prefer Apple stock for a long hold. TWTR exhibits extreme volatility which attracts day traders like me who have no real interest in the company, except in this case Dorsey has personally offended me."
fake news to bring stock up.... doesn't matter 10 year yield is going up and scaring investor...market continues to fall until the Fed manipulatites the yeild curve next and this stock will get hit hard with tech

If you read the Parler update on the website it’s very clear that the CEO of Parler is a far superior thinker and person than the Twitter CEO.
Small fortune loss in the last two days.....big tech. will not beat Trump....I am just sad that innocent shareholders became cannon fodder in Jack Dorsey's losing war.......MAGA FOREVER

ssssssssssssss.....sound of advertisers leaving....Load up on puts Monday! Twitter who??
Couldn't dump my stock fast enough
A lot of people will or have cancelled their Twitter account; just as a lot of people decided to not invest in $TWTR any longer - sell any stock and don't invest in an ETF or a Mutual Fund that contains it. Both will impact the share price. Lot's of other places to invest and make $.
$TWTR I did not realize Jack Dorsey was also the CEO of $SQ - yikes.
Hold those short positions ! Last 8 trading days down and together we can sink this !Institutions are hedging there bets
I hope the stock tanks!

This legislation is the sequel.The first round of legislation would enact a $100,000 daily fine for any platform found to be de-platforming political figures and candidates for office."

To close your Twitter account go to settings and privacy. Then hit account select deactivate. Then key in your password. Now you can remove your app from your device's.
Twitter needs to be banned.

"I admit I have never used Twitter and had to do some research on what value it has. I am baffled as to why people need a social media avenue that seems to divide our country. After accessing Twitter, I an glad I never got involved in the drama. You have to ask yourself are you a better person with Twitter in your life? The healing won't begin until services like this get some controls."
Dorsey: 'This Is Going to be Much Bigger Than Just One Account'
No regrets on exiting my position.This is heading back to upper 20's if not lower.This is a garbage app that was given life over the last 4 years...They thought they were more relevant than they actually are.
"Mr. Jack Dorsey from $TWTR and $SQ, the right to freedom of opinion is of fundamental importance, NEVER forget that,freedom of speech will always WIN, big money or big tech must focus on business and innovation, not banning people because they have an opinion... right or wrong is up to the people to decide , think twice! GLTA"

I just deactivated my Twitter account and deleted the app from my phone like many others here. I just don’t like the thought that they have the power to deactivate and ban me if they so wish. I tend not to hang out where I’m not welcomed unless I relinquish control of my basic rights as a human being. I don’t own this stock and never will.
Trading view has STRONG SELL on twitter.
"I just read that the NY Post has instructed it's journalists to not use CNN, MSNBC, WaPro and NYT as primary sources. This is very good. I think there will be more to follow their lead. Basically, the NY Post is censoring CNN, ,MSNBC, etc. as primary sources. YES!!!!!"
"Note for those who in the money here:- Protect your gain - Think about it, who is buying now? What are the price prospects.Politics aside, most people are here to make $$$, not lose $$$ unless I am missing something.Good-luck."
"Cancel Twitter, Google and Facebook.Or They Will Cancel You.Sell your Twitter stock now before it's too late."
You might be a seditionist if:1. You didn't want young americans serving in endless combat for decades overseas2. You wanted America to preserve its manufacturing base and jobs3. You wanted domestic energy independence instead of supporting regimes that persecute gays and trample civil rights4. You wanted low taxes to make domestic business more competitive.5. You thought a fine for not buying health insurance from private companies was unfair.6. You believe it's important to stand with and support one of the few democracies in the middle east.These are the hallmarks of a #$%$ begone you evil insurrectionists.

Delisted 2021!!!!
"JIM COLLINS Jan 15, 2021 | 11:45 AM ESTStocks quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good!"
Only dems can rationalize that paid member growth slippage and increasing expenses are not as important as a slight increase in revenue. Twitter will fade away because of its one sided views and disrespect of the only president that really worked for all of the people. Someday a great black leader is going to day that and it will open the eyes of many.
you think Dorsey cares about the share holders?
Politics aside. This company doesn’t make any money/thing! How is the price even at this level?
"If you are on the RMS Twitter, I recommend abandoning ship. This ship is sinking, india is banning Twitter inside the county which is the 3rd largest user of Twitter. Insiders are selling off. Jack Dorsey is currently incoherent, what ever ""REEEEEEE"" means."
I sold twitter at 54 months ago LMAO. Glad I did!
"Shorting this from now on. It should be and must be an opportunity to express yourself. Freedom of speech? I think Twitter lost their core daily user by this move. We all know that what he/other did was wrong, but come on... Norway."
$3 Billion written off so far. Dead cat bounce won't last the morning lull. lol
"Veritas has now released a video from a whistle blower that Jack Dorsey stated he is going to continue to censor conservatives as a larger project going forward. The video is posted on gateway pundit for investors to see. If I didn't know any better I wold swear Jack Dorsey is on a suicide mission involving Twitter. As a result I see Twitter continuing it's downward spiral which is roughly down 18% off the highs on January 6th. I don't see that changing as Twitter will reach the thirties over the coming weeks. This film won't do investors any good who believe Jack should try and repair those on the right which make up half of the nation. My guess is that Twitter lost at least 44 million of the 88 million subscribers who followed Trump. So you might say the ""Cancel Culture"" cancelled Twitter!"
"The drop in artificially inflated Big Tech companies like Twitter will be long and steep. If you have a profit in TWTR, better sell to protect it before in quickly vanishes. Just trying to be neighborly."

"If they can censor the president if the united states, what stops them from censoring you? It’s the principle"
Twitter is basically just one big r/politics echo chamber subreddit at this point
I suspect that once the Institutional holders break ranks the decline will be massive. No way this company has any real value.
The government don’t like companies who has more power over its citizens than them. This was an eye opener for them. They will break this company apart just as they did with big oil in the early 1900’s. Sherman Antitrust Act guarantee!
What about Kim little rocket man ? Going to give him a plane load of cash ?
Wait and see what the plummeting add revenue does to this stock.
Why is Twitter up again? It’s not fair.
"Over 10,000 of my followers on Twitter disappeared since last weekend. Their accounts are completely gone, if you click through to them. I will ALSO be deleting my account end of the week, just keeping it open for now to monitor the drift of people OFF THE PLATFORM. Not posting any tweets now. BOTTOM LINE IS THEY'VE GONE, and most of them were not political people."
"It's just the beginning of censorship, here is a video recording from project veritas, recording the non-elected Vijaya and Jack and her plan to widen the censor. ---https://twitter.com/i/status/1351197663878918155"
Yahoo objects to the term control freaksI wonder why?
Some people won’t be able sell in the 40’s when the market opens. Too many sells/shorts.

I quit Twitter permanently after being on from the beginning. Parler is where I have gone.

I really think Jack Goebbels Dorsey is getting tired of Twatter. You can tell the distractions it's causing him from keeping focused on grooming his beard and nose rings. I look for him to end up selling Twatter for anyone who takes it once it dives to the $5-$10/share region.
Never trust a middle aged man with a Taliban beard and a nose ring when it comes to business.

Great day to short while the stock is up.
The people have spoken on their retaliation to cut their investment and take out their shares of Twitter for banning a permanently banning US president. What they did to him is a disgrace and an attack on Freedom Of Speech. I don’t have any shares but if I did I would sell all of it completely before it drops really low.
Down more and more yes
Close at the low of the day?
Good luck to all......https://youtu.be/ILo3yA5sNYg

Wouldn’t it just be best for the country if social media didn’t exist?
TWTR has $41 BILLION in mkt cap with just $3.6 billion in revenue. Earnings are negligible. The $52 stock price has a long way to fall. Karma.
"75 million people , plus people around the world hate twitter and commi dorsey , going to 15$?"
TWTR baggies gonna lose alot of money on Monday. I for one am happy to be a part of shorting this all the way to the pink sheets.
"Twitter, Facebook, Google Apple have been colluding for a while with each other and refer to each other multiple times as ""PEERS"". They are not peers they are competitors. Any action together as peers violate Anti Trust laws but more importantly have recently lead them to act on their own feelings instead of what is in the best interest of their shareholders. I really think those hurt by Jack Dorsey's incompetence should start a class action and sue Twitter."
"The shorts will kill Twitter. Going to happen. Twitter, Facebook and Google have forgotten that most of the nations money is in the hands of Republicans and legal voters who are actually alive and work for a living."
"Uganda bans Twitter, hopefully other countries will follow. Sell Twitter before it's to late."

Due to that reason--as Mr. Wonderful on Shark Tank says, ""I am out!"". BOL.PS: With bi*** coin going the way it is, I might as well pull my funds from SQ too.

8 years after IPO company still doesn’t know how to make money.
Yahoo just took down my post about the BLM Activist who has been arrested for invading the Capitol and egging on others to do damage. It was a set-up people.
"Why isn't this censorship rotting commie bird decomposing and dropping like a bird that got shot out of the sky? P.S. I hate communism. Now, will Yahoo censor me? If yes I will flag 100+ commie/extreme liberal posts as ""inappropriate"" or ""does not belong here"" or as ""spam""."

Twitter is a buy at $25.00
Of course it is
Twitter is suspending accounts so they can't delete them and show the world how everybody feels..DELETE Your account
An article from Seeking Alpha from 2 days ago said that at the end of Q3 TWTR had 187M users. Wanted to share this number because it will give us a baseline to see what percentage of the people delete their accounts.
Sell this stock. Protect freedom
Unfortunately I see a future where liberals only shop at businesses that support their views. The liberal economy will be in ruins as conservatives continue to pay for their welfare checks.

"After I deactivated my Twitter and FB accounts, I feel liberated. So much peace now!"
"I for one was never into social media; so I did noot have to ""leave"", but hearing what these big tech is doing, and thinking they can get away with it, I hope those of you who are leaving or have just left understand that Twitter and other similar entities realize they are in the wrong ONLY because they are losing money, and that they will change their ways, that you will NOT go back to them. It's up to you of course but when people are apologetic ONLY because they realize they are making money, and you as consumers go BACK to them, they still win. My hope is that once you leave, you leave for good."

This stock has got to go! Freedom of speech has got to live
TWTR is today's Tokyo Rose. An incredible source for forms of propaganda. Opinion without truth or verification. Amazing they are allowed to operate as they do.
No one really needs twitter or facebook.....you may have a happier life by actually getting back to life without social media.
Jack wins Monty Pythons Twit of the Year
"Twitter is growing regardless of what you say, it’s where all the political and famous people show their thoughts. It’s the best and only place for that. It’s that simple. Cya in 5 years, sell your shares to me."

wouldn't be surprised to see this go back down to the 20's
Twitter banned the hashtag #1984 earlier this week. Oh the irony...
Most shareholders are base in the US and most doesn’t agree with this type of suppression. Twitter will regret this.
"I uninstalled the app from my phone. Frankly, I don't need it. I don't think Dorsey actually cares about the share price."

Twitter and Jack Dorsey represent a massive American success story. Good for them. Good for the U.S. of A.

How come twitter never removed any Black Lives Matter posts that organized many many riots that resulted in 29 deaths and 4 billion in damage?

It's been a few years now and I've almost given up hope. I mailed a generous donation check to the Dennison Foundation because I believed in their fine work with Children's Cancer Centers and Disabled Veterans Groups but have yet to receive my Dennison University diploma in the mail.I'm beginning to think I've been bigly had. Opinions? I'm thinking of hiring Rudy Giuliani to sue on my behalf.
"what happen if 50 millions account users turn into a class action lawsuit? that will be huge and ... possible these days. I don't own any of TWTR stock and not a fan of Trump but a private company should do business only. If they don't like what Trump does then they need to seek some kind of authority (somewhere and somehow, like Nacny, she is hungry of power, will give a bless if TWTR asks for one!). Why you mess your business with politics. What happen next will be lawsuit dismiss liability protection from social networking company. that will be a big loss for FB and TWTR. Google and Apple will be next too."
I'd like to ask every one to download some ad blocker software. This will help your PC run faster and hurt Google (another of the big tech titans trying to influence what we see/hear). Just a thought. I

"Twitter has purged over 70,000 accounts they deemed unfit. President being number 1 on that list. Now whole countries are banning Twitter. Twitter saying how could you ban us?  pretty hypocritical of Twitter. Get out of Twitter stock because on the 20th their domain will be no more. Wake Up!!!!￼"
I own a lot of Twitter shares and have for a long time. They are all being sold Monday I hope this crashes.
10 dollars a share will be here shortly.
Was really hoping the stock would drop a lot more than 6% today well there's always tomorrow
what ever made Dorsey think hes God
My dog just defecated on a liberal newspaper with Jack Dorsey and Nancy Pelosi on the same page. A Double-whammy.
Company is not making any money. Just imagine their 1st quarter ER would be like when millions of users deactivate their accounts.
Another good day in the National Socialist Twitter Workers' Party.

Investing in Twitter isn't good for your finances. Good thing I predicted this would happen.
"MySpace fell because there was no user base when FB came online. They lost their user base. Same thing happening with $TWTR. Lost a bunch of users and hasn't been profitable.I, on the other hand, have profited off their options. They will make lots of money while they tank"

"Banning individuals and denying free speech by $TWTR $GOOG $APPL $FB will not be tolerated. It is the surest sign that big tech needs to be broken up. Consolidation and concentration of any type of power (power, money, influence) inevitably lead to abuse of that power. Ironic that GOOGs first motto was ""do no evil."" They may all think they are too big to fail. I guess that depends on how you define ""fail."" In my opinion, they just did."
What are the estimates for how much this will fall on Monday? 30%? 50%?

80% of time I did not agree with Trump but to have TWTR remove the US president from the platform is a disgrace. Founding fathers made sure all citizens have the right to free speech. It is called the US constitution Mr Dorsey. This is a dark moment in our history. Conservatives need to create their own platform. I also say time to break down big business such as AMZN. They did it to Standard Oil. AMZN should be next

"Ronald Reagan, in one of his more famous speech (and one of his most accurate I might add) stated, AMD I quote. ""If facism ever comes to America it will come in the name of Liberalism"".

What was Twitter before Trump? Nothing. What will it be after Trump? Nothing. Why are you investing in a sinking ship?
"Not a huge drop like I expected, but wait until they release their quarterly numbers and have to reveal the. Umber of subscriber/users they last for the quarter. The day of reckoning is still coming. There’s still lots of room to go down before you can say the bad news is already built into the stock price."

Cancel Twitter. Sell the stock
Get out of here. This will go bankruptcy.
sell stock
I hope social media companies drop like a rock
I thought freedom of speech is when you can voice a different perspective on truth. The research you do to make a winning stock trade should also be made in how you understand the news ! Follow a variety of news outlets and watch a half hour each day of MSNBC FOX CNN and even 15 minutes of NEWSMAX. By doing this you will have a great balance on what the truth is. If you follow news on the net such as Twitter or Facebook and focus on as many as two similar articles whether positive or negative those platform's algorithms will feed you similar stories backing up the same view. This puts people in a herd of thinkers that could follow lies and false beliefs. These algorithms are not acceptable to freedom of finding the truth ! It could lead many down a dark rabbit hole. Many who lost work because of covid shut downs seemed to want to follow reasons why they lost their jobs. Its because of covid and I feel their pain. Just as the algorithmic codes run the stock market we still do our research to see the truth.please understand sites like Twitter and Facebook haven't focused on what's true because they make greater fees if they take you down whatever rabbit hole you choose. Remember your worth more than your financial success. Things will get better you have to have social emotional physical and spiritual success in your life to be balanced. I know most or at least many feel financial success may be the greatest of them all ! Know that covid has tested each of us and many are fed-up with life ! This time in our history will soon pass and brighter days are ahead.
"So all that money that was handed to BLM, where is it? Is it true that it found its way into the bank accounts of the three RACIST MARXIST hags who run that organization. We should be told. Seriously Jack, what happened to that $10 Million of SHARE-HOLDERS MONEY you gave them?"
Twitter is overrated as a communication platform
Next step is to contact the top advertisers for twitter and let them know you will not purchase their products if they continue advertising on Twitter . nestle is their biggest advertiser - so let go citizens
Look like they are layoff 25% workforce next quarter coming ..good luck long..
Lose half of your Twitter users ?? Great business plan

"So now the left is trying to cancel GME, and any other heavily shorted stock that might get squeezed. It's working about as well as Jack's censoring and chasing off half or more of good customers!"
Jack off Dorsey and the radical left want total control over public discourse. Please deactivate your accounts and sell any shares you have in this cesspool.

BIG STENCH coming from WASHINGTON
"Just got rid of Amazon. will work on getting weaned from FB, Google, Twitter, and Apple tomorrow or however long it takes. Also created two new email addresses using proton. As for search engine still looking. Any ideas out there?"
Funny people dont understand TWITTER IS OVER .... whoever buys now is toasted
The rollover is in play. There are many attractive investment options. Why would anyone stay here unless you're on the short side? Is it a TDS hangover symptom?
The Exodus of big Tech. GAB is running slow because of a million new users a day. Telegram just broke 500 million users. IF conservatives can't win a rigged Election they can win through power of the purse and choosing platforms who believe in free speech
Sold
Even insiders like Vijaya Gadde are selling their shares! im definitely shorting this stock!
twitter double standard on display in india.
Did anyone actually read the company earnings presser where a Q1 loss was forecast?That has been buried.

"Closing at 45-46, AH 40 bucks..."
Twitter going down because it's financially unable to make money. and that's good because they are enemy of people and censor tool. besides Jihadi Jack is addicted to different heavy drugs and can't think at all.
Never catch a falling knife.
"Tomorrow is the beginning of the end for the stock market, economy, and our country, Democrats will destroy it all, it won't happen in 1 day, 1 week, or even 1 year but will slowly do so over time, and the ones that will suffer the most are the young people who will be burdened with the enormous trillions of dollars of debt and a hopeless future for our country with the Democrat rule and their policies! Was just watching the video of Summer Breeze by Seals and Crofts on Youtube from 1972, takes me back to simpler times of the 70's when the world was a much nicer place to live in and life was less complicated and so much better, so glad I lived through those times, these poor young people of today...they'll never know!"
"You want to see an insurgency, come try to take away my free speech and guns. At 70 years old I would rather die then see my children and grandchildren lose these rights. I will fight with my last breath to defend these rights."
I didn't need to delete my Twit account since I never had one.
"Even a USPS truck driver announced he transferred 288,000 fraudulent ballots from New York State to Pennsylvania during the election."
Why no report on how many users Twitter lost? Must be pretty bad!
I hope it craters. Free speech is critical to the continuation of our Republic. We need FREE SPEECH - we don't need TWEETERS
This stock will get blackballed by the investor community.
"The stock just went straight through its 50 days moving average. Next resistance is 39. Go short all the way, this is easy money."
Nobody needs Twatter
Call your brokers first thing tomorrow morning to sell these toxic companies in your 401K and retirement portfolios!!
Shorting Twitter is my new stimulus package!
250 dollar a share. what a joke...facebook making a boat load of money off there ads... the bigger they are the harder they fall. sell...
I sold all shares of TWTR because its speech control makes me feel that I'm living under a Communist country.
The market lull is right around the corner. Watch it fall.
Godspeed Rush Limbaugh. Great men's love and ideas live on after them. RIP.
"Can someone explain why anyone should own Twitter stock not trade but own. With a 45 BILLION dollar market Cap, 2% inside ownership (who sell every time they convert their cheap options), loosing money hand over fist, loosing users even faster. The only way Vanguard, Morgan, and Block Rock can get out is on a sale and I assure you no one is paying these prices. I expect a rise in 4th quarter top line numbers with increased losses based on higher over head and a huge legal bill. I also expect first quarter will be dismal at best and their cash position to be dwindling. I think eventually this trade back to the 52 week lows of $20 per share. If I'm wrong so be it but I would like to here a bullish reason to own TWTR."
SELL SELL SELL
Buy more Twitter shares? Yes!! Only to SHORT!!!!
"There is no bottom to this stock. Everything they have done, is basically against our Constitution. Time for those who believe in this to financially support it. As far as me and my house, we deleted Facebook and Twitter. NEVER again will we allow censorship at that level. I hope they go bankrupt."
"It does not matter your political affiliate, freedoms must stand! Sell sell sell"
Censorship like in communist China?????
We haven't heard from Debra today. I like to hear from Debra and then watch the stock collapse.

"Hey Twitter investors, Dorsey doesn’t care about you, he’s made his money! Better sell quick before it’s too late!"
this is only the first wave of selling buyers jumping in today will be sorry
Beautiful numbers. Pricing power is your friend
Per O'Keefe more on Dorsey to follow. The 1st release was showing Dorsey telling his inner circle the game plan to take 1/2 of the population down. By Monday there will be so much more. O'Keefe is trying to get the leakers to interview (with voice altered and pic blacked out). It takes a brave sole to do that.
"the short is in,,,, how low can you go,,, I'm hoping for 15 bucks..............................."
"Monday is going to be fun, let’s send this to the pink sheets where it belongs."
"Lock THEM Up! One of six men federally charged on suspicion of being involved in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov.

I’m smelling red
To the world who looks for Retribution against communism! SELL TWITTER!!
TWTR is doing whatever they want (censorship of AMERICANS) thinking there is nothing we Americans can do. SURPRISE I sold my shares and shorting TWTR. This is what Americans can do to stop this attack on American rights!!!!!!
"Dorsey's company, Square was also down big today"

Where's Beijing Bidens covid plan? Another 4000 dead under Joe Bidens America.

Kamala Harris wouldn’t even be able to keep this UP today!
Oppenheimer must smoke something. TWTR lost 60-70 mil users .
Monday may be the largest bear raid in history. I bet Tim Sykes' army is lined up to bring blood. Will be fun to watch.
"never used twitter; never used parler. I wouldn't mind seeing Twitter go under. I like those that are brash; not so for those that are smug. This CEO is smug, and needs knocked down a few pegs."
"I think this whole big tech mess has actually been a good thing. I have gone to small businesses and pro freedom of speech companies to buy my goods and services now. When using Amazon you are paying Jeff Bozo when you could be buying directly from the seller and saving money and supporting small businesses directly. I am enjoying finding new online sites and small shops in my area. I have found EVERYTHING online that I had with Amazon. When I deleted my Amazon account there was a subscription box that I gave up, but I found it online direct from the company. I guess I just assumed you had to go through Amazon to get a lot of the things I had bought off of Amazon. I am having a grand time finding new places to get my goods so this has actually been a good thing. The only thing I am still missing is Parler. I hope they come back! There isn't another social media site online like them that I can find yet. I liked the whole design of their site and all the many people I met on there. I have Gab and ChatDit and Rumble and I don't miss Youtube. I am SORRY though for all the creators on there that are losing money by people deleting their accounts or not watching YouTube. I hope all my favorite creators move to Rumble or the other free speech video sites and I can find them soon."
Down 16%. Not enough. More lunacy coming from the CEO.
I'm do not support the Viking invasion of the Capitol...but taking away freedom of speech is WRONG! Short this to Zero...
Ask yourself after twitter becomes all democrats who are they going to argue with. Most people would get on there to argue. The amount of time spent on twitter will go down for even democrats.
Dorsey will be jailed very soon. Leaked video from Satan himself detailing his true intent for the platform. Government not happy!
"Twitter, the literal 'falling knife'..."
"Anyone still holding this stock or using the app stands for Communism. It’s all fun and games when it’s happening to your political adversary but when it happens to you, you’ll be crying in the street. No one will have sympathy for you then. Go back and research the Tweet from Pelosi on May 16, 2017 crying about the election being stolen. Sound familiar. It was perfectly fine when she and the Dems did it. Then go look up the Nov 13,2018 tweet where she Welcomed the “activists” and strongly urged Capitol Police to allow them to protest. See you call them activists of them supporting Dem cause and rioters and insurrectionists if they’re against the Dem cause. Hypocrisy knows no bounds as a Democrat."
"Support Democracy!!! By a 'My Pillow' from the outgoing Emperor's pal. Hey, maybe Rudy could sue on his behalf? Bigly?"
"Just reported, Dorsey is selling off! Sell now! Not a joke!"
SHORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How many other countries want to block twitter after the past year!
"Sinking ship, so obvious, short ASAP, when the institution still remains the price for a short period of time when they want to escape!"
"I deactivated my TWTR accounts, both of them ."
This Companies is violating your Freedom of Speech ! and they talk about China..?
You have freedom of speech. You just don't have freedom to tweet.
7 days in a row
Just deactivated my account.
I can't support it no longer
Nice moves this week $ENPH $QS $CHWY $PYPL $DDD $TWTR were a few of my best performers. $GBTC is Rock'n'Roll!! Looking for a big move north for $PLTR when it reports before the bell Tueday. Not priced for perfection. A weak pocket to be taken advantage. $RKT perhaps the best value in the entire market. Enjoy the weekend. Buy $PLTR after hours. Premarket on Tuesday may be a little late.
"Hey guys, can I interest you in a company which cannot make any money, and any profits it did make in 2020 they handed away to BLM? I also have some great beach front property in Arizona..."
this communist wagon is climbing to between 65 and 67. The best thing you can do is buy and hold
just the fact that most negative posts are more political and less about the business is quite intriguing.
"Once the stock market bubble bursts, this will be in the pennies. Next quarter's financial report would be awful as tens of millions have left this anti-speech and anti-American company."
Twitter Loses 5 BILLION In ONE DAY!! Major Backlash As Tech Companies Go TOO FAR!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSAXzukTWb8&fbclid=IwAR1Bex9KDLGIL5qDvnoNJFO9IFYWV9sV5j226eRY8zg-1IPLxSnDA619FU4
im selling all my shares!! this stock is going tank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sold all my holdings and will never use this company again.
"Twitter reported a loss of $7.44 Million in March, but at the same time handed $10 Million to BLM. Can anyone explain that? How can you allow these reckless people to handle your money. You got no dividend, Twitter reported a loss, but BLM got handed $10 Million."
If this is going up bc investors think Twitter will make more money by charging are NOT on Twitter reading the responses to this idea. Hint: It's going over like a lead balloon.
"Jack Goebbels Dorsey is learning that the more he censors, the more the Wall St. cheerleaders will pump his stock."
Over the last 4 years we've seen people beaten in airports and on streets and ejected from restaurants just because they were wearing a hat someone didn't like. Attending a political rally was to walk through a throng of shrieking belligerents. To ask unpopular questions (or express an opinion) about how votes are counted and processed and how a count can run negative is to be called a liar and deranged. Where is Twitter and Facebook during all of this? Busy helping America decay.
Twitter finally paying off
"TWTR just suspended the account of a Republican congresswoman for expressing her opinion. TWTR claims her comments violated ""civic integrity"". TWTR is now actively banning speech by an array of conservative voices. Look for another selloff in the stock this week."
Who’s responsible for the violence happening in South America with the caravan headed this way? Who told them to come?
Twitter is in the censorship game now.
Hope you sold when you had a chance. This thing will be negative by days end.
Single digits
I don't want to live in a world where Big News and Big Tech dictate my values and action.
"To all those socialist liberals out there....if you support TWTR cescorship now, wait until they come after you later. TWTR $0"
im in the socialist bread line known as Sam's Club....stretched all the way around the parking lot
Down 17% and up 2% . Still short and strong!
"That boycott is just killing this stock as effectively as it did Nike. Oh, the horror and the damage caused by the ire of the Turnip-worshipers. Is Parler back on line so this board can be thoroughly fumigated? Bigly?"
"And the aggression of North Korea begins. Iran, Russia and China to follow. Good luck with that, dems."
The decision may backfire on Twitter if half the country decides not to use its platform.
The Kamal Harris Double Standard Test.. She needs to be impeached for supporting a bail fund to bail out criminals who burned down and looted and defaced private property across several cities..
Lots of supporters of Twatters here like Chuck who likes chock. I bet they are all flaming like their beloved closeted Jackie Dorset.
No one likes Dorsey. Not Wall Street and not even his mother.
Market Cap will be cut in half over next 6-12 months. Poor decisions have major consequences
"Social media has its place, and that is for the PEOPLE to come together for a common purpose. In this case to show we the PEOPLE wont be told what we can and cannot say/believe. If we use social media in this way for all kinda of issues I think we can make a difference in all sectors of life. WE have the power to change our world and hope we can all come together to do so."
How do you offend a conservative? tell him a lieHow do you offend a liberal? tell them the truth.
I heard that the SEC has subpoened some documents from Jack. Using Amazon to shut down competition was NOT a smart move.
This stock is way overpriced. It's negative earnings speak volumes.
no earnings just magic beans
Just realized Ive lost more twitter follwers than Sleepy Joe has supporters.
Any company that treats its users and shareholders like this should be sold!
Beast mode. Too much pricing power. U can't stop it.
Happy Martin Luther king day
"For anyone who doesn't think trump is important to twitter. Look at the stock chart and compare it to when he took office in 2017. In 2016 is when he was campaigning seriously. Now having looked at the chart, #$%$ do you think is going to happen now that Trump is banned? Trump is most likely going to move to an alternate platform and there is going to be mass exodus from the site. Get out before you lose your money!"
why is this stock going up?
A breakout I’ve (we’ve) been waiting 3-4 years for. Sit back and watch!
Impeach the president. Now
"Could be wrong, but I think TWTR is headed to high 30's before the week is over."
Just sold my shares of Twitter and Facebook and cancelled my accounts too.
Single digits coming soon
Next week we go to the 30s
"I was suspended for life years ago because of a negative Hillary comment but they wont allow me to deactivate my account ""because I'm suspended"". In short, Jack can count my account when selling ads, even though I can't use it."
"wow sleepy Joe crying during the meeting today. He knows he can't do anything and lipstick AOC is running the show. He is also crying he has no idea to do with 8,000 people about to storm border."
How does it feel in your pocket Twitter Take the American  people freedom away ??next week keep shorting this / sell and deactivate your accounts You can take away our voice but you can’t take away our Freedom
11 days straight up. Time to cool down. Take the profit and trade in after a week 
Social media profits are now more distributed. It was just FB ruling the roost couple couple of years back. Go Twitter!!
Look for the Sherman Act to be used against big tech. The leadership should also be sued when shares tank.
"They take away Parler, we storm the Yahoo message boards with politics. LOL. What else you got for us FANG (minus Netflix and what do you get?)"
Top Conservative Leader Tom Fitton Is Still Suspended by Twitter 7 Days After a 7 Day Suspension for Tweeting the Truth on HCQ
Indian Government planning to Ban Twitter and encouraging KOO. Its new Indian app.
It’s hilarious how the big players are trying to pump this back up. It’s gonna fall hard earnings
"Put an end to censorship, regardless as to how you identify. Plenty of other places to make money!"
More competition coming! Young upstarts will disrupt the space!
I have a busy day at work today... but this sure is fun to watch
Ouch! Down again ...............................
Some companies you just enjoy seeing fail. And this is one of them. Facebook will be another. No tech company is bigger than America itself.
"Down, down, down and the flames went higher!"
What I like most about this SHORT most is there isn’t a single FREE THINKER Bag holder here! 
This is going to be the best short. This stock will go to zero as soon as someone comes out with another app
"It's Wednesday, January 13, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his brownshirt twatteratti be censoring today?"
"Twitter has chosen to slice away a huge chunk of their customer base.But unlike currently out of favor pandemic distressed companies, TWTR will never see favor again. They've chopped off an appendage that won't grow back.Maybe this is what they want. Maybe they want to be a small player. A small player with a 100% like-minded clientele in a zero controversy echo chamber.I don't know, but for a publicly traded company, that is arguably criminal.Not sure what tomorrow brings for TWTR, but the future is dismal."
It’s all over for twitter!
"Dorsey is probably buying umbrellas, hot pockets, shields, hammers and back packs for his Antifa comrades."
"twitter just not cool anymore. It was a good fad, but it's history.People cancelling by the millions."
Great Day Shorts. They tried to prop it up but failed. Gonna have to take a look at the calls they sold. Reckoning Coming Feb 9th
"hope twitter burns to the ground! I sold my stock!!! 25 grand may not be much alone, but hope its multiples with anyone who likes free speach!"
"Deactivated twitter, FB and deleted cash app "
"So what's your premarket predictions. I think this will be down $5 in the premarket, and open at $43. From there it will drop further..."
Hope I can get a sell order in for over $51 tomorrow
"Greg Abbott has already DEMANDED the return of the Texas national guard. It was an abuse of power to use them, and now that dementia Joe has used them, they are sleeping out in the cold."
"Who will start the class action lawsuit against Jack & Twtr for putting political preference before company value? Looks like his decision has cost share holders about 10 Billion of value in 1 week, with worse to come. Worst part is that now antitrust lawsuits and section 230 immunity will be going away, opening the door to thousands of law suits. I think I am out!"
How are the twatters feeling today?
"“Do not dare to use our previous morals against us, but feel free to pay off our financial transgressions.”- Republicans to DemocratsMAGA - Making Accountability “Go Away”"
Short Twitter and defund a liberal
Conservative has to build their own servers! Google can take you down also if they don’t feel good today! 
"TWTR is past its prime. No matter what price targets the insiders put on it. With 0 earnings and 0 dividends, censorship of half its users, and upcoming govt regulations worldwide, eventually it is going down. Social media doesn't stay the same forever. A new popular platform shows up and it is done. Enjoy while it lasts. I expect it to eventually reach its 2016 lows. Yes, there will be rallies and sell offs on the way. It won't go down in a straight line."
Timber! How low will Twitter stock go? 19?
"The Dems have turned the US into a BANANA REPUBLIC. Even Angela Merkel, not exactly an ally of Trumps, is criticizing Big Tech in the US for having too much power. While the Dems applaud the abuse of power by Big Tech to silence their political foes the world is condemning it! $AAPL $FB $MSFT $GOOGL $AMZN"

Puts are cheap—get them while you can!
Dorsey on the Veritas recording with the face of the Marxist saying it's time to take the opposition down....and guess what? The vote is with him as the stock opened up. Guess there are more people who hate the Constitution and We the People than I thought.
I’m from Texas. All my friends will stop using Twitter. It actually isn’t a big deal. Most don’t use it much anyway.
SNAP > TWTR?
Even Uganda realizes Twitter is done.

"libs on wall street will try to prop this up in the short term. but, long term they can't stop the drop. having no dissenting views will only make things worse, not better."
Google and Apple trying to remove access to Parler to stifle the competition. Better get it now before the censors take it away. Time to move away from Apple and Twitter too. Also time to exist that the politicians remove Google's protected monopoly.
Bet Twitter don't tweet about todays losses. BUT I will. lol
Twitter is a prime example of why we can’t have good things. Someone always comes along and mess it up.
"Sell TWTR, executuve team are breaking the First Amendment right to the constitution of the United States. Anti-American company, get the hell out of this stock before it goes to zero and all money lost! Patriots will use other platforms. Lose money big time, going down fast! Sell, Sell, Sell...."
how do i short this?
It'll close red.
All the big holders are in meetings now getting approval to sell. This is is going to create such a crazy chain reaction sell off.

"Sell this stock, save freedom"
"So you want me to buy shares in a company which cannot make a profit, pays no dividends, and hands $10 Million away to BLM while declaring a loss at Quarterly Earnings?"
"Twitter also controlled tweets directed at liberal politicians. Your tweet will appear but no one can see it , this is how bad their censorship has gotten."
A whistleblower inside Twitter recorded CEO Jack Dorsey and sent Project Veritas the recording.
"pressure is too big imho, how many people will close their account in coming weeks?"
"Only criminal politicians put walls and fences around the buildings, that supposedly belong to the people, so they can rush the process of tearing a country and its people down."
Deactivated!
Shame on the shortsightedness of any American holding or buying this stock at any price.

I will sell today. Don't like holding a stock that's going up into earnings but I have to give thanks to the ReTrumplicans for giving me a nice trade at $44.05 to here buying 600 shares. Thanks guys!!
One of the few times that it's ethical to short a company
Boycott Twitter advertisers! I canceled my account but tell me who they are and my business will go elsewhere.
This one became political which is the worst kind of problem to have. Most who sold are not coming back because they left for another reason.
Sad day in America when the leader of Germany (Merkel) is lecturing us about free speech. These leftist Democrats are dangerous! Why are liberals silent?
"look at options today, oh boy"
Hey guys we have to show these guys that you can not go against the wil of the people. Close your accounts and put them out of business.
"Out of 718 businesses in downtown Portland, only 430 are (sorta) still open--most by appointment. 200 nights of riots in Portland. People beat and shot. Same with Seattle. California, police shot while just patrolling. Where where all these companies like Twitter and Facebook during all of this? In fact, they let calls for violence against Pence to trend after they kicked off a bunch of people."
"I don't know how it is green either, everyone I know including myself have cancelled our accounts."
FB and TWTR are being banned from Internet Provider..... hahaha
"I wonder how all those ""special people who are loved"" felt who, when facing Federal charges, found out that they weren't on the Pardon List? I just love that Garret Miller story. Check it out. It's hilarious.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Make America Graduate Already"

Mayday mayday! Twitter will crash soon! Sell! This is not a joke!
Twitter = Censorship
Twitter is now Glimmer of what it used to be....GLIMMER new name
problem is say a large company looking to go to the cloud now realize they will be held to the standard of the Twitter ceo.. this will kick facebook and twitter to the curb as well as amazon. I would in no way move an app to AWS under current conditions NO WAY!! and i just sold my stocks related to these socilaist companies as i want no part of communist movement here in the usa
Ya the only reason I had Twitter was to see what POTUS says next !
"Who's buying this garbage? Twitter has become nothing more than a political campaign. This is not a company that any rational investor would want exposure to, where world leaders are coming out against it. Now you have state wide internet providers blocking bandwidth to Twitter and Facebook making it inaccessible to their users. We are are in the midst of technological warfare."
Close your accounts people. Show these btards they can't run our lives.

How about that 20% decline in the stock price?Gotta love it!!!The shareholders should be miffed. He has personally destroyed billions in stockholder equity.Should be voted out.
The TWTR chart looks like the BTC chart.
They are fleeing in big numbers. Sellers can't offload it fast enough.
"This wont show up in the next earnings report numbers, but the call might be interesting.""so.....hows this quarter looking?"""
"I would like to thank all retrumplicans for giving me a nice entry at $44.05. I couldn't have made a nice profit without ya! Btw, keep covering!"
Rise up!!
Once a shareholder . Never again . No freedom of speech ? This is not China . They Took away Trumps account.
Stalin now endorses Twitter
"Twitter, Amazon, and Apple will probably work with Joey and Nancy on Article 2 now to target you gun owners. That will be chaos."
"It's Friday, January 15, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
Somebody worked hard to pump it before the EOD sell off. Last 10 min almost here!
Jack has to go. Democrats don't control free speech.
Red in an hour watch this space...
Liz Cheny/Adam Kinzinger 2024!Impeach Margery Taylor Green!
"Q1 Earning APRIL 29. Co. presser promised to be NEGATIVE. I believe them, do you?"
bet twtr is dying. they DON'T know how important of Trump for their company!
Will be $20 by end of year if they keep censoring half the country.
Are Americans capable of handling freedom and free speech or do we need the government to manage it for us.
Laugh if you want but I have predict big shorting before. This turkey is going down.
I deactivated my twitter account and so should you.It's not about whether you like the POTUS or not! If you don't realize that you should!
"Twitter shares tumbling down again tomorrow, , look out below..."
climate change is real....it will be hot in the summer and cold in the winter.....hot changing to cold....its reall folks.....
More Pump and Dump eh? Project Veritas spilled the beans on what Dorsey is up to. The bottom will fall out of this today.
This is being pumped. Just wait to see when they report the number of accounts they have lost
"DC is under martial law. So much for the land of the free. If we ever want to be free again, we may have to assert that right..."
Run before it bankrupt
Democrats wasting taxpayer dollars. Again.
Twitter wins again and 45 and Q lose once again by a landslide.
America land of the caged by tech? Short short short
Lol can you please everyone sell out this authoritarian tech giant?? Seriously they are perfect for China and Russia maybe but not for USA and Europe..
Someones is going to Buy-Out or Takeover Twiter
"Killed my Twitter account. Hope the company hemorrhages both users and money. Luckily, there’s still plenty of room on the streets of San Francisco for CEO Dorsey once he’s homeless."
Checkout Walmart's brand new answer to Amazon Prime. Hit this free speech hater were it really hurts- in their wallet.
"For those who sold in January due to their political convictions good for you. for those who stayed, have d added thousands/millions of dollars to their brokerage accounts. you the man Dorsey"
Why would anyone buy the stock of a company that is run by someone trying to take American rights away ?
The deep state is full of shallow thinkers and they own TWTR. Sweet dreams.
Dead money.
Sorry birdy but I am not holding bags this time any more.
Isn’t Twitter violating the Constitution that our families fought for? Maybe I’m right.
Instead of joining social media I joined the NRA and does it feel good
Shorttt ittt. Twitter is in a downward spiral. They’re done
CEO getting sued for giving SQ data on TWTR users. SQ made millions. Did shareholders vote to approve when he gave BLM $10 Million? How much did he give to shareholders? BOD just looks the other way? Not investing my money. He needs to choose SQ or TWTR.
There will be a rise of a conservative social media. And it won't be Jack at the top.
"stock price does not follow politics. the real fact is they canceled a individual who has allot of followers, investors and advertisers. a very large group of advertisers, followers and users are leaving. that and that alone is the cause of the drop price."
"Many States have invested in Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. Call your Governor and ask what their plans are?"
Just wait until employees with stock options start quitting
Maybe I will sue Dorset to recover the ads I paid before on Twatter. I couldn't not believe I gave money to this muffin liberal then he gave away 10 million dollars to the BLM.
"the problem with social media is they only show you what you agree with,thus creating your own little world where everone agrees with you.There's nothing social about that."
"It's Tuesday, January 12. Who are Jack Dorsey and his Twatteratti censoring today? Oh, look, QAnon is the newest recipient of the brownshirt treatment."
"Facebook does not own Myspace, rather it is privately owned by two brothers.Conservatives should cancel Facebook, and join Myspace."
NEW: Twitter has suspended GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for 12 hours.45’s Fanboys: “Who cares...we worship only one man and we were going to short Twitter anyway.” 
Wow! Lots Of Talk On Here About Bring Our Beautiful Blue Bird Down! I Said I Would Sell All My Long Shares Of TWTR The Moment I Stopped Hearing Twitter a Hundred Times a Day! Still Hearing It (Actually Been Hearing It Even More)! So I'm Not Selling And I Will Be Trading In And Out Next Week Like a Boxer Jumping a Rope! So You Shorts Don't Let This TWTR Gal Down! Give Me Some Volatility Baby;)

"Evolution is a funny thing ! Apple ? Facebook , amazon Twitter. Just like the car replaced the horse and buggy these companies eventually will be replaced with something newer , fresh and better .We might see the birth of a conservative Silicone valley"
its setting up perfectly for a lunchtime selloff to 43.

$TWTR will be going to the social media reunions with MySpace in a few months.
Jack telling the investors everything will be fine....
So revs down 30% in Q1Shares at 13x salesGood luck with that
Remember: This ia a company that still keeps the Ayatollah of Iran chanting “Death to America”! (Think about that)...
"Domino effect: Millions of conservatives gone from Twitter and pulled out their advertisements. Millions less crazed green haired lefties engaging conservatives, not to mention countries and states enforcing strict rules against social media companies. Ask yourself: why would you invest and risk your hard earned money in such companies??...Get out! $FB"
A Twitter short is free money. Good for the soul too.
Google next to fall for banning so many conservatives off their platform and off of Youtube. They seem not to realise that most people who are investors are more more likely to be Republicans.
Dorsey for Treason. Twitter going to ZERO
Short
Can you imagine Twitter with just Liberals and democrats? It would be similar to a modern day Clan meeting...
Shorts are crying
"Twitee needs gazoline to fly higher to the $ 150 plus elevation ( bonds needed) , Let us take a ride with Twitee to the $150 plus elevation Cramer said buy the dip"
cancel Twitter! this co is DONE. pull your money out its a bad investment!
Sell sell sell sell sell
"What a disgrace, that if we want to know the truth we have to look at another nation's newspapers. Look at the Sun newspaper from the UK about John Sullivan the BLM activist. You'll get the picture when you see him in a paramilitary uniform with firearms. He's WALKING FREE already. Think about it."
Trump supporters delete your Twitter account Don?t worry this #$%$ company will tank Monday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Twitter Bans Over 70,000 QAnon Accounts in Conspiracy Crackdownyou the man Dorsey"
All social media. Cancel it. Biggest waste of time on the planet. Join the human race again.
Puts puts puts
Censorship has no place in America! Say goodbye to Twitter
"I have been holding TWTR since 2015. Whew, patience finally pays off. Compared to SNAP, TWTR is only a bit more than 50% of SNAP market cap. I am sure Twitter has lots of room to go from here if the comparison with Snapchat is justified: Twitter has 330m subscribers, vs Snap 250m. Additionally, TWTR has tangible earnings, vs Snapchat is still losing money.Go TWTR"
"So Jack, can you explain to me why my 13 year old son gets DM's on Twitter from middle-aged men asking him to do things, and from others showing naked pictures of women? It says clearly on his account that he is a young teenager and only interested in gaming."
"Twatter still at it. Suppressed the news how elected officials forced 26,000 national guards to rest inside a packed parking garage with 1 restroom during a pandemic! #$%$ is Twitter allowed to do business in the USA?!!!"
We got $45.45 lmfao
"Every person who believes free speech should ban appple, Amazon, google, FB and Twitter and stop buying or using these apps or products until they apologize for their actions ."
Sell Twitter. The trend has begun
You think this run is sustainable?? Only by manipulation.
Jack Dorsey intentionally and willfully torpedoed his own company. But it’s not his to do that with anymore. It belongs to millions of people owning those 751 million shares.
Joe you don't eliminate energy jobs and say get green jobs that don't exist yet. Where is your common sense?
"Twitter's largest advertiser is Nestle. Just sent them the following message: ""If you choose to continue advertising on Twitter, the brazen enemy of free speech, I will choose to purchase products solely from your cpmpetitors."""
it may be green right now but that trend line ain't looking to good for the day...or the week.
"I had a Twitter account way back at the start, but never used it. I wonder if I can still access it because I want to delete it on principal. Once I save some stuff off FB that will be history too."
You buying this will help bring about your end.
Twitter... the new Luckin Coffee.
Thank you Twitter for locking law and order account.
Dorsey very soon.
"America, now has 3 New Forms of Government: Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook !!!"
Declass and a wiki dump coming. Big Tech will be unrecognizable in 6 months
shareholders are going to have a rock-solid case when the class action lawsuit hits Twitter. I'm pretty sure there was no disclosure that they were getting ready to become a political lobbying organization on behalf of the Democratic Party. not to mention the idea that they are working with the other Faang stocks to become a communist anti-free speech platform
"I am calling for all shareholders to dump Twitter and never buy again. I am done with Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple by the way I dumped their stock this morning (LONG time holder.) Just sick of the liberal pandering!"
My Twitter account was locked yesterday for no apparent reason. Imagine if Walmart started blocking hundreds of thousands of customers. How is that in the best interest of shareholders?
conservative minded SEC attorneys are thoroughly scouring $TWTR financial statements to see if there were any disclosures made warning investors that Twitter is a left leaning political organization..despite what they say they are in business with Democrats..politically biased to the point of purposely alienating 1/2 their customer base..if these risk were not disclosed..they will be open to shareholder class action lawsuits
Lmao This nation is about to get lit up. Patriots about to siege every US capital. Let's get it.
"For anybody that’s interested, I heard that the trumped store is having a BOGO sale. All payments are to be sent directly to Mar-a-Lago. Ironically, all purchases will be delivered via USPS."
Use of Parler is blocked by big tech. You must convert to big techs beliefs or be a marginalized citizen.
"It is so nice to have real news without the lies and misinformation, and also real daily briefings from ourexecutive leadership, and also leadership that is about helping people instead of corporations."
Cancel the current CEO -- NOT America's freedom of speech.
The sooner the world walks away from Twitter and FB the better off it will be
"Deleted my Twitter account today, in solidarity with 1,000 of my followers who Twitter deleted. Good riddance Twitter. I won't be watching any more of your advertisements. You lose."
"I recommend selling this stock short. Since they do not believe in freedom of speech for conservatives,they are doomed to go out of business."
At what price will the Board of Directors and investors ask Jack to step down as CEO/Chairman?
"Trumpsters invest in old tech, fosil fuel and cigarette stocks....anti science losing big market....rest of us make mint"
Jacko getting what he deserves...
"I?m going to get directly to the point. Jack Dorsey does not giving a flying bats #$%$ about you shorting or selling TWTR shares.- Yes, Twitter will go down and possibly loose ground in the long run. Especially in terms of new subscriptions and organic growth- Jack Dorsey has Square (SQ), trading on the NYSE at $241.45 a share. It is a payment processing platform, unless every small business and its shareholders bails out of that ship, Twitter will just be a small kink. He may step down, focus on Square and just be on the board of Twitter.- All the Democrats with deep pockets and his fellow Tech friends will prop this to the moon. Their resolve will be far stronger just because of the deep pockets and connections they have. If one falls, they all fall. They won?t let that happen."
Twitter’s future is not looking too bright. The creepy CEO has moved onto other business ventures—Investors should too.
Elon Musk is promoting Signal? new platform?
Suckers rally Shorting the heck out of this No one interesting tweets anymore
I will cover my twtr short under 17$
Kamal was egging on the protester.. The double standard is going to put targets on a lot of people..
Twitter is continuing in a downward spiral as the charts show it breaking down on the charts with currently no bottom in site until you get to 39.43 which would represent the 200 day moving average. If it continues downward from there it would be ugly to say the least and would like fall to 29.43 area.
"Twitter will only be remembered ""as that one social media company"" who censored thepresident of the United states and got clapped. Students will study the error of Jacks ways one day in their business classes"
You can bet Dorsey and his mates are offloading their shares right now. Which he got for free incidentally.
"William Gates doesn’t get a pass. Flying around with his billionaire toys doesn’t make him exempt from the climate crisis. Gates claims he’s a good billionaire, who wants to offset his climate damage. He does it by making more money investing in companies that promise to remove his carbon. This cyclical BS doesn’t work. Gates can drive or walk, has money enough to be Virtual anywhere, and with a pandemic raging, doesn’t NEED to be anywhere. Take a break, Gates, and stop messing it up for the rest of us."
Who is staring down the TWTR shorts today?
bull trap. 12 million already left twitter
keep the pressure on. they can't prop it up forever. It will collapse.
"Since Facebook and Twitter want to cut off any other competition to their monopoly and censorship of media, I say dump them both and just call and talk to someone on your phone. Yea, it's old fashion but you actually get to hear the other person and they get to hear your voice. This censorship thing has gone too far. Last I looked this was still America. At this rate we won't have to worry about China or Russia for interference for meddling in our lives!"
"Well folks, are you letting social media control you? I am done... boycotted all- FB, Twitter, Hollywood, Wall St Journal, TV news, etc!"
if it gets bellow 1 dollar it will get delisted
TWTR is going down to $20! Run Away Quickly!
Twitter is DONE! Sell everything before it’s too late!
"Not to be outdone by his counterpart in Albany, the illegit twit, dementia patient in the WH is embarking on his own campaign to see how many people he can marginalize by removing them from this earth. Thanks to the reckless immigration policies of this sham administration 15 people, albeit illegals, were transformed into placemats when the vehicle they were stacked in, like cord wood, collided with a semi along the border with Mexico. The logical response from this abomination of an administration would be to provide busses with a police escort, at the taxpayers expense, to ensure they make it to the sanctuary city of their choosing where they can hide out until Boondoggle Bydoon can wave his magic wand and pronounce them ""legal citizens"".BTW. Twitter stock is junk. Short this  to $20."
"""The biggest threst to national security is U.S. cops"" recent Buden appointee Jaline Porter to be deputy spokesperson for the United States State Department. Winning."
"a good point to ponder ---->""Why hasn’t Jack Dorsey been arrested for lying under oath about Twitter’s censorship policies?"" YET?"
"actually we don't have to blame jihadi Jack or other big tech companies. those are communist lefties working for democRATs to create a totalitarian dictatorship. they do their duties. all the blame goes to Republicans that didn't see this rising monopoly, goes to Bush family, to Romney, to McCane, to any Republican after great president Reagan. you started an alternative social media platform in 2020 and want to catch the gap when all the power is on the devil side? good luck"
Twatter will be a distant memory by the end of this year.
"You were not fast enough, my question got taken down real fast this time.""If you don't fire the prosecutor you don't get the Billion Dollars"" what did he mean?? Real question that has never been answered"
"I didn't even know what Parler was until a couple days ago, and shock to see the monopolistic big Tech TWTR, APPLE, AMAZON banded together to bully and shut down a small company. This is outrageous!"
"Twitter – Trying to re-find relevance before it is too lateIt is important to note the major demographic headwinds Twitter is facing. Youth and Millennials are not flocking to Twitter (pardon for the pun) except in rare cases to view announcements from their favorite pastimes (sports, music, entertainment, finance, politics). They very much prefer Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (plus many one-off versions thereof). Twitter exists for them, but only in passing. They are the future of communication and social media. Jack & Company would prize this demographic if it could break into it better.To the youth of today, Twitter (which has been around FOREVER in their minds) is the Yahoo! of yesteryear. I know of what I speak, my millennial son (& daughter) refuse to check Twitter even for information about his own college sports team (he is on)! They are addicted to the other venues; he and my daughter have no interest in what Lady Gaga had for lunch or how good or bad whatever administration in office is.On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Boomers who comprise ~30% of the US population. They live, breath and die Facebook (connect to family, friends). Remember the commercial where the lady used Post-it notes for her posts on the dry erase board? That captured many a boomer’s attention. Within the past year some created secondary ‘social media’ Twitter accounts to discuss politics. As-of late, few have stayed, but many have fled back to the friendly confines of Facebook.In the middle is where Jack & Co. exist, the Gen-X, Gen-Z and other folk between 32 and 55. They want to know stuff and they want to know now. They do have very solid buying power and are attractive to advertisers. With the new business model they are working on, he and the executive team are trying to upsell this demographic the best they can. Announcing paid content, paid accounts to follow, and anything that could generate revenue off the main focus group.It is unfortunate, and not likely, the other ends of the social media demographic pie will ever migrate; Twitter management knows this only too well. As the millennials age, they will take up more and more room on the social media spectrum and unfortunately, Yahoo! (sorry, I meant Twitter) is not going to be in their wheelhouse.Many of that middle group are now exiting for different discussion venues, and that is important loss Jack & Co. have to overcome. Twitter is a STATUS application. In the ‘biz’ we call it ‘push communications’. You can ‘push’ out content and status, but as for the true ‘social’ backbone, it is very narrow; Twitter was never engineered to be a BLOG. Remember, they even reported user interactions down in Q4 and we have yet to even see a taste of Q1.Telegram is a MAJOR apple cart disrupter for Twitter. They are engineered to be a major ‘push’ engine. Channels are subscribed to and push information to users. There are discussions in Chat Channels, but nothing compared to the subscribed channels with folk waiting for information.Why do I bring up Telegram? In a short amount of time they have almost doubled the number of users Twitter has. They are growing quickly. There is ALWAYS a new kid on the block trying to win the social media beat down game.Parler you say? Niche only. Folk disgruntled ONLY about a political outcome seem to be over there. Between it and GAB and CloutHub, they may have drained off 10% of the Twitter user attention.So where does this leave Jack & Co. They are completely redoing their business model to capture the ‘middle dollars’. Boomers, Millennials and youth won’t pay for them. Advertisements are nice but non-middle demographic folk already have one-click Amazon prime accounts and know what they want. They are getting harder and harder to influence.So where does that leave Twitter compared to the big dog, Facebook?Facebook earns $10.09 per share. It has a P/E of 25.98 given a price of $262. Facebook market cap is 745.83B. Financially speaking, they are under valued for a social media platform.Twitter earns -$1.44 per share and has no P/E. Twitter market cap is 61.91B. Twitter with a current price of $77 would have to earn $4 per share to support the same P/E (check my math). Yes, they just earned 39 cents in Q4 and projecting a loss Q1 of 2021. The hill is super steep.Maybe Jack & Co. can get to $4 share in EPS, maybe not. He has to put all the boots on the ground or Twitter really has no bright future given their narrow demographic constraints and social media ‘push’ platform.Be careful out there chasing stocks or cars!"
"The next three of earnings reports, will determine Twitters fate. IMO."
Short this stock and you’ll make a lot money! They are toast!
The swamp is still draining.
Fly Birdie Fly! Tweet Tweet Baby;)
People like Chuck are very representative of the caliber of people remaining on Twitter.
"Why did TWTR do what it did....look at their Board members and their countries of birth and dual citizenship.....China, Iran....."
Shorts exercise your free speech United we all stand . Freedom of speech
Twitter sinking like a rock . . . Evil doesn’t float!
"For a ""phony fake hoax"" virus that would soon be cleared up by ""herd mentality"" and responsive to hydroxychloroquine, COVFEFE-45 sure caused a lot of destruction not to mention those 400,000+ Americans that died just to influence the election and to make President Dennison ""look bad"".I'm surprised that before boarding the coal-fueled Air Force One golf cart for the last time that President Dennison had nothing to say about the dead cop from the Capital, the 400,000+ dead Americans that inconvenienced him or the massive Russian hack that infiltrated our infrastructure on his watch.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Making Accountability ""Go Away"""
Tweeter & Face-plant looking a little shaky today.
"MOST people on the right who are #$%$ off with Twitter haven't left yet as they don't want to be disconnected entire. Most people on the left will ALSO exit as they don't have Trump to hate on every day anymore. It's already boring and will only be more boring as Biden will suddenly have to actually LEAD instead of blaming every paper cut or stubbed toe on Trump. So once everything is resolved in DC the current exodus will like a slow drip compared to the tsunami who will drop twitter in 2-3 months. Not to mention those who ONCE KNEW letting everyone speak their mind, even when you vehemently disagree with them, IS an American value, they TOO will exit twitter for taking such a dictatorial heavy hand. And once they go, they will NEVER come back. Check out Fox News, NFL, NBA, if you do not believe losing your audience in THIS manner, is PERMANENT. Twitter will NEVER have MANY of these users ever again. There is also a coming Facebook exodus...it will be very strong as well. Feb-March timeframe enjoy the downward slides shorting these stocks."
5 dollar stock by the end of summer
The Leftys here think they can control the Narrative on a stock board never mind the numbers and the chart. this ain't uncle Jack's Twatter
"It's collapsing already, and premarket is just about to begin for most traders."
BIG TECH CRASH!!!$FB $AMZN
The hashtag “#AlexandriaOcasioSmollett” became a top trend on Twitter Wednesday as users connected the dots to find that the New York congresswoman wasn’t in the Capitol building during her “near-death experience.”
Just closed my Twitter account.
"LOL...the Dems want to cancel the middle class! And if they do, who do they think is going to pay the taxes?? Real bright people over there."
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise there of; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for the redress of grievances. Jack Dorsey made Twitter against the first amendment and made its own rule against free speech!"
No surprise it's big institutions that are keeping the share price up
The Twitter supporters here realize that through this shareholders lawsuit settlement Dorsey had to give up all rights of control over the company right? Worst company of 2021 easily.
Just 2% without any news. Hyped to go short.
Everybody get your popcorn and drinks and have a seat. The show is about to begin!!! Would love too see a 20% dive today.
"Buy, buy , buy $75 next"
Why would anybody buy a company that increase 2-10% over a year and no dividends but donate the shareholders dividends to leftist group. There are millions of companies that values increase 10-20% in a day.
I urge everyone to sell your shares hope this drops to 0
"it is time to ban jack dorsey and all twitter employees and staff as well as their defenders from any and all social networks. Also their bank accounts should be garnished. If you know a twtr employee, it's time to get up in their face and tell them they are now welcome (a quote from mad max waters), seek them out and destroy their lives."
Hey you guys need to borrow my phone to send a tweet or anything?
This stock is being propped up by J Dorsey and his lefty club. They are buying shares on the side to make it seem more successful. Expect a significant fall in Q1 of 2021!
"No Parler. No problem let’s use twtr, google Ann and apple conversation board on yahoo finance.. lmao yahoo is another biased outlet"
Literally the world is laughing at the USA
Blackballed by Wall Street
BLM activist John Sullivan at Capitol riot ARRESTED was egging on Ashley Babbitt. It's on video. You can't make this up.
"Well, for now at least, it looks like the best strategy earlier today was to sell far out of the money puts and covered calls. So much premium. So easy. Stock is up 2%+ now."
TrumpTV analysts say 300 million dollar venture coming.
"Politics and Finance and Dislike of Longs v Shorts Aside:Ask yourself, FY20 + Q4 earnings were out only 16 days ago including company calls, FY21 Q1 earnings (negative) estimate, etc.; now this presser today.

"Down with comments Twitter, stock is plunging hard"
“Can ya spare a buck or at least a share of Twitter?

I urge everyone to take a look at TWTR's chart. Set the range to 1 year daily. What do you think? It looks like a small pen1s is forming. LOL!!!
Dorsey is buying shares to prop up the share price. LOL
Mismanagement made this a failure.

Evolution is a funny thing just like the car replaced the horse and buggy Twitter will be replaced by another social media web page !Dorsey crossed the line and he is finished  Die Twitter die
is it the market or did this convertible debt kill us for good?
i think twitter has lost 50 percent of their users who would never come back since people found non censoring alternative solution
ROTFLMAO --->unSocial media WILL turn on the democrats in a heart beat.ie. ---Elizabeth Warren's plan to regulate tech giants.
The tech wars have begun and the #$%$ Jack Dorsey?s company will crash on Monday.
"Censorship and cancellation is the core of TWTR. That's why it will fail & why I dumped it for greener and pro-freedom opportunities. Suppression of any expression is antithetical to understanding; if someone's ideas greatly offend you or everyone else, you can just ignore it. Despite the current popularity of ""Safetyism"" words can't harm you, only you can with your own serious mental distortions."
Does anyone know which metrics twitter reports. I have uninstalled twitter on 3 of my android apps. hopefully they know that. I still access my account via the web and I haven't de-activated my account just yet because I do like to follow a little bit of sports news.is de-activating my account useful.. or is the lack of use enough.
“Can you spare some loose change or a share of Twitter?”
Back to 56 cent.

"Do the following facts indicate a buying or selling/shorting opportunity for Twitter: negative earnings, no dividend, small number of shares shorted, controversial CEO, lawsuit filed against the company for child sexual abuse on Jan, 20, recent loss of up to 100 million platform users, and the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab. Seems clear to me that the stock price of Twitter is more likely to go down than up."
Project Veritas has recordings of the CEO of Twitter discussing the censorship of the Titan .. they say that there are multiple people within Twitter who have volunteered to denounce their boss !!
Checking in on the 45 Fanboys and Karens who wanted short Twitter. And now your buy is on trial! 
Twitter just created a new cencorship tool for all of its leftist users to silence conservatives...as if you needed any more reason to delete you account.
"The Left promotes a cultural of DEATH: dead babies- abortion, dead soldiers- endless foreign wars, dead birds including bald and golden eagles- wind turbines, and a ""dying"" economy via executive orders, onerous regulations and taxes."
