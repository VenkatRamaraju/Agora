So much bearish sentiment from retail. Pinterest has a higher market cap than Twitter now and generates 1/20th the revenue. Good time to buy. Conservatives need to stop whining (and I am a conservative).
"OutlookShares of Twitter have skyrocketed 135% over the last year, which crushes the S&P 500’s 15.3% climb and also tops Amazon’s AMZN 76%. This climb includes a nearly 50% surge over the last three months on the back of its impressive first quarter.Looking ahead to the second quarter—which the company is set to report on July 27—Twitter is expected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 112.5% to touch $0.17 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 72.7% to reach $0.76 per share.The company is projected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $700.02 million. Meanwhile, for the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to reach $2.94 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge."
Jack should be focusing on increasing shareholder value than picking fights with the President. Twitter is a communication platform for people to share ideas etc. Don't be the gatekeeper on what is true and what is not. If people are not discerning enough to do their DD it's up to them. You can literally google to find out if what the president says is true or not (regarding policy). I would advise y'all to sell/short this under performing stock. Jack doesn't know what his priorities are.
How can TWTR have the same market cap as ROKU?
"I have to admit that it took longer then I thought. MFool out now with an article “3 reasons why Twitter has more growth ahead”. no link because I’m not promoting them, such flip floppers."
TWTR up 2.25% Smooth sailing. Extra boost if M & A goes well.
This dog won't hunt. $40 stock at best.
"TWTR, great coverage on Super Bowl! Great to see the world using TWTR for their Super Bowl experiences! Holding 6K+ shares! Looking forward to Thursday! $50+!"
Dorsey is way out there and liberal. Reminds me a little of Howard Hughes towards the end of his life. See what money does to you.
Ouch! Down once again. Heading back to $60/share by June.
"Question for the logical: ""If one tests positive for COVID-19 anti-bodies, a vaccination will do ... what exactly?""Corollary: ""How long does immunity last for those who develop anti-bodies naturally (or have enough T-Cells where infection is virtually impossible) versus those who develop anti-bodies due to a vaccine?""Science is cool."
Down 15 % !
Did $TWATR and even the blog to communicate issues go down last night? Asking for a friend.
"I love America so much. I was planning to buy a business there and employ people . I am praying for you to overcome this evil that is worldwide , I’m in communist Canada , we are almost done ! People are waking up though to fight this tyranny. We will win!!!! Majority of Canadians are praying for you and we stand beside you in this fight.God bless America ."
Nobody trusts the numbers they gave.. Can't trust a #$%$ Run Company...
gotta feeling the big boys at twtr are selling. going wayyyyy down!
"Twitter we have unusual Bullish call option activity￼. MAY 14th exp. 54.00 calls. Contracts placed today 7,384. We go up."
"Deleted all social media accounts, and boycotting all PGA advertisers."
"Not wise to ""catch a falling knife""."
"I scooped at the bottom. It's oversold. The revenue and earnings beat that's what we needed, though not a good future prediction. Therefore, It'll at least come back halfway to $62.00 level tomorrow morning. GLTA"
VANGAURD has been adding up to 7.22% ownership!
Do we care that Tiger Hedge Fund added 9.5 million shares in first quarter?

If The Share Price Falls Through $51.92 Which Is The 200 DMA! It Will Enter The Spiral Of Death! Right Now All That Is Holding This Bird Up Is Cathie And Options!
Less than two months occupying the White House and it's already clear that with the Duke of Dementia and the democrats in charge of things it's tantamount to giving your preschooler the keys to the car and telling them to go get you a pizza. Nothing but a complete disaster. Elections stolen have consequences.
obama took us to the 60s and obama 2.0 took us to the 70s
"Can someone confirms that the CFO mentioned in the recent ER conference that TWTR’s advertising bug problem will even be extended to the next quarter (which is the Oct-Dec quarter). If this is correct m, TWTR May not recover in this current ER. Please confirm. Tnx."
Something doesn't feel right ... SELL!! QUICK!!
Going under 60 tomorrow
"Wont be long and Americas newly elected communist party will need to fund Twitter to keep it alive. They need to keep Twitter in business to keep pushing the agenda, and censoring those who won't follow their orders. The establishment knows what is best for you. Enjoy your free loaf of bread."
Twitter is liable for any Jewish lives lost in Israel. This legal liability could easily run into multiple billions.

Great entry point
Hopefully we get a good up week.
Normal people leaving TWTR in droves. Its just a wasteland of CommieBots now.
"Just setup for 45-46 of good earnings. That’s 10% from here which ain’t bad. Those expecting the moon, I’ll take it if it happens but it’s been a good run and I am patient."
"As a Twtr investor, you have to expect days like this. In fact , you should be accustomed to days like this. As long as the long term trend is up, just relax and either add more shares or take the day off........"
Ha Ha!
twitter is done!
buy twtr target 38
Ouch! Now down 4%.
"Once again, TWTR management (Dorsey/Segal) screw the shareholders by negative comments on the CC after an initial pop on results. Happens too often! Especially after Snap and FB results. Always making excuses. Did not appear they bought back any shares even when the PPS was less than $21 with the $2 billion they announced. These guys need to move on to a non profit company, they have no business running a public company! Shareholders need to vote against the slate of BODs in the next annual meeting coming up, and let Elliott and Silver Lake take the lead!"
$55 is the bottom for TWTR.Sell now.Baden wants the collapse of stock market.China will win.
"Twitters actions will spell the demise of the company, the Democrats and their policies and actions will just accelerate the demise, along with the demise of the economy, the stock market, and our country! As much as I hate to say it.....America is in a lot of trouble with a future that is scary and uncertain more than any other time in our history!"
Market up and TWTR down. What would happen market sold off?
Just wait until employees with stock options start quitting
Hopefully this and square go bankrupt and Dorsey can pitch a tent and live in Africa like he wants
Do whites have to apologize for being really good at what they do or for being different?
Weisselberg's flipping on 45. Manhattan > Mariposa.
Why is it still going down?
"forced under the trend line, that changes things - gotta get it back today"
"To all twitter shareholders take a look at the comments, twitter is getting this strong of a reaction on Yahoo finance. Imagine what reaction they have to their twitter accounts. They are leaving by the millions and this still hasn't reflected that In it's share price"
You got a love Twitter to invest in the stock. ￼
Massive amount of deactivated accounts coming next quarter!
Ouch! Down again ...............................
Can’t believe market makers are keeping price down . Should be over $40.
"Along with the tabulating of illegal ballots, voting machines supplied from the DNC backed Dominion Voting Systems will become the focus over the next couple of weeks exposing the massive level of election fraud that took place on Nov. 3, 2020. Once all this irrefutable evidence is brought before the SCOTUS the true winner of the election can be announced with confidence."
45 coming Jan 2019
"If you want to see the chart $TWTR will emulate, please overlay $PINS for the 2 days after their earnings announcement. There are no coincidences."
Commie red after hours. Twitter loves the color red.
"Once we shake these $40 sellers, 45 here we come"
"I got an idea what these little spikes are throughout the day. Reminds me of the Dominion-voting on election night and then when the Georgia Senate races were being reported. Big difference here! The clock doesn't run out, so every buying binge gets followed by reality setting in. Can't fake buying pressure but so long..."
"Here's what rising GOP star Elise Stefanik said: ""...more than 140,000 votes came from underage, deceased and otherwise unauthorized voters--in Fulton County alone."" Which means she's claiming more than 25% of the votes cast were fraudulent in Fulton. A lunatic claim by any standard. I'm not opposed to a traditional pro-business, low-tax GOP at all. But this is Cult stuff, and it can't end well."
"Jack Dorsey needs to go, Twitter needs a full-time CEO"
Let's see if we can end the day at $52.69. Just a guess. Others?
I'm waiting for the stock to hit 21 and then loading up
Just how low will it go?
"In other news today - Twitter management reconsiders the banning of a former President in hopes of saving the company from certain SP reversal, and ouster of of its founder and CEO. ""sources say"" ""an invitation to the former President, titled (PLEASE COME BACK), is being hastily drafted by the board of directors. Though agreement on wording of the invitation is causing some delays."""
Yahoo must censure all comments at this forum if they want to keep 1984-like censure alive in USA!
Economic growth will happen. Right wing reactionaries will resent it.
The fact that we are in a stock market correction and TWTR is up 17% in December!! Love that!!
As soon as twotter started messing with free speech I started shorting them. Cashed in big on them put today
Cathie wood is just following the hype. It is good when you guess right. It is bad when you guess wrong. She was on the news before because she was guessing right and now she is paying the price for guessing wrong
As predicted. When twitter misses it ALWAYS Closes near days lows and keeps fading. Burn. Baby. Burn.
It’s funny how this company takes down my posts when I’m negative on Censor Jack. I guess all liberal social media companies are in cahoots with each other. What a shame.
1930's Germany would have loved Twitter...
Will the CEO keep his job?
They need to get rid of Dorsey now!
"Will be a clazy clazy week for earnings. No matter what earnings are Friday for twitter, they have a huge future,"
"regardless, will go up later in the day or by noon.."
TWTR WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE $60. This is not a hot take or an outrageous proposition. It’s just the truth.
So this is where all those extreme right wingers that I hear urban legend about up in Canada hang out huh
Nobody buying. Still so many sellers who are unloading massive profits.
Twitter is no more an amateur company like several years ago. Its advertising resource is wide range. Recently I see many famous companies put ad on twitter. The behavior of some companies on twitter will not have any big inference on twitter. Hold this stock for a long time is the best investment strategy for a stock like twitter.
Big guy doesn't even know what's going on much more solve problems. More downside coming because of the economy crashing.
TWTR Target - $5
"it's good to see this much people hate Twitter, I wish soon we find a better platform with respect to freedom of speech, that day will be the end of Twitter"
This beauty of a stock is gonna make me good money tmmrw
Who isn’t a least a little saddened by the West family breakup? The heavily marketed IG and Twitter escapades will be less exciting in the future but we’re sure they’ll think of something. I’m proud of Kim for getting this done.
here comes the reverse split. nothing but bots running twitter and nothing but bots pumping the stock. whoever is advertising on twitter is losing a lot of money. advertisers should be the most angered people with twitter but big brother is keeping a pretty good lock down of free speech therefore no ones allowed to say anything
"PINS is getting GIGANTIC push down. Affecting here. We may see similar very, very soon."
TWATR stock price could die an evil death this week; slow or fast. There just isn't any support except ARK and they are probably tapped all in now with no more buys to execute. Support at $52.40 goes and it's easily 40s within a day.
Buyout is now off the table.See you all at + $100 in 2 years on our own.
"TWTR should rally tomorrow thanks to FB!!!! Multiple Phase 4 results coming up from leading institutions...ACRX 8K out!!! April 28, 2021: ""Catalent is our (ACRX) contract manufacturer that will operate the high volume packing line..."" Catalent is manufacturing MRNA, PFE, JNJ... COVID-19 vaccines, etc. HUGE for ACRX, hidden gem!NOTE the ACRX milestones:March 15, 2021:""Importantly, this also clear the path to finalizing discussions on out-licensing DSUVIA or DZUVEO in Europe. We plan to have an agreement later this year with a potential partner for Europe.""""I would like to provide a few other important updates before going into the financial review. First, our high-volume automated packaging line that has been held up in Europe because of COVID has finally shipped. We expect to receive the packaging line at our contract manufacturing facility by the end of the month."""
TWTR is MySpace 2.0
The run to the exits is expected to be a heavy flow for the next several weeks. There will be a few DCBs (dead cat bounces) intermediately but there is just no support save a few random prop-pressers ...It is important to focus on making profit UP or DOWN. Ideology will hurt profits.
74 million of us tired of media suppression. The next protest should be at the Twitter home office. No violence.
I hope this tanks to the low 30s
"FB is in the process of introducing a self-publishing platform for independent writers and journalists, ...new competitor of twitter,twitter to 66"
There are no catalysts and guidance that led to this run from 40's has been retracted. This will continue to drift down. EBIT dropped from $264M to $63M. Hedgies hoodwinked you by revising the expectations to very low levels for the easy beat. The qtr over qtr picture is devastating. Go see the Yahoo quarterly financials for yourself to uncover this scam.
"Plenty of room to run, stock will be picked up to add to all those index funds!"
Big win for Twitter on Overwatch League. Gamers are mostly on Twitter and this will bring in new brands for advertisising.
CEO admitted he did wrong by banning the Hunter laptop story despite more hard physical evidence than you ever are going to see.
Twitter is down 13.95% to 56.01
"Down to $10 please￼￼, I will be all in"
Yikes
"TWTR shall be a $75 dollar stock when FB is over $190. After all, Facebook is the company got caught reselling all the Facebook members' private datas for advertisement profit and revenue. TWTR is the major social media machine that provides the best discussions and news than Facebook. My son connects with the cardiologists all over the world such as Europe, Asia, United States, Turkey and many more in Twitter for his professional research and study exchange. Those who haven't done so are falling behind the technology update and growth."
"If you have spent anytime around children in the past year while they are on a device, you know about Roblox. And if you're a parent, you also know about Robux (Roblox currency) as your credit card may have gotten charged by purchases made in-game. All I could think about was 'revenue' and when is the IPO.Developers have been looking for a new platform to take their talents further and also have greater freedom while reaching an entire new and broader age group of gamers.Enter RBLX.Roblox reminds me of Fortnite and Minecraft in popularity & style.I believe Roblox will be even more successful than Fortnite & Minecraft though.Roblox is more than gaming, and similar to Fortnite, will take entertainment and social media to a new level that many can't grasp...especially if you're over the age of 40.Roblox is capturing majority of the 6 to 18 year olds, and in the next 5-10 years will continue holding onto these users. Similar to how Facebook users from 2007 were still using FB in 2017...and still to today.That's 10 years of more interaction and huge revenue potential.I also like the fact Roblox has been quite safe for kids as they have been very proactive from my research.And these kids spend at least 2 hours a day on Roblox.For me, RBLX is comparable to $FB, $TWTR, along with $EA. Combine these 3 companies, and I see $RBLX.I'm in at $64.50 and will hold this one for 10 years. Keep buying. Keep holding.I expect RBLX to be at $140+ within 6 months."
"""Twitter 'ALMOST' did something with Clubhouse"" - There is a strain for actual good news.My neighbor ""Almost won the lottery""; he was only off by 3 numbers. The DS financial news folks are straining hard."
Back to .60 cents next week
Small fortune loss in the last two days.....big tech. will not beat Trump....I am just sad that innocent shareholders became cannon fodder in Jack Dorsey's losing war.......MAGA FOREVER
"No real plan to Earn Money.when stock backslides to $25 per share,a top executive from FB, will be poached tobe new CEO."
"The continuing saga of the worst ceo, down 1% today."
"TWTR makes money and has positive cash flow. If they announce a buyback, the stock will be on fire on the rise immediately. They figured out what mistake they made in this quarter, so most likely they will deliver a positive surprise next quarter!"
Rocks in the trees going twee twee.
Haha liberal politics is gunna get u!!!!!Ban anything right allow anything wrong! Left is going to take a beating!!!!
"From the 09 Feb 2021 $TWTR COMPANY Earnings Press Release: For Q1'21, we expect: GAAP operating income to be between a loss of $50 million and break evenHow will a loss affect the share price?"
"Still amazing that of all these Voter Legislation updates, not one has provisions requiring an orderly, on time processing of citizen ballots. Waiting in line for 4-8 hours seems to be okay to these legislatures which is why they required articles in their bills to dehydrate and starve voters in line. But never, ever, do they have to process those voters in a timely fashion. And to ensure there’s a line as far as the eye can see in those big cities, they ensure there are as few drop boxes as possible. That’s your modern GQP"
"Morning Star candlestick pattern setting up... just need that tall green candle on Monday. Hope we get it. If we do, IF we do... I would expect it might go back to the $40's...Honestly, I'm a conservative, and while I don't feel like Twitter is near equal in terms of the left and the right, I don't understand this selloff. I watched a fair bit of the meeting in Washington, and I thought Jack did pretty well. Certainly did better than Google or Facebook. I think he genuinely wants a platform that is balanced but seems to be struggling with knowing how to get there. In any case, I think this sell off is over done, and I think the technical set up (morning star) is an indicator that many other members of the market think so too. Not sure it turns a full on reversal and bull trend... it may just have a solid bounce day that eventually leads to further movement down. But I feel pretty that twitter isn't going to shrink below this support level without some kind of good fight to hold onto it. Again, I think the technicals (morning star potential set up) is indicative of this fight back that is brewing, which is why I think we get a solid bounce on Monday. What happens beyond that... I'm not sure. I can only say that it would fulfill the morning star candlestick pattern which is a bullish reversal signal indicating it should continue to go up ...IF Monday comes through with the completion of that morning star candlestick pattern. Have a nice weekend."
Censor and ban 1/2 the country....what could possibly go wrong?

"Twitter is going to fail, can't do what ever you feel like doing, to suppress right wing info and push skewed left agenda. you got share holders that will retaliate!"

"The countdown has started for the House to be taken from the dems, just like in 2010."
"Over 5.3 billion tweets about some kpop band on TWTR.. ""And now the social media platform has confirmed it: 5.3 billion tweets referenced K-pop on Twitter over the 12-month period, the site announced this week.According to Twitter, the 20 countries where audiences were tweeting about K-pop throughout the last year were: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru,the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam"" I really hope all the people who sold after last earnings even though TWTR was exceeding expectations lose out big when TWTR finally does takeoff hopefully they miss out. Nobody knows when but when elections near and all this revenue is accounted for I believe I will be one happy investor."
"As an addendum you can find easily, $TWTR EPS average estimates are as follows;2021 - $0.88 per share2022 - $1.13 per shareIF they hit average estimates, TWTR is 4+ more times overvalued than Facebook. $TWTR is not a new start-up but considered a decently long-in-the-tooth legacy tech company founded in 2006, now 15 years old. Can you believe it???"
Wow they cant dump enough shares today
Someone please tell al that this DOG stock has been down for 7 years and Crashed waaay off its high with zero hope of doing anything this quarter. Thank you in advance.

Wow! The Yahoo sweat shop workers are really hitting on the down likes tonight. I wonder if they are making minimum wage yet. I hear they will do anything for the Yahoo establishment.

You all know the great 45 is sitting home right now laughing hysterically at this pig  stonk crashing 30% this month 
$42.50 is soft support for this junk. Expect it to blow through that level on the way down to $35.

Wow, racist move backfire!"
Twitter banned the hashtag #1984 yesterday. What does that tell you about them?
above $25 EOD? now $24.32.
"If it can go down $2+, then it can certainly go up $2+. GLTA longs."
"Listen, the entire market is down because of the tariffs. This has nothing to do with Twitter. I would bet that we end up in the green by end of day."

I was a committee person in one of these counties and a call the powers to be. I was told that they all were scratching their heads. Goes to prove, “ Many a true word has been spoken in jest”."

I Think Somebody Made Cathie Mad! lol
This junk stock has flatlined. More of the same in the coming weeks as the share price attempts to find a bottom. Soft support appears to be $42.50 but this junk will go lower as people recognize TWTR has no redeeming qualities and dump their shares before the bottom finally falls out.
"On the back of every NYPD car, there's a twitter logo so you can tweet to the local precinct. I was short at 46, long here."

The Sydney Powell conference (not covered by MSM) was incredible. Social Media companies blocking our 1st Amendment rights will lose a large percent of their base. The crimes committed by the haters of our Constitutional freedoms will soon be exposed to all. The right wing conspiracy theories by those who hate will be proven true. Parler's growth over the past couple weeks mirrors Facebooks back in the day.

Dorsey has made TWTR radioactive. It is time for the BOD to remove him and replace him with someone much less political.
Twitter's number one goal right now is to stir up hatred and division in the United States of America. Jack Dorsey's loyalty is to China. Investing in Twitter is investing in the destruction of the United States.
"Mot-ley Fo-ol brutal on TWATR. ""The reality of the company's historical revenue growth doesn't exactly meet these lofty expectations, having added just $417 million in 2019 and $257 million last year. Not only is this far below what Twitter needs, but growth also appears to be decelerating.""Read it on the Summary TWATR Yahoo! stock quote page. OUCH! DBC for sure."
TWTR BA CPNG AAPL RLX are trading at their bargain price and today speaks volumes.
"I want to buy your shares at just below $50. Longs, HOLD THRU EARNINGS, make my limit buy go through!"
"So GOP standard-bearer Marjorie Taylor Greene is yakking about ""corporate communism"" now. I'll just let that speak for itself."
Twitter NEVER gets a dead cat on day after earnings miss. As I said this should close at days lows and fade for weeks.
very strong buy.
Massive payday tomorrow on TWTR puts. Longs will be turning on Dorsey and there will be no place for him to hide!
So much for the “zero chance this will be over $70” today jibber jabber.

Make America great again!Sell Twitter
TWTR made one of the top ten of the IBD 50 stock list. Do you know what it means? It's going to fly..
"No government grants you the God given rights of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, nor can government take them away.

You love to see the days highs being hit in the morning. Even lib day traders getting burned every day on this one. 
don't worry guys. there will be a frenzy to buy TWTR above $45 tomorrow morning GW.
Short squeeze coming
"Shorted 1 more 1,000at 52.452k shortGL Sorts LOL"
I mean seriously who in their right mind is buying at this price? This stock was $20 in March. It wasn't even worth that much then.
"dems continue to turn their cities into open public toilets, car jacking fests, homeless encampments and out of control shootings....no worries, taxes will be raised and services cut to pay for the excrement display and free needle hand outs....tee hee.....enjoy the bouquet"
"TWTR will soon become a forum for politicians and the riches and the famous and the high profile to express their opinions or transact business deals which may affect the market movement. As soon as it becomes a forum , ad revenues will make the stock higher. I am waiting for the 60's by year end."
CNBC SAYS $50 if Twitter close above $37 today. Hope they are right.
"Anyone else notice john, err “mr personal responsibility” shuts up when he has the first entry on the Top Reactions page? Yeah that shallow"
On Oct 29 2020 TWTR stock lost 25% on a bad news. W/O any big change or improvements they inched there way back up with a 2G stock buyback. Now don't expect them to get out of this one. The TWTR platform was a big part of that on going disastrous vicious political game. You can't eat your cake and have it. It's time for them to pay for their greedy irresponsible behavior. Early this week many will start to keep their distance from TWTR and the stock price will fall hard and fast
tsla EV cars are the future!!!!!!
I see Dorsey still pumping up his failing company.
"I love how all the personalities here on Yahoo Finance are blathering and bloviating about how Twitter is paying the price for 'censoring conservatives' and that Twitter 'dead.' Yeah, OK. A company that generates over $3 Billion in revenues annually and over $2 Billion in CASH is just going to lay down and die. Sure.If you believe that, then I've got a nice bridge in Brooklyn that I'd like to sell you.These same clowns were blathering similar garbage about Intel when it dipped to $45. 'Intel is going to $30!' they said. 'Intel has no engineering leadership.' they said. Within a week, Intel, with billions in cash, hired a new CEO and was at $65 per share within a month.So enjoy being naïve for a week and stroking your ego. While you're doing so, remember why Jack Dorsey earns $200 Million a year. The rest of you with some sense, see you at $75 in a month."
Ban TWTR FB and Google from your portfolio and your lives. I use duck duck go for search.
The user numbers are down because it is a ghost town. People have move on to different platforms.
Buy 10 million shares now
"I spent a few hours on Friday deciding whether to purchase shares of Pinterest or Twitter. Twitter won because Dorsey took an aggressive swing against Zuckerberg. I love men who speak out against injustice, so I purchased 1000 shares - now my largest position since the financial crisis."

DEFUND TWITTER! Thanks! We need to send a clear message to all social media platforms that if they practice censorship they’ll be shutdown and driven to bankruptcy by the its users! POWER TO THE PEOPLE - Not Twitter.

Twitter as a microblogging platform is here to stay! Most celebs are already on it! The potential for revenues from video is enticing!
"Watch out for the summer! ""Sell in May and Go Away"" does mean something. This is not good for the markets. From Dow Jones:""The monthly jobs report showed employers added 266,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rose to 6.1%. These figures significantly missed the expectations of economists who estimated that payrolls grew by one million and the unemployment rate fell to 5.8%. It sat at a record 14.8% in April 2020 in the midst of the early stages of the pandemic.""We were very surprised,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance, adding that he thinks that the economy will continue to recover, but at a slower pace than expected."""

Trump For Twitter And Make America Great again . The $55.00's For Twitter . Hold long and strong
"Twitter, look at the price of this stock and they do nothing. You could buy more than half the stocks on the Dow for less than this. You could also buy a real stock like Coca Cola. What is it Twitter do again? Oh right they advertise stuff, and sell their users information to third-parties. That's their entire business model..."
Last stock that I would buy right now is.. drum roll please.. you guessed it!! TWATR!!

"At this point, I'd like to profusely thank the liberals/gays for buying their goddess/ comrade Twatter while I was shorting it at $74 to $78. Now I made a fortune and with that, liberals lost while I won."
"BUYERS BEWARE: You are not investing in a business that aims to be profitable for shareholders. You are investing in a political organization whose price depends solely on the actions of their far-left activist of a CEO. If you own shares, get out while you can. Dorsey is acting against shareholder interests."

Twitter is going to be really expensive if someone wants to buy twitter.. $100 bucks a share...cheers
Yahoo is as guilty as Twitter for controlling speech. Any news that certain governors have been accused of treason will be quashed. Any news critical to the liberal press is potentially blocked. Thank God for competition—Yahoo will go down in flames with Twitter. JMHO.

The billions in taxes the state and local goverments collect will do alot of good for the people."

"Remember blue hair has no money to buy stuff, all they have is outrage. No sane people will join Twitter when the platform is just a pool of angry www000kkkeee blue hair.

you have to be delusional to think that the stock is worth anything over three dollars a share!
CRASH ALERT! TWATR NOW UNDER $54 AND FALLING!

I hope this tanks 50%. Activists should not run the company. This Jack bin laden is ruining the company
This was up one dollar and five cents an hour and a half ago. Fade to open? Let us pray. For America.
Twitter what’s to be in charge of determining what is best for the public￼. This brick is falling fast!
so it turns out systemic Twitter racism by left wing blue check liberals isn't so great for the Stock...shocker
Nice! Three times the normal volume to the downside and picking up steam. This junk stock is now broken with no visible signs of support until $42.50. Couldn't happen to a nicer group of woke blokes!
Should be at least a $40 stock just on potential and fact their profitable.
This thing is tanking again!!!

TWTR cannot earn a profit.Stock price should be $12 per share.

"who ever bought at 80, don't worry. you will be laughing when this explosion to $100 at earnings happens"
Wow TWTR purging everyone so they could HideTheSteal when it All Comes Out in Arizona
Will never see under $30 again. Will see $45 over next couple months. Way under valued.
Imagine the hit that tech will take if apple sinks more than 5% after earnings on tues. could easily happen.
"What is the deal with all the Bill Gates stuff? Naked parties, Epstein, divorce, affairs ... are things about to get a little hot for some of our self proclaimed oligarchs? I have to exclude Jack from associations with females, he may just be a man-ose-xual or pedal-o-file (sp on porpoise)."
"Wait for it, wait for it … Lizzy will be a MessNBC or Clinton News Network contributor in less than 90 days. Why wait to hear it on the echo chamber TWATR???"
Can $TWTR catch $PINS and $SNAP on the way down today? They are lagging the leading horses in the nose dive ... give it time.
"Who sells after 20% drop on moderately good report? Isn't it obvious that we will see SP bounced back, even if global trend changed to downward (what is not proven yet)?"
Lol. I see the comments so much hate. It great product the 3 social networking biggest in the world you make on me laugh great growth every year and over 200 new user per quarter it coming bigger. Becoming more great with the Space. And going to make go great company. Trump maybe possibly to come back in the future. GG to everybody Twitter is great product. And I sleep good in the night in Twitter stocks.
last chance
Down 6 days in a row? Twtr has lower market cap than snap?Unbelievable. Company needs new leadership.
"If TWTR is still around in 10 years, they will have lost a Trillion dollars or more"
If there’s one thing we’ve learned after two impeachments where the outcome was tweeted far before the proceedings were done - doesn’t really matter. Multiple appeals coming. Time served?

"Morgan Stanley’s 5.6% stake, about $1.3 Billion, is a big stake in twitter. Having acquired it in Q4 2018 their cost is likely in the $28/share range. That puts us longs in good company. You got to believe they are speculating a takeover or merger and want to be part of the action. I’d take news like this over any one analyst’s upgrade or opinion. This certainly puts a backstop to Twitter’s share price given no market correction of size occurs. I’m thinking we fill the gap back to $35 share over the next 2-3 sessions."
"Cancelled my Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon accounts."
This stock is still cheap
I am not worried. after earning report $50 stock GW
"I'm short with this twitter. I lost today maybe I jumped too soon my view is bearish don't see this around in the future. We do use it , don't like the boss, against censorship, propaganda."

Just checking in on the conspiracy nut jobs...Fly Birdie Fly!
"ha, ha, TWTR is going to bankrupt very soon!"
Another billion gone from market cap! oooof
Google and Facebook are a much better advertising option. You will have a wider demographic reach and a broader political spectrum target. Zuckerberg understood this and why he was a bit more reticent on the ban hammer than Dorsey despite increasing pressure.
I love all of you.
Wow Tank Job during rally!! This is a BAD sign!!
Keep selling baby!!!!
My post got deleted also. A few bad apples are destroying American values and making censorship the norm.So I say it again. Twitter can't be censoring tweets and monetizing vampire accounts that ex-users have clearly disassociated from. This calls for an investigation to find out if Twitter is committing fraud.
Parler a much better platform
TWTR just keeps on going up while donnies doofuses remain in denial. that they support a defunct cause.
"Just sold for a small loss I hope to get my money back with ALLYa much better stock (got in at 53.10 sold TWTR at 52.92) Check out ALLY's stock chart, bouncing off its 52week high and it pays a dividend. That is the kind of stock you keep and make money."
Who on earth would buy this now? Markets are all green. Downtrend nowhere close to over. And this is STILL up 79 percent YOY.

"Wait, why is the stock down hard today? Because there was an account that may have been imitating Putin? Is that it, or is there a legit reason?"

"Marjorie Taylor-Green is now my favorite whackjob on Capital Hill. She's entertaining as hell. A little sad to watch after the first few minutes, but it's kinda like watching a chimpanzee play with its own feces....you know you shouldn't be watching it, but you just can't help yourself. Her and Matt Gaetz would make a pair.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Marjorie And Gaetz Amok"
"In light of the Chauvin conviction lawmakers Gym Jordan, Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Green have tabled legislation requiring all police to remove their knees from the necks of handcuffed perpetrators no later than 8.5 minutes after application, particularly when there are only three additional Officers available as backup.In other news, Matt Gaetz has been nominated by previous President David Dennison as Secretary of Child Services when the Turnip regains power. Gym Jordan has been promised the post of Secretary of Sport.Marjorie Taylor Green will be put in charge of Area 51 and the Bermuda Triangle as Secretary of Weird.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Attorney Got Audio? (fourteen thumbs down please....thanks)."
Twitter's treatment of conservatives is unapologetically racist and degrading and in clear violation of the 1st amendment.
"Been all over board today. Over $40 and then under $40 . I don’t believe the $1 billion bond issue is a negative. I guess when consider the drop in FB shares, were doing great."

"This guy has a lot of question marks and lilt in his voice for a News Man. In 2 weeks we’ve gone from white supremacist mush, with tuck teasing his always handy hate of dark skinned foreigners spreading the covid. Then, he promotes conspiracy about the vaccine, mask wearing, and health guidelines. For icing he attempts to dismantle our own viewing perceptions of the Capitol riots. Tweet it out there, Tucker has to go, or Fox needs to be dismantled. Both would be best for the nation."
"As a staunch liberal myself, If you don't see what Twitter, Facebook and others have done, then you really need to reevaluate your civil liberties...Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel even condemns their actions..."

"So jobless claims rise greater than expected, new taxes are imminent, home sales are down 10% ... of course the market goes up! Ah, the good old year Y2K. The Q is, who is pumping the fake billions each day into the market, maybe our friends at the Fed (private bank)? Methinks so."
Did a certain CEO just sell $160 million of Square shares???????
Let’s go!!!! Fade to close. What a beautiful day.
Volume is almost non-existent. Meow. BE CAREFUL. FRY-DAY
$35 by Friday?
Can it close at $41 today $43 by Friday
Deactivated my twitter account. I find it comical that when you click deactivate the only message you get is: Sorry to see you go. #GoodByeWho knows what will happen to the stock. I sold my mere 400 shares in my retirement account Friday. I'm out because I cannot be a part of a company that is clearly attacking our rights.
Let’s put politics aside. Why would any long want to buy this? There is NO reason.
"I expect a $39 in a week or 2. Why ? Read below1/ The ER was at 5.00am, just before open market. This stock didn't have enought time and an overreaction is a normal situation in this context.2/ The market plunges by 1.46%, 0.66% and for the DOW 0.3%3/ The open price was 37$ before the market plunge.4/ We expect a good ER for Apple.5/ A bad overreaction is often followed by a good overreaction6/ The price is under the overage Price Target7/ The price do not include the good DAU (100M$ this quarter)8/ Look at FB in 2016 when the CFO said they're expecting a slow growth the next quarter, the stack plunged despite good ER, and then the stock up back.9/ To finish, you're a shareholder of a profitable company. This company earn money, that mean, this company could be bought anytime by a big tech. Don't be afraid by those who sold their share in panic."
On Fast Money they all said buy Twitter. Advertising is doing well.
"No reason to buy here, they are losing market share to other platforms."
"Few new users, while losing old users, equals Garbage Stock."
"Twitter is omnipresent in our lives, this is the very first global media in the world. Will be at three digits in no time."
Bottom line was today was another day in the red. Lots of stocks were up. Heck the Dow was up. Cathie Wood won’t save you libs. But Keep chasing.

"dam, was hoping for anothe quick dip under 53, oh well - happy i got what i did. onwards!"
TWTR is a BS machine. Their CEO claims they could do more to be transparent. So why now? Why not since their inception? TWTR is a BS scam company. No one should trust their CEO or employees.
apociram in a mirror!
"If Twitter ever puts themselves on sale, for real, there is going to be a bidding war that the stock market has never ever seen.Twitter is the cheapest property in the world's richest neighborhood.

New days high on the way here. 
"buy here and hold for 5 years ,and you will be very happy"
was a dead cat bounce this morning to try and hold above $50
"All the bears need to chill out and rethink their position. One of the first things to do is accept that you were on the wrong side of the trade and consider getting out. We've all been wrong. Getting emotional about it and bashing Twitter isn't going to help. Twitter doesn't show the characteristics of a bubble for the following reasons: 1) It's still one of the least hyped-up stocks this year. Its movement hasn't been straight up parabolic like many other stocks. 2) Its revenue has actually been going up along with many other important metrics (like monetizable users). 3) Guidance for Q4 is low because it's trying to grow headcount and invest in itself. Companies can't be making money all the time. They have to think about the future. You all seem to have forgotten that Amazon took almost 10 YEARS to turn a profit. 4) Even if Twitter's rise doesn't make sense, the bears must realize that the euphoria can still screw them over until they're bankrupt. As a reference, the Tesla shorts got completely wrecked ($2.5 BILLION in ONE day). And Tesla's rise has definitely been euphoric. Doubling down on short positions can cause a massive squeeze, making people double down more, causing a more massive squeeze. Yes, the bears could be right, but they would still lose money in that case. So, think over your positions carefully. Be logical about it instead of emotional."
Conservatives say libs have no jobs but then spend their entire day on yahoo complaining...

"Liberal Twitter has been discriminating against Conservative Christians. Karma. This will never go back up to its former highs as tens of millions like myself left and stopped ads for their businesses, like what I did and people I know."
no matter how they try to prop this up subscribers are not coming back.
Remember when the commie longs laughed on earnings day when I said that we just witnessed the last time that twitter would ever trade over $60 during market hours?!? I do. 
AZ election forensic audit started what took so long how is the evidence not been tampered with?

Ouch guys. Good luck
We may end this week 33-34?
If you are looking for something else. Check out NLST. They just settled for years of patent infringement with SK HYnix last month and received 40 million cash plus 600 million supply agreement patent sharing between companys and collaboration on their new Hybridimm product. They beat Google in June of last year in patent war when the federal appeals court upheld 78 claims on their 912 patent against Google. Patent has been reissued and Google has requested mediation. The mediator was appointed by the court yesterday and we are either going to settle(most likely) or go to discovery and intervening rights in june-aug. Markman hearing is already set but parties think they can resolve with ADR in mediation! :-) Do your DD but this is a new company in a sector starved for inventory who is loaded with inventory after their supply agreement with SK HYnix. Great risk reward.

Just how many of the CDC staff have purposefully NOT agreed to take the vaccine? Oh my. The wheels on the bus  go round and round - AND THEN THEY COME OFF!!!
Only Twits Tweet.
"I was under the impression from Kevin’s tweets on the subject, he felt N Pelosi didn’t properly hire enough Capitol police. She was personally responsible for the scuffles and loud voices and giggle tickles going on that wacky Wednesday. Don’t we want to find out how guilty N Pelisofer is? Don’t we want to pin it on her? Don’t we ant to lock her up? How can we do this is we don’t have an investigation?"
"Jack, Jack, Jack ... the ""Kid App"" $SNAP is coming directly for you'all! I would exit this oinker PDQ:""Snapchat, the reality-augmenting social media app, took its time to ramp up its efforts to profit from the billions of dollars spent by social media users annually. Last week, Snapchat announced its Creator Marketplace, a platform that allows brands to connect with stars and influencers to create product-focused AR content and experiences for users. It also recently acquired Screenshop, an app that identifies products in posts and refers users to retailers that sell them based on user-uploaded photos, and Fit Analytics, a Berlin-based footwear and apparel sizing company that boasts relationships with 18,000 retailers worldwide."""
"Last week on: CNBC - Fast Money analyst/guest - Dan Nathan called TWTR stock "" TOAST "" going forwardFOX BUSINESS - On Charles Payne Show - Fund manager- Mark Tepper of Strategic Weatlh said hee unloaded all his fund shares of Twitter because Twitter block his tweet just telling ""all "" Georgians to vote.Mark said that was the last straw for him on stifing free speech and saw this a negative sign for Twitter's future subscriber growth."
Nice slice off the top of the Twitter entertainment forum. I guess futures  is a good thing. Critical race theory and all.
There is NEVER a bottom after a twitter earnings miss. Let’s kick back and enjoy this. For America. For conservatism.
"There is more backlash against #MeToo than anything else. Jack Dorsey runs a pretty socially conscious company. While it may be interesting to observe condescension and insults toward women on Twitter, it is more reflective of illness in our society, and not a Twitter factor. Left tried to short last big drop with plans to cover at $25. Let's hope he fails again."
Greatest insider play in the world would be buying up shares at damaged stock fire sale prices after banning DJT and other conservatives right before TWTR reversing course and announcing that they will be allowing free exchange of ideas again from both sides.
Ouch! Twiddleedy is down once again!
"85, yup 85 million will be gone,lol, jack good job"
Who wants to target Ads to TWTR Users (aka Vandals and Looters) ?
31 to 32 is a fair value
If it’s fake accounts why does it matter? It’s good that they got rid of them
Invest in Fiverr instead a company which actually does something
Oh shoot Goldman has a article out saying TWTR is not done going up as of yet and the turnaround is better anyone ever thought. TWTR should hit 50 this coming week an upgrade from Goldman as well.
New 52 week high coming after ER? Why not? Might as well get it over with now.
WOW !WHAT A BAGHOLDING.....TIMMMMMMMBER DAY !
yahoo aol facebook and twitter censor free speech....
Most shareholders are base in the US and most doesn’t agree with this type of suppression. Twitter will regret this.
Forget Covid--when was last time Pelosi was tested for rabies?
could be wrong or it could be me but Twitter could be the next step in one of many strategies to take on the likes of cable TV  ....
Mistake not to sell or take some off at recent highs....hope i get another chance
New replacement platforms coming soon to an Internet near you.
Audio chat trend is big. Facebook also has plans.
"Over sold, back to $60 soon!"

"See that little gap from 52.92 to 53.09? That will never hold. It will fill, its just a matter of when. Good stocks might hold that but TWATR is anything but a good stock. Theres another at 50.11 to 50.19. So expect to see 50.11 in TWATR's future for sure."
33-34 todays target
Will Matt Gaetz's plea for legal defense cash take away from the plea for Mar-a-Lago upkeep cash? Inquiring minds want to know. I'd appreciate all thumbs down to validate the above point. Please and Thank You.
"To show how evil TWTR CEO and company are, there were two recent reports in teh news where racism is at the heart of the discussion.1. A former NFL player murdered an entire family in cold blood in their home2. Protests erupt after police shoot Black man in Minneapolis traffic stopTWTR did not censor the second report as invalid due to the response from the same activists not appearing in the first incident. For clear examples liek this it shows where TWTR is one of the social media giants selectively choosing what news to pass through so that it further divides our country. For this reason i do not support TWTR."
Anyone feel this will stay above $32.60 and continue up?
This stock is so unpredictable the options market is long calls and puts for next week Its held support well but obviously its a $60-80 range stock so depends on your risk
End of week 43.00
"Twitter has more content in Real Time.., faster than the others."
Everything about Hunter's laptop was TRUE yet Twitter still censored and tried to quash the story

"Classic Pattern: If the low of the day is at close on a Friday, then the beginning of next week will also be down. Note - That pattern has been bucked a few times, but it is a classic 95% of the time."
"Going to the $30,s"
"This so called Company lost nearly a Billion dollars of shareholders money last year. Just think about that..... $1,000,000,000.00How can that happen??? Why are people still investing in this garbage?"
Today we witnessed history. The last time that twitter will ever trade above $60 during market hours. Clap your hands for America.
Bounce coming... too many shorts on the board
"The Mango Mussolini's new website is not the greatest of technological quality due to the fact that the fluffy faithful have been remiss in their submission of donations to Big-o-Lardo, necessitating the hiring of graduates of the (T)rump University Skool of Grafik Artz for the website design. Shortly this board will be abandoned by the fluffy faithful as they start their exodus towards Parler and the planning of the next Capitals Tour. Now, my typical 7-12 thumbs down, please and thank you.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - Mulvaney and Giuliani AWOL?"
Most users are same bots with multiple accounts. I bet they lost users!!
I hope this enemy company goes bk and every person who works there receives the bad karma they have well earned.Thanks.
"Let me be very clear here $TWTR didn’t make money before 80M users left the platform, because of censorship run wild. Upgrading the stock is radically irresponsible and should be investigated by the SEC immediately!"
Good!! I hope it’s on the way down to $30. One side political is the result “freedom of Speech”
LOL Sam Spade is back!! Says it’s time to get bullish again. Got to admire his perseverance.
"I said it on Monday, saying it again today. Never underestimate the power of the Shorts. The Shorts are just getting started on this... Meanwhile Twitter is losing Billions in value."
now elon musk got added to the list of shorts. down goes big tech.
"TWTR has a moat, really no competition on what it does once this is understood by the market it will reprice it accordingly fair value $80."
We should close over $34 today. Then we will continue heading up.
"Wow. Can you see advertising dollars disappearing as now those that advertise must realize that they are appealing to people who know people who know people. Why would anyone buy products or services unless you are one of those in favor of the #cancculture? Dorsey has fully expose his tyranny to all. So out of touch with the common man/women and the heart of what makes America, America."
"Twitter's whole business is about selling YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION to third parties. They likely make $$$$'s per user selling your information to anyone who will pay for it, and that includes BAD ACTORS in foreign countries who WILL STEAL that information. You are a commodity to Twitter. It's a meat market, and they are selling us all. FACEBOOK is doing the same thing. Twitter even estimate what you are worth. This is incredible but true, look it up."
Buy twtr at 25
"Mississippi U.S. senator, Roger Vicker, lauding the covid latest relief bill passage to his constituents because it helps the ailing restaurant industry and yet voted against it. What a swell guy!!"

Will the board take action?
"I want to thank Jack Dorsey for having his account hacked after the market close on the Friday of a 3-day weekend during a fairly busy news cycle with a hurricane, Hong Kong protests, China giving in a little in the trade war, and Iran reaching out to talk to Trump. This could have been much worse. I love you, Jack! Good thinking to get hacked when you did."

Twitter Twatter Squatter.. Regression of a Twitter shareholder..
"Twitter is committing click fraud on its advertisers substantiating those clicks by way of non0existant account.Twitter user base off 75%!!!! Since their conservative silencing.75% of current Twitter accounts are 'restricted' accounts where the user is not allowed to post, follow, comment or CLOSE THEIR OWN ACCOUNT.This company is actively involved in a RICO fraud with class lawsuits imminent."

Why is yahoo holding back the news on the project veritas video of jack saying this is just the beginning?They are all in this together. Not reporting news is lying if you’re a news organization.My post will disappear shortly I’m sure. Commies.
"Twitter DOES NOT make a profit. They are run at a loss, and yet can virtue signal and hand away $10 Million of the shareholders cash."

"‘ I think all of that, but I’m getting the word out because we are doing releases. Every time I do a release, it’s all over the place. It is better than Twitter. Much more elegant than Twitter, and Twitter is really boring. A lot of people are leaving Twitter. It has become very, very boring. When I started with Twitter years ago, it was like a failed thing, concept, a platform, fail. It was failed. And it became exciting. And I think I had a lot to do with it, to be honest with you, it became exciting. Now it is boring. It is no good anymore. The people were telling me.”"
This thing has a chance of going green. I pray that I am wrong. But Our glorious downtrend appears over. I hate commie bulls.
TWTR has set the bar for direct communication. twtr is a very Solid company and will do very well. $150 buy 1.5 yrs.
"Twitter deserves this. Go woke, get broke"
twitter is communist
SUNSHINE TOMORROW!
He's Not coming back...EVER. The Number 1 reason TWTR is still around has left for good and will open his own Free Speech Platform. Sell while you can. You have been warned.
"Bill & Melinda splitzville ... must be trending big on TWATR. Wait, who cares!!! Hahahahaha"
With every passing day/hour/minute the realization sets in that twitter will never see $60 EVER again. And it is amazing.
What's Twitter????
There were so many lib pumpers on here for months. Ironic how they just disappear. Some would say they censored themselves. 
Wouldn’t it just be best for the country if social media didn’t exist?
"Will see 40s soon enough, Hello #WOKE!"
Getting our nice push to $41-42 before earnings. Friday's drop was a nice gift and look at the option premiums already.
Bubble stock finally bursting
"Hope you didn't take the headfake on the 'not news' of 'nothing happening':April 08, 20213:22 pm ET *CORRECTION: Twitter shares are trading higher after a report the company was discussing a $4 billion takeover of Clubhouse. The report said the talks are not ongoing.Benzinga"

Not much of a “fry” day. Unless you were short. About 6 billion in Puts expired worthless today. Ouch.
"Twitter. - A place where unimpressive social misfits can congregate and lend their voices to an echo chamber reverberating with Demdonkey Inc. lies, half-truths and talking point conspiracy theories."
"biden will be forgotten pretty quickly , trump will be remembered for a long long time"

I am sorry for those who own the stock but I am happy to see the bird fall from the sky.
"HOW LOW CAN THIS STOCK GO! Jack I suggest to see if you are eligible for extended Biden unemployment benefits,,,,it may come in handy."
REMINDER: The judge in the George Floyd trial already gave away the next step.That is why the protestors are a bit confused what to do.
Shorting this should be no brainer.
Google appears to be the best Home for Twitter. Google is about Data n Twitter is the data news of the world.
Its impossible to ignore politics when TWTR is a totally political company. People used it thinking it was a neutral patform. Now everyone to the right of Karl Marx knows its not and they can only stay if they ditch every shred of dignity they have and accept whatever weird things demanded of them. The movement away from Twitter is real. This company is finished.
Conservatives let’s get our popcorn out. This is some good pre nfl draft theater.
Everyone sell at the market and go short the games over for the bag holders
"Twitter better be able to monetize itself. Regardless of how one feels about Trump and his policies, Twitter seems to be the universal platform adopted by politicians, celebrities, and activists worldwid who prefer to Tweet vs waiting for CBS or NBC to show up. Any news worthy article today must have tweets inserted as part of the content to validate itself. My guesstimate is the number of users will go up when earnings come out at the end of this month. Will this translate into monetary gains?"
Is there anyone left in TWTR? Today they took down Wall Street Bets
"then again, I think the window to short may be a small one. I expect low 60s high 50s and then continue its uptrend."
It’s nice of big tech to build their own antitrust case for us.
"I said before and would like to say it again, the biggest challenge facing TWTR is to be bought by some bigger company. TWTR is one of the most powerful SM companies in the world and its potential to impact on our society has just been recognized. Give the stock sometime, it will go more than $100 in 1 to 2 years if not being bought out."
My decision to get a stake in TWTR was exclusively based on Dorsey's actions this past winter re: TOS violations. Company leadership is legit.
Over $33 today. Trending up.
A nice 12 to 13 percent haircut today isn't out of the question for this junk company stock.
TWTR may be the most dishonest company anyone could work at.
Twtr strong even all markets down
When Twitter locks you out they don't allow you to deactivate your account. This artificially inflates the actual number of user count so as not to alarm advertisers and affect the Twitter stock price. NOT WORKING!
"“It is dangerous and damaging when any publisher arbitrarily and unfoundedly decides, as it did here, that the facts and policies of a particular presidential administration constitute ‘violence’ — in order to censor them,” Mr. Wolf wrote in a letter to Twitter’s CEO.Twitter is going to get flattened."
"Dorsey has told Xi Jingping he approves of forced labor, little girls and drools at the thought of either."
TWTR should change its logo to a dead duck
"$1,400 stimulus check cost you $5,800. Liberal new math at work! Sorry markets :-("
There's no denying it now --- TWTR is the digital era equivalent of book burning.
"forget the other social media company, TWTR is way undervalued. Bad management, but make no mistake, the potential is definitely there. Don't be surprise if CRM comes back with another attempt to buy them out. If so, TWTR management will probably take it this time"
I bought at $43.12. Will go up to $50?
52 week high today.
"64 percent of Americans reportedly think that social media platforms do more to divide the nation than unite it. This includes majorities of Republicans (77 percent), independents (65 percent), and Democrats (54 percent). The poll also reported that the majority of whites (70 percent), Latinos (56 percent), young adults (61 percent), and seniors (71 percent) all believe that social media is dividing the nation."
Do you feel it slipping? I feel it slipping.
Does anyone have a good securities lawyer? I want to sue twitter for beach of fiduciary duty to shareholders.

"""Slower user growth"". Gee, never saw that coming with a radical leftists commie running the company."
LOL....a fake coin with a dog on it is worth 20B more than this company
"I believe this is an over reaction as they beat their expected revenue and only missed their user growth by a million from what was expected(199m vs200m), i dont think a multi billion company can lose almost 15% in their valuation that quick I believe it can get to 58-60 then back down I personally think thats whats going to happen good luck to yall!"
Can Florida Punish Jack? Documents reveal Twitter failed to properly register in Florida before doing business there
Way past the point of needing a new captain to run the ship
"Big legal trouble for TWTR. On their last 10Q under Risk factors the closest they come to censorship is what others do to them and not the other way around.....This is what I found....actions by governments or others to restrict access to Twitter or censor content on Twitter, such as how domestic Internet service providers in China have blocked access to Twitter and other countries, including Iran, Libya, Pakistan, Turkey and Syria, have intermittently restricted access to Twitter, whether these actions are taken for political reasons, in response to decisions we make regarding governmental requests or content generated by people on Twitter, or otherwise;"
58 by Wednesday
I left twitter because of J. Dorsey and moved on to other platforms .. I don't believe in censoring ANY one. We have a Constitution and Dorsey and Zuckerberg are stomping on our rights with arrogance and indifference to the law of this land. It is not going to end well for this nation if they continue to lock arms with a Marxist political party and silence half this country. I hope this stock goes to ZERO although I hate to see average investors get hurt. Join us and sell your shares and send a message to Dorsey that our rights come from God and we have freedom of speech..
next qtr results will send this down 30%
Sell sell sell and run
market cap 22 billion...this worth 40 in my opinion and I'm sure many companies considering acquiring Twitter right now. longs will be glad...
the desperation buys xD -15% inc
"Once again well done my fellow tweeter, we must march forward to station $50!!! Even then I wouldn’t sell!!!"
"If it Crashed like that when the Markets were hitting new highs , what happens if Markets sell off??"
Bye bye birdie!!
NYT Journalist Erases ENTIRE Twitter After National Pulse Unearths Posts Admitting ‘Working’ For The Chinese Communist Party.
"$SNAP has a tremendous opportunity out in front of it. Numerous years of ~50%+ revenue growth is enough to justify an even greater valuation in my opinion. Long-term we have an easy bull-case: targeting, ad platform, optimization, and Snap Ad analytics improve, enabling eCPM (ad pricing) growth. In addition, new streamlined product (five parts of Snapchat) enable new ad inventory to be opened up. This allows a lot more impressions per user (i.e. higher ARPU). In addition, lack of content moderation costs relative to platforms like $TWTR and $FB enables higher long-term margin profile. In my view, not financial advice WHATSOEVER, this couldn't be a clearer buying opportunity."
Citron will put out a tweet saying they are long TWTR now.
"All across our country black farmers are going to be awarded a billion dollars more than white farmers. When one passes legislation based on the color of a man's skin, not the content of his character, Martin Luther King rolls over in his grave, yet again.

Twitter stock: A PERFECT opportunity to invest in a stock that sooner than later will be worth nothing.
Do you imagine the CCP is enthralled that a majority of US public schooled children are now a year behind in their educational studies? How to lose 101.
"If we (Americans) don’t stop division within, we will follow the footsteps of the Roman Empire. Great book: The History of the Decline & Fall of the Roman Empire was written by English historian Edward Gibbon. At least we can learn what comes next."
"how is this good news ?08:47 AM EST, 03/01/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Twitter (TWTR) said Monday it plans to offer $1.25 billion worth of convertible senior notes due in 2026 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers.The company said it also plans to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to buy up to an additional $187.5 million of the notes.The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of Twitter, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Twitter's common stock, or a combination of both, the company said.In connection with the pricing of the notes, Twitter expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or other financial institutions, the company said.Twitter plans to use a part of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, and the remaining proceeds pay any amounts due upon conversion or at maturity of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions.share dilution ?"
Would be nice to see 40 again by years end.
low 40s
I just watched a video of a lady putting gas in plastic bags then into her trunk. Now I've seen everything.
it's good that a lot of people shorting Twitter when it crosses 50 they will run for cover that will give us another $5-$7 boost.
$52 billion combined losses for twtr and FB since banning President Trump
"Someone buy, someone sell, which is called ""consolidation"". Consolidation could impact on timing, but not direction. To be honest, if you still can't see the direction of where TWTR goes at this time, I am sorry, you shouldn't trade stock, period."
Another failed breakout? Eventually....a breakout here won’t fail. This does not appear to be the week though.
Back to $20 soon
"Fact: Men who think ""TWATR"" is funny and clever are not getting any."
"I don’t know Peter, let’s see if this fLiesThiel, who calls himself a tech contrarian and got his start in Silicon Valley as a PayPal cofounder, has openly criticized Alphabet’s artificial intelligence work with gays and Apple’s reliance on gays for its overall supply chain. Pressed on what legislators can do to stop the “infiltration” of homosexual influence in American technology companies, Thiel offered one piece of advice: keep applying pressure on tech companies. “You need to call people out on that relentlessly,” Thiel said. A Facebook board member since 2005, Thiel also discussed how the social network’s employee base made it more difficult for the company to take a tough stance against Gays. Thiel brought up the debates among Facebook employees during Pro Gay Marriage pro-democracy protests in 2013 as an example for how internal politics prevented Facebook from taking a more anti-lgbtq bent."
The best thing about today is that it closed at low so burned chasers and traders too. This is amazing.
This is gonna fall so hard ( morning ) my advice Sell quickly
One fdddddddd up mkt. Glaring sign this likely drops on great earnings. Help it if it only meets expectations.
sea of red is all i see xD
I am buying Twitter from $30. Even yesterday I bought at 54.80. I am sure it will reach 75 soon
"Longs were warned. Dorsey is toxic. Uncle ""Tim"" comment...give me a break!"
Can we please get a nice fade to close?!! This DESERVES to drop much further.
"Compared to Jack's 28% wealth contribution, Mark's 30 millions and Jeff's 100 millions are jokes.."
"Typical. They need to be grilled about how this can be after the glowing hype of doubling revenue by 2023 announced on investor day. They have not changed that outlook, so disregard this quarters report? Not a real confidence booster."
You gotta be a jihadi like Jack Dorsey to own this stock! Down 20% in the last 30 days and headed to $0!
All My TWTR Friends I Added Some Shares Of UWMC Today It's Going Up More Tomorrow! I'm Still Bearish On TWTR!
But we shouldnt be dropping as this stock has NOTHING to do with Trade or War
If the anti-vax take control. We’ll all have to claim the 45th in a court of law. Did dude get a vaccine? Just askin’....
Can we close over $34 today. I agree with bill we’re on are way to $48.
$40 next friday
They have a very valuable user base. They’ll figure out how to make money vis subscriptions soon. Pretty sure this will be worth over $90 in a year. Bought some more!
When fact checking goes wrong.. should of kept their opinions to themselves and not tried to fact just something that is proven to be right.. trump was right voter fraud does occur that is a mere fact.. so twitters whole fact check was a bs move
Jack Dorsey...#$%$ That's the reason for the HIT!!
Bought some shares in 56$
"Q: How do you build-up a 15 year old legacy platform by alientating 30% of your users, stiffling free speech and selling convertible bonds that dilute shareholder value?Easy!!! Press releases and 'bought analyst' price upgrades!BTW, how are things going over at Goldman? Three big departures in the last few days, look it up."
I see hamas has operatives here in Congress...... omar and talib and aoc are their mouthpiece here in the west. And they play the propaganda game well.
"I for one was never into social media; so I did noot have to ""leave"", but hearing what these big tech is doing, and thinking they can get away with it, I hope those of you who are leaving or have just left understand that Twitter and other similar entities realize they are in the wrong ONLY because they are losing money, and that they will change their ways, that you will NOT go back to them. It's up to you of course but when people are apologetic ONLY because they realize they are making money, and you as consumers go BACK to them, they still win. My hope is that once you leave, you leave for good."
"Anti-capitalist companies shouldn't benefit from a capitalist system, what do you think?"
last chance to buy.. going back to 60
my entry is 53
Haha sold! And sold Apple too. Bye bye CCP stocks.
"Fools. I don't care that it has come down from $80. I just know that I have a $51 and change average and am confident that this will rise to $60+ by end of year. And I'll take a solid 20 percent gain on any single investment over a year. You fake conservative purists would rather hate (some would say ""cancel"") than make money. Liberals are WOKE. And so are this new crop of always outraged conservatives. Makes me sad for this great country."
"Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.00% rose 30 cents to $40.10 on huge volume of 134 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the average. The move came on news the company is being added to the S&P 500 and that it is preparing a $1 billion convertible note offering. Initial target is $42.50-$42.75, and beyond that the channel top points toward $50."
Whisper number is .29. I’ve heard .35 cents. Don’t know on revenue
"Do the current MBA programs teach students to purposefully alienate current and potential customers from their product?I was taught a business must expand potential customer segments (demographics, religion, nationality, political beliefs, etc.) as wide as possible; narrowing may work for a very short time, but it is never viable recipe for product success."
Just cancelled twitter. I see lots of competition coming in and regulations will begin when they see all the conservatives moving to a new platform. I think I’m gonna sell short
I'm ashamed at the whiny conservatives on this board. Y'all whine about cancel culture but seem to want to cancel Twitter. I have never voted for a single democrat my entire life. But this company had a decent quarter. Forget politics when buying stocks. Twitter will rise.
Dow futures up 110 points in the green. Good Luck !
"Never seen a business that thought getting rid of half their customers overnight was a good idea. I wouldn't do business with people that think that way. Makes me think Twitter doesn't care or need money. Probably run by the CIA to control speech and keep and eye on all the citizens, same with facebook."
Another big drop on high column. Timmmmmmmber..........
We Going Next Week To 60$ Easy Cake
I am thinking of buying a new house maybe in Florida or Montana. I'll call it the TwitShort house.
"Hey SEC, any chance of looking at a company which in QE2, declared a loss of over $7 Million while handing away $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM? Also any chance of looking at a company whose CEO has actively discouraged half the users to leave his platform, doesn't sound like due diligence to me."
"Strange. Not yet 50,50$??Will come back later"
"Longs: What are you hoping for between earnings announcements? This is the 'slow time' for SM (social media) ... and will remain slow throughout the summer as folk enjoy the outdoors, their families, work and travel. Political hot potatoes have dried up. I would recommend you at least buy a PUT to protect your investment or exit if uncomfortable. It really could see the 20s again, it was less than a year when it was at that level."
Before earning 50. After earning $60. G w.
"The spill over is everywhere in the MSM and Social Media. How bad will it be for $TWTR???""Cuomo Prime Time"" had its smallest average audience last week since the coronavirus pandemic started to dominate the news cycle across the United States."""
"Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) gains 8.7% pre-market after stronger-than-expected Q1 results as the coronavirus didn't hit ad revenue until late in the quarter.Ad revenue for the quarter was up $3M Y/Y to $682M. Twitter says ad revenue declined 27% Y/Y from March 11 until the quarter ended on March 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic.For Q2, Twitter isn't providing revenue or operating income guidance. The company reiterates that the FY20 outlook was withdrawn.Plans for a new data center will likely be delayed, impacting capex spend in FY20.For Q1, average monetizable DAUs were 166M (consensus: 164M), up from last year's 134M.Earnings call starts at 8 AM with a webcast here."
Twitter is continuing in a downward spiral as the charts show it breaking down on the charts with currently no bottom in site until you get to 39.43 which would represent the 200 day moving average. If it continues downward from there it would be ugly to say the least and would like fall to 29.43 area.
"Sell today and never look back ,tomorrow be down day. Soon $20-$25"
All hands on deck! Man the lifeboats!
"Hey Dorsey, about that $10 Million of share-holders money you gave to Black Lives Matter? So what did they do with it? Who has it now?"
A trading buddy asked me the other day about TWTR and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
"Glad Cramer strongly recommends buying TWTR at the current price! He mentioned in the Lightning Round tonight that he lost 30,000 followers as a results of Twitter efforts to clean up the platform and close fake accounts: that's 3% of his followers, am I the only one to think this pretty clearly shows Twitter's unique users count in Q2 WAS indeed mostly attributable to the cleanup of fake accounts? Absent this (positive) initiative, or if Jack Dorsey had clarified it a little better, I am starting to think actual comparable MAUs might have been up 2 or 3% instead of flat and there would have been no selloff whatsoever after Q2 - Twitter's best quarter ever."
If only there was some kind of saying about losing money when embracing radical leftist policies....
Getting close to short covering pop - if it can hold these levels - could be great week
How low TWTR can go?
"It's a $40 stock, at best."
"Does anyone know what the triggers are on those convertible bonds, any subjective analysis would probably indicate shareholders are getting the shaft when the converts are converted to equity.. a very dilutive effect. But what you expect from a CEO who looks like Rasputin and leans left. Perhaps his right-hand minister of censorship donkey Vijaya could give some of her salaries back when all the shareholders get diluted out.."
"IMO, I don't believe TWTR will hold Support at $55.00 level. Is $45.00 or lower in the cards"
This will see a big swing either way tomorrow could pay off BUT is a big gamble still lots of unknowns. No Replacement for Noto and a PT Jack Dorsey
Google will buy Twitter soon to compete with Facebook and its Instagram. It’s a simple solution for 20 to 25 billions.
"Lib lob media king CBS radio,(880 AM in New York Shetty) said last night that Twitter is doing just fine without the Trumpster on its site..hey,hey,they post record sales and revenues !...well guess what,instigators at CBS..your little Twitter stock is down almost 10% ! ..little oversight i'm sure.Keep your instigating and half-truths going strong !"
Twitter banning political ads? Good!!!
"In one of Ronald Reagan's interviews he said, and I quote. ""If facism ever comes to America it will come in the form of Liberalism"". And it has arrived exactly as Reagan predicted."
"Funny how these random ""buyers"" always seem to buy near the session lows. They're just bagholders trying to pump."
Decisions have consequences
No floor in sight. This is going to get even uglier next week.
"If Chauvin had encountered a staggering and incoherent Limbaugh outside the Breakers with a bag full of Oxy in his pocket and a questionably aged “attaché” on his arm, you know “resisting arrest” - would he have put El Lardo in a 9 minute 29 second choker?"
Contact every website that has twitter and facebook on their site and tell them you are not doing business with them until they remove facebook and twitter from their business website! If you shop at a store leave your cart when they tell you they have facebook and twitter on their website.
TWTR rocks. Amazing what the truth will do for a company...
Nasdaq down .25 percent. This is down 6x that. But keep chasing libs!!!
Shutting down El Trumpo's account was one of those simple-but-not-easy decisions which business leaders are faced with. Dorsey nailed it.
"When Twitter went down to well-deserved $45 in January, suddenly an ""analyst"" from a ""financial consultant"" popped-up to say that everything is great with Twitter and he set a target of $75. OK, the target was reached, with the price of investors that now they are crying for their money.Do not believe these ""analysts"". They may not be fools, but they can the bribed and bought."
Another typical RED day for the establishment.
I sold all my social media stocks. Free speech is a free speech. So if they don’t want us in their platform so my voice go with my money
"Nathonson was just on Bloomberg trying to explain his downgrade.. Complaining that TWTR is over valued & not spending as much as FB on security etc.. One of the most cheesy analyst calls, clearly an axe to grind here.Waiting for the algos selling to settle down around 11.00am ET & then time to start nibbling."
Looks like a solid base establishing itself around $35
21 more countries!! Twitter is growing!
"Before earning 04/25, It's going to hit 40-45 ."
Lower highs...
"Well, for now at least, it looks like the best strategy earlier today was to sell far out of the money puts and covered calls. So much premium. So easy. Stock is up 2%+ now."
Today's buyers are tomorrow's bagholders.
twtr is finished now
Freedom of speech only counts if you say something good about Nancy and Joe but I can't think of any thing. My last post was deleted as usual.
"The only thing that can cheer you Trumpies up is the sugar rush of TWTR shares declining. Well I reckon after the massive repudiation of your golden idol by common sense American voters, no one can begrudge you a cheap thrill."
This stock is a dog-faced pony soldier!
Twitter actively engaged in election fraud by censoring information relevant to the outcome of an election and providing false information to aid in an election.
$45 sounds good
this is going green
its becoming a daily thing to hear twitter is censoring free speech in a new way. yes they are a private company but they should not be in the business of dictating what news is real and not when they have a political bias.
This flea bitten mutt is headed to $30.
Why hasn’t TWTR banned fake news from Washington Post?
"TWTR, a second tier Social Media Company.Has no plan to Monetize product.TWTR lives on Cathi Woods love.Proper valuation $12 per share."
Im getting really scared now! TWATR is looking really BAD! CRASHING!
why the sudden drop??
Bought 10 shares at 48.96. I wanted to add an extra zero. But I didn’t. Lol ￼￼
Zacks dropped their rating from 3 (hold) down to 4 (sell).The Starmine rating is all the way down to 0.3 out of 10.0.Look for a symbol change to TWATRQ soon?And there are those still pumping this free-falling wingless bird!
Louis navuller (s) has a great article on Twtr . Says it’s getting stronger and has buy recommendation. Igree.
14% haircut and it's still one of the most overvalued stocks out there in the teslasphere.
"Oh No!! CRASHED thru $49.20!! New Post ""earnings"" LOW!!"
Dorsey must go.
"Dorsey is covering for Biden, Twitter should stay out of politics or else the section 230 protection will be removed and Twitter will be sued by millions"
$52 taken out!! Total Breakdown!!
Twitter launching another nice new feature today. They keep this @#$# up and they could turn this ship. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-makes-easier-share-part-170015725.html
$52's Incoming!
"The beard, I get it! Dorsey’s trying to emulate Lenin."
"Twitter has chosen to slice away a huge chunk of their customer base.But unlike currently out of favor pandemic distressed companies, TWTR will never see favor again. They've chopped off an appendage that won't grow back.Maybe this is what they want. Maybe they want to be a small player. A small player with a 100% like-minded clientele in a zero controversy echo chamber.I don't know, but for a publicly traded company, that is arguably criminal.Not sure what tomorrow brings for TWTR, but the future is dismal."
If this busts through 70 before earnings...look out below
33.50 today at closing?
QAnon members are here... they are still ban in FB and TWTR... LOL
LOL
Why is anyone selling at a discount when reputed the negative report. I would rather believe management then financial reporters.
"Protest location for Twitter headquarters. 1355 Market St suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103 Do not break windows or burn down building please. Peaceful.. Kamala Harris has not donated to any bail fund for this event.."

SNAP beat. FB beat. Twitter on Friday? Easily beats as well. $45+ soon.
"""Twitter's main issue over the years has been the lack of monetization. This is expected to change over the next couple of quarters with the addition of some new features. Twitter Revue, for example, gives its members a way to build and share an easy-to-use newsletter. Twitter Spaces is a clubhouse type of feature that enables users to talk about any topic and engage with one another. Twitter is also working on Super Follows, tipping, and Twitter Communities. It is worth mentioning that these features will be deployed over a long period, so don't expect a new Twitter overnight.""from MF article, May 01, 2021"
twtr down to 25
What did Pump and Dump Cathy Wood do?? Did she do anything to turn TWTR into a different company?? No?? Its still the same JUNK that Crashed after Earnings because its a JOKE?? Oh ok..
"Bought at 52.85. I will buy more if it falls. Call me a conservative sell-out. I don't care. This isn't about politics, it's about profits. And Twitter is a good value right now."
"You know, I’m sick of all these hearings. Nothing ever comes from them. Any company that is under investigation should be prevented from any campaign contributions until they are cleared. That would help."
"SDNY and MC meeting for the 8th time, that isn't good for the Former Guy"
"I don’t understand why twitter stock price also dances with the concern of china trade war. Twitter is banned in china. The china trade war will strike china hard, but not USA and the rest of the world (except china related stocks)."
Wow TWATR got DESTROYED
"signed up for parler via playstore, cancelled twitter acct.....sweet. no censorship....libertarian heaven."
"$40 stock...very, very soon."
I cancelled Twitter because they are not focused on shareholder value. Their new mission is political cancel culture. I’m out.
"seriously melting down, any bottom in sight?"
BWAHHHHHHH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!!
This is only down 50 cents year to date. So much selling left to be done.
"TWTR should be $40 after the outstanding 1st Q earning report. Because of a conservative estimation from Jack, it pulled down the stock to $30. I truly believe that the 2nd Q earning will be excellent, which should send the stock to a price around $45."

"Isn't a company supposed to make money, or am I missing something?"
"After growing revenue by 24% this quarter to $711 million and generating $79.6 million of operating income, the company has now posted positive revenue growth and positive operating margins for four consecutive quarters."
"it's going to take a while, but the recover has started"
Twitter is considered a superior investment over Facebook. According to Guggenheim.
Just closed Amazon.. Flipped them the bird for their censorship..
This is a communist site owned by China.
There is no reason for Twitter is going down today with FB...Should be go up since user from fb comes to use Twitter
Back to 40
"Short-term double, long-term 20 bagger."

Own it and don't trade it. You will missed another massive run up in a few days.
i am looking to buy about 300 calls today that expires Jan 2019Any suggestions on strike and targets?
Nothing political but I hate the product because of bots and the use of unrelated hashtags just for view and hate the stock.
"The minority of Americans has been doing cancel culture for years, the patriots are flexing their muscles and down those companies are going. Twitter is done! You woke up the sleeping giant."
I just deactivated my Twitter account and deleted the app from my phone like many others here. I just don’t like the thought that they have the power to deactivate and ban me if they so wish. I tend not to hang out where I’m not welcomed unless I relinquish control of my basic rights as a human being. I don’t own this stock and never will.

"By the way . . . I shorted TWTR as soon as I heard that downgrade for FB and the other one . . . have since covered near today's low. Long term, TWTR - doubtless - will be bought out at a 40% premium."
Great work Boys!!
Twitter new logo has the bird holding a bag
"Jack, great quarter, keep the good work...."
Wow nvda dropped $21 bucks a share today. I know that’s a little salty for people here. You’re arguing over a $60/share stock so I guess that’s sort of the indicator. Ya know (people poor here)
"Let’s see what happens.Thumbs up, not guilty Thumbs down, guilty"
Why jack has to fight the most powerful man n the universe with 75 millions followers. Twtr should not be the perfect repository of the truth which can be argued and even debatable. The truth is there is no absolute truth and Twtr should not act as the chief arbiter of the truth. Put caveats or counter points but not to censor. Freedom of speech of questionable truth should be the motto of all social media.

So when do all the TWTR lawsuits begin?
Looks like systemic racism on a social media platform?
$40 by end of week.
Told you all time and time again to get out of this stock for the past months after Jack Dorsey shut down President Trump's account and James wood and many other conservatives. Over 8 millions of conservatives left Twitter including myself. This stock is going back to $45.
So Joe Hiden threatened to run over a reporter for asking a question? Was his account Banned yet? Time to impeach that communist immediately. Goodbye free press!

8:50am. $55.60. Was 56.30 two hours ago. Will be in fifty threes later today. Fade ME!!!!

Multiple analyst out now with upgrades of TWTR today.
Haha. Najarian got whiosawed on calls. Now he is in 56.50 puts. After a 15 dollar fall. Think I am gonna my to go long this #$%$
Wonderful Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is thinking seriously about restarting construction on the southern border wall to 'finish some gaps'. It must be truly painful to utter those words to staff.

"147,767,123 shares traded today circa $40 that represent 21% of the float. Lots of funds got in at its highest price. a lot of sellers capitalized on their low purchase price. Hopefully, there will be few profit takers and stock resumes its accumulation and moves toward $100 in few years"
Looking at the trend should hit 45+ if earnings pops. Then the high 30s are low point moving forward vs high point as they have been.
Buckle Up! Our Big Beautiful Bird is about to Take Flight! Beautiful Blue Skies Ahead:)
Twitter misses always lead to red for days and days and days. This is going EXACTLY as planned. Keep it up sellers!! You are selling for AMERICA.

"Ouch, down once again. The trend would suggest that it drops to $45 by June."
My opinion: todays merger of Fox and Disney will make Twitter even more valuable
This is great! Sold at 68. Bought March puts!
"so many negative posts on here about Twitter....for those haters probably buying a bearish...too bad the market smarter than that..almost 300 millions bought Twitter last few days for a good reason..if you don't like TWitter, you can leave.."
Just 1st day after earning announced. Great job. Will see more tomorrow
"Now that we’re back to $45, it’s $46, then$47 so heading in right direction."
Will fall more after Jan 20th when there is no reason to be on this platform. Lights out
"They freakin beat earnings by $.10, this makes NO sense, regardless of projections, which will continue to go up!"
Weak Volume. Sellers waiting to Dump. EOM.
"There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull, but BTCis going nuclear. A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of lifeThat being said, the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I’ll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of Prof Jared program, a pro trader who runs a training program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more bitcoin, with his program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. You can reach him on reach him on telegram @jaredtrade,let’s make the best of whatever we can"
Trumps just getting started. TWATR is DONE.

Dorsey does not care about his activist consequences to shareholders.
We will go back to $80 in the next few months 
Yeah after 8 straight Crash days Im going to buy a gap on Disaster jobs report and news that TWATR will let people tip their favorite porn people. When is the sexchat feature coming??
Prediction for tomorrow?
Technically Stock has came out of it’s Moving Average Channel along with positive crossover in MACD and RSI is also given positive sign.We might see a Good Swing move towards 75$-77$ with support of 68$.
it ll makes sense now... Jack's diet is restricting nutrients to his brain.
twtr will be profitable... fb and twtr don't go hand and hand
Bad news coming for Twitter afterhours today. Dump before it's too late.
"This thing is “rat poison squared”. In terms of value: zero. If you have a business that is largely based on a political bias, and censure specific people that inhibit your bias, you truly are disgusting."
sweet... I'm buying!
RSI can flatten to zero and crawl that bottom for some stocks as they crash non-stop.

Get ready for class action law suits. It is going to get ugly. Now the board needs to protect the share holders. Will the board replace the current CEO?
"The New York-based hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer has increased its stake in Twitter by more than $200 million and continues to buy after the sell-off began Friday, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Elliott disclosed a stake in Twitter last year, though it’s not clear how big it currently is."
How long will Dorsey’s jurk off investors keep pumping money into this disaster?
"Those interesting in trading, not necessarily $TWTR as a company to buy and invest in:- If the closing price is @ the low for the day (or a headfake next to it), look for a string of down days- Make money up or down, it's your money, it is not a religion- Aside: The Golden Globes was not good for $TWTR, unfortunate for the brand"
"Based on previous experience, upgrade from analysts are coming in next few days"
Back to $60 next week
Down with sympathy with Face Book. I think people are changing their social network to Twitter
Twitter is down just before the social media conference ... surprise surprise ...
They will report very positive earnings today after the hours then It is going to fly.
The numbers are not credible.. N A Z I propaganda..
twtr will be 50 before fb becomes 200
"$PINS is a Gem. it is in same league as $TWTR and $FB Pinterest is a brand. whomever, sold it short, will have to buy black. it is inevitable. Before you invest, set time horizon. You must have income from somewhere else. if one buys great companies not great stocks, one will do very well. $PINS is a great company. its stock is broken due to negative hypes. Buy now, when everyone is panicking. Buy stocks as you buy groceries on sale, in supermarkets."
I’m sure we will hear from the peanut gallery tomorrow about where they went long or covered there short positions only after twtr reports. It’s so easy to sound smart after the market reacts to earnings.
I did a 1 day chart overlay of $PINS and $TWTR (feel free). They are veritable copies of each other today.Not sure why they are so linked at the hip except social media ... thoughts?
On its way to 20 and below!!!!!
Reading all these political bearish comments makes me realize some of you forget the number one lesson in trading. Remove your emotions or you will get squeezed
I hope Jack Dorsey go BROKE! He deserves it
Revenues 2020GOOG = 185 BILLION FB = 86 BILLION TWTR = 5 billionJack don’t know jack about making money.
Wow Day 9 of Crash and still no support!!

great management. solid balance sheet. growing revenues and earnings. user growth.$50+ by earnings.
1am PST - Very initial opening of Pre Market trading there is further price increase. I’m just going to hope that is a good sign. Still praying.
Now is the time to buy...
Keep buying please
"Bargain basement shopping right now. Market is down as a whole. Those who are looking to get in. Take advantage of the discount. Twitter is everywhere, and with earnings continuing to grow, and with some housekeeping going on to clean-up bogus user accounts, and with allocating more funds towards development, I believe this beautiful blue bird soon will be soaring."
buy and hold through earnings if you want to become rich behind your wildest dreams.....

"Here's why I am bearish on Twitter.... It ran up like 40ish% in like the last 3 months. (too far too fast). So Twitter use was up big because of the elections... people were involved and using Twitter for their info and news source, that ran the stock price up, I get it. When twitter reported the increase in users, everyone assumed that increase would be permanent.... Then they banned President Trump.... then they started kicking off (permanent suspensions) a ton of conservatives! Twitter got super boring with those big name conservatives gone... I've noticed it myself... I mean BORING. Conservatives are jumping ship in big numbers to GAB. When Twitter went all out with there bans and censoring, everyone started jumping to Parler, but then amazon who hosted Parlers servers shut them down. Everyone jumped to GAB. Gab is a GREAT platform that does not censor. People are finding all their old twitter favorites on GAB now. Conservatives love GAB & don't really care to go back to Parler & will never go back to Twitter. Twitter shot itself in the foot by banning and censoring 50% of it's users. What were they thinking?? And they are still banning on a daily basis. Everyone knows one day they will wake up and find themselves kicked off of twitter so they are establishing their Gab accounts. Honestly, GAB is a better looking more user friendly site than twitter and they don't limit the characters/ words you can use in a post. I know this post jumps around but I'm on my way out the door so don't have time to proof read. In short, Twitter is going to go down because President Trump and other big names have been kicked off, the elections are over so people are spending their time elsewhere, conservatives are jumping to GAB in great numbers because all their favorites are there, because they know their twitter days are numbered before they get banned... and many are also leaving in protest to Twitter. I left and haven't looked back! Twitter is headed down big time.... maybe even back to the 30's."
"convertibles can very dilutive, I would tread carefully going forward. Between the dilution and people migrating to platforms that encourage open and free speech, its only a matter of time before we get a correction to a realistic valuation."
Just deactivated my twitter account.
I haven't sold a penny from my average short at $76. Now I am really going to buy a third house maybe in Montana this time.
Buy TWATR if you support Communism and Losing money
"To both liberal and conservative leaning individuals:""Pause and take a moment to reflect on the January 6th 'INSURRECTION'. Not a single firearms was brought by hundreds of thousands of people, with a good percentage being firearm owners and NRA members, to the Capitol. Would the demons (media, lying politicians, FBI) leading you astray? No need to argue, just think about the messages you have been 'told' and what logic tells you. What, it was the worst insurrection from a armed population EVER in THE HISTORY OF MANKIND or was it a FALSE FLAG event?"""

"HAPPY FRY-DAY!!!As the weather, inflation, and interest rates heat up and the narrow user base cools down ... it is likely to be a BLISTERING SUMMER for long-in-the-tooth 15+ year-old poorly managed Tech company.Remember: When you give folk stuff for free, it becomes an entitlement and expected. Trying to charge for it later is foolhardy."
"There is only so long the markets can ignore reality:""At 744,000, initial jobless claims remained well above the high of 665,000 new claims filed at the worst point of the Great Recession in March 2009."""
"When the Thai cave escape happened, I was glued to Twitter for real-time news from Thailand and around the world. On Facebook, all I saw were the same evergreen political rants from my Facebook filter bubble that I always see. Twitter connects the world. Facebook connects small groups of like-minded people trapped in echo chamber filter bubbles."
Red baby!!!!! Lots of stocks are up pre market. This is not. And for good reason!
"Jobless claims up, inflation up, Treasury yields up ... indexes still near all-time highs. Anyone remember 2000???"
"If Amazon wants to go into public internet market, twitter is the one. For Amazon it will be peanuts to buy it any day without a hiccup given such a small market cap. Amazon can benefit greatly by having a direct reach to billions globally. I am short on everything except Twitter."

"How Twitter Gets To $55Jun. 10, 2019 11:29 AM ET | About: Twitter, Inc. (TWTR), Includes: BABA, FB, GOOG, GOOGL, NFLX, SNAPStone Fox Capital Stone Fox CapitalLong/short equity, growth at reasonable price, research analyst, Deep ValueStone Fox Capital(19,470 followers)SummaryLoop Capital initiated Twitter with a price target of $55.The big target was hidden amongst a large upgrade of tech stocks.Twitter could reach the target via pushing DAU growth up to 20% and further improving monetization.After tech stocks got beaten down in May, Loop Capital upgraded the sector with some surprisingly large price targets. The most notable target price was slapped on Twitter (TWTR), implying the highest stock price since shortly after the IPO back in 2013. The price target implies a hefty gain, but the social-media stock has a clear path to reach this goal."
Where are sellers still coming from?
Waiting for stock to backslide to $25.Bought more GM today on dip.
"“There’s so many real-life problems that we’re facing, this is the last thing we all need,” Nomani said of the district’s effort to revise the controversial topics policy.Yeah, who needs to teach kids we’re all equal."
It could drop by 30% tomorrow. Poor guy!!!!!!
No legitimate resistance until $50
"Next week or...tomorrow 35,,,options expiring"
And the future will bring ...
This is overdone. Earnings report was not great but it was not horrible. I expect it to base out and touch $60 again within the year.
"you want to make a quick 15% on your money on twitter. Bye here, below 70. it's going to run up the beginning of the week, on anticipated earnings beat.will run to low 70's. then cover the call. short term at $75. ish. you'll take in $3-4 dollars."
Who would buy this????Not even groupthink libs. This is never hitting $60 AGAIN!
"KAMALA,!!! KAMALA!!! Where are you? When she made a run for president there is a reason she ended up on the bottom of the pack. Good grief...she could be president some day."
"No biggy, days like this are part of investing in a company like Twitter . If you can’t handle days like this, it’s best to sell and stay away. I hope it goes even lower so I can to my position . I plan on holding on to Twitter for decades"
"Please go over 36, please"
I'll go long on this when it's trading for 30c in the OTC markets...
"TWTR is not participating in the stocks rally of tech companies. I do hope it is being manipulated to be stagnant so it can be acquired by GOOG, FB or DIS. I hope Jack Dorsey will initiate this."
how does twitter lose money on a lockdownthere nothing else to do but go on twitter
"Here are some basic facts about why TWTR might be a good play right now: (1) average analyst rating of 2.8 is above the hold of 3, (2) 40 analysts voted with a average price target of $34.36 which is 15% potential gain from today’s close, (3) there has been 518M shares changed hands since the earnings release triggered drop, which is about 67% of the total number of shares of 776M.

Over 4 million shares bought by insiders over the past year.

Remember you deserve all the money from short...... this cover and let them rally it and then reshort!
How low will this go today?
Posting that trunpsalad committed libel in AZ and that we should tweet about it is not allowed. Fascinating.
Feeling better about this investment today lol
"Since reaching its 52 week high on December 18th, the stock is now down 18.4%. Wonder why????????????????????????????????"
Interesting business strategy to tell half your user base they’re not allowed to say what they think on your “free speech” platform.Let’s see how this pays off for investors.
Why TWTR heading down today?
On Monday Twitter -20%
"Ouch, 15% down today. Monday should see another 12% drop. This mess was caused 100% by the CEO. If the stock continues to drop, then the board will need to take action before shareholders take legal action. In addition the Trump media empire will arrive around July 2021. This disaster only gets worse. Can it be fixed? It will be up to the board to make the necessary changes including new leadership."
"All good hear, 50 by tomorrow, sorry meant 30.50"
$40 is may target for this month.
Twitter is down 7.30% to 61.88
"How is your regular unleaded gas price doing today? Wonder how a 75% increase is hitting all those Uber and Lyft drivers trying to make a living?Oh, while I remember, check out the new ""Kids as Prey Spur U.S. Outrage, Bid to Cut Social Media’s Shield"" Bloomberg article posted to $TWTR Yahoo! news. They know, Jack, everyone knows."
801 institutions own shares of TWTR. Vangard top holder
Twitter is working on a camera-first feature that could threaten Snaphttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/twitter-working-on-snap-discover-competitor-with-location-based-snaps.html
"Deplatform twitter. You don't have to put up with it, just leave and look for alternatives. Stop using anti-freedom oppressive apps."
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx
I don't usually like to see stocks going down but in this case I'm hoping this goes down to zero. GLTA
this stock would do so good but jack has the wrong friends...
I hope this goes to $10 or less.
Buyer strike against TWATRcoms
I'm done with Twitter. Refuse to support companies that deal in censorship. Good luck longs!
34 next week
"CDC Announcement, Vaccinated Persons in the United States:5,800 Fully Vaccinated Americans have contracted COVID-19. Just under 400 required hospitalization and 74 have died."

"Hey lib tards, RUSSIA DID IT! THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TWATTER DROPPING SOON TO BE 25%!"
Everyone needs to sell and close their accounts if they want them to be held accountable. Sell all your shares and short it into the 20’s.
can someone explain this in layman's terms? Seems lie the overall market and this has cased us to sink.Twitter stock pulls back from record after the pricing of $1.25 billion in convertible debt. Why does a company do this? to raise money. I'm clueless .. sorry. Please no political b.s.. just trying to understand
That headfake to $55 scared me. Thanks the lord we are coming back down. God bless America.
When companies like Yahoo and Twitter bury the truth then they are left only with lies￼. Continue to delete the truth
"There should be a class action suit against CNN. John Sullivan left activist was with Jade Sacker of CNN inside the Capitol before the rioters and he is on tape encouraging them to riot. As they come through the front door she says on videotape we did it. No you, we did and gives him a hug. Who knew about the plot to spark the riot. That led to Twitter blaming the President and removing his account, which set off a fire storm of Big Tech and free speech leading to the incredible drop in this stock. This is a huge story about CNN involvement."
Cathie Wood says that Twitter tipping is going to make everyone wealthy. She thinks the twatterer's that can spew the most is really good for Twitter's monetization. This problem of the $Billion losses is temporary.
"Citron calls to sell Twitter..... by Tweeting, the ultimate irony and oxymoron move. IMO they purposely praised twitter 2 months ago, knowing that they wanted to strategically ""bash it"" within 60 days... childish games, but if they can make money doing it , good for them. Going to $50 to $60 soon regardless of what Citron says... social media will likely be more regulated, as far as what data is taken and stored... but twitter is not directly on the chopping block for any specific incidents, Facebook is! Although this is annoying, I am slightly grateful to Citron for allowing me to continue to BUY MORE :-)"
TWTR going under would be a plus for the USA.
$19M volume already.
"What did you learn from the briefing...?*1,000 yard stare* ""A lot....."""
Where's brenda with her daily chart update? I'm sitting on pins and needles....
"Are there any Governments/Political parties, Pump and Dump Funds or Companies that dont have Bot Armies on TWATR??"
Under $50 Now!! Total Collapse!! SELL!!
Ouch! Down 2% again today. Just how low will Twitterleedy drop in 2021?
"Hmmmm, get out today or wait until Monday and watch it drop another $4?"
Twitter volume was at 65% average volume. A really good day needs to show 50 Million.
I believe the 45 level is coming soon.
revs and earnings both up with huge NFL contract in place... Everyone looks there for news first... Co made all the right moves at the expense of the short time players ..
Almost 2.3million volume in pre-market already...this is vicious...
"CFO-""What do you want to do with Twitter today jack?""Jack- ""let's drive this pig into the ground and then go score some H!""CFO...."" sooooo? Just another Monday then??"""
Stand by for REDDDDDDDDDDDD
i just register 20 new twitter accounts to support decline in users. It will bounce back up to 45 at least
Dorsey is feeling HERO to use TWTR and save the world. TWTR will be up 20% conservative estimate if Dorsey is fired by the sleepy BOD of TWTR.
Hey JD do you miss me now?
By all means move on to Crazy Ex-President's new platform. And sink your dough into the IPO. Let the grownups and common sense investors make real money while you own the libs.
Yesterday Fraud Fauchi was proven by Jim Jordan to be the epic fraud he is. I'm sure Fauchi & Mengele have much in common. Wouldn't trust Fauchi to clean a fish tank or shave pets for surgery.
$PINS --> $TWTR --> Coming to a theatre tomorrow?
"With strong international growth and upcoming more features to the platform, user base will only continue to grow..

On our way to $40 after ER.

"How are the 300 Twitter employees feeling this morning , you know the ones the newspapers said wrote a letter to Jack Dorsey demanding he shut the account down . Ancient history gave us The original 300, the ancient SPARTAN warriors of Greece who held off an invading army , modern history gives us 300 keyboard warriors who tanked their own company."
Just checking if my $40 order is filled yet. Might have to wait until tomorrow or early next week. I hope not.
How many quarters of earnings beats before this stock reflects its consistent success? I'm asking for a friend.
So many Twitter bag holders now haha  suckers!!!it’s going down selllllllllll
Wouldn't it be funny if Joe raised the capital gains taxes? Screw those rich people.

Keep. That. Fade. Coming.
"This will be Twitter's year, patience and persistence will be rewarded...I'm predicting 60 by end of year!"
Twitter will be over $41 today. New products and buyout announcements will gap it to over $50 a share. Nothing but good things are happening for Twitter.
"“Freedom of speech is a principal pillar of a free government: When this support is taken away, the constitution of a free society is dissolved”-Benjamin Franklin"
Just like Rush used to say “Liberalism destroys everything it touches”. RIP Rush!
Material Event has happened. Twitter could be a in violation of SEC laws unless it files an 8K detailing massive USER loss.
"FINALLY I'M OUT OF THIS....Bought 10,000 Shares @ 54.20 Over A Month AGO..SOLD @ 54.455. Made $2,500. FINALLY !"
"7+ years since going public. Still in same position.Current analysts targets below the present share price.And shareholders tolerate a part time destructive CEO, that has cashed out the majority of his holdings long ago.His wealth is tied up in his full time CEO duties with $SQ Square seems to be doing quite well where Jack Dorsey’s wealth is and TWTR shareholders continue to get bent over.Take your frustrations out on SQ. Hit deranged Jack where it hurts."
Remember to cover your shorts! This company is so unprofitable it has never paid one dividend! But the retail traders love it!
I hope TWTR goes to zero
Governments around the world will BAN TWTR soon
Back to $36 in no time?
"Sold. Win or lose, principles are important. This stock deserves to tank."
Twitter down with new social media site launching soon...TRUMPER
"Not a single one of my Stalker Troupe nor any of the fluffy followers of the Turnip were able to answer the simple verifiable fact and the following question: Why did the Turnip wait ten weeks before advising his fluffy followers to take the phony fake hoax vaccine for the phony fake hoax virus?

I don’t know much but sold ostk roku and bought TWTR and XNET. Both getting momentum
Bought 100 more @ $36.96
Have you lost your mind why would you by Twitter Twitter manipulated the election ban people blocked￼ people restricted people Twitter only gonna get worse I would not touch Twitter with a 10 foot pole￼ they are corrupt Face Book wasn’t as bad everybody I know has deleted Twitter from other accounts Twitter is going much lower￼
What did I say a few months ago “twitter will make many of us millionaires “ bink
Chuck when dorsey opens his mouth again.
"Jack Dorsey, can do everything but earn a realprofit. He should step down from any managementrole at TWTR. Why not just have some guts and goto a subscription model.? Jack should ask Warren Buffet fortutoring sessions."
"Dorsey has been a bitcoin advocate for a while, and he plans to integrate the most popular cryptocurrency into Twitter and Square. If this news pops Twitter will fly above 70++++++in few weeks"
"Big Tech TWTR, APPLE, FB, AMAZON, GOOGLE banded together to squash out a tiny company, Parler because it's not doing what they are doing! Do people understand this?"
TWATR censoring truisms from the Israeli  Hamas  scuffle? Say it ain’t so Bob.
You guys are bashing Twitter when the dodge father use it to tell you what he’s supporting.
"What a crazy day. This showed that MM are in control. If google announced great earning, Twitter will soar tomorrow. If not, we have to wait until Wednesday morning."
Pretty grim looking chart lately
Trash company. This is what happens when you censor people based on your own political views.
Wow if MSFT Tanked on earnings just imagine how bad it could be for money losing porn vendor TWTR and its declining users!
People are bailing on Twitter and going to Gab who says they are adding 1 million users a day and are the fastest growing site in history
Collapse? Bankrupt?
Oh you mean there’s consequences for banning the rightful POTUS?!
Time to buy several days ago when blood was in water. Still cheap here
"This just in: twitter to rename itself ""planning and praise app for antifa""."
"Guess who is covering NFL Thursday Night Football  this year? That’s right, TWTR! More and more new users..."
"This is beginning of the end, just imagine the day that Parler goes online. Freedom of speech is not negotiable."
Great day to short while the stock is up.
Hello long. I wish a bloodbath everyday for this stock until $0
Twitter everywhere on my TV ... even on the groceries we purchase...go twitter stay strong my friends cheers 
52 week high on the way!! What a great price
Clicking every advertisement I see on Twitter
Fifty three seventy three and red with Nasdaq on fire 
It’s a battle to make a penny - green today ?
twtr is used for news types. Wait and see what happens when we get closer to election 2020. This will be back on top and explode. Remember this is Lord Cheetohs only form of communication to the masses. haha
"You were warned by Powell look for ""significant losses"""
"almost 2million shares trade on the trendline breakout. if twtr holds, and gains on more volume, next week should be epic! glta... bulls."
Needs to start filling the gap up to $44. Next week should good.
A lot of people will or have cancelled their Twitter account; just as a lot of people decided to not invest in $TWTR any longer - sell any stock and don't invest in an ETF or a Mutual Fund that contains it. Both will impact the share price. Lot's of other places to invest and make $.
just covered my short position
Where is Twitter and all other social media on the Colonial Pipeline hack? It was funded by a liberal group and it is all due to propaganda on how bad oil is to our environment. Even TSLA harms our environment making EV. Just look at the carbon that enters out atmosphere when Lithium is mined and how much of it is needed for each EV. Imagine how much more harm it will do when those batteries are discarded. EV is no better than fossil fuels - it is another problem and more long lasting. Twitter is a total joke.
wait till they have to report that first quarter with 90 million less subscribers. No amount of propping up by China is going to help that. Jack better start selling some more tweets. 2 months and running since I cancelled Twitter. it's a great feeling to know that you are not contributing to Communism and censorship
Bought 30.95
"GOOD Evening to ALL.........was NICE to see this thang turn down and RED , the good color . AS we get GREAT NEWS out of Ga .........the AUDITS Kicking up and going to show ""THeSTEAL"".........ALL that the REAL POTUS said , will come true......and all will KNOW it soon.....While this CPAPPY commie rag , dissolves as we watch....."
"Ouch, down once again. The CEO caused this mess and now the Board needs to act!"
You would have to give me TWTR shares for free and pay me to keep them in my account
Twitter may become obsolete within the 2020s due to censorship and ineffective advertising. It’s also reasonable to believe they make a lot of money under the table from organizations who want to manipulate the public. Hard to create a bullish thesis for this stock
Police find no clear motive in shooting allegedly carried out by former NFL player Phillip Adams? They did not consider it may be related to racism. Another example of how reports are intentionally misleading people from knowing the truth.
woke world can go wake up in another country ——- you’re not going to change our way of life and history in this country. ￼
half will be leaving. my opinion
TWTR engages in politic turned off users. They should focus on their business delivering better users growth rate.
"Don't forget that while Twitter was declaring a loss of over $7 Million in QE2 2020, they were busy handing $10 Million away to BLM. The SEC should drag them over the coals just for tha, because basically by handing away the shareholders money, drove the company into making a loss."
"88M will leave TWIT, and head to DT platform....leaving the TDS inflicted to chat amongst themselves...they can buy FowChee's new book, "" I was a MSM lapdog. waffles anyone?"""
Hi - buy twitter - it's an easy win
added 200 more
The World Cup could be a big earner for twitter.. hope to see this translate into great revenue..
My shrinking twitter gains are great self reminder not to buy garbage companies in the future.
"With Katie Wood investing in Twitter along with Goldman Sachs and the Vanguard Group, it would be no surprise that we take Twitter past $100 in the future"
Below $60 soon
Friday $41-$42
"Jack Dorsey didn't expect his stock value to decline. He has 76% of shares held by Institutions, they must be concerned. Mark Zuckerbergk has sold $650M of his FB shares in the past few months. And Tim Cook CEO of Apple just gave an interview. He never does interviews. It looks like they are all trying to do damage control. If these shares keep dropping, don't be surprised by possible management changes."
I bought in $46. There better be good news on the 24th.
"Twtr in March 25, $60Twtr today’s 67For Bill who is maths impaired, that’s 12% in 9 trading days and all Puts incinerated."

The Beautiful Bird Is Still Looking For a Place To Land! I'm Thinking Some Where Between $52 and $54! If The Market Does Something Really Bad I Could See The $40's! Tweet Tweet Baby;)
Mr jack said 2018 is the year of twitter now people are going to pay for not believing. Iam a long term investor. I will hold strong  . Excited today.
I hear Amazon is looking at Twitter. Anyone knows anything?
Laughable that Twitter wants to remain “consistent” when that’s that farthest thing it’s ever been. Hope every single holder of this stock burns.
"Hey guys I’m a newbie, it’s too late to get in Twitter now? And what you all think of Twitter price target?"
painful
"Looking great today. Looks as if we’re heading to $48 everyone’s been talking about,"
Stock not even worth $5 shorts  coming out hot 
"It could hit $80/share by 2042? Buy now, what a great investment!"
I lost alot of money listening to brenda. don't make the same mistake I did
"Buying on anticipation begins this afternoon, and continues tomorrow.Look for a strong afternoon"
Easily breaks $50 by the end of the week.
"So right wingers are squawking non-stop about censorship and hamburgers and masks and who knows what else. Sounds like MAGA (make America great again) was a failure. Like, an unmitigated disaster. A flop, a washout, a lead balloon and a Big Fat L for the home team."
"Did you hear what Twitter (TWTR) said at the Citi Tech Conference yesterday? Oh my, I enjoyed that. The key is, my take, they think mDAU (Monetizable Daily Active Usage) growth can continue to accelerate. If so, this stock has much higher to go. New multi-year highs on the way."
"The real news is red pens and blue pens. Twitter isn’t going anywhere, frankly speaking"
This stock is going to the Moon after earnings call. By the way it feels like some of the mods on this board are deleting liberal posts and keeping Trumpets happy (maybe they are braindead as well?). Hehehe.
Releasing the NY Post from purgatory isn't nearly enough. Damage is done. People see how this company is run and what they are about in terms of culture. Bias and suppression of information is a PR nightmare. I expect user numbers to continue to disappoint in Q4. I'm sure advertisers are watching closely.
Here’s hoping Elliot Management is the next Archegos and buys it’s self into oblivion. They do the exact opposite of what a good Hedge fund does by broadcasting and flaunting their purchases. 
Anyone know anything about Flordia passing a bill banning big tech over 100k *PER DAY* they keep politicians banned from their platforms? If its true 
"Nasdaq down 2.55%. Throw your MAGA caps in the air and party like its 1959, Trumpsters!"
"The game is over. TWTR will keep moving UP as the CFO said in the 3Q conference "" the direction has been set, only thing left is execution"". Jack's both companies ""TWTR"" and ""SQ"" are flying. This stock has so much potential, however I still believe that it will be bought at a price around $40 next year."
This is performing incredibly strong today considering overall market. As a hater who wishes to see this go to zero I am not happy. 
"Ouch, down again!"
should be closed at $47 up
"China red, Twitter and Bidens favorite color."

"So when a company that has negative earnings creates a situation that produces negative growth and incites protests against the constitutional rights.... the buy point is what???? Out of business. Bankruptcy. I have cancelled my membership and sold all social media stocks I held.... some at a small loss, but much greater than zero. I also expect to see peaceful protests at these companies and the senior leadership soon"
Wow TWTR dropped over 20%. This Junk is in its own Bear Market
This is simple like always. Wall street works the other way around. Google exceeds profits. Everyone expects everything to go up and as always it is not like that. So today is the day of buying twitter at low prices. And of course it will increase the profit day or the day after earnings. It is what he always does.
"That is always the pattern , after a steep drop like yesterday selling continues about 2 to 3 days . Normally 5th to 6th day is when it stabilizes & some sort of rebound starts, Just hope that the indexs r also up at that point else zilch.."
Giving Twitter an upgrade and a buy signal is like giving the Roseanne cast an Emmy after they removed the star...
When you prefer bots and ban real users lmao
"Like it when Twit loses value, bad days ahead for the China Media Group..aka, Twitter, facebook..."
it's green.
This will eventually see $30 again. I’m so happy!
Down on sympathy? Nothing to do with internet sales tax!
Should I set take profit on 50 or 40? Lol
Another down day. The company will gradually fade away. Only users are Liberals and who cares what they think.
Stephanie Link and others expressed their high satisfaction on CNBC based on Twitter’s earnings (and guidance) and are expecting a big SP bump in 2020.
It's reached the point that calling things 'conspiracy theories' are just convenient dismissals the left-use to dismiss uncomfortable truths. The truth is more shocking now than any conspiracy theory out there...
"I don't totally see what the big deal about twitter is. It hasn't had very good growth, user-ship is declining, and revenue growth isn't very impressive given the fact it rarely turns a profit. It's kind of just ""there"" but not really creating value. Idk it feels kind of like a zombie company."
About 3 weeks ago we were all laughing when NVDA dropped from 618 to 465. Oh it’s back to 615. So I guess you need to

Today the stock will be under $50 with no end in sight. This stock is bleeding every day. Must be agonizing to see your net worth dropping like a rock.
N A Z I' S run TWITTER!!
Any predictions for today.$34?
"The price recovered today to close at the ma(20). Anytime a quality stock like TWTR pulls back 5%+, that is a buy, buy, buy."
"I agree withy the article posted in Yahoo.. But I still think Salesforce, MSFT, Google, will buy TWTR.."
"Silver Lake is an American private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout and growth capital investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries. My thesis going forward is in the next 1-3 years Twitter will be sold. First they have a lot of work to do with adding value to the company. It's down with the broad market. All this market volatility will subside and you will look back and see a missed buying opportunity. I'm long twtr and would buy more here but I'm out of dry powder."
$35 before you know it
just bought 150k worth around 53.50. it's very oversold.
I was a buyer today. There's money to be made long term here. No troll with baseless bashing can convince me otherwise.
Question: What will the less than impressive habitual Twitter users identify as this week?Answer: A door #$%$
I bet $TWTR is LIT-UP with the Yemeni men apprehended at our southern border on the terrorist watch list?
Can somebody please lay out instructions to delete user accounts to ensure user would never be miscounted again for this commie stock.
I think this stock is way undervalued.
"I wish I could short this stock. I don't have a margin account. However, I am glad I don't owe any shares in this sinking ship.... Only a commy with no morals would own shares in this company"
Wake me at $100. This stock is cheap and is dominating the social media platform now..
FADE TO OPEN IN EFFECT. ALREADY DOWN 80 cents vs an hour ago. Keep chasing libs!!!!
i might buy at 53 again
"@realDonaldTrump used to me my favorite source for election lies. Thanks to Twitter's communistic censorship, I'm not being gaslit and manipulated nearly enough."
TWTR is going to CRASH!!
"The Fed (aka 'Foreign owned non-US bank, Rothschild) can not print enough money to keep these pigs afloat. Add 1.9T costing each tax payer $5,800 while receiving $1,400 benefit (remind anyone of SSA?), and inflation, dollar devaluation and interest rate rise are going to accelerate.Look for a major market correction if not recession. WHY HASN'T THE NEW ADMINISTRATION SAID A WORD ABOUT TAX INCREASED TO PAY FOR NEWLY PRINTED MONEY? OMG, this could get VERY UGLY."
Thanks Joe we love energy dependence.
"The Bob Iger comments are interesting for sure. His comments reveal that Disney’s interest in an acquisition of Twitter was very real at the time. He ultimately decided against buying Twitter. However, since then, Twitter has made major improvements on their platform. I am no longer in favor of a buyout. I think Twitter is now standing well on its own."
Bought more today and happy I did. 
Based on the rumors that Google may buy out Twitter. I am placing my sell order out there at $50.50. I have it pegged for after hours trading as well since this kind of news comes out before and after the trading day. I believe that it would be around 50 ish. That number just makes sense. That would be a nice profit without being greedy or unrealistic.Let me know what you guys think of that standing order.
I like the move. Should help TWTR become more trusted than FB or Insta. I think both sides would agree that letting political speech spread naturally in a social network is better than pay for play ads.
No one really needs twitter or facebook.....you may have a happier life by actually getting back to life without social media.
Watch the blocks of buys folks. These are not retail buyers. Big blocks for the past 3 hours. This is a really good indications that the price is right for institutions to buy in.
After the earning It is going to explode like rocket and going to hit $80 plus easily.
"Dorsey tweeted the beginning of his weekly review on line with his staff live by mistake on May 12. Check out his tweet. He caught it but gave some insight into the fact the BOD is closely monitoring what he's doing. He has to report to the board status every two weeks. This is very positive and shows Elliott and Silver Lake are making an impact by being on the BOD. He's been CEO for 5 years, moves way too slow and the stock is down while FB hits all time highs. Time for a new full time CEO! TWTR goes to $75! Should already be there. Vote out the entrenched BOD candidates at the annual meeting next week."
Ban Twitter from your portfolio.
FX Empire - Twitter Could Sell Off Into The 40's.Heh-heh. Told you more-ons.
Make your bets....Red or Green at close?
Close your shorts until it is not too late :)
After the hours earnings report today It is going to fly like rocket and going to hit at least $80 plus easily.
"What a week for A-merica re-regaining a RESPECTED status in the world after the ""O Man Bad"" departure:- Putin sends a throw down at 2%Joe- China blasts Blinken for 20 min (in their 2 min open)- Kim Jong Un says there is no way on earth he will talk to anyone in the administration""You get what you pay for"" as they say ... lots of positives to #$%$ about. Don't forget the non-crisis at the border!"
Someone tried like heck to prop $TWTR up at close. Tomorrow will be fun day to watch!
FB money going to Twitter
"This stock is still 100's of dollars behind what it should be in price per share based on similarly popular media and social media outlets. I sold a fraction of holdings out of frustration about 2 months ago at $37 (on covered calls sold for $1 with $36 strike). It has not touched my sale price since. This thing has hurt to watch on its slow motion price up....and hurt me the one time I sold some. Congrats to those with the patience to hold it as it seemed to stand still for 5 years, while there had been so many gains to have elsewhere."
"VP Harris claiming ""climate change"" is the cause of the border crisis, while children are getting thrown over the border wall onto their heads by the cartel."
Blue bird not going anywhere till the ref bird gets released 
"Its hard to imagine that TWTR would miss the 4th Q earning because of the same reason given in 3nd Q. The bug has been fixed and business is in normal, of cause the stock price should go back to $40."
Communist Social Media like Twitter have signed their own Death Warrants. It might not happen overnight but the Movement has started.
Wow its looking like this Junk is starting to TANK all over again!! Seeya in the $40s!!
"Tech: 1.9T printed. New bond offerings and taxes. Yields have been rising and will rise even more rapidly now. Cyclical rotation. $TWTR and other techs that do not make (make = Apple) or sell (sell = Amazon) will be put under increased downward pressure.Long $TWTR affected, this is separate from their business model. Good luck all!"
"Jack Dorsey: "". . . And now, dear shareholders, let me present the good news: I may shave soon !"""
It’s brewing for a pop to 58 by EOD!!!
Seller are gone buyers coming in
$TWTR will be going to the social media reunions with MySpace in a few months.
"Goldman Sachs increases price target to 40.00Twitter (TWTR): Increased Confidence in Profitabillity, PT To $40 - Goldman Sachs"
TWATR wants users to Pay to undo their tweets HAHAHA
Not a shareholder here but am a SWKS holder. Exact same action happened with SWKS. Didn’t just go down gradually but dropped all at once before the ER was out.
I Have Followed TWTR For Over 4 Years! It Broke Support This Past Week! I Could See $20's In The Near Future! They Have Been Talking About Having A Subscription Service And Pay For Purchases Using Your TWTR Account For Almost A Year! Now They Are Saying It Could Be Another Year! Always Sometime In The Future! I Cheered For TWTR For Many Years! I Have To Say I Am Very Disappointed And Have Given Up On This Beautiful Bird! Good Luck To Anyone Still Holding!

Stuck in the mid $50's. Hope you sold it already . This company has lost billions.
"I just checked the volume chart on the day graph. There is a lot of nothingness in terms of volume this afternoon ... less difficult to swing the trades that fill at Ask. Congrats to $TWTR, it may be an even or positive day. No tail for low at close so next week is a toss-up."
This is what happens when you condone this censorship based solely on your own beliefs. You can’t silence everyone you don’t agree with and think you won’t get backlash. R.I.P. Twitter. Dorsey already looks like a homeless person. I can’t imagine what this will do to him.
"IMO, Heading to $45.and then some. Keep banning Conservatives. LMAO."
Ignore the hyperbole on this board. I dislike what Twitter did to conservatives as much as everyone else on here.But they had a good (not great) quarter. And this is almost at a solid buy zone.
TWTR is worth less than zero
Closing my FB. Twitter Amazon and whatZapp not worth it to be affiliated to a follower of CCP My Amazon credit card as well will close close for good

jack Dorsey is going to announce mandatory vaccines for all twtr users and this will fly to $100... Its for your safety
This is just the beginning Take it down to 5 buck Chuck..
Ouch! Down again around 2%. Now this is getting serious. The board needs to act and soon before there is a shareholder revolt!
"The recent upgrade TWTR from BAML shows the evidence of the growing popularity of Twitter. The best thing for Twitter is that it has replaced FB to take the lead in SM companies, and it will stay this way for a while. There is a high probability that more analysts could upgrade TWTR as BAML did before releasing the 4 Q earning and the price for TWTR should be around $35 to $40 by Feb 7th."
I would leave Twitter and sell my stock but I am not own Twitter stock and I do not Tweet.

The rollover is in play. There are many attractive investment options. Why would anyone stay here unless you're on the short side? Is it a TDS hangover symptom?
It odd that the trading volume is not high on the dip today. My entry point for this stock is 16.00 dollars. I had sell 185 shares when the market tanked in December. The climb of these stock is endless.

"Twitter can't go bankrupt, soon enough for me."
Twatter could go down $10 a share soon because very bad news is coming out
A whistleblower inside Twitter recorded CEO Jack Dorsey and sent Project Veritas the recording.
Twitter will become an option an most tvs and start to eat into Netflix cap. Very undervalued for its potential and working with Disney this will be a fun month for longs to prosper!!!!

"Where are the pumpers?? Kind of a dull one sided place here, like twtr..."
"Jack should have an obligation to investors to be honest and transparent and admit that he only likes liberals, which is 1,000% true. Then, he should focus on keeping his liberal user base and when he loses 30%-40% of his users which is already in the works, he can charge his liberal base a small amount each year to become profitable, say $25/year. He will then immediately realize that his liberal base will never actually pay for the things they want/use. Then, Twitter will be gone in a few months vs. it dragging out over a few years. Then Jack can focus 100% of his time exploring new drugs and changing/polishing his nose rings. Best case scernaio for everyone."
Gonna be a big day tomorrow
Dorsey effect...
"Unavailable on Twitter. From the Epoch Times’ article: “The whistleblower—who says his or her background is with the Venezuelan military, including the national security guard detail of the Venezuelan president—outlines an alleged conspiracy between Smartmatic software executives, former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, and that country’s election officials, to ensure Chavez won reelections and retained power for years. The whistleblower said he was present at multiple meetings.The Epoch Times was not able to independently verify the claims.“I was witness to the creation and operation of a sophisticated electronic voting system that permitted the leaders of the Venezuelan government to manipulate the tabulation of votes for national and local elections and select the winner of those elections in order to gain and maintain their power,” the affidavit states.“From that point on, Chavez never lost any election. In fact, he was able to ensure wins for himself, his party, Congress persons and mayors from townships.”The whistleblower claimed the “software and fundamental design of the electronic electoral system and software of Dominion and other election tabulating companies relies upon software that is a descendant of the Smartmatic Electoral Management System.”"
"Since I do not use THE TWATR, question for THE TWATR aficionados: Is there a MARKETPLACE for used VIRTUE SIGNALING cards?When I first bought mine, I let ALL my FRIENDS and even ACQUAINTANCES as well as PEOPLE I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN KNOW I had made this great and wonderful purchase. I was met with ambivalence and antipathy (A&A).Then I tried to use it to show my support for teachers unions over the education of students. Again, I got mostly A&A. Worried the card was defective, and not to be deterred, I made a third attempt by flashing the card as I went for the first time to a BLM rally. Again, A&A.So here I sit with a card that just doesn't seem to work but I am unsure. I have seen MANY OTHERS with similar cards not appear to work but they display them VERY PROUDLY, they prize their card like a 2021 Kentucky Derby winner. Can someone help me get the most for my card on THE TWATR?"
Too much bearishness on this board. That's why I bought at 52.8 and will buy more if goes below that. I am a conservative. I love America. But I also want to make some money in the market. And twitter's quarter wasn't THAT bad.
Drop from $73.44 to 49s in just the padt month. Yes! I hope you shorts make a killing shorting this company. You know why. Censorship.
"you all should really view the Bloomberg video with MKM's Jim Strugger...very nice.Even for those of you who may not be involved in options contracts, listen to what the man is saying. Lots of catalysts going on to move the stock price higher short term especially with World Cup going on. Once the pps breaks through the $37 dollar level, from technical charting, there's little resistance to $50, really nothing holding it back. That's my take, but each of you longs should take a listen for yourselves. Additionally, those CNBC Fast Money guys were reiterating on Friday that there is a very large amount of calls compared to small amount of puts open interest. That kind of call buying means big financial firms and other institutional monies are positioning themselves for more upward movement in twitter pps from here. These firms are not likely to lose and I'm sure they have done their homework and all the right connections. We are all little retail fish, including myself, but we can use our brains to recognize the strong undercurrents and to use those observations to our advantage! Best wishes this week!"
"When America falls, historians will look to the role of the MSM and social media companies. Mussolini once described fascism as actually being corporatism. People who invest in companies like Twitters are investing in their own self-destruction. Once America goes, your bank accounts wont mean a thing."
"FB is getting 5% pop on a massive beat, imo for TWTR a miss or even a moderate beat will continue the down trend as relative performance will be seen as weaker than peers. Looks like the slide is picking up its pace, we will see what 4:00 brings...stay tuned."

Going to Crash
TWTR has lot of potentials... accumulate...once the platform is reformed to be efficient and versatile should reap the benefits. I project that TWTR will be much higher by year end!
America chose democracy over trumpism or should we call it marxism?
LOL Demcoms werent so confident when it was this low on Day 9 of the Crash
"It’s almost like turning a profit is a bad thing in this business. Maybe if Twitter booked billion dollar losses like Snapchat and Pinterest its stock would go up? Anyways, I’m long and will use any dip as an opportunity to buy more."
men don’t have periods either. God made them that way. hmmmm will i get cancelled for stating facts?
Say helloooo to today’s new lows. And the market is rolling. Glorious.
"by looking at today's chart, it seems that trading bots broke and didn't know what to do. That's not humans trading...."

35 is the level we need to break. Big gap up over 40 with short covering soon.
"Twitter buying clubhouse , going into e-commerce , Bitcoin , NFT .. ."
Facebook and Twitter have lost a combined $51 billion in market cap following their bans of President
very strong buy before the earning today.
"Hi TWTR, what is different between you and the Chinese State-Owned Media?"
Nancy Pelosi husband invested 10 million in Microsoft and then they were awarded a 22 billion government contract. Insider trading? Oh she gets in on IPOs also. I'll celebrate when she retires.
Does anyone know how much Jack Dorsey willing to sell Twitter for? I hope somewhere around $45 to $50.
"Communists think free speech they do not agree with should be banned. If it is hurtful, it should be banned. If it makes someone feel bad, it should be banned. If it is counter to the media narrative, it should be banned. If THEY consider it a lie, it should be banned (in that case, shouldn't every member of Congress be banned?).The word LIBERTY is a completely foreign concept.

"Surprised it hasn't fallen further. There's a huge exodus away from the both Twitter and Facebook occurring at the moment, judging by the numbers deluging alt tech sites.

Just a reminder to everyone that Twitter is yet another MONEY LOSING BUSINESS in this gigantic massive stock market bubble
"The same pattern holds, flaccid pump attempt in premarket, then back to red. Didn’t manage even 1% green today."
"We are getting down to a level where TWTR becomes an attractive take over candidate. There are many companies that could easily buy it .... Google , FB , MSFT , AAPL or even VZ or T . The bottom line is they have 7b in cash and they now generate significant cash flow . I’m loading the boat . GL !"
What a great opportunity. Now I can pay for the privilage of being censored and banned
I’m thinking $30 before the carnage is over
7 years of no growth.....forget the bans.....this stock has had no growth in seven years. Just look at the chart....60s in the IPO days in 2013 and 51 now. Not one dividend in those years either. Don't worry the retail investor will keep over paying for this!
"Politics and Finance and Dislike of Longs v Shorts Aside:Ask yourself, FY20 + Q4 earnings were out only 16 days ago including company calls, FY21 Q1 earnings (negative) estimate, etc.; now this presser today.

TWTR Did Great for the Nasdaq to have been negative 120 today!!! Our Beautiful Blue Bird is Going to Soar like an EAGLE!!!
Any suggestion on how Jack can increase user growth? It seems like that’s what worrying the streets. Even with consistent profits for the past few quarters they’re worry that there’s no one to monetize on in the future
Twtr acquires another fake news website to build on its existing one
Anybody who bought the share of this fascist terrorist racist liberal propaganda tool and help to fight against free speech deserve to lose all his money.
GREAT NEWS for Facebook & Twitter --->Early Voter Turnout is Beyond Expectation in Washington State !!!So far 72% of registered Republicans and 311% of registered Democrats have voted.

twtr is going up to $52.25
Looks like conservative states are getting together on sensorship. Congressman from Florida said to ban big tech. I
"Barney Rubble from the Flintstones with his Water Buffalo' Hat on with his American Flag and Spear, some call him King Neptune. That representation is not about what occurred on January 6th, that was just part of the piled on Circus side show's. The reasons why TWTR stock will plunge is also really separate from the events of January 6th. The reason why TWTR stock will fall, is about Social Media's actions relating to Freedom of Speech. You'd have to go back to Paul Revere and the Lanterns to understand that! TWTR has Violated the first Amendment and for that the Free World their is a price to pay. The U.S.A Citizens saw this type of control in China and Russia the suppression of free speech for years,. Our Free Capital Markets will surly send a message to not only TWTR, but to Facebbook, Google and others. In that group for many months to come will be product boycotts of advertisers as Products on those sights. There are 65 to 80 million Americans and maybe more who understand the Freedom of Speech and no change in administration is going to allow that to occur."
Dorsey On Joe Rogan Podcast tonight. Goodluck
"words are actually a bad way to convey your message, since people take words out of context so much. Better to talk via video."
The Exodus of big Tech. GAB is running slow because of a million new users a day. Telegram just broke 500 million users. IF conservatives can't win a rigged Election they can win through power of the purse and choosing platforms who believe in free speech
Patience my friends.....
Who is already excited for DAY 5 of the bleed out tomorrow. I love this and I’m not making a dollar on this. God bless America.
Mini-DCB ... meow.
Trumps not coming back even if you beg him on your knees
Watch for HUGE RALLY TODAY!! Hedge funds loading up!!
Twtr finally holding gains ... its a miracle!
TWATR has been such a wonderful stock being down massively after 7 years of pain and suffering that its gapping up on news that its image cropping algorithm is racist and sexist #PumpandDump
Investing in Twitter isn't good for your finances. Good thing I predicted this would happen.
down goes the thought police
Blood red! Like the soon to be streets filled with liberal blood!
I deleted my Twitter account.
Dont worry its only money. Jack will send you all a participation trophy for banning the realprez and destroying this JOKE of a company!!
"So a company which CANNOT MAKE A PROFIT and lost money in 2020, while handing away $10 Million of shareholders money to BLM, is priced this high? You're kidding me. Twitter = Enron."
"So we are pretending to forget the Disaster Jobs Report,Gas Shortage,Border Crisis ,Middle East on fire etc. etc.etc. ?? Somehow I dont see this ending well. Timberr"
Buyout coming soon. Make the bid. No need to wait anymore.
So proud to hate this company.
"Anyone who owns TWTR or is considering buying should reflect on what they have become. We so many instances where they ban people for only having a differing viewpoint whereas others who can brag about not paying their taxes, fleeing from a government search and arrest warrant, athletes who baselessly whitewash an entire race of people who have done excellent work for charities as racists, it all shows the lack of positive leadership a company should have and the employees who are promoting this type of behavior to promote negative subculture factions in any country. This platform of propaganda and control must end and it prevents me from ever considering buy this stock. TWTR must evolve into a better company that is promoting all social media without bias. They are a shallow company with little objectivity."
"Since Facebook and Twitter want to cut off any other competition to their monopoly and censorship of media, I say dump them both and just call and talk to someone on your phone. Yea, it's old fashion but you actually get to hear the other person and they get to hear your voice. This censorship thing has gone too far. Last I looked this was still America. At this rate we won't have to worry about China or Russia for interference for meddling in our lives!"
"I just read that the NY Post has instructed it's journalists to not use CNN, MSNBC, WaPro and NYT as primary sources. This is very good. I think there will be more to follow their lead. Basically, the NY Post is censoring CNN, ,MSNBC, etc. as primary sources. YES!!!!!"
Splat!
potus is determined to keep the unwashed from actually working for a living and contributing something instead of sitting on their butts and watching tv all day....
"Ah, the echo chamber of reverberating, unchallenged, endless woke nonsense. $30 soon."
"This baby is will hit $40. There is no need for a buyout. The fact that it hit 35 after the earnings, it's a clear signal that the bad news is behind us. Does this remind us with Facebook , It does !"
I heard about TWTR the other day on (http://Pick-stocks.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

d this story. And TWTR does not care?Mama June discusses million-dollar drug habit in first sit-down interview since rehabIt is ok fto protect Hollywood from their drug and inhumane abuses toward others while they censor anyone that does not agree with their CEO?
the whole buy and tech is sector is take a little dip. tine will take this to 100+ time is on our side and the ball is in our hands now
I’m out. 40s next week. Can’t believe twitter longs think censorship and manipulation will end well
"Jumpin Jimmy Jordan fanning the flames of discord by trying to get his white base upset with immigration. Trump showed that this is an issue that can really animate Republicans. Like Trump, he's giving the base someone to blame for their failures in life - immigrants. Today's Republican Party."

Maybe Dorsey can hear now. First amendment support is burning this anti American company down. Boycott Twitter.
Purchased additional 3000 shares today at $35.65Earning report and guidance will be amazing +$10 at least .
I wouldn't buy this company stock if it was $5 a share
"Seeing Dorsey's networth drop like the heavy turd he is, is priceless."
"I think it's time to buy some TWTR. It's been sliding down for a month now. I believe it's about at it's bottom, and it should begin to head back up very soon. This should be back up in the $60's soon in my opinion. Good luck all!"
"glad TWTR favors ""election transparency"". Support expanded early voting and proving you are eligible to vote. Electioneering was already banned where I vote, so free water can't be used as influence. Glad we all agree on ""election integrity""."
"With Twitters support of anything liberal, they have allowed majority in both executive and legislative branch. We can thank them for loss of free speech and $1.9 trillion spending that will cause inflation this country has never seen before.￼"
Prediction: $52.69. Actual: $53.55 Diff: $0.86 --> Maybe tomorrow.Very large support at $52.40. As it approaches ... fun times.
"Yesterday, Iran officially announced 2 cases (and subsequently deaths) from corona....on Twitter. Today they have announced 9 total deaths...on Twitter. Iranian citizens posted videos of the start of a military action to surround the city of Qom and close all roads....posted on Twitter. Shortly after, there ceased to be civilian internet transmission from Qom. I post this to show how important Twitter now is in global media. I also post, as I am getting more nervous about this virus, and its likely major impacts on the world. Stay informed - use Twitter (it is a great source, but must be read with healthy degree of skepticism). And, yes, global business wand markets are due for a big hit. This is not SARS or Ebola; it is different this time."
Twitter is the same as the media and puts out false narratives and censors “free speech” just sold 50k shares thanks for the profit

"All: Ignore the race conflagration brought to you by the DNC and MSM. There are not African-American, European-American, South-American-American races, there is only the human race.Focus on what they are attempting to distract you from: Maricopa County, John Durham, Governor Manslaughter/Murder in Nursing homes, Border Crisis, Hyper Inflation beginning, etc..This tired game has long since been retired. Identify RACE BAITERS, call them out!"
Twitter pretty much deserves this plunge.An utterly evil company attracting utterly evil people.
Put in my buy order......at $20
TWTR up 4.5% is smooth sailing for the year.
I caution TWTR holders to not put stop losses on your gains! Don't let Mr. Market steal your shares for the funds trying to pick up shares. They will dip this thing 10% or more on several occasions to get shares. Hang on for the ride to 125 and don't a big capital gains bill this year.
It on the way back to green just like yesterday
"Idaho internet provider now blocking TWTR at cistomers request—prevents children from accessing via in-home routers. Dorsey, too many drugs causes bad things to happen."

Twitter's immunity will be ending soon. This is goign down big MOnday.
The entire 675M share float has turned over since June 13 or so. Should be good support here moving up.
Vanguard liquidating
I just checked and found that twitter was the fourth most popular app in the apple app store. Something is happening!!!
"Twitter, the bird that couldnt fly"
If Jack Dorsey sells his first TWTR I'll sell too.
It’s not just me. No human alive named Jason Miller is a good person. It’s just true. Think about it. You knew a Jason Miller. And..
Is it at 10 yet?
"Dan Ives on CNBC ""TWTR is in the top 3 candidates for an acquisition target and believes it can can to high $30's, low $40's organically"". Hold your shares!!!"
I like the French Webb site prediction of over $100 for Twtr.
Hedge funds exiting leaving all retail trades holding the bag.
Real reason for twitters success was the following Trump had and it brought millions of users who otherwise wouldn’t be on Twitter or care to use Twitter. Not a good day and probably worse to come for this company
"Green in a sea of red, strong buy signal."
"Twitter's stock surges toward 5 1/2-year high in wake of social-media rival Snap's blowout resultsAlso, There are 1000’s of stocks to choose from and this 1 free service helps you narrow it down and select the best one. Just go to (http://tradenow.xyz)"
Sure would be a nice Father's Day bonus next week to know that Twitter climbed another few bucks on all this momentum! That's what I'm hoping for! Good luck this week folks!
"resistance at 32.50, if it closes above that, 33.50 in sight"

Sorry guys the the emotions are running sold my initial investment and letting the profits ride.. I’m disappointed in myself but I rather sit on the sidelines of the overall market for now.. if it keeps going down I’ll prob jump back in with that initial investment but I need to book the win here.. to all my longs I hope you understand I believe in the stock and I know these day to days are not what represents this stock.. I just can’t go to the hospital again ROFLMAOOOO!! I shall be back! Gl my children!!
No room in this world for twatter with RealPrezDJT taking over social media! Even the Demcoms will be going to his New Site!!
$35 by the end of the day
At the risk of being called a LeBron James. Yahoo? you're next.
Need down to 20
Not surprised at all
I will not make a single dollar on Twitter’s meltdown in the coming days and weeks. But it will give me more satisfaction than any dollar I have ever made in the market. Karma is real. God bless America.
The dynamic Hungarian is done propping it up.
shorting at 45
Here is a leak about the FBI... I used to work at a private satellite image processing buisiness whose software was mostly used by natural resource and intelligence agencies and academics. One week a year the image processing buisiness had an annual open house where we invite all users to a week long conference to talk about new features and discuss everything image processing related. Coincidently the conference occured two weeks after the Waco Texas siege. During the conference two users from an unidentified agency told us that the FBI put in a request to use incendiary rounds at Waco.
Still $50 over value. $8 sounds about rite 
Someone’s 32.13 short is about to go underwater
Feels like FB is losing it's mojo and TWTR is gaining it back. Regret not buying shares in the high 20s during market pullback in April. I wouldn't be surprised to see TWTR be a $100 stock in 12-18 months from now.
"After hours down $1.25, evidently in reaction to Facebook,s after hour drop. Evidently JP Morgan has different opinion, Friday will be the test."
If it drops to $10/share then I am in big time! MAGA
Why would you sell when they deleted bot accounts. That’s a daily maintenance and it’s a good thing.
Say thank you to your president
"In 6 months, Twitter will have more lawyers on staff than programmers. Legal fees fighting the endless pockets of states and fed are just the beginning. Losing liability immunity will bankrupt the company. Twitter will have to fact check every post prior to making public, or not post it. This will be a slow bleed. But, Dorsey has square to count on at least. Too bad for the bag holders that bought in to this company"
Twitter investors are ANTI AMERICAN..
Back to 25 where Twitter true value is now tech hype is deflating
LOL...this ticker is like a countdown!!! Love it...
"if you don't conform to what $FB or TWTR want you to say, you will be banned... The Democratic party is no longer the great JFK Democratic party... sad days ahead for freedom of speech. Capitulate, or lose your freedom of speech."
"Whomever doesn't think Treasury yields and inflation are soon to take a step up, let me know. That gaggle of noted economists could be wrong in the way they are looking at printing 1.9T more $$$ adding to the national debt, treasury issuing more bonds to cover ... and zero announced new taxes.Help me there, if we can just print money, why can't we just print money to cover our taxes? Note: Said with a hint of sarcasm knowing the Federal Reserve is a private bank and our taxes go to pay the shareholders ..."
It was a joke to make the price around 70s. This is $10 stock

"Ouch! I predicted the market - and Capitol Hill - would be kinder to Jack. In my view, FB is the real target. I have my theories as to why Zuckerberg is public enemy number one to them. But, regardless of any explanation, that's the way I see it."
"Twitter selling its stake in the democrat party might help this stock go up, but as of today, they are still entrenched so far and so deep, that the whole Silicon Valley smells like an enima in progress."
Get ready for inflation recession higher taxes and $5.00 a gallon gasoline....
"All Republican sell your stock. This stock will loose 50% of it users. Sell, or loose your future. Government will recently switch parties. Will face it after next election. Sell now or later at a lower price."
Here is another excellent example of how TWTR romotes liars who are on the liberal side or democratic side of politics:Elizabeth Warren: 'There's a real issue' with environmental impact of bitcoin.This clam is unfounded and show cannot support her interview with any analysis she compiled. Another example of how she continues to lie and falsify facts through the misuse of her political office. Where is Twitter on this side of the discussion? Why does Twitter allow certain politicians to lie and censor others? I will never own Twitter stock - they seem to be a a function of propaganda media.
"Day 4 of the bleed out. And the market is green. As I hoped and prayed for, this illiberal company’s fall will not end any time soon"

"2021 Q4 - Average monetizable DAU (mDAU) grew 27% year over year to 192 million, DRIVEN BY GLOBAL CONVERSATION ... watch the report on mDAU % growth and comparison to estimate.Demographic update - 40% of Twitter users (US) are between the age of 18 and 29 years (Omnicore, 2021). This represents a hard narrowing of demographics unfortunately$TWTR is now the second to the bottom of number of users (343M) of the ranked social media entities. $FB has 2,740M as the top dog. The ONLY ONE $TWTR beats is Quora at 300M. Newer social media companies such as Telegram are already well north of 500M users. $SNAP and $PINS have 33% more current users. Source: https://financesonline.com/number-of-twitter-users/This could be a disaster in terms of current users, mDAU and demographics. Advertiser $$$ follow opportunity. Interesting."
Who's familiar with the term blood bath?

Mutual funds that hold Twitter will not be getting that monthly paycheck contribution. Long term Bearish
TWTR is going to hell for at least a couple of weeks.
"Well, well, looks like Twitter is full of lefty shills like Brooklyn dad being paid by the DNC to push radical leftwing agendas. All the more reason to dump this propaganda machine. Going to $30 soon."
Does anyone actually give a F about this company. If you can't make money with 200 million users (about 110 million fake profile bots) then you just suck.
not selling a single share 55 stock. just a bad time with the market we will get through it
I'll buy $TWTR if the price drops to $53.25
Might test 44
"Here's the deal folks: The futures are way up for the first trading day of the 2nd quarter, so watch the market closely today. If it holds and or builds on the opening gains then that is a very BULLISH sign for the near term, but if today's opening rally fizzles out and most of the gains are lost then a market correction is imminent. With the torrents of good earnings news and economic recovery data flowing in now for weeks, if that cannot propel this market upwards then that's the sign a correction is going to take place BEFORE the next market leg up.Don't say you weren't warned."
"3.1 million share buys. Looks like a buy-to-cover short at ASK, that is what it drove the price up temporarily."
Welcome to another day of Commie Red. Just because this is so predictable does not mean it is less enjoyable. Keep chasing libs. TWTR still up 90 percent YOY.
Twitter misses are AMAZING Theater and never let you down. My popcorn has been out for days.
This #$%$ banned the president but gives khumeini a platform...Hope it hits $8 by the end of the week

Everyone that got scared and sold their TWTR yesterday needs to learn to have Belief in Our Beautiful Blue Bird!!!!! This is Our TIME!!! Fly Birdie Fly!!!
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act needs to go . . Sue Twitter and crash it’s stock to zero as it censors and covers for Joe Biden and hides news on what is on Hunter Bidens laptops! The left can no longer let tech media force only one narrative down Americas throats. Sell TWTR get out of the stock .
My puts are looking fabulous today.

"i remember when this chat used to be so populated, now I can literally scroll through a week of comments in less than 1 minute :)"
Just think the tech companies that now monitor and control every aspect of American life were seeded w/ taxpayer money. Gotta luv it.
FB is up over 5% and SNAP is up 1.24% and Twitter is up 0.3%. Twitter will not go up unless Jack steps down. We need a full time CEO.
sell off tomorrow. 15% dip tomorrow. sell now
Should close over $45 today.
"Presidents gift to the American people: raised income taxes. new tax on every stock transaction coming, raised capital gains tax, taking the knee for Iran and help them get nuclear capability, turning over technology to China and ceding the South China Sea, attempting to take away guns from law abiding citizens, flooding the country with illegal aliens and allowing the infected, the diseased, the illiterate to come with the full monte of handouts. Hopefully they'll flood all the democratic cities and turn them into public toilets where they are free to defecate and urinate in front of businesses, homes, children and drive crime through the roof. Yeah, the gifts will keep on coming....."
A lot of super bullish articles. I like this stock. I think i have something here...haven't felt this way since i bought Nvidia at 90...that stock alone put me up over 100% for 2017...this year its Twitter
"FBN Securities raised its price target on Twitter, Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) to $40.00 (from $23.00) while maintaining a Outperform rating.Analyst Shebly Seyrafi comments ""We are happy to see TWTR post its first GAAP profitable ever as GAAP EPS came in at $.12 (vs. a loss of $.23 in the year ago quarter). The strong results put out by TWTR in FQ4 are consistent with our research which indicates that TWTR turned the corner recently. A key risk to consider is that there could be some nearterm fallout from the recent departure of Anthony Noto to SoFi (private). However, we believe that the company is enjoying strong momentum under leader Jack Dorsey (who is also doing a splendid job with Square [Unrated]), and we expect this momentum to continue."""
"Laughing at all the people saying Facebook is doing better. Go invest in Facebook then. When was the last time someone opened a new Facebook account? The site has become unusable. And then they bought Instagram and broke that too.Consistent user growth, that's what matters. Twitter grew before, during, and after the pandemic. They do one thing and do it well. It'll drop tomorrow sure, but look at the rest of the chart."
"Can anybody explain (nine thumbs down please and thank you, troupe) why the Turnip (aka the Mango Mussolini) and his wife took the vaccine for the phony fake hoax virus but didn't tell their fluffy flock about it for nearly ten weeks? Did it forget? Was it too busy golfing? Was it too busy haranguing the fluffy faithful to send generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago to assist with the financial upkeep? Look the the Southern District is just rocking along. You just knew that Alan Weiselberg had a lot to say when he had his little fireside chat with Robert Mueller in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Wonder what the faithful retainer Michael Cohen has to say? Maybe Matt Gaetz can be on the Turnip's legal team? Remember, the more thumbs down, the better. I collect them. Good boy."
Burn. Baby. Burn. And the Nasdaq is still GREEN.
"Twtr had a ‘floor to ceiling’ window of time to fundamentally change the news medium. However, without any adults in the room over there in management it is just uninvestable."
How many countries have Bot Armies on TWATR?? Do the Pump and Dump funds have Bot Armies too?? Are there any actual people left on TWATR??
"There is something severely off with Jack Dorsey. I feel bad for you if you throw your money away on his ideas, they are definitely not what the majority of people see as “healthy” or “prosperous”."
It will not take forever until a big and better: opinion free and social media will appear. When it happen Twitter will fade and die lik yahoo did after google has come.

"Hello all. I figured I would lay out why I'm a long-term bull on $PINS and why it is one of my favorite names within the social media advertising universe. First of all let's understand the value propositions for $PINS from both an advertiser and a user perspective: Starting with the users. Users love $PINS because it's simply a different type of platform. This isn't a platform where the most engagement (likes, comments, etc.) wins (like $TWTR or $FB). It's an inspiration engine of sorts. If you want to get ideas for a vacation, or how to redecorate your house you use $PINS. $PINS is like an inspiration search engine. The more you show $PINS about what you enjoy on the platform, the more they can curate specific content to you. The social aspect is the exchanging of inspiration. This leaves users with a sweet taste in their mouth after using the platform, whereas $FB and $TWTR users tend to be more bitter after using the app (think of the crazy political discourse on those apps). The stats back it up: 47% of $PINS users have an intent to purchase vs. mid to high teens on other platforms. This isn't a social media platform, it's social commerce.For advertisers: Users have high purchase intent, there is a lot of first party data that $PINS has on platform to better target and curate ads, and it doesn't have the PR backlash of advertising on $TWTR or $FB. Sure, you might not get the third party targeting, and the automated ad platform is still in the early innings, but the long-term value proposition for advertisers is there: 459 million people are looking for inspiration. Give it to them."

The target price increase every day
LMAO. I've predicted this one last week. I said 12% down last week (and it was close) and 10% this week with down after ER. I am really accurate!
This Was $80￼? 2 months ago?
New poll: nearly two-thirds of Americans (64%) are optimistic about the direction of the country. Seems like the tide turned in people's outlooks....just about 6 months ago.
"An officer also stated that Nazario was ""fixing to ride the lightning,"" in an apparent reference to execution by electrocution. This is going to cost taxpayers, MILLIONS. I’d like to hear from our resident worriers, hand wringers, boomers, on why our popo just can’t seem to follow their academy instruction? These errors, annually, amount to 700 million to 1 billion in payouts,many countless lost lives. Aggrieved communities take their revenge through the elections process and rioting. Having Roscoe and Enos on the streets was cute for a tv show, but you did know that Ben Jones is an admitted supremer type? Not just a good ole boy never meanin no harm."
"I’m sorry for people who lost money. That dosent make me happy. But don’t hold this stock, Twitter decided to self sabotage its self and now it will pay the price. This is just the beginning of the decline to $20. I’m not joking or trolling. This is the truth! Get out now!"
Tommrow 7.am or 4.00 pm please any body know what time
Record volume of 52.4 Million on an up day in a down court. Somethings got to be cooking.
going to $40 soon
"“A leaked recording of a top Twitter official suggests the company will have a ""global approach"" when it comes to tackling misinformation as critics in recent weeks have sounded the alarm on political censorship.”I’m sure the Europeans and others will love when they see this. The end is near TWTR."
"Up until last year, Joel Greenberg was a rising star in FL Republican politics. No further comment."
Wokeness doesn't pay. These people don't have jobs and just complain all day.
$40's by end of next week.
"""Where did everybody go?"" -jack"
Current Share Price vs. Consensus Share Price in 1 Year- Facebook -> Considerably under- Apple -> Considerably under- Google -> Considerably under- Snapchat -> Considerably under- Pinterest -> Considerably under$TWTR -> $2 over. Be careful out there.
Nothing builds confidence in a stock like the deadcat bounce from down 40% to down 30% after 7 years of Losing
which brokerage is the best one? anyone?
"Wait, Republicans aren't onboard with a 1/6 Commission.....don't they want to expose Antifa's role in masterminding it?"
"Elliot management, twitter insider and activist investor bought $200m more share priced at $54They are planning to add tip jar system, subscription system, marketplace system. Decide if they can easily double or even triple their revenue from these."
"For those who haven’t bought in yet, do so now TWTR is giving you one last chance at $43. Soon it’ll be $45, $46, $47, $50, etc."
Rasputin CEO gets what he deserves. Even yahoo doesn’t let me post this.
2 million shares in first 10 minutes. Wow
"Looks like yet another red day is shaping up for this junk company stock. Normal people don't want to pay $3.00 a month for the privilege of subjecting themselves to the rantings of a bunch of drones in an echo chamber filled with lunatics. Once the remaining accounts that were on the fence about leaving actually leave, the average daily user count drops by another 70% with a subsequent drop in the share price to follow."
Fry-Day Cometh ...
TWTR is now more of a take-over target than ever. I can see Google or MIcroSoft or another company buying Twitter...TWTR is here to stay...this is a great time to buy.
Have started shorting TWTR. Others feel free to join in. SQ needs to also be heavily shorted!
"CONFLICT: Fauci’s Daughter Is A Software Engineer At Twitter, A Company Which Suspends People For Disagreeing With Her Father."
"I am sensing the last 10 minutes of the market could be a race to which tech stock will win the lowest of the day award ... this has NOTHING to do with $TWTR, it is the increase in bond yields, Mr. Powell, folks staring at the 'web' less ..."
"Drop Twitter use Parler Twitter permanently suspended Loomer after she tweeted that Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress, was ""anti-Jewish"" and ""pro-Sharia."" Twitter said that Loomer, who had more than 260,000 followers on the site, was permanently banned for violating its rules against hateful conduct -- and not because of her political beliefs, as she had claimed. Facebook suspended Loomer from its platforms in 2019 for running afoul of its policy against ""dangerous individuals.""Loomer is just one of hundreds of thousands of people who've recently sought refuge with Parler, which calls itself a nonbiased, free speech-driven platform. Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas have been promoting the app since Twitter started applying labels to tweets by President Donald Trump that falsely claimed fraud with mail-in ballots or that the company said glorified violence. Trump's campaign has been considering ""building audiences"" on other social media platforms, including Parler, The Wall Street Journal reported last week."
Twitter Suspends Kayleigh McEnany’s Personal Account for Sharing Hunter Biden Emails
Buy at 27.00
Twtr has massive pricing power. It's goin much higher
49 tomorrow
I bought in at 66 and I’m losing! Do I hold and hold to make even at least?? I need honest advice please! I’ve lost money already 
Twitter will be RED again today haha. Twatter is an enemy commie arrogant self entitled company that needs to be brought to BK and then trashed along with every worthless person who works for them.Thanks.
Imagine being triggered by a social media platform and daring to call everyone else snowflakes Couldn't be me.
"I’ve had bad days. Even on my worst days I never went and got a Volodymyr Zhukovskyy haircut, searched out Asian women and took it out on them. I never loaded up my insta or gabber or fb stream and decide to hurt ladies or patrons because I get a little frustrated and can’t slam my bits hard enough. Definitely don’t need any Jay Baker types but HR is sure being tight lipped here:Cherokee County Communications Director Erika Neldner announced in a statement that she would be handling media inquiries related to Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office’s investigation into Tuesday’s slayings.The statement did not give details about the status of Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Jay Baker."
Buy buy buy with this discount. Twitter is not going anywhere. It’s everywhere.
To bad Tweeter banned 45 because they are in deep doo doo!
"Once there are more social media sites to open (Trunp's, etc) , expect TWTR's DAU and income from ads to drop. Ad budget/ expenses by companies are usually fixed per year and if they have to advertise also to these new sites, then that's eating TWTR's lunch. Twitter has no future and it will become obsolete in the next few years. FB, on the other hand, has a bright future as their businesses and monetization are different from sissy Twatter."
"Ha Ha! 1 Month, straight down!"
"Israel, Hamas, Colonial Pipeline, Border Insurgency, ANTIFA new wardrobe for blue city protests … don’t take your eyes off of Maricopa, there is always a reason the Deep State is distracting you "
Up .23 cents not bad compared to a lot if other stocks! Slow and stead wins the game
Twitter is full liberalsliberals= milking the government paychecks so not worth advertising to the bottom feeders who can't afford anything
"The dead cat bounce is over, Twitter stock will close negative again..."
Another day another dollar dropped
"Any logical, sane person remember when a terrible jobs report coupled with an increase in the unemployment rate would make markets fall precipitously?There is something terribly not right here. The pumping of money from the Fed we don't have paying people to refrain from paid work + inflation overhang + illogical markets + crazy spending packages = Pay the Piper"
"@markimark -- Have you read your Constitution lately? Hint: Nothing's changed over the weekend, so here's the scoop, skoopie: The First Amendment protects us against GOVERNMENT limits on our freedom of expression, but it doesn’t prevent a PRIVATE entity from setting its own rules. . . . You SNOWFLAKE COMMIE (trying to prevent capitalists from controlling their own destiny, without YOUR big government getting in the way!!)."
Wow Pumpers Pumping the Crash like its a win??
The biggest Chinese mouthpiece anti-American company. twitter
TWTR CRASHING AGAIN!!
I think I’ll add to my short from 72
Will two years probation for Derek Chauvin be enough to keep the natives happy and Minneapolis from being turned into one giant charcoal briquette?Short his junk stock to $8.00.
Acquisition announcement this week. TWTR is ripe for someone to acquire it at $40 a share which is very cheap.
no one should use the term “White Supremacist” its intent of use does not exclude all white people who are not racist. it divides and causes tensions between races. yahoo and twitter need to refrain it’s use or references on message boards... law suits are next.
I put in my buy order....at $40
"Personally if you read all the results about Twtr i find it hard to see the drop it did, 1) people saw FB and panicked 2) it was a political drive to sell the stock for the so called shadow banning and lies so all political allies banded together and drove it down. its nervous times but after the weekend and people going back and reviewing results it could be a swing positive as they will see how actually Twitter is financially better off than the panic on friday and pretty stable. they make there money on DAU not MAU so the MAU result really is not the driver in there results. just my thoughts here"
55..54..53..This looks familiar doesnt it??
This will close at +55 today with SQ blowing out earnings... they’re flow parabolically
"What is the problem?""Revenue of $711 million (543.16 million pounds), mostly from advertising and up 24 percent from last year, exceeded the average estimate of $696 million among analyst research aggregated by Thomson Reuters.""They are down 1MM users that is about 0.30% Everyone should be buying...."
"so many good news, after ER this stock is flying past 55 into 60. not selling a single share"
Downhill until they stop pushing a political agenda
"A great earnings report (2nd in a row), several upgrades, picked as the stock to watch in 2018, FB is soaring... and Twitter sells off. If this doesn't scream manipulation, I don't know what does. Twitter should be at $36 - $40 / share right now."
consolidating slowly but surely twitter up days are not far just hang on tight
Buying opportunity!!!
"Theres 3 guarantees in life - Death, Taxes and TWATR dropping like a Rock!!"

The censorship lead ballon is dragging Jack and his “book burners” down! Sell before it’s too late!
The day that Twitter silenced an American President was the day I sold every share I had. Twitter is disgusting.
Jack’s comment about strength in staying independent may have just put a higher premium on any buyout offers! Thank you Jack.
"Today free speech is under assault , has anyone listened to rap music recently....Talk about hate speech..."

Hahahah Shortes let Go Up

Looks like shareholders are taking out the trash.
Never seen so much hate and negativity on any Yahoo Board so far. Seems most poeple here using this board to vent their political frustrations. I say keyboard warriors at most.
Ouch! Twiddleedy is down once again. Head to $50 by April.
"Twitter Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is a mental condition in which a person has been driven effectively insane due to their dislike of Twitter, the social media company, to the point at which they will abandon all logic and reason. As TDS progresses, the afflicted lose the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality. To date there is no known cure, and family/friends are advised to humor the afflicted, who are typically of advancing age."
serves you right tweeter. your going down!

"Today if $TWTR finishes at or near it's low and tomorrow being a non-descript Friday, it could be very, very brutal. No one will want to hold over the weekend.Could it touch the 59s tomorrow at close?"
Dorsey’s recent appearance confirms it: we have woke hobbits running Twitter.
"Note: Inflation, once it starts, doesn't go away, it ALWAYS gets WORSE. Sure I am a LIAR, and to prove it, find a case where it has not gotten worse since starting and post the details here.SM companies stock price will suffer, no matter what pump is applied."

Congratulations To All My Friends Who Bought RKT Yesterday! When I Told You Too! Love You Guys;)
"Twitter is becoming an echo chamber where everyone thinks alike. It’s a bore. Many people deleted their accounts already. How are they going to attract more people? That’s what I’d look for DAU are everything. That’s what I want to see. Now we have another whammy that hit. iOS 14.5 from apple. If you are part of the cult let them know your every move. If you respect privacy, expect the advertising to take a hit like favebook will experience from this new Apple rollout of privacy. Apple has more money than most of these companies combined. Let the games begin. I’ll sit on the sidelines and watch."

"Today, the American Medical Association has announced that the strange and shockingly erratic behavior of Marjorie Taylor Green is not the result of any side-effect from any of the COVID-19 vaccinations against the phony fake hoax virus, but rather an immune response from the self-administration of hydroxychloroquine, Dennison-branded sodium hypochlorite mouthwash, her 12V rectally-inserted UV light and misuse of Alex Jones-branded anti-COVID toothpaste.Matt Gaetz should not be held responsible for his transgressions as they were instigated by the above factors. Rep. Gym Jones has nominated Matt Gaetz for Secretary of Child Services in light of his experience."
This will crash 15-20 percent tomorrow. Look at past twitter misses. This is glorious.
"Just saw a Bloomberg article that Twitter has inked a 3 yr deal to livestream MLS Major League Soccer matches along with Univision! Soccer is huge worldwide, and this is great news for Twitter! $40 here we come!!"
"A while back I saw an article trying to estimate the value of Trump to TWTR. This was 4 years ago when the stock was $15. They had Trump at $2 Billion. Add 4 years of growth because of Trump being President, and all the other conservative personalities (who were also deleted, it was NOT only Trump), and all their followers, and replies, retweets, and retweeted retweets, so on and so on. Then look at the profitability of the company, or rather the lack of it. This will very likely swing them to a loss, and if angry conservatives start boycotting advertisers, this could be extremely damaging. This isnt some spineless advertiser caving because of one or 2 angry liberals, this is half the country. While there may be damage tomorrow, the real damage will come over the next few quarters. Neither Trump, nor his 88.7 million followers are ever coming back. Ever. This is a permanent, self inflicted injury by someone with a fiduciary duty to protect shareholders. This will very likely be the largest shareholder lawsuit action history."

Maybe. Poor friend. Probably was playing with Kyle’s nuts which is why he bought him the gun. But he’s getting lots of nuts in jail so there’s that. But you’d think the vigilante Kyle’s would be in every Asia town on every street corner defending Asians. But nope."

What a great stock to short for sure.
"Dr shiva suing twitter for 1.2 billion already won two big decisions. He is proving twatter is an agent of the state, bye bye money and section two thirty."
"The mutt v-p thinks the borders crashers are victims. She thinks they all deserve full boat free health care, unlimited stays at the Hilton of their choice and keys to a new car. The left is demented. They think their best idea is legalizing public defecation and urination anywhere and anytime."
AI is being rolled out everywhere. Banks love AI already. It will replace all kinds of repititive jobs. Even at Mickey Dee's. It will be IBM Watson taking your order at the drive through. The burger will be made by machines inside. The only employee is the person who keeps it working. So more layoff's are coming. Covid-19 was the excuse to lay people off btw. Oh and I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI seen it all coming. It's here. Your jobs are gone.

2500 shares at 46.66 should I sell now? I am down like 50 between this and snap
"Sales force & google rumored to be interest in Twtr. That’s what we need , a bidding war ."
Ouch! Market is up but twiddledy is down another 2%. Maybe the cancel culture idea is being rejected by most Americans.
Been off Twitter for months and am much better for it . . .looking back I realize It added nothing positive in my life and that their are better ways to get actual factual information!
"Citron Reserach vs. JP morgen, who has more credit in terms of investment? Even people with no brain should be able to pick the right one."
A permanent suspension to a president regardless of political outlook is a bearish indicator.
i think 50 plus in 6 weeks.
"To all those concerned about the recent drop in share price for TWATR. Don't worry, it can get worse, a whole lot worse. Why do you think Jack issued that convertible bond thru secure channels to only his 'friend investors' at convertible common share prices WAY NORTH of where we are now or even $80??? Dirty deeds require payoffs."
How much are we loving the delicious irony that TWTR is worth more without “45” than with him?
TWTR annouced bad news for sales revenue so why was it up today? Should I sell ahead next reporting day? What do you people think out there?
"""The disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning. It gets in the lungs"""
is it good time to get in now at 39.88?
"Let this be a lesson kids, Communism doesnt pay"
"TWATR has announced they are going all in with a subscription model to save their business. I am remiss in finding anyone that wants to pay for content on TWATR. This is a last ditch effort to turn a 15+ year tech company around in the hopes of remaining relevant.Pay to follow someone? Pay for streaming stories from USA Today and The Atlantic? Pay for to follow a Porn Star?Sorry folks, this will end poorly."
Look at earnings estimates and think of all the recent and upcoming news events driving record-setting numbers to Twitter. They will absolutely blow the doors off estimates for the next two years and beyond.
I hope Twitter falls back to $20/ share before February 2021.
why people are going crazy about bo rumors when this stock has so much potential
"Despite all the bad times and bad news surrounding TWTR these days, I've always had a sixth sense of confidence in this stock. Albeit, I don't have a TWTR account, I do own a large number of shares purchased at 26. So I'm under quite a bit. But something in my gut tells me that I should ride the times and when this stock picks up, I will wonder why I ever doubted my investment. I feel convinced that we will see the best of this company in 2019 and beyond, so I'm willing to hold. Hope I'm right."
Just saw a Twitter ad video by McDonald on their new breakfast coinciding with the clock time change. Actually watched it. It had 4.6 million views. Or are McDonald bots running the views. Or are part of these views triggered from Facebook. Pretty significant number of views.
"Ok I'll admit something...Feds raided Giuliani's pad, and Twitter would be more interesting with the spectacle of another unhinged tweet from the mango moose. Still plenty of laughs to be had from an ""elegant"" press release (lol), but it just ain't the same as a semi-literate, bizarrely capitalized tweet."
Adding more this month.
"Yet they had all that blowviating higher guide a month ago, now this. What a crock"

Why TWTR when you've got Yahoo message boards.
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.

"Watch The social dilemma documentary, social media is ruining our lives and is diving us now more then ever. This incident is a perfect example. Boycott Twitter!"
Can one find any thoughtful commentary on Twatter any more? Has it now become a leftist echo chamber?
This just in. The Work Boot Emporium remained untouched in last nights rioting in Minneapolis. Imagine that.
OUCH! Twiddleeey down again. Just how low will it go?
Twitter is becoming the Mega New Site for World Leaders to reach mass population without any reporter adding their twist to the news. Easily Crossing 100 bucks.
"The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said in its reports that it found no evidence that Epstein received any special treatment due to bribery or influence by any member of the Palm Beach County sheriff's or state attorney offices between 2005, when the investigation launched, and 2009, when he was released from jail. Most probably don’t know the story of FBI agent David Farrall. Florida Department of Law Enforcement, snd the BsO also cleared him. Multiple times. Their officials actually testified that the black choir kids he killed were driving the wrong way. But then facts mattered. Cars were photographed, skid marks, cameras saw Farralls car go up the wrong ramp. Details details. So when the FDLE says something, they’re pronation lying, if they’re protecting their own. Dave Farrall is thankful. He served 90 days for their fiery murder. Same time frame too. Thanks FDLE."
Second time posting. I see they had a lot of fun in Portland again last night. Maybe Maxine can fly up there and praise them for being more confrontational. I bet this post will be gone in a nanosecond again.
TWTR in full glory today. Yesterday was excellent to get rid of some weak hands. 
facebook 50 million less hours spent and those eyes went to twitter! do not let anyone get your shares. hold out until at least 100!
This is a no brainer SHORT it good Options 4-6 months out

"No amount of CCP or Liberal Love/Hate dollars can keep this dog with fleas up. Expect a retrace to $43 before all the hype and pump. For liberals, when the CCP affectionately refers to you as 'Bay-zoo-ah' (phonetic), what does that mean?"
"On Feb. 3,2014- Twitter closed at 54.91Nearly 7 years later- Feb. 1, 2021- Twitter closed at 52.66 During that 7 year period, Twitter was down 3.09%., and yet during the exact period of time the DOW went from 15,794 to 30,212, for a rise of 91.29%. Relatively speaking, Twitter has been a terrible investment, and I believe it will continue be a lousy investment for the following facts: negative earnings, no dividend, recent reduction in users, a lawsuit for child sexual was filed last week, and additional child porn lawsuits are expected to be filed in the near future.People on the Left who have invested in Twitter for political reasons , not financial/business ones, I believe will come to regret it."
market down gas prices and taxes up this is what you voted for
Good report to a little profit taking into the tough tape today in my opinion… We’ll see a very nice response within the next five days in my opinion
rebound to $60 today easily!

"Just bought 5000 shares of TWTR at 52.76. Then it went down to 52.71. I had my other order to buy 5000 more shares at 52.68. To my surprise, it popped up to 54.80 in like a few seconds. I was like WTHeaven?Apparently some institutional investor(s) scooped up 5 million plus shares at the discounted price of 52.76 too.My patience paid off very well.  I have been waiting since earnings and since the bad news on limited user growth.GLTA"
"buy, Buy, BUy, BUY!!! More for me to BUY from you when you sell in a panic as this puffed price poorly run female canine plummets!"
"CNBC, Mike Santolli, Said Twitter drop was just profits taking due to stock up 22% year to date. Will be back up tomorrow after FaceBook earning."
"This is just profit taking. FB, NFLX and TWTR were way overbought. Look at their weekly charts and you will see. Wait a few days for the dust to settle and load the boat. NVDA dropped from $120 to $95, then shot up $265. Shake outs like this is healthy and buying low is when the big money is made."
"TWTR is a different company comparing with FB, which finally is recognized. TWTR Itself may be survived but will be difficult to complete with FB in terms of user number and advertising money. The unique value for TWTR is that it can work with other companies such as Disney, Google, MSFT, Salesforce, etc. to significantly improve their performance. As I posted early, TWTR will be brought at a price around $40 in 2018. Congratulates for LONGs. If you sell this one now, what can I say, you rally shouldn't trade stock."
Twitter cooks their books. This is worse than it looks.I was permanently suspended and had to form a new account. They will not allow me to cancel the old account.Ta Da! One person became two.I have heard from multiple people who have told me the same thing. It makes their retention and growth rate look good which allows them to sell ads. This artificially jacks up the stock price. Kind of a pyramid scheme!
Boycotting must be that bad!!

Remember, $FB is markedly below their 1 year share price target while $TWTR is AT their 1 year share price target.Facebook (FB) to Launch New Platform for Independent Writers9:54 am ET March 17, 2021 (Zacks)Facebook FB is in the process of introducing a self-publishing platform for independent writers and journalists, which would support them in terms of content creation and audience growth, per a Reuters report. It will be integrated with Facebook's Pages to enable publishing across multimedia formats including photos, live videos and stories style updates.The idea is that writers can earn through subscriptions to their work and potentially create additional revenue streams while relying on Facebook to engage their community.Facebook will allow them to create Groups for their work as well, and also provide metrics on their newsletters. To pilot the program, Facebook plans to pay to help get the tools to build actual websites, in addition to newsletters, off the ground. Moreover, the company will look to add monetization tools later."

"Business Insider sees Twitter's weakness. ""In this week's issue of New York Magazine (February 1, 2021), I make the case that Twitter's toxicity and subpar financial results are one and the same problem, amenable to one and the same solution. Fixing Twitter starts at the top — replacing an absentee CEO — and from there, changing the company's business model. The potential rewards are worth it, both economically and socially....All of this — Twitter's weak financial performance and its toxic content — is the result of a broken business model."""

"Twitter and Facebook exist solely to sell your personal information to third parties.

The video is posted on gateway pundit for investors to see. If I didn't know any better I wold swear Jack Dorsey is on a suicide mission involving Twitter. As a result I see Twitter continuing it's downward spiral which is roughly down 18% off the highs on January 6th. I don't see that changing as Twitter will reach the thirties over the coming weeks. This film won't do investors any good who believe Jack should try and repair those on the right which make up half of the nation. My guess is that Twitter lost at least 44 million of the 88 million subscribers who followed Trump. So you might say the ""Cancel Culture"" cancelled Twitter!"
omg... such a selloff
"It's obvious what's going on here. Facebook in a lot of heat. Over 40% of investors own these stocks through ETF's . These ETF's are heavily weighted towards Twitter, Facebook, and Snap . People and institutions want out of Facebook so the ETF's are being sold in massive quantities in order to reduce risk of holding Facebook. Since these are heavily weighted with Twitter stock, Twitter is taking a bigger hit. This is also causing people who got in around $24/$26 to be fearful and sell , taking their profits. Long story short. In 2 works Twitter will recover. I averaged down today buying more."
Enjoy the death spiral
"Can investor houses be sued for knowingly misleading investors to buy, hold or continue buying shares of a company that has so publicly imploded its business model? Just asking..."

Twitter business model...the sound of one hand clapping 
Asking for a friend who is a naturalized citizen (took him 12 years): Why do I need an ID to get a vaccine and then issued a 'Vaccination Card' but I don't need an ID to vote?As a great American citizen I told him his question was stupid and always trust your government to do the right thing.
"Seriously this was overpriced at $22 back in March. Look at it now, a total bubble waiting to burst. When this falls, the losses will be fantastic. Should never have been above $10, even then. What do they do? They sell your personal information, that's their whole purpose."
"Tax hikes, open borders, Americans getting censored and other Americans praising the government, Twitter and Fakebook for doing just so. Stimulus check that is going to cost you more in the long run than you receive. A government that is surrounded by razor wire to keep Americans out. Hows the left really treating you? Open your eyes and be aware."
The upcoming World Cup soccer will be very good to TWTR. They will make $$$ from streaming and such. Get in before it runs up to $40+

"India is getting ready to ban Twitter india has a population of 1,386,604,720. Consider how man users are in this country. Less viewers less money no growth for Twitter. I keep posting this information and it keeps getting removed pass it on."
Stay away! Will drop more!
TWTR continued down after hours
Negative earnings so you decide to drive away 50% of your consumers? LOL. Strong sell.
buy and hold through earning is the great life desion that you can make
"I'm glad Twitler is gone, hopefully forever."
I'm shorting 5000 shares to $18 see you there!
$40-$50 stock selling for $28+. This is amazing.
"A 50 Billion Dollar Company earns no money.A valuation of 25 billion is just as ridiculous becausethere are no earnings. Trump, used Twitter as his vehicleto spout his party line. In 4 years of Trump, Twitter lackedthe ability to earn any real money from Advertising.The senior management of Twitter lacks Executive functions of the brainto go to a paid subscriber model. No great push was made to hire the the real Don Draper, to promote the site. Twitter is a great stock to shortbecause, they lack a profit concept that earns money.Twitter should sell out to FB for $12 per share in FB stock.Senior management should be fired immediately."
Twtr. Should be trading much higher. Think about how much value is on twtr compared to a dancing cat video on Instagram. Twtr has real content where people break news stories.
I can't trade till 7am with my broker. I hope the stock isn't zero by then.
"Watch TWTR get an upgrade tomorrow. Just how wall street works since making that announcement today won't have any effect on the stock price. But if they upgrade tomorrow, another 10%."
China mouthpiece. Anti US company.
Growth rate is accelerating. Just less numbers due to millions of deleted accounts. Accounts will be cleaned up and stock will fly

this stock may be the new Facebook
Keep this up! TWTR is making the best short in the entire market.
I have this strange feeling TWTR will be bid on in 2018... $50 to $60 sounds reasonable for a service no one can compare or come close too... Let’s go!
It's been trading between 42. & 45 for a month.
remember after brenda said that a hour later in was upgraded and went to 63? lol
"Speaking of Failures, TWATR Down AGAIN!! OUCH!!"
"This now getting serious. It could drop to $45 by the end of May. The CEO caused this mess. Most companies fail due to poor products, reliability or changes in the Market. If it goes below $45 then the board has a responsibility to act! They have options but better move fast!"
"64 percent of Neanderthals reportedly think that cave drawings do more to divide Pangaea than unite it.

The poll also reported that the majority of sapiens (70 percent), Prosapiens (56 percent), young adults (61 percent), and seniors (71 percent) all believe that cave drawings are dividing the plateau."
some TWEETED by ACRX... watching ACRX... still think $FB will buy TWTR
Some people think that a shoddy business venture proposed by a disgraced one-term ex-President represents a threat to TWTR's business success. These same people believe DJT had a health care plan.
Musk's TWEET adds 8 billion to Tesla market cap today! Twitter needs some love like that
Nothing beats closing at the days lows. Let’s do this.
Best stock to own right now.
better hurry!sell $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL TWTR
President Trump will utterly destroy Twitter with his new social media network coming soon. Sell all shares now!
"if twitter directors are selling their shares now, how long before they have to declare the insider trades?"
Twitter is focusing on Quality in lieu of Quantity. This is my Media of Choice and I like the fact that they are cleaning up instead of racking up users. Twitter will be the Apple of Social Media.
"This looks attractive under 50, er, I mean 5, sorry about the zero typo."
"The problem with owning a stock like twtr is everyone knows about it. Good investments are ones that you uncover new ideas that no-one knows about yet , especially mutual funds, hedge funds etc. It's too late to make any real money on twtr... UNLESS you want to gamble every day and eventually lose all your money ... Move along"
Communist media sites don’t make money
"While legal, literate, educated, healthy people waited in line to years upon years to emigrate to America, the libs and dems say scru them, and demand bringing in illiterate, diseased and undocumented illegal aliens. No doubt they'll end up in dem cities where violent crime is out of control, where they can help turn these cities into open air toilets...with needles everywhere for tots to play with......the summer heat will bring out the fragrance....."
How could people not see this as a great buying opportunity?
I am outraged that someone who used FB and TWTR to whip up an attack on the U.S. Capitol isn't allowed back on these platforms to whip up another attack.
Time to start boycotting all advertisers on FB and Twitter and stop using Apple products plus cancel your Amazon prime and quit using Amazon. Write/email/text/call (or all of them) the advertisers and tell them you are never buying their products again as long as they advertise on FB and Twitter. Some group needs to start a website with a list of advertisers.
50week/200week moving avg just crossed up. long term trend... up and getting stronger. $65 after earnings!
Stolen elections have consequences especially when everyone in the world knows the election was stolen and Twitter helped enable the coup.
Deadcat Bounce. Going to Tank again. EOM.
"So very very very happy this morning to wake up to TWTR aka Twitter stock tanking -13.66% in pre-market. TWTR warned off slowing usage. Gee, ya think Jack Dorsey. You ban your #1 user, tick off half of your customer base with accounts being deleted (either voluntarily or via TWTR bans) and you do not expect your business model to suffer? TWTR and that homeless looking creepy CEO Jack the hack Dorsey deserve every bit of financial pain. Bring the TWTR plunge and short the living hell out of the stock. Enjoy the ride down slime ball."
"TWTR represents freedom from the dimwitted derelicts that tried overthrowing our government whiledirty donnie is still working on a new name for his marxist backed organization, its either the:1. white marxist supremist,2. marxist white nationalist."
"Could Twitter be the future of news and media and perhaps even elections? It seems like more and more celebrities, politicians, corporations, government departments, are bypassing the traditional media outlets and communicating directly to the public via Twitter. Any time I watch mainstream media (CNN, FOX, MSNBC, ect) they are just quoting Twittter posts and then offering spin and/or opinion!"
"Go to the RealPrez's new website and click desk. Its Better than TWTR!! Once he builds it out and lets us make our own accounts, TWTR is Toast!! Big Money knows its all OVER for this GARBAGE!!"
One of the best times to buy is when a stock is going down on low volume (with no news) as compared to recent increases on higher volume.
"ER was perfect before the WC, the beat it's obvious tomorrow.$48-49$50 won't be easy to break, but next week it's ok."
"Bob Baffert, who doped up Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit, blamed ""cancel culture"" on the backlash to his cheating and lying. You don't need to be a professional poker player to spot a tell. Someone who claims ""cancel culture"" is out to get them is guilty of shabby behavior of one kind or another."
"Obvious warning: If $TWTR finished at the low of the day or a hair different, watch out for Thursday and ESPECIALLY FRIDAY EOD. It could be multiple dollars ugly."
Didn't Jack Dorsey fund $10M to the BLM Riots? YES
"Almost put more money into $TWTR today, but realized they would eff up again like always."
Twitter may become obsolete sooner than you think due to censorship and ineffective advertising. It’s also reasonable to believe they make a lot of money under the table from organizations who want to manipulate the public. Hard to create a bullish thesis for this stock

$1400 for prisoners. The liberals are a joke. This post will be gone in a nanosecond like the rest of my posts.
"Many seem to make the claim that a recount, while finding ballots that weren't filled out correctly by DNC staffers might get tossed, they still won't close the gap that Biden supposedly has over Trump. That might be true.But the real test isn't that. These thousands of claims of voter fraud are being reviewed at this time. If systemic is proven but no remedy is given by the SCOTUS, it goes back to the House to determine the winner. The SCOTUS has already chimed in on Pennsylvania so they are going to get involved.Here's where it get fun.Each state gets one vote per state.And the GOP has more state legislators and governors in the House. I believe the number is 34.Guess what happens then?"
How is Jack and his communist brand of social media doing?
"I think Twitter has forgot that Americans will make you but they can break you , too!!!"
"If the world had banned the wermachts in the 20s, would we have saved 75,000,000 people in world war 2? Probably. Here today we have people making the case that World War 2 was a freedom of speech concern."

Twitter’s finally getting some love and respect.
"Hey... heyWhy should any American stand in line for hours to cast their vote? The proper voter legislation, is all precincts should be required to process a voter, within 30 minutes or they all go to federal prison for 15 years. All of them."
Time has come for TWTR to be acquired.
More shorts added
"Good long term hold, especially when paid Twitter launches"
"TWTR is the least successful social media, so painful to invest from. Dorsey is shameless. He must go."
FB is having a real problem with young adults. My 23 year old NEVER posts to FB - but she Tweets a whole lot. It would seem that FB really caught on with that 'MySpace' generation and their parents; now near 30 somethings and grandparents. Twitter is IT and FB is not.
Uganda blocking twitter before their elections....The beginning of the end.
LOL liberal snowflake longs deserve this ahhahaaha.
"For Saturday night fun, let's compare and contrast the Governors of our four largest states: CA, TX, FL, NYReady ... goooo!!!If ever there were more stark contrasts in America, I don't know what they would be."
You guys care too much about politics. Don’t trade in feelings. Trade on fundamentals.
"Social(ist) Media now paying upwards of $30,000 for a single video from an ‘influencer’ (ref: CNN Business article 19 March 2021). Major Panic among socialist media now that all major intelligent ‘influencers’ have departed. My opinion, no, CNN, sorry.$TWTR and $FB future not as bright as yesteryear. Invest wisely. Read the CNN article and ask ‘What is going on here?’."
Today's action has all the hallmarks of a stock price faceplant by EOD. Wasn't this $55 and change earlier?

"I bet Dorsey was so relieved at the end of the day from holding TWTR up all day, throwing so much money at it so it wouldn't go below $45. He's thinking, I got time, it's a 3 days weekend."
kathy woods has been making bad moves these days.... look at OPEN lol
"The end of Twitter is not near. The decline of Twitter toward a very poor choice among many similar service providers is well underway. The techno-fascist oligarchy is fervently trying to deplatform the emerging providers like Parler. But they will fail because although they have consolidated a great deal of power through monopolistic behavior, the world is waking up the ideological fascism Twitter espouses."
I only used Twitter because of 45. platform is really boring and useless now.
I would like to welcome all recent TWTR investors to Bagholders Annonymous
"Sidney Powell has moved to dismiss Dominion's defamation lawsuit. Her argument: when she accused Dominion of being part of an election-rigging scheme with ties to Venezuela, ""no reasonable person would conclude"" those ""were truly statements of fact"". So....that's the ""free speech"" GOP blowhards feel is at such great risk. What a joke. It's disinformation that gets booted off of any self-respecting platform."

Has Parler announced a GoFundMe page for Matt Gaetz yet and will any excess donations be set aside for when the Turnip is reelected and appoints Matt Gaetz as Secretary of Child Services?
"Today was a great day for growth tech investors. $PINS, which has been a Top Pick of mine for a while, was no exception. With days like today, we have to keep a longer-term context in perspective. Understand the long-term narrative, and discount back to present value. So here goes...$PINS is the most unique ""social media platform"" available from both a user and advertiser perspective. So unique in fact, that I would only use the term social media platform as a loose descriptor. Pinterest is really an eCommerce search engine of sorts. Users use the Pinterest platform as a way of gaining inspiration. Whether it be fashion, home decor, or travel, Pinterest is an inspiration engine. Compared to $FB or $TWTR, where users are left in a generally negative headspace after using the app, $PINS users have a generally more positive experience. Why? Because they're being inspired. It's that simple.This positivity on the platform correlates to sticky engagement (emphasis on sticky). As you use Pinterest more and more, the platform collects more and more data on your interests, your taste, and other important insights into how you are inspired. Why is this important? It means Pinterest is able to understand a lot about their users, using merely first party/on-platform insights. They aren't really subject to third party targeting (think third party ad cookies) and they won't see much of a headwind from $AAPL's IDFA change (if/when it ever happens). Simply put, $PINS just works for advertisers. We see it in $PINS users' purchasing behavior. Out of all the social media platforms, $PINS has the highest percentage of users who purchase a product after using the platform. $PINS is monetizing its user base at ~$3/MAU annually (as of 2020). Keep in mind, peer $FB is monetizing at ~$30/MAU annually (again as of 2020). So, you could argue the attack opportunity from monetization alone is 10x. This neglects any further growth in the user base as Pinterest evolves and expands (especially internationally).Yes, on a short-term basis it's expensive. Yes, there is a lot of execution risk. But take a long-term view. We're at ~$45 billion in market cap, for a fundamental story that could be worth ~$100B+ one day (my view). Right now, 2021YE PT is ~$130/share based on 2030 valuation discounted back to year end value. Will update you all in the future. Long $PINS"
"Closed at its lows. More red on Monday, Tuesday, Friday next week."
get WOKE go BROKE--- how can I help with that ---
"Here come the Analysts “Buy” ratings.. Institutions will be pouring in. Sales force CEO wanted to buy TWTR at 25 a few years ago, but shareholders said “ no”. Marc Benioff is probably taking another look. Buying profits is easier than creating profits in today’s tech space. Someone will buy TWTR soon."
Institutional ownership of $twtr is on the rise again and trending higher on top free apple apps. I’m buying into any weakness.
Twitter is the definitive falling knife... This thing is going to fall so fast. we'll get dizzy watching it go...
"95% of Democrat voters believed the Democrat bought and paid for ""Russian Collusion"" fake news narrative that was spun 24/7 by the democrat side of the fence for 3 straight years.

Maybe believing that walls don't work anymore as you sit safely behind the walls of your own home may, who knows. What more ons yet they think they're so smart lol. Fail."

Interesting article on twtr....https://newrepublic.com/article/161995/twitter-saudi-arabia-mbs-dissident
Maybe some FB investors should have switched their holdings into Twitter.
"The next base of support for TWTR is at $24, the price that Elliot Management and Silver Lake bought it for last March. The question is whether or not Elliot Management and Silver Lake want to sell their stake or if they want to make organization changes in upper management. The political animus within TWTR's rank and file employees in hurting their ability to reverse their losses on the balance sheet."
I must be dreaming..The New York times fact checked bi-dens speech and found it full of lies..Whoever fact checked bi-dens speech probably has been fired already.....

"FB went public in 2012 at $38, TWTR went public in 2013 at $26. There is little difference in the age of the companies, the price difference was only $12 at the IPO price. Today FB is higher by $250+. The difference is not in the age of the companies, the difference is the competence of the CEOs."
This is so SCARY!! What is happening to TWATR?? #CommieCrash
Selling data is much different then leaking users private data. Bloomberg story is a non news event.

"When you #$%$ off over half of America by censoring their freedom of speech, you probably shouldn't be called a social media company. Instead of calling it Twitter, you probably should call it communist talking points for beginning communism."
"Not so long ago, January 15th in fact, just a few months ago, close was $45.18. Not a political statement, a fact.Retraces are painful."
Twitter should be rising on Facebook news. Facebook losing ad dollars to Twitter. FB loss is TWTR gain.
Anyone adding more shares this week?
Twtr is a buying opportunity on this drop. Remember the guy who created Square and helped create Twitter is still in charge of Twitter. I doubt Noto is so indispensable that we forget those facts

"If TWTR didn't clear up the 70 million fake accounts, it would beat all three areas in the 2Q earning report including earning, revenue, and MAUs, and the stock price could be around $50. TWTR has been punished for doing right thing. I believe that Investors will be back to TWTR soon and the price of TWTR will go up to $40 in one to two months."
Strong Buy! Stock will recover and be gold. Hold until next year...
Great earnings out of Google. Amazon's not too bad either. Now we just need a strong market day tomorrow and a big beat by Twitter. Twitter could jump 15%+ tomorrow.

5th time posting.....Maxine wants the protesters to be more confrontational. She should try to cool things down instead of fanning the flames. Let her live where they are rioting and looting. Another comment that will be gone in a nanosecond. What gives Maxine the right to free speech over me?
"Jack Dorsey has banned Project Veritas on Twitter, blocking the #2 news story worldwide. Here it is as long as Yahoo allows it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv8Zy-JwXr4"
Under 50 gonna drop 10k right away
Lololol the best is that libs are STILL chasing and STILL burning
Twitter will be up .50 cent at the open tomorrow. This bird is soaring back.
A company with such great ethics on the slide how could this be
"I laughed when the directors at Twitter came out a few months ago, and said their numbers will be amazing in the coming quarters. Yeah right, after having canceled 80 million people from their platform, no way. It's all leftists propaganda, just like CNN."
conservative minded SEC attorneys are thoroughly scouring $TWTR financial statements to see if there were any disclosures made warning investors that Twitter is a left leaning political organization..despite what they say they are in business with Democrats..politically biased to the point of purposely alienating 1/2 their customer base..if these risk were not disclosed..they will be open to shareholder class action lawsuits
Millions of Twitter accounts closed. This stock will drop like a rock.
Gotta love it when Twitter shakes off a downgrade....and motors on....
"$PINS is becoming a brand name.Like $FB $TWTR $SNAP.. In. Long run this is a Gem. It is a long term buy. Their data, is priceless."
This is headed to $38+ fast. Don't miss it.
Be nice to see a 4 dollar move up for a change!!
"All three counts guilty and yet the left still upset. They say not enough! Well they will get to see a pound of flesh soon, unfortunately their idols will be the ones sacrificed this time , all for the world to see."
My goodness the Commie bulls have pushed this up. So disappointed. Hopefully this is just a momentary uptrend before resumption down to 40s.
"Nuts, the censor police got my HRC v JRB vote total comparison."
"Twitter, FB, appleSold all shares and will NEVER buy again. Twitter actions prove that they are not fair and report only news they feel is appropriate. No freedom of speech with these companies. I urge everyone to stay away from these socialist companies"
"Political Hack site Project Veritose never lost a lawsuit , People like freedom of expression there is tooo much competition coming that will provide it"
SNAP no earnings or free cash flow at $20 billion market cap. TWTR with $1 billion in free cash flow trading at 13x earnings has a $23 billion market cap? I would say there is value here.
They could not pay me to tweetMuch less me pay themWhat a jokeSee you at 2 bucks
"Ruh-Roh sayeth Scoob ... don't birds of a feather flock together $SNAP $PINS and $TWTR???""Amid Covid-19-related lockdown orders by various governments around the world, social media stocks such as Pinterest and Snap have enjoyed healthy gains. Pinterest shares have surged nearly 500% in the past year, and Snap has notched a similar advance.But BofA Securities analyst Justin Post wrote in a client note Monday that there is little upside left in either stock. Post downgraded both Snap (ticker: SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) to Neutral from a Buy."""
"On Monday the founder of Project Veritas, James O'Keefe will be suing Twitter for defamation. Doubt it will initially have any impact on the stock but will be another nail in the coffin of Dorsey. The woke crowd is keeping him employed at Twitter but it won't last.In the end all Oligarchs fall and Dorsey will be no exception. Though I think Dorsey is more of a wannabe Oligarch than an actual one."
Dow is up 460 points. But twiddledy is down .45%. If you invest now you would have to wonder if it will keep going down?
Remember. This is still UP year-to-date. This wont have a green day for weeks. So much room to fall. I’m not even short but I feel like I am!!! Go woke go broke. Have a great weekend my fellow Americans.
No one should underestimate the heart of a champion especially JD.He took SQ to the moon and he may take Twitter to Mars.
Hopefully we will have a good day for twitter. Should continue to move up.
"That's what you get for silencing Conservatives. Lesson learned. They've probably cooked their DAUs. Lawsuits should show the real one. Tens of millions left/ banned and this sham company still reported 20% growth? That's not reality. I left Twitter, my relatives and friends left Twatter after the elections. I pulled off my ads from Twatter. A lot of people I know left Twatter."
EPS BEATS $.16 vs $.12 EST. REV BEATS $665M vs $607M EST. MAU BEATS 336M vs 334M EST. Guidance for Q2 is $265 vs $217 EST. Nothing else to say but Buy Buy Buy.
"Powell, FROM THE ROTHSCHILD non-US entity Federal Reserve will attempt to blow sunshine at noon up everyone's backside.There is no hiding inflation, treasury yield increases, hiking oil prices ... his masters message will eventually fall on deaf ears as lending rates are at or near zero and can't be lowered in inflationary times!THEY HAVE TO STOP PRINTING MONEY, IT DEVALUES EVERYTHING IN THE USA."

The CIA feeds the MSM the talking points to be reiterated ad nauseum. ""Behold the Pale Horse"", 1991, Chapter Twelve, page 225. Wake-up to media and social media psyops, they are parrots. Notice mass shooting started just after a certain person departed? Oh, just coincidence, sure."
Why Twitter (TWTR) Stock Looks Like a Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings Thursday https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-twitter-twtr-stock-looks-214709162.html
"The market essentially laughed in the face of Morgan Stanley today. They downgrade the price, and the TWTR stock price climbs 50 cents. This was just a cheap attempt by MS to manipulate Twitter's price likely for their own gain, so they could buy-in cheaper prior to earnings release. The MS analyst who downgraded is now a laughing stock! See you all at $45 in just a few weeks."
"keep long , u will see $80 soon before the end of 2018"
Short 48.23. can't see this not going lower
Buy low. Thanks for the pullback. Fly Birdy Fly!
"Revenue beat and super user growth, which is the key for Twitter. Going over $43 today."
Trump2024And beyond!!!!!!!!
Most of Twitter's accounts are fake. It is all smoke and mirrors with them.
well...no way anyone could have expected that
will close at 44.00 today
Keep chasing libs. Cathie wood can’t save you when you alienate half of America.
This is what happens when your hack company gets involved in the cancel culture. Take notice.
"TWTR has been recovered from political rumors and Mr. Left's bad mouth, and is getting stronger. It will reach $40 sooner than most people thought. Nobody can stop the bird!"
hey lebron.... when are you relinquish your past and sell all your belongings and come live with us in the inner cities of Chicago my brother.
This is what happens when you mess with the RealPrez. Lesson learned. EOM.
"Revenue up 24%. Will beat guidance huge next quarter. Great buying opportunity. Hold shares, or add. Will pop back quickly today."
How many people were dumb enough to buy this knowing how many users were being cancelled over the past quarter??? I mean really people.. I bet you all still trust the financial media too..
Make Jack Dorsey Pay.. Cancel Square too..
If you couldn't see this coming you deserve it
Does it just infuriate you 7 million were able to get off of food stamps during the last 4 years? Do we need to get back to the good old days of more dependence?

My so called online annalists has had a sell rating and informed me once again to sell twtr. I unloaded some half about 3 weeks ago and another 400 l hundred on Tuesday and was only holding on to 200 hundred and then sold 100 to be net long just 100 hundred shares. I started to get concerned even before Facebook with all the put action this week on twtr. But I figured that I should hang on to something for the fun of it and puff. I feel for people that were long on this stock as this probably wasn't what most people expected and hopefully both Facebook and twtr will rebound in the near future.
"Head and shoulders pattern complete on the 1 year chart, going to tank significantly."
"Happy to see the dems creating a crisis at the border...no worries, the libs are still on track for turning every dem city into an open public toilet replete with public defecation and urination....lots of litter, noise and added crime for a bonus....the tent people will resent the competition....new higher taxes and fees will be needed to keep the show going...but the smell, that added bouquet will be on the house...."
"The Censoring commies loves to hang out on this Twitter page. Hard to believe that one American would ever want to censor another American of their freedom of speech, to protect their the government that is laced with razor wire around their headquarters."
"Communists and fascists ban free speech and books their ideologies do not mesh with. Liberty's strong roots are grounded solidly in public free speech, discourse and dissent; even if multiple parties disagree, take opposing sides on issues, spew untruths at times, call others out hurting feelings, and can be diametrically opposed to any governmental edict.The word 'Liberty' is absolutely foreign to a communist."
since everybody shorting $TWTR I might as well short it. plus what $TWTR did was kinda messed up.
Buy any dips. News is coming out.
"I don't understand it, Joe Biden won the election over the weekend, which means Twitter will be saying goodbye to someone who has had noticeable influence over the stock. This means Twitter will lose ad revenue and their user count will go down. This will affect their bottom line. So why is this stock going UP!?"
"Chart tested and won, up again"
"Ouch, heading for a 3% loss today. Why are so many accounts being cancelled and moving to another platform?"
Now we know why the Demcoms were so Scared of the AZ Audit. They Cheated! They even Criminally Destroyed Evidence days before the Audit and theyre still hiding other Evidence!
"Well, I'll tell you: with all the commotions over the UN and SCOTUS, the traffic on TWTR will skyrocket this Q. I am all in at this price!"
"Nice move for your shareholders, Jack! What were you smoking??"
I deactivated on the 6th and sold all social media shares when antifa initiated a riot on capitol hill. It was then that confirmed to me we are being manipulated.
"This could be an epic fail April 30th. For those who are strictly gambling with little information except 'it will go higher', the company's last earnings press release clearly stated they expect a range of breaking even to a loss of $50,000,000 Q1. Not my words, theirs. Can't make this up. Brutal."
"Racist Twitter let this trend for about 12 hours..""I had hoped that Scott might show some common sense, but it seems clear he is little more than an oreo with no real principles,"" Lamar County Democratic Party chair Gary O'Connor"
Look at the quarterly income from continuing operations quarter over quarter. You are looking at a drop of over 60% if you look at Yahoo!'s posted numbers. Those are not good numbers. You are seeing the results of flushing accounts that bring significant engagement.
Love it...lower everytime I check!!!!! Short this pig!!
"Sponsored post:Twitter's growth over the long term is said to be its ability to connect advertisers with users. Check disclaimer in the landing page.

Earnings are not going to improve with an eroding user base. It can only get worse.
All the angry boomers in this discussion lol
Set to sell half of my Twitter shares at $105.00.
thanks Cathy. I just bought in at Friday close.  should see some strength now
This is such a discount
How long until this stock drops from their new competitor?
"White House to be painted in Chinese Red, to thank the CCP and Dominion for stealing the 2020 election."

Twitter's real time information is incredibly value and unique from any platform. Twitter is also pushing hard on its live video programmings on your feeds in which will add more users and ads revenues.
"What is with media ? even FOX. tonight FOX seems to of censored Tucker Carlsons audio for about 5 seconds and then went to commercial. If this is the beginning of socialism for USA , no thank you."
Hopefully TWTR's Stock Price doesn't Completely COLLAPSE in the last 35 minutes because that would be bad
The Democratic cesspool is going down!!
Downside around 58 bucks Upside HAHAHA
short short short
this is how you lose freedom of speech. yesterday was a sad day in America. the American people are being treated like China where they control what you hear and suppress info they don't like.its a complete double standard. I sold my stock in twitter months ago. I couldn't in good faith invest in this company. I hope they are held accountable
Don't be deceived by this earnings release. It actually makes sense because this report includes data when trump was still on the platform and during this time he was causing all sorts of drama due to the election situation. The next earnings release is the one you need to be concerned with since those earnings will include when Trump was banned and the subsequent fallout from it.
Anyone know when we will be getting our next stimulus check? I will buy moretwtr shares and maybe more stuff online from China.
going below $50...
Looks like enough time has passed for investors to regain confidence. Should be smooth ahead barring any bad news
"Listening to the 'Big Guy' ... pushing vaccinations with spiffs from businesses ... pushing for kids 12-15, follow the science, why???In my state (state reported) we have had 2 deaths from COVID-19 in this age range out of 18,017 confirmed cases (with most likely 5-10x that many actual cases). 2 is horrible but statistically insignificant.But they can give it to someone else!!! FINE, ALL SOMEONE ELSES should get vaccinated IF THEY WISH. This is an emergency use only clinical trial for all 3 vendors with no recourse for adverse reactions or death.How about the FDA gets approval?"
So which trillion dollar big tech will acquire this?
Easiest short this year. Losing accounts caused by jack’s censorship. Love watching this crash to 20 or below.
Thank god you all aren’t on Twitter  LONG TWTR
"I just purchased one share of Twitter. I am willing to sacrifice this money, just so I can enjoy watching the chart slope down in my portfolio."
Nasdaq down for two days in a row and this is up 5 percent. I don’t get it. So much room to fall.
Markets are on fire. Even NASD up triple digits. Guess what’s not?!?! Beautiful karma.
TWITTER IS PROBABLY THE SECOND BIGGEST FRAUD STOCK ON THE MARKET AFTER FACEBOOK... TWITTER SEEMS TO BE MORE HONES ABOUT THEIR HORRIBLE USER NUMBERS.
It’s not at all the same as Facebook. They are not guiding down revenue and that was the key driver for the fall in Facebook. Investors will see the difference
upgraded to 42 per share. by van trading group. trump will be the official chairman for Twitter during the 2020 elections.
Hows the censorship working out libtards?

"Artificial intelligence is the key in the future and Twitter got it. I’m looking for Apple, Google, MicroSoft and SaleForce to make the move in the coming weeks to acquire Twitter. They can not wait since Twitter will be in the $30 around earning announcement."
Social Media is dying....time to switch to ammunition and guns.....sell this and put your money in POWW
Jack is in India to promote Twitter and have met their president and many celebrities. Twitter should pickup tens or even hundreds million users from India that has a population of more than 1.1 billion people.
"Poorliar platform went down again, it was up to 1.83% capacity and it collapsed again, poorliar subscribers should quit lying and go to a real board that does not use russian language for its second language."

Stocks can not go up every day or they would all be so expensive no one could afford them!! Take it easy and enjoy our ride to the 40's we all know it is going there!!
Index funds need to buy 77.6 millions shares of twitter tomorrow. Big buy orders are coming.
Nice entry point. 100 shares at $56.
Don’t forget to give them a 1 star rating on App Store when you close your Twitter account.
This could be the beginning of a huge run...
"I called MJWL last week its up 90%, the next major play is MRPT!!"
one thing for sure is Twitter's one of the hottest stocks around I predict low 50s by June
The financials are stellar. The growth in cash provided by operations is one key metric I consider.
"6/17/20 DOJ proposes rollback of protections for platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Google. Lawyers will have a field day."
People like Chuck are very representative of the caliber of people remaining on Twitter.
is it the market or did this convertible debt kill us for good?
3 to 1 are betting against twtr... 14% move up or down? What do you think and why? I am holding 2500 now... in at 42.25 and 46.66...
Will be red by end of day.
"BIG EARLY AM: Price upgrade from a nobody (get some of their clients out?) certainly gets a bunch of folks hopes hopping! As relayed earlier, many DCBs (dead cat bounces) off of pressers ... this being one. No revenue, expense, user, etc. changes ... unless I missed something."
social media is very harmful to your mental health. and it is not a skill. a 6-year old with a phone can do it.You are much better off without FB and Twitter.
Needs post-lunch rally.
CATHIE Wood buys :0 Bad sign
internet providers in Conservative states are now starting to block FB and Twitter.
"Jim Cramer ... buy because money is rotating into the private convertible bond (really? so many common shareholders have access to that debt, not) from common shares.

Wow. Lin Wood on Parler views shows why Twitter is in trouble. The views are insane as his followers increase to over 1.1 million. Ashli is alive while Twitter and the other horrific Facebook went along to destroy our freedoms. 5.2 million views. https://parler.com/profile/linwood/posts

Increasing ad prices for World Cup - now that is a first and a game changer for TWTR.
"sleepy joes accomplishments have just been amazing.....gas lines throughout the south, gas prices up 40-50% in less than half a year, crisis at the southern border where hundreds of thousands of illiterates have flooded across with ZERO COVID TESTING, commodities up 50-100% across the board, positioning the US to abandon Israel, cutting back room deals with the Iranian Ayatollah, creating a welfare state that incentivizes people to not work so hundreds of thousands of small business go under, created a commission to determine if pronoun enforcers are needed, oh yeah....he's just doing wonders...him stroking out would be his best gift to everyone....."
"Nice to see this junk stock selling off and the speech squashing, acid dropping, coke snorthing, horse shooting Dorsey lose millions with each passing day. Hopefully soon he'll be forced to take up residence in one of California's tent cities where he belongs."

"Politics aside, the polarization we can observe in the real world will be reflected in social media, rather sooner than later.For Twitter, this means it will lose a huge chunk of its user base (mainly conservatives) to Parler."
Citron made the move. Google will make the ultimate move soon. Buy buy buy.
"Wish I had sold at $47. But I got greedy, and now I don't think I'll see that price again. Fact is, I really worry about how Twitter is gonna fare once we have a POTUS who doesn't communicate via Twitter. Twitter obviously is getting way more play than it normally would because millions and millions of people follow Trump's tweets every day."
Bouyght at $58.00 lol be back in $60s real quick.
"TRTW might drop to $40 tomorrow. But it may not stop there. If Parler keeps FREE speech, then Twitter will file bankruptcy in 12 months. Twitter users will keep deleting accounts."

"TWTR is down over $10 in the last 10 days, Awesome !!"
"""Know - how"" is good, ""know - who"" is better, that's what Warren Buffett's advice for stock investors. This advice is a perfect fitting for TWTR, which is the one of the best SM companies and more importantly, Jack is one of the best leaders in not only SM companies but all business areas in the world. I have so much confidence to this company and truly believe that TWTR will pass $40 after next earning report, and will go $50 by the end of 2018, and will reach $100 in 2019."
I could see this coming after what happened to PINS.
"TWATR is Toast!! No matter where it closes today it is already ""GUARANTEED TO TANK"" Tomorrow!!"

"What is the advertising model for Fränk? Or is it self fueled anti-Twitter hate? Just pillows and moldy survival gear from Jones’ basement? Advertisers are serious. They aren’t taking fake calls from false presidents. The advertising industry was “uniquely positioned to push these networks – whether mass media or social media – to do their utmost to ensure that hatred and conspiracy theories are not amplified,” he continued.Greenblatt at the time called on Fox News to fire Carlson — its most-watched prime time personality. Fox News chiefs dismissed the demand.“Commit to this fight. Choose a side,” added Greenblatt. “Choose to pause or even pull your ads, not just from problematic programs, but altogether from networks that don’t respect all people or that repeat baseless conspiracies that endanger all of us.”"
"You can thank the Neanderthal thinking of the dementia patients illegit administration for the current crisis going on at our Southern border. While you're stuck at home with no job, mounting bills and kids being denied a basic education, the illegit twit is welcoming thousands of Covid infected illegals into the country to take your jobs, your healthcare and your money via undeserved Covid relief funds. The resounding truth is stolen elections have consequences and radical demo communists deplore you."
"Don't fail me now. I bet on you at 18 and gave up at 20. Bet again this time at 31. I think this time will work. Snap proved to be failing, Facebook still strong but showed some weakness and that there is a spot that it doesn't really fill. I'm looking for $50."
Dumping all $TWTR and $FB stocks. Censorship=communism. No thank you.
"If politically, you are anywhere right of the extreme left, there is no reason to be on Twitter. You will feel threatened and unwanted. Mostly likely banned by twitter."
"I held Twitter shares since 2014 until today. I have been saying in the last 4 years that Twitter and Facebook are totally different machine. One is for family and friends gossips and update while the other is purely for political, financial, local and world news discussion. Twitter provides much better updates about how our economy and our country is doing when FB does not at all. The analysts need to get more educated and wise to separate these two companies apart and not to compare both of them side by side. It is a total different machine."
Wow GAB has picked up Millions of New Users in the last few days!
On executive compensation yahoo says Dorsey earns 1. If that's a buck he's being over paid.
"Shorting this from now on. It should be and must be an opportunity to express yourself. Freedom of speech? I think Twitter lost their core daily user by this move. We all know that what he/other did was wrong, but come on... Norway."

sell twtr and fb stocks before TRUMP social media site start
I'm buying Twitter at $35
TWTR definitely has strong support at $0
Last one out is a rotten egg
Those who sold in the pre-markets will be regretting the decision soon!
Jack Dorsey when the camera is off.
Going to $40. There are no catalysts and no justification for this inflated valuation based on lies. Save what little capital you have left.
Any company that is asking for proof of an experimental vaccine for employment proof should should be sue4d into oblivion for damages . Not only is it illegal and but also Unconstitutional
This would have been in the 50's by now if not for the 1 little glitch imo I see a full recovery to the mid 40's
World Cup tweets were viewed 115 billion times
I hope they go Bankrupt.
They will try to accumulate your shares today. Don’t sell it to them. Twitter will be soaring to $40 near term.
Jack Dorsey looks like the ceo of homeless people in LA
"Twitter acquires Scroll to build out its subscription productMay 04, 2021 9:20 AM ETTwitter, Inc. (TWTR)By: Brandy Betz, SA News EditorTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) is acquiring web technology company Scroll for undisclosed terms and will integrate the solution into a broader subscription service later this year."
Been in the market for 30 years and can tell you exactly what happened and what will happen next. 2 days before earnings there was 160K Calls sold and 140K Puts just for July 27th exp. Which was VERY high for TWTR. Someone straddled the stock hard and needed a big movement in either direction at least 9% of the closing price. As soon as earnings came out the user numbers were weak and they pounded it with tons of shares short. Once it sold off over 12% the avalanche just kept going. So where does it go from here. Next what needs to happen is the buyers from 33 up (weak hands) will capitulate and it will bottom out over the next week. It should form a base here shortly and stick in a 2-3 dollar trading range for a few weeks. Then it will follow the direction of the market. I think it would be a good buy in that 28 range as they are finally learning how to monetize their user base. I can easily see this back in the high 30's or even 40's after next Q earnings.
"Hope Frank can pull it off, up, over, on, whatever they need to outwit Twitter. You know, basics. Registration, terms of service, an online system of messaging. Even that him ler over at parlour could find enough ex Russians to bring his home page back up. Maybe Mike needs some Mercer cash?"
maybe XO joe can issue another one and demand the NYSE list this at 80 a share...............LOL
"Eventually within this year at least, this will close at $5.22, not $55.22."
2 impeachments + 2 popular vote losses = 1 term.

"It's Friday, January 15, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today?"
"A 78 year-old decides to run for POTUS. He has run twice before, dropping out the first time for admitted plagiarism, the second time dropping out after gleaning a mere 2% of the primary vote. The 78 year-old then picks one of the most unpopular democrat politicians in America (among democrats) as his running mate after also dropping out of a presidential campaign with 2% of the primary vote and gaining zero delegates.This 78 year-old campaigns by basically staying at home, holding almost no rallies and refuses to give his stance on major issues affecting the election.He wins by gleaning almost 16,000,000 more votes than Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama received.Of course the intellectually curious are not still skeptical, it makes perfect sense."

Not every tech stock has fallen every single day for the last 3 weeks. Not every tech stock DESERVES to fall every single day for the next 3 weeks and next 3 months. But THIS does. Who is ready for the 40s today?!?

Leaked earnings?????
"if everyone's banning you from every where maybe instead of inaccurately calling everyone a communists and inaccurately thinking you have some right to say whatever you want on their private platform you should look in the mirror, try taking some responsibility for your choices, or go to another free app and cry endlessly i guess."
This junk breaks to the downside and breaches $50 tomorrow. Adios moon-chachos!
Fade. To. Close.
Today will close $65 and above.
I'm hoping the company is forced to be broken up. Dorsey thinks he some sort of God looking down at all of us and deciding what our fate should be according to his principles. I for one want to decide for myself what good or bad.
"I see Twitter at $40+ soon. This would be great! But I think it’s a stretch. However, it’s seems more plausible after a few scotches. Funny how that works!"

You will never be free as long as we use Dominion voting machines.
Twitter is not only overvalued it is sinking to new lows and may not survive as cancellations are at a record level. Ad revenue will collapse as sponsors realize the audience is diminishing. If you are smart you will get out now while there is still some value left. Now before the real losses mount.
See you at 40.

"I have a small stake in TWTR and don't too much care how it performs, over the long haul or the short haul. Much more important: we got rid of the most toxic prez in U.S. history, got a new prez who pushed through the immensely popular relief package (which the last one would not have done), and will soon reach a version of herd immunity due to vaccine distribution and administration being operationalized in a way old prez never would have achieved. The future is so much brighter than it looked 6 months ago."
tomorrow twtr fill in the gaps. maybe we can reach 33.00. i hope so
The stock will be up 20% in a week if the earnings report is great and the management show what they have been doing since the Investor Day. Trumpets will be crying with Doritos dust and drinking #$%$flavor mountain dew.

"Square is run by dorsey. People will short this hard and good longs will sell, cant believe twitter is banning conservatives outright know even rush $sq $twtr"
Twitter has continued censoring/banning accounts with opposing viewpoints. Why would anyone support/vote for this? Why would anyone think this is a good investment for their hard-earned money? This has to end. Let your money speak. Cancel Twitter.
Anyone have news of the bankruptcy? Should I sell all shares?
Might find support at $30. Until then. Better money to be made buying value stocks that don’t pick political correctness over neutrality.
The best way to make twitter pay for free speach sensorship is to sell all your shares. Let’s make this go down to zero!!!
"Prediction: By the close on Friday, big changes for TWATRs stock price."
"I am as conservative as they come, but this is market capitalism. When you take off your political blinders and look at Twitter's actual quarter in financial terms, the numbers are strong.

some of the best things shared on fb are tweets. anyone still run to fb to see what's happening? fb is good to read the articles about what happened live on Twitter yesterday.
We should be tweeting
It is a great stock but will have to be shelve it for the long ( very long ) term. Fact that its steadily going down is idicative that institutions are selling everyday to reduce their positions. This could mean that earnings are not expected to be on par...
This garbage isn't worth $20/share let alone $58. No upside as subscribership nosedives and they still stink and monetization. Always have.
You have an iPhone. iOS asks you if you want to be tracked by Twitter.You say no. Twitter can’t make money from ads. Twitter is done.
Hey Jack Dorsey! Love your hair#$%$ Whatd you take off about 30% over the last month? Maybe shave your jihadi beard to make it 40% you ridiculous speech suppressor!
good decision even if in the short term the share price will go lower. I am long
Tomorrows Gap Down will be SO BAD!! TWTR might be in $30's!!
Ouch! Now things get interesting. The CEO caused this mess and shareholders are not happy. Shareholder litigation could be a possibility? The board will need to protect the company and its shareholders.
"Look at the $PINS chart and you will see the future for $TWTR (or TWATR if you prefer). A social media company who publically acknowledges they haven't a clue on future expected user growth rates (or declines), future mDAU, etc. is just making investor float in a sea of uncertainty. Uncertainty means stock price declines, no exceptions.Remember, TWITTER is over 15 years-old, this is a long-in-the-tooth tech company that caters to a very, very narrow demographic."

I have been watching twtr stock for long time. Everyday. Twtr is up in this kind of down market today. There will be big jump soon. Its a pattern.
next leg down??? lets go...
Still zero reason to buy this. Even if you hate America.
TWATR $45 and change by the holiday. Vacuous hole of blathering that does humanity zero good … and a deeply flawed business model to boot!
"Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is up 2.9% amid a start at Buy with a healthy price target from LightShed Partners.• It's ""simply a better product now,"" Rich Greenfield writes in a report that sets its price target just off the Street high, at $45 (now implying 23% upside).• A ""more compelling/useful consumer experience"" is boosting user metrics and making onboarding easier, Greenfield says, and newly introduced Topics will be a key catalyst for growth and engagement, which should lead to better-than-expected revenue growth."
Good riddance jack
i don’t see any bombing coming from Israel  but i see gaza is shelling Israel with impunity.

DeadCats might Bounce but DeadBirds just go SPLAT
Pinterest market cap is $18B. Twitter is $30B. Is there any logic or reason left in these markets? Did it ever exist in the first place?
"So all that money that was handed to BLM, where is it? Is it true that it found its way into the bank accounts of the three RACIST MARXIST hags who run that organization. We should be told. Seriously Jack, what happened to that $10 Million of SHARE-HOLDERS MONEY you gave them?"

Russia doesn't seem to like TWTR. Would not be surprised to see it banned over there. Not good for TWTR. Nope.
the best social media platform hands down
Someone from Twitter needs to address the stock slip to reassure investors all is on steady ground. This is too large of a drop for the executive team to stay silent.
this should be a $65 stock
"Analysts are going to assess the TWTR's 4 Q earning soon as they did last few Qs, and most likely to upgrade or raise earning estimation. TWTR should have a solid earning report in both revenue and MAUs. Jack was in India (population of 1.1 billion) to promote Twitter two moths ago, it should pick up few million MAUs in India."
"Sadly, because fox is not a news conglomerate but an entertainment agency, tweets calling for it to have truth in its broadcasts, and faith in its efforts to provide factual content to viewers goes unacknowledged. Advertisers have the legitimate duty to bankrupt a network so brazen in it's disregard for the public. Bring. It. Down."
The Ayatollahs of Iran are free to spew death to America on TWTR but verified legitimate emails from Biden's son cannot be posted. Biden himself has not disputed the legitimacy of the emails.
you know that next earnings report the numbers are going to be worse because they're not getting subscribers back. It will continue to be a bleeding wound that will not close and eventually will be on life support. there is no future for this stock for a while! maybe never if a competitor takes their market share. they are probably done.
It's a $40 stock.

"Growth tech names like $ZM $TSLA $SNAP $PINS $SFIX $TWLO $NVDA $TWTR etc. selling off for a simple reason. Powell saying that when the economy returns to normal so will inflation. This leads to strong fundamentals growth (booming economy) but rising rate environment. Rising rates hit DCF discount rates on growth stocks (all of the aforementioned names have huge multiples). This means the highest multiple stocks start coming back to reality. I've been rolling back into my highest conviction names. As fundamentals show their strength, the market will likely get over the temporary valuation correction and re-rate growth names higher. I'm not going long value tech ($INTC or $FB or $AAPL), I'm going to stick to what works. Long $PINS and $SNAP more specifically."

"While Twitter, Amazon, Yahoo, Google, and Fakebook are busy censoring Americans that don't agree with their way of life, there are newer and better social media platforms springing up every year that don't accept the fake censor police. These older platforms that were once on top in the world will soon be just another face in the crowd."
Maybe Twitter can move its headquarter to Beijing to become a better communist propaganda machine and earn some reward from the communist CHYNA

No actual User growth imo. Less users with multiple accounts.
"If you own TWTR stocks, the flowing 4 issues should be paid attention: 1) general US economic condition specifically the trade agreement with China and the status in Venezuela. Both cases will be resolved in favor to US. 2) SMC regulation – to be honest, the impact of regulation to Twitter (even FB) is limited, 3) user growth – TWTR has approved in the last Q earning report that it’s user growth is not significant but will continue, 4) new applications – Since TWTR has done an outstanding job to clear the platform, we should expect more new applications in TWTR soon. TWTR stock is a BUY and it should reach $60 to $70 by the end of this year."
"All the bashers point to the stock price when making their posts. That's how much intelligence they can muster.If that's the extent of your logic, then I dedicate this meme to you - you truly deserve it."
"I just cancel my $FB, $TWTR accounts! They have no right to censor people's opinion ,they are following the communism regime!"
"Next week when this is trading at $30 people be sayin shoulda sold at 45, hehehehe"
"""Twitter is an open service that’s home to a world of diverse people, perspectives, ideas, and information"" That was right off of their web site. The facts are that Twitter has banned conservative points of view and now they are paying the price. Folks now have to guess just how low will the share price go????"
Sold my shares and no longer use TWTR or FB. this is bloated hot air.
i put a sell order at $150
Why people here like to predict prices.Nobody even made a correct guess.LOL
Never happy to see a stock go down with few exceptions guess what Twitter you are that exception.￼
Jack Dorsey for CEO of the year!!Man knows how to run a company.
"This stock may never recover, and if it does, it will take years."
Jack only cares about Communism and Soy. Twit investors are not even on his list.
All republicans like this post. Liberals dislike. I want to see the political majority of this board.
The latest covid 19 vaccination map closely follows the high school graduation rate. Not kidding. It also follows the Twitter account burning rate divergently. That’s a big mouthful for some here.
Dems plotting to crash the entire market now....they demand your fealty and submission....the demand you obey.....they're submitting legislation to burn all books they deem anti-state......with earmarks for more pronoun police.....
all aboard ?train is leaving soonbeep beep !
Buy at $51....
"Canada, Australia to coordinate efforts to make web giants pay for news...another negative news for tech stocks"

Straight to 27.00 with a dead cat bounce to 41$ After then dooooom. America wont support censorship. They are done.
"I canceled twtr, closed amazon and migrating from gmail now. It took me a few hours to cancel all of my amazon subscribe and save items. Last night I made my first online purchase I would have normally made using prime. I landed on Ace hardware for what I needed. It will be a little work to establish alternatives, but after a few months I should have new accounts setup to make shopping online as easy as it was with prime."
"Watch for the big institutional holders to start lowering their positions, they have secured a nice profit and won't let it slip to far before taking some profits."
Once we break 35 resistance level there is an air pocket all the way up to $45.
"Hey Dorsey....Shave, lose the nose ring, put down the soy latte, eat some meat, maybe take a shower, stop censoring 1/2 the user base and rethink your priorities."
Facebook announced that they have 2.8 billion daily users . I never used Facebook but I received 5 different messages saying that is me Facebook account.... I think  Twitter is doing something similar. FAKE ACCOUNTS for each adult in the world  
Yahoo keeps deleting my posts they will even delete this one..
One day FACEBOOK will go down as stone ! Don't buy BUBBLES
It couldn't happen to a nicer company. Bankruptcy in the cards?
"Wasn't Cohn on the $TWTR board part of why analysts thought there would be a better focus on return?Oooppsss, he just announced he is stepping down."
Twitter is vicious savage vitriolic hatred of the left 24 hours a day.
Twitter lost when they banned the 2nd greatest president in American History.
There will be no bottom. It’s gonna be a beautiful day/week/month(s). This is for your DJT. God bless you. God bless America.
Fifty one sixty three. And it’s still up more than 85 percent vs last year!
China red just like Twitter likes it.
Be patient
The market is 20% increased since 44.1 is out of office.
"Disney, Sales Force, mufti, fb. Nobody wanted at $19. Who wants it now?"
I'd like to express my deep gratitude to TWTR for making it possible to not hear what our most recent ex-Prez has to say about today's events.
$40 Billion for a website to make comments on and send those comments to subscribers? Wow TWTR investors might as well just throw their money into a Wood Chipper.
Why does CNBC continue to give LEFT a forum and air time?
I think WAPO and NY Times need to do a deep dive into Russia's funding of the NRA.
"$PINS, $SNAP up bigly!!! $TWTR up littlely. Wow, when the market speaks ... listen."
Dishonest company with a double standard. No sensible person can stomach it.
"I really do not understand TWTR shareholders. The performance of a company’s stock is the key metric to evaluate a CEO. To me the CEO has failed. I would think shareholders would be angry with Jack Dorsey (CEO) that the stock has underperformed and the business has languished. I am utterly bemused he has not been ousted. A CEO grows a business and should not be using it as his personal toy, soapbox whatever. Worse for the shareholders of TWTR, Dorsey has gone down a path where he is alienating half of the users of the company’s product. One would think Dorsey would welcome all to grow a business not shrink it. The wise CEO of any business never let’s his personal opinions be known, let alone effect in such a negative way the company he oversees prospects which are dimming. Remember though destroying TWTR would have no negative impact on his life because his core holdings lay with the other company he runs and seems to be engaged in favorably and is growing this business well. The company is Square.As a reminder, or as a PSA More of Mr. Dorsey's wealth is concentrated in the financial company Square. He owns about 13 percent of the company's outstanding shares, a holding worth about $4.9 billion as of Friday, while he controls about 2 percent of Twitter's outstanding shares, worth about $531 million.Now explain to me how TWTR shareholders continue to tolerate Dorsey’s destructive behavior.Good day all."
This stock used to be leading the way down when market is red. A couple players trying to change the rule. But it won't hold for long.
Couldn’t happen to a more deserved company. Sorry to those who are in the red. GLTA
I would gladly vote my shares for anyone who strives to increase shareholder value!
How is this still even over $40?!?
You got to love this stock $$$$$
This is the only stock I want to see end at zero because that is exactly what the liberals deserve.
"What a glorious morning to see Jack and his feckless TWTR plunging into oblivion. Let's see...TWTR deletes one of it's greatest user, despises half of the country and his followers, loses a huge part of it's customer base and the company expects this to be a solid business model? So, so nice to see this thing plummeting into the abyss and that homeless, creepy looking borderline pedo looking CEO Dorsey suffering financially this morning. Short the living hell out of TWTR and benefit for yourselves off this useless political platform's disgusting policy making disaster. Enjoy the plunge Jack!"
"""I tested positively toward negative, right? So no. I tested perfectly this morning, meaning I tested negative. But that's a way of saying it. Positively toward the negative."""
$35 today?
Huge beat.. $40 coming
"Hypocrisy: watching millennial ""conservatives"" whine and whine and whine about ""cancel culture"" and then calling for Liz Cheney's head because she dares to speak her mind. Agree or disagree, y'all are the biggest bunch of snowflakes. These are the people who have destroyed the party that I love. Hypersensitive sheep. I'll be fine, retiring in a few years and will spend my remaining years on a beach in the Keys. But America needs a real republican party to counter dem insanity. And you folks are destroying it."
A Twitter short is free money. Good for the soul too.
price targets ranging from 22 - 35. can anyone narrow this down with their crystal ball?
Democrats actively encouraging riots & violence. Fact. That's what TWTR represents.
Sell in May and go away No bottom in sight for TWATR
i bought 900k usd at 52.90$ thank you!!
Looks like it's more than just 80 million people leaving the platform. Other countries are already banning it and more are planning on banning the app in the future. This is a global wipeout of the company.
Easiest 3% gain in my life.
Only Free speech sites will survive . Many are dumping this for others that support the constitutions
BLM & AuntTeefUhh are both domestic terror organizations yet their accounts remain active? Short this junk into the ground.
It was only a matter of time. Just wait until next quarter which will be even worse. Numbers don't lie. Amazing how many people failed to realize how it takes a quarter before the numbers would reflect everyone who left twitter. I left and will never go back. This stock will soon be back down to 24 where it should be.
40's by end of week.
"HUGE BREAKING NEWS: Federal Judge Signals He May END Twitter’s Immunity in Dr. Shiva Case – Speech Police in Panic. Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, the man who invented email, ran for US Senate in Massachusetts as a Republican and made allegations of voter fraud on Twitter.

Good morning you communist share holders!!!! Just thought I'd drop in and tell ya that I can't wait for u to lose everything u have invested in this...ohhhh ya...have a great day.
Send this thing back to the communist scrapheap!
"Hope it would go to 24 before going back to 27 so I could got more cheaper shares, cheers!"
"Ouch, down once again. Are we heading to $50/share?"
What do you think about Twtr should I hold ?
46 tomorrow
"Dumped TWTR years ago: both the stock for modest gains and the insufferable online censorship biased ""service."" Really hate TWTR, its CEO, its policies, everything. Hope they go away soon forever. Glad they tanked. Anyone left supporting them as shareholders got what they deserve today."
From HERO to ZERO hahahhahahahahahhahah
Tomorrow shouldclose over $34.50
Nice scooped up some options for cheap
I need to start counting the number of times I hear tweeter everyday!! I know it is a lot more than Facebook!!! Twtr sp should be way Higher!!! Imho
This is looking Really BAD!! The Bottom is about Fall Out of TWATR!!
So glad to see this dump company take a hit and more to come. They know business is sinking since other businesses have left this liberal left wing CEO. I dropped my account and majority of friends have left Twitter as well. Bye Bye !!
TWTR Short sellers are American Heros.
TWTR CRASHING even though BOT GROWTH is thru the roof!!
Twitter has been arrogant. I expect the SP will continue to go down. Dorsey needs a big lesson.
"Dual Citizens in Congress? Sorry, that’s secret information."
Jack Dorsey says he believes in Free Speech! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Jack has snorted too much white stuff.
Going under 54
People will switch and buy through Twitter great news
Based on past and the projected earnings. TWTR is extremely overvalued with poor management. Any gains will be short lived. Expect a Major Sell off before the Election. wouldn't chance holding this with a Republican Win
I told ya'll last quarter's results were a one time thing. Never will twtr be able to make anything close to that again.
TIME TO START CONTACTING ATTORNEYS ABOUT THE FRAUD COMMITTED BY TWITTER!

Twitter misses are slow bleeds in after hours. And then unlike a lot of other companies they usually sink much lower the next day. This will be no exception.
Might be the day we finish up TODAY! Pinterest came all the way back!!

"It appears obvious to me that the Chinese have pressured all three (FB, GOOG, TWTR) —read Yahoo’s article this morning, “H&M Stores Vanish. . .” Dorsey might have been honest when he said he wanted free speech. The question is, is he able to have it and operate in China? Of course not. It’s time to break up Google, TWTR & FB—geographically and in the name of national security."
"Good grief, they aren't even giving court dates to the people crossing the border. Are we still a country?"
How did my order at $40 not get filled?!?! Sooo disappointed.
light volume drift since noon. the shorties did the same thing with SQ months back until they were run out of the mkt and the stock popped $25. take a longer term view and see the bigger picture. square is going to $125 unless it is bought out first.
$45 and change by the holiday. Check the charts on your own - obvious when support levels are factored in.Distinct H&S pattern.
I guess today was the beginning of the total collapse of this stock that so many were clamoring about over the weekend. I really hope they’re not serious investors without serious financial advisor/ planners. The T man is gone. Get over it. The world is turning without him just as Twitter lives on...
back to $16 bucks

Harry Boxer chart of the day - Twitter has room to run at $40.25 through to $50-$52
dont buy thinking share will go up.....this will keep going down due to the woke policy taken by management to destroy the self dignity of US citizen
sad
Facebook up to $195 today. Twitter could very easily get to $95. They have a lot going for it.
Twatter in the low 30's by July
Jack Just announced he’s stepping down
At this rate it will be 1.5 months till company closes doors.
"Australia, UK and now India may ban Twitter, Google, and Facebook for censorship"
Hey Jack... Why did you give BLM $10 Million of shareholders money?
Twitter a growth company with no growth.
this is not a meme stock guys. like it or not... this is about money...and this will go up soon.
will we see 53 today?
What a beautiful two day chart for America.
Keep going up

TWTR is being underestimated. The value of it's news platform can disrupt and enrich economy's through out the world in a single day. It is a major focal point of communication that will not fade away. Billions are lost and made in a single tweet. To have this much power in a news media and not recognize the potential value is surely a financial loss for many. See you at 80.00.
Sell twtr before it's down to 25
Twitter supports everything America doesn't want to be. Best communist stock in America.
"If you care about American freedom, buy WTR stock."
"TWTR employees support cancel culture. How sick. TWTR supports people who posts hate and violence on their app. Look at people like John McAfee a former big tech CEO. He can post anything he wishes and TWTR doesn't bat an eye against one of their own. He frequently posts about drugs, gun violence, and alcohol and yet you can follow him on TWTR."
"close to 70 mil in volume and 7% down, what a nice day. truly hope this thing looses most of its value."

Sell! Sell! Sell! The stock will continue to fall.
Bring the hate... $100 still on track
"LOL Y.commies removing my posts giving credit where its due(to Big Guy) for the Inflation,DisasterJobsReport,Gas shortage,Border Crisis,Virus Deaths,Middle East gone crazy,CompleteDestruction of the U.S.A. et cetera"
This stock will do well no matter what. If it goes under 45.00 (which I doubt) I will be scooping more up.
Finally
Guy Adami on Fast Money says TWTR going to $47.
"QUESTION- Is it an act of treason for a high ranking elected official to render financial assistance, encouragement and public endorsement of anarchists charged with the felonious crimes of rioting, the destruction of private and public property, looting and arson? On June 1, 2020 Vice President elect tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota.""In a few days Harris will be one heartbeat away from becoming the POTUS, which is a chilling reality. We the people must DO something about this dreadful situation. Immediately, contact your House Representative and insist that they draft articles of impeachment based upon Harris' own words. Please move from the stands of a message and join the fight that is being conducted on the field."

Does she need directions to the border?"
One or two more upgrades and this fly's to $40 in a heartbeat. Don't delay the time is now!
Still no PE for this....

Twitter is using new debt to pay the old debt with higher interest rates. A smart move save more money for the company and with the extras cash financing with low interest rate might use that to pay those debt in the future if they utilize that money to the fullest

"I think I'm going to exit all my TWTR positions. After scrolling through my (mostly right leaning) people I follow, many are reporting they are down 70k - 110k followers each day since this weekend. I suspect a mass exit for the door in the near future. It was great while it lasted!"

"This is going down to $20, possibly less."
Is the board unrest starting to make waves? Something else?
Pfizer and Moderna have dispensed vaccinations to 80 Million US citizens. There have been less than 3000 deaths or significant reactions leading to death. That’s .004% and to tweet that into perspective - odds of death by fall are .9%. Death by choking is .04%. Death by dog attack is .001%. So it’s somewhere between those last two.
$55 dollar stock. not selling a single share till it hits $55
Good news: down 17 percent in last month. Better news: this is STILL up 91 percent vs last year so tons of sellers with profits will be looking to exit.
I use to (total PAST TENSE) go to Twitter looking to buy stuff (NOT!). Is that what you mean Jack in the new direction? Business direction makes little sense.
I'm praying everybody buying puts and shorting this company makes enough money to donate to their local republican lawmaker. Remember guys to not only cancel any subscriptions you have but also deactivate your accounts so that they have a huge drop in users next quarter. Add me on parler @DropShock I will add you guys back and check out my posts.
"I don’t agree with Allred that the investigation into the Sussex claims are a distraction from Prince Andrew and his pizza express problems. Those investigations are well underway, properly funded, and appropriate pressure is being applied. Maxwell is in jail, and all she needs to do is roll over. Who cares if her hair is falling out and her toes are rotting from diabetes. She was the order procurer and processor. Once she confesses, then the interview with Prince Andy proceeds so that he can entrap himself."
I did a search for My Space and it brought me to this page.

"Twitter stock rises after Guggenheim hikes targetPublished: Apr 4, 2019 8:46 a.m. ET 0 ByEMILYBARYREPORTER Shares of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.93% are up 0.4% in morning trading Thursday after Guggenheim's Michael Morris raised his price target on the stock to $41 from $33 in a broader note about internet stocks. Morris also upgraded Facebook Inc.'s stock FB, +1.61% to buy from neutral and slashed his rating on Roku Inc. ROKU, -1.81% shares to neutral from buy. He said that Twitter, which saw its shares close Wednesday at $34.38, has been making progress on efforts to improve the user experience, and he sees room for further enhancements as the company experiments with new conversation tools and reply options. He also wrote that the U.S. election season can help drive increased usage and advertiser demand. Twitter's stock has climbed 15% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% has gained 13%."
Should close over $37 today. Target is over $40.
"There will be a massive offloading of Twitter shares today. The fall in share price will be faster than we've seen all week. Project Veritas has spilled the beans on Dorsey, and you can bet the institutions want out asap, while they can still save some of their investment. Get out people. It's going to hurt anyone caught up in this. If they won't buy your limit, make it a market sell, because that's probably how fast this is going to drop. When that happens the little man has no chance unless he gets out at market price."
Ouch! Are we heading to 50 by the end of March?

"Have no fear. The Fed and the Administration have their fingers on the pulse of the market. China's currency move changes everything. There is a downside limit that will be allowed. S&P 2,700 and we get another 35 bps is my call. I don't think it will come to that. I did put on a few shorts recently that are going to generate some real profit over next few days, but there is a limit to this downside in my opinion. And, TWTR is a name people want to own, and a business that is easily domiciled in the U.S., and thus shielded from tariff and currency risk."
Sell this stock quickly! Cut your losses...
The freaking earnings beat is rigged.The previous quarter was Est.0.184 Actual 0.38.Yesterday's was Est 0.004 Actual $0.16.How do you not beat an estimate so manipulatedly low? Based on Actual Twitter's earnings is less than half of the last quarter!! Better sell before the panic selling starts. This is GD rigged and should drop a lot a lot more.

I’ve been adding nonstop last two days. 145 million users every single day and growing. The advertisers and their dollars will follow. TWTR just needs to get their ad tech together and top/bottom line growth will be explosive.

I’m not a shareholder but Jack is the wrong guy for this company. 2020 was made for Twitter but he failed to fuel its growth.
"Never thought I would have agreed more with CNBC's analsyis, but after hearing ""Is Twitter A Buy After Earnings?"" It makes perfect sense to continue to hold long. TWTR is really cleaning up their acts thru Jack and the operating expenses / investments they will need to make to get the environment healthy and engage speaks very clearly for investors that TWTR means serious business to thrive. Maybe even to clean themselves up to the point of offering to sell themselves at a higher value while Jack focuses on SQ? Thoughts?"

The Thousands Prosecuted that stand trial for their culpability. We will teach our children songs, to make fun of traitors, to make catchy rhymes. Eventually there will be cards, gifts, drinks, tweets, e gifts, Facebook memes to share. Traitor Day, like Xmas, will be a new tradition. And for those who brought it to us, they and their families will live the scorn and finger pointing of generations. Orange smears on their lives."
TWTR is one of the greatest tools for news and information.. The fact the news and companies say “ Follow me on TWTR” Shows you the power of the company..... Go Longs!

Twitter is non stop hate 24 hours a day. Cancel it.
"Am I alone in thinking I really had a sure thing here? I missed tremendous opportunities elsewhere by going overweight in this. I really believed in a user quality narrative for Twitter over all social media. I really believe this is the one company that will be here in a decade, and I believe this is also replacing not just other social media, but all media as the primary source of corporate, government, celebrity, and breaking news."
Now even more glad I sold my $TWTR end of Dec for some great gains as looks like it's going to be cyptonite to own it going forward. Going to now look at unloading my $FB as well. #timber

Any know the reason for this sell-off?
I tried to buy & hold for after election!
Love to watch the slide. The hivemind is dying. All of the little commie investors in this company. Are getting a hard lesson in capitalism. They love to protest and cancel so long as it does not affect their pocketbook. Their virtue signaling and embrace of cancel culture is starting to backfire. Way too many free aps out there way better than this liberal echo chamber.

"Stormy weather ahead for TWTR! MyPillow founder Mike Lindell has announced a new social media app, VOCL. VOCL is an acronym, standing for Voices Of Free Speech (?). It does not, I repeat not, stand for VOluntarily CeLibate. Ok, it's logo is hideous, and it's been hit by a copyright infringement notice immediately. It also equates disinformation with free speech. But, really, this could be the death knell of twitter!"
Looks like 28 bottom holds strong will see tomororw if this is true
I am looking forward to the coming months with Twitter.
Wow! Just how low will it go?

Does anyone know which metrics twitter reports. I have uninstalled twitter on 3 of my android apps. hopefully they know that. I still access my account via the web and I haven't de-activated my account just yet because I do like to follow a little bit of sports news.is de-activating my account useful.. or is the lack of use enough.
"In order to understand why $SNAP is trading where it's trading (valuation wise), we have to understand the story and the long-term picture. Here it is (from a bullish perspective: $SNAP delivers comparable ad ROI returns to that of $FB and gets similar ARPU grab to $FB (~$45-$50/DAU annually). Keep in mind, $SNAP will likely drive far more advertiser value than $TWTR long-term while $TWTR is already monetizing at $16-$17/DAU annually.In addition, $SNAP continues to expand its international use as the rebuilt Android design draw in the international crowd. Keep in mind that $SNAP is still early-innings in many of these international markets, so there is a lot of room for expansion. So, let's value $SNAP. What's it really worth. Well, to understand that, let's try to think about where the business will be in a decade. Here are the numbers behind the narrative:- ARPU of $45- DAUs of 500mln- Revenue of $22.5bln- 87% gross margins ($6 of CoRPU, mostly infrastructure/revenue share, and content creation costs)- ~$6 billion in OpEx (vs. ~$2.2B in 2020)On the current share count of ~1.5B shares, 2030 $SNAP is doing ~$9/share in EPS. Assuming a 4% earnings yield (basically 25x earnings) for a high margin, high growth tech business, which is roughly in line with present-day $FB, then $SNAP can be worth ~$225/share in 2030. Discounting back at ~7%/year (low rate environment, moderating equity beta, low ERP) I'm at a 2022 year end PT of ~$125/share."
Don’t worry. Intraday pops don’t matter. Twitter won’t finish in the green for days or weeks.
buh-bye 30s
I am issuing strong sell call on this enemy of freedom and putting $15 target.

"TWTR is an under valued stock now, after %20 down from last week solid earning. Big institutions are adding here !"
"(Twitter): A lot of folks weren't happy with Twitter's Q4 earnings report last week. I'm not one of those people.Twitter stock is still up slightly since the year began, but has fallen 12% since reporting earnings last week. Mostly, this is because Twitter announced weaker-than-expected sales guidance, and a smaller-than-expected number of monetizable daily active users (mDAU) for its service. But from my perspective, the fact that Twitter is purging fake and bot Twitter accounts from its rolls, and zeroing in on tracking the growth of its most active customers, does two good things.First, it focuses the company's (and investors') attention on Twitter's most profitable accounts. And second, it resets growth expectations to focus on a much smaller base -- that subset of total accounts, which can now presumably grow at a faster pace.Now, analysts haven't yet had a chance to reset their expectations for Twitter's growth, and are still calling for Twitter to grow earnings at about 19%. This suggests that Twitter stock at 19 times earnings is only fairly valued at present. If the company ends up growing faster than 19%, however (as I think possible), then the stock could arguably be cheaper than it looks.That makes right now -- early February and right after the post-earnings sell-off -- a great time to buy Twitter stock.This winner has been dragged down by other players"

This company along with fb will eventually go down in flames. You just cannot have a large entity rule America with a one sided view.
Will likely test next resistance point. Not even a dead cat for bagholders!
Remember the sticking point: $52.40. It breaks and it is a race into the 40s easy.
Trying to shut down users you don't agree with is not going to work as a business plan going forward. Time to start looking at some of these companies as monopolies and heavily regulate them.
"Motley fool just panned the stock. I think its interesting that such a large TECH GIANT well established and its still not turning a profit. Operating expenses seem to be going up faster than revenue. What is really strange is that this company should be like a lot of other digitally delivered goods and should see profit margins ramp up as revenues scale up. As the company grows their cost should drop as a percent of sales. Now for years AMZN didn't show a profit but that was because they were largely taking profits, stock sales, and loans and reinvesting in their business big time. But I have no clue what grand plan Twitter is working on. It is pretty much the same basic limited app it has always been. Ooooohh we can type more letters now. This one is over rated."
"Is it a shame that NK's last missile launch over the Japanese archipelago was September 15, 2017? Do you miss the threats to Japan? Would it make you feel more comfortable if they resume?"
"Banning individuals and denying free speech by $TWTR $GOOG $APPL $FB will not be tolerated. It is the surest sign that big tech needs to be broken up. Consolidation and concentration of any type of power (power, money, influence) inevitably lead to abuse of that power. Ironic that GOOGs first motto was ""do no evil."" They may all think they are too big to fail. I guess that depends on how you define ""fail."" In my opinion, they just did."
Twitter “we haven’t made any money but we increased users who can make us money.. but we aren’t making money though”
Why do people invest in companies that don't manufacture a product and only sell their users information to advertisers for profit?
twtr has made me so much money. mainly shorting it!!!
"No, it's a BOOOOOOYAAAAAA"
"For the bullish zealots and bearish zealots, a simple poll. If you are in the middle, no need to vote.Earnings date: 29 Apr 21Thumbs up if $TWTR will be $75 or more at the end of the first week after earningsThumbs down if $TWTR will be $50 or less at the end of the first week after earningsIt is the BULLS vs. the BEARS. Have at it!"
"RED??? Giving up all that morning gained so quickly! Holding strong for $60, GLTA!"

"what do we need twitter for anyway. we are exposed to boots and propaganda and can get fired for a post someone find offensive years later. AND they mine our data and it gets leaked, sold, and/or hacked.what is the upside?"
"On Thursday, The Detroit News endorsed Republican John James over incumbent Democrat Gary Peters for U.S. Senate. It appears that Twitter isn’t too happy about this endorsement and is warning users who attempt to share it that headlines “don’t tell the full story.” The platform suggests that users read the article before they retweet it."
soon this little bird is turning into a Phoenix !
Conservatives just CANCLE Twitter and short it !Enjoy some liberals cash
"Parler, the Leper Colony of social media. It's where all the derelicts and social misfits congregate."
"As TWTR executives figures this out, the money making part of the social internet connection. You witness the Jeff Bezos using this Twitter Tool, as well as the Leader of the USA, as well as everyone you know. The current Twitter corporate executives have finally figured out how to monitise it."
"Computer algorithms trigger selling when a perceived negative headline is released. Our Great President Trump is not going to give up his valuable real estate on Twitter. He has 62,000,000 followers. He will continue to Tweet the Truth and fight for America. Now to the quarter that ends Sunday. It’s going to be exceptional."

Sold my stock and discontinued my Twitler account. Are they still in business?
wow wow wow wow
They slowed the Dump so they can create the maximum amount of New Bagholders over 50 with NAZ futures Tanking
"Thanks to yahoo! banning thousands of everyday, common words used in conversation, Webbsters will have to add hundreds of pages of new entries into their dictionary to account for the slew of alternate spellings employed to get around the word police on this hole mb."
Since TWTR became the go to social media site for liberal trash  $80 to $57 and falling. Twatter was $70+ over 7 years ago on its IPO day. Nice investment.
"Twitter's mission statement:The mission we serve as Twitter, Inc. is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers. Our business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve – and do not detract from – a free and global conversation.Everyone? Really? Everyone except for the POTUS and others associated with him?Notice that Twitter's claim that business and revenue will always follow that mission in ways that improve - and do not detract from - a free and global conversation.So they have just thrown their business model out of the window.Since this company doesn't turn a profit, spends money all kinds of ways, doesn't even really have a mission statement that they are abiding by, why not just dump it?Why do you think there is anything here moving forward?"

I bought Twitter last week at 48.96￼. I Remember on CNBC the analysts said Twitter is a. Great buy @ 52 so I’m looking pretty good aren’t I?￼
"looks like the democrat fake pump here at TWTR is over, and reality will be setting in, that banning the worlds most popular user will be having grave financial side effects.oh well."
"If you don't like Twitter, wouldn't it be better to flip it for money than to just hope for bankruptcy? i dont like FB so i trade it sometimes to take their money."
Back to $70 next week!

I vote to ban Dosey from Twtr.
"Highest approval rating, S&P hitting new highs, prosperity through the land, vaccinations booming, reopening, and oh, the grievance committee is noisy because Twitter is down. Nvda is as down a couple weeks ago. Tsla was down a couple weeks before. I’m not sure the grievance committee is relevant, but they sure are old and cranky for a bunch of 40K a year mutts. The subsistence level in the US is slightly below, so can see why these low class low info folks are worried about a rise in the minimum."
Is it possible this thing will go back down to 20 or lower?

"You will see 3 times earnings beat, and the rest will be history"
Citron upgrade is just one of the many to follow. Shorts are running scared and will likely to cover within the next few days resulting in TWTR stock going up up and up... $50 is around the corner.
nice...down on an up day
Twitter going down. Big time
"Dorsey should be sued personally for creating an atmosphere that allows triggered employees to censor and throw off users based on their whims, it destroys fairness and is against the shareholders by limiting growth- the whole house needs to cleaned out- are you listening Elliot?"
There is NEVER a bottom after twitter misses.
"TWTR may not be good at making money, but it is far and away the best vehicle for MAGA mockery. It think it could qualify for 501(c)3 status as a public service organization."
Encouraging to see strong support at 31...let's hope it holds. The market is in free fall and we're hanging in there.
Cathie Wood must be real proud of her dart throwing. She bought like $200 million more Twitter at $58 about 10 days ago. Impeccable timing for a crazy lady.
I bet the business owners in Portland would like a little of the razor wire fencing they have around the DC Capital to put up around their own businesses.

"TWTR new highs soon. lol this board is comical, taken over by paid teenager call center Bears."
Twitter is going to lose 100's of millions in its upcoming libel cases...
"“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"

GF couldent understand why I was in such a cheerful mood last night. thank you twitter! may communism die
TrumpsNewSite has everything TWTR would have but it looks better. I cant wait until he builds it out for us to get accounts!!
Twitter is a cesspool echo-chamber and everyone's lives would improve if it was gone. It is a firehose of negative musings and a month after deleting the app you'll feel better. Do it.
"Love it.....hopefully it skims past 40, 30, and 20 on its way to a big fat goose egg"

"Congratulations to all longs! Many of us have made a lot money TWTR. My advice to longs is that if you sell it you may buy a new car; however it you sell it ten years from now, you may buy an airplane."
Finally sold all my Twitter. I got tired of all this company’s BS and think downward spiral will justifiably continue. Adios
This wingless Twatter Bird has one talent: Doing dead cat bounces.We'll see how well it bounces after falling off a cliff next week.

"Yeah, users are gonna pay admission to hear woke nonsense...good plan!"
"Green at close no matter what overall market does....gonna still call it Twatter because it is still my most frustrating holding. But, I will NEVER sell."
Let's squeeze SHORTIES like lemon.
Lol Twitter go to 80$ 
"Didn’t get to $34, however very strong today."
I would not want to be short in this one tomorrow
"I am actually a little shocked it broke thru the $52.40 support level. If it bobs back up tomorrow, this was a one-day sell-off because of the Citi prose on FB and such.If not, TWATR may need a stock price parachute."
You investors in Twitter stock need to see the writing on the wall. Stock may be artificially held up but not for long. People ( Democrats and Republicans) that believe in free speech are leaving. There is no hope. Stock will be 20 by the end of February.

I already bought TWTR, NFLX.I bought 1000 shares of CMCSA (Comcast) when the Analysts were saying to avoid CMCSA because of their bid to Fox assets and willing to pay 65 Billion Dollars.No one knows a thing, just do your own research and buy the company if you like it and if you don't move on and stop BLA BLA telling people where NFLX stock will be next week, next month or next year."
"Donald J. Trump1:01pm April 30, 2021Twitter stock “plunged” as results are no longer cutting it for investors. Shares are off 15% today. Bad forecasts are hurting the outlook but more importantly, in my opinion, it has become totally BORING as people flock to leave the site. Michael Nathanson stated, “the math doesn’t make sense” as he lowered his price target. I guess that’s what happens when you go against FREEDOM OF SPEECH! It will happen to others also."

I havent been on Twitter in months and its not because I'm boycotting it.I almost forgot that it even existed without the Real PrezDJT reminding me everyday.

"Soon the hypersensitive snowflakes who spend their days bashing a social media company (which I neither like or hate) will drift off, their irrational hate only equaled only by their truly remarkable hypocrisy. They will hate as they buy their toothpaste from Amazon, forward their rants on Gmail and use their iPhones - all companies led by ""woke"" execs. Either be a REAL conservative or don't. And y'all are phony. To the core."
Who can say this is a surprise?After Twitter went into politics this was meant to happen.It's not a good business to lose millions of customers.
I bet the people of Twitter are bent out of shape this morning that the border agents didn't let the Yemeni terrorist cross the line into America. Twitters probably full of tears this morning.
$52..$51..$50.. This getting UGLY!!
Millions of users are cancelling their accounts. We are also see competition in this space. If it keeps dropping will they be forced to reduce headcount?
When they ban people because they don't like them it's going down. Facebook is next.

I have been in sales my whole life. One thing that is a constant is that people do not buy from a company they do not like and do not trust. they might make it in communist China but they will not make it here they are done they broke both of the above rules.
"Now, I do admit $SNAP is mostly saturated domestically and in Europe in terms of usage. The real user growth opportunity is going to come from international (think Mexico, East Asia, Latin America, etc.) where purchasing power is lower, but Android is the predominant mobile operating system. In $SNAP's Analyst Day event they highlight the ways they are going to sustain strong engagement. At this point in time, $SNAP has differentiated itself enough from the competition that the risk of competition grabbing users is likely minimal. It's happened before, but $SNAP's platform has grown and evolved since then, adding new, entrenching features to retain and add users. In addition, because of it's privacy-centric and content-moderation lite structure, $SNAP will not incur costs that a $FB or $TWTR would from content moderation, meaning their operating margins could actually be much higher long-term than anything $FB or $TWTR is doing. At the end of the day, I'm focused on the long-term of this company. The biggest concern about this company is it's valuation. And believe me, I understand the concern. At ~15.7x '22 revenue, it's not cheap. Or is it? Let me break down my valuation for this business, and why it could generate so much more in returns than $FB or $TWTR."
Democrat supremacy is much worse than white supremacy. know the new trend in racism and sell the stock representing it.
Cheapest big tech company
Ouch! Now down 5%. Rumor is that millions of accounts have left and moved to Parler and others? Investors now need to calculate just how low will it go.

"I think it would be helpful to get a guide on this Maricoping thing going on with the database. The level of perjuring, libel, misrepresentation of fact, and disgust with what is being sold as an audit is disenfranchising anyone with a voter registration on the gop of Arizona. Let’s face it, the misguided tweets, acrimonious statements and releases, and outright backtracking of stories is a mockery of a process already done 3 times. Enough is enough. There is zero legitimacy unless this is done by a credentialed company. I’d like an explanation, point by point, from the conspirators here, explaining their fealty towards this “audit”. What is it about it, that gives you purpose?"
April 29th will be interesting. Thoughts?
It amazes me how the SEC allows Andrew Left to go short and then put out a tweet saying TWTR is going to 20 calling it the Harvey Wienstien of social media. Market manipulation at its finest.

"GRIPER, or whatever the Trumpy app will be called (if it ever happens), will be a unsavory place where people come purely to complain. It will serve a useful social function as a containment zone for semi-literate grievance rants, but will be wildly unattractive to normal, common sense Americans. It will barely register as any type of business threat to TWTR or the other established mainstream social apps."
I'm do not support the Viking invasion of the Capitol...but taking away freedom of speech is WRONG! Short this to Zero...
This has not found a bottom.
Big investors buying. Looking for more seats on the board? Can only be good since it recently has been quite bad. Should at least get a short term bounce according to options.
Strong buying opportunity at this low level.
I mean seriously anyone losing big money here and over the next four years. What were you all thinking anyway. There is no Capital Markets and Wealth from Capital Markets in Socialism the profits go to the people. The TWTR Marxist and communistic socialist societies must suppress views other then their owns to succeed. You're wealth lost in TWTR will only be transferred to those leff fortunate. All capital markets are doomed in ones controlled by socialists. We know this thus why are you here? Why are you even invested in any of these bloated equity stock issues that can't survive in Socialism .
"I used to think Twitter was a good investment but I’m out from even watching it and today proved it. I’m not a short or even a holder never bought this. My gut opinion is this. E-commerce companies where you order things,Jumia amazon, wish etc.they will start there own social media. They have already started.this Twitter, Facebook, companies like these are dying. In the future they will be obsolete or bought out. Remember these words, in 5-10 years let’s see what happens"
TWTR will decide which first amendment rights you are allowed to practice......

"“Go woke, go broke”"
"I hope I'm wrong, but it seems as if late anyone viewing the stock popping before earnings actually went down after announcement. Amazon, Goog all had the same feelings.. whereas Appl and Fb had such a pessismistic outlook, actually shot up on earnings day. It seems everyone here, including the analysts covering, have a good outlook on Twtr.. so hopefully TWTR will continue to go up.."
Tweeter has a EPS of -(Negative) 1.58 its a ponzi stock!
"Have to agree with Kramer that this was an overreaction by the markets. Twitter isnt going anywhere and is going to only get bigger and better.My feeling is that this is great opportunity to buy before a run back up or s buyout offer is forthcoming at $50 a share. That would be cheap, in my opinion."
"DAU was up 11%. That’s pretty strong for seven straight quarters. Twitter is a real-time platform that people are going there for news as it's happening, sports as it's happening, culture as it's happening."
"$55..$54..$53..$52..$51.. in less than 1 day?? Wow at this rate TWATR will be ""ZERO"" in a couple of weeks!!"
Both a new 52 week high today and a 2 year closing high! Giddy up!
Think we close above 33 ! Friday I expect upgrades on the stock.
When TWTR doesn't like what you say--they mute you. Some social media platform that is. I hope the company stock price gets hit.
"C'mon Twitter... get your act together. You a huge reach with lots of platform and app integration, you are a go-to for real-time events, and you have been around forever and a day. You can do better."

A close over 35 will be extremely bullish. There is still a big air gap up with next resistance at 45 after the 35 finally breaks.
meanwhile back at Twitter HQ jack is storming up new ideas
ANOTHER record HIGH for stock market!!
At least TWITLER is gone. God bless all.

"TWTR is predicted to drop over $20 per share.Lohr Interests, beginning to short TWTR as per Matt Lohr."
"$45 and change by the holiday. ""Sell in May and Go Away""Is it the negative EPS what attracts longs or the continually promise of a sustainable business model?"
"What a very nice day for $TWTR longs to oscillate to the north. It has been a wild Mr. Toad's ride up and down. Remember, the company Q4 earnings press release predicted a 2021 Q1 loss (it was a quote). Protecting a gain long or short is never a bad call."
Just bought more $FB and $TWTR - as always ”Stay Long stay Strong” Good luck all Longs!!
"Twitter down 13 % ! (Go ban Colin Kaepernick,Lebron James ,Jemele Hill,and Shaise Manza Young from your website-maybe you'll do better)"
biden....American laughing toy......
Dorsey is beginning to look like Howard Hughes right before he took a swan dive from reality and dove off the deep end.
Tons of stocks are up today. You know what isn’t?! Lololol. I love this so much.
Cathie bought

Good evening Patriot. Down with yogurt slurping Jack and his cronie librats!
It’s 2:10 pm. You know what means?!?!TIME FOR THIS BIRD TO FADE. TO. CLOSE.
Is TWTR as Anti Semetic as the Demcoms?? They are practically one in the same so..
Deleted Files have been Recovered!! Uh Oh Demcoms!!
Twitter now has 2 severe child sex trafficking lawsuits and 1 constitutional lawsuit of note. Doesn't need the removal of 230 at all. They play fast and loose. Images of children getting sexually abused no problem. US President or Conservatives trying to communicate with the country gets censored.Twitter makes the Left look criminal.
Stocks are starting to use TWTR to announce earnings are out TWTR is being used for everything
"Love it!! Let it fall, fall!!! I hope Coke follows Twittledum...down the tube!"
"The fact is, a lot of people view drug addiction as a reason to devalue the very lives of fellow human beingsAnd that’s why I’m glad Limbaugh is dead and con-splaining to the devil right now why he needs a bigger desk."

somebody is working this......
"For the life of me I can think of no better investment as the weather warms, folk get back to work, inflation rises, interest rates increase than Social Media stock!!! Congratulations to like minded folk."
"Hey my white privilege card doesn’t work I can’t get anything for free like college education, handouts or released from prison￼ if i ever went there."
The failings of FB are going to add fuel to TWTR’s rocket after successful earnings. A lot of FB money will be ploughed into this stock.
"""Given our evolving business and the businesses Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey are in, it has become increasingly difficult for them to avoid conflicts relating to board matters, and they are not standing for re-election,"" Disney said in a statement."

Napoleon and the Hungarian have now stopped pumping which means you should be dumping immediately.

Deserves to be 0
LMAO. Just as I've predicted last week! Below $70 then below $60 at the end of this week! LMAO to the bank!
I listen to Cramer and do the opposite working out great thanks God i finally found the right strategy.
"The real issue is that twitter has a large number of accounts which are just not engaging. So, on surface it shows users but they are sleeper and have been discouraged by twitter to the point, they don't even log into service."
"What are you waiting for ?Boycott Twitter ,Cancel your Twitter accountShort Twitter !"
the best thing that you can do in life is buy and hold before earning.... hold through earnings... you will be happy
Buy more Twitter shares? Yes ! Only to SHORT!! The greatest Twitter account in HISTORY was banned today￼! And So go those 88 million followers. They are going to PARLER.
I am loving this.
51.76 heed the warning at close
3.1 million buys. Someone is taking a very large risk!
I would rather own SNAP. Jack Dorsey is nothing more than a liberal hack!
Facebook US attorney probe is dragging this down.. perfect time to buy before earnings.
I think news is coming out at the close.
That’s what you get for alienating half of this country. Net loss for 2020. Should have stayed out of politics.
"So let me get this straight.... $TWTR cleans up their platform and removes many of the spam and bot accounts, and then shares plummet 25% due to the decline in active users?? whatta joke... not many better buy now opportunities for the long run than Twitter"
Justice is done!
No surprise it's big institutions that are keeping the share price up
just confirm leaking out one of big share holder will unload 50% there share...I am ready short by Monday
Twitter is a 40 billion USD company . Has room
Bad couple days for the good guys. Good couple days for the commie bull chasers.
BANK OF AMERICA still has a rating of underperform and Has SQ as Neutral. Good thing I don't follow their advice.
"Twitter, the voice of America’s transexual socialists!"
60$ in 2 days
Ouch! Down once again. Just how low will it go?
Congrats longs shorts got smoked and I watched thinking i can short but it’s way to strong to mess with. Hope it runs up even higher
"Go woke, go broke."
Let’s get that first close in 52s in months. Then we can work our way down into 40s. One step at a time my fellow Americans.
50 day mov ave moving through the 200 day......................rocketship..............
Twitter is nothing but a leftist echo chamber with fake accounts. Get out of this stock before it crashes. They are not hiding Joe for giggles. He is impaired. Soon the market may crash. There is not enough cash to pay off the masses like they are trying to do.
TWTR fell as a side effect of behemoth FB's fall. There is nothing wrong with earnings. Almost every world leader uses Twitter. I believe its a matter of patience then stock will pick up again. My instinct is 40 within a month. This is being conservative.
"If this falls $5 today, I am cracking open champagne."
I try not to anthropomorphize the market. But it definitely doesn't vote GOP.
"Washington, DC (April 8, 2021) – The National Center on Sexual Exploitation Law Center (NCOSE), The Haba Law Firm, and The Matiasic Firm are suing Twitter on behalf of a second survivor of child sexual abuse who was trafficked on the social media platform."
"Sinking ship is about to crack 50 in a big way. This is a 5 dollar stock. any social media company that supports censorship and communism then alienates over half of its subscribers and with its big Tech allies tries to rub it in their faces promote bogus ""insurrection "" theories and supports politicians in a one side manner deserves the gutter where it's headed. Next will be Facebook. I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg original Partners he cheated will laugh in his Facebook when it hits the skids next. it won't happen tomorrow it will take a while but they are going down!"
Twitter is my best performing stock in 2021. I picked up some shares in early January 2021 when it was at $45/share. Goldman and other firms made price target upgrades on Twitter recently.
"ya boy gon have to short twitter today, on foe nem. twitter got everyone down bad so might as well short it yanumsayn"
Earnings!
Twitter chose democracy and now Georgia and majority of corporations are choosing democracy overbecoming a marxist dictatorship.
Big volumes today
green
Imagine trading on emotion.
this news fundamentally isnt any plausible reason for pump. all they are saying is that they will increase revenue by adding more features. how do you know some other app might come out and eat up market share? how do you know the added features will add new users as they say? instagram created that feature thats similar to tiktok that didnt boost fb price sky high like this? i think people are ganging up in here because theyre tired of the market managers turning february into an extremely bearish month.
Remember TWTR was added to the S&P so I bet the big funds will buy into this discount. TWTR will close down under $2 down today and back up next week...
This is the golden opportunity to buy at this very low level.
"Feeling that twtr will get upgraded this week, earnings were fine, it’s about ad dollars and revenue! It’s a useful platform and a well known national brand."
america fought the third reich in 1940s only to lose to these enemies within.

Wow!Twitter has new numbers today!POTUS46 has 5.4 millions followers. POTUS45 archived account has 33.3 millions followers so 50 millions have left Twitter in 2 weeks.
We haven't heard from Debra today. I like to hear from Debra and then watch the stock collapse.
"From the Goldman price upgrade:""But some traders think the rally has gone too far. ""The problem is, on a technical basis, it's also getting incredibly overbought,"" Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, told CNBC on Thursday.He noted that the last time the stock's relative strength index moved this high, in mid-2018, Twitter plummeted about 40% in less than six months."""
"So in the last 2 days Vanguard Group, Morgan Stanley and Black Rock all filed SC13G/A filings 5% plus acquisitions in Twitter. The bottom is in and longs will be rewarded. Rome was not built in a day. Good Luck.. live long and prosper TWTR longs! SC 13G >= 5% Acquisition 2/13/2019 SC 13G/A >= 5% Acquisition 2/11/2019 •SC 13G >= 5% Acquisition 2/11/2019"
"I must say that I really expected a reversal today. I thought this was an overreaction to the most honest CEO in the business. My Twitter use is simply as a reader. I scan it daily. I have never Tweeted. I think most are like me, and this space is regarded as the realm of celebrities and politicians. But, our eyeballs are there, even if we are not ""active users"" who post."
this company has never made money is not a growth company. We get banned in several countries. Not looking good!
"Twitter’s prospects: Exponential growth internationally, new shopping and event features, post-pandemic media resuming."
Thanks for the dippies boys
"is twitter deliberately trying to hurt shareholders?""Twitter suspends politician for saying men can't give birth"""
Concerted effort to drive this down.. The 25 day mean is 41.50 to which it should revert to at the very least . Good news is that as it has fallen so much in the past 30 days it has more room to run up post earnings..

Twitter is a market darling again!!
Back to 30+?
Second time posting. Will someone tell Joe that the top 1 percent already pay 39 percent of the taxes and the bottom 90 percent pay 29 percent. These are numbers from the Feds not mine. They tried the ssme thing in France and a lot of the rich packed up and moved to Germany. Yahoo you can delete it again and I'll keep reposting it so don't waste your time.
Has the possibility occurred to anyone that Noto is moving on to take a very promising CEO position now because the terms for a TWTR take over has already be negotiated?? I believe that is a distinct possibility. I don't think he would leave if terms were not already agreed upon. Just a thought!
it's down
Second time posting. The left wants the voting age lowered to 16 while they are brainwashed by their teachers.
OMG! Are you taking advantage of these free trade alerts? If not there literally has to be something wrong with you. go to (http://Pick-stocks.com) now.
"Twitter reported a loss of $7.44 Million in March, but at the same time handed $10 Million to BLM. Can anyone explain that? How can you allow these reckless people to handle your money. You got no dividend, Twitter reported a loss, but BLM got handed $10 Million."
Looks like the good guys are never gonna see a close in the 40s. I don’t get it. This is still up 80 percent in a year. Hopefully this turns back red.
PV lawsuit taking more $$ out of Twits pockets. PV has never lost a lawsuit. They are filing a lawsuit against CNN tomorrow...fingers caught in the cookie jar.
"Meanwhile, the GOP Twitter account posted: ""50 days in office, and Pres. Biden still hasn't held a press conference. Americans deserve answers on our border crisis, continued school closures, & his job-killing energy agenda."""
"Just drop $20 tomorrow, get back to the $30's and tread water there for a year or two AND BE DONE WITH IT."
No .... twtr down because of market conditions . Just pointing out China trade has very little to do with our economy .
"just to bring some clearance from a russian citizen. Twitter in Russia is one of few free speech platforms and as a result it's the main platform along with youtube for opposition leaders to communicate with their followers. twitter is very very very anti government and people criticize Putin and his government on it. obviously it angers the dictator and he is looking for ways to ban it, they are using child pornography as an excuse. I personally have never seen child pornography on twitter lol. this is a plain and simple attempt to censor free speech in an authoritarian country."
Possibly gap up tomorrow at open
"Hate to tell you Twitter, BUT there are only TWO genders, male & female. Everyone else needs to be put in a straight jacket . Get “woke”, go broke. TWTR $80 to $55, and BTW it was $75 in 2013 on its IPO day, no splits or anything since. Jack Dorsey may want to mix in a shower ."
Liberal oligarch policies never good for shareholders.
roses are red. fingers are crossed. twitter is reporting in 1minute. and your money will be lost
"Well I don't live in the US and I don't really have a preference for Democrat or Republican leadership as an investor both of them have their good and bad sides. How ever as far as twitter goes, you have to wonder which opinions will be deemed unacceptable next and will start facing censorship."
"Oh no, the Dow is down for the 4th consecutive day. Looks like Sleepy Joe has awakened the long hibernating Bear Market with his ill advised executive orders. A MAJOR market correction is just around the corner, especially for seriously inflated tech stocks like Twitter."

Wow this America Laster is literally destroying this country!!

This will go back to 45

LOL people are leaving in drovesand they are going to start charging to tweetLMAO
"To grow users, Twitter needs to launch live video game streaming to their service. They already have Periscope to launch it from. Definitely, they need an online betting platform for any live events. They also need photo and video sharing service. They need to launch these right now."
"bought this back in 2013 for 41, nice to finally see some green!"
BACK TO $60.00 NEXT WEEK.
"According to Trumpies, Jack Dorsey (capitalist entrepreneur billionaire) and Mitt Romney (hedge fund manager/venture capitalist/Republican presidential nominee) are communists. According to Trumpies, Twitter stock will plunge to single digits due to MyPillow guy's dominance in the social media market. According to Trumpies, their guy ""won by a lot"". According to the common sense majority, lol."

Disney will acquire 30% of Twitter soon will be announced also that will kickstart the interest of others and might led to buying out of Twitter.

Blood in the water. Time to buy!!!
"So now Twitter, Facebook decide it's time to meddle in the 2020 election and they make it public knowledge. Brownshirts are at it again."
Dont like Twitter but that purchase from Cathy is Bullish for an Options Trade tbh
"Some say ""Bigo"" Barnett has 20 million followers on his twitter account. That's why Trumpsters should be buying twtr."
Those Twatters at Elliot Investment Management are real geniuses.
Should be $34+ today.
Obama says buy Solyndra.
A very smart liberal friend of mine who enjoyed leaving negative replies to Trumps tweets said Twitter is violating his constitutional right to communicate with his government. Think about that- censorship cuts both ways. Wasn't it after all a court that ruled Trump cant ban people from his twitter because it violates their constitutional rights?
Jack Dorsey maybe the riches drug attic that is in the public view.
I will do everything in my power this year to get my friends to move to another conservative alternative from Twitter and FB. Their censorship is outrageous.
19 cents more and will be past resistance. Looking for a strong run today.
I'm only here to hear Russian accents bleed through words

TWTR easily moves to $50+ So many avenues to make money. i wouldnt entertain a buyout unless its 100+
Meh. $40 stock.
We survived the 80s and 90s without Facebook and Twitter. I’m we’ll survive without this unnecessary social bias platform.
"twtr is still the voice of freedom and truth and in the mean time,almost 21% of the gop is still pumping marxist propaganda and hate speech that representswhite nationalists."
ARK BUYS EVEN MORE TWTR TODAY 
"Twitter needs to revamp the ""verified user"" system by allowing anyone who sets up a real, personal account to become verified. Verified users should then be able to link a payment method to their accounts use Square to establish an e-commerce platform between verified users. Twitter should then buy Etsy and make people's Etsy shops an extension of their Twitter accounts where other people can shop. Etsy is the perfect platform for this activity, is the right price, and a great company. They then should work on establishing Etsy user-user marketplaces similar to Facebook marketplace groups or ""buy/sell/trade"" subreddits. We need to put the cash pile to work and capitalize on e-commerce and use Squares infrastructure as a big advantage.As far as conversation and content, Twitter needs to breathe some life into the hashtag by embedding the hashtag into a tweet rather than just text that goes in the middle of a tweet. I think this would increase hashtag usage and allow Twitter to make hashtag forums in a similar way that Reddit has done with subreddits. Users should be able to follow these forums and make it a place for people to easily engage in quality conversation and information the way Reddit has done. Twitter would then consist of the Feed-Moments-Forums-Market modules where there is something for everyone, new ways to generate revenue, increased depth of conversation, and Twitter can exercise its strengths.Long term I would also love to see Twitter capitalize on its current relationship and form a partnership with the publishing industry by allowing users to pay to subscribe to specific outlets ""premium"" pages where you can view quality, 3rd party content without leaving Twitter."
Good luck to all tomorrow
"Twitter is a falling knife ... Teenagers aren't using it and neither are most adults, so where are these so called millions of people? 80% of the accounts are fake LOL if your still invested in this you have only yourself to blame."

"Ah, reminds me of CNN and Nick Sandman. How did that turn out?From Benzinga - ""Project Veritas Founder James O'Keefe Files Defamation Suit Over Twitter Ban2:00 pm ET April 20, 2021American far-right activist group Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe has slapped a defamation lawsuit against Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) in the state court in Westchester County, New York, alleging the latter of falsely implicating Keefe of operating fake accounts leading to his permanent ban, Forbes reports.Twitter’s statements on his ban were “extremely damaging to his reputation” and damaged his factfinding work, read O’Keefe’s lawsuit statements. O’Keefe alleged Twitter of subjecting him to “hatred, contempt, and ridicule.” The allegedly untrue statements “tended to diminish the esteem, respect, goodwill, or confidence,” according to Bloomberg. O’Keefe sought undetermined damages and a court injunction preventing Twitter from making false statements about him. Project Veritas has faced flak for its deceptively edited secret recordings maligning groups and companies, including Planned Parenthood, CNN, and the Washington Post. Twitter banned O’Keefe from the platform on Thursday for breaching its platform manipulation and spam policy through multiple account operations. O’Keefe had announced the defamation suit when Twitter banned him.Price action: TWTR shares traded lower by 3.12% at $65.82 on the last check Tuesday."""

Time to start a CLASS ACTION. You longs should be sueing Dorsey and Twitter. He did not show due diligence and caused you to lose money.

Ok - so anyone think this reaction is way over done and we will go back to the $40’sThumbs up - yes. Down - no. Thanks and good luck to all.
All you heathen liberals who invested your stimulus checks in this will lose that too. Time for you to finally get a job and earn an honest living for once instead of falling in your parent's footsteps.
Maybe the SEC should halt twitter for a couple of weeks to see if it is a legitimate platform.

Twitter will never be a good stocks compare to facebook.Twitter is a more bised plaltform than Facebook. india is a big market for twitter and People are moving to their own twitter like KOO app.
Going to reach $35 today
I wonder what the breakdown on that 1.9 trillion dollars between red and blue states. Most people have no clue how much that is. If you stacked 1.9 trillion one dollar bills it could go around the world approx 5 times.
"Definitely sure Twitter isn’t communist. Raul Castro, he’s a communist. $30 a month salary and no desire to improve the minimum wage? That’s communist. Let’s list other things. Unpaved streets and no infrastructure plan. Exodus immigration, net loss with more people leave than arrive. No vaccine. Corrupt police. Leaders who claim they’ll be in for life. That’s political communism. Structurally communism is pretty obvious. Classic signs:Trade wars. Which are opposite free markets. Subsidies for failed and unprofitable sectors. Handouts and welfare for most individuals rather than private sectorThe list goes on. The inability for people to discern the difference between Twitter and the government, like Utah censoring phones, is not lost. The good news is the majority can see it now that the bullhorns are silent."
Portland homicides up 2000 percent. Police are quitting because they are burned out. How is paying criminals bail working out for you. They refused help from the nationsl guard. The libs sure how to run a city.
See you soon below $20 Jack.
obama started the war on cops and pelosi started the war on the law enforcement officers who enforce the immigration laws...
Just a basement experiment that got out of hand. Now just an echo chamber for like minded socialists who have no idea that Twitter is making money off of them while giving them a platform. Classic

Expecting a trend reversal and green to close - heavy consolidation - steady 3x 4x volume past 3 days..plenty smart buys!
Twitter is a five dollar stock on a good day ....tweet that.
"It's a $40 stock, at best. Don't catch a falling knife."
Twitter everywhere. Been here for .over 3 years. Good luck to long term investors.. cheers 
"Breaking News'There's nothing about this that makes sense': Authorities grappling with the ‘why’ in South Carolina mass shooting""Clearly, the way TWTR is set up today, they will suppress the truth around this story where the gunman directed his hate toward a race and murdered so many innocent people due to racist motives. What else is there to say. It is so obvious how TWTR is suppressing truth."
"On January 15th, 2021, TWATR closed at $45.18 (double check me). Since them a WHOLE BUNCH of pump an now uncertainty into the future. Could we see the 15 Jan closing price again ... MOST DEFINITELY WE COULD!"
Still a $50 stock selling for $28+. No rational. Let’s use some of the $5 billion to buy back some stock.
Twtr is looking very good.
this is a 100% short candidate
ta side 44 next support
"Mike Flynn and Sydney Powell also banned. Gab is getting 10,000 people an hour signing up. Go to gab!"
Sad to see.
Ouch! Down again 3%. If it drops to $10 by June then I am jumping in with every penny I have.
we have lift off. block buying coming into twtr ahead of the close.
"Election audits now underway in GA, MI, WI, NH & AZ. . . Why the fight by the Dept of Justice?"
TWTR already Down 20% from high and CRASHING into earnings and theres still a gap at 61 !! IT MIGHT BE TIME TO PANIC!! It would be Down another 10% or more instantly after Miss!! Guidance can only be BAD!! So happy I SOLD!!

This was up over a dollar pre market yesterday too. It was up over a dollar this am. Please Lord keep bringing this horrible company down. Its demise will be GOOD for America. Even for the libs. They just don’t know it.
China is going to eat our lunch. Several schools in some of our large cities have less than 50 percent graduate. One school in Philadelphia a student only passed 3 classes in high school and he was in the middle of his class. There are two high schools in a large city near where I live. Each school has only 1 person proficient in math. Tell me how our country is going to compete in the world markets.
Shutting down a person's Twit account is de facto the same as defaming their character.
This isn?t the first time Elliot Investment Management has bought Twitter. Paul Singer who controls this Hedge Fund has been around distressed and bankrupt companies forever. He bought about $2 billion Twitter when nobody wanted the stock. He made a fortune on the #$%$ and fell in love with the smell.
Does the Twitter establishment have a razor wire fence around their compound yet? Grandma wants to know.
Whole market is down and this commie stock is of some $2.99 a month subscription gimmick. 
Downgrades imminent.
I had 46 twitter accounts.. 45 fake and one real.. Cancelled all of them and now I have just one on Parler..
The liberals are acting like a bunch of fools after Tim Scott's speech. They all sound like Jimmy Kimmel. Jimmy thinks he's funny but he's like a record stuck in a grove. Did anyone see a conservative tearing up Joe's speech? Yahoo will love this one and when they delete it I'll keep reposting it. I wish we could get a class action against Yahoo for being so biased and deleting what they don't like. That's why they stopped the message board.
"oh my, ACRX up 14% and climbing on Volume, ACRX new leak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FB & $TWTR good/bad/indifferent control our media"

Boom! My past posts show selling in high-$70 range after buying in low-$40 range. Swing trading is where the dollars are made.I look forward to some weird comments and at least nine thumbs down from my fluffy stalker troupe.
American communist propaganda.......
Yahoo-AOL and Twitter censor free speech......
No reason to be down 70 cents. Should be over $40+.

Twitter's debt is growing faster than its user base.
did it bounce back because of cathie wood?
Down 20.5% in a month! This will be joining MySpace and Friendster soon.

Rumor that Apple is looking to buy Twitter. Wants to expand news coverage.
"Twitter published an editorialized trending topic under its “News” section Thursday on the Arizona audit of the November election in Maricopa County, where the state Senate has ordered an independent review of the 2.1 million ballots cast. Absent from Twitter’s trending topic was any Republican defense of the audit, as the platform editorializes trends to serve as an extended arm of legacy media."

"Wonder if the UAW is just all 'a twitter' Ford will be moving the new $900,000,000 plant and associated jobs to Mexico??? Time to wake-up. The folk you mail-in voted for are robbing you of your very jobs. This is not about bashing anyone, jobs are important to America, especially Union jobs."
"Couldn't happen to an uglier fascist, censoring tool of anti-Americans."
"Let’s short this into the ground. You lived without Twitter before, you’ll be fine once it’s gone"
Sorry for all those that thought this morning was the bottom. Hold your hats :)
"I think that TWTR will face a significant change soon. Paul Singer will get approval from majority share holders to take leadeship with actions to improve TWTR market performance, which includes management change."
I like TWTR!
$100 coming
"Noto made his name because of TWTR. He takes the advenlage from TWTR's recovery for his own benefit. The direction of TWTR has been determined and the only thing left is execution. Noto's departure is no big deal for TWTR's future and he will be forgot very soon. The real game is the TWTR Q4 earning report, which should very good."
Horrible market! They just took the profit i made yesterday!
"Why do donnies dufuses keep posting about Twitter on Yahoo boards, when they aresuppose to have their own board now? Twitter must own their brainsand they pay rent to Twitter."
"African-American sportswriter Jason Whitlock tweets that a BLM co-founder is buying a $1.4 million house in a tony and white LA neighborhood. How do the Twitter brownshirts respond? Well, of course, they delete his truth-telling tweet. Twitter can't handle the truth."
"Although I don't really trust analysts, however we have to agree that their positions on certain stock will significant impact on the stock price. After TWTR's 3rd Q earning, there are at least 6 upgrades, here is one more --- ""Twitter shares climbed 4.4% to close at 25.41 on the stock market today and hit a two-year high. BTIG Research's Richard Greenfield raised his price target on Twitter on Friday to 30 from 25, saying the company was in the early stages of a multiyear turnaround.""""The end result has been not just more users of the Twitter platform, but a far more engaged user base coming back more often on a daily basis and spending significantly more time on the platform each day,"" Greenfield wrote. His report did not make reference to the Facebook news. The two forces that will driving the stock price UP are: 1) very possible outstanding 4th Q earning results, and 2) potential takeover target. Just keep in mind, because this stock was beat so bad in 2016 and the first half of 2017, only less that 50% of the funds own TWTR. It's the time for rest of fund managers to buy in, which should drive TWTR price UP significantly."
"BTW, there is no such things called conspiracy theories. They are all possibilities, could be false or could be true. When something happens, which could be anything in this universe, whose cause is apparently unknown, to investigate or analyze why did it happen investigators come up with several possibilities e.g. theories. Then they try to prove the theories to figure out the root cause. That's the process. 100 years ago Albert Einstein's created many theories that were not proven at all until now. So if you use conspiracy theory then Albert Einstein's theories were conspiracy theories for 100 years as well - right? In his theory, legendary scientist Stephen Hawking said black holes could emit radiation, it's called Hawking Radiation. Not proven, no one knows whether in future it could be proved to be true. So Hawking's theory is a conspiracy theory - right? Once again there is no such things called conspiracy theories - instead they are all possibilities, could be true could be false."
This is going to 35
Twitter is outdated!People have moved on to better things.
All this talk about boycotting Twitter. The worst offender of free speech may actually be YAHOO. Notice how the comment section was completely eliminated months before the election?
Trends point to $40/share stock July 2021.
Wow! Goldman price target $48. That is huge price target. Monday will be fun.
"Both Twitter and Square can no longer afford a part-time, cult-like ceo; especially one who tweets flippantly that he’s moving to Africa w/o any BOD and/or shareholder input. Yes Dorsey is a dynamic creative visionary but we need a SarahFriar type ceo at helm not a snowflake."
Doesn't matter where is closes today. By Friday it'll around $40.
Had twitter not been buying its own shares it would have been worse. Institutional investors will start looking a exit points now. Get out.
More Pain Coming. Chart setting up for a Flaming Red Candle on the 30

"I have been holding this stock since it dove in 2015 from about 52 to where it's now. Why I'm holding, because I see this is how the future will look like where you can have a direct communication real time. I believe this stock will out last FB. When the earning were release back in 20"

I think Twitter move to clean fake accounts is due to World Cup record number of new Twitter users world wide (more than 2 billion people follow the World Cup and Twitter is the best place for comments and highlights of the actions on each game).This is the time own Twitter folks.See ya at July 27
Maybe I will sue Dorset to recover the ads I paid before on Twatter. I couldn't not believe I gave money to this muffin liberal then he gave away 10 million dollars to the BLM.

"Seen it once, seen it 1000 times. Down 15% on heavy volume after just not quite perfect enough earnings = dead stock."
"This is the cause and effect of allowing the culture to degenerate into a ""woke"" one way street. If you tell half the nation to take a leap, what do you think is going to happen.

Twitter everywhere... go Twitter. Cheers 
I remember being interested at around $18. Bought at $30. This should be a strong stock for a few quarters. TWTR is finally clicking on all cylinders. Our little bird will soon fly with the eagles.

Wow 10 percent dropping 
It must have hurt CNN's feelings when they had to fire one of their Hitler lover reporters.
More upgrades are coming this week before earning. Analysts don’t want to be left behind. Buy buy buy.
Im putting large stake in twitter at 29.60 based on china trade wars. Great stock to be in with little to no effect on rising uncertainty with china.. Investors need to put money somewhere and less uncertainty I see with TWTR near term... Good luck all..
I think we need to investigate how many of these users are bots and sue them for fraud.

"Twitter – Trying to re-find relevance before it is too lateIt is important to note the major demographic headwinds Twitter is facing. Youth and Millennials are not flocking to Twitter (pardon for the pun) except in rare cases to view announcements from their favorite pastimes (sports, music, entertainment, finance, politics). They very much prefer Snapchat, Pinterest and Instagram (plus many one-off versions thereof). Twitter exists for them, but only in passing. They are the future of communication and social media. Jack & Company would prize this demographic if it could break into it better.To the youth of today, Twitter (which has been around FOREVER in their minds) is the Yahoo! of yesteryear. I know of what I speak, my millennial son (& daughter) refuse to check Twitter even for information about his own college sports team (he is on)! They are addicted to the other venues; he and my daughter have no interest in what Lady Gaga had for lunch or how good or bad whatever administration in office is.On the opposite end of the spectrum are the Boomers who comprise ~30% of the US population. They live, breath and die Facebook (connect to family, friends). Remember the commercial where the lady used Post-it notes for her posts on the dry erase board? That captured many a boomer’s attention. Within the past year some created secondary ‘social media’ Twitter accounts to discuss politics. As-of late, few have stayed, but many have fled back to the friendly confines of Facebook.In the middle is where Jack & Co. exist, the Gen-X, Gen-Z and other folk between 32 and 55. They want to know stuff and they want to know now. They do have very solid buying power and are attractive to advertisers. With the new business model they are working on, he and the executive team are trying to upsell this demographic the best they can. Announcing paid content, paid accounts to follow, and anything that could generate revenue off the main focus group.It is unfortunate, and not likely, the other ends of the social media demographic pie will ever migrate; Twitter management knows this only too well. As the millennials age, they will take up more and more room on the social media spectrum and unfortunately, Yahoo! (sorry, I meant Twitter) is not going to be in their wheelhouse.Many of that middle group are now exiting for different discussion venues, and that is important loss Jack & Co. have to overcome. Twitter is a STATUS application. In the ‘biz’ we call it ‘push communications’. You can ‘push’ out content and status, but as for the true ‘social’ backbone, it is very narrow; Twitter was never engineered to be a BLOG. Remember, they even reported user interactions down in Q4 and we have yet to even see a taste of Q1.Telegram is a MAJOR apple cart disrupter for Twitter. They are engineered to be a major ‘push’ engine. Channels are subscribed to and push information to users. There are discussions in Chat Channels, but nothing compared to the subscribed channels with folk waiting for information.Why do I bring up Telegram? In a short amount of time they have almost doubled the number of users Twitter has. They are growing quickly. There is ALWAYS a new kid on the block trying to win the social media beat down game.Parler you say? Niche only. Folk disgruntled ONLY about a political outcome seem to be over there. Between it and GAB and CloutHub, they may have drained off 10% of the Twitter user attention.So where does this leave Jack & Co. They are completely redoing their business model to capture the ‘middle dollars’. Boomers, Millennials and youth won’t pay for them. Advertisements are nice but non-middle demographic folk already have one-click Amazon prime accounts and know what they want. They are getting harder and harder to influence.So where does that leave Twitter compared to the big dog, Facebook?Facebook earns $10.09 per share. It has a P/E of 25.98 given a price of $262. Facebook market cap is 745.83B. Financially speaking, they are under valued for a social media platform.Twitter earns -$1.44 per share and has no P/E. Twitter market cap is 61.91B. Twitter with a current price of $77 would have to earn $4 per share to support the same P/E (check my math). Yes, they just earned 39 cents in Q4 and projecting a loss Q1 of 2021. The hill is super steep.Maybe Jack & Co. can get to $4 share in EPS, maybe not. He has to put all the boots on the ground or Twitter really has no bright future given their narrow demographic constraints and social media ‘push’ platform.Be careful out there chasing stocks or cars!"
You think this is bad? Wait until earnings.
Have some patience it's not going to go up 50% overnight. This is what the blue bird does. Climbs 3-4% days and then builds some momentum and boom we're back to 40s. U want all or nothing instantly play the tables
Deleted Twitter Account this morning. Felt really good doing it. Wish i could do it 1000 x.
Love seeing the days highs hit in AM so even lib day traders burn 
JP Morgan says this is easily a $50 stock. The World Cup will boost revenue and their push into video will accelerate revenue growth.
Loving and caring advice: Sell Twitter ahead of major institutional liquidations like Vanguard. They are definitely done with Twitter.
CHINA CAUSED THE VIRUS AND NEEDS to be punished severely.
How does this stock not hit $40 in the near term?
"Brutal facts,are still the same- buyout possible- growing revenue - growing business - chart building up....more to add...."
The best is when it sinks intraday so even lib day traders get burned. I can watch this all day.
Um did anyone see Josh on CNBC pushing sell twitter at $32 ??
If it is down on Monday then the share holders law suits will start. This could get ugly!
Don't be a Jack DENIERReminder from the $TWATR itself from the Q4 earnings release concerning 29 Apr Q1:= Revenue to be between $940 million and $1.04 billion (Q4 was $1.29 billion!)= Income to be between a loss of $50 million and break even (Q4 was 222 million!)
TWTR: finally a garbage stock. tiktok type will be the trend this traditional conversation platform anyway..
"WARSAW, POLAND Jan 15 (Reuters) - Social media companies that remove posts they deem offensive could face fines, Poland's justice minister said on Friday. We need to do the same here!"
"If Fb can recover the loss, TWTR will follows. It is happening now."
"A lot of short-sighted people on here, imo. What I think many are forgetting is that Twitter and Square are both ran by JD which suggest that the fintech initiatives being developed at Square may be applied to the Twitter platform at some point. If that happens, it could be a huge game changer, so before you start looking down on the stock, try to look into the future and brainstorm what integrations may be possible due to Twitter's connection to Square via JD."
Looks like Twitter slowly moving to the $40
Unfortunately I see a future where liberals only shop at businesses that support their views. The liberal economy will be in ruins as conservatives continue to pay for their welfare checks.
Good buy price this am.
"55 was a barrier we all knew that, will continue up all day. Might break this week/ next for $60"
Red = buy. Will end easily in the green.
My portfolio is doing just fine with 46 in office. Thank goodness 45 is long gone after losing in the most secure election ever. And look at the mess Kushner left for 46. I though President Kushner achieved peace in the Middle East. So strange.

"Very nice move today, $30.00 is closer and closer!"
"“Monetizable” users are clearly not being monetized. Twitter so clearly is a forum for more controversial discussion relative to other social media. People are not using real names - except for celebrities, politicians, and media types. People are more difficult to track and send ads to. I use Twitter. I do not use a real name to comment on controversial topics, as I fear professional repercussions (I am not in politics or media). The targeted ads I get are cheap clickbait with photos of seemingly half naked people or medical photos that look pornographic at first glance. Twitter is failing to target ads appropriately. And, the forum is encouraging anonymity as it allows for more toxic commentary than non-anonymous Facebook. I am feeling negative right now; I think the stock price reflects recent changes and the inability to monetize “monetizable” users like myself who browse daily but don’t follow too many people and have no followers as I remain anonymous."
Tlaib said we should dismantle the police. Yeah that's really going to help.
Surprised pro 45'ers aren't buying bamboo stocks.
Wow this is BAD!! 15% CRASH on Friday and DOWN MORE today!! I hope it doesnt open under $50 tomorrow!!

Twitter lost 3 billion yesterday. Keep it coming!
big miss fak， im broke
Heard on CNBC bears are turning bullish Bullish are turning more bullish
It appears the reason for the move in TWTR today is positive word from Cleveland Research about Twitter ad trends
"When you have a platform that kicks off the conservative voices of your choice, how is this going to help stockholders and is Jack Dorsey simply ignoring the 2nd amendment? The answer is 100% yes and why I am shorting Twitter. If you are in this stock, Monday is not going to be fun!"

But no worries...there will be no doubt more $$$ for more pronoun police, neighborhood minders booze and drugs for the tent dwellers...tee hee....."
Ouch! Down again and heading towards $50.

There will be a rise of a conservative social media. And it won't be Jack at the top.
"$SNAP down almost 10%. We need to do better here folks, we can't let them win the race to the bottom of the social media junkyard!"
Wow TWTR CRASHED thru $50 now!! COLLAPSING!!
"Worth a stab down here. Social media stocks are wild swingers, but at the end of the day, they usually prevail stronger than ever"
How is my $40 buy not filled?!
"75 million people , plus people around the world hate twitter and commi dorsey , going to 15$?"
social media is a bubble driven by artificial bots. they fake their financials too
"So heavily shorted, great setup for HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE!!"
Twitter will recover ...What goes down goes up...I bought it at 45 2000 can’t sell will hold for long term...
....because everyone wants to pay a fee to hear what bitter SJW Kool-Aid haired zoomers have to say.
awe....hate this so much.....
I sold all mine at twitter and close my account with twitter and I am asking all to do the same. This is for Our freedom and constitution.
"Small caps and the Russell down 2.59%. That’s a drubbing. Small caps have been propping the market for 3 months. Tax selling is rough, but not an indicator of fundamentals"
TWTR has lot of potential could be a take over target...time will tell
what do you expect from Twitter tomorrow. up or down?
"The increase in DAU's is a beacon of hope here, also that this is a positive free cash flow company ( unlike snap ).. Looking at the charts of the past 2 15% drops on 27th july 2018 & 7 feb 2019 twtr bounced back 5% within 3 weeks. Will wait thi sout hoping that trend continues."
"TWTR has not suppressed new voter rules and that is a good thing. From what i am reading in those states website there is nothing racist about the laws they are proposing to change. THe ones complaining may be the bigger problem. No one inspected the many food trucks that rolled into the polling centers. in fact, there is no formal inspections of any kind and workers and supervisors allow people to come and go as they please. it seems like it is run like a high school prom election. Out election process has all of the looks like a union based process where there is no checks and controls. It is apalling our country has not taken its election process serious and secures the process to the same level we do to protect financial assets. Where is TWTR on this one?"
Good morning you commie heathens....figured I'd stop in quick to say I hope you lose every dime invested in this garbage company....HAVE A GREAT DAY!
"Political bent: What if, just what if, the 'grand bargain and action plan' formulated by the traditional DNC and progressives was exposed to eyes at the beginning of last summer after ALL other DNC candidates 'gracefully' bowed-out of the race in favor of 'The Big Guy'. What if they were given enough rope to execute on the action plan knowing it was a matter of time before the walls caved in?Just a total hypothetical."
"I'm still long in this stock. Legalized sport gambling, the Olympics and the next Presidential election will bring a record number of users and advertising dollars to Twitter. Don't let this short attack be the reason to sell your shares at a discount. This bird is built for the long haul."
we going to the moon and we know it
Ok guys it’s time for $35
all you amateurs on here saying this stock will go to 20$ convinces me otherwise.....Jack Dorsey runs Square...I think he knows what he's doing...
So glad i bought 12000 shares under $15..this is going to be trading in 50s soon.
Joe Dementia is a moron and you sheep are just as stupid Follow Jack Meoff. To zero
Another example of how Twitter is a joke for all social media. For years they allow Mr Baffert to hold a TWTR account. From what we know todaym he may have rigged derby outcomes for over three decades through dopping horses with undetectable drugs. TWTR allows him to continue tweeting and yet censros others for less criminal activities. TWTR is a mockery and refelcts where millenials are today.
"Oh I love it so much, tear down this stock and the entire market! Waste this enemy company into BK along with all it's worthless enemy employees, and clip this overbought market good too. Yes! I want to see tears of regret everywhere with democrat voting millennials wiped out."
"""Twitter's number of monetizable daily active users jumped 20% year over year to 199 million. Its revenue, in turn, rose 28% to $1.04 billion, fueled by a 32% increase in ad sales to $899 million. Growth was particularly strong in international markets, where Twitter's revenue surged 41%, to $480 million.""Advertisers continue to benefit from updated ad formats, improved measurement, and new brand safety controls,"" Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said in a press release.""Stay focused on the long term prize!Bullish / Strong Buy!"
If a Market Correction hits....
After hours estimates it will decline by at least 12% on Friday. Could it hit $50/share by June?
" The Bottom LineTwitter stock had ramped a lot into the quarter. It sold off when the firm reported solid, but not blowout numbers. Don’t be tricked into believing the company can’t deliver just because the stock sold off sharply in one day. Not much has changed. The company is still executing on its strong roadmap.The firm only bought Revue in Q1. Give it a few quarters to gain enough features and get rid of all the bugs for it to properly compete with Substack. Once Revue is improved, Twitter will push it harder which will help it gain market share in the fast-growing newsletter business."
"I'm glad TWITLER is gone, Now the country can return to decency and sanity."
"Ouch! Dow is up but Twittylee is down AGAIN! Did someone say ""Parler""?"
"Dont worry it can only go ""ZERO"""
"Good riddance TWTR. You got woke, glad you're going broke. I cancelled my own account with you and love to see your sudden new success. You deserve all of it. Self-made if there ever were such."
"Twitter data licensing business helps capture the amazing uses of Twitter by builiding on that public data. By nature, Twitter is public. Twitter doesn't sell user info."
Horrific guidance revision. $40 stock at best.
This company decided to define the word hate and censor those it disagrees with. Now it is time to pay the price. Going forward will only be worse.
Let's test free speech again. Joe...Donald came up with operation warp speed. Don't try to take credit. Second time posting.
twitter to hit $45 next few days!! sell
"Silver Lake's conversion price is $41.50, according to documents filed with the SEC, suggesting that Silver Lake is bullish that the stock can climb that high through a combination of accretive buybacks and improved operational performance."
anyone shorting the stock ?
this shady company is going to $10. NO PROFIT!
Something BAD is Coming!!
"Love to see investors make money, just not on this company. Twitter has a political agenda and for that reason I hope they fail.￼"
Probably a wise decision to ban all political Ads. Thinking about all those foreign countries try to have a voice in our election snd Twitter have to deploy many employees to detect and verify the Ads might cost Twitter a lot of money and flashbacks if thing go wrong. Keep Twitter clean.
Twitter suspended a Spanish politician’s account last week after he tweeted “a man cannot get pregnant” because “they have no uterus or eggs”.
"I put an order 1,000 shares of twtr at .99cents"
Dorsey is a socialist dwarf. It shows in the stagnant price of the stock over the years and his inability to be a good manager. Laughable.
"The whites keep lying about Breona, but the truth seeps out anyway. 32 shots fired into the home and not one of them should have been. That’s how a wrongful death occurs. That’s why no knocks are gone in turtle mitchs state. That’s why there was a 20 million cash payout. That’s why those 3 officers stand trial. That’s why we continue to look at ways to drain the white contamination from these departments. We take away their money and their toys and make them police. They hate that."
"A new demdonkey dog whistle was unveiled by 158 year old Sleepy Joe at yesterday's depressed conference. ""Jim Eagle"". Sorry guys. I guess Portland burns again this weekend."
"5 Million Shares -After hours trading.Are these the Dark pools they talk about. They buy them cheap, but transactions are not recorded when they are actually executed. I don't want to predict anything but I feel tomorrow shares will go UP"
How long will it be til' yahoo starts banning finance conversations?
Happy New Year to all you Twitter followers. Let’s hope 2019 is the year for a cool  & significant break out to the upside!!
we don't have to go to the Capital building to let everyone know how we feel about what's going on we can handle it here
15% haircut for bagholders. Ouch.
If your business burns down send the bill to Maxine Waters
The smart ones have sold already. The real decline will occur once TWTR is forced to publish the reduced subscribership statistics. That will be a beautiful event.
Jack Dorsey tweeted of selling 2.5 million shares
how is twitter stock going up? by the end of 2021 there will by like 30 accounts left cuz everyone else will have been banned.
Election is over & best customer TWTR ever had is deleted--KMA.
If $twtr closes near high of day and share trade sideways or up in after hours trading we will repeat today’s action again tomorrow.
All that BBBBSSSSS a month ago about huge upbeat forecast guide that sent this to $80. And now right back down to reality. What a crock.
Trump is going to destroy this company. He breathe life into this garbage in 2016 and now he will pull the plug on it. this company will lose half it's user when the Trump social media platform is up and running. I will be looking to short this and I have a hunch that there will be many more traders thinking the same.
I predict $60.94-$62.00
I have opened a Parler account. The censorship is out of control and is politically motivated. Censorship is bad regardless of politics.They are the CCP of the internet.
WOW TWTR is COLLAPSING!!
Valuation is ridiculously high.No earnings in sight.
Dorsey controlling speech will soon be over
Anyone here investment followers of Mr. Elliott or Ms. Wood?
The most anti American company on the planet. Twitter. Pro China.
"I don’t understand in the modern age, why the police chase cars and conduct traffic stops for minor violations. In a Free State, the notion we are constantly monitored in our daily tasks by the police, and then stopped with weapons drawn, and asked for papers, certifications, and then entrapped with dogs trained to signal when their handler taps their foot, and not allowed to question that evidence... No, I think it would suffice that unless a vehicle has been identified in a crime, or its owner has a warrant, there are NO traffic stops for minor infractions. A ticket can be mailed to the perpetrators address, and video and analytic evidence, speedometers, and similar will be used to adjudicate. Patrol officers wouldn’t even carry weapons. Why would they? A radical de-escalation needs to happen. Defunding is the wrong approach. Rethinking why we have armed conflicts between motorists going about their drives and police is easy when you realize these escalate the moment the police intervene in MINOR stops. Guns come out and innocents, officers, and perps get shot."
TWTR IS ..........TOTINGA LOT OFTIMMMMMMMMMMMMMBERRRRRRRRR
sell sell sell
Looking forward to seeing TWTR trading in the low twenties and eventually to zero. Communist companies don't deserve to be publicly traded.
"Let's ban honest discourse about voting, diseases, and treatments...but allow radical, violent criminals to organize their assaults on America...what could go wrong?"
Upgrade and it rockets ️this was the short firms true intentions. Downgrade it and then buy back to profit 15-20% free upside. Congrats to all who got on the boat.
Sam Spade just fell on his own sword.
"Smash this enemy commie arrogant company along with EVERYONE who works for them, they are all enemies now, that was their choice too, over and over and over again. Treat them as enemies now, make them feel every morsel of it!"
Recovery
Gimme ur shares and your shares and tours too
99.7% of Twitter employees are LIBERAL.ENOUGH SAID
"Cathie Girlfriend! I've Been Following This Blue Bird For Over 4 Years! And I Have Lost All Confidence In Her! They Talk The Talk! But Do Not Walk The Walk! Maybe You Can Whip Them Into Shape! But, I'm Not Holding My Breathe! They Have No Follow Through! Where Are The Paid Subscriptions And The Pay Using Your TWTR Account!?!? They Have Been Talking About These For A Year Now! And Still Nothing! I Sure Hope You Did Your Home Work On This One!"
"FB, MSFT, DIS, has to buy TWTR now that FB will be removed from all media outlets ... TWTR will absorb all the lost FB ad revenue from media companies.. It’s only a matter of time.. No one can compete with TWTR..!"
LMAO. I was spot on. Said last week that it's below $70 then below $60 at the end of this week. Low today was $59. LMAO to the bank.
"Sick of getting trapped in this. It's happened so many times, and have to wait it out................again. I will not take a loss on this thing."
"Over 10,000 of my followers on Twitter disappeared since last weekend. Their accounts are completely gone, if you click through to them. I will ALSO be deleting my account end of the week, just keeping it open for now to monitor the drift of people OFF THE PLATFORM. Not posting any tweets now. BOTTOM LINE IS THEY'VE GONE, and most of them were not political people."
snap and pins went up 30% after earnings. Hopefully twtr will have the same gain. Good luck to all tomorrow.Long since January 2016.
We need to be able to check whether the person we’re dating has AIDS or herpes—perhaps we can incorporate that into the Vaccine passport.
"Sold my shares, don't want to be part of a company that allows Iran and China free reign to speak but censors the US President."
Twitter is here to stay their will be a day when people won’t believe it was under 100 bucks .
What we are witnessing is a conservative hit on Twitters stock price ! Most conservatives are business owners and have money !Hold the short position and if you own a business clean house
Fact Check:: Will TWTR ever stop Losing $Billions?? Of course its Doomed to Failure and will be $0 per share one day.
100 plus coming
Interesting to see what happens today as the markets recover from last week.
big tech making a dump. down down goes oppressors
I'm selling my 1000 shares on Monday morning. TWTR crossed the line and attacked our constitutional rights yesterday. Peace out.
Everyone that was going to sell has sold time to move this back to the 40's
$100 after earnings and a dividend plan. We must moon this!
Time to buy
16 cent? Is that the best you got? Lol! This stock is garbage. It will never recover for a plethora of reasons. The biggest one is real Americans would wipe their behind with a social media platform that panders to leftist communists like Hollywood and the Democrat party. This should be shorted with every spare dollar you have.
Why isn't this at $27 yet? Stop putting off the inevitable.
"TWTR's own crytpo currency is coming it can swap seamlessly between SQ and twtr, twtr currency will be able to pay/manage/sponsor/advertise/monitor and program your page. most people who use twtr will back this currency as it will be more stable than the dollar and will realize for sub 5 cents. Jack is smart dont under estimate this man, hes waiting patiently for the world to grow and mass adoption of twtr before he ignites the REAL engine"
40's very soon.
TWTR looks to hold above 31.00. at the close
selling at open bell...
"So Fb caves to govt. censorship to freedom of speech and Twitter does not. So now the CEO is under constant media attack for standing up to govt. scrutiny for upholding the 1st amendment. Look at Fb shares to Twitter, 1 is going up 4 obeying and the other is not. The world we live in."
ahhh the value of socialism
I love it.
$50-$44 next week
WAIT TILL IT SETTLES THEN BUY AGAIN....EARNINGS IN APRIL .....
"This stock is dog water, 0 pr, no earnings, freer than a sample at costco."
"Warning label: After the shock before market sell-off (inflation and Citi advertiser related), be very wary of the dreaded DCB. This is a classic pattern before a really big fall."
"Noto already talking up SoFi on TWTR, it's a given that SoFi will be a large advertiser on TWTR, glass half full:)"
Want to thank one by one all the shorts out there... Thank you
"COVID-19 fatalities since 20 Jan 2021 = 144,840"
Will be 122 in 1-3 years
"Pressers, investor day, then convertible bond/common shareholder dilution day. Not a good look. Gap fill down coming to a theatre near you soon ..."
Down baby down! I love it 
"Noticing a trend how Twitter seems to support the movement of illegal immigrants to the point where children are separated from their families, illegal entry is supported through the use of Twitter to relay messages to others who are seeking illegal entry. TWTR is an uncontrolled company that use used by nefariousness people to engage in their scheming activities."
What about the active users though?I’m long on Twitter...been waiting for the market to come around here.
TWTR Crashing since the close on April 23!! At January levels now!! This is SO BAD!!
Hey guys. I'm 20 and want to invest part of my savings and buy 35 shares now. Is it worth it?
Systemic short holders call me a racist I’m short Twtr long XOP
"How could a company which was declaring a loss of over $7 Billion back in March, just hand $10 Billion of shareholders money to BLM? Hello SEC? Can you look into this..."
"lol sorry china, only twitter is allowed to to have fake propaganda bots xD"
$50-$45 Monday
This need some analysts to raise target price to 45+++Then we fly 50+++++++
"Yes, I'm not a fan of Jack and his business model at all. Putting all that aside for a moment, and from a traders view, does anyone here think the stock will drop below $49 soon?"
TWTR will be $45 on Friday.
Is there any conversation about TWTR stock here?? See lots of post and nothing to do with the stock?
Has anyone heard from Paul Cho ?
Hypothesis: Elliott and Wood on big spaced buys. Watch what the day brings. Inflation can not be ignored anymore. The WH and MSM have been covering it up poorly. The covers are now off.
Buying puts already making me money for July . 50 percent going down
"I just went to GAB, like 20,000 new users an hour, the site just went down under mainteance.wow"
Love watching this communist company die!
"I bought 8346 shares at $ 37.00 +/- back in 2015, and held this long. Can't believe I am finally making money!"
Up 45 cents today with market down over 300 points. Wonder how much we would be up in a positive market. Believe we will get to $50 over next few months.
If you didn't get in yesterday or want to add to your shares. This is looking like a Great Entry Point! Tweet Tweet:)
said it a month ago... get rid of this stock. Jack Dorsey screwed you for his political ideology and created a dichotomy where half the population doesnt support social media... and sees these clowns as dividing the country. I'm back in at $30/share.
Who is ready for a nice close in 40s tomorrow?!?!? What a way to end the week. Feels like the Fourth of July 
I wonder if my $20 order will get filled today?
liberal trash company.
This is karma for kicking off our president. Get ready to bleed for weeks.
Twitter: Over promise and fail to deliver much of anything. Read the Motely Fool write-up. Puffery and fluffery. Will 'this time' me different? 15 year-old company ...
Fly birdie fly! Denouncing hatred is a winning formula.
Continue to short this stock close all long positions.
Now that is one BigA DCB (Dead Cat Bounce)? for NAS and $TWTR!!! We will see what comes ahead ...
"Twitter is an incredible platform, there is also a possibility of takeover from Disney, Microsoft, Google, Apple to buy out this company!"
Penn State faculty and Twitter think the same. Now making up new words to replace words that hurt their feelings..... poor babies.
"Apparently Pothead buckled and unlocked NYpost's account. Too little too late. In fact, this might backfire and alienate the other 50% of the active user base."
FIFTY THREE FIFTY!!This bird is being grounded even faster than I thought!!!
Twitter is showing huge growth and more growth potential. This will easily double.
Wow Lowest Close of TWATR Crash!! DISASTER!!
Snagged a few shares. I'm in
Remember all those bogus losing lawsuits challenging the results of the election? Amazing track record of failure after the Big Failure of 11/3/20.
TWITTER = 330 million users. Subtract the 75 million that will leave....thats a 20% drop in users.
Descent engaged Captain.
"we wouldn't take twitter stock if it was given to us for nothing. We are watching it fall., It may well go bankrupt, what does it own of value?? censorship is costing this stock to fall, Americans have had it."
Did Cathy Wood Sell yet??
It takes a lot courage to hold TWTR thru the weekend.Best to get out before the closing bell.
"Anyone still using TWTR? As Capt. Kirk would say, if you’re still using TWTR, get a life people!"
FakePrez has DESTROYED EVERYTHING with the help of TWATR!!
$80 to $55Yikes
This is worse than the fall of the Soviet Union for TWATR Demcoms
Is this $40 yet?
THE FADE IS BEAUTIFUL. Fifty THREEEEES. THIS IS FOR AMERICA.
Hit 50 today it’s coming ! Tick tock
I am proud of my culture and proud to be unique in this world proud and unapologetic for being born the way I was.

twitter followers after its dismantled
Cathy Pump and Dump might Dump it all at once any minute now
3 times the trading column and its only mid day
how those twitter numbers going?
Shorts and people closing their accounts took control of Twitter's price.
"Failure to understand ‘Sell in May and go away’ will be costly. Old adages, good advice especially for summer when social media usage declines sharply."
"Mulish and resentful MAGA loons have no idea how fine a place twitter is without a POTUS repetitively tweeting about how he ""won by a lot""."
"In 2024, Twtr will be $202.40"
I’m confident we’ll close above $30 today. The consolidation around this price tells me this is strong support.
this is the only stock that deserves to go down
"If we see 3 times earnings beat as a poster posted, be a huge jump in stock price."
"No one reads your diatribes, DEC. Stock up on tissues for 2024."
"The global advertising business will continue its shift online in 2020, and Bank of America named Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) as the two best stock plays in digital media."
Users are hemorrhaging. I have 2 locked accounts that prevent me from accessing 'settings' to deactivate them. This artificially inflates the number of actual active users.
"Mommy Cathi Woods, cannot Pump and DumpTWTR, any more."
cathie pedowood cant save this already exposed company.
The stock had been manipulated for political purposes ... how in the earth this was $80 ? I believe Soros / Bloomberg and the gang decided to take a break and let this stock go where it belongs ....
"I say, release the kraken. Oh my tweets, how are the “recently served” doing? Are they still running from the process servers, like hood Americans do? How are Powell, wood, Giuliani, lindell, Dobbs, pirot, and the rest of the sued, feeling? Maybe they could all get vocl about it? What’s that? Oh no! That’s already shut down for legal cease and desist purposes because “don’t care mike” doesn’t look before he leaps off cliffs."
"Many young people who began investing in 2009 have only seen market gains (except for a few tremors) over the last 12 years. What stomach will they have when we have a 2000 or 2008 again? Lies of 'no inflation' and 'free money' (thru almost zero interest rate from the Fed to banks) and 'no substantial new taxes' will open many an eye and possibly foster the next market recession.Will never happen? If we keep printing money we don't have and our currency is devalued, look at the PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain), Venezuala, etc.. Be careful out there."
No reason for Twitter not to head to $25/sh...BIG SELL
Get out before the next earnings. This is going to tank.
"I added more at $44 today. This reminds me of the same kind of bs that FB deals with and look at FB today, all time high. TWTR is a keeper, granted I don’t tweet on a regular basis, but I also haven’t posted on FB for months even though I have over 500 friends. Today’s selloff in TWTR was a great buying opportunity, imo."
"Such a glorious day once again to see this piece of useless garbage red once again. Your homeless looking pedo CEO Jack decides to delete one of his largest users and this doing so loses have his customers. Great business model and yes, great quarter Jack. Enjoy the financial pain pin head scufty looking sea men swallower."
"Hey @lito This you right? Good call, it was $30+/- when you ""advised"" everyone about TWTR ..... Now $70+/-lito10 months ago$TWTR conversationDon't wait for the Executive Order..... This is not gonna go anywhere...but down."
FB Rev for Americas is accelerating but mau still the same at 242. That bodes well for TWTR earnings on feb 7.
Sell it now
"Dr shiva will take down twitter all on his own. Lawsuit is all but victorious already. Discovery in its way. Twitter put options getting very expensive ! You made money on way up, if your smart and not emotional, you will make in way down! Tick tock."
- 15% monday
"Twitter went woke so they are now going broke, just like nba, nfl and corporations that all of sudden their CEOs stepped down all at once LOL. Look it up! Most stepped down to keep their arrest out of the news. Mr Dorsey is gone for ever in my opinion . 30-60 days twitter is down more than 60 percent"
They had some interesting insights about TWTR on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"HOW MANY TIMES DO WE SEE THIS MESSAGE?Our goal is to create a safe and engaging place for users to connect over interests and passions. In order to improve our community experience, we are temporarily suspending article commenting.Media spoon feeds us their view 24/7, but we can't express our views. No different that social media censoring anything they don't agree with. Anti-American. Dictatorship. We need to get rid of these types of media."
not sure why ppl pay that much for a company that is barely growing
What has become of Twatter? Is it anything more than a leftist echo chamber for Twatteratti?
Analysts (?!) are taking turns in trying hard to keep the stock from falling. No substance.
"Good Eye Roaster. The short term (2 weeks out) Sept.13th calls at the $45 strike price started the day with only 260 open interest.The volume on the day was 13,724... That's what you would call unusual activity and can indicate someone knows something is going to happen big time in the next two weeks"
"My son and his friends laughed at me when I asked if they had a twitter account.. ""That's for old people and liberal malcontents"" His exact words lol ... get woke go broke"
"Y'all check on DJT's new communications platform? Now that he's a private citizen, he doesn't need to pretend to be a booster of anything. So all he does is insult people."
Remember to cover your shorts let the price go up and let the retail investor pay more for this hot mess!
Does anyone have an idea of the earnings report?
Wow look at that chart.It has $25 written all over it.
SELL this piece or you will go BROKE
"Proof that Big Tech is not reporting the news they should be for all Americans.THE KRAKEN: Retired General Says US Military Intel Group, Nicknamed ‘Kraken’, Seized Dominion Servers in Germany""They are guilty of treason,” said Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerneyes. Millenials seem to be duped or gullible. No matter how big they lie they seem to accept not having the truth. This will come back to haunt them in their later years."
"Imagine being Babbitt’s mother or husband. To hear Carlson on TV last night describe the ignomius death of your bride or child as “old people milling about the Capitol with extreme ideas.” To bear him describe the thunderclap feeling of a billet entering your neck and taking your last beleaguered breathers in a neck beard’s lap surrounded by selfie cams, not worried about themselves but your dying winking moment as a selfie. And Carlson describes your life’s beliefs as being from unfashionable zip codes. As the flesh sears and separates around the projectile entering your caratoid and vision fades and sounds good dull and you bleed out. That’s what Carlson says of Babbitt. That’s what he thinks of the little game played at the Capitol on Jan 6 Traitor Day. And whether you believe she died rightly or wrongly, doesn’t matter. To be fodder for Salty Swanson turkey gravy boy is a bitter pill. I’d say the mom and husband of Babbitt should sue, if they ever get back from Cabo"
I sold my 300 shares at 28.30 as I had an anxiety attack no Xanax left and now it's back up !
"This stock market is toast, it's going to be a long 4 years, jeez."
Growth is finished. User base is maxxed out and conservatives are leaving in droves.
Twitter is falling like a Dotcom Bubble stock in 2000
"Sleepy Joe said Tara Reade was lying. He couldn’t remember her, but knew she was lying. He said the would never say “C’mon Man” to a broad."
If NASD closes up less than $100 this will finish under $50 
Target $60 in 6 months or sooner!
How are Hitlers Shareholders doing today?
"most likely we see more invented news to cover for the revenue / profit miss on 4/29, may drive things up for a little while"
"Down nearly twenty percent since the censorship of a sitting President and an attempt to alienate half of America's population, wonder why? I thought liberals were responsible for all of the social media and on-line spending or at least that is what they claimed."
When do the TWTR layoffs start??
Just bought more at an incredible price. Thank you to those selling into the fear.
Cover now or cover much higher shorts!
"PPS performance under Part Time CEO Dorsey's last 4+ years = DOWN. Barely above IPO price of $26 in 2013, down 33% from the first day close of $44.95. Down 17% since $36.22 when Dorsey took over the second time 7/15. All time high $73.31, 12/13. Markets = ALL TIME HIGHS. Now moving to Africa...past time for him to permanently move on. Last Qtr's debacle is ALL lack of execution. ALL on the CEO's lack of engagement and leadership. TWTR should be $75+. TWTR's popularity as a news/communication platform has no equal...they are not monetizing it! Shareholders need to hold the BOD accountable. Need an activist to step in big time! Hopefully Scott's letter will start some movement!"
"Note to TWATR - Losing Billions of Dollars and then by charging people to make or undo comments in an attempt to make a real profit, is not a good business plan."

"The Turnip (aka The Mango Mussolini) has issued an edict to his followers, boycott Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ViacomCBS, Citigroup, Cisco, UPS, and Merck.It is unclear at this point whether Nike, Harley Davidson, Ford, Yeti, Taylor Swift and the NFL have been removed from the Boycott List but the Turnip has urged all to send their generous donation checks to Big-o-Lardo to aid in the support of these worthy endeavors and to curtail the high upkeep cost."

The hearings are for public consumption - it is impossible to pass legislation that could in any way impose sensible regulations to regulate news. The most that could happen concerns privacy - and there is only so much that can be done. Nonsense .
"I turned on the boob-tube. What was I thinking??? EVERYTHING is about RACE! Systemic Racism, reparations, hate against Asians, 'white' men killing 10 in a CO grocery store (ooops, we meant their skin was white but background not Anglo Saxon). AND every commercial ... I did not know every single marriage in the USA is now inter-racial!!???. Absolutely no problem with that, I was just uninformed in my community until the TV told me so.America is the most heterogenous conglomeration of folk on the planet. We are by far the best, most inclusive country who values character over color. I will admit in the COMPUTER INDUSTRY it is fairly homogenous between Anglo Saxon and Indians. HOWEVER, it is NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING to get EVERYONE interested. Most aren't, with a want to be soft liberal arts majors ... and then we get into the student loan thing, uggghhhh!"

The best short set up in the entire market ..
"By tomorrow the algo selling should settle down but now after seeing SNAPs results which they beat on all metrics, revenues & earnings they r still down so dosent matter what twtr reports looks like the trend is heading down.."
And to think this hit $45 after last ER and sits at $38 today. Don't forget that Twitter is considered a long term growth stock.
Really want to buy under 50
"The 30 year T bill should have a 3.5% Coupon.JPM, C, Bac, would all benefit.Why would anyone want to buy a second tier social mediacompany, that cannot earn a profit? TWTR afraid paidsubscription model, would confirm lack of demandfor their site."
Would totally invest if they didn't constantly violate peoples' freedom of speech.
Was itching to sell a couple puts all weekend in this one.
"Please dont throw your money buying at this point.wait for a reversal to jumo in..I was extremely positive on this stock but now the hard truth has to be faced. The TWTR model is good & works great for the few promoters who need to broadcast their message on social media, however it is not monetizing & growing to the forward PE & doubtful now if it will in the next 2 qtrs. In fact thats what Segal said on the conf call, So even the one positive news of increased MDAU's is suspect now in terms of monetization.This stock is owned by big institution ( banks like MS, JPM, BOA * ETFs etc ) , they have lowered the price target to a consensus of 34. Now not only do they own twtr, they also determine its price so how in the world do u expect this to get to even 32+ unless they revise their price points..??"
"Now Youtube bans Steve Bannon Podcast one of the top in the country. Problem is TWTR, GOOG, FB can not ban the platforms who practice freedom of speech. There will be a Nasdaq disaster on Monday."
"Is being called a communist, or labeled one unfactually somewhere, an existential or real threat? Freedom of speech is not a defense for libel or slander. Anti-SLAPP laws are not a defense for intentful, aimed attacks to denigrate a reputation or remove business or social opportunities. Twitter and other social platforms currently have no meat in the game if one member calls another member a communist. Today. But a repeal of Section 230 suddenly makes any social platform complicit. Under this setup, any and every platform will willingly divulge the necessary j formation to reveal the perpetrators to avoid litigation. And, they will stop, freeze, and store the information for the courts, not simply visually remove it."
New target 12.00 for being involved with anti American extreme censorship.
Oversold
"It seems that TWTR is ready for a false down break-through succeeded by a gap filling at $60+. Will it go to $70+ after that, or drop to $45, that is a question."

"Say what you will, the Floyd case was originally documented as Medical Incident During Police Interaction. That’s how it was tweeted, sent to the AP, and reported by the bigs.

What is everyone thinking about the upcoming earnings?
Hello 20 bucks￼
UBS raised price target to $25 from $21 per share.
"Andrew Left is not an analyst but a lowlife punk with some entertainment value in the street. Most of analysts upgraded or raised target price on TWTR after the 3rd Q earning. JP morgen even picks TWTR as one of the top three stocks in 2019. TWTR will go over $40 after delieving 4th Q earning, which should be very good."
More shorts for short-sqeeze!!!
TWTR is now DOWN by 13% since Mon. -- a loss of $5.2 BILLION in market cap. The stock could easily drop to the $20's where it traded last June. Look out below!
"A spokesman for the previous Adminisrtation, himself a sleep-aid marketer, announced on behalf of David Dennison and John Barron that Rudy Giuliani was hardly known by either David Dennison or John Barron and only worked for the Administration for a very short period of time and in a very limited role. The previous Administration went on to wish Mr. Giuliani the very best in his new profession as a Public Vehicle Undercarriage Inspector.

How come AOC & the Squids refuse to migrate to the southern border and see first hand the crisis they helped create? Are they afraid the thousands of illegal children will have drained all the toilets and there will be nothing for them to drink when they get there?
What a mess. Now the board will need to decide what to do. The last thing they want is a shareholder revolt and litigation. The board has several options that might save this company. If it drops another 15% then expect employee layoffs & a new CEO. .

"Ouch, down once again. What a mess caused by the CEO."
Losing half your customers in a weekend and more following the exodus will destroy twit. Clearly investors were the last thing they cared about. On Twit the plan is a massive short attack. You won’t recover bc you’ve lost the base. It’s over. Watch for gab to go public. Free speech and own platform: TV Social media payment processing search engine...designing phones. All detached from goog amazon and apple. It’s over
BSE. Best short ever.
"Twitter went public 11/7/2013, about 5 years and 3 months ago at $26/share. Today, it is sustainably profitable, with about 3.5 billion in annual sales and with no like competition. The world reacts on twitter. Think what you like but it is becoming the repository of human interaction, good and bad. It has the tremendous potential of being of great strategic value, both in terms of its earnings and unique Customer Base, to some Entity. So you have to ask yourself that at today’s selling price of about $30 per share, is there no more value for this company to grow in to? I say it remains a huge opportunity for a media conglomerate to own, control and reap from. Twitter’s deficiencies are being worked out, albeit slower than to our liking, but nevertheless improving and inviting to most who use this platform. GLTA."
down with censorship and communism!!
"I'm SO GLAD I WAS FINALLY ABLE TOGET OUT TODAY ! Now, On To Better OpportunitiesWith $500K+ In Capital Not Tied Up !"

TWTR is up about 35% after booting DJT off its platform for toxic posts advocating election theft. That's what you call the application of sound business principles.
"While I do not agree people will be deleting Twitter, I have seen the number of pickups on phones have dropped by over 90% a day since I stopped checking all day what Trump was tweeting about. If even a small percentage of the user base is also checking this much less, I can only presume forecasted projections will be dismal this next earnings call."

Full circle is coming for some of the largest businesses in our country imo. Many businesses like Twitter have become social justice warriors shifting away from corporate values that focus on social welfare and environment. This is a big mistake. Politics don't sell. The consumer always has the last word.

This was upgraded. CNBC said to buy. Why is it going down?
Rush said he deactivated his Twitter account. He has 88.6 million followers. Good for him.
- Already unprofitable company - Just expelled its biggest asset - Just alienated half of the U.S.Might be a good time to sell.
Twitter is Toast. Younger millennials don't use it. All the Trumpers have left to other app's. Attracting new users is going to be very difficult for them.

You can post video about Tiananmen Square on Twitter. You can even post the photos showing those that didn’t make it. Not sure what the problem is.
The US has 3 or 4 times as many COVID19 cases as China or India and they both have over 3 billion people while the US only has a little over 300 million. It’s a shame the previous administration didn’t take COVID19 more seriously. Remember “only 15 cases soon to be zero” or “it’s fully contained and will disappear like magic.”The US now has 25 MILLION COVID19 cases.

"Should be in green tomorrow, huge beat on revenue"
"Twitter announced today that they acquired Revue, a tiny private company located in the Netherlands that has 6 employees, that's right- 6 employees. It is reasonable to assume that this start-up firm is bleeding red ink and welcomed a buyer before it was forced to declare bankruptcy (remember, the majority of small businesses fail). If Revue is the reason Twitter is up today, it is a ludicrous reaction, and a temporary upward moment as Twitter's negative fundamentals have not changed."
This company is like those oily dotcom bust companies from the Y2K era. Smoke and mirrors and nothing behind them. I don't trust a thing Jack and his smoke and mirror guys say. Nothing.
"Years too recover... maybe never. VZ might would buy it, they bought Yahoo for some pocket change!"

Looks like a stock that is ready to dip
"Politics aside, this company still isn’t profitable and it’s usership has already peaked. What a scam. They had over a $1B loss this year in net earnings in what has been a record year for social media useage due to the pandemic and it still has almost a $40B valuation. OUCH. (You all should buy this stock, maybe it will only lose $950M next year)."
"Now that the Dennison Empire is experiencing a severe drop in revenue, I would encourage the Faithful, the ""Special"" people and the ""Loved"" people to send generous donation checks to Mar-a-Lago. This one is legit, not to be confused with either the Foundation or the University.Income at Mar-a-Lago has dropped significantly. Thankfully the agreement that Mar-a-Lago would not be used as a residence will be ignored and Mar-a-Lago (the ""Club"", not the residence) will be able to continue to bill the US taxpayer for food, lodgings and golf cart rentals to the Secret Service.I would also urge you to send all your legal work to Mr. Giuliani to support him in these difficult times and to buy MAGA-branded My Pillows to support the downtrodden among us. That it all. Continue on Bigly.Bigly. Believe me. Conthief! MAGA - My Account Got Axed?"

At least Moses was responding to his people falling into idolatry. @Jack is trying to run the world by censorship and manipulation of the public narrative. ILLEGAL..."

The social media platform will eventually make these notes more visible on tweets for its global audience.While it remains in a testing phase, the notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site.""We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,"" Twitter said.Related Link: Tesla Seeks A 'Specialist' To Address 'Social Media Escalations' Aimed At CEO Elon MuskWhy It's Important: Twitter's initiative follows interviews with more than 100 individuals ""across the political spectrum,"" the company said. There was ""broad general support"" for Birdwatch that helps evaluate the trustworthiness of a tweet.""We know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying,"" Twitter said.What's Next: Twitter will focus on how to prevent manipulative practices in its initiative and ensure it isn't dominated by a simple majority."
"I have been holding TWTR since 2015. Whew, patience finally pays off. Compared to SNAP, TWTR is only a bit more than 50% of SNAP market cap. I am sure Twitter has lots of room to go from here if the comparison with Snapchat is justified: Twitter has 330m subscribers, vs Snap 250m. Additionally, TWTR has tangible earnings, vs Snapchat is still losing money.Go TWTR"
"Every time I post a comment about how the Democrats will ruin the economy, stock market, and country it will get deleted, if people on here who are censoring these comments disagree with that and think things will be just fine 2, 3, or 4 years from now why would they sensor a #$%$ statement then......I will tell you, because they know it is true and that many people who voted against Trump will look back 3 or 4 years from now and wish they had voted for him and just kept silent about it!"
Jack Dorsey gave $10 million to a race indoctrinator for the sole purpose of poisoning the minds of young children. This is one of the many faces of your enemy and mine.
"This will trade below $40 by end of week, $30 or less by March, $20 or less by June."
I can't criticize Kamala without being deleted. Why is she more entitled to free speech than me. I spent 6 years in the Military to protect all Americans rights. Let's see if this gets deleted.

"“The mob was fed lies,” McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”"
twtr is falling off the cliff due to retaliation from withdrawing President Trump account...caused millions of subscribers withdraw their account with twtr as well ...too bad to hold for long term investment...most likely gonna be very bad commimg quarter e/r....
Jack telling the investors everything will be fine....
Definite Pump and Dump going on. MKM Partners? I'm a fund manager and that's the first I've ever heard of them. Short this. The Financial Media are manipulating the gullible same as always. Meanwhile world leaders in other countries are condemning Twitter and Facebook.
I’m proud to say I sent 22 eviction notices last week. Only to my liberal tenants. Cancel culture can be fun for conservatives too!
Hey Jack...
Can’t stop a stock that wants to go down
Twitter downhill from here
beat on earning
https://nypost.com/2021/01/21/twitter-sued-for-allegedly-refusing-to-remove-child-porn/
Twitter is in the toilet. It’s throwing away money to buy this stock.
"Bleeding won't stop until we get some new numbers concerning account losses. Check out sensor tower and see the lower engagement, google trends also shows a spike and now a drop in interest."
Stock is going too high...lol
Very pricy even at $34
"Would not hold into 2/9 earnings report, going to be a bloodbath of red"
How many people are going to quit Twitter now? Who even cares about Twitter? It could disappear and the world would be better off.
"DATA HARVESTING, that's what Twitter and Facebook is really about. They have been caught selling your personal information to third-parties, they even sell it to dodgy bad actors outside the USA. This is fundamentally why there are so many data breeches, people have your information, and will use it to defraud you."
Changes in followers. @MikePence: -80k @Jim_Jordan: -160k @DailyCaller: -90k || @JoeBiden: + 1 million @KamalaHarris: +600k @AOC: +300k. Safe to say that many of those are new. I don't think $TWTR is losing a lot of users.
"Remove it from the s&p, belongs on Shanghai index."

"some big money holding this up, but why? no future for a losing company"
I bought puts options but Twitter keeps going up
"One thing is obvious from Dorsey's response yesterday. America has changed as we know it. Liberals running wild, freedom of speech is being lost, hypocrites all over the place. Elite becoming more elite, the every day common man (opps person) is being lost in this country. Big tech getting more powerful, we are on our way to a socialist or Communist country. China, Russia, Iran all laughing in our face. We are DOG poop.Remember though--- what causes uprisings and grass roots movements??? These events do. People do not like being silenced, they want their voices heard. Remember 2022 is coming. Send a message. It all tarts with the House. Get some common sense and real Americans in the House. Put Nancy out to pasture. Fore the SQUAD. Its all up to you. Take your country back. Peacefully. And why not???"
"Wow, opening 9% higher!"
"Would be banned by more countries and the number of users is dropping rapidly, why risk your hard-earned money on TWTR?? SELL and GO ARKK, ARKQ, ARKG, ARKW!"
New America = Censorship! Liberals should be so proud.
"koo koo koo, that sounds as end of twitter in india and the same will be replicated in different countries. Twitter has very less significance in cross border."
I don't really see the intransic value of investing in twitter bird .
It's no accident the CEO looks a like Carl Marx. One thing in the U.S.A is we as American's can invoke Capital Markets punishment on the Stock by Selling TWTR to Bankruptcy which indeed will occur over the Next 6 months when it's only major client and voice of the last four years leaves. It was going to happen anyway their was no way that Trump Organization would not be setting up it's own media networks day's after the President left office anyway. The CEO of TWTR knew that and so did we. The U.S. Capital Markets will invoke justice on TWTR. Then they will get it!
"guys follow me on parler @DropShock and leave a comment so I can follow you back, we need to support each other and build parler up into a competitor for these liberal tech giants. also remember to deactivate your accounts and not just delete the apps that way during the earnings call it shows as a massive drop in users to really get the point across"
"Jo Bydung has hired 14 current and former executives from the BIG 5 tech firms to advise his transition team..this should make the little hairs on your neck stand up, after what we have just witnessed..Sell Baby!!"

This site is only for people able to critically think. moc.ecnediveehtsiereh . It has to be typed backwards for it to post on yahoo. If you don't believe my try typing it and pasting it forward to see the censorship for yourself. What are they afraid of you seeing ?

Why won’t Twitter remove hateful antifa accounts if they care so much about inciting violence?

Never ever invest or use services of politically biased company. Anything you post on left wing social media they don't like will come back to haunt you.
The stock is defying gravity. Fundamentals do not indicate that there is going to be explosive bottom line growth in this stock.
Lots of supporters of Twatters here like Chuck who likes chock. I bet they are all flaming like their beloved closeted Jackie Dorset.
TWTR is a company that makes no profit and hates and censors their customers. It may not be a viable company in a year as it starts to face new competition.

Why doesn't TWTR close down the accounts of AuntTeefuh thugs? They are a known domestic terrorist organization yet their accounts remain active. Obviously TWTR is run by Marxist Leninists who support a radical agenda. These people are vermin and there's only one effective way to deal with vermin.

"Subscribers going down is very bad news for an ad-driven revenue model. Their ""inventory"" of impressions generated by traffic will be down big, which means lower revenue per ad. This is just economics--as revenue per ad goes down, they need to sell more ads but they won't have the inventory--there's only so many ""eyeballs"" you can sell. Imagine Apple having to lower prices on iphones, but not having more iphones to sell--they could make more; how will Twitter generate more traffic? If tens of millions of subscribers have deactivated, how do you get more subscribers to join? This is a death spiral, folks."

Twitter longs - you were warned repeatedly that this would gap down at some point. You have not seen the gap down yet - this is just the begginning. It will not be long before you will be wishing you could go back and sell at these levels. This literally may be a single digit stock real soon.

"There is one way we can send a message to the powers that be, and that is to use the tremendous power of our money. Sure Twitter is a target for bears ( and rightfully so) but there is something else at work here other than that. If conservatives can organize and solidify around one central principle and that is”You don’t spend your wealth on items or services that are leftist leaning companies of all types.” But first you must organize your own wallet. Control your money and we’ll what they say then. More to"
"MOST people on the right who are #$%$ off with Twitter haven't left yet as they don't want to be disconnected entire. Most people on the left will ALSO exit as they don't have Trump to hate on every day anymore. It's already boring and will only be more boring as Biden will suddenly have to actually LEAD instead of blaming every paper cut or stubbed toe on Trump. So once everything is resolved in DC the current exodus will like a slow drip compared to the tsunami who will drop twitter in 2-3 months. Not to mention those who ONCE KNEW letting everyone speak their mind, even when you vehemently disagree with them, IS an American value, they TOO will exit twitter for taking such a dictatorial heavy hand. And once they go, they will NEVER come back. Check out Fox News, NFL, NBA, if you do not believe losing your audience in THIS manner, is PERMANENT. Twitter will NEVER have MANY of these users ever again. There is also a coming Facebook exodus...it will be very strong as well. Feb-March timeframe enjoy the downward slides shorting these stocks."

I would like a place where everyone is happy. Obviously Twitter CEO is against that.
It is just a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half.
"Where will $TWTR stock price go without regard to financials, just charts?==> Get into CHART for $TWTR. Using the 1 month chart, select +Comparison add PINS.What gap do you see?

All Americans should make money!"
"Socialism believes if that the individual is nothing, the state/government is everything. If you fail to believe like you are told, and don't accept government regulation and control over everything, you are the problem to be dealt with (job loss, persecution in all its forms, threats). Twitter is merely another instrument of coercion--coercion is evil and is not acceptable."

Sell sell sell sell sell
I think maybe there should be a lawsuit from the shareholders against the company...... for not disclosing to the shareholders what they were going to do
Over bought
Keep shorting.
Longs I see a big Red Candle coming.
Stay short. Will not hit 20 in a straight line until after earnings
Breaking News... Parler will be back soon.!!!! ..Twitts are finished..

"All it took was for me to sell some shares after holding for over 3 years. Still have a 6 figure position. Just would have been a little bigger; congrats to long term holders, and to those with low entry points."

The Demon-crats Minister for Propaganda Jack Dorsey makes a public appearance.
If you are still using Twitter you are now at extreme risk of being targeted by cyber criminal attacks!
I set price alert at 20
Last five it should slip
"like a blue homing pigeon, heading for the gap at 59.88."
Considering what Dorsey is doing to people who do not have the same political ideology as he... Twitter should crash...which is what he deserves. Too bad others have to suffer for his evil doing.
I am hoping this company goes out of business....
OMG ... 'TrumpTV' will be Armageddon for Jackoff's little Twitter.
Institutional ownership has dropped from 81% to 76% over the last week.

I just deactivated my Twitter account...:somehow I feel “cleaner”. LMAO!
"Jack Dorsey issued a statement. It reads ""REEEEEEEE""."
Delete twitter fast.
Dobbie canceled by Fox. One America will sign him.
"$PINS valuation has a lot of room to run. Compare $PINS mkt cap (55B) to $SNAP (96B), Airbnb $ABNB (129B), $DASH (71B), or $SPOT (68B). The big 3 $FB, $TWTR, and $GOOG face political/regulatory headwinds, and $AMZN is probably going to get scrutiny too. $PINS stands to benefit."
February 9 is doomsday for Twitter. Let?s see if they can #$%$ their way out of their earnings.
Jack Dorsey intentionally and willfully torpedoed his own company. But it’s not his to do that with anymore. It belongs to millions of people owning those 751 million shares.In discussing with legal experts all of us who have been impacted negatively would be wise to form the largest class action suit in history.
I bet the stock is down at least 10% tomorrow.

"If you have a Masters in Business Administration you just witness Twitter voluntary “flipping porters 5 forces” and inviting a new entrance.If you do not have an MBA, twitter decided it would no longer be a monopoly and committed suicide.￼If you are a share holder, you may have a claim against leadership and the company for BAD leadership as actions take are not in the best interest of the company BUT in the interest of leaderships opinion at shareholders expense.

nice short
IMHO tweeter/Facebook will be shut down next week
Lots of political rant about Twitter. My issue is that it’s perhaps detrimental to hear from people in blips and blurbs through out the day. There’s no real need for it. Society is just getting used to social media. All social media have challenges. But I feel like Twitter even more than others appeals to people’s worse angels. So for that reason and at this price I’m not a fan
"AOC spewing more censorship and a commission to rein in MEDIA.Maybe she should rein in herself, get on a row boat, and paddle to Siberia."
Supposedly twitter usage is down 20% right now.

sold the remainer of my shares at 72.55... Good luck everybody
I expect Twitter will go down in history as the worst company in the world

Twitter is not for long term investment. It is good for swing traders. CEO is mentally unstable so does stock price
This stock has zero retail support and is being held up completely by hedge funds using their wealthy clients money.
Be prepared if you own Twitter time to get out. Internet providers are canceling Twitter on there platforms!!Stock is going to drop like a rock!! by June I estimate it will be at 10 bucks!!
"Wow, down 3%. Parler is now up and running. If you like big government, like to be told what to do & what to think, then stay with Twitter. If you love our country, love our flag, love our way of life then cancel Twitter and join us at Parler."
Ouch! Down 2.5% and the trends look bad. Could it be because of Parler?

"Sue Jack, Save Freedom.""In recent days I’ve been made aware of dozens of conversations by former Twitter users that thousands of people might not only be eligible to sue #BigTweet but expect a bit of a payday in doing so.Beginning the day following the January 6th activities in Washington, DC, Jack Dorsey got aggressive, hostile, and intentional in the mishandling of his enterprise.The argument that Twitter—as a private company—can do what they wish with impunity is holding less water as the scope of the malfeasance is coming to light.By estimates from my own observation and discussion with others, Dorsey intentionally maligned the welfare of his company. In most publicly traded corporations this would be tolerated for no more than a nanosecond.His actions intentionally injured the return on investment of shareholders and taking such actions violated the basic fiduciary rights investors expect to be upheld. Given that the top 10 owners of the 751 million shares of Twitter’s stock are all financial services and mutual fund companies there are a lot of shareholders that have said expectations.And last week Jack Dorsey purposely and with malice of forethought made all of them take a bath. He did so without any justification for his actions as it pertained to the welfare of the corporation. His actions caused the company to lose 16 percent of stock value—close to $7 billion in actual dollars—and in essence killed its ability to deliver its number one product: an audience.So there are plenty of reasons shareholders, the public, and former Twitter users should consider legal recourse."""
tweet will end red today!!!!
Deactivated my account!

"Keep up the pressure Nancy! They must be punished, all of them. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to House Democrats on Monday plans for the creation of a ""9/11-type commission"" to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.""To protect our security, our security, our security, our next step will be to establish an outside, independent 9/11-type Commission to 'investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex,'"" Pelosi wrote."

"Great to see local Los Angeles business owners support Project Roomkey. With 50,000 empty hotel rooms in the city and tens of thousands of homeless it’s a pretty amazing opportunity. FEMA will back the funds, it puts the hotels back in business, and the people will have dignity. This isn’t the stuff Elon Musk steps up to do. No money in helping homeless, they can’t use a dog coin."
Insider selling at SQ. Wonder if they are trying to prop up Twitter's stock price?

"Further thoughts on the upgrade... today is the day that margin calls would be completed. If someone had a large Twitter position and needed to dump it, issuing the upgrade today would make lots of sense... Down from here."
Retraced on weak volume; a drop on increase volume is coming before the close.
"When at least 50% of the population value their First Amendment right of free speech, that does bode well for companies that actively try to censor it. I cannot imagine Twitter or Facebook will do well until this issue is resolved."
surprised people are willing to hold this over the weekend. I would expect monday next week to be another gap down day to start another down week.
Larry s inching 60. Hooray 
"Do the following facts indicate a buying or selling/shorting opportunity for Twitter: negative earnings, no dividend, small number of shares shorted, controversial CEO, lawsuit filed against the company for child sexual abuse on Jan, 20, recent loss of up to 100 million platform users, and the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab. Seems clear to me that the stock price of Twitter is more likely to go down than up."
"A lot of calls and puts above and below the current price, expiring Friday. I wouldn’t be surprised if it traded around the current price until then."
f' look @ ACRX we have a news leak!! ACRX up huge on record Volume!!$fb $aapl buy & hold

"People never left, never sold. All talk."
"Birdwatch is akin to the Politburo of the Communist Party, Twitter is just an Orwellian echo chamber. Use an alternative one that supports a diversity of opinion."
Twitter should let the Terrorist-in-chief back on then kick him off for another ten-dollar rise in price.
the share price is now equal to the average I Q of a democrat
This will soon be like MySpace... We’ll all look back and laugh that we used this service once...
This is very clearly being held up by the establishment. They can only do that for so long tho. Only a matter of time before we see 30s!

how high we going on pump?
"Looking at the stock price, I’m guessing that TWTR is making boatloads of money!"
"Forget shorting Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook. Those companies are not nearly as vulnerable to business drop as Twitter is. They will do their own thing tomorrow, but Twitter will be dying like there is no tomorrow."
This company made themselves a tgt. That does not align with what I want as a share holder!
Their earnings in Feb will show a big drop in subscribers. I wouldn’t hold this stock into earnings.
I spent close to two hours on hold trying to place a trade at Fidelity but was unable to get to anyone. Has anyone else experienced the same horrible service?#c #fb #hbi #twtr
"Lets remember back....Twitter was in the RED prior to the president getting an account. NOW they have eliminated him and many of his followers.....HMMM....where is Twitter headed....to the sewer.Florida now seeking to divest the state of Twitter, FB, Apple, Google and Amazon...Good luck to those companies."
All this noise and it’s down $2.84 form all time high. Keep chasing
I gave Twitter the worst rating in an Apple store. I also wrote a scathing critique of them. Do the same. I wish this company would go bankrupt. That anyone who invests in it will lose all their money.
Deleted my account and not going back!
As it now appears the titans of MSM/SocialMedia together with the DeepState/Socialist/Marxist/Globalist cabal have won. No other reason to explain the Orwellian stock of Twtr to rise other than that. But 1st impressions can be misleading. It's either a Republic or an arm of the CCP.
Just realized Ive lost more twitter follwers than Sleepy Joe has supporters.
"Traders who attempted to cancel the sale were met with a message telling them the sale couldn’t be undone, “as we placed it to mitigate the risk to your account.”"
You should really try not using Twitter or FB for a week. The effects are truly surprising.
This tuerd will not float. Artificially propped up.
"Up today on very light volume. When their very negative fundamentals kick-in, this stock is going to fall like Jimmy Hoffa's cement tomb in the middle of a lake."
"Do you all aware that every time the day after Twitter release earning report, market crash ! This happened many many times already!"
So how much do you think it will be tomorrow? -10%? -20% -30%?

"As an ex-investor of TWTR (sold at $54.45 in December, thank you very much), it's clear they're no longer interested in profits or shareholders. While Dorsey's bagged his mega-millions, his business model is now social engineering. Investor beware."
It’s Un-American to have an account with these 2 communist owned companies. $TWTR $FB
"How come when I call out someone’s lies on this board, my message gets deleted?"
now they bring in thousands of national guard before they demonized them and the police. This is a joke.These large companies have too much power and are hurting everyday Americans. I hope this stock falls big time.

Twitter going down because it's financially unable to make money. and that's good because they are enemy of people and censor tool. besides Jihadi Jack is addicted to different heavy drugs and can't think at all.

Bigly?...but, but, but Obama, but, but, but Hillary, but, but, but, putt, putt, putt..."
Jack is probably surrounded by 10 guys 24hrs a day right now.
it is not like twitter has any real assets. It is valued on the number of users and how long they stay on the platform. Other countries besides ours are waking up to the threat of big tech. It is just not the U.S. anymore.
Hope this goes to $10

I think FB could see more Instagram account cancellation."

"Jack Dorsey for ""Man of the Year"" for eliminating the cesspool of social media, Parler!"
TwTr should be 19
"Might be worth investing in if it dips 20% or more within a few days time. Until then, ill just watch."
"lawsuits comings, i think we will see 30 by June"
Josh Hawley is one of my HEROES.....
down 20% already !! let’s make it 50%!!! take Dorsey on a reality check!
Any other stock with news of this magnitude would be all over the news. You try to find an article or discussion on any of these platforms about what’s going to happen to this stock tomorrow......it’s crickets.
"Sorry to here the polar Vortex , which was predicted, is going to cause hardship in USA. Solar And Wind power doesn’t cut it! Natural gas when it’s cold is the way to go."
It’s rather appropriate that this thing takes a deep dive. It’s lost billions of shareholders money through absolutely horrific management and decision making. The real question is how do freaks like Dorsey get into positions like this??
"Uh oh, Parler's back. Twitter faces headwinds in the market for spite, bitterness and bile."
"Sell Twitter stock, there are major problems coming in the stock. There is insider info leaking out"
"Twitter will retrace, as its negative fundamentals remain: negative earnings, no dividend, loss of half its users, growth of competitors, and child sex abuse law suits."
"I was a dam builder, I’ll fly a starship to the reaches of the other side.Or I may be a single drop of rain.But I’ll be back again and again and again."
"As the country is taken back to prior to 1871 and the United States Corp, now bankrupt, is now under the guidance of the Constitution and not the elite, Zuck, Dorsey, Google, Gates and all the horrifics will be brought down. It's all a matter of a short period of time."
Press that buy button.
So glad to see people making money on this. GL GL GL

Amazon now has joined the censorship sweeping America by cutting off their servers to Parler effective at midnight. Conspiracy theories need no further introduction as Big Tech hasshown they the true conspirators trying to destroy America.
See you @ 18. Fruitcakes
"Private enterprises do not operate under a free speech requirement for users, particularly those users who repeatedly violate terms of service. Most schoolchildren understand that simple point."
Yahoo story on Ashli Babbitt is disgusting. The left wingers regularly try to turn career criminals into martyrs whenever they get shot by police while committing yet another crime - but when an UNARMED 14 year Air Force vet who is conservative gets killed by Capitol police then they present it in a totally different light.
Getting pretty close to $100... bring the hate!
Everyone be sure to thank a Veteran . They fought for our right to freedom of speech. We as civilians failed them. I for one am ashamed and deeply sorry. They bled on foreign soil for it and we paid big tech to take it away. To any vet reading this thank you so much. I vow to do better
Will fade..good opportunity too add too short here
"Jack Goebbels Dorsey is learning that the more he censors, the more the Wall St. cheerleaders will pump his stock."

In 2018 the top 1% of wage earners paid 615 billion in taxes. The bottom 90% paid 440 billion. I'm just making a factual comment and watch I'll get some thumbs down.
Selling intensifying
"A real schlapp in the face when Twitter users saw the obvious odal rune shape at cpac. It wasn’t even hidden. German police train school children from 4 on up, on how to recognize these symbols and turn people in. Because Germany is actually smart about the rising Turner-Don Diary movement. I would feel sorry for these cpac-ers, but really why? They promote the white protestsnt work morality. And while I can sympathize with small businesses owners who are strapped, especially during the pandemic, if a profit margin depends on paying employees a wage that keeps them on the edge of poverty if not deep in it, the fault is in the business plan. This holds true for the multi-national, or bank, with their hand out for taxpayer assistance, that isn’t also given to the taxpayer at equal levels. Remember, cpac speakers didn’t want to give any stimulus."
This is falling a long way today after Project Veritas let out the tape of Dorsey.

"Of the first 13 arrested in Capitol Hill unrest, zero had Parler accounts. The vast majority of planning or discussion of heading to Capitol Hill took place on Facebook and YouTube. Google owns YouTube so they can’t possibly block their own site. Big Tech must be sanctioned, financially penalized and broken up in a way that this never happens again. Imagine if these tech companies were based in China and had banned our President. Wouldn’t we ALL be standing unitedly against it?https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9131977/amp/Parler-squeezed-Trump-seeks-new-online-megaphone.html"

"Man, those shorters and boycotters are just doing a number on this stock much alike the destruction they caused to Nike. On another note, Peter Navarro (a Turnip-worshiper) now claims that 'old Billy Barr was part of the Deep State coup against the Mango Mussolini. I know, I know.....I saw it on Faux News and it's an alternative fact but as soon as the story is backed up by the National Enquirer, you know it's the truth........"
So glorious to see Twitter and longs win out here after dropping dmbazz! Lol. Magnificent.
Can dementia Joe even remember the nuclear codes if he needs it?
"#cancelTwitter. Best of luck to those who support this company. I can't support a company that bans non-violent free speech, and doesn't know the difference between allegations and lies."
I have been on Twitter ( not any more ) and parler and there is far more hate on twitter then I ever saw on parler..Those who believe Parler was a hate site have never used it and only believe what the media tells them which is sad and scary..Sad they believe the media and scary if the media says jump off the building they will

I think being a stock analyst requires no knowledge. MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni upgraded TWTR a couple days ago. Who in the world would upgrade a company in the middle of their customers leaving in droves.

"Not to be outdone by his counterpart in Albany, the illegit twit, dementia patient in the WH is embarking on his own campaign to see how many people he can marginalize by removing them from this earth. Thanks to the reckless immigration policies of this sham administration 15 people, albeit illegals, were transformed into placemats when the vehicle they were stacked in, like cord wood, collided with a semi along the border with Mexico. The logical response from this abomination of an administration would be to provide busses with a police escort, at the taxpayers expense, to ensure they make it to the sanctuary city of their choosing where they can hide out until Boondoggle Bydoon can wave his magic wand and pronounce them ""legal citizens"".BTW. Twitter stock is junk. Short this  to $20."

In hindsight we can clearly see the drag on this company was the twitterer in chief who got booted and then the rocket ship launched.
I am shorting this for America...
LOL.... Falling! Didn’t even take an hour 
I sold at 65. I was going to sell the day before earning but when brenda announced she was selling I decided to hold through earnings... I also announced that holding through earning was the best thing that you could do...

"Just pulled this from an article published today from Tipbanks:Rosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz believes that the ban could pose significant hurdles to the company’s 2021 mDAUs (monetizable daily active users) and ad revenue “on top of already tough COVID user compares,” which he estimates added about 3 million and 15 million incremental US and outside US mDAUs (estimated), respectively, last year.Zgutowicz further stated that his scenario analyses indicated that the ban could wipe off 6 million-9 million US mDAUs this year. The analyst argued that the move, along with tough COVID-induced user growth comparables, leave the company a “little room to deliver positive ’21 results.” The analyst reiterated a Hold rating on Twitter and lowered his price target slightly to $39 from $40."

I thought freedom of speech is when you can voice a different perspective on truth. The research you do to make a winning stock trade should also be made in how you understand the news ! Follow a variety of news outlets and watch a half hour each day of MSNBC FOX CNN and even 15 minutes of NEWSMAX. By doing this you will have a great balance on what the truth is. If you follow news on the net such as Twitter or Facebook and focus on as many as two similar articles whether positive or negative those platform's algorithms will feed you similar stories backing up the same view. This puts people in a herd of thinkers that could follow lies and false beliefs. These algorithms are not acceptable to freedom of finding the truth ! It could lead many down a dark rabbit hole. Many who lost work because of covid shut downs seemed to want to follow reasons why they lost their jobs. Its because of covid and I feel their pain. Just as the algorithmic codes run the stock market we still do our research to see the truth.please understand sites like Twitter and Facebook haven't focused on what's true because they make greater fees if they take you down whatever rabbit hole you choose. Remember your worth more than your financial success. Things will get better you have to have social emotional physical and spiritual success in your life to be balanced. I know most or at least many feel financial success may be the greatest of them all ! Know that covid has tested each of us and many are fed-up with life ! This time in our history will soon pass and brighter days are ahead.
"u longs, sell at 7am"
Why would anybody buy a company that increase 2-10% over a year and no dividends but donate the shareholders dividends to leftist group. There are millions of companies that values increase 10-20% in a day.
Look at the 1-month chart. It is beautiful. Jack's wealth dropping like an anvil.
"TWTR stock without profits, no dividend yield and the earning per share -1.58.I don't believe that the retail investors spend over 40 bucks/shr to invest to this Junk. Financial institution hold this Junk now they want to get out, so they trade back & forth to PUMP & DUMP this Junk. Watch out for the trap..."
This company is a dog waiting to die. They are propping it up as much as possible but when earnings comes out it's going to be a catastrophe don't wait around for the big red candles. they are going to have to explain to shareholders what the hell they were thinking? the trouble is there is no explanation for their communist censorship Behavior

"$AMZN - Now that Amazon is being sued by Parler for removing them from their hosting site AWS for allegedly violating Amazon's standards, will they be inclined to remove $TWTR and $FB, two of their largest clients for the same reasons? People post violence and threats all day long on FB and TWTR."

The little blue bird is down substantially in after hours trading. This market closes at 8 pm. Better sell immediately before it drops even further. Tomorrow will be a brutal day for Big Tech companies like Twitter.

The announcement, made at a press conference in a parking lot across the street from Graceland, Presley’s longtime home, was seen as a bid to prevent QAnon from vanishing altogether.The overture to the Elvis conspiracy theorists came after QAnon proposed a similar merger with the National Rifle Association, which declined, citing difficulties of its own."

I never had an issue with any of the platforms, I just found myself living through them more and more and had to make a change. One of the best decisions i could've ever made. My life and overall mindset has improved greatly over the last year. I still have many open accounts that I am deleting today. I hope this catches on and sticks because I really do feel that it is for the better of every single individual person. Go out and talk face to face with people, so that you can develope real relationships with real emotions. It is natural and healthy."
"Parler is back online.They must be getting swamped by customers, because I wasn't even able to log on yesterday."
"It's Saturday, January 16, 2021. Who is Jack Goebbels Dorsey censoring today? You know brownshirts don't rest on weekends."
Who’s ready for another fabulous day of shorting this turd? Option market shows more bleeding. Puts outweigh the calls 3-1...
"My today’s Twitter prediction..It will open down 4 bucks, and by afternoon the sellers will bring it down hard closing around 40."
Drop yahoo for deleting comments!
TWTR= SOLD. (Thanks for the +40% gains. See ya!)
Head and shoulders
Social media's role in stealing the election for Kamala did not go unnoticed by governments around the world. None will trust Twitter and their ilk from now on. Litigation and regulation is in Jack's future all around the world.
Is (was) this the new Gamestop? It5 is only a matter of time where mental health experts will start telling people ot get off Twit and Fookface
When will Jack take a stand against IRAN? We are waiting jack.
"WHAT IF - Conservative Americans started suddenly disappearing from the streets of America, but there was no open, unbiased and objective FREE PRESS to report where they had been taken and what was happening to them? Sound familiar??"
This stock is gonna “GE” on you.
In my opinion companies should be politically neutral and focus on business.
"The dementia patient posing as a legitimate POTUS is weak. Iran knows it. Russia knows it. China knows it. Enjoy $4.00 gas this summer and criminal illegal aliens roaming your neighborhoods. Under this poser it's America last and our enemies first. Having trouble getting your Covid 19 shot? Leave the country and enter illegally through the Southern border and you'll get you shot right away. Si señor, señora?"
Next week we go to the 30s
"I understand why the reactionary right is all het up about treasonists getting booted off of twitter, but it's really a mixed blessing for them. What they want most is to be an aggrieved minority. This is a gift."
Suckers rally Shorting the heck out of this No one interesting tweets anymore
Byyyyyeeee Twitter
"TWTR is the most overvalued big tech stock. Now it's #1 carnival attraction is gone, get ready for a slaughter"

The Communist Leftards love Twitter
Brenda i thought you sold all your shares in the high 50s the day before earnings?
Look for the Sherman Act to be used against big tech. The leadership should also be sued when shares tank.
"Ever ask yourself why 75 million people STILL believe this election was stolen? Maybe it’s just me but people don’t like having their candidates chosen for them. Everyone saw what they saw and no matter how much propaganda you cannot erase this criminality out of the heads of that many people. It was in your face and overt. Big Tech fully complicit in this criminal behavior and Jack, et al should be prosecuted under the RICO statutes. Sell ."
"Anything going exponential, always and I repeat always has a tragic end. They are just flushing out Puts and shorts right now. The fall of TWTR will be spectacular."
It's a Sure 100% Bet that TWTR will be in the 30's by Friday. It dropped $2.00 or 4% After Houres on Friday! Expect it to open in the $45.50 and Drop to $39.
"Just changed from Neutral to BearishBollinger Band (2 stdev above/below using 20 day moving average) says we are way above top 2 stdev (over bought).Return price is $52.82. NO NEED TO BELEIVE ME, DO IT YOURSELF! It is what it is. Going short. Have been NEUTRAL (double check me again) but when you get beyond 2+ stdev, things tend to fall hard. AGAIN, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!"
Heading back down.

I understand banning extreme right-wing nut jobs. But an entire political party??? That is the exact definition of fascism...
Twitter was a fad that is going away. So many better cos to invest in.....good bye twitter as millions cancel accts
"Telegram Sees 25 Million New Users in 72 HoursMessaging app Telegram has seen a massive surge in new users, largely by those concerned about their privacy."
"Twitter also controlled tweets directed at liberal politicians. Your tweet will appear but no one can see it , this is how bad their censorship has gotten."
this stock will be cheaper than a subway sandwich come this summer.
i wish someone would do a large market sell order already 
Parler boys said they were going to bankrupt Twitter.

If you wanna see what they hiding from you on the news might want to check out moc.ecnediveehtsiereh . I had to write it backwards cuz yahoo doesn't want you to see this site. If you don't believe me try typing it forwards and posting it to see what happens.
Thanks Parler people! Bought some twtr early today. Nice profit!! Keep up the good covering.
All you need to do is look at the March 19 way out of the $ Puts are all up big today and ask why? Earnings report in Feb will be a disaster when they have to disclose how many users deleted their accounts. Time is running out to get out!
Huge loses coming tomorrow or Monday...Jack was just caught on hidden camera talking about his political agenda. project veritas will be releasing the video tomorrow I believe.
"Let's go America, keep selling!"
This stock will slowly bleed to its true price
"Hungary now warning TWTR, FB . Recommending EU action. Crush the techno-fascist oligarchs from Silicon Valley."
"The drop is in progress. Low 61s and if it closes the after hours in the 60s, premarket will see the ugly truth come out in the form of a major drop n the stock price."

"This is against logic. Yesterday earnings are no better than the previous ones where each time, it was dropping 20-30%. And this time should be the same. Otherwise it is manipulation."
This just a trickle of what’s to come. Mass exodus 1/20/21.#TWEXIT
Thank you Joe! We FINALLY have a president who will look out for the working class Americans. You non working Trumper’s will have to mooch off someone else.
Longs should run for there life’s
"MySpace From 2005 to 2008, was the largest social networking site in the world, reaching more than 100 million users per month.and in June 2006 surpassed Yahoo! and Google to become the most visited website in the United States."
Don’t believe the slight bump. Being propped up. Won’t be here next year. Twitter is finito
I thought Parler was back on line.
"who ever has money, buy in now, hold the line $72"
Jack Dorsey's full scale censorship plan for any opinion he and his brownshirts do not like:https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/01/breaking-project-veritas-twitter-insider-records-ceo-jack-dorsey-laying-roadmap-future-political-censorship/
"Up again? Sorry, I bought cover already"
Good earnings
Why would anyone buy the stock of a company that is run by someone trying to take American rights away ?
Bye jack
This stock should be in the 20s and lawsuits should be filed ASAP
FB just hit the 6-month low mark!
FCC going to take control. Like they were suppose to 20 years ago.
"Across the board, the financial establishment has reacted with outrage to the surge in what previously were considered dead stocks. Industry insiders have taken to TV to decry the amateur investors, hedge fund billionaires have demanded the government intervene on their behalf, and investment firms have bailed out their short-selling colleagues who lost tens of billions of dollars when the stocks rose, instead of falling as they predicted."
SELL! Rumor is this will tank very soon! Not a joke!
"Twtr has over 75,000,000 enemies for life who will at any opportunity will do what they can to bring them DOWN."
"Sell twitter, fb, apple, googleBuy EV stocks NIO and Tessla"
Here’s another kicker. Twitter users are banning companies that advertise on Twitter. Soooo bad for business. Huge ouch!
Green!!
"Dumped Twitter! I have now Telegram and very happy, like other 500 milion active users."
Twitter stock is a terrible investment.
Stop the steal
you think Dorsey cares about the share holders?
Time to buy useful stocks like Tesla and Pharmaceutical.A Big dump is coming for Twitter and Facebook.
Do you think Twitter can survive as long as the rioting going on in Portland?
"Last night there was a priated video of Dorsey addressing his employees. Key take aways from his majesty:-Twitter will continue to censor right wing tweets-He has the moral authority to ""protect"" the american public.Can anyone remember what Josef Stalin said about opposing views in Pravda?"
Twitter is recklessly putting their political agenda before their shareholders.
"Social media was a fun pastime, until shadowbanning and now outright banning of people. The annoyance of having your account suspended because you hurt some snowflakes feeling by using real words... like there are only 2 sexes, should have been sufficient warning that political correctness was becoming more important than reality."
Bidding it up so the 25% routing its about to get doesnt seem as bad.
"Remember they push it higher on low volume so they can unload their positions at a good price. This will keep falling to reflect a price around 13 dollars. Write the following numbers down as you continue to short for a profit : Average Price: 47.8788 (50-day) 39.54 (200-day)Average Volume: 13,820,501 (50-day) 19,138,036 (200-day)"
"Was a Financial Principal of a NASD firm. Do not be surprised that the assumption TWTR will collapse Monday doesn't happen to the degree it should. The bad news is money will be pouring in to support the price of the stock. The good news is the SEC has the buyer information that can be traced back to the monies who purchased the stock. Also, the NASDQ should collapse based on their many abuses of our freedoms. Again don't be surprised if it initially doesn't happen."
Well congratulations to Cuckoo Dorsey and Crazy Joe they successfully wrecked the market in 8 days of teamwork.
What is the point of Twitter if all it's good for is censoring people
Jack n mark trying to please comrade Xi by censoring american so that they can get in China. $FB $TWTR
look at those numbers wait until next earnings this is a $20 stock. How does Adam shift still have a Twitter with all his misinformartion?
Liberals money
Dorsey on the Veritas recording with the face of the Marxist saying it's time to take the opposition down....and guess what? The vote is with him as the stock opened up. Guess there are more people who hate the Constitution and We the People than I thought.
2 more hour until market futures print.. How far down will they be?
"I sure enjoy watching this conitinue to drop, we would like to see it drop faster, millions of us. One thing is for sure, the actions to censor the American Patriots IS going to lead to competition. As soon as #45GOAT announces his suppprt for a platform, thats when this #$%$ crashes."
Chart Update: Of Course TWTR Is Very Overbought! Plus Market Is Headed Down!
Jack in the near future.
WE WOKE... TWITTER GO BROKE!!!!!!!WHO'S NEXT $FB $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL

"So it's wasn't the RUSSIANS RUSSIANS RUSSIANS after all, it was the CHINESE CHINESE CHINESE and China Joe and his pdo son were all for it."
"I agree, countries should ban Twitter, In the US as it is a monopoly it should be regulated."
Gain or loose money I’m shorting Twitter on principle

"Everybody should SHORT Twitter, FB, Amazon, and Apple... They'll be going down big times!"
"TWTR-SEC violation= When will TWTR make the timely disclosure of a MATERIAL DROP IN subscribers?Note Trial lawyers! Will you sue a ""Democrat"" company???/hmmmmmm"
Does Mike Pence have a twitter account? Face Book account? Instagram? Has he posted anything since Jan 6th?
anybody going to short this today?
I deleted 45 fake accounts and my one real account.. I also deleted the apps from all my mobile devices..
"Let me think, I could buy shares in this company which has NO products, makes NO money, and what little they made they handed it away to BLM, or FOR ABOUT THE SAME MONEY, I could buy shares in a real company LISTED on the Dow 30 like Cisco, Walgreens, Coca Cola, Verizon etc..."
"Twitter compare to FB is one trick pony, their business will be hurt much more. Users of Twitter are more politically active. Conservative part will be heard, maybe not by voices, but by loosing revenue."
10 a share come summer.
It’s not over till it’s over - “ we’ve just begun “Tuesday another 1-3% down 12 months of decline sounds great  Deactivate accounts - all biz and personal Sell and short this anti American company
"Glad I didn't take profits given TWTR saying rev double to $75Bby 2023..if so, stock is CHEAP"
Made a little $ shorting from just over $50 down to $44ish a few weeks back. Reopening a short just over $55 now. GL to all.
Now we don't have Democracy but DemoCRAZY....Haaaaa!
"By the time Dorsey is finished getting rid of all Twitter's customers - uh I mean human inventory - that don't fit in with his little Silicon Valley echo chamber, their stock price won't even buy you a latte at Starbucks."
this company needs to tank big time....let's go
Leave your politics at home Twitter. Censorship is not good.
No free speech for you Mr. John Q. American! So says Xi Jingping and his right hand man Jack. Sell.
"Twitter basher should just go & do something productive to better their own self,,, Twitter to a $100s level anytime soon. Hi Brenda!"
"And the Emmy for ""Lyin' Dog Faced Pony Soldier"" goes to.......... Mario ""Everyone Dies, So What?"" Cuomo!!!!!!!!!!!!"
A lots people is selling share soon..will see happening
I canceled Twitter. Too risky to continue. Haters will manipulate this stock. Not worth it! Bye bye
The tech giants would rather see tens of thousands of innocent people die than allow this information out to the public. We have never seen anything like this.On Saturday we heard word that Tom Fitton is still suspended off of Twitter — 14 days later. Tom is a leading voice for truth in this nation.
A buy at about $30.
"The government owns the internet and these big exploiting it to suppress the constitutional rights of people...Time to shut down big tech, they are funded by taxpayers...time for them to pay us back with their multibillion dollar profit.. ++++++++1"
Twitter claiming Texas AG Pattons lawsuits are bogus and that the AG’s suit should be thrown out because they are protected under the first amendment. What a laugh. If they are we are. Take this company down immediately. I hate fascists.
"Was Janet Yellen involved in the halting of trading in order to protect Citadel, a hedge fund that previously paid her nearly $1 million in speaking fees?"
"From THE $TWTR. Does that mean a loss or am I missing something???""For Q1'21, we expect:Total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.04 billionGAAP operating income to be between a loss of $50 million and break even"""
Sell your Twitter stock in protest of a communist company
"If this stock survives at all, it's because AAPL and AMZN propped it up with massive amounts of share purchasing."
Nothing satisfies me more than the falling price of TWTR.
"I?ve never shorted a stock before but seriously thinking of shorting this #$%$ Monday, guaranteed winner. This stock deserves the beating it?s about to get.Let?s change the term ?social media? to what it really is ?socialist media?"
Wall Street and TWTR is celebrating because 1 million people have lost their jobs. Good for China .
"Truth is a scary thing, when you’re on the wrong side of it."
Anybody has an idea technically how deep this could fall? $220-$230 short term possible? Looks like downwards pressure is building for $FB en $TWTR Tia
Funny people dont understand TWITTER IS OVER .... whoever buys now is toasted
I sold my shares and thank you Jack for been a hero make me losing $$$
India is banning Twitter from being used in their country. India is #3 in the world for Twitter users. India is taking a stand against corporations that are silencing free speech.
No upward movement. Could the 20 million accounts have switched over to Parler?
just so you guys know twitter had two previous quarters WITH profit. snap is losing money. snap touts they have more daily users. guess what? twitter revenue is higher than snap revenue every quarter. if snap is so great how come they have less revenue while having more daily users??? aside from that twitter is profitable. snap is not. and on top of all this snap market cap is nearly twice that of twitter all while having less revenue than twitter and not being profitable as twitter is? how does this make sense?!
Don’t forget the 10% for the big guy.
There's one huge bubble waiting to pop & Twitter may be what ignites everything. Lets see if SEC has anything to say about biased treatment of customers and total disregard for shareholders
I deactivated my account
"Everyone realizes we are no different that people fighting for kings and their lands 500 years ago. When it is all over the masses get nothing.The kings get the land and riches and we slay each other for nothing.Right or Left, Censorship is not going to help this country.Clearly there are people of common sense on both sides, yet we let the 10% of extremists on the left and the 10% extremists on the right, fire us up.When that stops our country will be what it should be. Turn off the media, that will help."
"Twitter, Facebook, Google Apple have been colluding for a while with each other and refer to each other multiple times as ""PEERS"". They are not peers they are competitors. Any action together as peers violate Anti Trust laws but more importantly have recently lead them to act on their own feelings instead of what is in the best interest of their shareholders. I really think those hurt by Jack Dorsey's incompetence should start a class action and sue Twitter."
where is the bottom?
Wow so it’s true. I made a sensible comment that yahoo didn’t like and it deleted it.
"hey you guys ready for Obama 2.0??? looks like all these cabinet members are Obama rejects showing up again.WOW, just think we already had 8 years of NOTHING, we will get 4 more????? Make America Poor Again.MAPA.. New slogan."
why is this stock going up?
Twitter opposes free speech. Delete your account. I have. Encourage others to do the same. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Sell your stock.
"Institunional investors will soon start runing away. How can any respectable firm put it's money into a company, that is so unpredictable. What if one day, after a long crack smoking session, Jack Dorsey will deside that Twitter will fund North Korea's nuclear program? How reliable is that?"
"Does yahoo, aol and twitter pay their anti first amendment censors $15.00 an hour and give them healthcare."
Love seeing the stock drop like a rock!! It seems to have alienated half of America who may deleted the app. Might be the first stock I ever shorted!! Seems like a perfect one to try it on
what goes better with conservative tears? hot dogs or hamburgers?
This Is One Strong Bird! Mid $50's On The Way! Tweet It Baby Tweet It;)
OHHH BOY...hedge funds starting to short now -- this is gonna get real fun!

"In a letter Piton sent to the Arizona legislature in December, he pointed out that more that 50% of a sample of 1,000 voters in the 2020 election were not real people. The sample came from a list of 100,000 voters in the 2020 election in Arizona."
There she blows. welcome to fake News on that upgrade.
I would like to thank all the Twitter bashers and haters. the more you post the higher the stock price goes. you bashers are making me a lot of money.
how is this not impeachable?
"Is Mitch now yet another “enemy or the people”? If I watch Super Bowl, but wear my “Elect Turnip” hat, am I good?"
"It's Wednesday, February 3, 2021. Who will Jack Goebbels Dorsey and his twatteratti brownshirts be censoring today??"
When do people think this will fall. Is this going to be a Tilray type of drop?
$60's 
Jack should mess up the earnings call tomorrow morning not only will it take down Twitter but it’s gonna take down square ￼
Delisted 2021!!!!

"Sell this stock, save freedom"
WOW look at all the twitter shares!
"Never went on Twitter and I'll probably be deleting my Facebook too. Be careful what you wish for Lefties, because it could be YOU who is censored one day. Society's new mantra is - shutup and take it and do what you are told. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press is dead.Is it not curious that all the big names are dropping Parler in lockstep? Eliminate your competition when you see blood in the water. There's no reason Parler should be shutdown.Whether you know it or not, you are being controlled in order to make rich people richer. Guess who's getting richer during the COVID pandemic? It ain't the average American. It's big corporations, 1%ers, and the D.C. power circle. Draconian restrictions and lockdowns has caused more harm around the world than the virus itself. China. Guess who else has ties with China? Your new President."
"Based on the Project Veritas video and Dorsey's arrogance toward the American people, I will be shorting his stocks (Twit and Square) until they are out of existence. You like cancel culture Jack? You will see how it works when money cancels you. I urge all stockholders to do the same. Let's show Jack who is really in charge."
"The same reason these tech companies have section 230 they used their power to shut down opposition and censor even the POTUS. Are you serious? We have a Constitution, and can't wait to see the results of all this. I promise todays valuations of these Big Tech will lose BIG. They have gotten too big for their own good."
"Triple digits handle coming for TWTR. It lagged Facebook for years because they couldn't find ways to make money on the app. Now they are projecting huge revenues so that hurdle is cleared. This will be a HUGE mover in 2021,"
Get ready to leave this platform...pay-off all your debt with TWTR short. Parler will win antitrust suit.
"Now the Dumbocrats are talking about giving families 300 dollars per month for each child. Where is all this money coming from? I did some math. If you stacked a trillion dollars if would go around the world approximately two and a half times. Oh let's pay off student debt. The educated people make the most money. You don't have to drive $50,000 cars. This is just the beginning. Their nuts."
downgrade coming? over valued? my opinion
Bets guess this week will see another 12% drop.

Sell this commie company and any other company that does not support the 1st amendment.
It all makes sense now.. Remember how confident Barack Hussein was when sending the message to Putin about how he'll have more flexibility after he wins the election.. The fix was in then and he knew it..

When it goes to 50 cent Jack will give an executive order to reverse split this stock. That will get the price back up so he can continue his reign.

"Amazon web services is not the only web service providers in the World. Other companies are selling web services so parler can goto Amazons competitors but parler can also build their own web servers and not rely on left wing run companies like Microsoft, Amazon etc. and therefore not need Amazon or Microsoft to flourish and then parler can ban liberal democrat companies from using its web services."
"Uh-oh, DOW Futures are down tonight; that would be 4 consecutive down days for the DOW, possibly indicating the start of the long anticipated Bear Market. If I was a Twitter bag-holder, I would be a little nervous about the near term prospects of Twitter's SP. Just saying."
dorsey havin a good time
I want to thank Jack for making all shorts rich......
I think Twitter has made a big mistake. My opinion!
Best short in the entire stock market. Sub $10 in 6 months.
"Will donate any money I made shorting this stock to any Trump fundraiser, especially for 2024 campaign, have been short since Monday...keep falling Twitter, thanks for the easy money! ha ha"

Looking forward to to watching this drop on Monday
It's Funny people don't believe Patriots have the Power. Jack should take a good hard look at what happened to the NFL MLB NBA the last few years
The deep state is full of shallow thinkers and they own TWTR. Sweet dreams.
im selling all my shares!! this stock is going tank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I sold all shares of TWTR because its speech control makes me feel that I'm living under a Communist country.

I love Twitter
Jake is going to have to start up Dominion to make numbers work on the ER
This is gonna crash. Can't wait. Revenues aren't keeping up with pace. Next earnings will open some eyes.
Sooner or later all TWTR users will be blocked or canceled!
"Twitter, Amazon, and Apple will probably work with Joey and Nancy on Article 2 now to target you gun owners. That will be chaos."
Hope it drops to ZERO!
This should be shorted into the ground!!
Twitters revenue depends on the advertisement and users.
Sell Twitter. The trend has begun
"Conservative patriots have started a snowball that will turn into a huge avalanche to crush the four-headed Big Tech monster (Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple) by sending a text message to their family and friends about alternative services (gab, directly from vendors or Walmart +, Me/We, DuckDuckGo). Please d your part."
"No more revenue sell and buy NIO now before you lose more money,"
censoring and deleting is also called tampering with evidence
Lenin would have made a great Ceo for Twitter
I guess shorts will be safe for the next couple of days.
Nelson Mandela would’ve been banned by Twitter. Am I wrong?

Both Martin Luther King and his son would’ve been banned by Twitter under their current CEO. Am I wrong?
The paradox for TWTR may be that there is a lack of short interest in the stock. Nobody wants to be caught in another GME debacle. The stock rises because it is mainly day traders. Pump and dump. The stock will drop dramatically when the equilibrium fails.

"I see no upside for this stock , for months or maybe years."
"I shorted again this morning. Gotta remember, a 10% move in one day is generally a good time to take profits. However, there are exception. The air is coming out of Dorsey's balloon with predictable certainty! Also, I am a long in SRNE and INSM. Biotech is risky, but has tremendous upside! The institutions buy up biotech low, and then the standoff is for how many retail will sell their shares before the price explodes higher. In Twitter's case, the institutions were loaded up, and they're in a standoff for who blinks first. Meanwhile, retail has been exited on their intuition that this will not end well!"
Only a Millenial Zero Net Worth Starbucks Barista in San Francisco trading on Robinhood is telling his Zero Net Worth Co Worker what a great buy TWTR is because its down from its high. Dummies dont know this terd is going to $10.
"I hope Twitter crashes, it will be at $20 by the end of the week :)"
Sold my rest of shares... I don’t see an upside anymore and the market will correct soon
"It would be no surprise to me if Queen Jackie will eventually follow the footsteps of her mentor, Queen Teem Cook, in the future."
Just sold my shares of Twitter and Facebook and cancelled my accounts too.
I wish I had a twitter account to delete but I have never had one.
Freedom of speech for all. America.. Not Twitter.
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but Twitter has lost about 5-10 billion in market cap in a week."
Never catch a falling knife !!!
"I just DownGraded Twitter to $6 dollar target based upon ""Bubble"" P/E and unAmerican polices. You know things are BAD when Angela Merkel says its wrong!"
"Get out of this stock today, down 20% in one month. Short this down to the pennies. Dorsey has No Regard for stock holders."
"Left, Right, Middle, Neither, everyone really would be fine if twitter collapses. here's hoping it does!"
"The number of protesters who peacefully assembled on the mall in Washington, D. C. on January 6th is estimated to be 200,000. The number of citizens who entered the Capital building that afternoon is estimated to be 200. That means that only 1/10 of 1% of the protesters morphed into insurrectionists. The Left will try to link conservative patriots with those right-wing anarchists in an attempt to demonize and silence us. We must resist this false caricature in every legal way possible."
100+ the they make in mandatory for there users to take the vaccccineee... AMD suspension for the members that refuse
When I look at TWTR I reflect on the dead sparrow I saw on the road today.
congratulations longs ) 66 as expected yesterday
Buying this stock now would be like buying into a Ponzi scheme. How can a company with a Market cap of $36 billion dollars and annual revenue of only $4 billion with very marginal profits be worth anywhere near $45 dollars per share. It is utter insanity.
Trump is the best President in History
Please daddy...tell us the story when you were able to say and think as you wanted....ahhhh yes kids....that was a glorious time...it ended right after heels up harris voted to destroy the 2nd amendment.
Only up a sliver on a Green Day with an upgrade...

I'm 100% sure that next week's TWTR will be $ 38
"TWTR, AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB are responsible for the whole situation, the division of people in the US."
"Today is Friday, January 15, 2021 and Twitter with Facebook are garbage companies that spy on you, censor news, and sell your personal information to whomever would buy it."
"Communist China media like TWTR, GOOG, AAPL, FB thinks nothing happened."
"""Watch me pull a presser out of my hat!"" So many hopes, so many dreams. Been public for 8 years ... but now this epiphany/miracle!BUY, BUY, BUY!!! Sure thing. To $500/share. BUY!"
I hope this stock goes to the pink sheets! Gfy!
"Less users going forward, negative earnings and your newly voted taxes coming.....enjoy Twits."

"Unofficial reports suggest 20,000-50,000 users an hour are cancelling their user accounts."
I quit Twitter permanently after being on from the beginning. Parler is where I have gone.
Russias knows the huge popularity of Twitee...... Twetee destiny is to reach the maximum high speed elevation going to $ !00 plus
Dorsey is the king!!!!
Faang stocks taking a beating and is going to get worse. Twitter is going to the basement.
"It's Tuesday, January 12. Who are Jack Dorsey and his Twatteratti censoring today? Oh, look, QAnon is the newest recipient of the brownshirt treatment."
I closed my Twitter account this year. Refuse the #$%$ censorship.
"Ronald Reagan, in one of his more famous speech (and one of his most accurate I might add) stated, AMD I quote. ""If facism ever comes to America it will come in the name of Liberalism"". Now we have them. Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Cook and Bezos, plus folks like AOC, Schiff, Pelosi and Schumer. Boycott their companies and the businesses that advertise on them."
The purest form of science is math. The statistical evidence points to shanghai joe as havin acheived victory purely by nefarious means. Anyone who believes a legitimate win is a science denier.
Forty Two
Closed with a head and shoulders on the 30 yesterday and looks like we may get on on the PM chart. if so we could see 43 today shorts definitely 45
#WheresHunter
Testing the 2nd Support point. Nice nice nice... Going under 44 in an hour.
"I don't really support shorting stocks in general. However, shorting Twitter is a win for democracy!"
Somehow 45 is even playing more golf now than he did in office. I would have thunk that was impossible.
James seems a bit angry today. Not sleeping well little man! LOL
Twitter=1984!!!
Joe signed another EO to sell our power grids to China. Why does Joe hates Americans so much?
When thousands of people stormed the Capitol in Madison 10 years ago to stop the vote on collective bargaining Nancy praised them. Miss two face..

"wow sleepy Joe crying during the meeting today. He knows he can't do anything and lipstick AOC is running the show. He is also crying he has no idea to do with 8,000 people about to storm border."
The only reason this price gets pumped because tons of shares need to be dumped.
"Glad I shorted yesterday! Let's keep it going.........down, down, down! LOL Wait until the market starts going down then watch how fast and hard Twitter falls, and it's coming, it's definitely coming!"
I can't believe anyone would short this stock
"There are a lot of individual investors buying long. ""Put"" options are cheap for the 4/16 date. Could be easy money. Who knows?"
"I sold my shares and deleted my twitter account. I strongly oppose what the company is doing.However, the stock has significant upside based on valuation to peers and an incoming, friendly administration. Obama stated recently that big tech and government should work closely together. Philosophically, this is a disaster in my mind because I think we are an exceptional country based on our founding principles. If the new administration allows twitter and others to work around our rights when convenient, it will energize almost half the country. I believe TWTR could move to $100+ this year. Count me out regardless. I want no part of what is coming."
Market is up 600+ points
Down 10% today. TENS of millions will cancel this week. Plus million will be selling their shares. What Twitter did was wrong. Enjoy the ride DOWN.
5 billion dollar lawsuit coming from the trump administration
"I did sell short heavily yesterday and made 10% , I will do it again when the time is right . I want to see TWTR disappear"
TWTR up again tomorrow. You can see it coming!
"SELL,,,, SHORT,,, SHORT,,, SHORT,, it's all about free speech...... let's show them free speech..."
in the impeachment the liberals just got messed up! 1st amendment will prevail!
George Soro is the only one trying to prop this up and he'll lose

Twitter now exposed! China had been exposed.
Bad news coming on Twitter. Heard it here first
"$20 back in March, and that was already too much. This bubble is about to seriously go pop."
"The Capitol Police has more than 2000 officers and an annual budget of $500 million, all to patrol 2 square miles of land. We don't need permanent fencing around the seat of US democracy. We need them to do their job.The EOs coming out of Washington are not what Americans want."
You can bet Dorsey and his mates are offloading their shares right now. Which he got for free incidentally.
held this for 6 years what a horrible investment I think just once it beat earning and gave a good forcast but the future looks very dim
True story! I was a union contractor in Chicago . I laid off over 150 democratic liberals and moved my head quarters to Florida. None union !They got pink slips January 1st !The moral of this story is liberals and unions destroy America

"Makes sense. Market up 2%, and TWTR decides not to participate. I've gotten used to this. I hate twitter....but, will probably never sell any more than I have already unloaded."
judging by the comments we all can tell who has more support and votes. until we are blocked
I deactivated my twitter account today.
"No freedom of speech, no peace"
Congratulation To Everyone Who Got In On The Drop To $56 After Earnings Announcement! I Have To Say I Am Very Proud of Our Beautiful Bird! I Am Very Disappointed In The Shorts! You Usually Let Me Get Some Really Cheap Shares! Patterns Work Until They Don't LOL!!
Why would anyone in his right mind own this stock??? #sellstock
"Why does the media facilitate Don Lemon trying to associate conservatives with any nasty hate group he can think of, including the clan and national socialists (such comparison being made on the basis of identity politics and not on true actions or beliefs--just whether he can produce an example of a bad person who happens to vote one way or the other and branding everyone that way)? It is a fact that no Republicans owned any slaves a year before the civil war, that the Republican party was formed to eliminate slavery, that the Republican party introduced civil rights legislation, and that the Democratic party (actions, not mere identity) supported slavery, jim crow, etc., well into the 1960s or so. In fact, why tear down statutes of dead people when you have the actual organization that did all that, alive and well today? Reparations? Go talk to the Democratic party."
My first time shorting and made 10k. Love this
I don’t own Twitter anymore. I’m here because I’m getting some kind of fantastic satisfaction seeing the downfall after the pent up frustrations of having the conservative voice suppressed. They all are getting what they deserve and I’m relieved.
OSCAR data heating up. You know what that is right? Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio. And they’re waiting for aAnd they’re waiting for aAnd they’re waiting for aMiracle.

"Buyout or Takeover of Twitter seems inveitable. From Google or some other ""news"" Network. Jack Dorsey is not going to run both Twitter and Square for ever. Twitter will be bought by someone...big."
Why are people paying $77 for a $40 stock?!? Lol.
We should learn from our past. The country cannot thrive or survive so divided. Very sad and both sides should be worried for the country.
In honor of POTUS 45 Take this down to 45....
Literally had just posted a comment about media controlling the message with Kamala Harris’ comments about allowing and encouraging riots to continue and how Twitter and Big Tech is doing the same to us. It was gaining traction and had 13-1 positive votes in less than 5 min and guess what? POOF!! It’s gone. Yahoo is part of the censorship problem. What a joke.
Retail shorts can cover tonight. BIG SHORTS will cover tomorrow. New 52 week high will print tomorrow. It will be fast and furious.
"Who will start the class action lawsuit against Jack & Twtr for putting political preference before company value? Looks like his decision has cost share holders about 10 Billion of value in 1 week, with worse to come. Worst part is that now antitrust lawsuits and section 230 immunity will be going away, opening the door to thousands of law suits. I think I am out!"
Sell this censorship loving company
What possible headline could turn this thing around?

Wow a lot of 'S' is going down now. Be careful over the weekend as our Country will be fighting back. Be alert and stay loyal to the Country.

Divide and conquer the dems motto Freedom of speech is a right and should not be controlled by the left.Twitter has decided to divide and fuel the fire it will not end good for Twitter or it’s stock holders. Very bad decision on Twitters part.

I saw these and thought Yeah that’s our GRUJimmy and his tweet machine down there with putey making Texans life even more difficult.
The Twitter supporters here realize that through this shareholders lawsuit settlement Dorsey had to give up all rights of control over the company right? Worst company of 2021 easily.
Gravity is a funny thing.
"Congrats to $TWTR management on the 'Hope and Change' targets! Well played pump.Of course they have been a publically traded company since Nov, 2013 (8 years) with a business model that has not brought them fame, fortune or riches.

Excuse me. What's Twitter?
5 dollar stock by the end of summer
Twitter offends half of the USA and their stock price goes up. This making money off stocks is a very confusing proposition.
Btw. Sold. Made $26k. Thanks.No donation to Big-o-Lardo. Not a “Patriot’
Wait for the morning lull in about an hour. It will show no mercy as this stock plummets and NEVER recovers. Half the users are gone now. The advertisers will also walk away. Twitter has no business model.
"I don't know who would want to own this stock at these prices. Politics and free speech issues aside, they've made a bad business decision that they can't take back. It took them years to add those millions of users and lost them practically overnight."

TWTR was trading below $18/share when Trump won the Presidency in Nov 2016. Trump's usage of Twitter over his 4 years dramatically increased revenues and the stock price. Removing Trump will cost Twitter many followers and revenues. The stock price will parallel those reductions. Biden is just not that interesting and entertaining.
im measuring my whiteness.....1 thru 10....10
There also maybe a market for Jack to sell whats left of TWTR to IRAN! Since he like that leader!
You know what else isn't going to be forgiven? Your rent. In fact I jut raised it. Welcome back to the plantation wagie. No more avocados for you
I am surprised that anyone is going long at these prices because there is much more volume in PUT options vs. CALL options for TWTR.
"One thing the board is forgetting and this may get deleted again! Once Trump takes out Biden in the final round (next week), you can be sure section 230 will be destroyed and his executive order from 2018 will delist this #$%$ from the Nasdaq. Outside of everything else, this will be worth $0."
"No Parler. No problem let’s use twtr, google Ann and apple conversation board on yahoo finance.. lmao yahoo is another biased outlet"

This is speculation on speculation. Twitter lost 1.15 Billion last year. All of the interesting personalities and topics are censored.
"My sister thinks that socialism is great, and says everyone should be equal. Then she goes out and purchases a new Lexus! My parents tell her that she won't be able to purchase new cars like a Lexus if marxism being spewed by MSNBC, CNN, Huffington Post, NYT, Yahoo, Google, AOC, Bernie, Nancy, Schumer, and other leftists prevail. She told them that they don't know what they're talking about and have been watching too much Fox news. She proceeded to say all it takes is for the top 1% to pay their fair share and for corporations to give all of their earnings to their employees and the government. Unbelievable! MSNBC is all her and her husband watch 24/7."
"Once again, Twitter is leading the communications field. Twitter is now monitoring all tweets and will “fact check” everything and make appropriate comments. I think the telephone companies need to follow this excellent example. They simply monitor your telephone conversation and then interrupt your call with appropriate “fact checking”."
"I realy like clubhouse ftom Elon Musk, much more better then twitter"
"Obviously retailers will be selling on Monday. Question is will institutions do so as well? If they do and large hedge players short it, then it could be dooms day for Twitter."
Big Twatter day coming..
"William Gates doesn’t get a pass. Flying around with his billionaire toys doesn’t make him exempt from the climate crisis. Gates claims he’s a good billionaire, who wants to offset his climate damage. He does it by making more money investing in companies that promise to remove his carbon. This cyclical BS doesn’t work. Gates can drive or walk, has money enough to be Virtual anywhere, and with a pandemic raging, doesn’t NEED to be anywhere. Take a break, Gates, and stop messing it up for the rest of us."
"Twitter reached user saturation nearly 10 years ago. It's simply not a very useful platform for anyone beyond socialites, celebrities, and politicians. Did you ever notice how most of the tweets that the average person hears about are typically embedded in more mainstream news sources? Smoke and mirrors have been the only thing that's been keeping the numbers looking good. IMO it's useless technology that's been struggling for a reason to exist for years."
"From Florida's Great Govenor The act, should it pass muster in the state House and Senate, would force tech platforms to disclose what data they have on Floridians to those users and delete that information if requested. Earlier this month, DeSantis unveiled a proposal cracking down on social media companies themselves. This legislation is the sequel.The first round of legislation would enact a $100,000 daily fine for any platform found to be de-platforming political figures and candidates for office."
Can’t stand by a company that doesn’t value our right to free speech. Deleted and sell
"Hundreds of rep investors will dump Twitter stock at the opening, this is a coordinated action. I advice everyone to setup stop loss orders."
We are short selling this today and laughing all the way to the bank!
Twitter finally free!!!!
"Why are my posts being deleted? Something very, very evil is going on."
Twitter is going to $100 because Jim Cramer is the biggest pumper and has a $100 target price! Buy now!!
I shorted TWTR because I saw this happening. Took a nice profit this morning. Going to donate it to the NRA and Parler.
I wonder when the panic selling starts
Can't wait for the law suits. You get what you deserve. Enter the abyss where you belong. ACLU even says you are wrong!
Deleted FB account
Put country ahead of censorship sell your Twitter now!!!!
"Tyson knows what to do with a dead bird. If they can't sell it retail, they make cat food out of it."
Finally stopped?
Twitter above 60 after earning and its still cheap
The swamp is still draining.
I hope the stock tanks!
Those holding on still believe this was a fair E L E C T I O N
OK now going to test 45... sticking with 25 by summer
This what the market thinks of the Retrumplicans thinking they could sink Twtr pps....
"More room to fly.....flying higher to $100 plus level,,, no stopping"
"Retrumplicans really brought this down.....lol. BTW, bought in at $44.05. Thanks for the great entry!! Jack Dorsey for, ""Man of the year""!"
CANCEL TWITTER ACCOUNT NOW - Do Not Support Communism!
Illusion if you think this is going to stay up. Democrats and Republicans and conservatives will be running from Twitter. This is just the beginning.
Head and Shoulders still forming nicely on the 1 yr. buy your puts out past Feb 9th. losing half its user base worldwide will be detrimental.
At twitter headquarters
"Ironic how it's stuck at the ""45"" level...Coincidence? I think not."
At what percentage of a loss will institutions start dumping ?Right now we are at 20% .Keep up the good work vanguard is starting to worry
That’s a nice double top on the 6m & 1m chart￼. But I’m sure that doesn’t mean anything LOL￼.
"There is no protection for children on Twitter. I had to ban my 13 year old son from using Twitter, after he began to get naked pictures of men sent as dm's. It said clearly on his account that he was 13 and wanted to chat with other kids who played Playstation games. Twitter is a playground for pedo's."
"If you are not out of Twitter yet, GET OUT ASAP! Twitter is going down!!!"
It will be fun watching big tech lose in the stock market tomorrow.
"In other news, it was reported today that Rudy Giuliani has now joined the ranks of the ""Public Transit Vehicle Undercarriage Inspectors"" union as a labor representative for the PTVUIU. He has also landed a gig as the hair-model for a major shoe-polish manufacturer. Bigly. Believe me. MAGA - Mulvaney and Giuliani AWOL"
"Since Dorsey was under oath at the time, it is now confirmed that he committed perjury, which is a serious crime. Will he ever be held accountable?"
American Patriots support the right of free enterprises in the free market to enforce their terms of service. USA #1.
Never catch a falling knife.
I am thinking a good strategy may be to wait until this sock gets to $100 as the prophet Cramer said it would and then short it. What do y'all think?
Another Monday and another short to put in. I think overall market is going to have a bad week and twitter is poised to lead the way down.
"Like always, when the qrtly report was good, the market will turn red! When is this thread going to stop for twtr! "
MAGA impeached TWTR and the market has now convicted TWTR. Shorts will now feed off the carcass. Sad some longs were just caught in the middle.
That was short lived. Down she goes...
Fund managers at vanguard and others are having meetings on how far they will let Twitter go backwards before they bail ! Most were in before 20.00 When this happens look out
Newly published SEC filings showing Insider selling has started...Jumping ship!
"Pre-order Twtr feb 8 earning reports to 62 to 65.. Twtr hit 57 after hrs,now"
"So Jack, can you explain to me why my 13 year old son gets DM's on Twitter from middle-aged men asking him to do things, and from others showing naked pictures of women? It says clearly on his account that he is a young teenager and only interested in gaming."
Twitter is the best social medi- app. Twitter made me rich. I invested in Twitter after I saw Jack Dorsey on TV. He inspired me and converted me from conservative to liberal. His ideology is above wisdom. Now I’m in full support of censorship and cancel culture. Lets defend democracy and put decency back in the White House by crushing the deplorable right. Orange man is bad.
if you wanna see what's in store for Twitter look at MOMO 1 year chart. that's if your lucky.
Me making fun of 45 Fanboys: “Uh...let’s short Twitter” 
"Jackoff on video: ""we gonna purge millions of accounts from twitter""bulls: ""buy the dip"""
"NEGATIVE SUBSCRIBER Growth, TANKING Revenues, Terrible ER, Terrible Guidance, but $TWTR BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!"
"It's one thing to block far-right fanatics and extremists. However, blocking an entire political party is unacceptable. This was way over the line. I enjoyed having political discussions/debates with my Conservative and liberal counterparts. I will be deleting my Twitter and FB due to this as well..."
Nice Close  Who's buying this Turd tomorrow?
Hope you trumpers are sending him donations.... because I hear he's thinking of filing for bankruptcy for the 7th time
How is this reckless company not in the 30s yet?
Jack Dorsey bears a striking resemblance to Grigori Rasputin wouldn't you say?
The collapse will soon intensify. Twitter will be $15 in a year.
The Republican Party is eating itself alive! Meanwhile Twitter sets new highs almost daily!
Too much Risk here. Reward favoring the Short side
Cancel Twitter and follow the same people on Parler. It’s back.
"I sold my stock in twitter today, about 25,000 was doing well with it, but so not happy with their censorship!!!!"
"Does anyone know how to join the coming class action lawsuits against TWTR? Every lawyer in America must be frothing at the mouth ready to file class actions and anti trust lawsuits against APPL, TWTR, AMXN, and GOOG right now. The Board of Directors need to step in and take action on behalf of the shareholders being bent over becasue of management's actions. AMZN has clearly demonstrated they are a monopoly or belong to a group of monopolies in the cloud & infrastructure hosting arena. Not to mention, they are definitely in breach of contract with Parler. There is no way IN HELL AMZN will be able to justify breaking their Parler contract without allowing Parler to first offload to another provider. Can you imagine the lawsuit coming AMXN's way on this? And for what? Just to pound their liberal drum a little louder?"
"twitter just permanently deleted 1 very powerful account, then 12 million twitters followed suit by deleting 12 millions twitter accountsouch ! fair trade to me...."
"Take your money (whats left) and buy real hard assets. Banks, Oil. Protect yourself from tech asset bubble."
This is known as biting the hand that feeds you...10 a share by summer
Next stop $70
who sold at 44.50 because of the trump ban?
short squeeze?
Best guess is that 20-40 million accounts will be canceled this week by the users. Shares are also being sold. No knows just how low the price will drop over the next 90 days.
Twitter is going the way of MySpace.
"It beat earnings (by a marginal amount), growth seems verry halted if you look at the numbers."
We need to compile a list of companies advertising on Twitter and boycott them. The use of our dollars is one of the strongest weapon we have in the struggle against the Left. Please post info about Twitter's advertisers if you have it. Thank you.
The sad thing is there is more free speech on these message boards than Twitter.
Sell today! This will drop fast! Not a joke
Project Veritas has recordings of the CEO of Twitter discussing the censorship of the Titan .. they say that there are multiple people within Twitter who have volunteered to denounce their boss !!
"The thing is, Twitter and Facebook are selling your PERSONAL INFORMATION to anyone who will give them money. Aren't you afraid? I know I am. That's where the data leaks begin, that's where the fraud begins, that's where someone steals your id. Just who has your information now? You don't know. No one does. Twitter and Facebook sold you."
"The left has hit the airways talking about ""hate speech"" and how they want to ban it.. Well I hate to break it to them, but ""Hate Speech"" is 100% constitutional."

How can I recover Monday morning. I don’t think my asking price will hold as this drops. Any helpful suggestions are appreciated.

This company is toast. Save yourself
"I wouldn't purchase a share of twtr for 20.00 a share, But that's just me. Free speech is a right according to the left wing as long as it isn't a Conservative making the speech. GLTA"

People remembering the last time they made money in Twitter!!!!!
Senator Ted Cruz challenged the results in Arizona which was his duty.
Look like people will move to Reddit..this stock will be down when ER coming.. Good luck..My predict around $35.00 or lower..Short will win.
notice how Brenda just talked about how cathy woods is shorting the stocks that she is telling you to buy? She knows because that is exactly what she does. when she tell you to buy she shorts..... when she tells you overbought and sell she is buying....
Put options are going to absolutely explode tomorrow morning after the Project Veritas video appears and knocks Jackoff into the abyss
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS...THE PARTY'S OVER......ALL GOOD THINGS MUST END........ADIOS BWAAAAAAH!!!
Where's Ronjon? Still buying a sinking ship?? LMAO!
TWTR HAS BECOME THE THE POSTER CHILD OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DICTATOR CONTROL OF THE WEB. MOST DICTATORS HISTORY TELLS US FALL AND FAIL! $25 BT EOD EASY
"I cancelled my $TWTR, $FB and $AMZN accounts."
Will Twitter block the thousands of leftists planning to show up at state capitals to fight?
Hope Twitter and Facebook go out of business. I have use Twitter in 5 years and I have cancelled my Facebook account. They will never influence me again
Nice to see the TWTR board evolving into a communication method for patriots. Please share this and let's send TWTR reeling to the single digits (where this turd belongs). Short at will. Eff ewe Jack.
Keep up the good work Shorts 
This is a easy short! No brainer 38.00 easy
I just canceled my Twitter account. Feels good
"Come on, we all know you're heading back to the red zone, stop playing"
yum....i love being white.....yes sir
"How are things working out in Democratic controlled California? Can't go to a restaurant & even eat 6' apart ""outdoors"" Forget working out at a gym... Need a haircut, go under ground to find a place, etc. TWTR & $FB & the DEMS want us to conform or else..."
Good news now is that you don't need to repeal Section 230 as Twtr just imploded.
Call your brokers first thing tomorrow morning to sell these toxic companies in your 401K and retirement portfolios!!
FB and TWTR are being banned from Internet Provider..... hahaha
"74,000,000 Americans and many more are disgusted by Twitter's outrageous attempt to to censor the Conservative voice in America. Twitter will pay for it. The FCC will be on their back and watch Twitter shares plummet."

Any idea if Rudy Giuliani is going to sue Deutsche Bank for cutting Trump off from loans and the PGA for cancelling their golf tournaments at his courses?
"TWTR stayed alive because D.T used it, now looks like a dying dinosaur"
This company is responsible for all the chaos and division of people in the US. Don't forget this .
George Orwell was right
"I wish Twitter would go broke. I can't stand Jack Dorsey! democrats seem to love the word ""collusion"" but see no issues with Twitter, Facebook, Google and Amazon colluding to take down anyone they want for any reason which always includes ""taking out competition"". But the democrats see no issue with that. I don't think any of those four companies would have the balls to do it to Joe Biden or any democratic affiliation. The democrats will always protect those four. ALWAYS!"
"Wow my last post is not here. It must have been censored, only thing I can think of is I mentioned the T man in it. This is getting pretty crazy."
imagine elon musk stepped in to create a new twitter
I thought for sure CPAC would have Jake Chansley and Bigo Barnett speaking at the convention.
"“This isn't Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It's the United States Congress,"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said in May as he railed against several Democrats who attended a launch after signing a letter saying their absence was due to the public-health crisis.The list of Republicans who wrote letters appointing a proxy include speakers at CPAC on Friday, such as Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.; Greg Steube, R-Fla.; Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C.; and Ted Budd, R-N.C. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., who is speaking Saturday at the conference, signed onto a lawsuit against proxy voting."
Being almost dead from poison is not an excuse to miss parole. 3 years.. Be glad you live here even though the left is trying to silence the right.
Sell sell sell! Use your data and info for profiting! Where is your privacy?? Playing politics?? Save America without Twitter and Facebook!! 
Gab and Telegram traffic continues to explode higher. They are taking a big bite out of someone. I wonder who that could be.
45 barely got 2% GDP growth with massive tax cuts and significant increases in government spending in support of 45's socialism.
Twitter is done for. I’m out.
Looks like it's losing the will to fight... we might see a big red candle before today is done.
This will be the mother of all short plays come Monday morning.
twitter Made In china
Nothing will be lost when twitter fails itself. Everyone will gain a new understanding.
This stock is my favorite short period price target zero
"Jake Chansley aka the Qanon Shaman and Bigo Barnett are rumored to be guest speakers at Trumps send off tomorrow. Don't miss it ""live"" on Fox News tomorrow."
I thought goldman put 112 price target?? Going wrong way!!
Is this the Twitter board?
"Kamala Harris should be impeached after she takes office for helping violent rioters, looters, and arsonists in Minneapolis post bail so that could potentially commit additional acts of violent destruction. On June 1, 2020 Senator Harris tweeted: ""If you're able, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesters on the ground in Minnesota. We must use the same political weapons that is being used by the Left. Immediately, contact your House Representative to get the impeachment ball rolling. Just don't post on a messaging board, but take action TODAY."
sold my puts yesterday for a mild gain. Good timing on my part. This is to manipulated for my liking.
Problem is Twitter....I haven't heard a single left-wing person or group complain about being censored on your app.
"Out of 718 businesses in downtown Portland, only 430 are (sorta) still open--most by appointment. 200 nights of riots in Portland. People beat and shot. Same with Seattle. California, police shot while just patrolling. Where where all these companies like Twitter and Facebook during all of this? In fact, they let calls for violence against Pence to trend after they kicked off a bunch of people."
"I Have Been One If Not The Biggest Bull On TWTR For 4 Years! But, Our Beautiful Bird Has Lots Of Gaps Guys! And You All Know How I Feel About Gaps! Fill Those Gaps Baby;)"
Another good day in the National Socialist Twitter Workers' Party.
Our Beautiful Bird Is Very Over Bought! But Refuses To Go Down;) And For Everyone Who Needs To Know I Do Not Short Shock!
Twitter started the run too late and chose the wrong time. Hence the shareholder lawsuit to silence him. The purchase of the recent company was a reach to a peg of a drowning company and they overpaid extremely because it was from desperation.
Every time I make a comment on this board it gets deleted. Google Mark Levin and listen to his comments on the Capitol riot.
US and Russia are battling for European gas business. Thanks Joe I think you picked the winner.
I can't believe this is happening in America. I dumped Twitter and Facebook this morning.
The fight is between good and (evil-Twitter).
Is it communism to ban the person inciting violence against our own capital???
bye bye twtr
Too woke - gone broke
BYE BYE TWITTER. Kicking the main source of traffic from your money losing platform was not smart... that's what happens when you have a leftist ideologue as CEO
"Alternatives to hyper-inflated stocks like Twitter: stocks that are actually profitable, have reasonable P/E ratios and are paying dividends.Real estate, which is booming due to low interest rates.Precious metals like gold and silver.Corporate and municipal bondsCommodity futures- there are many different ones to choose.Being long in hyper-inflated securities is very risky business and is NOT the only game in town.Hedge funds will be driving down the price of stocks like Twitter via massive shorting, much like they did to unprofitable companies like Gamestop, Express, AMC Entertainment, Bed, Bath and Beyond. A short squeeze opportunity in stocks like Twitter will only occur after a massive amount of shorting has occurred, which is in the distance future. Twitter's current short position is a very modest 2.7%.Good all to all."
"Twitter Bans Over 70,000 QAnon Accounts in Conspiracy Crackdownyou the man Dorsey"
“QMarjory QGreene falsely states...” will be one of the most common tweets and headlines until Coup crew founding member QMarj resigns or is impeached.
Brenda I would like to know where u think TWTR is going today?
if twitter wasnt actually worried about other platforms like parler and Gab then it wouldnt be working so hard to take down parler etc. The fact is theyre very worried and their next earnings will show that. Numbers wont lie.
"Yesterday in the last three minutes of trading 1.4 million shares were traded in a .65 to .40 cent trading range, here is the kicker the shares being booked was 2000 to 35,000 that amount of shares hitting the close in such large blocks and pretty much at the bid would indicate that one or more FUNDS are off loading to whoever is willing to buy them.Mom and Pop retail investors are done and won't be back anytime soon."
"No Dotard, no problem! TWTR long and strong."
She says to follow Parler......
"j, another DNC mouth breather following yep, ""John"""
My favorite short. Thanks twitter.
Dorsey's anti free speech agenda is more important to him than his concern for stakeholders......this isn't going to go unnoticed...this will continue to tank....
3 million new accounts in last 12 days. Guess which service? Hint: it ain’t Twitter.
markets crashing
"What happens when parlor is back and, on top of it, Gab's phone with its independent operating system (that allows Parler) starts to sell like hot cakes."
"The left wingers seem to enjoy knocking on the doors of conservatives and interrupting their private lives with ""peaceful"" protests. Why does the right not reciprocate against the likes of Dorsey, Stacey Abrams, AOC, the entire squad, etc? Both sides are entitled to peaceful protests, right?"
Gab is running smoothly and added 3 million new subscribers in 12 days. Plus they value and respect free speech. These folks aren't coming back TWTR.
Robert E Lee birthday. Market closed.
"I have no idea what hedge fund or individual is holding this up/pumping this up. BUT, it seems artificial. I hope the SEC is looking."
Will close below 70 today.
Take your gains today and run ... In Germany is way down.
The decision may backfire on Twitter if half the country decides not to use its platform.

Let it fall!!!!! I never in my life wished so bad that billionaires would lose billions. I don't bother them why they gotta bother me and take my Parler away?
Imagine buying a company that is working to destroy your liberties
Hope it goes to 0
If f___ing SNAP worth almost 100B market cap then TWTR should be at least 150B market cap.
Time to short now
NASDAQ is even and TWTR is up over 3.5%!! Does anyone REALLY believe this BS?!
and here I thought the twitter communists would at least get one day in the green.
"If you are on the RMS Twitter, I recommend abandoning ship. This ship is sinking, india is banning Twitter inside the county which is the 3rd largest user of Twitter. Insiders are selling off. Jack Dorsey is currently incoherent, what ever ""REEEEEEE"" means."
I don't think Dorsey cares about the share holders one bit
So is how does Dorsey plan to spin his new user count next earnings? Maybe he is hoping for chinese customers.
"My prediction is always very conservative! When I say 37 by the end of next week, it’ll turn out to be 33 or below! LOL"
"Hey longs, get out of this now. It's going to collapse."
Where's that bounce Jack worshipers?
Yahoo the pioneer of social media. Rise of the Phoenix?
SELL everything that is associated with suppression of free speech unless you appreciate communist control going forward
Twatter had this coming for months. Sure glad Dorkey stepped up his game the last few weeks by taking his mask off to reveal the CCP-sponsored censorship. Making money is too easy on the backs of these Demonrat sympathizers.

Can't wait to see my short position quadruple in remaining weeks
TWTR's multiple is priced for double digit growth. Where is that going to come from?
Dow up because of oil. NASDAQ down because it is overvalued...for the moment...especially Twister.
This company should be put out of business once and for all.
This is SO MUCH fun. You just KNOW there will be hard data soon about how many MILLIONS of users Jackoff has lost for Twitter! Look out below....!!!
"The CEO of Twitter chose the side that locked down D.C. with over 40,000 armed military personnel. Only the extremely wealthy and “elite” were welcome. Once you begin to understand that you begin to understand what’s happening in the U.S."

BUT EVEN MORE RELEVANT the Public Utilities cannot turn you off for your political views - why shouldn’t these fundamental consumer services not be subject to similar oversight? And, oh by the way, Al Gore invented the internet upon which they have built their businesses!!"

suspended people is actually considered progress... it's time for unit
My friend called this exactly. He made his profits in the premarket and got out before the market opened.
My dog just defecated on a liberal newspaper with Jack Dorsey and Nancy Pelosi on the same page. A Double-whammy.
Only dems can rationalize that paid member growth slippage and increasing expenses are not as important as a slight increase in revenue. Twitter will fade away because of its one sided views and disrespect of the only president that really worked for all of the people. Someday a great black leader is going to day that and it will open the eyes of many.
Please some group or organization with the ability start a website listing all firms that advertise on FB and Twitter so believers in free speech can know whose products to boycott.
no profits and destroying growth. run for the exits.
"Pressed Short. My favorite lunch. I could have it with a Rhine wine. Because I’m a capitalist. Not some filthy grimey complainer about other people’s enterprises, creations, and business models."

Sad day in America when the liberal/socialist big tech media companies shut down free speech! And at the same time limit any other social media company/s (like Parlor) with the ability to compete in the market! Now we as Americans get to see what it's like in other socialist countries. And the saddest thing is how young Americans think socialism is OK. That's what you get when the majority of liberal /socialist teachers and professors are brainwashing them in the schools.
Wow looks like its going to be an ugly week for TWTR next week
"I cancelled Facebook already ( really the worst ) , Twitter tomorrow , and Amazon next ( we need to support local stores anyway )"

"Beats by 7 cents, beats revs. The train is leaving."
Just another Liberal analyst Holding this up so his company can bail out...
"“Anyone else feeling beyond let down?” one top post on a popular QAnon forum read. ""It's like being a kid and seeing the big gift under the tree thinking it is exactly what you want only to open it and realize it was a lump of coal.""Not a lump of coal. Underwear and t-shirts. Because santy clause is your mom and dad, and a lump of coal implies he's real and thought you were bad that year. But the TRUTH is underwear and t-shirts, and a prickly wool sweater for school. Now grow up, start thinking about a job, shave, smell nice. Try."
cancel culture twits...
CRAMER says BUY in a dip. You won't be able to get a better dip than this. LOAD it up

Stop buying shares Jack you're going to need that Money for the Antitrust suits. COLLUSION
"It's the perfect time for a competitor to disintermediate Twitter. Their base is stagnant and they clearly are biased. Like the monolith, we once knew called Silicon Valley, Twitters relevance is starting to fray."
Haha Twitter may have pushed conservatives to the side but he’s out of league in this field. Market is going to crush his company. People with feelings need not apply!
Kamel-Joe has unveiled the nation's new flag.
Tremendous volume in the $60 calls that expire this Friday. All aboard!

"Joe can't hide behind fences, 35,000 guard, and 40,000 armed police forever. Or does he intend to try and run the nation from his basement, same as he ran his campaign of electoral theft?"
well that is great to me because they were not making a dime before TRUMPS tweets in fact they were on their way out!! TRUMP MADE TWITTER WHAT IT IS TODAY. I hope twitter fails so bad !! FREEDOM OF SPEECH !
"11:59am EST on Jan 20th, 2021. By then this will be a date that lives in infamy."
70 and i am not surprised nor excited still
Pillow Boy was on the NewsMax today and even the anchor walked of the set. Priceless.
"I deactivated my Twitter account.Too bad, it take 30 days to be deleted in effect.I wish I could delete every thing immediately."
Twitter looks and feels old. It is so 20 years ago.
More competition coming! Young upstarts will disrupt the space!
"We the people have the right to choose, I choose freedom!!!! Down with Twitter!"
"Reading Babbitt’s Instagram one could think her husband and mother just wanted to split the AF pension and go to Cabo. It doesn’t appear they thought very much of her, didn’t try and get her help, psychiatry, deprogramming. In the 80s and 90s parents would pay $20K to have their kids deprogrammed from the Moonies and Krishna cults. Because they loved their kids. They didn’t point at their insta feeds and say Oh Well"
"Going back to 68 soon, came to high"
If you really don't like jack. Don't use square other company owned by Jack!
You might be a far left liberal if you believed that Dorsey banning the POTUS would be good for the SP...here’s your sign.
"SUPPORT Freedom Of Speech, your birth-right.Delete Twitter, FB, Amazon, Google and Apple accounts."
Going down after earnings!
"lol idk how people are selling this fast enough. do you realize that even if you are bullish on this stock, technicals are going to drive it lower, especially with entire market going down as it is. ETF selling will compound it towards end of the day + TWTR already at technical overbought level with RSI above 70."
Nothing beats watching you liberal twits loose your money on Twitter. Institutions are going to run real soon . It’s all about profit and how many subjects Twitter has
"I don't invest in the stock, but was a user for a decade. I'm from Canada, but had to delete the app. It was a seriously toxic place man. I flipped to conservative from liberal, generally mind my own business, and was only tweeting support and replies on conservative politician's posts and the hate I was getting was insane. Ended up deleting after some rando figured out where I worked and lived."
You don't buy shares in a company which has just had $5 Billion wiped out of its value in a single day. Instead you short the shid out of that company...
"We should cherish FREEDOM OF SPEECH"" not to suppress it. This is what Dorsey is doing. He should fire employees who are advocating it. Twitter is publicly traded company. The shareholders are in charge not employees."
"I went to Mexico. That's ""One"" time I got out of the cold unlike my constituents. Next week I will go to Mar a Lago to see my orange Master. That's ""Two"" times I am getting out of the cold unlike my constituents."
Investors REALLY need to view what Jack just said about suppressing a lot more free speech. I think that’s what you call DD.
My hearts are with you shareholders. You don't deserve what is about to happen to you investors. Twitter's censorship (communism) doesn't sit well with people in the free world. Twitter is gonna be gone so the sooner you bail the better off you'll be. Sorry but wake up.... stay free.
"If anybody from twtr views this forum, let Jack know that shorts are going to bring the pain on Monday."
"Pumped nicely for 2 weeks to get the old boys club out, terrible company, terrible site, terrible users, burn baby burn."
Politics aside. This company doesn’t make any money/thing! How is the price even at this level?
"Expect a number of positive recs from analysts in the coming days to support those large investors, institutions and mutual funds who have large investments in this Mao Company. Remember they did they for Enron as it was collapsing."
This is just the beginning. Buy
your freedom to speak is on the chopping block....make no mistake
"Time to dump Twitter stock. Half the nation is no longer allowed to post there. They just purged 4,000 of my conservative followers, with more to come. James Woods lost 173,000. Twitter is just a refrigerator magnet for the Democrat Party."
When you ban the President of the United States from your site that is meant to promote freedom of speech. On the grounds that he exercised his right to freedom of speech . ...
"Game over, folks! It's coming from Italy! Run or you will regreat!"
"Twitter's chart is as bearish as can be, SELL"
GAB get 40 millions peoples in 3days
I will never hire a Twitter employee
"Yagoo shadow banning is happening.... posts are not appearing, but when you click on your own feed the post appears"
Just a little breather today before TWTR resumes the slow and steady march to takeout the all-time high at 69. MAGA is doomed...lol!
"The future is here, people with traditional values need to unite. There will come a time when we need to sacrifice. Most importantly we need a place/website for those who have a voice become censored and there will be many. We seen this on the news articles, and we will see it on this format soon. Many of you younger Conservatives/people with US traditional values are way smarter than me, but I hope you get the general idea and stand your ground!"

Something about twitter's outrageous business success gets sad people who believe insane conspiracy theories all worked up.
Not one good reason to get in or stay in...I'm out.
Going down faster than Monica on Bubba Clinton.
"For anyone who doesn't think trump is important to twitter. Look at the stock chart and compare it to when he took office in 2017. In 2016 is when he was campaigning seriously. Now having looked at the chart, #$%$ do you think is going to happen now that Trump is banned? Trump is most likely going to move to an alternate platform and there is going to be mass exodus from the site. Get out before you lose your money!"
Jack is buying his own stock. How can that last. Twitter will collapse. Down $5 today. Watch and see.

"Dorsey you work for the shareholders, not the democratic party."
DEMENTIA boy's economy sinking dooooowwwwwnnnnnn
"I’ve done tech longer than bat kid has demanded attention. Nobody measures accounts. Nobody counts accounts. Hotmail doesn’t count how many registered of half registered or verified or unverified accounts it has and Microsoft doesn’t report that number. The numbers they do care about are Activity, page views, retweets, ad views, ad clicks. And looking at the group on 1/6? Not only are they freeloaders, they never click on Twitter ads, and never buy anything advertised. That’s why it’s 0 value keeping them and their impressions and their risky activities. Getting a sweet jasmine or mypillowbiter ad over at defunct GRUparler wasn’t so special."
twitter will be less than myspace by the end of the year.
Tweet this Twitter stock going down fast here haha 
T W T R reminds me of the reason my parents left CUBAIt's based on an idea that never works! NEVER!

"Hello $70, bye bye ppl who think Twitter is controlling FOS"
who bought yesterday when I said under 50 was on sale?
"Twitter has entered into a binding agreement to settle the shareholder derivative lawsuits that accused CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives of misleading shareholders about Twitter’s growth, while selling their own personal stock.The lawsuits were first filed in October 2019 by shareholder Jack Porter, and accused Dorsey and his colleagues of misrepresenting the growth of Twitter’s (TWTR) user base and artificially inflating the share price.Porter accused the defendants of exploiting their positions and selling “their personal stock holdings for hundreds of millions of dollars in insider profits” while possessing material, non-public information.The proposed settlement absolves Dorsey and his co-accused of any wrongdoing without any liability attributed to them or the company.As part of the agreement, Twitter will implement certain corporate governance adjustments and will pay for certain administrative costs. The company will not be required to make any additional payments.In addition, under the terms of the settlement, Twitter’s insurers will pay $38 million to the company that will be used for general corporate purposes. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion initiated a Hold rating on TWTR last week and set his price target at $45. This implies downside potential of around 6% from current levels."
This stock will be 10 dollars a share by June 1st.And Jack will be fired by July 1
Will be $20 by end of year if they keep censoring half the country.
"You can't buy your way out of your mismanagement, you know, Jack? You do know this, right??"

Maybe the Reddit people are at work?
"No amount of Yahoo! censoring on this message board can prop up TWTR but for so long. I'm excited about this trade! So much so, I doubled down early this morning. And TWTR is the queen of censorship, with rich uncles Jeff Z and Jeff B on the right and left. It may work for the Washington Post and Facebook, but Twitter needs open and honest tweeting to succeed. There's no emotional attachment to the platform. I, along with millions of others, simply and summarily deactivated my account. Others were de-platformed or censored or put on some kind of Dorsey-invented probation. The whole thing is a joke and will be a laughingstock at some point down the line in history!"
This company never coming back.
January 14th: “Dorsey: 'This Is Going to be Much Bigger Than Just One Account”. Run awayyyyy!
Jack seems scared. Traffic most be dropping fast

TWTR CEO reminds me oh how #$%$ Germany was started. I laugh everyday how their CEO takes action to censor people and fails to see how he is following the same path as so many evil dictators did before him only with out the same technology. Anyone who works there seems to be ok with this so what does that tell you about their company. Amazing.
Twitter finally free folks!!
Today could be the end of the historically long bull market and the beginning of a long anticipated bear market.

"Twitter lost over 1.1B in the trailing 12 months. They made money in two of the last 4 quarters. They're at their peak and the stock price reflects future growth, not a good combination.At the very best (from their perspective), the FANG companies have now opened up a huge demand for competing products. That goes for Amazon and Facebook, and to a lesser extent Google and Apple. They all just created tens of millions (perhaps more) who will jump ship to any halfway decent competing products.

First, they came after the Jew, but I wasn’t a Jew. Then they came after the Gypsies but I wasn’t a Gypsy. Then they..... etc.etc.By the time they came after me there was no one left to stand up and fight. So true these days!"

In 2017, Cons passed a $1.9:trillion tax cut, with $1,300,000,000,000 going to mega corporations, 450 billion going to 1%-er tax cuts, and $75 billion for rich people to get inheritance tax pass. In maga March 2020, when covid was killing 750 US citizen taxpayers a day, the Cons passed a $2 trillion stimulus without issue. Now it’s March 2021, and 2500 US citizen taxpayers die each day of covid, but the Cons say a $1.9 trillion stimulus for 46, It’s Too Expensive. What about the debt?That’s a Con for you."
Please tell us all. What future does tweet have? Most buy companies with a future!

TWTR has moles how great is that. JACK will need to move quick to have them censored. TWTR appear s to be starting to implode from within its own rank and file.
Support is crumbling...
Google and Apple trying to remove access to Parler to stifle the competition. Better get it now before the censors take it away. Time to move away from Apple and Twitter too. Also time to exist that the politicians remove Google's protected monopoly.

Cancel those that cancel.
Will give give back all the artificial gain by next earnings date.
I put 77k nervous dollars into this stock. I am selling tomorrow. Was hoping for good earnings. I played this a few years ago and haven't touched it since. Both times were huge moves.
Hi my name is Softcat. TWTR banned me for life because I got a ballot in the mail and posted it on TWTR. I’m just a cute cat and was just asking people on TWTR why I got a ballot in the mail when I’m not allowed to vote
"A couple weeks ago, Michigan state senate leader Mike Shirkey said he was working on new legislation that would require voters to show photo identification at the polls."
How will TWTR ever make money with 90 million less users?
"Good days of economic growth and prosperity are gone, new administration is a powerful job killing machine. Wait and watch."
Trump will lead the SPAC and GOP again so TWTR does not like that :)
Angela Merkel just condemned TWTR. Germany knows a thing or two because they did a thing or two...Pay attention America!

Twitter is basically just one big r/politics echo chamber subreddit at this point
"Shorted a lot at $74.5, most ever I put in 1 stock. This anti-American company has no place in America and shouldn't have existed in the first place. When the bubble pops, this will be in the pennies."

"Sold all my Apple shares and split the considerable proceeds between QCOM and AVGO. Next up, I was waiting to get the iPhone 12 for 5G capability ( I have an iPhone 8). Guess what? Going with the Samsung Galaxy (don't know what model yet). At least I know they will have the latest Snapdragon chipset from QCOM which is the best by far in the industry. It's going to be a little of a learning curve since I never used anything but iPhones, but I refuse to support in any way a company that censors people. It is up to us to make these companies understand this is not China or a banana republic dictatorship."
lots of liberals losing big money today. Hope it keeps up! Feel sorry for the normies though
Short Twitter and defund a liberal
"2015 ""Twitter supports free speech"". Fact check: FALSE"
Social media and media in general are distractions made for procrastination. Dump them all and you won't miss them after a few weeks of detoxing. You may just find time to connect with family and friends at a human level instead of fighting like animals or showing off like the thugs

Jack axx Dorsey You just lost at least 35% subscribers
Sell this stock tomorrow.
The hashtag “#AlexandriaOcasioSmollett” became a top trend on Twitter Wednesday as users connected the dots to find that the New York congresswoman wasn’t in the Capitol building during her “near-death experience.”
"The hole in the TWTR tire is not patched. A lot of air being blown into it today, but the end result will be the same. A flat tire! I'm short this stock, and I'm long others that are flying high today, so it's kind of a hedge investment, but I also think it's trash no matter what the market is doing!"
I can't wait for earnings...
This thing is going down faster than Camel toe on Willie Brown.
Bye bye jack

Twitter stock is going nowhere. It's at the same price it was 5 years ago.
The best way to “teach” a company is through consumer and shareholder’s decisions. Twitter is learning the lesson.
Liberals actually think Dorsey cares about them! 
Wow. 5 minutes here and it already dropped $1. It's uncanny.
the smartest thing you can do is buy and hold this through earns...

We all moved to GAB and other platforms yet Twitter keeps our frozen accounts 'open' (although we cannot tweet, comment, change our profile or even cancel our account) to make it appear they still have that many active users.They are faking the amount of users by holding these petrified account as 'open.The company is a fraud and the stock price will plummet far further once the true number of lost users is revealed.Sell."
"We should be happy that, for now, Chairman Xiden hasn't nominated Caitlyn Jenner for the dollar bill."

Dorsey will be jailed very soon. Leaked video from Satan himself detailing his true intent for the platform. Government not happy!
"Folks, Twitter has carpet bombed their platform. Literally a train wreck over there! Here's a first hand account from a Twitter orphan (I deactivated my acct): ""I'm still on there. It's like a ghost town. Everyday, my followers are getting cut or leaving. I'm an extremely small account anyways - 1700 followers. Now, only 1001.

We are loading up on TWTR here. I guess the Parler crew will be heading to FB next.

Jack Dorsey was working remotely on a private island in French Polynesia frequented by celebrities who are avoiding the paparazzi when the decision was made to ban Trumps account. Disconnect from his company may be an understatement.
Yesterday January 12 TWTR lost 5 billion in market capital. India looks appears to be taking a stand against Twitter the whole company is going to be banned from the whole country. Which has a population of over 1 billion.Question is how many people from india have a Twitter account?
"need an ETF to short liberal companies. Social media, woke sports, hollywierd etc etc etc"
Let me get this right. Twitter just got rid of the biggest draw on it's platform and just told all his followers to go F'm selves? Puts are going to be very expensive for this stock on Monday.
"I’m done with Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google. Time to breakup the monopolies!"
thanks for the gains 
"Everything is going by the book. Twitter announced its acquisition of newsletter platform Revue two days ago, but the company has already begun to integrate the product. Another reason that Dorsey is moving on from the Trumplikins flashback..."

"Hi Brenda, did I told everybody that this is going into $100s, YES it is destiny!!!!! Congratulation to all my fellow Twitterian"
I am out folks. Liquidated my Twitter long position. Any tine a company begins to Qualify their customer base it is never optimal for the bottom line. As a wise man once said to me: If you are all in agreement with me I do not need all of you! Long live Freedom of Speech!

Any company that treats its users and shareholders like this should be sold!
"So, I cancelled a week ago now. Honestly, I feel better. It was a good move."
"I quit Twitter 2 days ago after joining in 2013. I will eventually short both TWTR & Square stock. Not right away, but be patient, wait until you see the numbers lost during their earnings call, will be in the tens of millions. Bottom line is Twitter is really just a cesspool of people spewing their meaningless views. It’s trash "
Insider selling of SQ last week. Interesting...

"so apparently they want to cancel Luke Skywalker now too! "" it’s being claimed that there is “immense pressure” from within the company to ditch the Luke Skywalker and Baby Yoda storyline from all future plans."" ""Well, the unnamed author says that despite Hamill being very politically progressive, unnamed but apparently influential Lucasfilm employees associate Luke Skywalker with “conservatism, the patriarchy, male-dominated narrative, etc.” and want nothing to do with him."""
Where does Dorsey live? Anyone have an address?
this is doing incredibly well. unfortunately the market has been extremely bearish. for future reference im marking february as bearish. instead of sell in may and go away im marking my calendars to sell in january. will only buy in october and november. will never hold anything past january this market is extremely hostile towards retail investors.
Sell Twitter! oryour money!
Twitter is the laughing stock of the high-tech world.
"Hey Twitter investors, Dorsey doesn’t care about you, he’s made his money! Better sell quick before it’s too late!"
90% of fund managers will not let a stock that gave them 100% go backwards more than 25%We are close look out below when they start selling
"Takes a few days, the largest institutional owners have to meet and agree to get out of tweetsville. Then the deluge."
Never trust a 'business' run by a guy with a ring through his nose.
"Delete your twitter account. Do not invest in a company that loses money, and is losing market share. Dump this stock!"
"As a conservative I cannot buy shares in a company who hand money to organisations like BLM and Antifa. That's where your profits went. No one asked you, but you funded BLM and Antifa burning down the cities."
My prediction. 6-months and this will be on the Pink Sheets trading for 30c.
Going to $30 in near future
Where have all the shorts gone? Where have all the good times gone? LMAO
Glad I don’t use Twitter anymore.
Who would pay these prices. when the books say it's worth 1/5 of the current PPS
"Dropped under the First Support Point, the stop-losses are being taken out."
"TWTR down, NASDAQ up. Strong sell"
A very large sign to a professional trader that a company is going down is that I’m able to flip it consistently for a profit. Also one must add the concept that many big tech are leaving California wit informed decisions while Dorsey conducts his business from a private island. The warning signs are all here for long term investors. Day traders like myself however are enjoying it very much. I highly recommend not investing in Twitter long term.
"I would urge all patriotic Americans, all Turnip U alumni and all past contributors to the Turnip Foundation (which supported Children’s Cancer Centres and Disabled Veterans, but was unfortunately shut down) to give generously to Mar-a-lLago to support the foreign workers, property maintenance and legal costs."
"As soon as the bell ring, better yet in pre-market, just break the 45 mark, then it will slide to 40 by mid afternoon, let this corrupt/evil/wicked/ entity fall and crumble to ZERO. It will take some time, but I think we can get it to 30 by Friday. Sweet."

"My day keeps getting better. Twitter down $6 bucks so far to $45.50. Way to go @Jack!Get Woke, Go Broke! Can I hear $40?"
Market watch raised the target so wallstreet can get out. The volume is way up. The price is holding. They want to sell their shares to someone that doesn't know any better.

Who will Rasputin ban next? This insane CEO will bankrupt Twitter...
Will bite back Twtr at 40. Lately bagged 122 k after 6 years of misery but missed another 80 k after selling. I was only 2 weeks of lightning speed but nothing to say but regrets and I had a few.
$BTC investment made by $TWTR turns out to be a very bad move - already lost millions of dollars imo.
Run before it bankrupt
haha now its going the right way! people have finally opened eyes!
big suits trying to prop it up. wont work
How come twitter never removed any Black Lives Matter posts that organized many many riots that resulted in 29 deaths and 4 billion in damage?
How do you offend a conservative? tell him a lieHow do you offend a liberal? tell them the truth.
"Twitter is very unpopular amongst teenagers. Now the company is self sabotaging itself, will lose a million+ active users this year. RIP future growth"
I'm changing my price Target from $5 to $0. Sorry for the confusion I was being a little bit optimistic.

How will TWTR do when Markets correct even 5%? LMAO
Sell this stock. Protect Freedom
"Right now on the news, they are talking about a lawsuit against TWTR that was just filed where they allowed porn videos of a 13 year to be posted on their website. When he complained , they said ""it didn't violate their policies"" That is an 8 or 9 figure , gold plated lawsuit right there."

I wouldn’t fall for this trap. This is how fake the stock market is. Something is coming and I believe this will come down like a house of cards
Democrats on election night
Twatter is providing the model for all brownshirt wannabe organizations. Jack Dorsey has enlisted in Goebbels's army.

Good report
America land of the caged by tech? Short short short
"Apple, Amazon and Twitter are acting like the 5 families of the tech world. They should be charged with the Rico Act, its' a coordinated hit."
"How did Twitter's stock price ascend to where it is today considering the facts it has a negative P/E ratio, and does not pay a dividend? The answer is large revenue growth projections. Recent actions made by the CEO have greatly diminished Twitter's ability to grow their revenue in the foreseeable future, coupled this with the emergence of new competitors like Parler and gab, looming class action lawsuits from disgruntled stockholders, and the recent revelation of its association with child sex abuse, the big players on Wall Street are going to give Twitter's stock price a crew cut in the not to distance future."
I don't want to live in a world where Big News and Big Tech dictate my values and action.

"If MLK had a dream & he tweeted it, that too would be censored."
SOVIET RUSSIA WOULD EMBRACE the behavior of TWITTER AMAZON FACEBOOK... They need to suffer severe consequences..
So does Dorsey know that he lost half his assets? Users are his assets. But he is still stuck with high debt and only half of his assets operating. Timber!
Amazon AWS taking down Parler tomorrow. That's their new reality. Ours is all of these socialists/marxist/globalist/DeepState/MSM/SocialMedia cabal is about to feel the truth on their crimes.
$3.2 BILLION of TWTR's market cap has already been erased. The worst is yet to come. It couldn't happen to a more deserving company.

Twitter lost $10 Billion in one week. Just think you could run some African countries for a year with that kind of money.
A 20% haircut seems too reasonable for the corruption
looks like shorters and their political agenda didn't work today finished green today with new price target 60.00
"Twitter way undervalued and still not fully understood by the masses, but that is changing , the value isnt in the useless status updates or even what celebrities have to say, its an agregator of human analyzed, curated, and created data, news, and more. Those subscription features are going to make sense. You may think im crazy but im pretty sure, it will be $150 within 6 months."
I bought 500 contracts of puts after earnings. Earnings is gonna be brutal.
This is essentially a lotto play now but the potential upside is extremely less than the potential downside.
Nobody is interested in state run media
"Market is up, and this isn't. Going to fall today."
Shareholders sue Twitter for losing all of their money on purpose.
This company already losing money in business. It will be sold to Chinese company.
Another green day for TWTR...thank you MAGA!
Democrats vs Trump . 2 battles. Democrats lost twice. Team Trump is very strong.
the best thing you can do is buy and hold through this evenings earnings. They will show you

"TWTR = SELL !!! Send this down !!! They are trying a head fake !!! Short all you can. Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can !!!!!!"
No matter the politics Twitter is Toast!
"All in all, not a bad day. BECAUSE I SHORTED TWTR early this morning... The one thing Jack and his type cannot handle is getting embarrassed on public forums. You know he must be on the phone with Yahoo right now trying to shut us down! But it's not happening, lol!"

The same guy who egged on Ashley Babbitt and then filmed her being shot and dying. IS WALKING THE STREETS FREE AS A BIRD. He's CIA. Look at the pictures of him in paramilitary uniform with a semi-automatic rifle on his shoulder, and a holstered sidearm. It was a total set-up. The Boogaloos were caught on camera before the event saying they were there to cause to trouble and that they supported BLM. Work it out."

"Twitter MUST Disclose material USER loses via 8K or face Investor lawsuitsRule 405 under the Securities Act defined the term “material” as follows: “when used to qualify a requirement for the furnishing of information as to any subject, [materiality] limits the information required to those matters to which an average prudent investor ought reasonably to be informed before purchasing a security."
Sell this stock. Save our freedom
If it was the left... They wouldn't quit.. They'd be back protesting at the capitol building and the media would be supporting them ..

"no matter what side of the fence you are on, the 1st amendment right cant be suppressed, might as well call us North Korea if you are going to do that, hows that 4 Billion dollar loss feeling this morning Jack ?"
Shorts are crying
The market is now an illusion. Propped up because those who control don't want it collapsing on their watch. Wait...wait....wait...and see what happens! Just saw a tape from a witness to the fact that Rosenstein created a dirty crimes division with......Shawn Henry.....Crowdstrike. So many horrific individuals tied to companies in the US.
i think twitter has lost 50 percent of their users who would never come back since people found non censoring alternative solution
"TENS OF MILLIONS OF USERS LEFT THIS COMPANY YET TWITTER STILL HOLDS THEIR ACCOUNTS RANSOME.I, like million of others, have a frozen account on Twitter which I can not close. Twitter won't let me.The majority of Twitter users are gone. The remaining accounts are no different than the Wells Fargo fake account scheme from a few years ago.The stock is a fraud and it's future is doomed.Good Luck."
GAB reports adding 1 million users a day. I've been on GAB for about a month it's a nice platform. running slow right now as they scramble.
TWTR shareholders support cancel culture. Oblige them and cancel TWTR shares.

A copy was given to Tucker Carlson, who unfortunately ""lost it in the mail"" on the same night that his dog ate his homework.Rudy Giuliani is hopeful that his client won't stiff him for all the successful legal work he conducted in more than 60 courts, including his submission to the Supreme Court (which sources have said Mr. Giuliani also intends to sue on behalf of his client).Bigly.

TWTR's earnings report will be very misleading. The disaster that#$%$ this company did not start til after the end of the quarter - so the quarter that's about to be announced will not show the disaster ahead. Hopefully some longs and TWTR supporters will double up once earnings are announced and then get smoked when the next quarter's earnings are announced. Single digits are inevitable. You were warned - again.
squeeze coming. if you trade stocks based on your politics you lose.applying standards is a good thing. you dont get to say water is dry. facts dont have two sides.see you at 57

An article from Seeking Alpha from 2 days ago said that at the end of Q3 TWTR had 187M users. Wanted to share this number because it will give us a baseline to see what percentage of the people delete their accounts.

I will not use Twitter ever again
"Not trying to be a negative Nancy, I am glad this is up so high, but my goodness I get a bad gut feeling seeing the stock price so high.... it just seems like far to high of a run up far to quickly in a pandemic with a lot of these stock my gut feeling says some kind of huge correction is coming soon... who knows maybe the market will keep going into tulip territory but the run up the past year has been nothing short of incredible and I don't think its going to last forever."
How many other countries want to block twitter after the past year!
"The Left promotes a cultural of DEATH: dead babies- abortion, dead soldiers- endless foreign wars, dead birds including bald and golden eagles- wind turbines, and a ""dying"" economy via executive orders, onerous regulations and taxes."
"Patriots need to get serious about extricating GOOG from their daily lives. Yes, they have been more discreet, but they're demons in disguise. Through Youtube and Search, their level of censorship is greater and more damaging than TWTR. And, don't forget the harmful impacts GOOG has on privacy. Having said that, let's short more TWTR."
Laura Loomer just compared Jack Dorsey's censoring of Free Speech to the beginning of the Holocaust. This is why she wore a yellow star when she chained herself to Twitter's fence.

"If and when the market reverses course, Twitter will lead the pack of bears to winter hibernation. Right now, it seems that FB and AMZN are propping up TWTR. But it's turning into a lonely outpost over there. From a vibrant gold-rush bastion to an abandoned old ghost town..."

"If there was every a time for people to boycott traitorous companies this is it. Withholding our money and support is our greatest weapon, even more powerful than our vote. If more people could understand and exercise this we would have these companies and politicians on their knees. Our money is their life blood."
"Sold all my shares. The tech company is supposed to back freedom of speech, not blocking it."
"Soros is probably shorting TWTR, as far as he would be concerned, TWTR is just collateral damage, served its purpose."
shareholders are going to have a rock-solid case when the class action lawsuit hits Twitter. I'm pretty sure there was no disclosure that they were getting ready to become a political lobbying organization on behalf of the Democratic Party. not to mention the idea that they are working with the other Faang stocks to become a communist anti-free speech platform
This stock is being propped up by J Dorsey and his lefty club. They are buying shares on the side to make it seem more successful. Expect a significant fall in Q1 of 2021!
I see this stock in the single digits in less than 6 months. If the only people allowed on Twitter are all in lock step in opinion and thought it will become extremely boring. What ever happened to the concept of diversity? This company has destroyed itself. I’m out tomorrow. Selling out of Apple and Facebook as well. We are not a Marxist country and companies that promote policies against freedom of speech should not be supported. This must stop.

Big tech will have a blood week come monday. Twitter FB Apple google ... drag down with it the nasdaq points. Even the left traders know it's coming. Massive exit coming.
"Reminder $TWTR folks. Jack Dorsey owns SQ. He is also CEO at $SQ so he is mismanaging two companies by being politically extreme and alienating businesses owners from using SQ’s inferior product. How much is he truly focusing on one let alone two companies when he has been censoring mainstream America and giving a forum to rioters, looters, arsonists and their associated organizations.$PYPL and other alternatives are the way to go. Don’t be known as “doing a Dorsey”. Self inflicting financial harm to yourself and worse others who have no say and mistakenly invested in $SQ not knowing.Go check out the public records, the vast majority of Dorsey’s holdings are with $SQ He has very little left by comparison in $TWTR.Sell and save yourself the grief."

Jack Dorsey has repeatedly lied to lawmakers about targeting conservatives for censorship.
BLM burned down buildings looted store and caused millions and millions of dollars worth of damage. Twitter says nothing.
"I think the only way Twitter is going to shake this censorship, big brother label is to fire Jack! As an American, I can never stomach owning this company, with him there. Twitter must acknowledge they did wrong, fire Jack and a sincerely promise they will ensure free speech!"

"I just can't see how #TWTR survives going forward. It's not as fun as SNAP, IG or TikTok and its not as interactive and comprehensive as Facebook. It's not as useful as texting, WhatsApp, or ZOOM. And it just removed its #1 content creator. It's basically the AskJeeves of social networks which makes sense since it came out before the iPhone."
Parler found a server. I personally like GAB but will support any social media that supports free speech and dissent of any kind. MAGA
"We can now see that Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the entire Democratic Party are on a full scale assault of America. Not sure everyone understands just how radical this will be."

Why would any American invest in a company that is against the 1st Amendment ? One could say this company is anti American and should be shut down .....
Short this stock and pledge your gains to the 2024 re-election campaign. That way Jack can be one of the largest contributors. Sweet!

Timber...
TWTR is infiltrated by CCP.BAN TWITTER.
Would love to see this thing gap down into the 44s next week just enough to trigger a bunch of stop losses. Anyone who bought this commie propaganda tool on the dip deserves to lose their money.
"The latest twitee prodject of the user getting paid money is explosive........

Evolution is a funny thing just like the car replaced the horse and buggy Twitter will be replaced by another social media web page !Dorsey crossed the line and he is finished  Die Twitter die
messing with free speech is a bad idea
We got a leaker!
Democrats who have decried the building of a wall on the Southern Border and tried to stop it seem to be just cool with fencing keeping Americans out of their government as long as it protects Congress.
Deleted my Twitter account today. Good riddance.
Do People understand that other countries are shutting down TWTR?
"Lock THEM Up! One of six men federally charged on suspicion of being involved in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year pleaded guilty Wednesday.Ty Garbin, 25, signed an agreement pleading guilty in federal court in Michigan to the sole charge against him -- kidnapping conspiracy.According to the agreement, Garbin will continue to cooperate with prosecutors against the five other defendants, all of whom have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping conspiracy."
Here are some alternatives to $FB fakebook and Twitter.*Rumble *Gab *Telegram*MeWe *Parler (will be back online hopefully)

How long are you going to hold this garabge? Where exactly is the growth they are literally destroying their platform.
I guess Walmart will be getting my Amazon business now. Later AMZN.
Hope TWTR and other platforms that decided to become arms of the woke left mob will find their way to irrelevance.

omg poor twtr... it is going down for some times
"how about facts. Average consensus for share price a lot lower than current. EPS is negative, yet share price is going up?"
It's clear that twitter is going down the echo chamber road.. The masses will not pay to join the Twitter Nazi party..
Took out the 50 MDA last Monday. Up next 200 MDA at 39.43. That's where the free fall really accelerates. This is a PSA. Bail out now!
"Let's use some of our profits generated by shorting and buying puts on Twitter, to help low-income people who will be hit hard from rising prices for gasoline, electricity, and basic necessities like groceries caused by thoughtless executive orders."
That fencing around the Capital? It may not be going away anytime soon.
Twitter has transformed social media to social nightmare under the disguise of free speech and ended with censorship of people and political views that lead to loss of trust to company and its leaders. It also damage its business and investors have lost their trust as well. Only institutions still holding Twitter shares right now will soon face the pressure from their clients and exit their positions in kitchen sink next few days or weeks.
"Greg Abbott has already DEMANDED the return of the Texas national guard. It was an abuse of power to use them, and now that dementia Joe has used them, they are sleeping out in the cold."
Don't want to be the one holding the bag. World leaders are speaking out against Twitter. Better get out before the full on free fall.
Shudder to think where stock price will be when user metrics plunge negative
Why does the Ayatollah still have an active account?
"Since jack has shown how well his company can censor free speech, maybe the CCP will be interested in a version they can use to feed propaganda to their citizens?"
$TWTR I did not realize Jack Dorsey was also the CEO of $SQ - yikes.
"due to the recidivism rate, ie, users who deactivate yet return, TWTR believes users are too weak to resist. what do you have to say about that?"
free speech is gone
Don't believe any you read on the net from here on out. Let your eyes guide you as to what is really going on.
"All the FANG stocks are down. Just the start, keep shorting. Ka-Ching!"
"MySpace fell because there was no user base when FB came online. They lost their user base. Same thing happening with $TWTR. Lost a bunch of users and hasn't been profitable.I, on the other hand, have profited off their options. They will make lots of money while they tank"
"Bottom line the user retention rate and new user rates will be down dramatically. The less eyes on the platform the less ad revenue. There is a direct correlation. A Self inflicted wound. As large institutional holders continue too unwind their positions heading into earnings, law firms are putting together their class action lawsuits. The gap down on earnings during the after hours will likely be dramatic. Hilarity will ensue "
Pravda the Soviet news paper had the largest circulation. Didn’t allowed descending views.and claimed anybody not agreeing was a criminal.Like Twitter Pravda lasted 30 years how many years can Twitter last ?

Just 2% without any news. Hyped to go short.
"I consider myself a moderate. Leaned left most of my life and now lean slightly right. This latest move by Twitter has even me wanting to leave the platform. If I feel this way, I cannot imagine what actual conservatives are feeling. To me Twitter has signed their death warrant as a social media Giant. It is a matter of time before this stock gets cut in half. Maybe I am completely dead wrong. But I don't think so."

"Telegram surpassed 500 million active users in January, according to a statement from Pavel Durov, the messaging app’s founder. Durov noted that 25 million people downloaded the platform in just 72 hours. In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA.This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5M new users signed up every day. We’ve had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different.People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users."

"It's less about Jack banning the President and more that he is able to ban whoever hurts his feelings. If TWTR is able to censor the New York Post for an accurate story without doing any research or validation, they can do this to anyone.

"I would suggest using G A B and d issenter the free speech browser there are some fringe elements but most people are using them because they are truly concerned about repression of free speech in the United States. The best thing about D issenter is you can add your own comments to any webpage without Orwellian like censorship. Also, try bizfluence an alternative to LinkedIn. TWTR is on the decline, without diversity of opinion you simply don't have democracy, people are voting with their feet."

"In an effort to keep Big Tech out of Florida’s political sphere, DeSantis proposed a number of measures including a $100,000 daily fine for companies that deplatform political candidates. Additionally, actions taken by companies to effectively promote a candidate will be considered campaign contributions.The governor proposed measures to enhance user rights as well, including allowing individuals and the Florida attorney general to sue companies over violations of individual protections, as well as requiring companies to provide full disclosures of actions taken against individuals for violating policies."
I urge everyone to take a look at TWTR's chart. Set the range to 1 year daily. What do you think? It looks like a small pen1s is forming. LOL!!!
Will the cute bird loose both wings today and just fall

Twitter is going down!
Over the last 4 years we've seen people beaten in airports and on streets and ejected from restaurants just because they were wearing a hat someone didn't like. Attending a political rally was to walk through a throng of shrieking belligerents. To ask unpopular questions (or express an opinion) about how votes are counted and processed and how a count can run negative is to be called a liar and deranged. Where is Twitter and Facebook during all of this? Busy helping America decay.
Twatter is next. $FB $TWTR
"Twitter and Facebook not only rob you of your fundamental right of freedom of speech, they also remove your right to privacy, since they SELL YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. And you probably wondered how you got hacked or how your personal data ended up on the Dark Web?"

Because he was angry he'd lost an election."

The discourse on twitter all of a sudden is substantive and reality-based. Users love it. Great business decisions have been made over the past month.
Where’s the guy who was posting “$50 stock” for the past 6 years?
Twitter has all the necessary wings to fly to the $100's.
I get the feeling that TWTR unwittingly united both the left and the right against big tech and social media. The left just doesn’t know it yet.
Exit before this plummets
"Cathie Wood and Ark bought a ton of TWTR yesterday and today into earnings. For that sole reason, we will not see red tomorrow Bc she will continue to load up. $65 tomorrow"
Time for some of you Twitter insiders to call Project Veritas to get your 15 minutes of fame and do a good thing for decency!
"The US is focusing on American politicians but the actions by TWTR et al have an international blowback. Basically, people like German Chancellor Merkel have openly stated disagreement with TWTR and others because they see that they could be silenced. But, those countries will shut them down first. Not good for the shareholder value. Too much downside risk."
Down to single digit volume of buyers.... lol
This is absolutely beautiful! Patriotism wins every time! Hedge funds dumping TWTR and FB due to legal instability!

"The market is up today supposedly because weekly unemployment claims were not off-the-wall terrible , just terrible. These new claims are historically high when compared to pre-covid levels. Sounds like really ""good news"" to me. It is reasonable to expect retraction later today, when an objective understanding of this new data emerges. Twitter owners have been given a temporary gift to sell at a profit."

Wait till Parler comes back up
"I admit I have never used Twitter and had to do some research on what value it has. I am baffled as to why people need a social media avenue that seems to divide our country. After accessing Twitter, I an glad I never got involved in the drama. You have to ask yourself are you a better person with Twitter in your life? The healing won't begin until services like this get some controls."
Repukes are getting dumped left and right by private industry. Haha! You got to love it! Now walmart and disney are dumping them.

Artificial 'bump' up isn't fooling anyone. This stock has *nothing* good in its future -- it's going to the 20's.
Who would be buying this stock? It going nowhere. You will see a bump from those holding out for miracle. It's dead. Jack Dorsey just tossed it away.
This will be just like yesterday.....open slightly up and then fall all the rest of the day.

Just love seeing this slowly tank! Dorsey=dope! 
Will hit 66 within week
"Have you had enough yet? No coincidence it underperformed the market again. The company destroyed itself, with no regard for the shareholders, just the selfishness and loathing driven by Jack Dorsey part time CEO, has no significant financial stake in this either.What does he care?But he does care about $SQ where he has his wealth and is also CEO.Maybe SQ should be treated the way Dorsey treated TWTR shareholders, which was with no regard."
Even Uganda realizes Twitter is done.
"Has anyone else noticed whats going on in Portland....People are beginning to run over "" peaceful protestors "" with their cars..."
"Odd isn't it, that an app which is based on trying to get people to communicate is actively trying to silence its users. Ditch Dorsey and Ditch Twitter."
"Give it 5 years and TWTR will be under $ 5.00 a share , Conservatives will go elsewhere and liberals just want their opinions only ."
Just deactivated my account.
Jack Dorsey won’t need all these employees after he looses half of his business! Awww the poor liberal putz s will be jobless
"The user who goes by the name “Stephen”, he is a winner lmao. Look at his posts, and do EXACTLY the opposite of what he predicts! He’s been saying Twitter will crash close to a year now! I bought as much as I possibly could since the price fell to $30... I’ve made $200k just in 2021 alone so far doing the exact opposite of a genius prophet like “Stephen” The brother hasn’t figured this out yet, he does what he predicts. But as long as you do the opposite of what he predicts, you will make money. Nobody tell him "
Deactivated.
another red day when the market is soaring... why did we invest in this dog?
"Lol “Texas”McCarthy worries liberals will seize upon the catastrophic grid failure in Texas, the loss of life and injuries.

Wait!! How about parler taking over???? 
"This is what greed is all about. He should be arrested for price fixingTexas freeze allows Jerry Jones’ natural gas company to “hit jackpot”Charean WilliamsWed, February 17, 2021, 9:51 PMAs many as 4 million Texans have had no power during the historic winter weather experienced by the state this week. As of Wednesday night, 7 million in the state had water issues with either boil notices or no water at all.Fingers are pointing. Pipes are bursting. Homes are flooding. Grocery store shelves are emptying. Gas pumps are drying. Nerves are fraying.The Insurance Council of Texas said insurers are expecting the winter storm of 2021 to become the costliest weather event in the history of the state, topping Hurricane Harvey.So how, you ask, does this relate to pro football? Glad you asked.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones owns a Frisco-based natural gas producer that is cashing in on a surge in prices for the fuel, Bloomberg reports."
even if you don't like mega you should still have the decency of not supporting a company that censors
Twitter saw its market cap plunge by $3.5 billion.way to go jack!
Just make sure you go to your settings and DELETE the account. DEACTIVATE.
This is another GME. wait till next earnings.

Ya the only reason I had Twitter was to see what POTUS says next !
"Since Yahoo keeps deleting my posts: Sell this stock, protect Freedom!!!!"
jack caught by project veritas is deeply troubling... he should be removed by the board for abandoning his fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders... he actions are tanking the stock. I will be asking my mutual funds to divest as well..
going to buy some shares..... once its gets below one dollar a share.thinking 70 cents per share is a good entry price ?should happen around the middle of march.
Support Point is at 44.93. Take that out and this thing is in freefall...
Just short more
Twitter up $28.00 since January. you the man Dorsey
the yahoo communist minimum wage censors won't let you mention all the rioting and looting that took place last summer.....
"With only a relatively small amount of their shares being shorted, 2.7%, many hedge firms might short Twitter in the very near future. Couple this possibility with mutual funds unloading some of their shares, Twitter's stock price could be in deep trouble."
"Twitter is a dead man walking now. The videos of Jack saying how he was going purge conservatives from the platform, put the final nails in the coffin."
A breakout I’ve (we’ve) been waiting 3-4 years for. Sit back and watch!

"I hate this stock. Even with a miss, how does the market justify such a huge discount to other companies in the social media space?"
Limp wrist Dorsey and his embarrassing nose ring are about to get hammered worse than he’s ever known. This isn’t China Jacky boy! Censoring politicians in America is not a good look!
Impeach the president. Now
Shorts are scared everywhere

good entry point ... that is if you want to lose half of your money!
censorship is not good for the stock price
North Dakota just hit Twitter hard with a new Bill. Good riddance!
"Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can. Make money on these Commies !!!"
TWTR and FB should be made to realize that they need us more than we need them. Especially true of TWTR.
Buy/cover short
"communist social media dropping like a dead fly, love to see it!"
Boycott Twitter advertisers! I canceled my account but tell me who they are and my business will go elsewhere.
twtr CEO eyes look like satans...
It is spreading all over the net that Pelosi has been arrested. Pelosi hasn't been on Twitter since the 8th. She tweets frequently and 1 of her comrades would have covered for her by now.
"For the first time in my life I've shorted a stock this week. And when it briefly climbed, shorted it again! TWTR is in a graveyard spiral, and I intend to ride it all the way to the ground. I'm up $250 so far. You don't deny the duly-elected President of The United States free speech!"
In short as of right now
Isn’t Twitter violating the Constitution that our families fought for? Maybe I’m right.

"TWTR is past its prime. No matter what price targets the insiders put on it. With 0 earnings and 0 dividends, censorship of half its users, and upcoming govt regulations worldwide, eventually it is going down. Social media doesn't stay the same forever. A new popular platform shows up and it is done. Enjoy while it lasts. I expect it to eventually reach its 2016 lows. Yes, there will be rallies and sell offs on the way. It won't go down in a straight line."
"'Freedom Social Netwok' is almost completed...in the meantime, sell twitter."
"Notice The Words In The First Amendment Below Where It Reads Peaceably! Plus How Can Someone Speak Freely When They Are Afraid For Their Safety!

It Is 2021 I Know We Are Smarter Than This!The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition. It forbids Congress from both promoting one religion over others and also restricting an individual’s religious practices. It guarantees freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely. It also guarantees the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and to petition their government."
"The Biden administration has now directed the IRS to link tax returns with party registration. 1984 is here folks, and fully supported, no, advocated by TWTR"

"With all the legal beagles big tech has, you would have thought someone in the legal profession would have been aware of Military code 11.3. I guess when you are above it all, following the law is not a requirement. The lawsuits that will follow Dorsey and Zuckerberg without corporate protection will last years."

"From what I see, you have a company trading at 100 times next years earnings banning people due to political disagreement. Not sure I understand why anyone invests in this company anyway. Growth rate is very low and multiple is extremely high. Not sure I get it."
TWTR is going down to $20! Run Away Quickly!
"I'm out! Cancelling my accounts at facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram!"
nothing said or done about BLM riots that's ok speech- well it's ok then to cancel TWTR accounts too--cancel culture is going to find out canceling can go both ways
Can't believe this stock is still going strong. I sold too early but I made a nice profit buying just before the earnings release. Way to go for all who held.
I am now in great company. I too have been permanently suspended from Twitter.. Welcome to the club Mr. President. See you on Parler.
This stock is trying to become the next gamestop. Soon this will drop back down to $24 where it should be.

"These big tech company's are gonna learn a valuable lesson, Republican's and conservative's buy stuff too. Now these same company's can watch as Republican's and conservative's take their business elsewhere."
There will be a correction one day and this stock will be one that goes belly up.
"Does anyone really thinks, that Twitter will have two times higher performance in the future, than it was predicted in Jan20 during the unprecedented times of high economic growth?"
Twitter = Enron
Today was a blast. Thanks to the longs for hanging in there so the ride down is not too quick for the Patriot's extended enjoyment.

"MeWe, a social media app centered around data privacy, has seen a surge in downloads in recent weeks as Big Tech companies crack down on user content. People all over the world are leaving Facebook and Twitter in droves because they are fed up with the relentless privacy violations, surveillance capitalism, political bias, targeting, and newsfeed manipulation by these companies,"" Westreich said. ""MeWe solves these problems."""
"If this was normal Monday, TWTR would be in 43's or lower."
This is just monday wait till end of month will go to 0
They’re trying to prop this up and it’s obvious
so this chat is censored as well. my post was deleted. How sad. I did not post any lies or hate. just the reason why I deleted my Twitter account.
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out anti-First Amendment censorship. Works for the Chinese.
$50 stock at best...lol

The end of TWITTER has just begun
"I'm noting that the DOW is 30.7K when 4 years ago it was around 19.5K. Let's see if it goes up from here, or down from here the next 4 years."
I am still seeing money rotating out of $FB and $TWTR and into other smaller cap tech stocks.
TWTR also out on google and apple app store
People should not buy from Amazon and apple. Stay away Twitter and Facebook! Don’t use google search!
"Never used Twatter or Facistbook and never will. It's a brainwashing/mindcontrol tool run on people's dopamine receptors. Probably the worst thing for education, IQ, attention spans, and society in general."

"Twitter is the future, Facebook is the past."
We tried to warn ya! Mass migration of illegals from Guatemala and sure to pick up more along the way to the US. Guess what they running from? Socialist government. Maybe they’ll turn back in a few years cause that’s where we headed. Maybe we join them?
sell stock
Bet Twitter don't tweet about todays losses. BUT I will. lol
"feel bad for the investors in Twitter, but this is what Twitter deserves."
Did anyone actually read the company earnings presser where a Q1 loss was forecast?That has been buried.
Twitter to 10 dollars by March. Shorted more!
Every share holders of Twitter and board members should demand Dorsey to step down from his post for his lack of fiduciary duties to share holders . He should be placed in square!
Nobody needs Twatter
Dropping Twitter was the best thing of all. It seems Twitter is a hub or racist activities. Look at how much Twitter triggers violence across the globe. How many times do we need to see law enforcement post things liek we seen in Kentucky where they are the ones triggering racist activities? it is shameful for anyone who works at Twitter and contribute to global anarchy and unrest
the only positive thing about today is it's one less day we have to put up with DEMENTIA boy and kamel toe. gonna be a loooong funny 4 years. unless ;)
Twitter bull shredding shorts. Ha!
If your personal information is hacked through Twitter their is evidence that Twitter will not tell you and your bank accounts and assets are at EXTREME RISK! Do not follow Jack Dorsey into his dark place!
Next $ 40 then $ 37 up to $ 20

Dead bird falling
You think this run is sustainable?? Only by manipulation.
Sold on Friday!
"We don't need twtr or fb, save time for something else"
Back down. Falling. My guess is below the $65.80 it started the day at. Way below that.
"According to the Associated Press, Defense and National Guard officials found that violent rioters coordinated their plans to storm the Capitol Building in part on Twitter, a platform that often silences conservatives under the false pretense of preventing violence."
"Short this stock to hades. It was trading for $22 in March 2020, and frankly that was double what it was worth. I personally don't think it's worth 10c."
"America is also freedom of choice. America you have a choice. I am a Finance guy, but have a minor in law. I was reading about legal challenges TWIT may face. It will be tough, they are a private company. Some one could challenge them and focus on their ""consistency of applying their own policies"". That may have a leg to stand on. Arbitrary deleting and suspending accounts?? If they did it to president because of violence threat OK although I may not agree OK. BUT, letting Iran keep up its post on killing americans (and yahoo police its a fact go look at it) is opening them up for legal challenges. The way to get back at TWIT is to delete your accounts. That's FREEDOM OF CHOICE. DONT USE THEIR SERVICE. That is the most powerful action Americans can take that don't agree. its very simple. Advertisers want return for their $$$. They will drop TWITTER or ask for reduced rates. Twitter earnings will suffer. Stock price will tank. Good luck"
Membership will likely fall as TWTR is not as popular among next generation of users. TWTR seen as grandparents social news.
Bye-Bye Donnie
Darn futures under pressure again this morning. We need what happened to $TWLO yesterday. Down more than 4.5% intraday then up more than 10% after ER. I suppose it could go either way with this strange market that still punishes solid top line and bottom line beat like $NOK and $AKAM. Seems like a beat is no longer sufficient and you have to be in favor like $SNAP and $TWTR to be treated properly after ER these days. I hope the revenue and earnings beat is sufficient to warrant such favortism today.
Coming Up On The Bottom!
Looks like my $60 end of Feb PT was way too conservative. Upgrading to $75 by analyst day. EZ $ brought to you by MAGA short bus insurrectionists!

"Once the stock market bubble bursts, this will be in the pennies. Next quarter's financial report would be awful as tens of millions have left this anti-speech and anti-American company."
The Oppenheimer analyst is going to get a real life economics lesson that you don't simply shrug off the loss of tens of millions of subscribers.
Loving my shorts..
With all this censoring that they are doing they are going to go down quickly. I along with thousands have already terminated our accounts. Users and engagement times have a big effect on stock prices.
Better have your orders in to dump this stock first thing Monday. This thing is going to tank by atleast 30%. I have seen so many people deactivate their accounts. Bye bye AD dollars.

"Ok, this is scary now! I'm out!"
"While the right is suppose to set up shop at the capitals, I haven’t noticed governors calling their dogs off. All the while they’re planning through Twitter and fb to show up with a decent likelihood of violence. Both groups are equally freaked and the dems can’t figure that out. Nor will the media ask who they are."

"Social Media Technology is very bad and harmful for society. It's like a drug addition. Life was much better without it. Time to ban all social media companies, and we can use conventional / traditional methods of communications and addiction free normal peaceful lives. We do not need social media."
How big of failures are democrats? 2 impeachment attempts and nothing but hundreds of millions in taxpayer expense. I guess liberals don’t pay taxes.
At what price will the Board of Directors and investors ask Jack to step down as CEO/Chairman?
Private Company my ars. So why is it Publicly traded with government subsidies? This company will not be able to handle the tsunami of lawsuits coming in.
I guess NIO is down 7% and NVdA is down 3% because parler is back up and Twitter has fewer users.
And how are our little Twitter snowflakes holdin’ up during the Twitter rout.

TWTR will be buried forever and rest in peace. Parler coming back .
Let those who support censorship support this stock. As for me --- I'm outta here.
This will be their last decent quarter this year
Only way to cripple the monopoly of big tech is to impose 75% taxes on their profits. Good for America. Well Bernie can do that I guess.
Well done Jack and welcome to the party!

Back to the important topic short this to 10.00
Dorsey must have taken a fresh hit off of the meth pipe before making the decision to censoring free speech
Nice moves this week $ENPH $QS $CHWY $PYPL $DDD $TWTR were a few of my best performers. $GBTC is Rock'n'Roll!! Looking for a big move north for $PLTR when it reports before the bell Tueday. Not priced for perfection. A weak pocket to be taken advantage. $RKT perhaps the best value in the entire market. Enjoy the weekend. Buy $PLTR after hours. Premarket on Tuesday may be a little late.
Give it time.

"This country is going to have an ex military and maybe active military problem.. It's already started as several of those in the capitol building are highly trained highly decorated US Military... They took an oath to the constitution and the constitution was not followed with those states changing their election rules/laws.. Even Democrats understand that a rejection rate dropping from 3% to under .5% is not a trustworthy result.. With the number of mailed in ballots, the rejection rate would be UP not Down.."

Twitter keeps losing money and that matters...when the bubble bursts
"Oppenheimer’s Jason Helfstein’s statement that he’s not concerned about the decision to silence Trump shows his ignorance—or possible deception (i.e., should he be attempting to exit under cover of an upgrade). Dorsey risked disenfranchising roughly half of the US market, when the future of Twitter—a company that has yet to prove it’s staying power—is in question. Does anyone really feel that TWTR is important or necessary? Trump might have seen it as important once—but who else other than a boatload of forgettable self-absorbed people trying to make themselves relevant?"
"Twit CEO asked for this, now he's getting it. I only had a few hundred shares, but sold them all."

"After hours Large Block trades.16:57:36 50,561 shares at $45.1817:26:56 5,106 shares at $45.2717:57:19 2,100 shares at $45.2517:50:58 2,000 shares at $45.2617:39:16 5,954 shares at $45.2518:42:22 224,362 shares at $45.18 THIS IS IS A WHALE LEAVING.The after hours volume was 1,030,533 either BOOKED or TRADED, There is a big difference between the two.The large blocks booked in after hours of a 1000 or more is 290,000 shares, I saw lots of 1000 trades and even more 999 to 100 shares booked or traded.Here is the kicker about half of the after hour volume was for 6 to 1 shares booked.As I said in an earlier post when you see 1 to 10 shares being traded in real time or booked in after hours, these are Funds/Institutions or Market Makers and maybe a combination of the three to keep a Stock Price from TANKING.In the case of TWTR 76% OF THE COMPANY is OWNED BY INSTITUTIONS, with VANGUARD being its LARGEST OWNER of Shares.These FUNDS are about to lose there Clients monies big time on TWTR and the fund managers who did not keep their eye on the ball here will be held accountable, if they do so and get away with it they would tar and feather Jack Dorsey at the moment.How FUND managers see Jack Dorsey at the moment is of LITTLE CONCERN to JACK DORSEY, Because 44 year old JACK see's himself a CRUSADER, Against pretty much everything those Fund Managers Stand for.If anything Jack fancies himself a modern day CHE' GUEVARA, with a nose ring."
"Parler will be back, and Twittwr is toast."
"Fellow patriots, please send your own message to Nestle, the biggest Twitter advertiser."

"If you don’t stand up to these companies soon , it will not matter , they will restrict everyone ! Cancel them, before they cancel YOU !"

Honest question other than just saying Twitter will tank. Best strike prices for puts seeing as earning are feb 9th? Puts will print
Some companies you just enjoy seeing fail. And this is one of them. Facebook will be another. No tech company is bigger than America itself.
This is what you get when you censor more than half of America.Believe it or not...... We are the silent majority!
You think it's bad now.....Wait until HARRIS PICKS CORTEZ AS HER NEW VICE PRESIDENT......

Anyone who would invest in a company that eliminates free speech is not an American

"I read that Dorsey is selling off, he knows the end is near."
Gosh. Do ya think it's a bubble?

"soros & gang are supporting the stock, part of the deal"
TWTR is today's Tokyo Rose. An incredible source for forms of propaganda. Opinion without truth or verification. Amazing they are allowed to operate as they do.
"In all the years I have been investing, I have never shorted any stock. But I may want to very soon. Im thinking Twitter and Facebook are both losing subscribers now. And when Parler comes back on line at the end of the month, many more subscribers are likely going to leave those two jokes of ""social platforms""..."
"While this is tanking today bite on this ., EPS is -1.58. This is a shell of company for one purpose, propaganda. It will vanish sooner than later as its mission is complete. The Commies will take their money and run looking for new world order in another corner of the planet."
Looks like that tweeter bird got knocked out of the nest today
"Not a huge drop like I expected, but wait until they release their quarterly numbers and have to reveal the. Umber of subscriber/users they last for the quarter. The day of reckoning is still coming. There’s still lots of room to go down before you can say the bad news is already built into the stock price."

Watch for a flood of shareholder lawsuits against Twitter as the stock price continues to drop. The reason for the decrease is executive mismanagement.

"Companies that don't want to have the rug pulled out from under them by political motivated scoundrels like Amazon Web Services should build and manage their own web servers so that Amazon, Microsoft and other left wing democrat CEOs can't destroy the company by cancelling web services.

Twitter forgot about independent swing voters - lost them too not just MAGA supporter
"The money I'm making on my puts will be used to buy real companies, with real products and actual profit margins"
"Imagine the irony that it takes the Democrats, the political party of slavery to bring back segregation and try to make it cool again. I’d say unbelievable but it’s far to easy to believe unfortunately. They’ll give liberals a protected social media and space to converse online and then grant conservatives permission to go recreate our own, separate platforms from scratch. WAKE UP PEOPLE."

"Tomorrow is the beginning of the end for the stock market, economy, and our country, Democrats will destroy it all, it won't happen in 1 day, 1 week, or even 1 year but will slowly do so over time, and the ones that will suffer the most are the young people who will be burdened with the enormous trillions of dollars of debt and a hopeless future for our country with the Democrat rule and their policies! Was just watching the video of Summer Breeze by Seals and Crofts on Youtube from 1972, takes me back to simpler times of the 70's when the world was a much nicer place to live in and life was less complicated and so much better, so glad I lived through those times, these poor young people of today...they'll never know!"

Twitter pumpers are really trying....you’re going to lose more money
More Pump and Dump eh? Project Veritas spilled the beans on what Dorsey is up to. The bottom will fall out of this today.
I believe the current CEO of Twitter has chosen the path that was given to him by more powerful people. He is not actually capable of making these waves of change decisions on his own while spending 90% of his time disconnecting from his worst fear...people.
The value of Twitter has fallen so much that Twitter should settle out of court with Parler and just sign the company over to Parler.
Puts outweigh the calls 3 to 1. Twitter wont see green for awhile...

"80 million Trumpster gone to other platforms. Trumpsters' liberal opposition follow them to the other platforms to harass. So, 75% of TWTR activity gone. The best part is that 4,900 TWTR employees join the homeless on the streets of San Francisco. Trumpsters win in the long run."

Twitter wins again and 45 and Q lose once again by a landslide.
"S&P500 should consider replacing TWTR with another tech stock. TWTR doesn’t add value to the index, price never really went above its IPO price, it’s not growing."

"Short Twtr stock, this company because of its policies is a sinking ship. Let them know censorship in America will not be tolerated."
HIGH VOLUME SELLOFF will continue. Twitter lost of millions of users permanently.
315 million moentizable users sounds very bullish. People buying at 70s are expecting it to reach to $150 in an year or so. So I am not selling a single share.
Who remembers MySpace? What about Friendster? Twitter has passed its apogee and there is no turning back.
Gee I wonder why Jack Dorsey doesn't want regulation and the government to be able to track the $50 million in Bitcoin that Twitter purchased.
This #$%$ is heading below $40 this week

"TWTR is the next MySpace. In case the self righteous Wokers running TWTR doesn't know what that it is. Too bad for you. You're about to learn. Words of advice. Text your parents and ask them to get the basement ready for your return. After all. It's not that hard to put up a website on internet. Just as the internet is new and exciting, in years to come it will also be littered with sad tales of self destruction. TWTR makes nothing. It traffics only in text. Their self importance and societies police is the beginning of the end for them. Facebook too."
Twitter company is under CHINA GOVERNMENT CONTROL Please get out if you don’t want to lose all your money......

"I thought we were about “personal responsibility”, Respect For Others, obeying property rights, and The Constitution here in America? Which one of you is responsible for this one? Seems like all of you at the Grievance Gazette are. He’s white and homeless and I don’t see any of you wealth barons offering him a $15 an hour job to earn his way out of Jack in the Box despair. He says he’s tried 100 job applications. You say he’s a commie and just wants to eat his birds. There’s truth there somewhere. According to the police, James Schulz, 53, entered the restaurant Wednesday night without a face mask. He was requested to wear one to be served or use the drive thru. The customer ""belligerently refused,"" Ratliff said, and accused the restaurant staff of not wanting to serve him because he was homeless.Schulz then walked toward the door, and as the manager turned his back, he allegedly ran behind the manager, tackled him and stabbed him multiple times in the arm and upper torso with what appeared to be a pocketknife, according to Ratliff."

Sell now! Rumor is this will tank very soon! Not a joke
"Amazing! Simply amazing! I have learned that the many conservatives that refuse to leave Twitter are still there for one main purpose. Evangelism. That's it, that's the only reason. It's enemy territory being infiltrated for the cause of Christ. That's the only reason I kept my Facebook account, but I cancelled Twitter (even though it used to be my favorite form of SM). Let's see how long this post lasts?"
twitter revenue is higher than snap. and twitter is profitable the last two quarters. yet snap market cap is almost nearly twice bigger than twitter market cap? whats going on here??

"if you support basic human rights and the first amendment, delete your twitter account NOW"

"every day, the same story. early morning bump, slow decline to 2/4% losses... what an investment."
By June it might drop to $10/share.
TWTR will see $ 20 before seeing $ 50
Twitter CEO took up a short position before announcing Trump ban. No doubt about it.
"Based on Twitter not having all that many users to begin with, they lost millions in America. Under the radar are the millions more overseas who deleted Twitter. With that there’s hardly anything left on the bone yet look at the price. Way too high."
"Can't even sleep, so excited to see the demise in the A.M. #Cancel.Culture.will.pay"

Flush it down

Deactivated. FB too. Amazon next.
"TWTR and FB need to be regulated. We need a law to require every social media account to be verified by a drivers license and the name you use on the account needs to match the license. Also the name needs to be fully public on your profile, comment posts and so on. No more anonymous accounts."
It’s hilarious how the big players are trying to pump this back up. It’s gonna fall hard earnings
"in the 30's next week, way to go jack !!!!"
Unequivocally unamerican to own this stock.
I just joined GAB !
"I just cancelled my $TWTR, $FB accounts. They are communist."

You so-called patriots who keep trying to destroy this pps actually gave me a great entry price of $44.05. Won't get out till $60.
"I see the stock is going up in the pre market, guess people don;t care about free speech, so sad"
Twitter is in the lead at the race to zero. In second place we have facebook followed by Google Apple and Amazon. Its been some race today.
The volume on the March put options with a strike of $20 is increasing. Volume on call options is off the charts. The options are very volatile to the down side for TWTR. People buying this stock long are probably amateurs.
Trump and many others have already filed lawsuits against Twatter. Wait till the lawsuits from ad companies come in. They #$%$ too! They paying all this money with no subscribers. Haha
"TWTR up 54% in one month. Wow, has that 'triggered' the rotgut filth in the GOPQ. Dorsey is laughing all the way to the Bank. Oh, that's right, he owns Square, a digital financial services Company TOO! LMAO"
"It is so nice to have real news without the lies and misinformation, and also real daily briefings from ourexecutive leadership, and also leadership that is about helping people instead of corporations."

"Great job twitter Revenue rose 28% to $1.29 billion, compared with the $1.19 billion average analyst prediction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twitter on Tuesday cited “strong brand advertiser demand in the U.S.” as a driver of ad sales in the fourth quarter, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Net income rose to $222 million, or 27 cents a share. Twitter reported 192 million daily active users, 26% growth from a year earlier but shy of estimates for 193.4 million. Overall for 2020 the company added 40 million new daily users, crediting the gains to both “product improvements” and a series of major events that drew in audiences, including the U.S. presidential election and discussion around the global Covid-19 pandemic. You the the ed man Dorsey"
Why the heck is this stock up in this bear market.
TWTR target 37.50 this week
Timber!!!
Shouldn’t a company loosing money for so long be in bankruptcy ? They are heading for a shutdown. Workers treated poorly. The caw union is coming.
38 cents. Best ever quarter
TWTR will trend down for days and days as more bad news sinks in
"TWTR is a fantasy for longs. The dream will end once Jack comes clean about the exodus that occurred after his company went cuckoo. That said, I had to cover my short at 50 and change, because I'd rather have taken a small loss than get swept away by frothy insanity (look at GME as an example!). I'll probably short again once a top has been established."
"I don't know about shareholders suing but even as a private frim there is arguably many laws broken since it's a publicly traded company violating First Amendment Rights, These actions would be more under the Securities Exchange Commission rule and TWTR could become a candidate for Delisting under the very similar and policy invoked and utilized this week to to delist China Telecom's. But way before delisting TWTR will be trading at $10.00. The other repercussions I'm seeing on Dark Cloud websites are lists of the TWTR Advertisers people who fight for Freedom of Speech have listed and instructed to boycott those consumer products. I think 75 Million to 80 Million people boycotting those products will get those Advertisers to pull their support and advertisements from TWTR by the end of next week."
Watch how the violent crime rate goes up in the next 4 years along with the cost of living.....
I hope social media companies drop like a rock
This stock should be in the range $38-42 like it did right after Q3 earnings!! Q4 earnings are no better than Q3's.
"Twitter is banning more conservatives, and stock is going up. I would expect Twitter to put up a notice that anyone making an account must be follow all Democrat beliefs and swear to never spread the truth."
FLY FLY FLY. is this the next stonk ? my opinion
Say no to communism. word.

I never understood why anyone would have a Twitter account?? Just children like Tommy boy who are juvenile.
todays price does not matter as the quarter numbers even if good are the last ones that even come close to being a profitable company. going forward will be substantially lower and loses even larger.
"They are trying a head fake !!! Short all you can. Write these numbers down :Average Price: 48.531 (50-day) 39.3182 (200-day)Average Volume: 14,589,982 (50-day) 19,237,962 (200-day)Down on above average volume is good if you are short. Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can."
The truth will set you free. Ironic that many who believed the big lie are going to jail.
"Evolution is a funny thing ! Apple ? Facebook , amazon Twitter. Just like the car replaced the horse and buggy these companies eventually will be replaced with something newer , fresh and better .We might see the birth of a conservative Silicone valley"
I remember safely rioting this spring.....then I went to the beach to spread the coronavirus while patronizing local restaurants.What happened to riots where there was no evidence of spreading virus? What has changed?
Shorts exercise your free speech United we all stand . Freedom of speech
"I love TWTR, but at this level it's overextended."
I just don't see the price as anything other than artificially inflated at this point.
This will be the third day in a row that the DOW is down. Is this the beginning of a bear market. Artificially inflated companies like Twitter are going to take a beating.
Millions of patriots deactivated their Twatter accounts.
"what happen if 50 millions account users turn into a class action lawsuit? that will be huge and ... possible these days. I don't own any of TWTR stock and not a fan of Trump but a private company should do business only. If they don't like what Trump does then they need to seek some kind of authority (somewhere and somehow, like Nacny, she is hungry of power, will give a bless if TWTR asks for one!). Why you mess your business with politics. What happen next will be lawsuit dismiss liability protection from social networking company. that will be a big loss for FB and TWTR. Google and Apple will be next too."
Top Bullish Charts | February 2021  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"$100 million buys you the best food, resorts, houses, travel... Since the world is finite, by the time you are up to $20 billion, it's the same stuff. So what do you do when your increasing wealth won't buy better stuff? You switch over to influencing and controlling other humans because everything else is achieved and nothing else matters. You could take a homeless man with a long beard and put him in as CEO of Twitter, and he will quickly become a censoring neocom like the rest of them. Carol Burnette was asked why she didn't mock republicans, and she said ""why would we chase away half of our audience?"" But marx-like censorship offends half of a company's users, the stock price skyrockets. The horse is already out of the barn and the pigs are up and walking on their hind legs. I wouldn't short this stock because that would make logical sense."

You might be a seditionist if:1. You didn't want young americans serving in endless combat for decades overseas2. You wanted America to preserve its manufacturing base and jobs3. You wanted domestic energy independence instead of supporting regimes that persecute gays and trample civil rights4. You wanted low taxes to make domestic business more competitive.5.

You believe it's important to stand with and support one of the few democracies in the middle east.These are the hallmarks of a #$%$ begone you evil insurrectionists.

"It’s really sad to see people have no principles and buying this. For those buying, do you think conservative leaning people will return to the platform? And for those who are elated by the censorship, please go watch the hundreds of Holocaust survivor videos. Listen to the stories of the men who perished while storming the beaches of Normandy. So many people gave their lives so that you can say you don’t want these rights. Learn how countries become communist and socialist. Please go elsewhere and leave this country to those that appreciate its rights."

"The idea at Twitter, one would imagine, is to GAIN users, along with monetizing active ones. What we are seeing unfold before our eyes, is a massive user exit. It reminds me of my AOL stock owning days (I’m showing my age). So many people could not come to grips, including myself, of the massive amount of people that were leaving to find something better.Once stock holders figured it out......"
Twitter suspended the Gateway Pundit account again on Tuesday for another week for violating the “civic integrity” rules.This is a new Orwellian category that allows Twitter to ban any conservative at will.

"TWITTER DESTINY TO $100's I have been telling last week.... this is just the beginning of a rally, so many thing going on for the money from our bluebird. The "" user's monetization is one of the biggest thing in the process. If you sell now chances that you will miss the biggest oppurtunity"

All true Americans should delete their Twitter account tonight. We should not support censorship of anyone.
another green day in Twitter land great job you the man Dorsey
"Well looks like I was wrong about Democrats, Republicans, Conservatives, Liberals, and Conservatives would turn away from suppressing free speech! I could never invest in a company that tries to control free speech."
"Parler spells ""DOOM"" for TWTR. People really don't like TWTR. It was just the only game in town. Only a matter of time. Maybe even today, the worm will turn and the trend will look like an open elevator shaft."
Wait until opening bell. The drop is going to be beautiful!!
"Bubba Clinton says: ""Shorting Twitter is more fun than a weekend on Epstein's island."""
Twitter trending upwards. great job you the man Dorsey
This stock to the moon..Perfect business model!!! who else has a free speech platform with out free speech besides Twitter!! OK maybe fakebook
Now down 3%.........................
"Twitter is simply destined to fail. There is no other way to see it. Whether it be by Dorsey’s own doing, the public protests that are inevitable worldwide, or the simple lack of public support through the course of the next four years. Any way I look at it, it is destined for failure. The most provocative instance is that there are 20-30 hungry better apps ready to take its place."

I was saddened to see Don Jr not getting treatment. He looks very bad in his latest tweet video of guns threatening teachers. Hunter had a loving family who are working with him to treat his addictions. The trunp family is practicing Turner-Don Diaries on their own kid.
Just shorted again..
"Assume TWTR is going to blow a NUT of cash buying stock in order to prop this up short term. Keep on shorting. Its inevitable this communist censorship platform will have no place in America regardless of political persuasion. I have not shorted it yet, but plan on doing so at 49-50"
"This will be the greatest wakeup call for the social media generation. Who cares about TWEATS anyway. I never had a account, never will. Its time to wake up America. The entitled generation and instant gratification era is now over. TWEAT YOU!!!!!"
On paper this stock should be worth zero. They have no viable product. Twitter is just an extension of the Democratic Party propaganda machine. Wake up people. Stock being propped up by desperate traders who are long o nthis dog.
The new stimulus check is Shorting Twitter!
A fad alienating 50% of its consumers. Strong sell.
Faux ratings way down and Twitter's price way up!

Hey Jack
Seems Twitter is underperforming against the markets of the last month.
Sell & profit now or come fly with us to $ 150 plus elevation. You will have a tough time buying back because you cannot buy a cheaper ticket to fly.......... This is destined to happen as I also predicted that Pfe will be the pioner to covid 19 vaccine.... pfe will go up soon
Twitter your days are numbered. Jack you are a biased Company.
"Sell Calls, buy Puts all the way to the bottom."

Bye Jack.
On fox Twitter down big on dropping potus from platform. This is going down big on Monday.
"sold all share and deleted Twitter, Facebook. Feel much better"
Twitter is like a ghost-town now. No one is using it.
My estimate is that Twitter have lost $7.5 Billion since Monday.
friendly advice. who ever is buying around $46.50. its not a support line anymore. it was broke days ago. thus stock will go to $45 very quickly.
Someone tried to paint the tape. Still closed red. Too bad.
The Best 8 Work From Home Stocks To Buy Right Now For details https://youtu.be/KlbdcMnBESo
Head and shoulders formation complete and ready for the massive dump of this #$%$ company on the 1 year chart
I suspect that once the Institutional holders break ranks the decline will be massive. No way this company has any real value.
Next week will be interesting. The gap between Wall Street and Main Street is now so wide something is bound to happen. Very poor job figures are coming in yet major indexes at all-time highs. Tech ads are going to see to people without a job and money? Will be interesting!
Twitter wanted Parler shut down because people were leaving witter by the millions. Not a sustainable model. Now they have angered half of America. Their business model is too easy to copy. They will be gone. Facebook will find that they have a flimsy model too. My company pulled all their advertising out of social media. Toxic environment.

"good squeeze, but it will end, than the sell off, smart ones getting out know"
"The stock opened at 52.31 last Friday. When it opens tomorrow it will be somewhere around 45. That's a loss of around 15% in one week. When will shareholders demand Jack's removal as CEO? Which activist investor wants to buy these shares and a massive discount, oust Jack, and see the shares go to 80?"
What does Dorsey do after Twitter goes under? maybe work as a barista?
TRUMP 2024!!!!!!!!!
"3.5x normal volume with 20 minutes to go, and pushing a 7% drop. I think its safe to say the attack on the 1st hasn't gone over well. That is if you are a liebral and you are fine with limiting others free speech, ideas and beliefs that don't fit your own. The CCP is proud of you."

MMs holding it up to let certain holders out ! After this process takes place kaboom it will drop like a rock
"Once again, no worries, as Twitter is up slightly on very weak volume (less than 50% of its 10 day average}.The next big volume day is fast approaching, and when it comes it will send TWTR into a severe downward spiral."
How is that short working out for you Parler boys?
"What happened with GME,needs to happen to the downside with TWTR."
"Amazon ,Google, Facebook, and Twitter are the Southwestern Bell of the Twenty-First Century; Google controls 89% of the global internet searches. They determine what results you see in an investigation of information. Twitter and Facebook are the platforms that most US politicians use to communicate with their constituents or make a public policy statement.When these companies come together, censor and or determine which people or politicians will have a voice and which will not or taking down a competing platform that should be a concern for every American regardless of political leaning."

$55.......Analyst Actions: MoffettNathanson Upgrades Twitter to Neutral From Sell; Price Target is $55
"Twitter is going to fail, and here's why. What to watch now is how the so-called Tech Giants go to war with one another. Truth is they hate each other and want a slice of the same pie. Social media is a small part of it to Google and Amazon, they are competing for the Cloud market and the AI which is being rolled out to replace your jobs. I have a Masters in Machine Learning/AI, and the plain truth is, that's what Covid is really about. It's blown out of proportion to lay off millions and replace them with IBM Watson and other products. Banks and other are already rolling it out. Meanwhile the battle rages betweem Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud. The war they are fighting between themselves keeps them divided (for now). Twitter is really just a fly on the wall to that lot, and they won't save Twitter."
Market Cap will be cut in half over next 6-12 months. Poor decisions have major consequences
"""Twitter comes under fire over Chinese disinformation on coronavirus"". Imagine TWTR spreads misinformation that the virus originated in the US and was brought to China. Which side is TWTR on?Take a guess? Your guess is as good as mine"

It’s a trap

Millions looking at parler and lin wood. This is lethal information.
"Last trade size 0, something fishy about that."
Buy this stock and you're supporting communism at its finest PERIOD!
"Twitter censors people and ideas, and this is a problem"
Twitter is suspending accounts so they can't delete them and show the world how everybody feels..DELETE Your account
"Just today, you've seen Gen. Austin announce that the Pentagon is shifting its priorities to carry out war against ""climate change."" This treasonous act would de-prioritize America's national defense and instead focus the entire US military on an imaginary enemy that's nothing but a quack science hoax."
Look at all that republican integrity pulling the stock down lol. Don’t worry they will tell you it lost 50 points tonight on Newsmax lol
Ouch! Down again today. Looks like Parler is picking up a few million accounts. Twittledee is now going to start to charge for their service. This might be a good time to get that resume updated if you work for this Left Wing Rag!

Anyone owning shares of this terrorist anti free speech operation is an enemy of democratic principles and should be dealt with harshly.
"I'm calling hogwash on Jack Dorsey's statements this morning. He is pulling the wool over the eyes of his willing accomplices in the media, investment houses and political realm, but not on those of us that have seen the light! Okay, here's the problem. He's making a killing over at Square, because he had the foresight to get invested bigly in Bitcoin! That's keeping him afloat for now. And making me second guess my short position, for now! I may just hold it and add to it if the price rises 10-20% on the claims that censoring free speech and millions of conservatives leaving his platform don't matter to the bottom line. If you believe that, I have 20,000 bitcoin to sell you at 40k!"
Get out on this dead cat bounce. This stock has been dead money forever and now it is going to be a portfolio destroyer if you buy
Where do you get the report? I am on their financial web page. So far nothing new posted.
"Welcome to Twitter! Uh... Yahoo! Finance Twitter public stock forum... where you can still share you opinions freely, and @Jack cannot do a dang thing about it. In fact, all those people he kicked off of Twitter platform are now coming here to air out their grievances. Personally speaking, I quit posting on Nov 3 and then deactivated a few days ago. Reason being... I don't participate on platforms that are corrupt and try to brazenly manipulate and subvert the minds of the masses. @Jack did it, and now he is paying the price. And I've heard the one thing they hate is to have someone like me or you share our opinion publicly when it makes them look bad. Oh, the irony!!!"
maybe the dems can get sprint and Verizon to suspend services to people they dislike as well?
Lol you know there’s an issue when they write an article saying twitter soars and it goes up 2 bucks and change lmao 
I Just Bought $40k+ in #BitcoinSV BSV & #DogeCoin DOGE! [Buy The Crypto Bloodbath] #Cryptocurrency#YouTube Link >> https://youtu.be/69l-xZJHwm4
massive exodus from the platform...do the math
Users leaving TWTR is only just beginning. Millions have left already - but that's just the beginning. Not many advertisers will want to waste money on this sinking ship. Those that do will only do so because the decision makers for those companies are as far left wing as Dorsey. Wasting company money to advertise just to support someone else's political stance will not sit too well with those companies and heads will roll. This ship is sinking - and it's not alone.
Hopefully these shorts keep averaging up and angering the market makers so that way we can continue this beautiful squeeze ride. Here's to all the stubborn shorts out there. Thank you
Been holding Twitter for over 5 years. Seen everything bad and good. But not selling.. Go Twitter! Finally free trumpster gone!!! Great 
"I didn't even know what Parler was until a couple days ago, and shock to see the monopolistic big Tech TWTR, APPLE, AMAZON banded together to bully and shut down a small company. This is outrageous!"

"This stock price is suddenly pumped by political reasons, not by performance merit. It should be around $40."
"Democrats are not good at business. They are good at corrupted business, but not free market fair and ethical business. The tech oligarchs should focus on BUSINESS and not politics. No good will come of social media and internet businesses focusing on politics instead of business. Let congress in the USA handle politics. Let the people decide how they are governed. Business leaders should stick to BUSINESS."
Watch this stock grow like anything on earning date.
This is short lived.......TWTR is going down the tubes. It's being propped up until big guys can get their money out........then watch
I wonder why Bezos would even care. He’s worth 182 billion. Why would he care if workers at one of those distribution centers want to unionize and drive wages up? That’s American. Higher wages for workers is American. Unions are American. American is Union strong.

"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."

80% of time I did not agree with Trump but to have TWTR remove the US president from the platform is a disgrace. Founding fathers made sure all citizens have the right to free speech. It is called the US constitution Mr Dorsey. This is a dark moment in our history. Conservatives need to create their own platform. I also say time to break down big business such as AMZN. They did it to Standard Oil. AMZN should be next

TWTR becomes a stale echo chamber in long run. Not the best time to own social media.
Ask yourself after twitter becomes all democrats who are they going to argue with. Most people would get on there to argue. The amount of time spent on twitter will go down for even democrats.

"Twitter is already losing more than 80M conservative and libertarian users in the US, maybe they can find new users in the big market of China... oh wait..."
I really think Jack Goebbels Dorsey is getting tired of Twatter. You can tell the distractions it's causing him from keeping focused on grooming his beard and nose rings. I look for him to end up selling Twatter for anyone who takes it once it dives to the $5-$10/share region.
Amazing this turkey is still gobbling. Within the next 48 hours you will see it necessary to cook and put it on the table with all the condiments.
there's nothing political about this stock.but reading the conversations is like attending a WWE tournament in San Francisco. Oy vey!TWTR stronger than ever before. Let's go!

Twitter is better off being at $30 without Donald than at $50 with him. This same logic applies to our country as well.

Worst case he can buy the web services from a chinese company if all they American companies wont sell web services to him to shutdown conservative speech.

Leftists investing in Twitter stocks.
Jack has to go. Democrats don't control free speech.
"Twitter always had a problem monetizing their service which is why the stock really never went anywhere and I agree with Jim that it wasn't smart to ban the biggest draw they had, I'm sure thier share holders appreciate that Jack thought of being a moral cop before he thought of his share holders, that can be the end of a company because the decision making at the top has the wrong priorities for the share holders, he may feel better but his company may now die, their are competitors that will rise that allow free speech."
I personally don't care to take sides on the election or any other topic folks are going on about. But when a company takes away the freedom of speech ALL Americans are affected. What they did is basically Communistic censorship. It cannot be tolerated by any American as we ALL will suffer. These are difficult times that I hope we get through quickly but Twitter has done nothing but divide us further. I have cancelled by account and I truly hope they fail. This cannot be tolerated at any level.
"Stock quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good"

"Social media platform Twitter has locked the accounts of both Project Veritas and James O’Keefe following a recent report relating to Facebook’s VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen.

"There’s about to be some BIG CHANGES coming down the pike for not only Twitter but $FB as well. These online platforms, along with others, have PROFITED off of the ad revenue generated for the spread of MISINFORMATION among Americans that has caused HATE AND DIVISION within our country. They’re platforms are being used as tools to organize MASS RIOTS all over the US. I’ve been against FB and Twitter from the very beginning. It was obvious to me what would come of all of this and in my opinion these “social” media sites need to be SHUTDOWN. There is very little, if anything, “social” about them."

"Isn’t it remarkable how after the Capitol was attacked Democrats found their moral compasses on criminality. When our businesses were burned & looted throughout the Summer Democrats were silent. When Police were attacked everyday killed and injured they were silent. When BLM injured dozens of Secret Service outside the White House Democrats were silent When the President had to be secured in the WH bunker silence again. They were silent when every statue was pulled down Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln not matter they were silent. The media encouraged violence, with CNN & MSNBC reporting as mobs looted, and fires burning in the background they were peacefully protest. Only when polls started to show their numbers dropping did they in a loud whisper say they were against violence. What happened at the Capitol we all agree was wrong. But how easily a man dressed as a furry and the rest of the rioters made as far as they did must be answered. The Capitol Police were warned, along with the DC Mayor the day before by the FBI. But the Mayor refused to activate the National Guard. Now 21,000 Guard are surrounding DC. Ask yourself why?"
Parlor is going to buy Twitter at the bankruptcy sale.
"To be all honest what do you charge King Neptune with his spear standing in the halls of the Capital with? When compared to the Looters we saw in all major cities over the summer who got charged with nothing but got away with $billions in small business owners inventory? I think if you add the lives lost over the summer tied to the RIOTS. Police lost like 25 members and the damage done in those cities maybe as high as $700 Billion. I do think TWTR leaving the IRAN President's TWTR site active over the President of the Free World is a joke. It's why the Capital Markets will show TWTR what Freedom of Speech means in the U.S.A. Right or Wrong , Democrat or Republican Freedom of Speech will not be controlled by Social Networks in the U.S.A. Those who try to control it, well look at the close of trading on Friday for TWTR!"

TWTR is one of the most undervalued tech companies in today’s market. A lot of loss-making low growth companies are trading far more expensive than Twitter

They have to censor and control the Narrative they are the minority. a Reckoning is Coming
"The war is over. Twitter does not realize it yet. Telegram has won hands down in users, interactions, functionality and the all important 'free speech'. BE VERY CAREFUL with Twitter either way, it is just a MANIPULATION stock now. Not much intrinsic value. Read the earnings report, where are all the tough questions and FY21 goodies? SOFTBALL."

Jack Dorsey spotted on a Amish farm in hiding
Good point by one of the posters. The support will come from horrifics who support the socialist/marxist/globalist cabal. Won't last long as there are more of us than them.
If you disagree with Twitter and Facebook censoring opposing views dump your accounts. Don’t reward them for taking away your rights.
almost 8% down... HA HA..

You know the billions in balance sheet cash Dorsey is throwing into TWTR to support its price? That cash is going to be depleted when the next quarterly report release (not this one). Slow and painful spiral to the OTC market.

Dorsey needs to be removed if this company has any chance to survive.
Anybody see the vid of the NG turning their back on the Pedo selects Motorcade? the reason we are being censored is because they greatly outnumbered and are desperately trying to control the Narrative to cover for their Treson
"This will be like AOL and Netscape... Get out while you can. To my conservative allies, we don’t need to do everything at once. If we show one tech company at a time - this time, Twitter - and create our own platforms, counterparts to the other mainstream platforms will come about. A multi-millionaire or billionaire would be silly not to cater to conservative minded people for those platforms. They’d literally make a BOAT load. Will it take a while...? Sure, but, as with the story with the tortoise and the hare, we learn that slow and steady wins the race..."
TWTR down over 3x the naz. Ouch!
"Trumpsters lost the election, their attempt to steal the election, their relevance to public discourse, and their little red hats which the dog chewed up. But hey, TWTR is down a few percentage points!"
If this is going up bc investors think Twitter will make more money by charging are NOT on Twitter reading the responses to this idea. Hint: It's going over like a lead balloon.

Would it not surprise you if Dorsey was in Portland with Black umbrella in one hand and a molotov cocktail in the other
"Why do radicals on the left always accuse others of what they are doing ? Is it a learned behavior or a natural instinct to deflect when you don't have a valid argument ? Also remember when democrats said daca kids shouldn't be held responsible for the crimes of their parents, but then they turn around and blame all white people for 17th century slave owners? What is with all the cognitive dissonance in this country ? Could it have something to do with twtr, FB, and msm disinfo campaign ?"
"Let's be real...Tweety Bird, FB and the like will always be popular apps and stocks. Please sell so as can buy the Dip!!"

"So twatter shut down MonkeyWerx and MajorPatriot's accounts. What those two guys did was #$%$t factual objective information on the voting irregularities in Georgia and identified antifa members with photo's of them at antifa rallies and then they were wearing Trump gear and were in the front lines breaking into the capital building last week, photo's and streaming vid confirmed it. So for presenting the truth their accounts were suspended. Dump this #$%$ stock because the cash burn they are going to go through paying attorneys to defend them in 2021 is going to be significant. Oh yeah and they are a socialist run anti-free speech so called company as well."
"Twitter is the top most active stock because they’re being sold. It’s really because people had higher expectation for Twitter than FB Amazon we already know those are corrupt, we just did t know Twitter would follow."

This thing will go to 0.000

Told ya Twitter was gonna romp you shorts. And great to see MARJ on the street corner.
Twitter’s future is not looking too bright. The creepy CEO has moved onto other business ventures—Investors should too.
"TWTR business model is too political and too risky to exist! It’s not only tanking this time! It’ll literally disappearing faster than we expect! That’s why Jack Dorsey keeps asking others to take over and uses SQ as an excuse to leave! Yes, he knew it! What a rare shorting opportunity! "
Stay SHORT!
this pump is money managers pumping it so they can collect profits in the next two weeks its heading down massively in two weeks mark my words. they shorted the entire market for two weeks now and theyre trying to lure fomo chasers in here so they can exit out with profits on this ticker. this is gonna run sideways like nvidia or tdoc after march MARK THIS POST
I know TWTR is down at the moment. Look for a spike today above $50. This is a great entry point after the mild pullback from what will become irrelevant news... GLTA

"Let me just put it this way: Jeff Bezos did Jack Dorsey a favor last night by shutting down Parler. But, what they don't get, is that we're not coming back. Having nothing is better than being a patron customer of a tyrant media platform that deems whatever it wants unacceptable and kicks it out of the public forum. And, hey Jack, you can check my Twitter account. I really did deactivate it! And, Parler or not, I'm not coming back."
I am looking to reach 65 to 68 in my short!

"There was very few and little attention paid to the months of riots and violence all summer from the left. No interest at all. Now democratic law makers describe what happened last week as a Coup d'état. If this was an attempted Coup d'état, they should take some lessons from the rioters in Oregon. Taking selfie’s while you protest doesn’t seem the way to go."
predictions after earnings report? have at it
Big money bringing you in saying safe and cheap. Then the shorts will drop the hammer as institutional investors bail out. Be smart. Twit deleted millions of accounts. They will not come back. A generation gone. You think there is a future? It’s over. It will now be an echo chamber of movie stars doing selfies and politicians talking to nobody who believes them. The party is over and Jack doesn’t care about the investors only about his handlers. CHINA ￼￼
I already deleted my account.
Jack Dorsey for man of the year!He silenced the orange overload!
apparently companies don't care about stock value. and more about politics. This should be grounds for delisting if they do not work as exclusively to be more profitable and grow. NOT minimize growth.

Only Twitter picks the day off a major market reversal to rally. I hate this stock.
"I would like to see Twitter Fall dramatically. But, the money managers are not going to allow it to day. It is an expiration day for options; weekly options. I think Twitter will stay level. Because it is being Artificially been held up."
Big uptick! Up 8.8% $65.18 Ride the Wave!

Never seen such blatant pump or is it insider news?
Fly Birdie Fly! Tweet Tweet Baby;)
Twitter should go back to what it does best - telling the world about the cute thing your cat just did.
Lets get this down past $40 by close. 20$ by the end of the week. Twitter cant sustain itself on just koolaid hair socialists.

I quit using twitter and faceboowk-now my data is harder to congregate and analyze-it's harder to pinpoint what kind of consumer I amI don't have to see people I barely know - bragging about how great they are.I don't have to get the political opinions of people I don't know

Analyst try to upgrade the stock so institutional investors can unload, so when the stock goes up on less than average volume is good, short more. Big clients can push the stock up in order to unload their positions. This will be below 39.31 very very soon, if you can short ....short all you can."

Trunp claims total control of the GQP. There we have it. Cult.
The Industrial Revolution happened with almost play by play mirror image as this big tech revolution is happening. In the history of the industrial revolution 100% of the leaders of that circumstance are now considered evil men. Supporters of Twitter are very short sighted.

Half of twitters revenue and followers came from Trumps and conservatives. Ouch that's gonna hurt.
wow
Losing today $$ Again Jack ?? LMAO Bankrupt Soon
Frightened rightwingers who want to overturn elections in order to install an orange monarch have no idea how improved the twitter platform has become minus the treason. Of course the valuation is on the rise.

CrazyI dropped FB and Twitter and I find myself doing more productive things! Sad how addictive I was to them!
"TWTR, No profit, no dividend, no Federal Income Taxes paid. Declining mDAUs and growing competition. So, again, I should invest in this company because........."
Whoever is buying this stock is throwing their money away. $30 by their earnings. Almost a 50% drop in a month. It will keep dropping from there.
How do you unify with a communist?

Done with Twitter. These social media companies just went down a rabbit hole from which there is no escape.
"Twatter is just completing the chart formation of a classic head and shoulders move, once that right shoulder is formed it will tank massively"
Any American company that is against free speech should drummed out of America and your stock should be worth no more than 2 cents a share. Next up is Amazon and Google. I have reduced all my business dealings with them as of today and will have all associates follow. Remember 75 million customers don't agree with the Socialist Communist agenda the Democrats are putting into effect.

"JIM COLLINS Jan 15, 2021 | 11:45 AM ESTStocks quotes in this article: TWTRAfter Thursday's column, I feel it is the right time to delineate my case against Twitter (TWTR) . So much of what I read in the financial media (not on Twitter, as I deactivated my account last week) on stocks is subjective, numbers-free blather, and in fact quite useless. So I have made it clear that Twitter is awful AND awfully overvalued, but let's focus on the second part.How about a little actual financial analysis to bolster an opinion on a stock? Trust me, it feels good, almost as good as deleting your Twitter account!First, we start with revenues. I am limited in space in this column, so won't have time to delve into Twitter's profitability metrics, but we live in a world where tech companies are valued based multiples of ""revs,"" so I will stick with that. The key to any analysis of financial statements is disaggregation.For Twitter we start -- and finish -- with the one metric given by management: mDAUs, or monetizable daily active users. Twitter changed to this metric in February 2019, and, in and of itself, it is meaningless. But it is a good base for modeling. Twitter's recent quarterly report showed 187 million mDAUs with 36 million users in the U.S., and 152 million abroad. I am assuming the difference is due to rounding.That's where Jack Dorsey's ship will start to sink. Twitter -- and every social media company -- receives a strong valuation based on user base figures that are full of people who don't actually use the service, but do have an account. But with this latest movement -- of which I am glad to be a part -- folks are deactivating their Twitter accounts, not just ignoring them.Those user numbers are going to plummet. I would expect this to happen when first-quarter figures are reported in April, not as much when full-year results are reported Feb. 9. How low can they go? Well Twitter's mDAU base is small to begin with, so that the initial drop-off will be quite noticeable.It is the international figure that is more difficult to divine. Twitter's public affairs division Thursday astoundingly criticized the government of Uganda for restricting social media to prevent interference in an upcoming election (didn't Twitter just do that, repeatedly, here in the U.S.?) but the fact of the matter is that there are governments around the world that are authoritarian. Twitter has never been available in mainland China, for instance.On a real user basis, I would expect Twitter usage to fall by about 50% here in the U.S., and for the service to be banned in some other countries, and for the others to fall in line with the U.S.'s decline. That gets you to 36*.5 + 50*0 (the banned) and 102 *.5 (the non-banned internationals.) That leaves you with a real user base of 69 million for Twitter. Of course they will twist the numbers to appear better using mDAUs IOUs, PDQs, or whatever new metric they can concoct. On Twitter's reported figures the revenue per mDAU (best to use a rolling four-quarter figure for revenues to produce an annualized number) was $18.11 in the third quarter, which is astounding. Obviously no one would ever pay to use Twitter, and I was unaware that advertisers were interested in the global demographics. Extract that figure -- that's aggressive, by the way, the r/u will fall as the user base falls -- and apply it to our real user base figure of 69 million, and you get a real, annualized revenues figure of $1.25 billion for Twitter. This contrasts with the full-year figure of $3.46 billion in 2019 and my estimate for 2020 revenue at Twitter of $3.25 billion. This company was already shrinking...but now the dam will burst, in my view.Even after this week's pullback, TWTR shares, inexplicably, were trading at slightly above 10x trailing revenues as of Thursday's close. But, using our ""true"" revenue estimate of $1.25 billion, we derive a fair value for TWTR of $15.63. This ignores the fact that TWTR had over $7 billion of cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, and valuation is as much an art as a science, but I am just doing a back of the envelope here.So, there's your math. Last Friday TWTR closed at $51. This Thursday It closed at $45. My fair value implies that it should be worth $16.That is a short. Regardless of what you think of the company's management, and I think I have made my opinions abundantly clear, TWTR shares are just plain overvalued. Bet against them as you are deactivating your account. It will feel good!"
Good bye Jack.

"As some point, we all need to realize that as a country we are better than what Twitter is representing. There are many great companies to trade and make nice money on like the EV stocks.

"Can someone explain why anyone should own Twitter stock not trade but own. With a 45 BILLION dollar market Cap, 2% inside ownership (who sell every time they convert their cheap options), loosing money hand over fist, loosing users even faster. The only way Vanguard, Morgan, and Block Rock can get out is on a sale and I assure you no one is paying these prices. I expect a rise in 4th quarter top line numbers with increased losses based on higher over head and a huge legal bill. I also expect first quarter will be dismal at best and their cash position to be dwindling. I think eventually this trade back to the 52 week lows of $20 per share. If I'm wrong so be it but I would like to here a bullish reason to own TWTR."
It will be 50% down after next earnings.

I am most concerned with the forward looking statements ... hard to buy when the business almost guarantees a loss AND slower user growth. What do you think?
"The brand new Birdwatch program is doomed to fail as people will not want their posts ""cancelled"" by incredibly biased left-wing radials. This new policy will only motivate millions of conservatives to leave Twitter. The blue bird has been injured in recent weeks and is desperately trying to save itself from a financial catastrophe. Too little, too late."
So a company whose business model is based on letting people express their opinions has decided to engage in all-out censorship. Makes sense.

"I think this whole big tech mess has actually been a good thing. I have gone to small businesses and pro freedom of speech companies to buy my goods and services now. When using Amazon you are paying Jeff Bozo when you could be buying directly from the seller and saving money and supporting small businesses directly. I am enjoying finding new online sites and small shops in my area. I have found EVERYTHING online that I had with Amazon. When I deleted my Amazon account there was a subscription box that I gave up, but I found it online direct from the company. I guess I just assumed you had to go through Amazon to get a lot of the things I had bought off of Amazon. I am having a grand time finding new places to get my goods so this has actually been a good thing. The only thing I am still missing is Parler. I hope they come back! There isn't another social media site online like them that I can find yet. I liked the whole design of their site and all the many people I met on there. I have Gab and ChatDit and Rumble and I don't miss Youtube. I am SORRY though for all the creators on there that are losing money by people deleting their accounts or not watching YouTube. I hope all my favorite creators move to Rumble or the other free speech video sites and I can find them soon."

"Somebody knows something. This stock is defying earnings, guidance, logic, and other backlash over the past month, and that only happens when Wallstreet knows something non-public. After seeing the Microsoft/Pinterest news, I'm highly suspicious of possible twitter acquisition/interest by a big player."
Twitter up and Faux News ratings down. Lou Dobbs canned.

"""Hit the road, Jack. And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more...."""
Twitter is overrated as a communication platform
Janney Montgomery broker told me many investors buying the put contracts. Just saying
Goin to Zero....
"Bottom line -existing user accounts are plummeting. User growth also plummeting. Loss of users = less TWTR makes on AD revenue . Institutions have fiduciary responsibilities, and this stock has become a risk."
This dip is not buyable.
Sell this 
"TWITTER IS THE RISING STAR OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ERA, with so many new prodject that can really be USEFUL & PROFITABLE in 2021 and coming years to come. Come fly with us to $150 plus feet elevation, while the ticket is still cheaper... ticket will surprice with the hefty raise in price"
"I uninstalled the app from my phone. Frankly, I don't need it. I don't think Dorsey actually cares about the share price."
Tomorrow below $60
"Let this kommunist TWTR falls. TWTR, FB can ban and block our freedom of speech. TWTR, FB block all news unfavorable to their masters. Now TWTR cried Uganda blocked it. TWTR can ban and block others, but others cannot ban and block TWTR. That's free speech according to TWTR."

"Those McCoys in Georgia! After spending 15 minutes spreading untruths, GQP teacher Susan McCoy learned her kids are smarter than she is. They recorded her spreading lies. And now she’s in real hot water. As with all CONS, she’s amazing apologetic after being caught in video. I’m sure she is. No amount of tweets will fix it. Tweet lady tweet. They never are when the cameras aren’t rolling, but as all GQP Cons are learning : THE CAMERAS are always rolling. And we have 5 years of them on video. And now we are locking them up. LOCK HER UP. Spreading purposeful disinformation to a child should be a felony for every offense. Every time. Every occasion. And the result should be loss of license and censure, public shaming, and for the most egregious cases, public execution. If the right white are going to practice their Saudi charia here to punish the citizenry, our LISTS will find them All. I won’t be part of the chabad infiltration"
Sell on strength. Next earnings release TWTR is going to get crushed on DAU numbers dropping.
Why is this tanking? Lol
"BIg news. Twitter buys Revue giving authors/posters a way to monetize their audience on Twitter. This has been something needed for a long time. Now that people can make money on Twitter, expect higher user engagement and more people pushing their online audiences to Twitter. Get out now shorts, while you still have your shirts."

"Liberals - when you read this board, notice the seriousness in the tone of what’s going on here? Who’s side are you going to be on?"
Don't be tricked into buying at this price by Jack. You will lose money when the market opens. Opening red.
SELL this if you believe in freedom of speech.
"""Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one’s thought and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They know its power. Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reason of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come in their presence.""-- Frederick Douglas"
This is a $20 stock.
This is going up for no reason
Regardless of them actually being publishers how can anyone invest in a stock that is run by Jack.

"Ditch Twitter. Ditch Google. Ditch Facebook. BUT ESPECIALLY GOOGLE/YOUTUBE. If you must watch Youtube make sure you have adblock on so you they don't get any advertising revenue from pumping ads at you every 5 minutes. Ditch AT&T if you can, that's Google/Youtube again."
"So many emotional, broke bums who think they got it all figured out Twitter is headed to the moon"
I say the company sells all the assets and goes out of business and redistributes all proceeds to the American people.
This company just threw away half of it's customer base.THATS NOT GOOD BUSINESS!

"Oath Keepers lost their twitter accounts. Head nut, Thomas Caldwell, is in front of a Judge today. And no, he can't carry his AR-15 in Court. He's looking at 20 years. Doesn't look good for the O.K.'s long term employment in the free world."
"Look at where the stock was before 2016, and look at where the stock was after 2016. I don't see this company as a buy. strong sell."

But if he can do it, then fine. Just don't get caught holding this when the market closes..."

"after 6 years of agony I sold Twtr at 60.50 and bagged 123,800.00 after hrs trading."
"It took this stock 5 years and so many earnings to go from $14s to the $40s, with ignorance and rare praise from analysts. Then suddenly in 10 days it got all the analyst blessings and jumped from 40s to 70s with no extraordinary achievement. Manipulated political pumping!!"

"I can't wait to see the TWTR bloodbath on Mon. The stock was already overpriced, and the market is way overdue for a correction, esp. tech stocks. The Twitter employees who urged this censorous action will be paying in their retirment accounts. Karma."
"You can't get the people back once they walk away. Twitter is being propped up for now, but the stock is collapsing."

"Heading over to parlou-r to get important updates and announcements. Nope just vitriol and hate Heading over to gab to get important announcements and updates. No, just junkHeading over for telegram to hear about weather updates and important local bulletins. Oh, no not hereTwitter has all these things. And responses from local people adding critical information. I guess that’s why it’s publicly traded and well and used by every outlet to broadcast critical information. If you have a steamy barf filled story, maybe one of the Wests can lend you some channel time."

Top Conservative Leader Tom Fitton Is Still Suspended by Twitter 7 Days After a 7 Day Suspension for Tweeting the Truth on HCQ
I wonder if snuckerburg loan twit bitter some cash from all the shares he has been selling. They are probably trying to stabilize the downward spiral.
Stock keeps going up even though right-wingers encourage people to cancel their accounts. That makes me hopeful.
"Saw a job post the other day: $10-12 an hour. Bachelors degree and 3-5 years experience required. To work at a coffee shop. I’m thinking there’s a disconnect if people are going to be asked to have a degree to work the point of sale. It makes Twitter marketing and only fans look more lucrative. If you’re going to buy a house, you can’t do it with some gop offering you $10 an hour for a register job. Minimum wage at $20,000. If rent is 600, and food is 200 a week, you’re out of money."
Booom short depressed
"RIP twitter, it was fun while it lasted."
"Easy pre-market manipulation, great to make a couple points per day short."

"TWTR and FB are ""chosen"" spying platforms.Avoid!"
Dive !!! Dive !!! just like a submarine...
it was a $15 stock before we have this great president in the office. we'll be there again soon.
Which side would Twitter have chosen in the Revolutionary War? Would it have mattered?
"Congrats to all longs for holding strong. Glad to see the boycott cult have only made this stronger. Have to admit, I was a little nervous, but clearly they are not the ones using Twitter. Twitter is a lot more peaceful now "

"I just got suspended by Youtube for expressing my opinions which someone flagged for review and didn't like. Have been with them for many years and nothing like this ever happened. Didn't post any outright ""hateful"" things just the truth in a polite manner. Maybe it's a good thing because I may have been spending too much time posting on their site. Have cancelled my Facebook account many years ago because I came to the conclusion that I don't need to ""friend"" people just for the sake of ""friending"" people. I like my privacy and have no desire to re-connect with people from my past and give day by day reports as to what I'm doing with my life. Was never on Twitter at all and have no intention to being on there."
"How many insurrectionists did the 25,000 National Guardsmen have to put down during St Joe's inaugural event?"
"When social media companies limit free speech, then the smart thing is to stop using them! Just go back to using your phone and actually call someone and talk. You get to hear their voice and laugh with them and it's much more fun and personal. Ditch these companies that want to limit free speech and control the flow of ideas and thought that they disagree with. At this rate we dont have to worry about the Russians or the Chinese meddling in our personal affairs, you've got these multibillion social media companies that are doing a much better job at it!!"
