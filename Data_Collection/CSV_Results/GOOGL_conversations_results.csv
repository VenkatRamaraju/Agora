"I already own a bunch of googl , and I would love to add to my position, but I will only add below 1000.00. I think I have a decent chance of be able to do that"
"GOOG needs to beat by at least $5 and change to match todays share price. I'm still holding strong, but concerned about other stocks and the market(s) being toppy. What do you all think!"
"...At least 20 analysts raised their price targets on Alphabet shares following the report, according to FactSet, and the average target now stands at $1,596.94, about 11% below Monday's close. Of the 47 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Alphabet, 42 rate the stock a buy and the other five rate it a hold."
"My 20 year old nephew is a YouTube vlogger who makes about $2500/month from his business. He's been vlogging since 16 & has been steadily growing his business. His younger brother who's 15, has a strong passion for fitness & nutrition as he's a competitive athlete. Seeing the success of his brother's business he now wants to get into the vlogging space. He propositioned his brother to give him a $2500 loan to get him started which he agreed to. With the passion they have for their respective interests & the continued learning they'll undergo in the process I don't see why they won't be financially successful by the time both are in their late 20s. I say this because people say there's no value in this company when one of it's platforms are creating successful entrepreneurs daily. This is a long term play & I'm in for it."
What happened to Google Finance? Was a pretty informative web page for monitoring stocks especially comps and sectors was right on the search page.The current page does not compare favorably.Anyone knows?.

"Alphabet (GOOGL) price target rasied to $2,000 from $1725 at Baird, OutperformBaird analyst Colin Sebastian raised the firm's price target on Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to $2,000 from $1,725 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The company benefited from ""strong"" e-commerce trends through much of the holiday shopping season and there is improving visibility for digital advertising in 2021, Sebastian tells investors in a research note, citing positive end-of-year channel checks. Alphabet also faces easier year-over-year comparisons next year, and should benefit from an expected recovery in travel, recreation and automotive ads, says the analyst. He sees a ""favorable outlook for 2021."" Further, Sebastian does not expect ""game changing"" penalties to be put on the company from regulation. His valuation analysis against Apple (AAPL) indicates Alphabet could be worth $3,000 per share longer term."
"My broker bought me 5 shares ....... 5 not 50 not 500 not 5000 and I’m up $1,100.00 in 3 months"
stop fooling yourselves Google is what it is because it makes superior products. the search is their bread and butter and it is far and away better than Bing imho. Google Maps and YouTube are monumental human achievements and will continue to dominate for years to come. I'm not a fanboy but a satisfied user amongst BILLIONS! Buy and Hold!

"All GOOG employees just received their new party uniforms today. A lovely shade of brown with matching shirts, embroidered eagles on the breast pockets and nifty lightning bolts on the collars. ACHTUNG!"
This is as cheap as it gets. Seldom will you see a multiple this low in a company that's changing the world. Buy modestly here and become an Alphabet millionaire in 20 years.
"Serious question - not judging but more of a curious research question. Assuming we loosen restrictions on going out, who is going to a restaurant, airplane, retail store, concerts, sports events etc? What places will you still avoid until we get a vaccine? Who is and will change their spending in the next 3, 6 , 12 months? They keep speaking about fundamental changes to society and more people working from home but my thought is that as humans we like/need interaction and going out. We can't live our lives inside via the internet all the time. Such a dynamic shift to our way of life. Like many of you I'm trying to envision how we will live our lives going forward and with that try to focus my investments."

GOOG falls on concerns on spending AMZN sky rockets on spending what an Irony.
"After hours means nothing! Tomorrow while it may open lower , it will then turnaround and resume its upward momentum."
Green becomes GOOG.
Aww yee only stock currently green in my portfolio up 0.1 percent and holding strong... Wut up wut up
Google on the way to 1250 this week.
Well that was quite a 15 min swing...
Big miss Cheryl!!! Thanks for the heads up!!!
"$1,505.23 coming!!!!"
Green already! Squeeze the shorts
Frustrating
Missed earnings revenue but GOOG still goes up like usual. Nice ha!
Looks like Google has been a very bad bad boy lately. I think a 10% drop is in order!
"Google Finalizes Chelsea Market Buyout, EXPANDS- NY Business March 21, 2018 (Zacks)Per Reuters, Alphabet’s Inc. GOOGL division Google finalized the purchase of New York-based Chelsea Market from Jamestown LP, an Atlanta-based real estate and asset management company, for $2.4 billion.The deal, announced in early February 2018, is likely to strengthen Google’s footprint in New York and will expand its business. The deal provides the company with the ownership rights of a huge office building. Reportedly, it is the second most expensive purchase of a single building in the history of New York.Chelsea Market, formerly known as Nabisco Cookie factory, is a 1.19-million square foot complex adjacent to the Google’s New York headquarter. The building has a shopping mall and a food court which is the center of attraction for most of the local visitors and tourists.The food hall will continue to operate and will be managed by Jamestown.Coming to the share price movement, the shares of Google have returned 28.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 17.7%."
Place your bets.
"I don’t know everyone’s negativity towards Google, and I don’t have large money like most do to buy 50-100 shares of Google. But I bought five and believe a 5 year hold will be a nice little reward. I don’t see Google falling off if that’s what people are thinking. I believe FB is going to go under before Google does. I don’t understand all the hype over a social media company."
Let's see bag holders people
What a great opportunity to buy shares on the cheap
Biggest thing since Alphabet started breaking out subsidiary performance in their financial reports. WAYMO will show the sum of ALPHABET parts will be greater than the whole. So much research and development has been plowed into WAYMO. Now we see how they're going to make it pay off.
"I am a GOOG long for 10+ years. I sold my options and I have to take the tax impact. I am concerned about the valuation. The earnings growth is 15-16%. GOOG can no longer claim a PE of 25. At the PE of 20, GOOG needs to earn 50 dollars this year to justify this 1150 type of value. I do not see that. Even if GOOG earns 50 dollars next year, the earnings growth may slow down even more. I do not see the stock go up much unless there is a way GOOG can squeeze the margin. GOOG grew from 800 to 1150 in a year. But the earnings growth slowed down 25 to 20 to 15. So the current valuation is too high."
Hey Yahoo: where do you get the yearly targets from? Many stocks have already surpassed your figures a year out. You can do better.
"""Googleheads "" thumbs up if you wantTo hire people for their abilities and skills,Versus diversity and political correctness.Maybe then google stocks will grow faster."
"Clearly a good company gone bad (GOOG). Change is inevitable, I hope our own futures see superior upside. Long in basic stocks."
"I'm expecting blowout earnings, hoping they'll do a FB on this.. Gl to all longs."
Holding since $500!!!
someone on here said this is the same setup from just before the March crash. I now see that it is exactly identical. Going short now! Good luck to everyone
SNAP is the preview of what is to come for GOOGL. Advertisers came back more than expected. SNAP has a fraction of the advertising that GOOGL delivers. Prepare for GOOGL to finally catch up with the other FANG stocks. GOOGL after hours movement confirms this sympathetic trade.
Great super bowl add
"GOOG has shown tremendous resilience recently, so this breakout is exactly what I was expecting. I'd argue that GOOG is the best of the best mega-cap stock, atm and going forward for some time."
Very nice! close over 50 days 100 days and 200 days moving average.
"Time to pay NLST!! Settle, buy NLST, or you can have a jury decide damages and drag this out. Either way, Google must pay."
Well the new Dem supermajority will probably tax the heck out of this stock.
"GOOGL did not hold the 100 days moving average, if it does not hold the 50 days moving average of about $175.60, it will drop to $1050 before earnings"
TWTR has no earnings and is worth 50 Billion Dollars.Google must then be worth $3 trillion dollars.Join the crusade to reach the pot of gold with Google.
Congrats to all long!!!!!!!
"The earnings and revenue beat estimates. Yes the stock is down after hours but like others have said, wait for the call."
"Google going to rise because of apple, fang and other tech avoided a hold in the road for this week"
"So, who thinks there is still room to move here?"
gonna be lots of profit taking off this huge after hours boom good luck everyone!!
"Based on Googl’s price now, it appears a downgrade might have been more helpful."
"Today I sold me Netflix shares with minor losses. I’m afraid this company is done. There will be more and more pressure from other streaming services (incl $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPL, $HULU, $GOOGL and other service). $NFLX is burning a lot of cash and the only strength they have is the number of subscribers which will decrease with the increase of competition/alternatives. More, today (the next day after Disney released their new streaming cheap service with great library!), Netflix announced increase of price [face palm]- I got an email. Last but not least, mostly, Netflix’s library of content is garbage - I have nothing to watch there. So, I do not see bright future for this company, but good luck to all those who are long here"
"2025 PT is a high of $10k ...a mean of $8.5k and a low of $7k....where's the downside...firmly holding 75 shares at $$1800 and change...Oh, and there will be another split. At least 3 to 1 and possibly as many #$%$ to 1."
GOOG Longs ....
When it goes bad they blame trump
This Pi...g is going back to 1150
Why is GOOG crashing when it beats earnings?
Supreme Court rules in Google’s favor in copyright dispute with Oracle over Android software.That's why GOOGL soared today. That was a $9B suit. Headed to $2500 fast and with solid YouTube/ YouTube TV and search numbers combined with rapidly recovering travel industry GOOGL should see $3k in the next year. Split? Anything is possible.
option traders either made a killing or lost their souls with this guy today
Cover your shorts! LOL
That feeling when you just wish you can wake up all over again
"I wish you guys would not take the tweets from the orange man seriously. IE, the market should ignore this dude, as just that - a reality TV star. Android is Linux, Linux is open source. “Asian” smartphone vendors dont make overnight decisions based on tweets, believe me, no real business owner in this world makes decisions based on 45th tweets. Relax and play your Own cards, no need to react to Noise from the 45th. Long live GOOG!"
Hope they talk more abt Waymo during the call!
"Charlie Munger in Annual Meeting a few years ago:""Google has sharks in their moat""Now the country gets to decide if sharks are legal or not!"
The reason I bought Google is because they are a monopoly. There is nothing bad with it. Just like goverments have monopolies over taxes. Or are we going to split up goverments too?
Rumble sued Google this morning. Google is too big and needs to be broken up.
SWEEETT! Massive beat! Google has not run up as much as other tech stocks. Now let's start running GOOG!
"This is very bad news for big tech. Just like Google is shut out of China, Russia and other countries, the EU will most likely follow suite and why not. They can skew search results to help EU companies and protect their privacy laws and security. This is bound to be a pattern around the world, country by country. Other big tech are just as vulnerable for the same reasons. Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, they are all at risk."
It deserves a P/e of 25 due to it's low risk profile and has growth besides it's size but a p/e of 30 is on the overvalued side
"10-year was below 1% on Jan 1st, now over 1.5% just 2 months later, a 50% increase. With rates heading quickly to 2%, how low could GOOG stock price fall?"
"it's sad to see while AMZN and others recovered GOOG(L) keeps struggling down... well, or hold or sell... decisions, decisions..."
I had to add this to my portfolio after the 8% drop. Glad I did.
told you $1300..
New York Times said Q2 digital advertisement revenue down 50% so far. I think Google has similar decline in ads. Companies are cutting cost. And ad seems inappropriate unless you can link to help people in Covid 19 crisis.
Great report! Much better than excepted wow
What are the chances of Google advertising investigation reopened by FTC ??
Netlist shares may become google shares soon I’ll have about 400 easy
150 billion cash is not efficient use of capital! Google board needs to announce a major buyback of stock and dividend!Time to do your jobs and return capital in a meaningful way!
The stock market really stucks. Sell and put your money in real estate. They aren't making more land!
"“One of our great companies, Google.”"
Heading back to $900 Fast
TECH IS DONE!
Some upward momentum on higher volume
This may open big in GREEN tomorrow. The -300 futures reversal has came back and Europe/Asia markets in green.
Doesn't matter if it miss or not. It will correct itself either way.
buying at 1098
"watch at Google I/O 2018, it's simply the most innovative company out there. I just bought 50 shares. It's simply too cheap in comparison with Amazon and Netflix."
"Morgan Stanley says market closer to recognizing Alphabet sum-of-the-parts value of $2800Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak argues that Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are the only two ""mega-cap"" tech companies not trading on some version of a sum-of-the-the parts valuation methodology with Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) ""all having moved in this direction."" However, he also believes the market is getting closer to the ""appreciating and realizing"" this value at Alphabet and thinks that continued YouTube revenue disclosure and upcoming full Google Cloud segment disclosure should help investors better understand and value Alphabet's underlying drivers. The analyst, who said his updated sum-of-the-parts analysis ""speaks to how disclosure could drive Alphabet towards"" being valued at $2,800 per share, keeps an Overweight rating and $2,050 price target on the stock."
The sharpest tooth in the FAANG! My fav - GOOG saves the market for at least another quarter! Stay long - can’t wait for AMZN!
IMO - Buying opportunity on dips. This will go to $1 Trillion market cap this year.
"$GOOG Expecting a drop after earnings, all-time high, needs significant growth in cloud biz to go to $1300. I'd be buying Puts /Put Spreads"
"After what I read about GOOG on (http://Experttrade.uno) the other day, I’m starting to think about opening a position."
Australia is tip of iceberg.....many governments will be finding a way to tax Google as politically acceptable way to raise funds to pay for stimulus......charging for news effectively moves income into their tax jurisdiction.....after holding Goog for many years I think far more downside risk from regulation across countries.
Should lift markets tomorrow
when is google earning date
GOOGL likely to close at the Low point of the day. And that is positive indication to believe that it will go up after market results.
"Google vs Oracle at the supreme court, this decision went the way it needed to, otherwise the entire industry would have gone KABOOM!!!!"
I think the FACEBOOK effect will AFFECT them in future quarters...
"India opens antitrust case against Google over its payments appIndia’s antitrust watchdog has opened an investigation into Google for allegedly abusing the dominant position of its app store to promote its payments service in the world’s second largest internet market.In its Monday announcement (PDF) about opening an antitrust case against Google, Indian watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it would review claims of whether the Android maker prominently promotes Google Pay during the setup of an Android smartphone (and whether phone vendors have a choice to avoid this); and if Play Store’s billing system is designed “to the disadvantage of both i.e. apps facilitating payment through UPI, as well as users.”The informant, who has not been identified, alleged that in addition to Google Play Store’s billing system favoring Google Pay app, in-app purchases for apps downloaded through Play Store are also mandated to support Google Pay service “if they want to be listed on the Play Store” and they are required to pay a “high commission” for that.The informant also alleged that Google “unfairly” skews the search results on the Play Store in favor of Google Pay app over others — though CCI is not investigating this claim citing not enough evidence to support them. Google “rigs its feature app lists such as ‘Editor’s Choice Apps’, ‘User Choice Apps’ and ‘Top Free apps’ … demonstrating clear bias in favor of its own app; by manipulating the search advertisements algorithm on the Play Store in favour of Google Pay.”“The informant pointed out similarities between the conducts of Apple in Europe and Google in India i.e. like Apple (as set out in the Press Release of EC), as a mandatory requirement for listing on the Play Store, Google requires the app developers to exclusively use Google Play Store’s payment system and Google Play In-App Billing for charging users who purchase apps on the Play Store or buy goods/services from inside an app (i.e. IAP), and further like Apple, Google charges app developers a 30% commission for allowing them to use the Play Store’s payment system and Google Play In-App Billing,” the Indian watchdog said, which has directed its director general to complete the investigation within 60 days."
$Nlst Netlist (NLST) patent was stolen 12 years ago by Google after they signed an NDA to look at Netlists memory patent. Then Google promptly bootlegged it through a chinese manufacturer screwing Netlist a California company. Google thought they could bankrupt Netlist but CEO fought back for 12 years and won a final victory against Google June 15 2020 when the Federal Circuit Appeals Court upheld the Patent Trial & Appeals Board claims against Google namely 78 claims with a rule 36 unanimous decision. Google exhausted all appeals and in 30 days approximately the USPTO will issue the new patent upholding all 78 claims. Stay against Google will be lifted for a jury trial with treble damages if they don't settle. Please consider investing. Do your DD and understand this is a seminal patent that propelled Google to the forefront of searches with stolen Tech. Its time for Google to pay. Damage award should be in the many $Billions.
never bet against GOOG and MSFT .two stalwarts of the world economy

Google Accounts tied to personal email address = BADWhy are you letting Google track you through your personal email address? Only use burner emails for search from now on
This grasshopper wanted to initiate a position in the high $900's. Might not be happening any time soon. Train left the station.
So much for anti-trust fears...tech always wins...they are the future
Better buy Netlist... Much more potential...https://wallstreetwindow.com/2020/07/shares-of-small-cap-stock-netlist-otcmkts-nlst-simply-go-up-again-today-mike-swanson-07-06-2020/
bought the morning dip and up very nicely today still more runway back to $2400+
Large investor - sold Google and will never own again
The stock market is making fools of many......it has got to go down right?.....Apparently it'll do what it wants....Google is no worse or better off than it was 6 months ago.......the fundamentals haven't changed. I've got more cash on hand if I can get in cheaper than my $1100 average.
"Was all set to load on a few share around $1,200.00, I read most of the report. Did I miss something?"

"Google is a great company, duh"
"You guys just ain't see nothing yet. FB just shines out of the dark side, but GOOG will make you even more surprise next Monday. GOOG is so steady and improving every single quarter. This year will be GOOG's year."
Back up the truck! Sale day! $$$$$
Is there anything that Google won't steal?? Seems the company is built on stolen technology just to start the list.
"GOOG will shine this quarter, You Tube scores big time and dominates the whole world. The surprising items will be the other revenue will jump up big time. It comes from the hardware and Pixel, don't be surprise that Google Home and speakers will get big number because consumer survey shows that Google products beat AMZN's products by a mile. The earnings growth rate will be in the high 20s and revenue growth will be in the 30s. Look like GOOG is undervalue at this price, plus the Jay Powell knew he committed the mistake and China's tariff issue starts to shine positive for the whole economy for the US. The positive plus are Google's Map, Chrome Cast beats Apple's TV and the next new toy will be the GOOGLE WATCH, which I think AAPL is rattling in the boots."
"everyone whining about GOOGL should go to other fang stocks or hot tech stocks like semis. This is no longer seen as a robust growth story by many investors, it's a company with massive amounts of consistent income. While some look for growth, some recognize the value of this stock"
Analysts reactions - Susquehanna actually raises target from 1340 to 1500; Stifel goes to a hold from buy; Instinet cuts to1300 from 1310; JP Morgan cuts to 1325 from 1350; Oppenheimer cuts to 1342 from 1435; Morgan Stanley cuts to 1425 from 1500 maintains buy rating.

Big news coming our way. Heard googles about to release a crypto currency running there search platform huge
"Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL) is trying to compete with Amazon’s (AMZN) business in several ways. If it’s not trying to poach buyers of cloud computing services from Amazon, then it’s trying to dent Amazon’s e-commerce dominance.With the support of Google, traditional retailers such as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are making more online sales, with their online sales having grown 33% and 28% year-over-year, respectively, in the latest quarter.￼Google’s threat to Amazon’s e-commerce business is growing. According to the latest research reports by Canalys and Strategy Analytics, Google’s star is rising rapidly in the smart speaker market.Google overtook Amazon in the smart speaker marketEstimates by Strategy Analytics show that Google shipped 2.4 million smart speakers and more than doubled its share of the global smart speaker market to 26.5% in the first quarter. In contrast, Amazon doubled its smart speaker shipments, but its share of the market nearly halved to 43.6% from 81.8% a year earlier.On its part, Canalys estimates that Google beat Amazon to become the world’s top smart speaker company in the first quarter, as we can see in the chart above. Google’s rise can partly be attributed to retailers prioritizing its speakers over Amazon’s because retailers view Amazon as a competitor."
Smoking it after hours. Anything to do with proposed increase to AI spend?
"78 % of Americans use Google at least one time a day, and it has become a necessity. Up 230% the last 5 years.....Buy it!"
Google Cloud has been taking a beating by AMZN & MSFT. Google Fiber flopped and Waymo is losing huge amount of money like Lyft. Not good.
"Does anyone know why GOOG has been priced slightly higher than GOOGL lately? GOOGL has the voting rights and has, until recently, been priced a bit higher than GOOG, but now it's the other way around. Why would shares that have an extra perk (albeit, insignificant for most shareholders) be priced less than the shares without it? Just curious if anyone can shed light on this."

"Inside the Google-Facebook Ad Deal at the Heart of a Price-Fixing LawsuitLawmakers have called for an investigation into the tech giants’ contract, dubbed ‘Jedi Blue,’ which allegedly allowed for auction riggingGoogle allegedly gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a lawsuit brought by 10 Republican state attorneys general saysState attorneys general said in a lawsuit earlier this month that a 2018 business agreement between two digital advertising giants, Facebook Inc. and Google, was an illegal price-fixing deal. Lawmakers are calling for further investigation. The companies say it was above board.The Wall Street Journal viewed part of a recent unredacted draft version of the lawsuit, which elaborates on allegations in the redacted complaint filed in a Texas federal district court.Ten Republican attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say Google gave Facebook special terms and access to its ad server, a ubiquitous tool for allocating advertising space across the web. This and other conduct by Google, they allege in the final lawsuit, harms competition and deprives “advertisers, publishers and consumers of improved quality, greater transparency, increased output and/or lower prices.”Crucial to the backdrop of the Google-Facebook deal was the advertising industry’s movement toward an ad-sales method called header bidding.Header bidding helped website publishers circumvent Google’s exchanges for buying and selling ads across the web. The exchange auctions ad space to the highest bidder during the split second it takes a webpage to load.Header bidding allowed the publishers to directly solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges at once, leading to more favorable prices for publishers. Google worried a big rival might embrace header bidding, such as the Facebook Audience Network ad service, or FAN, cracking Google’s profitable monopoly over ad tools, the states allege. “Need to fight off the existential threat posed by header bidding and FAN,” Google advertising executive Chris LaSala wrote in an internal document outlining 2017 priorities, according to the draft complaint.In March 2017, Facebook publicly endorsed header bidding. Google approached Facebook and in September 2018 reached the digital advertising agreement, the states allege. The draft lawsuit says Google code-named it “Jedi Blue.” In December 2018, Facebook announced it was joining an advertising program, “Open Bidding,” that Google offers as an alternative to header bidding.TERMS OF THE ‘JEDI BLUE’ CONTRACTThese are some of the alleged stipulations in the Google-Facebook contract, according to a recent, unredacted draft of the states’ lawsuit viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Google says it is common to match users through trackers known as cookies, and it publicly offers that service to other buyers. • Facebook pays Google a 5% to 10% transaction fee. (Google says this fee is standard.) • Google helps Facebook recognize mobile and web users. • Facebook bids to show ads to 90% of users it recognizes. • Facebook has 300 millisecond “timeout” to recognize user and bid. Some other participants have shorter, 160 millisecond timeout. • Facebook is locked into spending $500 million annually starting in the fourth year.In return, the states allege in the final suit, Google gave Facebook special treatment. Among other things, it allowed Facebook to send bids directly into Google’s widely used software, known as an ad server, the draft lawsuit says.Typically, bidders go through an exchange, which sends the winner on to Google’s server. By circumventing the middleman, Facebook could face less competition and save money. Google barred Facebook from discussing pricing terms publicly, the draft says.Google also told Facebook which ad opportunities were likely produced by bots rather than by consumers, and it didn’t charge Facebook for those impressions, according to the draft suit. Other auction participants asked Google for the same information but were denied it, the final lawsuit says, redacting the information in question.Any bidder without that information would be at a disadvantage, said Adam Heimlich, CEO of ad technology company Chalice Custom Algorithms LLC. “It’s like saying CarMax has the ability to tell when they have a junky used car, and they don’t tell you,” he said. Mr. Heimlich accused Google of harming competition at a Senate hearing this year.Unlike other types of antitrust cases, which can require complex market analysis and the sussing out of business motivations, agreements to fix prices or rig auctions are inherently illegal, said Harry First, a New York University antitrust law professor who was once the head of New York state’s antitrust enforcement bureau.“The only defense that a court will hear is, ‘We didn’t do it,’ ” he said."

"While these GOOGL haters continue to post their moral reasons for not liking GOOGL and eagerly thumbs downing bullish comments like mine, I continue to buy shares here, because the stock is cheap at these levels, has an astronomical cash reserve, huge cash flows, and an unquestionable moat. So while the haters will continue telling you not to buy and trick you into missing out on massive financial gains, I say to buy hand over fist here. The stock price will go higher and higher despite the moral objections of so many who post on here. I never let my morals dictate what I invest in unless of course the company commits fraud, something GOOGL has not done. So thumbs down at will haters and bring on the insults...it's not gonna make you any richer unlike me."

"Australia to introduce landmark Google, Facebook legislation to parliament next weekCANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia will introduce landmark legislation to force Alphabet's Google and Facebook to pay publishers and broadcasters for content next week, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday.Australia is on course to become the first country to require Facebook and Google to pay for news content, legislation that is being closely watched around the world.“The bill will now be considered by the parliament from the week commencing 15 February 2021,"" Frydenberg said in an emailed statement.With bipartisan support, the legislation - which Google says is ""unworkable"" and will force it to pull out of the country altogether - could come into law this month.The acceleration of the bill came as a senate committee examining the proposals recommended no amendments.Representatives for Google and Facebook did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.The U.S. search and social media giants have pressed Australia to soften the legislation, with senior executives from both companies holding talks with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Frydenberg."

"Microsoft says U.S. should copy Australian law targeting Google and Facebook over news contentMicrosoft likes Australia’s plan to make Google and Facebook pay local publishers for content included in search results or news feeds so much that the company thinks the U.S. should adopt similar thinking.“The United States should not object to a creative Australian proposal that strengthens democracy by requiring tech companies to support a free press. It should copy it instead,” Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.Microsoft waded into the dispute down under earlier this month, when Google threatened to block its search engine in Australia over the proposed law, or “news media bargaining code,” as it’s called. Smith said at the time that Microsoft would never make such a threat.Facebook has also warned that it would consider blocking Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law passes.Smith used the occasion in his post to dive deeper on threats to democracy and journalism and the erosion of traditional news sources at the hands of the internet and social media. Microsoft also touted its MSN licensing agreements with 1,200 publishers worldwide, generating $1 billion in revenue for those publishers since 2014.“The legislation will redress the economic imbalance between technology and journalism by mandating negotiations between these tech gatekeepers and independent news organizations,” Smith said. “The goal is to provide the news organizations with compensation for the benefit derived by tech gatekeepers from the inclusion of news content on their platforms.”"
"I have decided not to trade this stock and will hold on for the earnings report. I believe in the near term for a +10% upside (target $1200). Just think about all the Alphabet products you use every single day (I can count 5-6 products) - making them pass the ""toothbrush test""."

"With the Google EXECS loudly verbalizing assurances of Taking Down Trump for the next election, assuring he doesn't win again, they are sealing their own fate. The Boeing Company leadership approach is silence and support of the President (even though we know that may not be their true beliefs), yet silence gets rewarded. The Boeing stock price has been on the rebound rise despite all their negative MAX 737 news. In reality, Google is outperforming BA in actual Growth, EPS, and Revenues, yet because the Google leadership team is so vocal against Trump and now against other politicans, they are holding down their own stock price and assuring a breakup. Foolish indeed - Google management Just SHUT UP, be SILENT. Disclosure: currently long both GOOG and BA"
This would make a nice class action by all users of Google against the company: for fraud in representing it is a pure search engine when they secretly manipulate search results.
No other company can weather inflation better than Alphabet.

"GOOG cash is one of the reasons the stock is still cheap. GOOG is supposed to earn 41 dollars. At 25 PE (reasonable for a company grow 20-25%) it should be worth 1025. Because of the cash it should be valued close to 1200. Also there is a good chance GOOG will exceed these numbers. So at 1100 GOOG is still cheap. if you look at 2019 earnings of almost 50 dollars (plus 200 dollars cash per stock), its cheap. 2019 GOOG valuation should be 50x25+200 = 1450. Say it will go at a discount. So we are looking at a price of 1250-1300 in Jan 2019 and 1400+ in Dec 2019"
This is a $1250 stock pretending to be a $1000 stock.

"No One will ever buy Alphabet again. It is obvious they have missed earnings so bad, they should just declare bankruptcy. BTW, I got in Google when it was a little over 300 per share before they split and made GoogL and Goog. This overreaction melodrama is absolutely incredulous. Yesterday, before the announcement of earnings, immediately at closing bells, the seller stood up and crashed the stock. There was no doubt as we witnessed that, the fix was in. Look at how many billions just disappeared from the market cap over this. Google is basically debt free compared to the others like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. All carrying huge debt. Yep, overreaction and theft happened yesterday at the closing bell."
needs to drop about another 400 for fair value
"Buying GOOG, FB and BA today"
"Getting cheap again. 4Q earnings will be very impressive. Political spending this season blew away expectations and you know Google got a big share of the spend. Google is going to be a $2,000 stock."
Thinking of buying now because it’s pretty low to what it will/should be by the end of the week.
"Google should buy SWIR, the leader in the Internet of Things, IMO. Before Apple or someone else does."
"Microsoft (85 Billion) Apple (114 Billion) Amazon (49 Billion) carry big debt. On the other hand, Alphabet (4 billion) and Facebook (500 Million) do not. Debt matters."
"Google's like real estate, buy it when it's low and hold it for 10 or 20 years see what happens."
Getting over $1066 (50 days moving average) and $1088 (100 days moving average) is a big challenge.
IQ a better deal.
What if they announce a split in earnings conference
"A prediction: Before the end of the current administration ends, Google, Facebook, YouTube and Yahoo will be broken up—or the CCP will have a firm hold on our country."

BUY CRSP now
"The so called “smart city” Quayside project, a partnership between Google’s Sidewalk Labs and the city of Toronto, has come under increasing scrutiny amid concerns over privacy and data harvesting. duh"
"If we end the day at any price over $1,060 per share, then I'm a happy camper. $1,060 is a key support. It has held since May of this year. When GOOGL fell below this in after-hours and the pre-market, buying kicked in to regain that support. And we were even briefly in the green today. If we close below 1,060 for a couple of days, then we have a serious technical breakdown. I'm less worried about Google at this point in time. I'm more worried about Apple. If Apple performs well post earnings, you'll see Google and other tech rise in concert, and Google will easily make back today's losses. If Apple disappoints, then prepare for tech stock Armageddon."
Trump supporter here...but he’s wrong on this one. There is more negativity written about him by the MEDIA. Google would have to filter data in his favor to affect searches...and THAT would be wrong. $1B lawsuit. Who cares...with $110B in revenue. This is a money making machine.
"Australia rebukes Google for blocking local contentThe Australian government has urged Google to focus on paying for Australian content instead of blocking it.After media reports said Australian news websites were not showing up in searches, Google confirmed it was blocking the sites for a small number of users.The search engine said it was conducting experiments to determine the value of its service to Australian news outlets.Google, Facebook and other tech companies are fighting the Australian government over plans to make them pay for news content.Google said the tests affect about 1% of Australian users, and will be finished by February.“The digital giants should focus on paying for original content, not blocking it. That’s my message to those digital giants,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.The big tech firms have been resisting legislation which will force them to negotiate with Australian news outlets over payment for the content which appears on their platforms.If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide for them.The law is currently being debated by Australia’s Senate, and is expected to be voted on early this year.Google and Facebook have called the rules unfair and suggested they would force them to limit their offerings in the country.The bill also covers Australia's two public broadcasters ABC and SBS, and requires Google and Facebook to share user data of news stories with their publishers.“That is a world-leading scheme that we are putting in place. It has been acknowledged not just by regulatory agencies but by other governments around the world,” said Mr Frydenberg.Google argues that its search services would be worse under the change.It has rolled out an extensive advertising campaign in Australia, arguing the laws would be damaging.Australia’s media proprietors see things differently. Australian print media has seen a 75% decline in advertising revenue since 2005, the government said.Many Australian news outlets have shut down or cut jobs in recent years as a result."

Any guesses for GOOGL's price a week before the earnings (on July 23rd) and a couple of weeks after the ER?My guess is it will be close to $1200 before and then $1250 2 weeks after ER.Remember GOOGL was $1186 or so in the past 6 months.

"Wow what a great day to buy, give it a week or two folks once things with China and the privacy policy come to a better standing. No one really wants Google to disappear but Amazon, Google runs mostly all the fiber optic networks and controls the set language of the internet. Google is a beast with ads too, the ads may be less targeted in the future to track cookies and follow you around the internet, etc. Fb heated up too, will also bounce back.

Google search revenue might have declined, but YouTube ad revenue climbed 6%. Alphabet's cloud computing business, too, although nowhere near as big as some of its rivals', got 43% bigger in the quarter.Meanwhile, despite the GAAP profits drop, with operating cash rising and capital spending falling, Google generated a stellar $8.6 billion in positive free cash flow in the quarter -- 23% ahead of reported net income and up 32% year over year.Trading at roughly 32 times trailing free cash flow right now, Alphabet stock might not be cheap, but it's still an immensely cash-profitable enterprise, and it is growing its cash strongly."
It would have been nice if they do 1-5 split
"Overall, this was a very good quarter with solid beats across most key metrics."
I think we need to replace the analyst that can't predict right. Missing the EPS by 2. and overstating revenue by 300M. That is an analyst problem not a Google miss.
today is only the beginning Google can easily go to 1450
No one wants amc or GameStop or Nokia we are on the google board a reputable company that actaully makes money!

"What Biden means for Big Tech—and Google in particularTechnology policy is not a priority for the president-elect, but the government's lawsuit against Google will continue.Throughout his campaign to win the White House, president-elect Joe Biden has been relatively quiet about the technology industry. In a revealing January 2020 interview with The New York Times editorial board, Biden said that he wanted to revoke Section 230; suggested that he disagreed with how friendly the Obama administration became with Silicon Valley; and referred to tech executives as “little creeps” who displayed an “overwhelming arrogance.” But internet companies have also been one of his campaign’s top 10 donors, technology industry insiders joined his campaign, and incoming vice president Kamala Harris has long-standing ties to Silicon Valley as the former district attorney in San Francisco. Aside from expanding Broadband access, and its role in climate change and the coronavirus response, however, technology may not be high on Biden’s list of priorities, says Gigi Sohn, who served as counselor to Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler during the Obama Administration.Biden suggested that he disagreed with how friendly the Obama administration became with Silicon Valley… but internet companies have been one of his campaign’s top donors.She says he’s going to inherit other major issues that will—and should—take up his administration’s early focus. “We could talk about the evils of the internet, but you still need it,” she says. “I think making sure that every American has access to affordable broadband is more important [than regulating the Internet], because they need that to live right now...to work...to learn...and to see a doctor.”On Sunday morning, less than 24 hours after the first network called the presidential election for Joe Biden, the president-elect had published a transition website detailing his administration’s agenda. It had four priority areas: covid-19, economic recovery, racial equity, and climate change. Technology was mentioned briefly, but with a focus on expanding broadband internet, rather than regulation of Big Tech companies. So what will tech regulation look like under a Biden presidency? It’s not clear, but there are several areas worth paying attention to. The Google lawsuit will continueIn late October, the Department of Justice filed its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Google. While experts are divided on the strength of the lawsuit itself, they agree that it will continue under a Biden presidency. If anything, some argue that it will likely be strengthened, especially with several states including New York expected to file their own lawsuit, which may be combined with the DoJ’s effort.Additionally, the Biden administration has “the ability to amend that complaint,” says Charlotte Slaiman, the director of competition policy at the advocacy organization Public Knowledge. “There are actually more competition concerns around Google that could be included in a broader complaint,” she says, including potential anti-competitive practices in display advertising. Meanwhile, Andrew Sullivan, the President & CEO of the Internet Society, says that he is “hopeful” that a Biden presidency would mean “fewer attempts to interfere in the direct operation of the internet.” This did not mean a repudiation of antitrust regulation, he added. “There are many Democrats who would like those companies to be broken up too, so we might not see a big change in policy.” Refocusing the debate on Section 230 Biden has spoken out about the need to revoke Section 230, the section of the Communications Decency Act which shields internet companies from liability for the content that they host."

YouTubeTV was advertised in last nights NBA finals game. I think a lot of investors are realizing TV over the internet and not through a cable company is the future. Google owns YouTube hence the excitement on the stock.

"U.S. states prepare second antitrust lawsuit against Google for DecemberWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. states plans to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google as early as next month, according to two people briefed on the matter, potentially beating a more widely anticipated lawsuit from a different group of states led by Texas.The pending legal actions follow an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department against Alphabet’s Google in October.The bipartisan group -- made up of Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah -- is sometimes referred to as the Colorado/Nebraska group and has said it planned to combine its case with the federal government’s.Google has broadly denied wrongdoing in response to the government’s lawsuit and other probes, and the company said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them.Two people briefed on the matter said the Colorado/Nebraska group planned to file their lawsuit around mid-December, with one of the people saying a filing was expected in federal district court.Texas led a group of attorneys general from 50 states and territories which announced a probe of Google in September 2019. Fast forward a year, and Texas is leading a group focused on online advertising technology while the Colorado/Nebraska group has a broader probe under way.The Texas effort may be slowed by turmoil in the state attorney general’s office.One source pointed to disruptions after recent media reports said the FBI was investigating accusations that Attorney General Ken Paxton abused his office to help a political donor. Several of Paxton’s aides, who had become whistleblowers, resigned or were fired, including people who were key to the Google investigation.Texas has been aiming to find replacements, and it has promoted Shawn Cowles to be the deputy attorney general for civil litigation. But the turnover has led to delays.The Texas attorney general’s office could not be reached for comment.The Colorado/Nebraska group states’ broader inquiry contrasts with the Justice Department’s relatively narrow lawsuit, which focused on Google’s efforts to build and retain its dominance in search and its search advertising business."

"So this is where we stand with the Netlist lawsuit against Google for patent infringement:Reexamination Certificate was issued 02/05/2021 7 days would be the 02/12/2021. Sometime between now and Thursday will be a press release.Intel Xeon computer servers used for search results since 2009 until recently only allowed 768 Gigabyte DRAM memory, while Google uses 3072 Gigabyte all those years not possible without Netlist technique. Even now Intel 's limit is 1536 Gigabyte. Google needs 3072 Gigabyte to load a full Oracle database in the search server computers that deliver the search results to users of Google.Google is going to be paying a whole lot of money to Netlist, whether through settlement or jury decision"

"Money losing Google Waymo seeks outside investorsWaymo is talking to outside investors about raising as much as $4 billion in additional capital to fuel its self-driving efforts. And the company has discussed plans to eventually list publicly, spinning out from its parent Alphabet Inc., according to people familiar with the plans.But Waymo must first quell concerns about a recent string of departures that have raised questions about its strategy and the size of its lead in the field.Since February, Waymo has lost six key executives in rapid succession, including its chief executive officer, chief financial officer and several key lieutenants. John Krafcik, the outgoing CEO, had telegraphed his departure to some although it surprised many at Waymo and others at Alphabet, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. Waymo appointed two executives as co-CEOs and is recruiting a new CFO.These management shuffles come as Alphabet is tightening spending for costlier projects outside of Google. Waymo, born as a moonshot inside the search giant over a decade ago, has long been considered the standard bearer in autonomous driving and last year launched a ride-sharing service with driverless cars in Phoenix. Yet critics have pointed out the company hasn’t delivered on pledges to bring that service to more cities and settled on a commercial model.“Waymo is stumbling and bumbling,” said Raj Rajkumar, professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. “Right now it looks like it’s moving toward nothing.”"
Great price to add to the portfolio.

say NO to pay for a listing on Google Business. When google built it's maps and contacted businesses they were originally told it was free. Let Google have an inaccurate map. All Google Business does is give the public to rant and rail on your business while you have no control over it. There are better ways to get business. The downside for a Google Listing is tremendous. You can't make it go away. Think about the downside before you pay the so called one time fee.
"Tax issues and usually a soft quarter led to disappointment. However, considering the write-off, this was a minor selloff in the face of a 200+ pt. market drop and the weakness of late. Look for GOOGL to rebound and push to the 1200-1210 are before the next earnings report."

In my opinion it is only a matter of time before some of these giant tech companies are regulated to insure free speech or broken up. The question is what kind of time frame are we looking at. These companies have huge $ and they tend to support the incoming party. Income dictates stock price and GOOG has room to run before they feel the pinch of regulation. This is why I am bullish on goog and considering taking a position in it. Thoughts ? (I love $ more than I hate GOOG)
drop was a temporary blip...it's up 8 in premarket and will make new highs next week

Stock action is very disappointing at this point fortunately still very low volumes. I'm not sure why they're not entering the market to buy back stock since they should have plenty of buyback money at this point and the price is pretty good Does anyone know of any news that I'm not aware of thanks

That said I understand the severity of the virus should you be one of those folks with an underlying condition or at an elevated age but doesn't all of this ""shutting down the economy"" seem a little overdone? We all would love to see this come to an end sooner rather than later but the damage to our economy much of which will be unrecoverable is much much worse than the virus itself!"
Lots of disgruntled shorties are on this board..just pity them.

Wow...Sergey and other execs caught on tape...completely clueless on why Trump got elected and politics in general. He may be very smart on computer stuff but needs to grow up...a lot. GOP should disintegrate or do something drastic to Google (and FB maybe) before it's too late lest Google with just a touch of mouse button will decide who gets elected in the future.
"NLST won the patent case in court against GOOGL. Googl will have to pay NLST, no doubt!Although some claims of $10 billion is highly exaggerated, There is no question about at least a $1 billion. NLST market cap is only $90 million. At last, little guy CAN win!"
"Google smashed earnings with $16.5 per share profit in it's latest quarter $11billion & growing like a weed, so we Netlist should get $10billion + royalties for being such a crucial part of this success, with the search server 4X booster tech. And Netlist marketcap is $124M"

Something has to be done with all of these sell offs. Clearly all of these good earnings and big guys have to be selling.
Skimmed some of my Google profit and picked up 50k shares of NLST at .47. Playing the odds that Google is gonna settle with NLST for some good cash. NLST will move a lot more than this boat.

"WHY SENS WILL DOMINATE CGM MARKET IN 5 YEARS. DXCOM and ABBOTT External CGMs will become obsolete. The reason I am investing in Sens from a CPA and a husband of a T1D.The market: according to the ADA 1 in 3 Americans will be diagnosed with some type of diabetes by 2050. Not all diabetics will require a CGM but the T1Ds and insulin dependent type 2s will.The competition: the two main competitors are Dexcom G6 and Freestyle Libre. I intentionally left out the Medtronic guardian because in my opinion it is not of the same quality. Dexcom and Libre are basically competing with the same or similar product. A 10-15 day exterior sensor. SENS is differentiated from the competition in that it is the only implantable long-term CGM. Even if it doesn’t dethrone the competition there are going to be diabetics that want something different.The Company: Sens just signed a deal with Asensia which owns the contour next. A glucometer that diabetics use. In my opinion they saw the writing on the wall with CGM technology and needed to get aboard or they would drown. SENS was struggling and they found this. This deal offers Sens a superior distribution and commercialization channel. To get product to the people.The pipeline: CEO Goodnow said the 180 day sensor will be approved in the US at the End of Q2 due to delays at the FDA. They also said the 180 day trial went so well they were able to continue the 360 day trial to be approved later in 2021.The problems: the challenges we face are getting doctors trained to do the insertion and getting diabetics in the office. The sensor requires calibration, and it requires a charging.The benefits: the Eversense is the only long term CGM what doesn’t require changing every 10-15 days. If you are a Dexcom user you also know the sensor fails quite often not getting to the full days. This will not happen with Sens. The product also comes with an adhesive patch that can be removed any time the person wants to. Dexcom cannot be removed unless you want to waste a costly sensor.If Senseonics ever gets to the point where they have a 360 day product, with reduced or no calibrations and no exterior patch, with pump loop capabilities, it will dethrone the competition.I always like to say, diabetes is the best investment because any advances help the quality of my wife’s life, and if there is a cure and my investment goes to zero. Well it will be the best day of our lives.I have so much more to say but thought I would share."

"Turkey orders Google to change its online ad strategyGoogle is facing yet another fine for allegedly abusing its search ad clout, although the financial punishment this time is less serious than its implications. Arab News reports that Turkey’s Competition Board has given Google six months to change its ad strategy after determining that the company abused its internet dominance. Its text ads supposedly skewed results by pushing some companies out of the results unless they made ad money for Google.The online giant is also facing a fine equivalent to $25.6 million as part of the ruling. It has 60 days to appeal the decision, although it wasn’t initially clear if that would happen. We’ve asked Google for comment.This comes two years after Turkey fined Google roughly $12.7 million for supposedly favoring some advertisers over others.The financial penalty is trivial for Google when it makes billions in profit every quarter. However, the six-month deadline is another matter. If the ruling holds, Google faces the prospect of either changing its ad strategy or risking a ban in a country well known for its tight grip on internet services, including Google’s. It may need to strike a balance to avoid losing access to a key country."

If they can legally appeal the fine which they should be able to do it is going to mentioned on the conference call. If they handle the call properly the stock may not take a hit but they need good earnings and future outlook that is positive.
"I wonder who cares that Google Search is a monopoly. Other search engine companies? No one is being forced to use Google Search. Anyone can use a different search engine if they want. It's likely Google Search gives the best results. Most Android OS users are happy to give all their personal and private info to Google for ""free"" services. Most people would be lost without all of Google's services. I doubt the DoJ can touch Google but they're getting more support from various stages. Google runs the internet but so what. If consumers don't care, then why bother Google. Big investors love Google no matter how dirty Google plays to kill all rivals. That's a plus for investors. ""Don't be evil"" no longer matters when it comes to making money.The more the DoJ goes after Google, the higher the stock will rise. Google is part of the untouchable FANG group, so they have nothing to worry about."

I'm certainly happy with the stock price but GOOG could use a stock split. The stock price makes it difficult for small individual investors to buy shares. I realize it's purely psychological but many people feel better owning 100 shares of a $20 stock than one single share of a $2000 stock.

Guidance still higher than street estimate by $200M.I think this is great buying opportunity. I don't recommend stock at all time high normally but $NVDA and $GOOGL is exception to it.

Thec sectors should continue its growth faster than ever in the years to come.
"Judicial Watch Uncovers More Classified Emails in Hillary Clinton’s Unsecure Email SystemHillary Clinton repeatedly stated that the 55,000 pages of documents she turned over to the State Department in December 2014 included all of her work-related emails. She even declared under penalty of perjury in 2015 that she had “directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or are potentially federal records be provided to the Department of State, and on information and belief, this has been done.” It wasn’t, of course. Two years later, in 2017, the FBI uncovered 72,000 pages of documents Clinton attempted to delete or did not otherwise disclose. Until the court intervened, the State Department had been slow-walking the release of those documents at a rate that would have required that we and the American people wait until at least 2020 to see it all. We have now received 756 pages of newly uncovered emails that were among the materials Clinton tried to delete or destroy, several of which were classified and were transmitted over her unsecure, non-“state.gov” email system. The production of documents in this case is now concluded with the FBI being only able to recover or find approximately 5,000 of the 33,000 government emails Hillary Clinton took and tried to destroy."
it is June 30th 2020 and Google has still not compensated netlist for the patent that they have stolen. time to pay up Google do no evil remember?

"A new Android spyware masquerades as a 'system update'Security researchers say a powerful new Android malware masquerading as a critical system update can take complete control of a victim's device and steal their data.The malware was found bundled in an app called ""System Update"" that had to be installed outside of Google Play, the app store for Android devices. Once installed by the user, the app hides and stealthily exfiltrates data from the victim's device to the operator's servers.Researchers at mobile security firm Zimperium, which discovered the malicious app, said once the victim installs the malicious app, the malware communicates with the operator's Firebase server, used to remotely control the device.The spyware can steal messages, contacts, device details, browser bookmarks and search history, record calls and ambient sound from the microphone, and take photos using the phone's cameras. The malware also tracks the victim's location, searches for document files and grabs copied data from the device's clipboard.The malware hides from the victim and tries to evade capture by reducing how much network data it consumes by uploading thumbnails to the attacker's servers rather than the full image. The malware also captures the most up-to-date data, including location and photos.Zimperium CEO Shridhar Mittal said the malware was likely part of a targeted attack.""It's easily the most sophisticated we've seen,"" said Mittal. ""I think a lot of time and effort was spent on creating this app. We believe that there are other apps out there like this, and we are trying our very best to find them as soon as possible."""
GO GOOG AND TTD! 
bought 2 days ago awesome day
"GOOG is undervalue for sure. This stock will beat the estimate by a mile. Look at the way GOOG dominates the market, Google Map, Search engine, Youtube. All of them starts to monetize big time. I can see the ads in Youtube, increasing at the alarming rate. I think GOOG's PE at 21 is undervalue plus the cash over 100 billion dollars. It should the best among FANG."
I was wrong about GOOGL earlier they actually have $137 billion in cash when you include short term investments. Again I ask what case do the bears have here?
"Sell calls, don't buy. Calls option seller will win big today after earning come out."
"Big battle around 50 days moving average, it breaks and game over"
The YouTube music service announcement was a good $20+ news. Not sure if people did not get it or market has a delay.
Ok everyone let’s go back to work at this beautiful company and let’s send the stock UP.Go GOOGLE
To GOOG bashers: get a reality check
Crushed expectations 
"""People who work in warehouses and data centers for these trillion dollar companies (like Google) are tired of even their smallest rights being trampled on.""Join the union, demand fair treatment."
THIS IS A GREAT SHORT!
"GOOG committed treason by selling NLST IP 912 to China after stealing it, copying it, renaming it Caffeine, selling it to China so China could apply this stolen technology to any and all search engines, weapons systems, any and all military and oppressive social applications. GOOG acted as as an agent for the Chinese Communist Party to steal American technology in order to enrich themselves, strengthen China and compromise the national security of every citizen and of the nation itself. How is the DOJ not filing charges against every single GOOG exec who knowingly participated in and hid this most egregious theft in American history? Is that shoe about to drop? With the CIA joined at the hip maybe the gap gets filled or maybe this theft makes it easier to track China movements somehow but on it's face these are horrific actions taken by GOOG on all levels. This is Bond Film level evil that is so preposterous it's hard to believe anyone and any organization could be this evil but there you have it."
Can’t stand this stock any much longer
Did anything really change with GOOGL between Friday and Monday? No. It didn't. Will back back into the 1600's and into the 1700's next. Q3 is already baked and its going to be one fine cake. Watch.
Landed right over the high of the day!1100 Monday
"Our government does an inquire then they just move on, GOOG is a great buy today in my opinion, Overall, Alphabet's Monday selloff feels a little excessive, given that its shares were already about 15% below their 52-week highs as of Friday's close and trading at moderate forward EPS multiples in light of the company's possession of several valuable businesses"

"GOOG has gone rogue. It’s in China’s pocket, censuring America’s information and benefitting China’s efforts to control the internet. No longer should it be considered an American company."
In case your wondering why our stock price has gone sideways of late....It appears Google finds it more worth while to try and BUY ELECTIONS than to INCREASE its stock price for SHARE HOLDERS! Nearly 1Million Dollars given to OSSHole in the Georgia Runoff! Can you say embezzlement??
GOOG will maintain its dominance. You have to ride out the volatility.
Great buying opportunity tomorrow morning. GOOG killed EPS estimates and had major growth in YouTube ad revenue (31%) This stock is trading at a BARGAIN! $1500 by end of this week or beginning of next
"Have been out of GOOGL positions for sometime, open the 1st position in GOOGL at $1025."
This price is a gift.
"If you plan on holding for 10+ years then who cares if it goes up or down 10% tomorrow. You really think a company that has grown at the rate google has without debt won't be up massively in 10 years. Just buy the darn thing and don't look at it, unless you want to buy more as you raise more cash. Sure this may go to 1000 again, just buy more then. People trying to make a small profit due to short term swings are just stressing themselves out."
I have to admit.The ads they give me are way off base.
$12 in August and will hit $20 before end of year we are wrapping up $GOOG $GOOGL settlement in 3rd quarter per CC
Google may not hit 2000 but I would not be surprised if it surpases 1600. before the year is out.

"What Google really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Google (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Google just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

I am a newbie over here. And i am looking for some suggestions and recommendations.Do you guys this can touch $1500 again in the coming days or by end of February?
"Google is definitely a great business, but that doesn't make it immediately a great investment. Google's investment performance depends on future growth, and as the future is always difficult to predict, at a valuation of 30 the investment thesis is based on the unknown.I have looked at Google through the lens of Peter Lynch and his expectations for fast growth stocks. Unfortunately, despite having a strong balance sheet and cash flow, Google doesn't meet many of the requirements a good risk/reward fast growth stock should have.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkj0Nv5v-Jw&feature=youtu.be"
Stop loss at 1392(5 percent) . I don't see anytime bounce back. Too many negative news and index may crash again
Where’s the numbers
YouTube is down
"Hope Alphabet separate Tesla soon, typo waymo."
Geez don’t bears get tired? How about take a break for one day at least!
"AMZN beats tonight and soars, GOOG will rocket up into Monday earnings"
Google has 132 $ billions cash This great company has cash money more than many countries in the world
"GOOG wants to close green... how can it not in election year 2020? Self driving cars, payment solutions, cloud, youtube, worlds largest search engine, biotech, ads, marketing, google maps and and and.... perfectly financed and so ready for growth.... very innovative company with promising future services, products and applications...."
i think the reason its not totally tanking is they beat revenue pretty solidly didnt they? 40 billion vs 33 expected?
"Nice day only down -2.3%, great stock and company should have bought this years ago."
What's the catalyst today? Really!
"I’m long GOOGL, but does anyone else also think we’ll get a pullback this week? The NASDAQ chart appears that way, IMO."
Do we hit 2000$ in 2021?
Google Cloud is the fastest growing cloud provider in the world 
Just heard that GOOG got alerted at (http://webstock.today). I hope it pushes us higher!
alphabet owns a 7.5% stake in space X. the only way for you to invest in this co. That will probably never go public is to buy googl
stock split is long overdue for goog
"Watch AMZN to follow GOOG, if AMZN is going down not much, GOOG will move higher because GOOG has the higher RSI than AMZN at this moment. GOOG keeps pushing up the hardware a lot the last 2 quarters. This week GOOG joins the game streaming sector, which I think GOOG can do better than anybody because GOOG has Youtube as spearhead. Don't forget over 1.5 billion users use Google search and Google map everyday. At the same time Youtube has over 1.5 billion users everyday. So the ecosystem in GOOG is so strong, it only gets stronger."
I expected more from Google in the run today.
Missed revenue by 0.9% but beat EPS by 30%. Gets no love. Wonder how the stock market works!!
"I can’t think of a day in which I did not interact with a google product. Can’t say the same about Microsoft, apple pr amazon. Google is an exceptional company. I believe it will hit 1750 before the eoy."
It’s. 2000 stock selling on a huge discount
Stock has not moved for so long should be closer to AMZN price action someone here mentioning overbought what a joke.
Over Valued... haha
Congrats longs

WOW! BOOM!
huuuuggeeee beat...
It’s down 7 percent from it’s ALL TIME HIGH. be cool.
stocks are valued by mutliples of revenue and not by multiples of profit. So EPS doesn't matter all that much to a monopoly.
a few days or weeks this will pass and youl be buying it back
"Google made over $6 Billion for the quarter ended June 30th. They continue buying back common shares, enhancing quarterly EPS. They are still a cash cow. Any increase in revenues will send the stock price flying once again. I own FAANG. This must be the most underappreciated of my holdings. I love my GOOG."
Watch tomorrow: over the top
"My ""guess"" is that the market thinks Trump is too pre-occupied/busy with other things to start a fight with Google this week as many had been expecting. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Trump seems to be able to multi-fight quite nicely when he wants to."

"GOOGLE HANDED PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FOR “STEALING” SPEAKER TECH FROM SONOSSonos filed a lawsuit over claims that Google stole its multiroom speaker technology during its 2013 partnership with the company in which both agreed to work together in order to bring Google Play Music to Sonos devices. Apparently, Google then went on to create Chromecast audio, and later it’s extremely popular Google Home as a result – both of which went to market and may have severely undercut the audio experts.Now, a court ruling has handed Google a preliminary injunction which states that it can no longer sell its speakers or Chromecast devices in Germany, and may also no longer be able to provide Youtube Music to users living there either. Sonos states that Google violated one of its patents by “blatantly infringing” on its intellectual property. According to the original lawsuit from January of last year, which covered five patents on the Sonos wireless speaker design, Google sold its own products at a cheaper price and used them to gain more user data.“We’re grateful the court has acknowledged Google’s blatant infringement of Sonos’ IP,” said Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus in an emailed statement. “This decision marks a promising milestone in our ongoing effort to defend our innovations and stand up to the unfair practices of Big Tech.”"

"The Google Maps app directed me to a toll road in Orange County, California and I am getting fined for it.I was using the Google Maps app on my iPhone for directions from Costa Mesa to Irvine. The app, unlike my TomTom GPS, did not ask me if I wanted to avoid any toll roads. It did not occur to me that the default on Google Maps automatically takes me to toll roads unless I state when looking for directions I want to avoid toll roads. It NEVER asked me if I wanted to avoid toll roads. I had to go to Google's website once I got home to look for instructions on how to avoid toll roads on the Google Maps app. I think both the Toll Roads company and Google do this on purpose to nickel and dime commuters like me. That's not right and not fair.I put in a dispute, but in this day and age of blaming the victim, I'm not hopeful I'll prevail."
Google's stock move today shows what democrats are going to do to republicans.

"Please see below and consider the value of ""Google Radio"" replacing SiriusXM radio. It is a perfect time for Google to take over SiriusXM and leverage their relationships with the auto OEMs and take automobile technology and entertainment to the next level. Live media through an entertainment platform will always be the primary source of entertainment in a car and NOBODY has properly capitalized on this opportunity yet. SiriusXM cannot do it on their own and Google can do it almost overnight. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon will realize their miss right after it happens! Google, Apple, or Amazon needs to acquire SiriusXM to become the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the defacto source for mobile (and the home). SiriusXM has a great position but they don't have the resources and reputation like Google, Apple, or Amazon to make it happen. They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple. When held hostage behind the wheel of your car everyday, ""hey Siri"", ""Alexa"", and ""ok google"" should be the permanent passenger with you as there is no place you need them more than your car! ""Ok Google turn on my bright lights"", ""Ok Google turn on Pearl Jam Radio"", ""Ok Google read my text from Helene"", ""Ok Google navigate to my house"", ""Ok Google find a Jimmy Johns along my route home"", etc... When will these companies realize the value of SiriusXM and make a move to acquire them? Owning SiriusXM will catapult any one of these big tech companies right into the driver's seat! (no pun intended)"
"Alphabet price target raised to $1,800 after consumer survey at Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak raised the firm's price target on Alphabet (GOOGL) to $1,800 from $1,760 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares after the firm's AlphaWise survey showcased how Google ""remains top of funnel"" within U.S. e-commerce consumer behavior. More Americans visit Google first when researching products online than Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) combined, noted Nowak, based on the survey results.

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said: “Our strong results this quarter reflect the helpfulness of our products and services to people and businesses, as well as the accelerating transition to online services and the cloud. Google succeeds when we help our customers and partners succeed, and we see significant opportunities to forge meaningful partnerships as businesses increasingly look to a digital future.”Ruth Porat, CFO of Google and Alphabet, said: “Our strong fourth quarter performance, with revenues of $56.9 billion, was driven by Search and YouTube, as consumer and business activity recovered from earlier in the year. Google Cloud revenues were $13.1 billion for 2020, with significant ongoing momentum, and we remain focused on delivering value across the growth opportunities we see.”"

Want to see the look on the jury's face when NLST lawyers explain how Google denied having NLST IP in its servers but was busted when the judge ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined. Also how for 12 years NLST fought to survive while Big G thrived off NLST's 912 patent. Treble damages for willful infringement..if this isn't willful infringement then I don't know what is.

Someone is buying GOOGL at ask price all day long today. I wonder if this whale is Buffett. It make sense that he wants to diversify after buying too many AAPL shares. The right action is to sell some AAPL and buy some GOOGL.
"Google staff demand exec step aside after ethicist's firing - document(Reuters) - Staff on Google’s Ethical AI research team on Wednesday demanded the company sideline a vice president and commit to greater academic freedom, escalating a confrontation with management following this month’s termination of scientist Timnit Gebru.The personnel called on Vice President Megan Kacholia to be removed from the team’s management chain after she allegedly excluded Gebru’s boss from the decision to fire her, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.Gebru had questioned Google’s demand for her to retract a paper describing harms from Google-like technology, and the company answered by saying it accepted her resignation.The document also demanded an explanation of the dismissal, transparency into reviews of staff papers, and an investigation into how Google handles employee complaints about working conditions, like those Gebru raised while at the company.Separately, U.S. Representative Yvette Clarke, Senator Elizabeth Warren and seven other members of Congress wrote a public letter on Wednesday to Google-parent Alphabet Inc Chief Executive Sundar Pichai asking about plans to review Gebru’s firing and policies for publishing research.The demands represent the latest in a series of standoffs between Google and its critics since 20,000 of its workers walked off the job globally to protest how the search giant dealt with sexual harassment claims. The company changed policies thereafter.Gebru gained prominence as co-founder of the nonprofit Black in AI and as co-author of a landmark paper on bias in facial analysis technology. She was co-lead of the internet company’s Ethical AI team, which the employee document said was essential for informing the public on the impacts of AI systems even when that meant constructive criticism of Google.Google and Kacholia did not immediately return a request for comment. It was unclear how many people authored the demands, which followed a prior petition for academic freedom that garnered signatures from more than 2,600 people at the company."
Some people here predict GOOG at 800 ? Give the quality of the business and the financial strength i would really be surprised to see this happen. Though i would like it because it would be FREAKING GREAT to buy more at such a price. GLTA

"It proves two things.Google is a monster and will give you great returns for yrs to come. 20% revenue growth compared to last yr..but, the gains went flat by mid March. And now they are less than last yr.I wouldn't worry much about google if you are truly long but I would worry a lot about the economy. Late April's numbers are probably dropping like a sack of potatoes. The real bloodbath will be shown in Q2 earnings for many companies.If you bought reently I would take profits at 9AM and run away."

Google is getting the shaft from the Administration it helped elect.
"Between AAPL, AMZN and GOOG, I pick GOOG against the other two all day. I guess the earnings for the first quarter, GOOG will come out bigger than any quarter in the history.Look at the smart phone that flies out from BEST BUY. The Home Security comes out from Best Buy and Home Depot, I talk to the sales rep. they all have the same opinion that GOOG gets more market shares. Just wait for another 5 weeks we will know that GOOG passes the grade or not."

They are allowed to spew hatred, and we here can't even listen to conservatives. Google would have been a great partner for Germany during WWII. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0qmkt1kENY"

Just saying but this pulls back to 1300 by Friday options expirations. Mr market was only pricing in a $65 move and they don’t like to be wrong.
No wonder Sundar Pichai has been selling all of his stock in the last 9 months.
I see here lot of shortest in panic. Goog did nothing two years. 121 billions usd in cash. It was about time for a little breakout.

Maybe Google will finally do the right thing today and offer a fair settlement to Netlist and get this stain on their history behind them.
why would GOOGL fall AH? Didnt we report already? WTH

"The search advertising market may be 20 years old, but growth at the internet company has re-accelerated over the past three years. — which gets 99.5 per cent of its revenue from Google — is expected this year to turn in its highest growth rate since 2011, even though its revenue will be nearly four times greater than it was then. The $26bn in new business likely to be added this year is a stunning demonstration of the enduring power of Google’s core business."
When was the last time GOOG management said any positive?
"Let the pyjama traders sell in AH, share price will be much higher in 2 weeks."

GOOGL is the Berkshire Hathaway of Tech.
it will be a nice parting gift to the professor if we close double digit green.

A little morning buying and the shorts will drive it green trying to cover
long-term investor extremely uncomfortable with the left-leaning tech giants policies in general. however feel it's a great privilege to be able to own a small 100 shares. and we'll find a way to buy more if it goes any lower.

Question for all.. . . . which browser should I use in place of Google?
how does GOOGLE not pay a dividend???Talk about greedy
Tech heavyweights like GOOG and MSFT are wellsprings of innovation and undergird the world economy.
Sold my shares in this. Now I'm shorting it. LOL. Looking forwards to seeing this fall 500 points.
Nasdaq has gone up 12% in one month. It is time for some tanking. Recession already began in the 4th quarter. Big money controls financial media hence you will only start hearing bad news when big money is out of the market.

Don’t be disappointed if there is a post earnings selloff after the run up it’s had
Google is going to be the first trillion dollar market cap company
If Google can increase 100+ after earnings then imagine what will happen with Amazon and Facebook.... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Been long this stock well before the 2:1 split and accumulated shares during weak sentiment times. Could be going through another one of those times. Don’t think this is a traders stock have to be a long term investor to do well owning GOOG.
A good apple report will let this bounce 20-30 points tomorrow
I hope to see GOOG overtake AMZN by mid 2020.

"The time of making an aimless/non-brainer earning bet at Goog, MSFT a day or two days before earnings hoping for a 5% cash out is OVER. Goog is way overvalued in term of book value to share price, many times of tech average. When market starts to retreat, it has to deliver superb, astonishing results. Mediocre beat is no longer going to cut it. The regular dump on the earnings start to kick in since every upsides had already been factored in many times."
Should close around 900
The ceo is more interested in India then caring for USA. Never helped with purchase of any equipment for USA but wants to do it for India. Why? . Well I guess an Indian can only to USA for better future but will also help his country of origin. Not the country which gave him everything

Looks like Goog’s union won’t last in a Chinese version either. . . https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_relations_in_China
"Never look at expectations, only look at actual evolutions. Revenue increased by 15% compared with 2019Q1. On a comparable basis, EPS decreased from 11,90 to 9,87, that is a 17% decrease. The balance sheet remains of course fantastic. P/R ratio is around 30 now. This may seem rich but GOOG is one of the top 5 most dominant companies in the world, an amazing cash machine and as a consequence one of the best places to store your money in long term."

"For all the new/young investors tread very carefully in this market. If you are on margin - get off. If you trade options aggressively use limits on the downside. Don't think a few good trades means you know how to read this market. Once you fall into this trap you will get crushed. Protect your investments and don't put portfolio in a position so that you can never recover. There will be plenty of opportunities to make money over time but this market is sick and not going to get better any time soon. I've been investing for 25 years and have been though many market cycles. I've trade options, used margin, so I know the highs and lows or investing and trading. Protect your principal rule number one above all else."

I own a small accounting/tax firm and a lot of my small business clients are in financial trouble. I know a double digit percentage will go out of business (unfortunately advertising is one of the first things small business cancel)...those that survive. I know Google forecast calls for a 10% decline in ad revenues but I think it will be more like 20-25% folks.

"Google Must Face Suit Over Snooping on ‘Incognito’ Browsing(Bloomberg) -- Google failed to kill a lawsuit alleging that it secretly scoops up troves of internet data even if users browse in “Incognito” mode to keep their search activity private.The consumers who filed the case as a class action alleged that even when even they turn off data collection in Chrome, other Google tools used by websites end up amassing their personal information. A federal judge on Friday denied the Alphabet Inc. unit’s initial request to throw out the case.“The court concludes that Google did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode,” U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, wrote in her ruling.The ruling comes as Google and facebook face intense scrutiny by lawmakers over their data gathering practices.Three Google users filed a complaint in June claiming the company carries on a “pervasive data tracking business.” Google collects browsing history and other web activity data even after users employ safeguards to protect their data such as using “Incognito” private browsing mode, according to the complaint.“Google knows who your friends are, what your hobbies are, what you like to eat, what movies you watch, where and when you like to shop, what your favorite vacation destinations are, what your favorite color is, and even the most intimate and potentially embarrassing things you browse on the internet -- regardless of whether you follow Google’s advice to keep your activities ‘private,’” according to the complaint."
"Trade is setting up. Buy dip when DOJ begins to prosecute GOOG. Sell when price RS peaks. GOOG will agree to a fine, price roller coasters again. Unlike MSFT, GOOG doesn’t have Melinda Gates (on board of Washington Post controlling DC politicians) on their side."

"Under a shareholder capitalist economic system, using American technology, American educated employees, American incentives, American freedom, google made a tremndous fortune, and then turned its back on the country, and will now pay the price.

Pay the EU rate that you also love. Since they love Biden, let google pay his proposed corporate tax rate.Welcome news Justice Dept. Long overdue."
"Given Google’s TTM EPS of $75.03, the company is now trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 32 — forward P/E in the 20’s! This stock is ridiculously cheap for its growth. Can’t believe it’s only up 4% after ER. Buying heavily soon."

Look at the perfect line up of revenue and profits. I am excited about the next 10 years with Google."

Google ALPHABET on wikipedia to see all parts of this enterprise with its very promising applications and services. Very impressive....
Who thinks Google should censure video records/proof that someone has committed felonies? Of course not! Unless it affects a certain liberal president and his family. . . I wonder when papa Joe is going to start issuing pardons?

Google heading to $800 level.

"WHAT???? SAY IT AIN'T TRUE!THE MEMORY CELLS ARE WHAT IS REALLY RUNNING IT ALL!CAN ANYONE SAY PATENT 912... DOES THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE DDR 3 MEMORY CELL?ANYWAY... NETLIST was worth 10 dollars a share when this happened over 10 years ago. MetaRam was in on it too... they stole years and years and years of profit from Netlist and almost crushed them.Looks like only a decision for damages is due now to Netlist.http://googlecheatednetlist.com/Join the movement... at least one third of all profits since the time Google broke their Non Discloser Agreement with Netlist and took what wasn't theres and became rice while Netlist almost died.But we are here now and Alphabet (GOOG) needs to break a piece of them to keep everything running smooth and growing in ways of memory capabilities. Right now, it sounds, since they lost the appeal... they are losing the capability of memory storage because they lost the clouds with the Patient 912.Where am I wrong?Anyway... another web site has appeared and the movement is growing."

"And just like that, we close at almost $1,600. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see how incredible GOOGL is as a company. Nothing else compares. 35x 2021 EPS estimates = 35X55 = 1925 stock price. That is where we are heading to next!"

Google’s next quarter is going to be downright awful but they decided not to tell you that yet. The fact that this is higher is a major gift to investors. Really bad times ahead imo.
BINGO !!!! bought at $999
I agree Mike
1107 already in AH
$GOOGL $GOOG actually exceeded expectations. Earning was lower due to a One-Time charge of $1.7 Billion by European Union. But that is a one-time charge.

"California files to join US Justice Department's Google antitrust lawsuitIt's the first Democratic state to ask to sign on to the landmark complaint.Google's home state of California on Friday filed to join a landmark antitrust lawsuit brought against the tech giant in October by the US Department of Justice. California's request to be added to the complaint makes it the first Democratic state to ask to sign on to the case, potentially joining a group of 11 states with Republican attorneys general that are already supporting the DOJ's suit. California isn't making any ""substantive changes"" to the complaint or seeking to add any new facts, according to the filing.“Google's market dominance leaves consumers and small businesses with little choice when it comes to internet search engines,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. ""By using exclusionary agreements to dominate the market, Google has stifled competition and rigged the advertising market. We look forward to litigating this case to restore competition and innovation for California consumers.""The Justice Department lawsuit alleges Google broke antitrust law by cutting deals with phone makers, such as Apple and Samsung, to be the default search engine on their devices, a move that boxed out competitors. The agency also accuses Google of taking advantage of the dominance of its Android operating system to pressure device makers into preloading its search app and other services on phones powered by the software."

The department said that as part of an audit of several Google locations in Washington state, California, and New York, it had identified ""preliminary indicators"" that Google had failed to comply with a 1965 executive order that bars discrimination in the pay and hiring of federal contractors.That audit revealed early evidence suggesting that, between 2014 and 2017, Google had paid female engineers at its Mountain View, California, as well as Seattle and Kirkland, Washington, locations ""less than comparable male employees,"" according to the DOL."

"Netlist will be charging to Google $900 million per year for past use of the '912 patent from 2009 until 2020. $10 billion in total. The '912 allowed Google to put 4X the normal memory limit on a server, boosting their searches hereby 3X faster than the competition. In business the interest rate is much higher so conservatively 4% 11 to 20 years from 2009 & Google will be paying $1.5 billion yearly for the next 9 years until patent expires for the '912. We need to sell some hybrid memory to Google too, it has nice margins & is 80% cheaper than DRAM alone."

"California just passed a major privacy law that will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people and gather dataAaron HolmesWed, November 4, 2020, 10:34 AM PST • California voters just passed Proposition 24, a ballot measure that expands the state's existing privacy laws and scales back the amount of data that big tech companies are allowed to collect on people. • The law will make it harder for Facebook and Google to track people's activity through third parties, which could make much of the tech giants' advertising business models obsolete, experts told Business Insider. • While Prop 24 is active only in California, it will effectively apply to all of the US because of the state's huge influence on the tech industry.A new law passed by California voters in the November election will set an unprecedented standard for digital privacy in the US, making it harder for big tech companies like Facebook and Google to track people's data.The Consumer Privacy Rights Act, also known as Proposition 24, was on track to pass in California as of Wednesday morning, with 56% of voters supporting the measure and over three-quarters of ballots counted.The law will strengthen existing privacy measures in California, allowing consumers to stop businesses from selling or sharing their personal information, including race, religion, genetic details, geographic location, and sexual orientation.It will also set tighter restrictions on how websites track your data to sell that information to advertising partners. Google and Facebook — two of the largest players in online advertising — both gather personal data collected by third-party websites to strengthen their advertising products, which make up the bulk of their revenue.Prop 24 could effectively block companies like Facebook and Google from continuing to collect that data, which could change their business models and cut into their existing revenue streams, privacy-compliance experts told Business Insider.""The third-party adtech industry will need to evolve ... otherwise, their business models risk becoming obsolete,"" said Heather Federman, the vice president of privacy and policy at BigID, a data-privacy compliance firm.A Facebook spokesperson did not provide comment when reached by Business Insider. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. Neither company has publicly taken a stance on Prop 24.The law comes as online-ad giants' business models are facing other new threats. Apple is planning an iPhone software update that will let users opt out of ad trackers, which Facebook has vehemently protested. Web browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox are rolling out similar tools to let users opt out of tracking, which could cut into advertisers' revenue.Prop 24 will become enforceable in 2023. Before that happens, California regulators are expected to provide more details about how it will be enforced, which could shape its influence on major tech companies.Despite its potential to hurt the ad revenue of major tech companies, Prop 24 gained support from several tech business leaders who advocate privacy, including former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who said the law was necessary to give people more control over their data.Raju Vegesna, the chief evangelist at the global software firm Zoho, said he expected both private companies and governments to continue to crack down on third-party ad trackers because of growing privacy concerns from consumers. Vegesna added that Zoho removed third party trackers from its sites in July.""That means we leave money on the table, but just because it's there doesn't mean you have to take it,"" Vegesna said in an email to Business Insider. ""The privacy tipping point for most countries will come when they realize just how much data big tech companies such as Google have collected on their citizens and that as a government, there is nothing they can do about it."" Some privacy advocates have said the law doesn't go far enough, calling instead for Congress to pass privacy legislation that sets a single standard nationwide."

"YouTube channels making money from ads, memberships amplify Trump voting fraud claimsBy Paresh DaveOAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - At least nine popular YouTube channels were promoting on Thursday debunked accusations about voting fraud in the U.S. presidential race, conspiratorial content that could jeopardize advertising and memberships revenue they get from the video service.Reuters found the channels, ranging from ones with 1,000 followers to more than 629,000, endorsing claims that fact-checking units of the Associated Press, Reuters and other organizations have deemed false or inaccurate.YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google , has rules that forbid channels using its revenue-generation tools from making ""claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process.""Google said it was reviewing videos from the nine channels as well as others and may suspend ads and membership sales, a penalty commonly known as ""demonetization,"" if violations are found.Claiming voter fraud is widespread or that mail-in ballots cannot be trusted would be in violation, but highlighting people who say they experienced voter fraud or making hyperbolic statements about a political party ""stealing"" the election would not, Google said.With ballot tallying ongoing in a few states whose results will decide the hotly contested race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump has made unsubstantiated accusations about the Democratic party stealing the election. Trump's supporters have rallied behind the misinformation on social media and in protests outside vote-counting sites.Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc and others have struggled to guard against the misinformation as millions of posts arrive each day.Researchers who track misinformation say it is fueled by content creators who see an opportunity to profit from it. Over the last few years, they have pressured YouTube and its advertisers to tighten scrutiny.Some YouTube advertisers now avoid sponsoring political content. But the membership feature, under which fans pay a few dollars monthly for exclusive content and promotional merchandise, has helped offset lost ad sales.One of the channels seen by Reuters, John Talks, shared two videos on Thursday about alleged voter fraud in Michigan - a key battleground state in the election that Biden has won - generating more than 90,000 views in eight hours.Among the claims cited was that wagons, suitcases and coolers were used to smuggle ballots into a counting center. At least three news outlets investigated the claim and determined the items carried food for election workers and camera equipment for a local TV station.John Talks did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.The liberal online watchdog group Media Matters for America said in a report on Thursday that it found videos making dubious claims post-election have garnered more than 1 million views collectively.YouTube's policy on ""demonstrably false"" election information drew attention on Wednesday when CNBC reported that One American News Network was generating ad revenue from its YouTube video prematurely declaring Trump the winner. YouTube said it would not remove the video, but stopped running ads on it.Trump's talk of fraud has created opportunity for his critics, too. Some popular YouTube channels, which run ads and sell memberships, have generated hundreds of thousands of views on videos rebutting Trump supporters' claims of voter fraud."

"$AAPL $FB $MSFT $NVDA $TSLA $GOOG $GOOGL $AMZNNobody's paying attention, but every day these billion dollar companies are advancing their AI. The question I ask is, why such an aggressive move towards such a potentially dangerous thing? Elon Musk is a smart guy. A self described tech nerd. We all see the amazing things he's accomplished. We should all heed his warnings about AI-""The least scary future I can think of is one where we have at least democratized AI because if one company or small group of people manages to develop godlike digital superintelligence, they could take over the world,"" Musk said.""At least when there's an evil dictator, that human is going to die. But for an AI, there would be no death. It would live forever. And then you'd have an immortal dictator from which we can never escape.""AI IS HIGHLY LIKELY TO DESTROY HUMANS, ELON MUSK WARNS'Should that be controlled by a few people at Google with no oversight?'In Mr Musk’s opinion, there’s a very small chance that humans will be safe from such systems. “Maybe there's a five to 10 percent chance of success [of making AI safe],” he told Neuralink staff after showing them a documentary on AI, reports Rolling Stone.He also told them that he invested in DeepMind in order to keep an eye on Google’s development of AI.Mr Musk has called for the companies working on AI to slow down to ensure they don’t unintentionally build something unsafe.“I keep sounding the alarm bell but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react because it seems so ethereal.""“Between Facebook, Google and Amazon – and arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy – they have more information about you than you can remember,” he told Rolling Stone. “There's a lot of risk in concentration of power.

Selling google now is way short sighted imo. Their search will always be the best place anyone goes for unbiased results as long are they transparently indicate what results are ads and what are not. I doubt amazon will ever be able to match them. But perhaps google should ensure they always have unbiased rating results show up. Maybe they should buy outright or buy the rights to display consumerreports’ reviews in search results.
I see that Google is in Texas Court? Too bad for them but good for the consumer. Netlist just won in Texas Court and settled with SK hynix for patent infringement. That court in Texas really moves things quickly. Google has requested mediation with netlist and a mediator was appointed last week in the twelve-year-old case. to remind you Google lost the patent portion of the litigation when the federal appeals court upheld netlist patent with 78 claims against Google. amended infringement contentions are due June 18th anybody want to take bets that we settle before then? 12 years of willful infringement against netlist! Google it's time to pay up.

"It will be party time for GOOG Longs this afternoon. i have no doubt that GOOG dominates mobile ads pool this year. Forget about TAC cost. The only thing that investors concern about is the earnings growth rate. GOOG pays billions to AAPL, which everybody knows, but GOOG makes more eyeballs attaching to GOOG. I think this year will be GOOG year, PIXEL year, by taking advantage of the AAPL's I-PHONE stumble. Take lesson from NOKIA note, I-Phone is too expensive, Pixel quality is a lot better,particular camera. GOOG just needs to improve friendly user app., then AAPL WILL BE DONE."

I  my GOOG
GOOG has a near worldwide monopoly in search (excluding the red Chinese and their Baidu) and that position is being leveraged into all sorts of revenue streams. I bought some GOOG $700 ago but the valuation today is essentially the same. This is as close to a no-brainer as you'll ever find. I will be an Alphabe millionaire in 10-15 years. Don't get distracted by the other bets like Waymo. Pay attention to search and Youtube and take a stake on the next pullback.
only 4% up on these earnings??? ya ok right. and they wonder why retail hates wall street
Smart money is looking for a pull back to the $800s and I agree I am downgrading GOOGL to a strong sell

"Big tech firms to face 6% fines if breach new EU content rulesBRUSSELS, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Big tech firms such as Google and Facebook will face fines of up to 6% of turnover if they do not do more to tackle illegal content and reveal more about advertising on their platforms under draft European Union rules.The EU's tough line, which is due to be announced next week, comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny worldwide of tech giants and their control of data and access to their platforms.EU digital chief Thierry Breton, who has stressed that large companies should bear more responsibility, will present the draft rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) on Dec. 15.The Commission document on the DSA seen by Reuters defines very large online platforms as those with more than 45 million users, equivalent to 10% of the EU population.Additional obligations imposed on very large platforms are necessary to address public policy concerns and the systemic risks posed by their services, the document said.The tech giants will have to do more to tackle illegal content such as hate speech and child sexual abuse material, misuse of their platforms that impinges on fundamental rights and intentional manipulation of platforms, such as using bots to influence elections and public health.The companies will be required to publish details of their online advertisers and show the parameters used by their algorithms to suggest and rank information. Independent auditors will monitor compliance, with EU countries enforcing the rules.Facebook declined to comment ahead of publication of the EU document. Google said it had nothing to add at this stage."

"Maryland becomes the first state to tax on digital ads from Facebook, GoogleMaryland has approved the country's first tax on the revenue brought in from digital advertisements placed by companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.On Friday, the State Senate voted to override the governor's veto of the measure following a similar vote from the House of Delegates, The New York Times reports. The measure is expected to generate as much as $250 million in its first year.The Maryland tax specifically applies to digital ads that are displayed within the state. It's also levied based on the ad sales that a company generates. Companies that make at least $100 million to $1 billion a year will be taxed at a 2.5% rate. Companies that make more than $15 billion — which includes Facebook and google — will face a 10% tax on digital ad revenue.Legislators in Connecticut and Indiana have already introduced similar measures to tax social media giants.The tax legislation is just part of a growing debate about the dominance and power of technology giants. In the U.S., companies like Facebook and Google are facing multiple antitrust lawsuits. Antitrust legislation introduced at the federal level could target those companies. The measures in the U.S. also follow in the footsteps of governments in Europe, which have introduced both new restrictions targeting Facebook and Google."
Increased YOY expenses by 33% is keeping the lid on the blowout earnings.
"I doubt the gov't is going to do much to hinder GOOG's growth. After all, if they couldn't stop Boeing from producing and selling an airplane that essentially flew itself into the ground, they won't stop a behemoth like Google. There may be some kind of agency like the FCC eventually, but I'm sure it will be headed by a big tech exec. Much the way the Treasury Secretary's were all from Goldman Sachs.I just don't know why GOOG can't produce an ecosystem the way Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alibaba and even facebook have done. Besides their miniscule line of products, they're somehow limited to selling ads for most of their revenue like facebook! If Bezoz were running Google, he'd charge every company for every click-through (organic or not). He'd then target the most popular sites and create entire clone businesses. You wouldn't even need google to find anything b/c Google would be everything! Somehow GOOG just can't pull it all together. We still think of them for their search engine that was popular in the 90s. Amazon was a book store back then, but nobody remembers because they've been busy innovating and evolving. They now sell everything while Google is essentially still selling billboards (advanced billboards, but billboards)!!"
lol...why is Goog down because of the virus? Makes no sense...but just picked up some shares! good luck all
"FB beats on Revs and EPS, but plummets. GOOG could experience the same fate when they report - accordingly GOOG has fallen significantly AH. The runup bar has been set so high, these stocks are prime for 'buy the rumor, sell the news, even if the news is excellent.' Tempting to add back some shares AH right now, but will wait until after earnings, even if that proves to be a mistake by waiting. I've seen GOOG selloff before. Unrelated - TSLA is now trading like a cult internet stock. Two Questions for this chat board about potential quarter-ending charge-offs that are about to be reported: 1. Is it an 'expense' on the P&L to GOOG for the $4 Billion the founders got for their departure? 2. Is it an 'expense' on the P&L for the incentive compensation they gave to their new leader?"

"All in all the whole of markets are over bloated and in dangerous territories, over priced and no longer going on shares earnings per pricing fundamentals,most whole of markets are going on popularity favoritism based shares,most fund managers and people are not doing there DD or home work and keep telling people to keep investing in a over illed priced dangerous market hence just waiting to collapse,there is signs of a terrible market crash on the looming horrizon.The trouble with those signs is that while they are very obvious with the benefit of hindsight, they aren’t so easy to see in real time.In 1929, JFK’s father Joseph Kennedy Sr. picked up on one of those subtle signs and didn’t just get out at the top, he scored a massive windfall on the way down as well,yes he was one of those few who did not loose all his money back in the devastating 1929`s horrible crash,how did he know you ask..by sitting in a shoe shine chair having his shoes shined ...and yes it was the shoe shine boys advise that made him think drastically,this all very simple sign most people do not care to believe in or digest has always been proven strongly true time over time,soon once again it seems it will pronouce it`s coming more over."

Need a good conf call with good forward guidance.
"Google illegally tracking Android users, according to new complaintAustrian privacy activist Max Schrems has filed a complaint against Google in France alleging that the US tech giant is illegally tracking users on Android phones without their consent.Android phones generate unique advertising codes, similar to Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), that allow Google and third parties to track users’ browsing behavior in order to better target them with advertising.In a complaint filed on Wednesday, Schrems’ campaign group Noyb (None of your business) argued that in creating and storing these codes without first obtaining explicit permission from users, Google was engaging in “illegal operations” that violate EU privacy laws.Noyb urged France’s data privacy regulator to launch a probe into Google’s tracking practices and to force the company to comply with privacy rules. It argued that fines should be imposed on the tech giant if the watchdog finds evidence of wrongdoing.“Through these hidden identifiers on your phone, Google and third parties can track users without their consent,” said Stefano Rossetti, privacy lawyer at Noyb. “It is like having powder on your hands and feet, leaving a trace of everything you do on your phone—from whether you swiped right or left to the song you downloaded.”Google, which has roughly 300 million Android users in Europe, is facing a separate complaint from Noyb to the Austrian data protection authority, which argues specifically that users cannot delete the identifier from their Android devices.According to people familiar with the latest complaint, Noyb chose to approach the French data watchdog because its legal system is well suited to handling complaints under the European ePrivacy directive.Noyb also had concerns over the effectiveness of the Irish data protection authority—the de facto leader in European data privacy regulation—after a number of member states including Germany accused it of sluggish enforcement.Last year, Schrems won a landmark case at Europe’s highest court that ruled a transatlantic agreement on transferring data between the bloc and the US used by thousands of corporations did not protect EU citizens’ privacy."

IMO - Google is gonna be denied a retrial, won't waste their time appealing to SCOTUS and will settle and pay billions to NetList before risking a punishing jury trial. Just disgusted. NLST is gonna pop."

"DuckDuckGo warns new Google malwareDuckDuckGo has warned Chrome users about Google's new tracking method. The company in a blogpost mentioned that many people will be surprised to know that they have automatically entered into Google’s new tracking method called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) without asking for consent. According to the blog, FLoC is targeted at forming a group based on people’s interests and demographics that are easily fetched from browsing history. This allows the company to profile and target unwanted, creepy advertising along with content without third-party cookies.To help Chrome users get out of this tracking scheme, DuckDuckGo suggested people to not use Google Chrome. It said as of now, only Google Chrome has enabled FLoC and thus, it is not present in any other browser vendor. Other vendors have not even expressed an intention or interest for implementing such trackers. Since many browsers are free to download, the blog urged people to get some Google alternatives. For iOS or Android users, the company suggested that they use Safari or their own mobile browsers because they have privacy protection by default when searching and browsing."

Time to announce a big share repurchase to make up for this. Maybe even a 4 for 1 split.

"People who don’t like GOOGL can’t call this stock trash due to the financials. High gross margin, low debt, very low debt leverage, 18 billion in net cash, and 31 billion free cash flow. And that’s just for starters. Bottom line the haters will hate. They are just angry they didn’t get in 8 years ago like I did. You can not like the company for moral reasons but when it comes down to fundamentals the company is inexpensive even at these levels and it is drowning in cash."

"Google sued by Texas and 9 other states accusing it of 'antitrust evils'Google (GOOG, GOOGL) was hit with a lawsuit from Texas and 9 other states Wednesday accusing it of anticompetitive behaviors related to its ad tech business, which has faced scrutiny due to its unrivaled size and volume.The suit claims that internal documents show that Google tried to crush competition with exclusionary tactics, including by striking a deal with Facebook (FB) — its biggest competitor — to manipulate advertising auctions.“The Supreme Court has warned that there are such things as antitrust evils. This litigation will establish that Google is guilty of such antitrust evils, and it seeks to ensure that Google won’t be evil anymore,” the 130-page lawsuit stated.The suit comes less than two months after the Department of Justice and 11 U.S. states, including Texas, filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Google of engaging in anticompetitive behavior in its search and search advertising businesses. Texas is leading the latest suit focusing on the ad tech business, joined by Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah.As with the Texas-led suit, the DOJ’s lawsuit included mention of an agreement between Google an another Big Tech firm. In that instance it was Apple (AAPL), which the DOJ alleges joined with Google to make the company’s search engine the default for its various products including Siri, its Safari browser, and its Spotlight search.“Google repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing, engage in market collusion to rig auctions, in a tremendous violation of justice,” Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a video posted on Twitter. “...If the free market were a baseball game, Google positioned itself as the batter, the pitcher, and the umpire.”On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Texas had hired prominent lawyers to work on its case against Google, including the Lanier Law Firm, home to Kenneth Star, who famously led the Whitewater investigation into Bill Clinton.Google’s digital advertising business has faced scrutiny due to its unrivaled size and volume. The company controls some of the most important pieces of the online advertising marketplace, its Google Marketing Platform, formerly DoubleClick, is a premier tool for online publishers, helping them create, manage, and track online marketing campaigns.‘Hallmarks of a highly competitive industry’Critics of Google’s dominance of the online ad industry point to the fact that their web traffic would take a severe hit if they left the company’s platform as proof that it is too powerful.In the suit filed Wednesday, the states alleged Google lie to publishers using its ad server to favor Google’s ad exchange and that the company entered into an illegal agreement with Facebook that benefited both companies by flattening competition in so-called “header bidding,” a method of ad bidding that was developed to circumvent Google’s grip on advertisement exchange markets.What’s more, the suit claims that Google violated users’ privacy by signing a 2015 agreement with Facebook that gave Google access to millions of Americans’ end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp messages, photos, videos, and audio files.The October suit filed by the Justice Department and 11 states targets deals that Google has with device makers like Apple (AAPL), browser developers, and wireless carriers like Yahoo Finance parent Verizon (VZ) to make Google the default search engine. Those agreements effectively shut out competition for search, the suit alleges.On Thursday, Google is expected to face a third antitrust lawsuit, this one spearheaded by a bipartisan coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Colorado and Nebraska, Politico reported Tuesday. That lawsuit will reportedly allege that Google designs its search engine to disadvantage rivals."

"I am a big advocate for Apple and Google and I see this great opportunity for either of them and just hope that one of them sees it the same way before Amazon, ATT, Disney, and Microsoft does. Google or Apple are the only 2 that can fully capitalize on the opportunity but the others can sure gain as well if they make the move.Everyone seems to be focused on video steaming and the competition is so heated between Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, ATT, Disney, and Google. Everyone is fighting for subscribers in that area while automobile entertainment has yet to be properly claimed by anyone. There is such a great opportunity to not only take over automobile entertainment but also automobile technology, which will eventually dictate the consumer's mobile entertainment choices. If the company that capitalizes on this opportunity also has a streaming video product, the potential service consolidations and packages will open up so many opportunities to accumulate subscribers and cross sell other services all related to how people are entertained (video and audio).Please see below and consider the power of the label ""Apple Radio"" or ""Google Radio"" replacing SiriusXM radio in every car. It is a perfect time for Apple or Google to take over SiriusXM and leverage SiriusXM's existing relationships with the auto OEMs and take automobile technology and entertainment to the next level. Live media through an entertainment platform will always be the primary source of entertainment in a car and NOBODY has properly capitalized on this opportunity yet. SiriusXM cannot do it on their own and Apple or Google can do it almost overnight. Microsoft and Amazon will realize their miss right after it happens! Just like mobile phones, every dashboard should have a standardized open api Apple or Google OS behind it, and taking over SiriusXM is the open door to that start down the path of vehicle entertainment, connected vehicle, vehicle technology, and vehicle OS standardization. Google or Apple will own the car like Microsoft once owned the PC.Google, Apple, or maybe Amazon can shortcut becoming the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology by just acquiring SiriusXM. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming not only in the car, but on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the consumer defacto source for mobile (and the home). SiriusXM has a great position but they don't have the resources and reputation like Google, Apple, or maybe Amazon to make it happen. They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple. When held hostage behind the wheel of your car everyday, ""Siri"", ""Alexa"", or ""Google Assistant"" should be the permanent passenger with you as there is no place you need them more than your car! ""Siri turn on my bright lights"", ""Siri turn on Pearl Jam Radio"", ""Siri read my text from Helene"", ""Siri navigate to my house"", ""Siri find a Jimmy Johns along my route home"", etc... When will one of these companies realize the value of SiriusXM's current position being so far down the path with no competition, great content, and all the auto OEM relationships / understanding? Taking what SiriusXM has and changing the name to Apple Radio or Google Radio would catapult the respective company right into the driver's seat! (no pun intended)"

Hopefully the SCOTUS will agree with every court that has heard this case for the last 12 years and reward us Netlisters some of GOOG.

"Mo lawsuits, mo money."
Google is increasingly controlling what you see on the internet. Their search for example is not a fair representation of what you may be looking for and is skewed to profit Google while also exploiting your interests and identity to further enhance their wallet.

When I saw Google at 300 years ago I thought there was no way something that wasn’t tangible and I couldn’t hold my hand could ever go any further here we are today and most people feel the same about cryptocurrency.
Alphabet just earned 26.29 per share in Q1. 2021 average EPS estimates are around $70 per share. What's wrong with this picture?
"Is everyone aware that Google is the only company that you can invest in, that owns a stake in SpaceX? SpaceX the company that is in beta for the revolutionary starlink sat system. SpaceX the only company in a position to be the first to lasso and asteroid. A single asteroid could net a quadrillion dollars worth of precious metals. Google is a great and innovative company, SpaceX is the future."
"Finally, no negative comments"
"It's a very nice deal they've cut with Shopify. Shopify cannot create mall spaces for their 1.7Mln merchants because it would conflict their position, but Google can do it in a fair way. I do out of my way to source and support Shopify merchants, and Amazon-as-catalogue-service has been deteriorating since merchants began the move to Direct to Consumer. And perhaps they can help each other in China too, as both companies face challenges there.Long GOOG 5yrs, Long SHOP 4yrs. Hope this is a great partnership for both!"

Nice to see Google justly rewarded after a solid beat for this quarter. Unlike Apple's $111.4 billion in revenue beat from last Q1– which the market unfairly sold off down almost 20% post earnings . Let's hope Apple gets some due credit this time as well.Disclaimer:I own both GOOG and AAPL.

What is wrong with GOOGL? It is supposed to be the best tech stock. It has low P/E and true monopoly.
The fomo stocks with no earnings are flying high and those with real earnings are getting decimated. Welcome to the new stock market.
Good all tech stocks need to take a hit. Big tech bubble right now. Tech needs to drop so rest of market can recover.

Google just lost to Nlst in court gonna have to pony up 700 million for patent infringement on cloud technology nlst uo 105 % today
"GOOGL's financials are truly breathtaking. Let's teach these shorts a lesson on why it is suicide to short this shall we? PE of only 38 and this is a growth stock...not an unreasonable valuation at all. Beta of exactly 1...so rising rates are not going to affect this company at all. Let's dive into the financial ratios....gross margin 54 percent, EBITDA margin 30 percent, operating margin 22.5 percent, net margin a whopping 22.1 percent, leverage nonexistent. Let's move into growth rates....current quarter revenue growth rate 24.7 percent, earnings growth rate over the next 5 years 16.95 percent, market implied 5 year compound annual growth rate 21 percent as of yesterday. inventory turnover more than 3 times the industry median, the list goes on and on. Netlist longs will get pocket change assuming this lawsuit actually is victorious which is very questionable, people like me that have been long since 2013 will barely feel a pinch from the decline, as will GOOGL. So I expect tons of thumbs down but why you would short a company with the kind of revenue growth and earnings growth and free cash flow growth GOOGL has is beyond me. And those who think GOOGL won't recover should they lose all these lawsuits don't realize that the company has zero competition and excellent management to boost. From a money making standpoint this company is a no brainer over the long haul."

Google will recover when they decide to do the right thing and pay netlist for the technology they have stolen. it's coming soon. as a Google investor you should be mad they have deceived you. if they let it go to jury award it will be record setting.
Time to break up google into pieces with antitrust legislation.
Goog vs NLSTNETLIST won that case after Google engineers told the judge that they had removed all offending modules. The judge said great you would not mind a court ordered audit then. He sent in a team to randomly select severs for audit and found Netlist IP in them manufactured by a company called Metaram. Google was found guilty of infringing on NLST IP . The jury was about meet to declare damages on Google. Google then challenged the validity of NLST 912 patent Netlist and google agreed to a stay of the damages until the patent was fully vetted by the USPTO. That has been completed and USPTO found in favor of NLST. So stay can be lifted and the judge can assemble a jury to determine a just award to NLST. Or Google can come up with a figure on their own settle and avoid court.Also be aware this has been a 10 year plus legal battle in addition Google engineers lied to the judge saying they had removed all offending modules. I think lawyer costs fees should also be a factor in the settlement.

The day of Reckoning is getting closer Google. Judgement day for your crimes of IP theft against Netlist gets closer every day!On June 15th 2020 Google lost at federal appeals court to netlist for patent infringement. The unanimous rule 36 judgement affirmed the decision of the patent court and validated Netlists 912 patent. Google continues to stall and faces Treble damages for over 10 years of infringement.
"Forward PEG is 7, and pe is 34. Sorry guys you won't make any money with Google. The growth potential is just not there anymore. Expect to see Google around 1200. Same also applies to FB with PEG 6 and PE 35. Since the growth rate has been decreasing years over years you they shouldn't be trading at these high PEs. You should be considering buying these companies from 18-22 PE not 35, Long won't make any money. $FB $GOOG"

"It looks like Trump is shooting for one term presidency. Does the guy think he can put both $GOOGL and $FB on investigation for anti-trust and put tariffs on Mexico, while alienating long standing European allies on the backdrop of increased consumer prices generated by China’s tariffs? Lol, the guy is a goner. All these people directly hurt have tons of relatives and the others have strong business ties to US that are taking a direct hit. Balance of voting power he needs is gone even if he mobilizes the entire potential MAGA crowd. MU will be safe, regardless of Trump’s increasingly irrational moves.I am only an observer, I am not pro or against Trump, I generally regard American politics as the main source of the post-war American deterioration."
I don't think googl will split but I would love for them to announce a one time dividend payout. give some of that cash to us if you're not going to use it. reward the shareholders.
"NEWS ALERT >>>>>>The theme of powerful earnings gaps continues with our next pick. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a history of the direction of its jump following earnings signaling the price trend for the quarter. Down gaps have usually sparked multi-month downtrends while up gaps have kick-off or accelerate uptrends.I’m betting last week’s pop will prove no different. The robust earnings beat that drove traders to push GOOGL stock up 9% in a single session will likely continue to support the stock moving forward. And that makes GOOGL a tempting buy into any weakness, like the past three trading sessions. Compared to the beatdown elsewhere, yesterday’s post-Fed slip in Alphabet shares was nothing."
"If Google is forced to charge licensing fee for Android , 2 billion devices x ~10/phone, can generate billions per year."
So SHOP has doubled after CEO said they r getting demands from SB to go online and can’t keep up. Pretty sure those SB will need help from GOOG with ads so I’m confident the ER will be just fine.
Just got another reason to short Google besides the 78 patent claims they lost against netlist. Big tech are the worst managed companies in the world.They are communists as well as thieves i see.
Alphabet will probably never reach a valuation much more attractive than right here right now. I've been adding to my position for years. Every time I do I reevaluate. It never gets much cheaper than 21x forward earnings.
GOOG full steam ahead!
"Alphabet stock rises to potential record after earnings smash expectationsAlphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) shares roared to prices that would be record highs if they occurred in regular trading, after reporting second-quarter earnings Monday afternoon that were slammed by a recent record antitrust fine out of Europe yet easily surpassed expectations. The Google parent company reported $3.2 billion in net income for the quarter, which works out to $4.54 a share, down from $5.01 a share a year ago, when the company also dealt with a big antitrust fine out of the EU Without the fine, Alphabet would have reported earnings of $11.75 a share, the company said, well higher than analysts' average estimate of $9.64 a share, according to FactSet. Alphabet reported revenue after accounting for traffic-acquisition costs of $26.24 billion, up from $20.91 billion in the second quarter of 2017 and higher than the average analyst estimate of $25.58 billion. Alphabet shares jumped nearly 5% in after-hours trading Monday to prices higher than its intraday record of $1,221.59, following a 1.1% gain in regular trading to $1,211. The company's class A shares have gained 15% so far this year, as the S&P 500 index has increased 4.8%."
big money
will be 1120 by end of day
I don't understand why people pay such premium prices for GOOG and FB. Their business model is not as good as it used be. There are so many competitors in the game right now. Goog's growth game is over. Just look at their growth chart. It has been decreasing for years and now became negative. Good luck people. A correction is inevitable bear in mind.

"Amazon getting into GOOG advertising business in a big way, won’t be pretty when the big tech start cutting prices fighting for market share or maintaining market share, they all will lose."
Google regarded patent 912 as inpatentable and behaved as such in using the patent... This turns out to be a false assumption of Google. Anyone knows who assembled the memory modules and what the involvement of China is as a supplier of memory modules for Google? If Google disclosed Netlist IP to a Chinese company that would make this case even more explosive and is an additional urgency for Google to settle before matters complicate to political level!!!
"I’ve got a question for those saying the big tech is overvalued. Why do you say so? Are you saying that just because you personally don’t like the companies?FB and Google are currently at around 30 P/E. If you take a step back to look at the big picture, they are all relatively young companies with huge potentials for future growth. AR is inevitable, the pandemic has sped up the adoption of tech, on the macro we can’t imagine the world without Google anymore - at the very least, it’s our database which we carry around in our pockets and use daily. Our lives are and will continue to revolve around those companies. Can you imagine the world without Google in 5-10 years? Can you see Google go down because of a few antitrust lawsuits and privacy legislation changes? If so, who will replace the company? Or do you just think we’ll turn around and go back 20+ years back in time? :)I’m genuinely interested in your arguments.."
"A Judge recently told Gov Gruesome he could not act independently to restrict the freedom of California residents. The Judge said a lot of what he already did was illegal, and not to do it again. perhaps this Judge will give Gruesome some well earned time in a cell, to think about his illegal actions. The good news is, liberals in the EU, according to Deutche Bank, are considering taxing stay at home workers 5%, to make up for lost revenues. That would be great here, making thousands of google workers pay a 5% tax, since a lot of what we are now suffering through has been enabled by them. Besides, every good liberal wants higher taxes."

"Facebook and Google signed secret pact to ‘maintain status quo’ and avoid competing, report allegesFacebook and Google allegedly made a secret agreement to assist one another in any antitrust cases investigating online advertising.The two technology giants are currently facing such a suit, filed by 10 US states led by Republican attorney generals. They accuse Google of abusing its power in online advertising to crush competition.They said the company’s anti-competitive conduct even included a deal with rival Facebook to “manipulate” ad sales.The alleged deal, which was seemingly codenamed “Jedi Blue”, states that the companies will “cooperate and assist each other in responding to any Antitrust Action” and “promptly and fully inform the Other Party of any Governmental Communication Related to the Agreement,"" according to an unredacted draft of the lawsuit seen by the Wall Street Journal.In the lead up to the deal, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was reportedly told that the company had to “invest hundreds more engineers” and spend billions to compete with Google, or make a deal with the search giant – details which do not appear in the final lawsuit.Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg reportedly signed the deal with Google, according to the draft, telling Mr Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives that it was “a big deal strategically.”The draft states that in the fourth year of the deal, Facebook had to spend at least $500 million on Google’s ad auctions.“Facebook is to win a fixed per cent of those auctions,” the draft version says. The final lawsuit only reveals the first three words; the rest of the sentence is redacted.This deal is said to be “relatively cheap” according to internal Facebook documents described in the draft lawsuit, compared to competing directly in the ad auction.If Google could not “avoid competing with” Facebook, it would “build a moat” in order to protect the companies, according to a Google presentation mentioned in the draft lawsuit. The direct quotes are not included in the finalised lawsuit.Another internal Google presentation from October 2016 states that the company was concerned about competition from Facebook and that it needed to “to stop these guys from doing HB [header bidding]” – a process by which Facebook could programmatically purchase advertising.“We probably need to consider something more aggressive,” the draft states. A subsequent communication from Google in 2017 reportedly said the company’s aim was to “collaborate when necessary to maintain status quo.”"

Don't forget that GOOG improves a lot in term of new products, hardware, software. GOOG should beat AMZN this year in every issue. Home security and accessories, GOOG is the JOHNNY COMES LATE, but with a big muscle, GOOG will beats out ALEXA by next year because GOOG products have better quality more than AMZN. GOOG will use AI which GOOG has very advance lead time than AMZN. Just remember AMZN is the good logistic company and uses it to make E-commerce its advantage,but come to software, AMZN never has name in this area. I think AMZN too expensive at this point.

When was the last time GOOGL announce anything positive to move the stock?
"Google claims it has purchased Fitbit, but US government says investigation is ongoingGoogle and Fitbit have announced that the companies are merging, but the US Department of Justice says that investigation of the acquisition is still ongoing.“Today, I’m excited to announce that Google has completed its acquisition of Fitbit and I want to personally welcome this talented team to Google” wrote Rick Osterloh, Google’s Senior Vice President of Devices and Services in a blog post on 14 January.Fitbit CEO James Park wrote that “Fitbit is now officially part of Google”.However, Politico reporter Leah Nylen reports that the US government “has not reached a final decision about whether to pursue an enforcement action.”“The Division continues to investigate whether Google’s acquisition of Fitbit may harm competition and consumers in the United States. The Division remains committed to conducting this review as thoroughly, efficiently, and expeditiously as possible”.Such confusion comes as Fitbit users who had deleted their account ahead of the prospective merger nevertheless received emails from Fitbit to private addresses.“In 2019 I made a HUGE deal about having you permanently delete my data before Google bought you, and your helpdesk said you erased me. Yet I just received an email from you at my private email address. How did this happen?”, wrote software engineer and author Tanya Janca.“I do not want google having my personal data that I kept in your systems. You promised me (check your DMs to me) that I was erased, BEFORE the merger”, she continued.Chris Garaffa, author of the technology newsletter “Tech for the People”, said they had experienced the same occurrence.Neither Google nor Fitbit responded to a request for comment from The Independent before publication.Google paid $2.1 billion for the acquisition of fitness-gadget maker Fitbit, although news of the merger raised alarms from privacy critics.Google makes most of its money by selling ads based on information it collects about its billions of users' interests and whereabouts. Privacy watchdogs feared it might exploit Fitbit to peer even deeper into people's lives."

And Zuckerberg, well, it’s already reported that he’s been having NIGHTMARES because of the threat TikTok poses to Facebook"
"Anyone not buying at these levels is leaving a pot of cash on the table.Next week, Google should be 1250+ plus, when analysts' ring in upgrades based on valuation."
Green by day's end. GOOG gravitates towards green.
-0.35% now. How about tomorrow?
I learned it the hard way that I must watch the earnings report calendar for every stock I own: I sold my GOOGL.......YESTERDAY after holding it for 5 months! OUCH!!!
"GOOG should NOT do a stock split. I will settle for $10 - $67 daily upward jumps. This way they keep the quantity of outstanding shares at a reasonable level. If someone invests $50,000 in any stock, they seek solid annual percentage ROI, regardless of how many shares the $50k buys them. Further, fractional shares can be purchased by new younger investors. Personally, I prefer the higher dollar stocks. All IMHO. Counter opinions welcomed."
"GOOG AMZN FB TWTR - all struggling. I own Google and Amazon, but do believe in Freedom of Speech without censorship. I would hate being 'cancelled' simply for having differing views from the majority. Isn't this the USA?"
2000 after earnings ...or if they announce a break up . Either way GOOG is headed to $2000+ in few months
Google v. Oracle Perspective: Google’s Android ‘Cheat Code’ was to Copy Oracle’s Codehttps://www.ipwatchdog.com/2020/08/05/google-v-oracle-perspective-googles-android-cheat-code-copy-oracles-code/id=123789/
"Google's advertising practices targeted by EU antitrust probeBRUSSELS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have sought information from advertisers regarding Google's advertising technology practices, a European Commission document seen by Reuters shows.Alphabet-owned Google, the world's largest online search engine, has been hit with fines totalling 8.25 billion euros ($10 billion) in the last three years for blocking rivals in online shopping, Android smartphones and online advertising.It now faces two European Union investigations into its advertising practices, focused on technology and data.Google and Facebook together capture over half of the internet ad sales market globally. Both companies are currently the target of a U.S. lawsuit over their 2018 deal which gives Facebook's advertiser clients the option to place ads within Google's network of publishing partnersGoogle said it was cooperating with the Commission, whose 13-page questionnaire sent to advertisers this month asked about the impact of using the default setting 'Include Google Display Network' introduced in 2018 for search campaigns on Google Ads.""We compete with many others in the industry and give people granular controls over how their information is used to personalize ads and limit the sharing of personal data to safeguard people's privacy,"" a Google spokeswoman said.The Commission said the questionnaires are part of its investigation into Google's data usage.""This investigation covers all services of Google, including digital advertising and the ad tech chain,"" the EU competition enforcer said on Wednesday.The EU also wants to know if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources.The questionnaire also asks whether the ability to access Google's YouTube is tied to the selection of an intermediary.It asked if Google's integration in 2018 of its online ad delivery unit DoubleClick impacted advertisers as well as any imminent impact from its plan to phase out third-party cookies on the Chrome browser by the end of 2022."
yes! full steam ahead!
Earnings coming up in April. HODL Y'All!
"So, all the pundits saying GOOGL is the stock of the 'big 4'. Well, they forgot about AMZN. That stock is exploding upward now - on a 2 day huge gain. Meanwhile, GOOGL is fading. Oh, how these 'experts' are always wrong."
"There is no mistake, we also bought Netlist shares. Obviously, Google is interested in partnering with Netlist. The JEDEC General Committee has already coordinated Google lawyers with due consultation.Preemptive actions to sign a settlement will become a solid, and further authoritative, influence of Google’s business reputation (Goodwill) on the electronic industry, and in general the competitive industrial production of Netlist in the interests of the Corporation."
Volatility is especially pronounced these days. Hang in long term.
Upgrades are coming tomorrow. Google is a cash machine.

As predicted strong Friday. $1200 early next week.
Let's close above this $1600 level...
Earnings whisper number is good. Should be a good week next week.
Sell your GOOG stock and roll proceeds into GOOGL as the voting stock GOOGL is trading at a discount to non-voting GOOG. This is a no-brainer the voting stock GOOGL always trades at a premium to GOOG until today. Great opportunity to get the better class of shares that have traded at a $35 dollar premium to non voting GOOG in the past.
GOOGL is a top tier stock to own despite all the bad press its been getting lately
Needs to pull back to 1950 zoneBefore any new buys are made

"Google hogs traffic for itself, according to data showing nearly two-thirds of searches ended without a click in 2020Per data compiled by Rand Fishkin, the CEO of audience intelligence platform SparkToro, 65% of Google searches on mobiles and laptops ended without users clicking through to another domain.The takeaway is that in a large number of cases, Google is directing its billions of search engine users their valuable eyeballs at its own properties. Google, alongside Facebook, dominates the digital ad market and in the fourth quarter of 2020 pulled in $32 billion in revenue primarily from search.Fishkin previously published research in 2019 that suggested just over 50% of Google queries ended without a click. He warned that it was tough to compare the 2019 and 2020 research because he used different data sources as the basis for analysis but, he wrote, the trend was one of ""increasing click cannibalization by Google.""Of major concern to Google critics will be the idea that the search giant is finding ways to keep people on its own properties, potentially at the expense of third-party sites and publishers.For example, a Google search for ""COVID-19 deaths"" offers the below, with information pulled from the likes of the New York Times, Wikipedia, and the World Health Organization placed at the top of the page, ahead of clickable links to their sources.Google is under pressure over the way it presents results in the US and EU, specifically its ""OneBoxes"", the prominent squares of text or images that pop up when you search, for example, holiday destinations or the weather in a particular city.A host of job and travel companies have accused the tech titan of using its dominance in search to expand into specialist search services, like Google Flights or Google Travel, at the expense of competitors.In a letter signed by the likes of TripAdvisor, Expedia, and Trivago, more than 130 accommodation, travel, and job vacancy firms from around the world said claim Google has ""[leveraged] its unassailable dominance in general Internet search ... to gain a competitive head start."""

Selling google and moving over to FB. FB will be just fine. Weasel companies using FB to show us how pc and ethical they are. They just used this as their excuse when they needed to cut spending anyway. Google about to be exposed in a big way.
The Dems owes too much to Google so Google won't be missed with! Antitrust=Not happening and if Google was broke up it would be worth much more than it is!
About 80% of the posts on this board are negative. The shorts must be having a fit today.
"Google is good investment, even though Google is not ethical. If you are a youtube partner you can't broadcast elsewhere. So, basically they are using their monopoly position to force people to choose them or loose money. Which is a good way to keep broadcasters."
Don't get it. We should be at 1350 minimum. 1500 would reflect reality imo...
Awesome performance for Google. We’ll be soon over $1300. Google’s AD numbers Sets up well too for FB on Wednesday too.

"OPTION TRADERS took advantage of the huge discount on those June 18th/July 16th Calls when GOOG was near $2300. Those calls are up big, and will be worth massive gains when GGOG is trading much higher.GOOG still sitting under $2400 with pp targets to $2800-$3,000. Take advantage of the huge discount on those calls, before GOOG is trading much higher IMO."

"Google. I love the company. So Great. But I’ve had no desire to be invested in it since not long after Facebook’s IPO. Google, for awhile, WAS “the internet”. Facebook has been taking that mantel from Google gradually over the last few years. I just found out that in the philippines, Facebook actually is the internet.Google’s shares fell and dragged Facebook’s down with them. But their spending increase was largely due to investments in “future growth” that Facebook does not have to make and probably is not making. For some reason, the market thought that Google’s spending relates for Facebook’s. Facebook is hiring 20k new Indian workers at perhaps $5k/year each. That’s $100m. A rounding error on their *increase* in earnings this quarter. There is no comparison.Sad as it is to admit, $GOOGL is the new Microsoft - a one trick pony resting on its laurels that might finally grow after its myopic founders get out of its way.FB on the other hand is not even close to peak earnings, and it has at least 2 years before a Democrat president could spearhead any significant antitrust or other regulation.In a year, FB should be $250+. Heck, it should be there tomorrow. Let’s see."
"Airbnb Says Google's Competing Travel Sites Push Its Listings Down in Search Results • Airbnb, in its S-1 filing, wrote that it believes its search results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads. • The company's public comments follow several other travel executives' who allege Google favors its own products in its Search results. • Google faces a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleges it uses its search monopoly unfairly to suppress competition.Airbnb says Google's search business has prevented the home-sharing company from reaping internet traffic, according to documents the company filed as it prepares to sell shares to the public. Airbnb allows users to book short-term rentals and experiences while traveling. Under the ""Risk Factors"" in Airbnb's S-1 filing, the company said Google has favored its own products over the company's, resulting in fewer online visitors to its website. In the last year, the Alphabet company has added more search features akin to travel websites, including for vacation rentals.""We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google,"" the prospectus states.Airbnb explains SEO, or search engine optimization, as the practice of tailoring content to appear more prominently in search results without paying for placement.We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO,"" the prospectus states. ""SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform's content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform.""The company warns that continued problems with search rankings could force it to spend more on marketing.""To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.""The Justice Department filed its long-expected antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet last month, alleging the company has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in search by cutting off rivals from key distribution channels. Alphabet rebutted the argument, saying it has plenty of competitors and that its services help consumers.Airbnb and Alphabet have one mutual board member, Ann Mather.Airbnb's statements follow other travel executives who have criticized Google's effect on the travel industry. TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer, a longtime critic of Google, told CNBC last month that he welcomes the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit against the Alphabet search unit, saying the company uses ""its dominance in internet gatekeeping at the expense of other businesses.""Expedia CEO Peter Kern also recently said, ""We have no axe to grind against Google, except that we don't think the marketplace is equitable."""

"Prime Minister's meeting with Google 'constructive' but he isn't backing downAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has touted his meeting with the global head of Google's parent company Alphabet regarding the News Media Bargaining Code as ""constructive"".""I thought it was a constructive meeting,"" Morrison said during a press conference on Thursday afternoon. ""I have been able to send them the best possible signals that should give them a great encouragement to engage with the process and conclude the arrangements we'd like to see them conclude with the various news media organisations in Australia.""And that is the best way to enable that matter to be settled.""Google, alongside Facebook, has been engaged in a stoush with the ACCC since August over the code making its way to law in Australia. Morrison said he and Sundar Pichai discussed some of the specifics of the elements contained within the code.“They raised those matters, I think, very respectfully,"" he said. ""But I think we have been able to get that into a much more positive space about the ability to continue to provide services here in Australia.""But at the end of the day, they understand that Australia sets the rules for how these things operate. And I was very clear about how I saw this playing out.""Morrison and his army of ministers have this week touted Microsoft's Bing as the answer to the Google-sized hole that would be left if it did, in fact, pull the plug.Appearing at the National Press Club on Monday, Morrison said he was confident Australians would be left with sufficient alternatives if Google moved ahead with its threat, pointing to a meeting he had with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Shortly after, Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts Paul Fletcher also rallied behind Bing, saying that in the event Google left, he expected to see investment from other players in the local market.Microsoft president Brad Smith on Wednesday threw his support behind the code, saying also his company is committed to Australia and its news publishers. And on Thursday morning, Nadella said it was important that technology companies engage and support the press, as they are an important part of democracy. Morrison said he supports the remarks made by the Microsoft CEO."

Most of the earnings were due to investments not quality earnings and the trend is against companies that gather and use personal data even though it can be helpful in many cases there are risks that people are starting to realize making this stock much less of a darling and it has a high price to earnings level ie expensive so slowing potential future growth is being factored in by the pros as they hype the stock with the headlines..
"Apparently, this puppy was priced to perfection. At least so far it’s not doing a FB. I felt given it’s diverse revenue base (services and hardware) there could be some forgiveness or flexibility on results.

Why Google struggles so much?
"Youtube, Search advertising, Cloud all cyclinders firing this quarter will be great to watch. Google has grown revenue along with EPS which is impressive. Strength in AI, ML research, will be a key strength for Google long term."

"Gonna get out before the correction, no worries ill be back after the dip"
"The gap down, from 1170 to 1120, a big, 50 point gap, we will be looking for that to fill. I guess the idea is to sit patiently on your hands for a few days or a week until it looks like it wants to enter into that gap. When it does, put on the afterburners. Push those chips into the pot. Lots of call buying, right then. Google would have sold off even if it met guidance. They wanted a big beat to take it higher due to aggressive positions and when they didn't get it, they had to sell. The fact is, the earnings report was very, very good. Lots of growth. Huge profitability. Pristine balance sheet, etc, etc, etc. Google does not give forward guidance. They talked about a one time charge due to repatriation but they said nothing about the effects of the new lower tax rate going forward. In my view, the tax cut is not yet priced in. 1245 was an easy target before the earnings ""miss"". Now maybe we are shooting for 1200. Either way, it doesn't matter. That gap will fill. The manipulators will hold it down for a few more days boys, and then be ready to rock and roll. This thing is going higher. Put in your price alerts and have your money ready. When it pushes into that gap, it's not going to wait for you. It could close in one day."
"IF this breaks 2400, it is still met with resistance at every level 2405, 2410, etc. So let's hope there's a LOT of buying power :)"

Youtube will increase user time spent, Waymo will continue to be #1 in AI driving, Android will continue to sell phone to the over 1.5 billion without phones, and Googles ads overall will go up in costbest of luck to everyone, I wouldn't try to call a bottom, I would just start buying and stretch your money to buy every couple days/months/years!"

Fellow alphabet investors and others. I would like to share my humble opinion.... Alphabet is nothing if not a very well funded and one of if not the world's biggest disruption laboratory. Look how android phones have changed the entire world with countless applications. Compare with Tesla another disruptor for a moment. Alphabet has huge revenue and great earnings growth and a low PE in contrast... Earnings miss So what… they plowed some extra unplanned cash into their and our rapidly evolving future. Have made major investments in AI block chain autonomous automobiles cloud fiber data center many secret projects. Staying long and strong. Please comment.

"Sen. Amy Klobuchar Introduces Competition & Antitrust Bill; Turns Up Heat On Facebook, GoogleU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has formally introduced legislation to strengthen antitrust laws and restore competition to American markets. The Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act “will give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen prohibitions on anticompetitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement,” her office said Thursday.Former Democratic presidential contender Klobuchar is the lead Dem on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights. The move, which had been anticipated, turns up the heat on big social media and tech companies like Facebook and Google. Late last year, the FTC and 48 attorneys general filed antitrust suits against Facebook, alleging the company quashes competition, including by buying up smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp. Google is the target of three suits by a combination of state attorneys general and the DOJ for its dominance in search.“Competition and effective antitrust enforcement are critical to protecting workers and consumers, spurring innovation, and promoting economic equity. While the United States once had some of the most effective antitrust laws in the world, our economy today faces a massive competition problem. We can no longer sweep this issue under the rug and hope our existing laws are adequate,” said Senator Klobuchar. She called the legislation the first step to overhauling and modernizing our laws so we can effectively promote competition and protect American consumers.”The bill is cosponsored by Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust and Commerce Committee members Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Brian Schatz (D-HI). It calls for increased enforcement resources, strengthening prohibitions against anticompetitive mergers and putting the burden of proof on companies, updating legal standards for mergers and cracking down on “harmful dominant-firm conduct.”Since 2008, the bill says, U.S. firms “have engaged in over $10,000,000,000,000 in mergers and acquisitions. The acquisition of nascent or potential rivals by dominant firms can present significant long term threats to competition and innovation; the acquisition, by one of its competitors, of a maverick firm that plays a disruptive role in the market–by using an innovative business model or technology, offering lower prices or new, different products or services products, or by other means that benefit consumers—can present a threat to competition.”"
"I trimmed GOOG holdings to buy NLST shares after reading about this patent infringement case. Outrageous, criminal behavior and I am embarrassed to own GOOG shares so will continue trimming until ALL GOOG shares no longer pollute my portfolio and NLST grows. I wish the folks at NLST good luck with settlement talks and a steady rise in share price both short and long term. If the level of criminality is allowed to continue the way GOOG preyed on NLST IP 912, HMD/HMD2 the laws don't mean anything, the courts don't mean anything and this country is over. I am sure GOOG will try and worm their way out of this somehow even though it looks like they are cornered with no options legally but slime like this always figures out a way to lower the bar further and to expect GOOG to do the right thing is delusional because they don't know what that is. The court will force the settlement and that's good news because if it gets to that point then the court will hammer GOOG. GLTA NLST holders. Proud to be among you. Happy 4th!"

Does google hit $1100 or $950 first?
earning will boost the stock over 1300? I think so.
GOOG has not even realized its stock potential. It’s at the same price it was 6 months ago at $1500 when it topped. This is going to $1700 and it won’t be after earnings but it will get there. They should be able to blow the doors off of earnings despite their appetite for spending
"Wow, demolished expected EPS. 2400 eow for sure."
See you at 3 digit
It will end the day with 5% too many uncertainties. No reason for the company to grow $60 billions in one day. It’s a single qtr not whole year. Last qtr FB jumped as mu h as 9% and then next few days gave it away
It dropped exactly 100 from last night's high of 1115 !!!!!

"Justice Department gives judge big Google document requestWASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Justice Department asked the judge hearing its antitrust fight with Alphabet's Google for a huge list of documents from the search and advertising giant, including some about Facebook and Google's Chrome browser, according to a court filing on Wednesday.Among the documents requested was communications with third parties regarding ""any form of cooperation in responding to antitrust investigations or litigation, including communications with Facebook regarding 'Jedi Blue.'""A group of states led by Texas had alleged that Google and Facebook, the two biggest players in online advertising, used a series of deals to consolidate their market power. But the issue was not included in the federal complaint against Google.Google objected to the document demand, and others, as ""overly broad"" and potentially privileged but said it was willing to discuss the matter.The documents are requested as part of a pre-trial process for a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit, filed in October, focused on Google's search and search advertising, and a broader state case, which was filed in December. Google has denied wrongdoing in each.Other documents requested by the government included internal Google communications regarding the government investigation and lawsuit; documents dating back to 2000 regarding Google's search engine and how it compares to competitors and documents going back to 2005 regarding the Chrome browser. Google objected to at least portions of each of those document requests.Other of the more than 60 document demands, which Google objected to at least partially, included documents discussing Google's funding of think tanks, or specific academic projects, documents related to the removal of an app from the Play Store and its later restoration."

"Market Morning: Alphabet, JD Ignore Trade War, Oil Down on OPEC SpatAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) doesn’t seem to share President Trump’s enthusiasm for making it hard for Chinese companies to sell to American consumers, as it has decided to partner with Chinese retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to the tune of $550 million in an effort to battle Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), a fellow domestic American company. Perhaps the Trump administration will decide to prosecute Google for partnering with a foreign firm for the purpose of fending off competition from a domestic one, which may endanger national security somehow. For its part, JD is trying to fend off competition from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) which, although being a Chinese company, has an Arabic name. Perhaps the Xi administration will prosecute JD for partnering with a foreign firm for the purpose of fending off competition from a domestic one. What is the deal with all these partnerships across international lines anyway? Can’t we all just stop getting along and focus on the trade war? National security is at stake.

We need a 7 for 1 or 10 for 1 split badly. When Apple did their 7 for 1 the stock rocked 175 x 7 = 1225. I do believe this would be stuck around 1000 if they hadn't done that. AAPL was 700 at the time and moved to 1225 pre split 525 point move so it works well to let more small investors buy in.

"Drugs for Sale Plague Social Media PlatformsWASHINGTON, March 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Social media platforms continue to have difficulty removing illegal offers of opioids, steroids and COVID-19 ""vaccines."" Even after they have been alerted of specific posts and long past when they have made public pledges to do a better job of making their services safe for U.S. consumers, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Telegram are not backing their words with action, new research from the Digital Citizens Alliance (Digital Citizens) and the Coalition for a Safer Web (CSW) shows.The Digital Weeds 2021 report revisited past research conducted by Digital Citizens and CSW to determine if social media platforms have truly addressed illicit activity that was brought to their attention. Researchers searched for old posts and previous users who were attempting to conduct illegal activity. In some cases, the research teams found accounts and similar posts from the same users, whose posts were taken down years earlier, still up on the platforms. In some cases, the research teams found current accounts and similar posts from the same users who were identified years earlier.In addition, researchers also found that the fraudulent sale of COVID-19 vaccines, which was identified by DCA and CSW in February, remains despite calls for action by Facebook's Advisory Board to address COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and related dangers.""I find it amazing that the platforms have the ability to pinpoint a 47-year-old resident of Walla Walla, Washington who might be interested in buying retro-styled, minor league baseball caps from teams of the 1950s, but can't figure out a way to stop the posts pushing illegal and/or illicit activities on their pages,"" said Digital Citizens Alliance Executive Director Tom Galvin. ""The platforms have had a chance to correct this problem. How much more evidence do we need to present before lawmakers say, 'enough is enough' and take the action the platforms themselves have not been able to take?""Both Google and Facebook, once enormously popular, respected companies, are increasingly questioned by consumers as well as federal and state regulators for their business practices. But a lot remains the same: • Criminal activity and/or illicit activity highlighted in previous research, such as the selling of opioids, steroids, and malware, can still be found easily today. • Many videos and posts shared in prior DCA and CSW reports and/or with media contacts are still available across numerous social media platforms. • The platforms still have advertising from premium, respected brands running next to videos and/or posts for illegal and/or illicit item. • The platforms allow for communication between drug pushers and potential buyers. Whether by containing phone numbers and emails in videos and/or posts or allowing for conversations to happen in chats. • The platforms' algorithms amplify connectivity between potential buyers and sellers of illegal and/or illicit items. Researchers, acting as potential buyers looking for drugs, showed that when they look for drugs on Instagram, Instagram will in turn begin directing drug sellers back to the potential buyer. • When outed by media outlets, platforms will often take down specific videos mentioned by reporters, but not address the larger problem. This leaves consumers vulnerable to similar, or sometimes even the same scams, that inspired the news coverage in the first place.Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, President of the Coalition for a Safer Web, added: ""Our report is another abject proofpoint that so long as social media companies are unregulated and left to run wild, consumers will be exposed to the criminal web marketplace opened by extremists and terrorists hawking illicit, dangerous drugs to fund their organizations and operations. Until Congress acts, both the FDA (by issuing formal warning letters prohibiting the sale of illegal drugs) and the FTC (by prohibiting criminal operations on social media companies) must step in immediately to protect the American people?"""
"- Google's Rehearing Request Denied and Smart Modular Patent Litigation Dismissed -IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Netlist, Inc. (NLST) announced today an update on an inter partes reexamination of Netlist's US 7,619,912 (""912"") patent. On January 31, 2019 the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), in response to Google's rehearing request, denied rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of claims in Netlist's '912 patent. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision rejected Google's three main points involving memory modules and the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication. Google began its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent starting in 2010. Netlist believes the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in standards now being established for server memory modules at DDR5.Netlist also noted that on January 22, 2019, patent litigation initiated by Smart Modular Technologies (""Smart Modular"") against Netlist regarding U.S. Patent No. 8,250,295 (""the '295 patent"") was dismissed with prejudice by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. Netlist and Smart Modular jointly agreed to drop claims against one another including counter claims Netlist brought against Smart Modular and the '295 patent."

"Whether valid or not, Damore stepped over the line with his genetic thesis about woman engineers. However, he raised a critical issue of how the Neoliberals are forcing their diversity BS down our throats. What started out as as valid issue has been turned into Orwellian group think nightmare by the storm troopers of the far left.The intent of the original equal opportunity legislation was just that, equal opportunity not forced equal outcomes. Diversity in many ways is no better than the discrimination against blacks during the 1960s. Yet, the Neoliberal press, many of whom have benefited from the diversity dogma, have become the front men for the Neoliberal Nazis, who seek to gain advantages not based on their qualifications, but rather because they are the self proclaimed victims of discrimination that they feel is rampant in our society. Don't burst the militant feminist bubble, but the reason women only represent 20% of the engineering staff is because they only represent 20% of the students enrolled in the engineering colleges, duh! I worked as a physicist and manager for many years in Silicon Valley and elsewhere and I can tell you that companies do everything they can to hire and promote women and miniorities.However to to target white, male engineers for dismissal so a firm can hire women and and people of color is blantent discriminationYet to shame people into silence who raise this issue goes against the precepts of our constitution and raises the aura of the Orwellian groupthink nightmare."

"Web giants must stop cashing in on pension scam misery, say MPsMinisters must force tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft to stop the “immoral” practice of profiting from the £10bn of pension fraud committed by internet scammers, a committee of MPs has urged.Fraudsters use online advertisements, mostly on Google and Facebook to trick people out of their pension funds, according to a report published by the work and pensions select committee, but regulators are “powerless” to hold the internet firms to account.After accepting payment for the ads from criminals, the tech firms then make more money by hosting public warnings about the scams from regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority, the MPs’ report said.“It should not require legislative solutions to deter global firms from benefiting from the proceeds of crime, but unfortunately legislation is clearly needed,” the report says.Although the government is proposing to introduce an online harms bill to parliament later this year, this will focus on child sexual abuse and terrorism, without any mention of the epidemic of internet fraud.During its inquiry, the committee heard evidence from the Pension Scams Industry Group that 40,000 people had been defrauded of £10bn since 2015, with online fraud in general costing £190bn a year.The MPs say internet firms should be covered by legislation that already forces newspapers and broadcasters to vet financial adverts or face legal liability. Stephen Timms, the committee chairman, told the Observer: “These companies should not be taking the crooks’ money and putting up on their platforms the material they provide, then also taking the regulators’ money to warn people about the crooks.”“There does need to be a duty of care in this area, as in child pornography and the other things that are intended to be in the scope of this bill,” Timms went on. “The government’s intention appears to be to exclude financial harms from this bill. I do think it’s really important that this opportunity should be taken.”Fraud accounts for a third of reported crime but less than 1% of police resources are spent on investigating it, Graeme Biggar, the director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee. Enforcement is splintered between the police and seven regulators.The MPs called for a dedicated Pension scams centre to manage an intelligence database and enforce the law.Younger fraud victims often suffer a double whammy of losing their pension funds, then facing large tax bills on the money they have lost, the report says. People who access their pension fund before the age of 55 have to pay charges that can amount to half the value of the fund. Scammers often persuade people there are loopholes, the MPs say, but this is false and HMRC is “unrelenting and uncompromising” when it pursues scam victims for the tax owed.As a result, some victims never report the crime for fear of tax penalties, the report says. The MPs called on HMRC to “show some discretion” and said the law should be changed so tax is taken at source.There was also evidence of “secondary scammers” – fraudsters who stole people’s pensions then targeted their victims again by posing as claims management companies. The bogus firms would cold call victims, offering to help bring a claim against their insurance adviser, ask for a fee up front, then disappear."

"Due to anti-trust issues, Google can not buy any big companies in current environment. So why hoarding 120B in cash? why not start a dividend? The share repurchase largely offset stock based compensation and hence, is not that effective in increasing EPS. Management needs to attract income investors and deploy their cash in the form of dividends. I believe the stock will skyrocket with dividends."

"I recently realized that due to its stock price growth, we now have 18% of our entire family net worth tied up in Google stock.

"If you take the three year regression line and plot it through July of last year (before it was know that tax cuts were going to happen), and then if you extend the line to the right, it brings you to $1022 for GOOGL. If you then assume an 22% increase in earnings, as the result of the tax cut, that brings you to $1242. Based on that, we can see that much, but not all, of the tax cut is priced in. One dollar of pre-tax earnings was worth 65 cents before the tax cut. Same dollar is worth 79 cents after the tax cut. 79 / 65 = 1.22 which is our multiplier. Its an easy analysis and primitive, but if you want to answer the basic question of is the tax cut priced in already, we need some kind of approximate sense of what would be fair value."

More importantly, this IP / trade secrets can be used to connect/combine any type of volatile and nonvolatile memory.The key to the success of an electric car, and one of the most important IP Tesla / their value is their IP in batteries.AI spending has been mostly on software side, but in order for end result products like the driverless cars be mass produced, you will need that AI in a box in the car. Sure, the car will continue to get updates over the air at 5G speed, but the core / the brain has to be in the car.The first company to acquire Netlist's Hybrid Memory IP will gain the similar edge that Tesla has in batteries with regards to electric cars, which will be applied to homes powered by solar/wind thereby unleashing Tesla's true value."

Buy back is a good sign that the company has a direction and wants to clear out all other interests held back by shareholders. Taking control is a positive sign that GOOG wants back at the driver's seat!
Will be a buy around 1500.

"“Do you not realize that when Google brought Netlist to a meeting to look at their amazing technology (they obviously heard about what Netlist was doing), they signed an NDA regarding Netlist's secrets and patents and promised to not disclose them or use them without authorization.But Google turned around and sent Netlist packing and decided it was cheaper to steal and use the technology than to pay Netlist a proper royalty. Legally, that is called willful infringement; and the law says that the infringer will have to pay triple damages for their ill gained profit.What profit you ask? Google has had plenty of profit in the last 10 years. Would you like me to estimate it for you? Even with all their billions in spending on new programs, their net profit was about $35Billion; just this past last year.”"

"My Bull case on Alphabet: SO Alphabet owns Google and everything google owns. They are planning to create a lot of other businesses as well, think about this: If you start a business the most important thing is being on the first page of google, otherwise you don't excist. So alphabet can literally make sure that all their other ventures will be on the first page of Google. They might not do this on purpose because that would be illegal. However, they do now which variables you need to deal with to be at the first page. Alphabet will create a lot of great businesses!"

Probably big plans we aren't hearing about, great position to be in especially if the market goes bad... just buy everyone up!"

"Facebook and Google are profiting from scam ads, new research suggestsFacebook and Google are failing to crack down on paid fraudulent ads placed on their platforms, even after users have reported them, new research shows.Online fraud has skyrocketed over the past year, as scammers capitalized on the widespread lockdowns that have kept people indoors all over the world.Tech giants have come under pressure to take action against nefarious actors with past reports accusing Facebook of having a ""lax approach"" to the issue, while criminals continue to buy and set up fraud ads in a matter of hours.More than a third (34%) of people that reported a scam ad to Google said it was not taken down while just over a quarter (26%) said the same had happened with Facebook, according to a study published by British consumer group Which?.Which gave examples of scammers posting fake ads for discounts at established shoe retailers like Clarks or Russell and Bromley, using their logos and branding. These ads lead to look-a-like websites that steal consumers' financial details. One victim said she paid £85 for a pair of boots, but instead received a pair of cheap sunglasses.The study, of 2,000 adults in the UK, found that while Google was worse at reacting to reported scams, victims were more likely to encounter a fraudulent ad on Facebook in the first place.Around 27% said they had come up against a scam ad on Facebook compared to 19% on Google.Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which?, said the findings showed both Facebook and Google had left their users ""worryingly exposed to scams,"" and suggested the UK government bring in legislation to root out the problem.""Online platforms must be given a legal responsibility to identify, remove and prevent fake and fraudulent content on their sites,"" he said. ""The case for including scams in the Online Safety Bill is overwhelming and the government needs to act now.""As part of the British government's proposed Online Safety Bill, tech companies that allow users to post their own material or talk to others online could be fined up to £18 million (around $25 million) or 10% of their annual revenue, whichever is higher, for failing to remove ""harmful"" content.The Bill is expected to contain extra provisions for the biggest social media companies with ""high-risk features,"" expected to include Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter."

Solid week for GOOGL. I'm very confident that GOOGL will surpass 4Q results. Also do believe that sometime in the future they will begin to pay a dividend of 1-2%.
Alphabet is doing just fine thank you. The stock was in the 700’s just a couple of years ago so pretty nice return for us long term folks. Seems to have formed strong support around 1k so if it drifts down to that level again should be a good time to accumulate more shares for the long term. This company is a beast! the shorts and naysayers come and go so if you are a long term investor just hang in there.

"@Sak From 46.075B to 38.297B that's a 22% drop in revenue. It's not 40% but it's a damn big one. I sold my shares too last week I thought smart money would sell in panic but they know what they are doing they don't want other investors to panic. So you will see a gradual decrease in Google's shares. It will hit 1100-1200 in a few months. Just take a look at google's growth chart. It is now in the minuse side, GUYS minus not 20% not 10% not 30% as it used to be. Growth game is over for google they just can't find new revenue sources and competition game drive their profitability down and down. You don't pay 35PE premium for a stock has no growth potential."
"Google Fires Another Top Researcher on Its AI Ethics TeamGoogle has fired another top artificial intelligence researcher, Margaret Mitchell, in the latest escalation of internal tensions at the company following December’s controversial ouster of Timnit Gebru, a Black AI ethicist. As if the PR fire with Google’s AI ethics team didn’t have enough fuel already.Mitchell, who formerly led the team alongside Gebru, was caught using automated scripts to comb through her work emails to find evidence of discrimination and harassment to back up Gebru’s claims, Axios reports. In January, she lost access to her corporate email after Google launched an investigation into her activity. In a statement to Reuters, Google claims Mitchell’s firing followed disciplinary recommendations by investigators and a review committee. Google said she violated the company’s code of conduct and security policies and transferred electronic files outside the company.Mitchell announced her termination Friday evening in a tweet. When reached for comment by CNN regarding Google’s claims, she told the outlet, “I don’t know about those allegations actually. I mean most of that is news to me.”She joined the company in 2016 as a senior research scientist and founded Google’s AI ethics team with Gebru. In the past few months, Mitchell has been openly critical of Google’s abrupt dismissal of Gebru, one of the few Black employees at the company (just 3.7% of Google’s U.S. staff are Black according to its 2020 annual diversity report). Gebru claims she was fired after raising concerns about the company’s shoddy diversity protocols and its attempt to censor research critical of its products.Gebru’s firing “created a domino effect of trauma for me and the rest of the team, and I believe we are being increasingly punished for that trauma,” Mitchell wrote on Twitter Friday. Another leading AI researcher at the company, Alex Hanna, tweeted a screenshot that evening purportedly of an email she received from higher-ups threatening that she is next on the chopping block.Thousands of Google employees and experts in the AI community protested Google’s decision to fire Gebru, and it’s led to increased scrutiny over the company’s AI ethics research. Now it seems internal tensions have started bubbling over as Google attempts to muzzle dissenters and hurriedly turn the page on the controversy by burying it in a flood of policy changes. Earlier this week, Google announced plans to restructure its responsible AI teams to consolidate leadership under Marian Croak, Google’s VP of engineering. Hours before Mitchell’s firing, Google reportedly sent out an internal email detailing several other new research and diversity policy changes the company’s implementing in the wake of an internal investigation into Gebru’s termination."

"Russia Proposal Threatens to Silence YouTube, Facebook(Bloomberg) -- Russia would be able to restrict access to Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube under a draft law aimed at punishing what backers call is censorship by the U.S. platforms of Russian state-backed media.The draft, submitted Thursday by senior lawmakers from the ruling party would allow prosecutors, in consultation with the Foreign Ministry, to designate foreign Internet platforms as breaching Russians’ rights by restricting content. Penalties would include fines, as well as partial or total limits on access to the platforms in Russia.Since April, Russian media companies have been complaining that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube were censoring their accounts, sponsors of the measure said in documents submitted with the draft law. State-backed news outlets including RT have criticized what they say is censorship by U.S. platforms, which say the measures are part of efforts to fight disinformation.“Discriminatory actions against Russian clients of these services have taken place,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call when asked about the initiative. “This must be countered.” But he stopped short of endorsing restrictions on access, saying appropriate sanctions would be determined in the legislative process."

The ruling came after last week's oral hearing before a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit and pending an appeal granted by the Supreme Court of the U.S., the decision is final and binding on future cases.""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""In response to Netlist's 2009 complaint, Google first filed its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent in 2010 and was later joined in its effort by Inphi and Smart Modular. On January 31, 2019 PTAB denied Google's request for a rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of the '912 patent claims. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision adopted Netlist's positions on the claims and rejected Google's invalidity arguments involving the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication.Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry."

"From Scott (Yahoo Board 2020-06-26)Only option for GOOG now is SCOTUS and that won't happen for two reasons;1. SCOTUS has never reversed a patent infringement case when Fed Court invokes ""affirmed rule 36"" which is a death blow to GOOG in legalese. 15 for 15.2. GOOG does not want the details of how they stole, copied and rebranded 912 technology and then sold it all over the planet.They will settle and settle fast for a huge sum because GOOG lawyers lied to the three Fed judges about their theft and when ordered to open up their servers to NLST to snap photos they get caught. They also challenged NLST patent claims which if simple slimebaggery on a scale , unfortunately, we have all gotten use to. GOOG basically destroyed NLST and that's a ten year, 700 billion dollar story. Damages will be huge, even record setting by magnitude.This is the norm now for Big Tech. Built in to the business model - steal, get caught and settle rather than make a licensing deal and pay out in perpetuity because it's cheaper and people forget quickly about the malfeasance.From Maddasher (2020-06-28) I thought Google's slogan was, ""Do NO harm."" hmmm hypocrites."

"Google Staff Launch Union, Escalating Tension With Leaders(Bloomberg) -- Employees of Google and parent company Alphabet Inc. announced the creation of a union on Monday, escalating years of confrontation between workers and management of the internet giant.The Alphabet Workers Union will collect dues, pay organizing staff and have an elected board of directors. It will be open to all employees and contractors in North America, regardless of their role or classification, and plans to take on issues including compensation and ethical concerns such as the kinds of work Google engages in. More than 200 workers have signed up to join so far, the group said.“A lot of us employees are feeling disempowered, like we don’t have a say in the direction the company is taking anymore,” said Google software engineer Kimberly Wilber, an activist with the new group. “A union is of our way of building power so executives can’t ignore us.”Google has clashed with some employees in recent years over contracts with the military, a plan for a censored search engine in China, the different treatment of contract workers and a rich exit package for an executive ousted for alleged sexual harassment.“We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace,” Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in a statement. “Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”The new union drew support Monday from U.S. lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who wrote, “I’m in this fight with you all the way.”The effort, a rare campaign within a major U.S. technology company, is supported by the Communications Workers of America, which has been pursuing tech-focused organizing through an initiative known as CODE-CWA. Googlers who join the Alphabet Workers Union will also be members of CWA Local 1400. Members will pay 1% of their total compensation in union dues, which will help fund organizing staff.CWA said the new organization isn’t currently focused on securing formal recognition by Alphabet or collective bargaining with the company, a process that has been aggressively resisted by U.S. corporations.“We might need to see some substantial changes in labor law before that’s a realistic goal,” CWA communications director Beth Allen said. If the union can eventually sign up a majority of Alphabet’s workforce, that would be a “powerful statement,” but the group could effect change even without it, she added. CWA’s membership includes some workers, such as public university employees in Tennessee, who engage in collective action while lacking legal collective bargaining rights.U.S. law grants unionization rights to employees but not to independent contractors, and also makes it more difficult for sub-contracted workers employed by staffing agencies to gain the ability to negotiate directly with a company like Alphabet. Such “temps, vendors and contractors,” known as TVCs, outnumbered Alphabet’s direct employees in 2018 for the first time, Bloomberg reported.Union leaders said on Monday it was crucial that these TVC workers be part of the union as well. “We’re not going to make our growth and collective action dependent on labor law,” said Google software engineer Chewy Shaw, who was recently elected vice chair of the new union.Workers involved in the new union said they saw it as an extension of such efforts, one that could provide a more permanent structure to keep pressure on management, hold the company accountable for promised changes and respond to retaliation against activists. The organization plans to deploy a mix of protests and legislative, regulatory and legal tactics, and to weigh in on issues like antitrust scrutiny of Google. CWA in 2018 joined a coalition urging the Federal Trade Commission to break up Facebook.CWA has been working with Google activists since late 2019, and filed a complaint then with the National Labor Relations Board alleging workers were fired for taking collective action. In December, the agency’s general counsel took up some of those allegations, accusing Google of illegally firing, interrogating and surveilling activist employees. Google has denied wrongdoing, saying it supports workers’ rights and that the employees in question were punished for “serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”"

When they contacted Google’s human resources department, each was encouraged to take mental health leave, even when their complaints were unrelated to mental health concerns, according to NBC.The report follows the December firing of Google AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru, who refused a manager’s request to retract a paper that described the dangers of language models like the ones Google relies on to power its search engine. Gebru wrote an email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv describing her frustration over the paper, and mentioned her doubtsabout Google’s commitments to diversity and inclusion. She says Google told her the email was “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Google’s head of AI claimed Gebru resigned, which she has vehemently disputed.And April Christina Curley, a Black woman who worked as a diversity recruiter for Google, said she was fired in September after being denied promotions and having her pay cut, despite her strong work performance and her successful recruitment of hundreds of students from historically Black colleges and universities to Google’s engineering department. Curley told NBC she was also encouraged to take mental health leave."
Any insight on when the timing of the next stock split?
On to $1300. We have our mojo back!
"2340 or so by April next year. I had to settle at 1190 for unrelated reasons, but wish I was still in for the long hold. I will wait for the dip and buy in again. Besides I see GOOG as a long, and that isn't very fun in the trading world. It's lucrative if you can settle in though."

"Two Google engineers resign over firing of AI ethics researcher Timnit GebruSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An engineering director and a software developer have quit Alphabet Inc's Google over the dismissal of AI researcher Timnit Gebru, a sign of the ongoing conflicts at the search giant over diversity and ethics.David Baker, a director focused on user safety, left Google last month after 16 years because Gebru's exit ""extinguished my desire to continue as a Googler,"" he said in a letter seen by Reuters. Baker added, ""We cannot say we believe in diversity, and then ignore the conspicuous absence of many voices from within our walls.""Software engineer Vinesh Kannan said Wednesday on Twitter that he had left the company on Tuesday because Google mistreated Gebru and April Christina Curley, a recruiter who has said she was wrongly fired last year. Both Gebru and Curley identify as Black.""They were wronged,"" Kannan said.Google declined to comment, but pointed to previous statements that it is looking to restore employees' trust after Gebru's departure and that it disputes Curley's accusation.The resignations come as workers have demanded commitments to academic freedom and management change in Google's research organization. More than 800 people joined a union announced last month to advance workplace protections, and more than 2,600 of its 135,000 employees signed a December letter supporting Gebru.Baker, whose resignation letter was shared with an internal affinity group for Black employees, told Reuters he stood by his remarks.Kannan did not have an immediate comment.Gebru, who co-led a team on AI ethics, says she pushed back on orders to pull research that speech technology like Google's could disadvantage marginalized groups. Reuters reported in December that Google had told some staff not to cast its technology in a negative light."

The valuation was around 27-29x forward earnings every time I bought. The valuation to this day is about the same. Hold your nose and buy a few shares."

"OK Google, tell us why your earnings growth is slowing down ... hello? Anyone there?BY MarketWatch— 10:50 AM ET 07/20/2019Alphabet executives avoided discussing growth slowdown in last earnings report, and numbers don't tell much of a story eitherAlphabet Inc.'s (GOOG) growth is slowing, and analysts don't have a clue as to why because executives aren't talking.As Google's (GOOG) parent company (GOOGL) (GOOGL) nears its fiscal second-quarter results on July 25, the chorus of disapproval about its evasive financial-reporting practices has increased on Wall Street. After releasing disappointing first-quarter results in late April (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/alphabet-stock-drops-after-earnings-show- disappointing-google-sales-growth-2019-04-29), executives were vague, if not outright unresponsive, about slowing growth.For more: Google (GOOG) sales growth is slowing, and it sure would be nice to know why (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ google-sales-growth-is-slowing-and-it-sure-would-be-nice-to-know-why-2019-04-29)""We delivered robust growth led by mobile search, YouTube (GOOG), and Cloud with Alphabet revenues of $36.3 billion, up 17% versus last year, or 19% on a constant currency basis,"" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a statement at the time. ""We remain focused on, and excited by, the significant growth opportunities across our businesses.""Deciphering where the revenue fell short was complicated by the way Alphabet structures its segments. There are three major businesses listed on the earnings report: Advertising (which includes search and YouTube (GOOG)); ""Other revenues"" (a mix of hardware, Google Cloud, and its app store); and ""Other Bets"" (a collection of upstart ventures that lose money). That's the extent of the disclosure, which leaves investors in the dark on performance of specific properties like YouTube (GOOG) and Google Cloud.For more: The YouTube (GOOG) and Instagram secret that Google (GOOG) and Facebook don't want you to know (http:// www.marketwatch.com/story/the-youtube-and-instagram-secret-that-google-and-facebook-dont-want-you-to-know-2018-01-26)That wasn't good enough for analysts or investors, who were staring at the slowest sales growth (http:// www.marketwatch.com/story/google-sales-growth-is-slowing-and-it-sure-would-be-nice-to-know-why-2019-04-29) for the online-advertising giant since the fourth quarter of 2015.""A concern for us is the lack of clear communication from management into the cause of the faster-than-expected top- line deceleration,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note, while reducing his price target on Alphabet stock to $1,325 from $1,350. ""The lack of visibility or a clear explanation into the revenue deceleration has left us more cautious than before.""Added Jefferies analyst Brent Thill: ""The continued lack of transparency was troubling to investors."" He maintains a buy rating and price target of $1,450.YouTube (GOOG) might be a culprit, even though Google (GOOG) does not break out revenue for the division despite a suggestion from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it do so.See also:How Google fought the SEC on YouTube (GOOG) revenue disclosure (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sec-wants-to- know-why-google-doesnt-report-youtube-revenue-2018-02-26)Ironically, the long-shot possibility of the Justice Department seeking a breakup of the company -- Big Tech, also including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Facebook Inc. (FB) , are being investigated for antitrust (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/breaking-up-big-tech-is-a-big-task-2019-06-10)-- could force Alphabet's hand.""We believe 'breaking up the FAANGs' will be a key issue during the 2020 presidential election,"" Needham analysts wrote. ""We foresee Alphabet taking action well before any elected official mandates how many pieces they must create.""Absent details, some analysts have speculated on what future businesses can get generate in sales. Google Maps, for example, could rake in nearly $10 billion by fiscal 2023, according to UBS analyst Eric Sheridan. Sheridan believes Alphabet is the best-positioned company to grab a slice of the $650 billion global ad market that caters to local merchants as they skew toward digital services for customers with mobile devices.""Given its family of mobile computing utility and media consumption apps (mobile search, Maps, YouTube (GOOG)), we see Alphabet's competitive position and investments as driving out-sized returns as these secular themes move to the forefront of local ad budget planning,"" Sheridan said in a note in early May.What to expect(https://asset.wsj.net/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_736dfa7c5d2affd9850acc11_embed.html)Earnings: On average, the 39 analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to post earnings of $11.10 a share, down from the $11.33 a share expected at the beginning of the quarter (March 31).

Laughing out loud at all the geniuses that were predicting this to spike up after earning LOLLLLLL
Google is back
"Google violated U.S. labor laws in clampdown on worker organizing, regulator saysOAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint on Wednesday accusing Alphabet Inc's Google of unlawfully monitoring and questioning several workers who were then fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union.The U.S. labor regulator found Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave and terminated them for accessing documents related to how the company polices internal forums, according to the complaint. The agency also found unlawful Google policies for accessing documents and meetings rooms as well as its tactics for investigating employees because all of the efforts were aimed at deterring workplace organizing, the complaint said.At least five people fired after leading efforts to rally colleagues partnered with the Communications Workers of America union to petition the NLRB to challenge Google.One of the fired workers, Laurence Berland, described Wednesday's complaint as significant ""at a time when we're seeing the power of a handful of tech billionaires consolidate control over our lives and our society."""

They have a reasonable PE and are pretty much a Monopoly. Like how they are getting into the cloud business as well. Just picked up one single share at 1237!!

Great quarter. There is ZERO doubt that this closes down less than 3 percent tomorrow
"The after market is definitely negative on the miss. I know these stocks are priced to perfection but it does not justify a pull back of almost $90. It certainly can’t be retail investors like myself. This will be a squeeze tomorrow and many retail investors will be in the hurt. The cross trades between the brokers and large hedge funds will manipulate those with weak fortitudes to cede their positions and since they are playing with their clients moneys and they simply wouldn’t care. The will take them in as much as they can absorb at the lower prices and wait for cooler heads to return and they will then reap the undeserving spreads. Who knows, at the end of the day, it may end up being not much and those with ready cash and exacting minds will be laughing all the way to the bank."

Numbers for GOOG and AMZN were actually good. But the set up is for selling so the good news has been interpreted as being bad. This is really market manipulations at its worst.
"Say you run a department in a company. You have 5 full-time employees. Two of them are very good, work long hours, really deliver new developments, are committed, and provide direction and results far beyond your expectations. Two of the other employees are consistent, get the work done that you ask for, have some troubles, but put in clear effort. The 5th employee comes in late, sometimes is out unexpectedly half the day, and leaves early. He smells of alcohol when he does show up and when he is there he is more often talking about the woman he was with last night or some excuses for why he does not want to have conflicts with people. It is not his choice, he is a victim of inadequate education and lower pay than the others. This 5th guy is constantly using expletives. He spent a month on a moderate project and recommended that a circuit be designed with electrolytic capacitors. The project failed and he caused as he caused a fire in one of the company’s major customer’s cabinets and resulted in the loss the whole account. He steals supplies, weasels out of assignments, misses all deadlines, and only has random ideas which he never fully executes any good ones. Do you favor equality? Give him just as important accounts, assign the others under him just as much, pay him equal bonuses, praise him equally, encourage the others to lend him their car, force them to follow his lead, tell others to work less so that he can feel he is contributing equally, promote and praise him to upper management just as strongly, enable him by buying him more alcohol because that is his favorite, show as much trust and ownership as each of the others? THAT is complete equality. Or do you expect responsibility and sincere effort? I assure you if your company shows complete equality, your company will fail. Sincere effort and responsibility are essential in companies and in society."
"If you would have bought PUT option the last 3 Fridays when GOOGL was green, you could have make 100 times your money just buy trading on Fridays. Today and last two Fridays, you could bought options for $1 and sell it for more than 15 times the same day, Just as it did today."

"There was nothing wrong at all, with that earnings report. I think the initial reaction down is just a knee-jerk reaction from short-term traders. I think that the GOOGL was a little bit over bought, going into earnings. If there's nobody left to buy, it can only go down. it should recover quickly. Maybe not today, but within a week or two for sure."

"Brave became the latest browser to ban Google's new surveillance system (FLoC)Brave, a Chromium-based browser, has removed FLoC, Google's controversial alternative identifier to third-party cookies for tracking users across websites.FLoC, or Federated Learning of Cohorts, has just been released by Google for Chrome as its answer to improving privacy while still delivering targeted ads.""The worst aspect of FLoC is that it materially harms user privacy, under the guise of being privacy-friendly,"" says Brave in a blogpost. FLoC has been been widely criticised by privacy advocates, even though it is an improvement to third-party cookies. The Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) calls it a ""terrible idea"" because now Chrome shares a summary of each user's recent browsing activity with marketers.""A browser with FLoC enabled would collect information about its user's browsing habits, then use that information to assign its user to a ""cohort"" or group,"" writes Bennett Cyphers, an EFF technologist. ""Users with similar browsing habits -- for some definition of ""similar"" -- would be grouped into the same cohort. Each user's browser will share a cohort ID, indicating which group they belong to, with websites and advertisers.""Brave, a privacy-focused browser headed up by Mozilla co-founder and key JavaScript designer, Brendan Eich, says it has removed FLoC from the Nightly version of Brave for the desktop and Android. Brave notes the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as signs that consumers are demanding privacy on the web.""In the face of these trends, it is disappointing to see Google, instead of taking the present opportunity to help design and build a user-first, privacy-first Web, proposing and immediately shipping in Chrome a set of smaller, ad-tech-conserving changes, which explicitly prioritize maintaining the structure of the Web advertising ecosystem as Google sees it,"" Brave says in a blogpost. Brave argues that because the feature does impact user privacy, it should be something that users need to opt-in to. ""Given that FLoC can be harmful for site operators too, we recommend that all sites disable FLoC. In general, any new privacy-risking features on the web should be opt-in,"" Brave says. ""This is a common-sense principle to respect Web users by default. One might wonder why Google isn't making FLoC opt-in. We suspect that Google has made FLoC opt-out (for sites and users) because Google knows that an opt-in, privacy harming system would likely never reach the scale needed to induce advertisers to use it."""

"GOOG will blow off the earnings estimate by at least 15%, the estimate is 10.87-11.5, which I think it is really low, which is good in term of psychologic investing. My number is over 13 dollars because of Your Tube ads revenue and fat profit margin. A lot of analysts concern about the profit margin will be lower because of TAC cost, which I think it is non-sense issue, As long as the earnings growth rate is over 20% and revenue is over 25%, I am happy. GOOG's PE now stands at around 22 for 2018, which is really low for the still-growth stock like GOOG. If FB can bring in the attractive ads revenue, GOOG is even better, plus GOOG does not have the privacy issue much like FB. GOOG just calms down the government attack by GOING TO WASHINGTON, and soothe all the politicians which has NO CLUE about the MOBILE ADS ADVERTISING. GOOG will have mobile ads revenue around 31-35% of the global market share, FB has about 20s%, You Tube is the most money maker, follow by Google Search engine and the monopolize Google MAP. The star is born in the Home Security and audio accessaries. I believe GOOG will eat AMZN's Alexa alive within 3 years. GOOG will use AI to drive NEST,MAX and MINI to push AMZN's out in the future. Don't forget AMZN starts Alexa first and has 3-4 years ahead of GOOG but GOOG catches up so fast, by looking at GOOG's heavily promotion in CES in LAS VEGAS. My market cap for You Tube, Google Search and Google Map should be near 1 trillion dollars. The case closes."
"Mutual funds rebalance by April 30th, including selling or reducing winners. Friday may be disappointing. I am a realistic long-term Long GOOG and AMZN. GLTA"
"I can't believe it at all!!! It is totally ridicilous to see AMD with revolutionary products and good guidance has the fraction of ancient INTC. Market cap of INTC= 220 billion$Market cap of NVDA=85 billion$but ,market cap of AMD=22billion$ ?$INTC $AMD $NVDA $AAPL $GOOG $GOOGL $AMZN $FB"
I personally don't want sell today as I'm more scared of it going up than going down
"Grew up a Kennedy Democrat (civil rights, low taxes, anti communism, ""ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country, Christian), became a Regan Republican (low taxes, anti big government, anti communism, strong military, peace through strength, America is shiny city on the hill, ordinary people can do extraordinary things), and then became an independent during the George Bush, Jr. term as Republican leadership in House and Senate lacked conviction and were poor communicators. Historically, it didn't matter what party you belonged to, or if you were an independent, virtually everyone in America supported FREEDOM OF SPEECH as being sacred and core to our freedoms and democracy. Now we see MSNBC, CNN, Twitter, Facebook, Google/Youtube, Huffington Post, Amazon, Apple and other extremist leftwing media outlets routinely censoring conservatives, pro capitalists, pro limited government constitutionalists, and those who support rule of law and border enforcement. Yet these same groups NEVER called for censorship of Antifa and Black Lives Matter as they were burning federal buildings, tearing down statues, breaking into businesses and looting, burning police cars, assaulting and killing anyone that disagreed with them including police. In fact, many of them actually donated money to these terrorist groups. Never in my wildest imagination did I ever think censorship and funding of marxist anti American groups would become the norm in America, or should I now say AmeriKa!"
Cant seem to understand why the bashing here. You get the berkshire of tech when u own this. Secular and cyclical growth. Spin off potentials etc
"Most get rich quick schemes don't work for a number of reasons. They are either:* Too risky* An outright scam* Based on faulty logic like stock picking.Firstly I will recommend COINGROWTH Cryptocurrency Investment Platform COINGROWTH.ORG the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.You have to remember something. Information is available freely and easily these days.So no matter how much research you do, there are millions of others looking at the same data.So it is highly unlikely you have found an untapped niche. For example, buying a house for $50,000 in a developing market sounds cheap and is cheap. It probably isn't a scam either.There again, why is the house only 50k? It is that price because the market, including loads of institutional investors, have decided it is a fair price given the risk involved.The only get rich quick ideas I have seen work are:a) Illegal.b). Based on luck. If so, most people don't realize it is down to luck, so end up losing it down the road.c). Based on years of hard work. In the case of businesses, I have seen several people work for 5–15 years in a domain (like recruiting, property, law, finance or whatever), who then start their own business. As they don't really need to build up the business assuming their clients trust them and will follow them, it is fairly easy to make revenue quickly.Simple example. A wealth manger has 10million assets under management. Fees are 1%. So 100k. Split 50%-50%, so 50k each. Plus 20k from insurance, so an extra 10k. So 120k total revenue, but 60k in the pocket.If that advisor starts his or her own firm, it is pretty easy for him or her to make 100–120k in year 1, because they could work from their office at home. It depends obviously on any NDA agreements, local laws on insurance and so on. It also depends on the country. Some highly regulated countries are strict on taking clients with you."
no longer own this stock and will look into my mutual funds and possibly move those around if the hold google.

"Google, Apple, or Amazon needs to acquire SiriusXM to become the dominant leader in automobile media entertainment & technology. Whichever big tech company realizes this first, will become the defacto source for on-demand and live audio streaming on mobile and in the home. Everyone thinks that mobile device options will integrate into the car and will take over the automobile. It's the other way around, the standard platform tied to the auto will become the defacto source for mobile (and the home). SiriusXM has a great position but they don't have the resources and reputation like Google, Apple, or Amazon to make it happen. They also don't have an underlying OS that can take over the technology of the automobile like Google or Apple. When held hostage behind the wheel of your car everyday, ""hey Siri"", ""Alexa"", and ""ok google"" should be the permanent passenger with you as there is no place you need them more than your car! ""Ok Google turn on my bright lights"", ""Ok Google turn on Pearl Jam Radio"", ""Ok Google read my text from Helene"", ""Ok Google navigate to my house"", ""Ok Google find a Jimmy Johns along my route home"", etc... When will these companies realize the value of SiriusXM and make a move to acquire them? Owning SiriusXM will catapult any one of these big tech companies right into the driver's seat!

"Any opinion on this regarding NLST?IRVINE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 16, 2020 / Netlist, Inc. (OTCQX:NLST) announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (PTAB) decision upholding the validity of Netlist's U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent. The ruling came after last week's oral hearing before a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit and pending an appeal granted by the Supreme Court of the U.S., the decision is final and binding on future cases.""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent."""

"I own both googl and baba. I'm very happy with the results from both companies, but I feel baba is severely undervalued. They're already making money on the cloud and their p/e is ridiculously cheap. If they can resolve their issues with the government, they should rally at least 20%, so I'm adding more after the sell off today."
Call will send to $1230s
Netlist family don't be distracted by the dilution that happened over the years caused by Google fraudulent practices.... Our loss has been their gain... The settlement is going to reverse all this loss and dilution!!! We should have been a $50 stock by now and we will be after the settlement!!!
got googl for 1162 and next day dropped to 1135 and still strulling to reach 1162. should i sell for the loss or wait and see

"I’d say all Goog’s “woke” union members need to spend a little time thinking about whether their politics align with their wants and needs. Cuban and Venezuelan wages are now a tiny fraction of what they were pre-Socialism, and the average wage in China is a tiny fraction of the average wage in the US — prior to total Democratic control by Warnock, Ossoff and friends. Goog union members and other wokesters mighneed to watch out for what they’re wishing for. . ."
So tempted to buy but I am sitting on the sidelines until this stops
"For those. advocating splits, it doesn't matter since you can now buy fractional shares on all the major platforms. So dive in!"
I must say i don’t understand what the netlist question is all about. What i see financially speaking is that the market cap of netlist doubled to 78 M$ when people are talking here about a 15 B$ deal... So this looks to me like the classic speculative and extreme reactions of yahoo forums... But frankly i am ready to get instructed

Looking for a quick takeoff here.....
"My thought is that when businesses will normalise in 2021/2022 they will be increasing their budget on advertising, that's when I expect Google is going to increase profits. I think now the business model is not bad, but it will trade sideways for a while.. 1350 low 1700 high.. box is my expectation."

Good stock
"Planning on holding this stock for the longggggg term, already been over a year. I'd like for it to dip so I can keep loading the boat!"
"Ad spending will be cut badly ok. But unlike other companies goog will likely remain profitable over each quarter. Think about airlines or restaurants for example, these businesses have huge industrial risks. Goog has 120 BILLIONS in cash and expect them to buy a bunch of sold out assets. This is maybe the most powerful company in the history of capitalism and each fall in the share price will be the time to reload.PS: This afternoon i watched the movie “knives out” and the actors referred to goog two times... most people won’t even notice it and this means that this company is deeply intricated in everybody’s life. Like coke 50 years ago"
Straight down since Friday morning. Are there any well thought out explanations as to why?

"They beat earnings next week. I don't see how they couldn't. It is just a questions of by how much. The AVG EPS estimate is $11.18. Last quarter, the worst quarter of the pandemic, they delivered EPS of $10.13. Analyst are down right conservative if they only expect a 10% Q/Q EPS increase. I think earnings in the 3Q will increase by 20% to $12.15, beating the EPS estimates by 8.6%. PLUS a great guidance consider Google has received an enormous share of the record campaign advertising dollars. For those not aware, campaigns spent about $7B in 2016 and are on track to spend close to $11B in 2020. This Q3 will solidify a FULL recovery for GOOGL and massive set up for the future. The multiple $1800+ PT's are going to be revised upwards over the next few months and the stock will follow."
What is the difference between GOOG and GOOGL. I understand they may be listed on different exchanges. Are they the same company (Google)?
"85% of Google’s revenue proves Google is still a one trick advertising company that relies on snatching users data, tracking users activities illegally, generating fake news and fake clicks thru their malware bots. Google also distributes toxic contents that are harmful to kids. And yet, they get away with their cybercrimes by bribing the law makers. The big risk for investors is regulations against their illegal business practices and EU is already doing that!"
"High five to all that made money during the pump! (Made $1,050 today)"
Unfortunately there’s some profit taking today after Google’s huge run up this week. Down day for the market. Let’s see if google can turn it around later?

"Of course it dropped like a rock. Pixel sales are weak because in my personal experience, they AVOiID supporting warranty with obnoxious tactics. It's not the device price, it's the notion of premium pricing and POOR customer service. My challenge was unloading too much Google stock before this and I was lucky and sold it during the recent run up. Until GOOGLE acts like AAPL on the customer service, I don't expect anything better unless they get out of the retail market aspect of the business."
In 6 weeks (May 1st) GOOG will report earnings- I expect will be up 20+% YOY......
I love the fake conservative outrage considering they have just packed the supereme court.
"I think it’s time to spin-off the YouTube business. They can’t keep censoring major political personalities and not expect any blowback. Only, this blowback will come in the form of competing platforms. Probably best to cash-in before the viewer dilution."

Remember when GOOGL was priced higher than AMZN? I don't know which of these 2 things I want more: GOOGL overtaking AMZN or GOOGL having a reasonable PE.

Canada said last November it intended to impose a tax on corporations providing digital services from 2022.Ottawa said the levy would stay in place until major nations come up with a coordinated approach on taxing digital giants."

"Alphabet always has haters, since day 1. Can't remember all the reasons they had for hating this stock. Some haters are Occupy Wall Streeter group that hate all stocks. My daughter bought 1 shr. of GOOG for 390 and now has 2 shrs. GOOGL worth 3740."
"Recent survey revealed 79% considered Impeachment was worth it, only 21% considered the Impeachment a waste of time. Personally I don't get it, so I would have been among the 21% voters. Since the ultimate outcome of Impeachment was predetermined by the Senate 66% rule, what did the House Democrats gain by moving forward to impeach Trump? I realize this is not a political board, but its about to get nastier and nastier, which could impact the stock market and our little hiding gem of GOOG. Are you among the 79% and if so, what was gained, why was all this worth it? Final question - do you expect the House will attempt to impeach Trump again before November?"

Most of Google's income is ad-related. Brave also uses blockchain technology. On top of all of the scandals, I wouldn't hold my breathe that Google stock will continue to rise. . ."
"Television analysts/experts have been saying market rotating away from Google, time to sell. Glad I ignored them as always. Sure hope they were short and forced to cover!"
Google stock will be going up. Buy now and reap the profits later
"Google is great investment. Look at Waymo. They just proved how much better they are compared to competitor.Recent Auto Pilot crashes and public driving stop by competitor proved that you can't build such technology in Rush. In other word Waymo is way ahead and their Systematic approach & focus over Quality vs Quantity is much better approach now clearly put them in driver seat for technology. This is not small feat and will help create value for Google for very long term. Other just gambled and hoped data collection & self learning AI can help make decision automatically and so no need for scenario based specific programming to drive safety. You can't rely on self learning AI on everything. While our mind become better as it get experience, Our Mind simply don't work based on data collection or try to memorise everything and decision based on that. and so this is reason, no self learning AI will ever foolproof."
everyone needs to calm down. going to be a great buying opportunity today. Same thing happened last earnings report on February 4th. Was indicated to get slammed at the opening. And in fact it did open down about 25 points. By the end of the day it was up $10 on February 5th. everything's going to be alright

it was bad enough that they stole netlist patent but now we find out that they are a communist organization who believes in censorship. By the way netlist the re-examination certificate has already went to publishing so it will be out soon and they had 78 patent claims upheld against Google who knowingly and willfully infringed those patents for the last 12 years. It's going to be a massive damage award!Buy Netlist to offset your Google losses. Thank me later.

Google asked for mediation in regard to Litigation with Netlist March 25th over Netlists patent they infringed. The 912 patent was fully validated at Federal Appeals Court last year on June 15th. How much will the settlement be? 12 years of willful infringement has a hefty price tag. Probably wise to pursue the mediation under the ADL. Come on Google lets get this behind us. Pay and move forward.

GOOG is the best choice to become $ 1 trillion dollars company within next year.
Losing steam. Probably will close at $1130 or $1125. The latter is a better round number.
It gave up only yesterday's gain. Will recover and move north of 1300 in a few days.

There is no good reason GOOG stock today behaves like this morning. I guess that Jay Powell will stay put the rate and increases more patient than any time because he knows that he screws the market several trillions in the last 6 months. FB will blow up the earnings estimate, set up the moment of truth for GOOG that will blow up the estimate. I guess that GOOG has a good chance to hit 1150 really easy."

Solid quarter. Probably flat to down tomorrow but breakout over 1300 coming soon. Goog is must own stock over next 10 years.

Just dont let the gllomers scare you away and steel your shares. Just my opinion Good Luck To All !!!!!!"

"Judge in Google Case Disturbed That Even ‘Incognito’ Users Are Tracked(Bloomberg) -- When Google users browse in “Incognito” mode, just how hidden is their activity?The Alphabet Inc. unit says activating the stealth mode in Chrome, or “private browsing” in other browsers, means the company won’t “remember your activity.” But a judge with a history of taking Silicon Valley giants to task about their data collection raised doubts Thursday about whether Google is being as forthright as it needs to be about the personal information it’s collecting from users.At a hearing Thursday in San Jose, California, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said she’s “disturbed” by Google’s data collection practices in a class-action lawsuit that describes the company’s private browsing promises as a “ruse” and seeks $5,000 in damages for each of the millions of people whose privacy has been compromised since June of 2016.Weighing Google’s attempt to get the suit dismissed, Koh said she finds it “unusual” that the company would make the “extra effort” of data collection if it doesn’t use the information to build user profiles or targeted advertising.Google has become a target antitrust complaints in the last year filed by state and federal officials -- as well as businesses -- accusing it of abusing its dominance in digital advertising and online search. Koh has a deeper history with the company as a vocal critic of its privacy policies. She forced Google in one notable case to disclose its scanning of emails to build profiles and target advertising.In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.Andrew Schapiro, a lawyer for Google, argued the company’s privacy policy “expressly discloses” its practices. “The data collection at issue is disclosed,” he said.Another lawyer for Google, Stephen Broome, said website owners who contract with the company to use its analytics or other services are well aware of the data collection described in the suit.Broome’s attempt to downplay the privacy concerns by pointing out that the federal court system’s own website uses Google services ended up backfiring.The judge demanded an explanation “about what exactly Google does,” while voicing concern that visitors to the court’s website are unwittingly disclosing information to the company.“I want a declaration from Google on what information they’re collecting on users to the court’s website, and what that’s used for,” Koh told the company’s lawyers."
"Google (Alphabet) is an amazing stock to buy, in my opinion, for these reasons:1. Strong revenue growth with an expected growth of 23.9% for 20212. Low forward P/E ratio of 26, considering it continues to have double digit revenue growth3. The market for Google search, YouTube and Google Cloud will continue to have strong growth, in my opinion, as Google search seems to be essential in almost every aspect of life. YouTube also continues to produce top quality content for every niche category you can think of and will help eliminate cable in conjunction with Netflix, in my opinion.4. Alphabet’s financial statements are incredible with strong revenue growth 12.77% in 2020 even when it was in a worst-case scenario with lockdowns and reduced advertising budgets. Google’s paid clicks for advertising was up 19% in and impressions were up 15% in 2020. 5. The company is highly profitable and has an incredible balance sheet with $136.7 billion of cash and marketable securities.6. Alphabet stock seems like such a safe investment, in my opinion, compared to many other high flying tech stocks trading at 50+ forward P/E ratios. I sleep very well at night holding Alphabet in my stock portfolio.As with every company, Google stock also has some risks. There is a risk of government intervention on how Google collects and uses its customers data and there is a risk the government may try to break up the company which I believe is unlikely to happen. Check out my full analysis here: https://youtu.be/jQ6s85ZRJSQ"
GOOGL will do better if the management talk less.
Gotta love right wingers getting all angry at a company like google.Right wingers have been fighting on behalf of big business for 200 yrs and now that big business doesnt feel like giving a platform to conspiracy theories all of a sudden they think they are too powerful lolMeanwhile they are trying to get a supreme justice that has benefitted big businesses 100% of the time lol.Google's army of $1000 an hour lawyers will slap around the prosecutors all over the courts.If you want real changes you need more than changing a few laws. You need a new Amendment regarding monopolies.And the chances of that happening are next to none.

"Why is Google making it so easy for scammers? The short answer is “big money”'Don't let your money go to waste! Interest rates are at record lows, it's definitely best to invest.'So says the website best2invest.co.uk. For those with extra cash languishing in savings accounts, it's sound advice, so far.But it goes on. 'We will find the top-performing bonds that show a return of up to 9.5 per cent per annum.'Think that sounds too good to be true? You'd be right. In reality, 1.35 per cent is currently the best rate going, according to Moneyfacts.Full of phoney adsGoogle is reportedly raking in tens of millions of pounds a year by promoting fraudulent or unregulated investments on its search engine.It operates a pay-per-click system that allows unverified firms to compete for a prominent position on online searches.But campaigners say up to 90 per cent of its ads for ISAs (Individual Savings Account) and bonds could be scams.Money Mail has also exposed dozens of other Google scam ads, including everything from copycat insurance, HMRC and DVLA websites to dodgy locksmiths.Two weeks ago we told how online scams had spiralled out of control, with internet firms, police and banks failing to stop hundreds of millions of pounds being lost to fraudsters every year.""This investigation exposes how fraudsters can target and exploit customers with fake content before it gets taken down."", said Gareth Shaw, Which? Last July, Google responded to criticism by introducing a 21-day verification process for businesses promoting financial products.If advertisers fail to prove their legitimacy within this window, they will be given a seven-day notice period before the ad is paused.Firms cannot restart their ads until verification is complete. Google updated this policy in December, allowing it to pause suspicious ads during the verification window.But the City watchdog and campaigners including Which? have called on Google to verify all ads before they go live, because scammers can run riot within weeks.Even though Google paused our fake advert after five days, following a warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), our results show thousands of victims could have been scammed during that time.Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, says: 'People should be able to trust that the adverts they see online are legitimate, especially from a reputable company like Google. However, this investigation exposes how fraudsters can target and exploit customers with fake content before it gets taken down.'"
GOOG is the backbone of our digitized world and will be strong well into the next century. No deep thinking required here.
"to me, Google is a screaming buy right now. As we go towards the earnings announcement, the stock always climbes up $100-150. I am going long, given the low pricepoint right now."

Buy GOOG every time it is down. it is like buy Tesla at the discount.
Very few publicly traded companies with better fundamentals and financials than Google.
"This is only little over $100 from the stock market selloff low, so can't imagine the earnings are going to be so bad to revisit those levels. MM's are pricing in a horrible report it seems. I think its a bargain and if there happens to be a selloff AH, I'm loading up"
Classic GOOGL consolidation post earnings into next release. $2300 by June.
Alphabet awarded contract by Pentagon. Must not be as bad as Alphabet competitors and shorters would have you believe.
Down today because?
Google is going to 1200
Russia needs a better trade deal with USA.
Can’t believe I bought this at 2050 a few days ago. Excellent!!! Holding!! Only 10 shares I’m up like 1800 lmao
GOOG can pop $150 if they announce ER like AMZN and do a dividend. There’s a great chance here
"very promising semiconductor for all network provider, cellphone maker and laptop company.."
Down 200 in 1 measly day and 500 from a high man if u aint bullish here on $amzn let alone $googl $goog i think u r nuts. They are going to bounce quick and hard with no asks after this washout. To be able to do what they do in a world pandemic shows u they are antifragile GREAT american companies worth owning daily especially into the same ole ba fear. Google and amAzon have tons of locked up value not expressed in the stocks as so many incubator businesses. Face it we use these companies daily peter lynch knew $spy
If these guys don't have stellar earnings it should trade down. This strength seems to be largely based on some end of the year Waymo story.
What do you all make of the daily price action? Looks to me like some long term holders are probably just cashing in on the pop. Larger funds probably waiting until after the fed press conference today to throw money around since that often creates some short term dislocations.
"IRVINE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 16, 2020 / Netlist, Inc. (NLST) announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board's (PTAB) decision upholding the validity of Netlist's U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent. The ruling came after last week's oral hearing before a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit and pending an appeal granted by the Supreme Court of the U.S., the decision is final and binding on future cases.""For ten years Netlist has steadfastly opposed Google's misguided campaign to invalidate the ‘912 patent,"" said Netlist's CEO, C.K. Hong. ""We are very pleased that in the end the appellate court made it clear that the claims of this seminal patent are indeed valid and in so doing, further vindicate our decade-long defense of the company's strategic intellectual property. We will now move to lift the stay in the patent infringement lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of CA., in order to recover current and past damages related to the ‘912 patent.""In response to Netlist's 2009 complaint, Google first filed its petition for reexamination of the '912 patent in 2010 and was later joined in its effort by Inphi and Smart Modular. On January 31, 2019 PTAB denied Google's request for a rehearing of the PTAB's previous decision upholding the validity of the '912 patent claims. The PTAB's extensive rehearing decision adopted Netlist's positions on the claims and rejected Google's invalidity arguments involving the specific use of rank-selecting signals for rank multiplication.Netlist believes that the teachings of the '912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry."
"Both FB and TWTR executives testified today, agreeing to keep putting lots of resources and collaborate with the government to prevent fake news, etc etc and their stocks plunged -2% and -5%respectively. On the other hand GOOG did not showed up, congress was ""upset"" about them not being present and GOOG just falls 1%.......IMHO the market simply does not anticipate any major action against GOOG or it does not considered GOOG has incurred in any wrongdoing."
"Want to know the REAL reason Google changed their name to Alphabet? It's because they are telling you outright who REALLY owns them... The ""alphabet"" agencies - CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. You know it's true!"
why goog is down when AMZN is up?
Is there a chance someone like $MSFT $CRM $GOOGL buy $AYX?

"Got lucky with the timing of that $1,630 AMZN after-hours buy yesterday, plan to hold awhile. Since I already own GOOG from a much lower price than we're we are at, saying a small prayer that we don't experience the AMZN initial plunge. Instead, sure would appreciate another total blowout and upward movement to the $1 Trillion market capitalization valuation that I believe Alphabet deserves. GLTA next week."
200 points up for GOOGL after earning
Google getting prepared to settle with Netlist for patent infringement/theft. Anyone not in Netlist (NLST) is crazy. Google along with many others stole patent 912 and Google just lost their appeal. Billions will be owed.
"Lets see: Debt less than 5% of total cash. Total shares in float 600 million +or -. GOOGL has been under pressure for about a year due to ongoing issues. The market may finally see that these ongoing problems is not going to hold the stock down any longer. I doubt at this price, GOOGL is being manipulated. There are hundreds of other stocks being manipulated daily.The value of YouTube alone is worth the price of admission.Except for some major market correction the stock will continue in time."
Going green news well known
"Nice job to %#+#$%$ the bed, Google. All other tech has been solid. You guys bring sewer water to a beer party."
"The title of FANG stock should only be bestowed upon companies that beat earnings consistently with massive cash flow. I like BAANG instead. Boeing, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Google."
I like google's business model but there is not much upside potential and safety margin. I am a buyer at 1200s but not above 1300
I'll buy some at 183.30 today.

"Google Loses Appeal in Google, LLC vs Netlist, Inc"
this is an obvious long term play
Netlist beat Google at federal appeals court on June 15th 2020 which validated Netlists patent and showed that Google has knowingly infringed on Netlists Patent for 10 years. Time is getting short on Googles options. Decision was a rule 36 Judgement in Netlists favor. Googles last option is the Supreme Court. The ruling was non precedential and a case like this is almost impossible to appeal. What options are left for Google? Make a deal with netlist or potentially face Treble damages are probably the only options left.

"This may not be as explosive as amzn or what not, but google makes a ton of money and with the increase in android market share, I see this stock only going up"
I made $25.00 a share on GOOG today.
"CNBC idiots talking about how they should trade the stock over 90 days??? As if any of them have any idea what any stock is going to do next week never mind 90 days. They say it with such confidence, pound their chest when they are correct but never talk about how many times they were wrong. These guys opinions are like throwing a dart. I didn't hear one of them pounding the table to buy any of these companies in December. Instead they were crying about breaking support and dropping even lower - spreading fear. Such dumb investment advice. How about just buying it and leaving it alone."
Stock is worth $350. Over priced.
Google is heavily fined. The stock drops but immediately recovers. This shows confidence among stakeholders.
I cannot believe anyone would sell on those numbers. Not like Google is trading at year highs. SMH
and up
"GOOG is only game in town for mobile ads. revenue, period. GOOG is Johnny Come Late in home security, and home speakers, but GOOG comes in with the full cycles and takes market share from AMZN left and right. I predict that within two years, GOOG will dominate in Home Security because GOOG has advantage in AI. GOOG MAX is a lot better than Alexa. GOOG has AI for more than 5 years which is in advance in every new technology. Google Map wipes out Map Quest with in a few years. You Tube dominates the eye balls more than 1.7 DAUs and MAUs every day. GOOG should have a great year in 2019. I guess GOOG will have at least $ 64 this year."
There is no federal law that obliges Google to disclose data leaks. There should be.

"Since GOOG's revamp of their finance pages, has anyone else switched from relying on Google Finance, to Yahoo Finance? Everything about GOOG finance is more difficult to find, do than it was, and is much easier on Yahoo. Also, the company ""news"" on Google Finance is spam. News items on Yahoo finance are real. I have to believe I'm not the only person who has come to the same conclusion...and that there could be a large loss of eyeballs for Google Finance, and a large pickup for Yahoo finance."
Google will move up 10 percent after earnings like Apple and Amazon
$13.06 vs $10.42 and this is down after hours??
Very cheap Stock on Sale here. 20 P/E unlike AMZN AND NFLX

"Why would anyone sell this when the worst is behind for Google? ad spend has picked up since June, crazy. Good buying opportunity here for sure. Easy money"

Glorious beat! Incredible stock! Thank you Google team. Congrats fellow longs. Let's hope it opens even higher tomorrow.
"I have a buy order in. No idea if this goes lower short term, but the long term outlook is too good to pass up."
Didn't GOOG just lose a major lawsuit against NLST Netlist on their memory cells? Time to pay up for the thievery of the memory cells. Is this the reason GOOGLE discontinued saying that it will not be able to give unlimited storage to photos etc... tis happened right after their last case of appeal was kicked out of the courts. Netlist should own Google for what they did.... the compensation is going to be in the billions if the price is set in Texas which it should be.The monopoly of memory has just been broken by a man named Mr. Hong of Netlist. This is a big deal.https://www.thespectrum.com/story/news/local/mesquite/2021/02/08/pc-periodicals-gmail-and-google-drive-files-could-soon-deleted/4434404001/

Should hear news either tomorrow or Monday.. if the stay is lifted $GOOG $GOOGL is f’d and Netlist sees +$2 easy look at the chart this uptrend will last months before ultimate peak +$8 could see double digits
Amazon has like 5 main businesses. Innovates faster and is more diversified than Google.What will Google do when Amazon disrupts them in search advertising?!!
"Everyone needs to Breath. Google isn't going anywhere and they can talk about FB all they want. Google will still be around when FB isn't. Think about just what Google has and what they do compared to Facebook. If people tire of their social media sites and stop going on, What do they have? What's the favorite search Engine? Were good although todays news will hurt the price for a few days."
"l should have brought this one to jinx it so it won’t be up 100 points. Every stock that l brought, it went down immediately right after. U guys have to thank me be to cancel my buy before the market open. I have it put in at 2307. Right on the money."
"Google is ramping up its efforts to return to China. Earlier this year, the search giant detailed plans to bring its ARCore technology -- which enables augmented reality and virtual reality -- to phones in China and this week that effort went live with its first partner, Xiaomi."

"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Google's use of Oracle's Java development platform to create the Android operating system was not protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, reversing a 2016 jury verdict. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, the incredible shrinking Oracle is now looking to tax the innovation of others. Disgraced Oracle is 5 years behind cloud and proprietary database nobody wants to use anymore. It's hard to change, but sometimes Oracle has to embrace a new world.The incredible shrinking Oracle had previously sought $9 billion in damages. Oracle is seeking royalties for Googles use of some of the Java language, while Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee."
Google is actively censoring any searches regarding 2020 election fraud. I'm sure the Contested Elect is fine with this approach to usher in his illegitimate administration.
"Make no mistake, when they offer a product for free, then you are the product.Google has done a great many things for our society but lately all of google's innovation is coming from acquisitions. This monopoly is hurting the consumers in terms of innovation and the seperation of society.No matter which government comes in power, I see considerable risk in teems of Antitrust in the US and even in EU."

"All in favor of a 50-1 split, hit the thumbs up. Sundar Pichai could be reading."
"Australia’s federal court: Google deceived consumers over data collectionSYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's federal court found Alphabet Inc's Google misled some consumers about personal location data collected through Android mobile devices, the country's competition regulator said on Friday.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it is seeking declarations and penalties from Google, though it did not specify an amount.""This is an important victory for consumers, especially anyone concerned about their privacy online, as the Court’s decision sends a strong message to Google and others that big businesses must not mislead their customers,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement.The case revolves around specific Google settings related to its location data collection, location history and 'web & app activity'.The court found that Google wrongly claimed it could only collect information from the location history setting on user devices between January 2017 and December 2018. (https://bit.ly/3ge5RjX)A setting to control web and application activity, when turned on, also enabled Google to collect, store and use the data and was turned on by default on the devices.Users were not informed that turning off location history but leaving the ""Web & App Activity"" setting on would allow Google to continue to collect data, the court found.The court will need to decide what it considers a breach and how many occurred but the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) quoted the ACCC chairman Rod Simms as saying that the regulator would seek a penalty in the ""many millions"".A Google spokesman said the company was reviewing its options."
It appears everyone is overacting. Panic drives the price down. When the sheep run others make money by buying. Google is a sound and successful company. This should bounce back within the next two weeks. Don’t sell out of panic.
I'm guessing a split now will be coming in April.
"Another failed right-wing publicity stunt: British Royal Mint spokeswoman said: ""We have paused production of the Brexit coin.""Up to 10 million new ""commemorative"" coins were reportedly being made ready for the now questionable 31 October Brexit deadline."

"DOJ likely to file Google antitrust suit with no Democratic supportThe suit, the first major monopolization case in decades, comes as both Republican and Democratic politicians have been berating Google and other massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple about their outsize influence over the U.S. economy and their treatment of competitors.The Justice Department has been negotiating for months with a group of attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia about whether they can combine their separate investigations into a unified complaint against Google over its search engine. A strong backing from Democratic AGs could have helped the case make the transition to a Joe Biden administration if the former vice president wins the White House next month.While some Republican attorneys general have signed onto the Justice Department complaint, others have joined Democratic AGs in a group that is moving ahead with a separate complaint against Google, the people said, speaking anonymously to discuss the ongoing investigations.That bipartisan group of states expects to file an antitrust complaint challenging Google’s search practices at a later date, the people said. That group, led by Democratic attorneys general in Colorado and Iowa along with Nebraska’s Republican attorney general, has expressed concern about what they view as the Justice Department’s narrow approach to the case, the people said. Filing a separate suit would allow more leverage if the DOJ negotiates a settlement with Google they don’t like, they said.The Trump DOJ had hoped to entice Democratic-led states to sign on to the complaint in the hopes of avoiding claims that politics played a part in the suit's filing. Up to now, the Google investigations have proceeded on a bipartisan basis with prosecutors from the Justice Department and nearly every U.S. state.A third antitrust complaint, headed by Texas, that focuses on Google’s power in the advertising technology market is likely to be filed in the coming weeks. That suit has been complicated by bribery and improper influence allegations against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The Justice Department is separately investigating Google’s control in the ad tech industry and could file its own case or join in Texas’s suit.Spokespeople for Google and the Justice Department both declined to comment.The number of states that will sign on to the Justice Department’s search complaint next week is unknown, as are its exact contents. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican leader of the Google probe, however, has said he plans to join the DOJ suit and criticized state leaders who don’t plan to sign on. Landry and attorneys general for eight other Republican-led states met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss the suit last month and are viewed as the most likely candidates to join the DOJ complaint, the people said.The complaint is likely to include allegations that Google has used."

"GOOGL shorts are delusional. They think all these suits, especially the Netlist one, are a major threat to the company. I know I’m going to get tons of thumbs down but I don’t care. This company is only going higher from here not lower. The amount they’d have to pay from these lawsuits should they lose them all put together is a small dent in their $137 billion cash reserves. This is my last post in this discussion because it’s clear the only posts that get any love are these ones where shorts attack the company to try and score brownie points with their friends. I would rather make money than score brownie points, and that means going long GOOGL, not short."
GOOG and its internet architecture truly is the backbone of the digital economy. Only fools would sell here.

"Q2 conference call was VERY DULL, it was a plain audio call, no graphics, no videos, it need it a show, and a showman, it need it excitement, emotion, on new products, Youtube, Waymo, Deep Mind, Android, Cloud, etc. I am not Judging Pichai, he could be very bright, but lacks showmanship and emotion (especially with his english) and help to build a show. he needs to learn from early Buffet, Jobs, Musk. Conference call had to be viral, got only a couple thousand viewers, It unthinkable the company father of viral videos, not been able to produce emotions. Still Google is (or was) one of the greatest companies of the world,, one of the most AI abundant (they have to use it to produce goodness and cash), cash Rich (still they have to put that amount of cash to produce). Still I believe Alphabet will be in the top 10 companies in the world 10, 20 years from now. having said all. I believe this conference call will make google cheaper to invest for a while only."

Longs watching their money evaporate
"One more statistic that proves GOOGL is cheap. When you look at free cash flow their free cash flow for 2020 was roughly 43 billion, current shares outstanding are a mere 300.64 million. That already tells you cash flow per share is going to be a gigantic number and it is, $142 a share. Then we take that number and divide by the current share price to get a free cash flow yield of 6.8 percent, which is incredibly impressive and qualifies as a high rank number. Therefore we can conclude that GOOGL even at these levels trades at a significant discount to fair value. Overall this name is very attractive from both a growth and valuation standpoint. Not to mention their 137 billion in cash may be the largest cash supply of any company in the world. So I reiiterate...what isn't to like about this great company?"
"Just as getting over ~$1067 is little difficult, holing the $1050 is very positive, good chance GOOGL go over the 50 days moving average this week."
"Stock price go up or down, but one thing is clear: Google is the best company in the world. Talking about AI stuff, all other companies including FB, MSFT, just follow what Google is doing. So I'm convinced, Google is a long-term investment, just forget about short term up and down."

tbh theres just no growth left for googl and amazon... why invest in a low risk low reward when there and plenty of better buying opportunities out there
"GOOGL is reporting on Monday instead of Thursdays like in the past. My guess is, they must be reporting great earnings ... companies tend to move up their earnings to the beginning of the week when earnings is good and move towards the end of the week when earnings is bad ... to maximize their gains and minimize their loss.

"Alphabet stock rises after earnings beat, announces $25 billion share repurchase Shares of Google parent company Alphabet rose after the company reported an earnings and revenue beat for its second quarter of 2019. Investors were disappointed last quarter by Google’s decelerating revenue growth. Google now faces the threat of antitrust action as the Department of Justice is reportedly planning to probe the company and announced a separate, broad review of Big Tech.Shares of Google parent company Alphabet rose more than 8% after the company reported earnings for its second quarter of 2019 after the bell on Thursday.Alphabet said its board of directors approved the company to repurchase up to an additional $25 billion of its Class C capital stock.Here are the key numbers: Earnings per share: $14.21 per share, ex-items, vs. $11.30 per share expected, per Refinitiv survey of analysts Revenue: $38.94 billion, vs. $38.15 billion expected, per Refinitiv Traffic acquisition costs: $7.24 billion, vs. $7.27 billion, according to StreetAccount Paid clicks on Google properties from Q2 2018 to Q2 2019: +28% Cost-per-click on Google properties from Q2 2018 to Q2 2019: -11%Alphabet beat analysts’ expectations on revenue and EPS but had even lower traffic acquisition costs (TAC) than analysts were hoping for. The metric represents the payments Google makes to companies like Apple for its search engine to be the default browser on their devices.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/alphabet-q2-2019-earnings.html"

"Google sued for exposing COVID-19 contact tracing data to third partiesA lawsuit has been filed against Google by individuals who used California’s public health COVID-19 contact tracing app, claiming it exposed their data and violated privacy laws.Two individuals who used California’s state public health COVID-19 contact tracing app have filed a lawsuit against its developer, Google, claiming the tool exposes user data and violated their privacy, among other allegations.At the time of the announcement in April 2020, Google provided a detailed plan of its privacy policies that included a requirement of explicit user consent, along with a list of frequently asked questions to reiterate the companies’ privacy policies.Those policies included ensuring the generation of tracking keys linked to the user’s device were randomized, instead of mathematically pulling the data from the user’s private key. The tech companies also pledged to disable the service once the pandemic had been contained.The announcement was met with a host of concerns from a range of privacy stakeholders, particularly around user consent and the heavy reliance on APIs. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) stressed that the apps may not sufficiently protect the personal information of consumers.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court of Northern California in San Jose, alleges the app confirmed those concerns.“Because Google’s implementation of GAEN allows this sensitive contact tracing data to be placed on a device’s system logs and provides dozens or even hundreds of third parties access to these system logs, Google has exposed GAEN participants’ private personal and medical information associated with contact tracing, including notifications to Android device users of their potential exposure to COVID-19,” according to the lawsuit.Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that the app’s use of “rolling proximity identifiers” on devices’ Bluetooth radio is recorded by Google’s GMS records, which “unwittingly expose[d] not only their information to numerous third parties, but also information from unsuspecting GAEN users on other devices (including non-Android devices, such as iPhones) who come within range of them.”Further, the identifiers are maintained along other device identifiers and stored to mobile device system logs, it’s then available to third parties that have access to those logs. And as the exposed information is personally identifiable, the information can be used to trace the identifier back to user identities, locations, and other identifiers.“For those who have reported testing positive, it enables third parties to link that diagnosis back to the particular patient, defeating the purported anonymity Google claims for its service,” the lawsuit claims."

"It's not just a social media problem – how search engines spread misinformationSearch engines are one of society’s primary gateways to information and people, but they are also conduits for misinformation. Similar to problematic social media algorithms, search engines learn to serve you what you and others have clicked on before. Because people are drawn to the sensational, this dance between algorithms and human nature can foster the spread of misinformation.Search engine companies, like most online services, make money not only by selling ads, but also by tracking users and selling their data through real-time bidding on it. People are often led to misinformation by their desire for sensational and entertaining news as well as information that is either controversial or confirms their views. One study found that more popular YouTube videos about diabetes are less likely to have medically valid information than less popular videos on the subject, for instance.Ad-driven search engines, like social media platforms, are designed to reward clicking on enticing links because it helps the search companies boost their business metrics. As a researcher who studies the search and recommendation systems, I and my colleagues show that this dangerous combination of corporate profit motive and individual susceptibility makes the problem difficult to fix.Famous but fake spidersIn 2018, searches for “new deadly spider” spiked on Google following a Facebook post that claimed a new deadly spider killed several people in multiple states. My colleagues and I analyzed the top 100 results from Google search for “new deadly spider” during the first week of this trending query.It turned out this story was fake, but people searching for it were largely exposed to misinformation related to the original fake post. As people continued clicking and sharing that misinformation, Google continued serving those pages at the top of the search results.This pattern of thrilling and unverified stories emerging and people clicking on them continues, with people apparently either being unconcerned with the truth or believing that if a trusted service such as Google Search is showing these stories to them then the stories must be true. More recently, a disproven report claiming China let the coronavirus leak from a lab gained traction on search engines because of this vicious cycle.Questions of Big Tech regulation and self-regulation aside, it’s important for people to understand how these systems work and how they make money. Otherwise market economies and people’s natural inclination to be attracted to eye-catching links will keep the vicious cycle going."

1600 next week .stay tuned ..GOOG has star power
Amazon and google !
"This stock is only 5 percent off its high. The market has spoken. Once people realize that 1.8 10 year is meaningless, goog goes to 2500 in a heartbeat."
I will buy in if it goes down to 200
I see $1300 this week!
EPS of $12.77 beats a $10.86 consensus. Ex-TAC revenue of $31.84B beats a $31.3B consensus.
Tearing it up with YT & Cloud....that is where analysts want to see growth ..huge top line growth ...should see a nice $300 - $400 bump to $2600 range over this q into next earnings. .
Never seen shorters fighting to Drive this done...Hedge FUNDS they over shorted goog and they want to cover with no loss. Dont Play the game and hold your shares
In such a large company new CEO hardly makes a difference besides news considering policies procedures process financials and personnel already put in place. Google will be fine if not better just like Microsoft
MSFT was about the same age when the onslaught of government attacks started. This too shall pass and Alphabet will emerge stronger and more valuable. Remember those who wanted to disparage Google for fake clicks on ads. What a bunch of maroons and they were certainly on the wrong side of the trade. Short term thinkers may win a battle but are certain to lose the war. Google it.
GOOGL is the only big cap company that has zero exposure to China.
This company belong to the Ministry Of Truth.Orwell was ahead of his time in recognizing that the control of information puts way too much power in the hands of people that have never had a real job besides Google.Too bad that we have missed the opportunity to remove all of the 230 protections from you wanna be commies.
Google new AR function: virtual objects are seamlessly embedded and can interact with the real world.
Now is time to sell short
I have never ever made any dime on GOOGL since dual shares coming out!
Way overdone. I think it ends down 4-5% tomorrow
GOING UP $70 TOMORROW
How do people keep buying the Russell 2000 when the PE is 100
"Alphabet will outperm this lockdown quarter and beat est. especially youtube will hit new records in ads. everybody is watching youtube channels like music, food, fitness, stocks etc. this winter! strong buy IMO!"
"No real leadership at Google. Sundar Pichai is hardly convincing as CEO. And Ruth Porat is buying up all commercial real estate in the West Village, arguably the most expensive campus square footage. Google is flailing in cloud services, and has no strategy to catch AWS or Azure."
down 500 points? after bell
"The new Google mapping tool shows cities where they need to plant more trees. LA is the 1st city to pilot a new tool from Google, called Tree Canopy Lab. For more hot stocks like (GOOG) just go to (http://tradingstrategys.com)."
it is only a matter of time before Netlist (NLST) sees over $1.. the 912 patent WIN over $GOOGL is worth over $1 billion alone.. NLST will go up a few 100% more before you regret not buying just look at the chart
"In case any of you have been wondering the following link is the result of the reexamination of the 912 patent litigation between Netlist against Google INPHI that Netlist was victorious on in June of this year. Patent is fully validated with ****78**** claims found patentable(only needed one). Recert will be sent if not already sent and stay will be lifted so Netlist can seek damages against Google and INPHI.

Netflix crashed. Who's next?
"After several years for finding fault with Google viewing my emails, I finally set up new email accounts. Even if you love GOOG, you should be concerned. Try Protomail."
The light lockdowns in france and england are again a BOON for amazon as it has a major presence in europe. $amzn - also a boon for $goog $googl - big tech laughing all the way to bank. Amazon at a major buy point will be 3300 in days
They had some interesting insights about GOOG on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
More Netlist shareholders showing up on the GOOG chat board than Google shareholders. They truly believe Netlist will collect $Billions from Google.
So what if they break up Alphabet. Look what happened when they broke up Standard Oil Company.
Sell while you can!!!
Suppose we draw an analogy with a homocide crime 1 - The accused 'Google' was last seen with the victim just after the murder...2 - The accused denies...3 - Defence requests at the evaluation of DNA found of bodies victim4 - DNA found on bodies victim points to the accused 'Google'...5 - Accused denies... He points to the fact that he is a twin of 3 brothers..6 - Case is stayed... Accused point at brother called 'MetaRam'...7 - Defence accuses brother 'MetaRam' with same DNA..8 - 2 Years scrutiny with brother 'MetaRam' results in brother 'MetaRam' is innocent... Has an alibi was not in the US at the time of crime...9 - Defence again accuses the original accused brother 'Google'...10 - Brother 'Google' now point to brother 'SmartModular'...11 - 2 Years scrutiny with brother 'SmartModular' results in brother 'SmartModular' is innocent... Has an alibi brother 'SmartModular' is Gay and lives in Canada12 - Google appeals and get rules 36...Is Google guilty? What do you think?
"Google will have another massive beat on earnings, stock up 110+ on Monday.Reason we are seeing so many upgrades and targets advancing to 1700"
$75 EPS and with P/E around 30. That is all you need to know about this cash cow.
I think this is going to break out - Plus or minus 35 bucks by Friday - My guess is to the upside - The earnings week was a disaster as regards stock movement - The straddle was close to 70 bucks but the stock barely moved - A big move is very likely next 2 days. Good Luck All!
"Soooo will they start issuing a dividend anytime soon?! In all seriousness, they really should."
Google finally get the surge it deserves. The stock have been undervalued for a while and still is. I’ve been a patient investor for over 7 years now!
Are we going up tomorrow or the market gonna sell off after State of Union tonight?
"Only negative I could find was this: Alphabet's operating profit margin declined sharply, to 22% from 27% a year earlier.I didn't see guidance projection as yet!"
“Dow futures jump 100 points after China and US reportedly agree to remove existing tariffs“
Up to $1290!
"$GOOGL will pay... looks like $NLST might have already applied for lifting the stay order.A look at the 5-year chart suggests, $0.70, $.75 and then smooth sailing till $1.21. If we take that out,... watch out.Yes, its not going to happen this week or even the next week. But for sure, in August.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NLST?p=NLST"
"The stock has been beaten for the last few trading days, what it needs now is recovery 1,325 tomorrow"
$1500 stock so fast it will make your head spin.
2200 and then 7/1 split
"I love how Yahoo rates google as ""under rated"" even after a 5% bump. Yahooo!"
GOOG pay up 3 Billion now or 10-12 Billion later = NLST $$$$$$$$
"It's a top heavy market. There was a significant beat, but people are focusing on the negative - and there certainly is negative. This is a show of perspective. The market is overbought."
Buy before earnings!
Susquehanna raised its PT to $3100
Turning red gg
Today GOOG will surge past 1600 with its juggernaut might on full display.
"An email exchange, not previously reported, underscores how Mr. Stone presented himself to Trump campaign officials: as a conduit of inside information from WikiLeaks, Russia’s chosen repository for documents hacked from Democratic computers. The collusion was real, a crime against democracy."
It's sickens me to see the way YouTube is going. This will only open the door for more competition that does not discriminate against Free speech or free video or simply free opinion.
Earnings beat
1600 friday
$NOK is where the money is made this week. Many people switching to duckduckgo for search engine do to googles political stances and dictatorship to its user's. Buy NOK and make money..... 5G is the future...
"I personally believe that Alphabet is the best/safest long term investment possible. Very diversified, innovative, high profit margins and big growth. Google is in a very dominant position on the Internet and some underestimate its potential. If its leadership does it right, it can blow Shopify and compete aggressively with Amazon. Amazon has few huge warehouse. Google can take advantage of the numerous and closer to clients stores to make a more attractive offer to Amazon. Should Google buy Shopify? I thought so before, but now I think that they would be better developing their own merchant tools instead of paying for the overvalued Shopify stock. Imagine shopping on Google and putting all the items in the same cart, paying once, and Google sends the specific item orders to every store involved, and delivered buy the store employees or Uber (eventually Waymo)! My only worry is that Alphabet leadership stays too much passive and abandon projects, without having a big vision."
Look for $1189 tomorrow
"For the 2nd time ever, it gets over the 1,500 mark. This time, it held the leadWinning streak reaches 4 days. Up 74.45 for the month and 171.66 for the year.Now up 538.57 (55.52%) since hitting 970.11 on Dec. 24, 2018"
You can't go wrong with the company that dominates the internet which is part and parcel of everyone's daily life.

"New investors, don't listen to the clowns on here claiming Google will ""tank"" because advertising has been cut. That was already known going into the quarter (which is why the stock went from $1500 to $1100). Advertising will come back and when it does, Google will have an even wider moat than it already does. Don't overthink investing. Buy good companies at fair prices and let time do its thing. Here are my 10 reasons Google should be in everyone's portfolio.1. Great management2. Great product3. Wide-moat4. Fantastic balance sheet5. Strong growth runway6. Trading at a mere x27 P/E7. Still down 10%+ from it's highs8. Strong customer loyalty9. Diversifying business10.

"breaking: Alphabet price target raised to $1,650 from $1,500 at BairdBaird analyst Colin Sebastian raised the firm's price target on Alphabet (GOOGL) to $1,650 from $1,500 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst's latest checks with agencies and advertisers suggest the gradual recovery in digital ad spending continues, benefiting from high user engagement levels and improving pricing trends. While ""still a far cry from the amazing and historic growth levels"" in e-commerce, the digital ad market likely emerges stronger from the current environment, and Google remains on ""strong footing"" with Search, YouTube and Display, Sebastian tells investors in a research note."
"With such a good earning, why do you worry! Spending on investment, that is for future technology growth. Worth it!!!"
Just picked up 10 shares. $2408. Have to think money keeps rotating into this one after this enormous beat today.
Turmoil on the horizon due to antitrust suit against GOOG. GOOG says in its defense that people prefer its search engine. This could be protracted and set an example for other tech giants.
t's July 8th 2020 and Google still has not paid Netlist for the IP they stole 10 years ago and litigated through the patent court and upheld by the appeals court with a nonprecedential rule 36 judgement in Netlists favor. Time to pay up Google
"Obviously Google disappointed the market and their valuation includes a high growth rate, which always creates the possibility of a sharp dip. Still, their growth in profitability year over year was damn impressive. Tomorrow I will look to pick up a few mid-term calls at the 1200 strike price if the stock trades down to around 1180.(I have no position at this time)"
"I'm not buying this dip, on the chart it show 960 is possibly coming."
Alphabet reached an all time high at 1922.83
"An absolute disaster of an earnings. we will be sub 1000 very shortly, get out of here while you still can.The house of cards is going to fall."
"Google and Apple starting to realize that live media is powerful. On demand media is what the core of the internet is made up of ""information at your fingertips"". Watch in 2020 as Apple makes its push into tv and radio, especially the radio which is so outdated and just waiting for Microsft, Google, or Apple to put their brand on the dashboard of every automobile on the road. Live media is so powerful and yet the internet content giants have yet realized the value of owning the auto radio. It will come soon. Someone will buy siriusxm and use it as a springboard into live media in the auto. The auto is the only place where a consumer cant and shouldn't be interactive but at the same time is held hostage by media. Think about that and the value of the radio and what sirius xm has."
Hopefully amazon won’t drag this down

"One of the factors that can really keep the Alphabet soup afloat is better ad revenue, and one of the most important ways to achieve this is to continue demonetizing as many creators as possible on YouTube. They've been working on it for years, and eventually it may make the YT platform lifeless and absent of significant content (they went after everything from World War I footage to aviation news analysis recently), but in the meantime all the additional retained revenue should pad the bottom line and maybe a nice additional boost to the share price."
GOOG has resumed its uptrend. Double-bottom is in according to the chart. Election year and the whole world working remotely in home-office.
The wind's at its back.
Doesnt make sense not to invest in this company
When is Google going to inform their shareholders that they are in big trouble and they have lost a final ruling on patent 912 that had been going on for over a decade? It's gone cost Google $ billions!!!
1060 by END of the day
"looks like going to 1150 in next 3 days, very strong buy before results, post results should cross 1200 easy"
Just think this time next week Google will be back above its take down price.
DO Google investors even know about the recent loss to Netlist? They blatantly stole Netlists IP 10 years ago. This has been upheld by the patent court through 10 years of appeals and most recently in a 3-0 decision by the Federal appeals court in a rule 36 judgement. If Google has not been up front to their investors about this you might want to ask questions because it could potentially affect your investment. Google could have just paid for the product instead of stealing it and having it bootlegged in China like common criminals. Time for them to do the right thing.
Downgrades tomorrow and goodbye robinhood investors. Thank you for you money.
"In regards to the GOOG/China article out today, if true, do any of you think it could be SOGO with which GOOG is planning a joint venture?Here are some interesting bits from the article (from a SOGO perspective)...1. ""The company is said to plan to operate a joint venture in China with an unnamed local company.""2. ""The company (Google) has opened an AI lab in Beijing."" (Beijing is a big city. Could just be coincidence, but SOGO is headquartered in Beijing and is heavy into AI development.)3. ""....and inked a partnership with Tencent."" (Tencent is the majority owner of SOGO with 42%.)4. ""...and, most recently, its first mini program for Tencent's popular WeChat messaging app."" (SOGO is the exclusive search engine for WeChat.)And possibly the biggest tid bit....5. ""The intercept suggests that these dealings (see 1, 3, and 4 above along with a couple more less SOGO relevant dealings I didn't include here..) are a prelude to introducing Dragonfly in a bid to capture a chunk of the 700 million internet user market that grown quickly since Google's search business left the country..""Is SOGO about to become Google's China branch...??"
"UK consumer watchdog warns on Google fraud adsUK consumers are being tricked into calling premium rate numbers when trying to make an insurance claim, according to consumer group Which?.Which? said in a report on Wednesday that ""click to dial"" ads are appearing above insurers' websites on Google. The group analysed results for common search terms used when looking for car insurers' phone numbers on Google, the default search engine on Android phones and Apple iPhones.Which? found claims management companies (CMCs) and premium-rate call connecting services competing to appear above insurers' own websites.One in five searches (21%) displayed adverts for ""call connecting"" services at the top of the results.Google ranked these fraud adverts above the insurer's number and when consumers click on them they are taken to a website displaying a large phone number and button that says ""click to call."" Consumers are then put through to their insurer, but via a premium-rate phone number.The cost of making these calls can quickly escalate — with a 30-minute phone call costing £112.50 ($157.11) on Sky, £124.50 on Three and £127.50 on Vodafone."

GOOGL is down 2% over the past month while the market is up over 5% in the past month. Reflects the concern of government oversight.
While the cry is that stock is overpriced... I believe its underpriced. GOOG at 1000 is a discount. They are going to earn 40-44 dollars next year. At 25 PE and more than 150 dollars cash they are worth 1150 to 1250.

July 20th 2020 and Google still has not paid Netlist for the IP it stole over 10 years ago. Patent case was affirmed in Netlists favor on June 15th 2020 with a rule 36 Judgement. Treble damages are in play against Google when the stay is lifted. Do No Evil Google

"Advocacy groups urge FTC to be tougher on surveillance giant Google with protecting kids privacy on appsTwo advocacy groups want the Federal Trade Commission to take a tougher stance against Google, accusing its app store of recommending apps that transmit kids' personal information such as location without their parents' consent in violation of a 1998 law that protects children online. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD) said they plan to file a complaint with the FTC Wednesday asking regulators to investigate how the Google Play Store promotes apps for kids.The groups say three recent studies, including one conducted by the American Medical Association last year, found that more than two-thirds of apps – 67% – used by kids age 5 and under were transmitting information to third-party advertisers.""If you’re under 13, your data is not supposed to be shared with advertisers, but that’s happening routinely, and at scale on the apps on Google Play,"" Josh Golin, the CCFC's executive director, told USA TODAY. Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat who authored the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as COPPA, said in a statement that while he's both ""disturbed, but not surprised"" that it remains a problem.""Children are spending an unprecedented amount of time on their devices right now, and they shouldn’t be tracked at every turn,"" Markey said. ""That has to stop. It’s time for Big Tech to be held accountable for prioritizing profits over privacy, particularly when it comes to our children.”Parents have become increasingly concerned about how to keep kids safe on the internet during the pandemic when screens are in such heavy use. In 2019, Google's YouTube agreed to provide new protections for children and paid a $170 million fine to settle a year-long investigation by the FTC and the New York state attorney general into complaints from consumer groups that it illegally collected data from children under the age of 13 children to target advertising.The new complaint comes amid increased government scrutiny of the tech giants. Google faces antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and separate coalitions of states. Concern over Big Tech's effect on children's well-being has also become a rare bipartisan issue on Capitol Hill."
Nice run-up into close. Great sign.
These GOOG bashers wish they owned GOOG.
who sells after hours with -50 or 60 or even -85? I have been buying this drop but just wondering who does this kind of selling.
I bought 25 shares yesterday thinking it was good entry point after the huge drop. Glad I did.
another big tech company reporting the same quarter they have had for two years and their PPS is up 30 percent.
Looking for a 5% jump tomorrow. Repo Liquidity will offset any soft earnings. This is the price for growth.
decided to stay. whatever happens happens :-) good luck to all longs.
"It's going to be interesting to see how the U.S. Justice Department and the EU plan to break up Google's search monopoly. I'm not sure how Google Search can be hobbled. Google will likely have to give up putting their own ad-sponsored results at the top. I don't think most users care how Google manipulates their search results as long as the results are useful. Google will have to modify their search algorithms or stop putting Google Search on smartphones. Meanwhile, Google will keep getting fined until something is changed. Beats me. Anyone can change their search engine if they want to rather easily but the Feds want to make an example of Google as a bully deserving of punishment. I'm not clear on why the EU is whining but I guess they want some payoff, as usual."

"Vote for Trump and keep this engine revving!During her own presidential run, Harris bragged about Co-Sponsoring the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all, decriminalizing illegal border crossings, and gun buybacks.

• GOOG is trading at 10x EBITDA. TEN TIMES. 20x EPS 2019. 17.5x 2019. GOOG is growing earnings by 20%. If they woke up one day and actually cared about their stock their earnings would be up 30%. This stock already gets no love. IT TRADES AT TEN TIMES EBITDA.
"If tomorrow the general market corrects, GOOGL will drop at least 25 points. It is saved by tech rally today. I have the feeling that all FAANG stocks will gap down tomorrow morning."

"US privacy, consumer, competition and civil rights groups urge ban on ‘surveillance advertising’A coalition of organizations across the privacy, antitrust, consumer protection and civil rights spaces has called for a ban on “surveillance advertising”, further amplifying the argument that “big tech’s toxic business model is undermining democracy”.The close to 40-strong coalition behind this latest call to ban “creepy ads” which rely on the mass tracking and profiling of web users in order to target them with behavioral ads. “As leaders across a broad range of issues and industries, we are united in our concern for the safety of our communities and the health of democracy,” they write in the open letter. “Social media giants are eroding our consensus reality and threatening public safety in service of a toxic, extractive business model. That’s why we’re joining forces in an effort to ban surveillance advertising.”The coalition is keen to point out that less toxic non-tracking alternatives (like contextual ads) exist, while arguing that greater transparency and oversight of adtech infrastructure could help clean up a range of linked problems, from junk content and rising conspiracism to ad fraud and denuded digital innovation.“There is no silver bullet to remedy this crisis — and the members of this coalition will continue to pursue a range of different policy approaches, from comprehensive privacy legislation to reforming our antitrust laws and liability standards,” they write. “But here’s one thing we all agree on: It’s time to ban surveillance advertising.”“Big Tech platforms amplify hate, illegal activities, and conspiracism — and feed users increasingly extreme content — because that’s what generates the most engagement and profit,” they warn.“Their own algorithmic tools have boosted everything from white supremacist groups and Holocaust denialism to COVID-19 hoaxes, counterfeit opioids and fake cancer cures. Echo chambers, radicalization, and viral lies are features of these platforms, not bugs — central to the business model.”The coalition also warns over surveillance advertising’s impact on the traditional news business, noting that shrinking revenues for professional journalism is raining more harm down upon the (genuine) information ecosystem democracies need to thrive.“Facebook and Google’s monopoly power and data harvesting practices have given them an unfair advantage, allowing them to dominate the digital advertising market, siphoning up revenue that once kept local newspapers afloat. So while Big Tech CEOs get richer, journalists get laid off,” the coalition warns, adding: “Big Tech will continue to stoke discrimination, division, and delusion — even if it fuels targeted violence or lays the groundwork for an insurrection — so long as it’s in their financial interest.”Among a laundry list of harms the coalition is linking to the dominant ad-based online business models of tech giants Facebook and Google is the funding of what they describe as “insidious misinformation sites that promote medical hoaxes, conspiracy theories, extremist content, and foreign propaganda”.“Banning surveillance advertising would restore transparency and accountability to digital ad placements, and substantially defund junk sites that serve as critical infrastructure in the disinformation pipeline,” they argue, adding: “These sites produce an endless drumbeat of made-to-go-viral conspiracy theories that are then boosted by bad-faith social media influencers and the platforms’ engagement-hungry algorithms — a toxic feedback loop fueled and financed by surveillance advertising.”Other harms they point to are the risks posed to public health by platforms’ amplification of junk/bogus content such as COVID-19 conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation; the risk of discrimination through unfairly selective and/or biased ad targeting, such as job ads that illegally exclude women or ethnic minorities; and the perverse economic incentives for ad platforms to amplify extremist/outrageous content in order to boost user engagement with content and ads, thereby fuelling societal division and driving partisanship as a byproduct of the fact platforms benefit financially from more content being spread.The coalition also argues that the surveillance advertising system is “rigging the game against small businesses” because it embeds platform monopolies — which is a neat counterpoint to tech giants’ defensive claim that creepy ads somehow level the playing field for SMEs versus larger brands.“While Facebook and Google portray themselves as lifelines for small businesses, the truth is they’re simply charging monopoly rents for access to the digital economy,” they write, arguing that the duopoly’s “surveillance-driven stranglehold over the ad market leaves the little guys with no leverage or choice” — opening them up to exploitation by big tech."
What is going on why are companies pulling ads from Youtube like Csco and Amazon ?

Are there still bullish people left here? Funny GOOG used to be my favorite stock but looks like the competition is eating up Google's profitability. Tough times ahead for Google. For the first time in its history google's revenue declined significantly while PE's increasing drastically. We all know where this scenario is leading the price. I know google will fall considerably this year. But I wouldn't short it either. But I believe one must be insane to buy GOOG right now. There are no upside left.

"WordPress says it will block surveillance giant Google’s FloCWordPress, a popular content management system, has said it will begin to block Google’s FloC as it considered the user tracking technology a security concern.The company has released set codes that allow developers to block the FloC for their websites.“WordPress powers approximately 41% of the web – and this community can help combat racism, sexism, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination and discrimination against those with mental illness with four lines of code,” it said in a post.WordPress also cited a blog post from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that had deemed Google’s FloC a terrible idea. The post had criticised Google’s decision to put people in groups based on their browsing habits. It added that it could lead to different types of discrimination and even predatory targeting of unsophisticated consumers."

That said Google here you go.Love the pixel 5, screen is beautiful.No wifi 6. Would have cost you pennies in the grand scheme of things.No headphone jack, now I have to buy wireless buds, don't appreciate that.You do beautiful things like develop YouTube TV, but then charge eighty a month. Way too much.I'm a student, for ten dollars a month I get student prime and for a dollar a month add on, added showtime for a year. Plus all prime movies and series.All you had I wanted really was cnbc and a few shows, news, and some sports, sports center but you don't have enough sports to charge those amounts, not even close.You need to start making some of your own shows and movies or buy AMC networks and lionsgate both. Just 1 won't work.This is as obvious as chipotle offering a shredded lettuce choice with their suck lettuce or scrapping their suck lettuce.An avocado slices option and not the mush cream.Sales go up 25percent if they sold shredded lettuce like McDonald's, make it a 2 dollar add on.Breakfast another 20percent, but the lettuce is so obvious. Also the way you can add flour tortillas, need a button to add taco shells, maybe some cola energy drinks. Make your own type like the old jolt cola.As obvious as dollar tree stores needing a couple self checkout lanes."
Wow...the cloud numbers are Ruthless.

Think its oversold here at 1034. Jumping in and will average down as it drops. This will rebound to 1075 before long.
slowly google will gain its leggs this is a good time to add
LOWER than the DAILY high is not GOOD news people !
"Baffled by the drop following a beat - but seen similar for this Q. Wait for conference call, guidance could easily swing this number drastically one way or the other."

Guess Main Street Finally read the earnings report and didnt listen to cnbc
The lift into close makes me feel a little better.
I’m selling all my google share and taking a short position on Monday. Google has backed themselves in a corner which they will never escape without taking some losses. The world is watching these tech companies bullying half of the country
Took advantage of the pullback to open a position.
Google stole Netlist's patents and has been using them for years... decade plus. You will pay dearly for stealing other's technology without permission. The judge knows it too.
Will blow past street expectations .. the new Acctg adoptions will result in much higher than expected eps

"$opti Holding strong! Can't complain, I work and make money, I take risks and still make Money, you lose some, you win some. Definitely I have not seen anything like this, I hope Optec International is already doing something to prevent these kind of manipulations. Life hasn't been easy, but during those times I always learned not to give up. In my *investment Portfolio I've chosen many right companies to invest in. This one is a pain, but I've regretted not getting on the train on $AMZN or $GOOGL in the past. I don't want to regret this one, if $OPTI it goes down, then it will be one of my worst investments ever made. This and Las Vegas Black Jacks. If it's the other way around It will be the best investments I've ever made, Time will tell.*I am not here to advice you on your investments, but to chat with the $OPTI community and share my reactions. Always do your DD, you are the only one who decides where to put your risks. Always risk what you can afford to lose."
"imagine a 100 to 1 split, thats how you get google to 10k by 2025. you need something appealing to people that only look at price. either way, Waymo & Google Ventures gonna carry the shareholder value much higher than that by 2030, so im only buying!"

"These forums are quite histerical lol. If you are a day trader i can understand, but if you are long there is no reason to be shocked by this q4 report. Growth goes on though at a slower pace, profit is good and the pile of cash keeps on inflating. Never seen such a healthy balance sheet for a young fast growing company... My guess is that this stock is rightly priced at the moment, so it is quite normal that overall the share price didn’t move a lot yesterday. Now as a very long term individual investor i would really appreciate a small growing dividend !"
I’m glad to see YouTube is ramping up its revenue 33%. This is another month making machine with potential not fully exercised yet
"If you compare $NFLX and $AMZN against $GOOGL, $NVDA, $FB then you will realize how smart move this is.$GOOGL, $NVDA and $FB all about same growth rate. Only thing different is those generate lot of profit v/s $AMZN and $NFLX actually have negative cash flow. $FB and $GOOGL actually trading discounted Forward PE just 2 year out than S&P 500 overall.So why NFLX keep going all time high vs other not.two reason.1.> NFLX and AMZN ceo/management active pumping stock price. Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out. You likely profit limited to 10%-15% but again risk is limited."
Everyone should be adding more google to their portfolio
From support GOOGL will be up next week. Great entry point 
Alphabet saw its earnings soar in the first quarter as people stuck at home in the pandemic used more of its services.Nothing like an epidemic to help rake in the profits.
"Again, focus on the numbers since mid March, they are far worse than predicted. People are not buying travel and leisure stuff, which is the lions share of revenue for google. Cloud investments were stalled, employees are forced to stay home."
They are buying back shares and still missed EPS?? That's a sell sign like IBM was at $200

"GOOG's smart phone Pixel 4, equipped with 5G chip will come out this fall season at least 3 months before I-Phone. If GOOG flexes the muscle by flood the market, Pixel 4 above cost just to cover expense, GOOG will upend AAPL with in the next 3 years.Don't forget 5G starts to equipped all hardware and tower since Nov. and service will start in Asia, China in spring, which I guess GOOG already tests QCOM chip with 5G platform. 80% Android global market shares will help GOOG job easier than anybody expect. GOOG only keeps pushing hardware into the user's hand, which automatically increase the mobile ads market shares. I just expect that everybody will move to 5G real fast because everybody wants to download movies in 5 seconds, save much time doing business, Google Pay will be another player in Asia who using Android phone. I like to see GOOG acquires PYPL and DIS to complete the ecosystem, which is my dream."
Good entry under 2000.

Just a solid company. Way way under valued.
Why doesn’t google do a 10:1 split and issue a $1 dividend on the new shares. Google would fly if they did that..

Did GOOGL win lottery?
The way google beat earnings I wouldn’t be surprised if it gets upgraded this week.
It may be a blow out but what ever INSTITUTIONS that are controlling these stock prices could care less how well GOOGL did. Blowing away totals don't count. Let Amazon or Telsa or Netflix have the same experience and BAM a 15% swing. Google hits it and it is a Yawn.
"What do you guys think, hold during earnings?"
WOW! I 've never seen such action!
when the fang stocks start to be taxed with over 20% then you will see how earnings growth can be squeezed
I dont understand why anyone would plow into these here there is zero negatives at all priced in let alone the leverage keeping these bubbles up $aapl $amzn $googl $msft $tsla they are all viacoms waiting to happen except the whole world are long and dependent. In fact one of u should buy viac while your stock is so overvalued
"Public policy official stepping down is good news. Regardless of whether you agree with the walkout, or the overall #metoo movement in general, which I think has gotten out of hand. As a shareholder it is a positive sign that Google is working with employees to right the ship. Happy employees are the base of a thriving company."
"Google will pay some fines to regulators, cry a bit and we all move along after.Regulators also use information by big tech companies to analyse their civilians.Without big tech goverments have less control over civilians, so it's a win win situation. Don't see too much risk."
Come on GOOG: change direction and head true north.
Both GOOG CEO Pichai and MSFT. CEO Nadella are the hardest working under-the-radar CEOs in tech.

Google, like Amazon, I do not think they will split the stock because these kind of stocks is for serious investors"

"Google antitrust lawsuit amended to target Chrome’s Privacy SandboxAn antitrust lawsuit against Google has been amended to take into account changes to ad tracking in Chrome. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton announced the multi-state suit, which focuses on Google's advertising tech, in December. Meanwhile, five more attorneys general (from Alaska, Florida, Montana, Nevada and Puerto Rico) have joined the lawsuit, for a total of 15.The AGs claim that Google harnessed its dominant market positions in search, video and other areas to kill off smaller ad networks and effectively require advertisers to use its platform. The updated suit includes a section about Google's Privacy Sandbox, which is partly about using anonymized data to deliver relevant ads to large groups. Google plans to block third-party tracking cookies in Chrome by 2022.The lawsuit accuses Google of hiding ""its true intentions behind a pretext of privacy"" and suggests that the changes put ""Google’s Chrome browser at the center of tracking and targeting. ""It notes Google's plans to ""disable the primary cookie-tracking technology almost all non-Google publishers currently use to track users and target ads"" and argues that the move would force ""pressure advertisers to shift to Google money otherwise spent on smaller publishers,"" such as local newspapers.""Attorney General Paxton’s latest claims mischaracterize many aspects of our business, including the steps we are taking with the Privacy Sandbox initiative to protect people’s privacy as they browse the web,"" Google told Engadget in a statement. ""These efforts have been welcomed by privacy advocates, advertisers and our own rivals as a step forward in preserving user privacy and protecting free content. We will strongly defend ourselves from AG Paxton’s baseless claims in court.""The UK also announced an investigation into Privacy Sandbox earlier this year."
Google 'a' shares are always a pre-cursor to where the 'b' shares are heading and yes that 1119 close last week was manipulation - I don't follow the options and didn't realize what people were referring to. The 'a' shares are over 1150 this morning.
What happened to googl today? Started out very strong and then fizzled out.
GOOG is indeed chasing AMZN: they are now $ 900 apart. I see a convergence shortly.
Looks like a good buy at 1050. Back above 1100 very soon!
"before the earnings the analysts on cnbc overwhelmingly favored googl and baba over fb and aapl, what a surprise!"

"Google threatens to withdraw search engine from AustraliaGoogle has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers.Australia is introducing a landmark law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content.But the US tech giants have fought back, arguing the laws are onerous and would damage local access to services.“If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,"" said Mel Silva, managing director of Google Australia.""We do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia.""Australian politicians are scheduled to debate the laws in parliament this year.Google Search is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility with little market competition.The government has argued that because the tech giants gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a ""fair"" amount for their journalism.Google's threat to remove its primary product is its most severe yet, in a debate being closely watched globally amid increasing debate about regulating the power of big tech.Ms Silva said the laws would set ""an untenable precedent for our businesses"" and were not compatible with the free-flowing share of information online or ""how the internet works"".Last week, after reports surfaced in local media, Google confirmed it was blocking Australian news sites in its search results for about 1% of local users. It said it was an experiment to test the value of Australian news services.Facebook last year also threatened to stop Australian users from sharing news stories on the platform if the law went ahead."
"Why didn't this move today, every other tech stock moved and this one stayed in one spot throughout."
"A revenue ""miss"" falling short of analyst flawed estimates is a misnomer. A miss is a miss only if it falls short of previous forward guidance from the company, itself."

The court ruled that Google used Netlist’s patents without paying for the usage. When are they going to make it right?
Pull up a chart 1550 coming
It's July 15th 2020 and Google still has not paid Netlist for the IP they stole 10 years ago. It was litigated through the patent court and on June 15th upheld by the appeals court with a nonprecedential rule 36 judgement in Netlists favor. Time to pay up Google.

"i am afraid GOOG will hit 1300 this week because the company already accepts that it has real action not rumor. If GOOG can get the cloud business in China, it will beat AMZN up right at this moment. One thing that no body has better than GOOG is AI, the crown jewel for the future."
The markets KNOW that earnings are going to be good across the board. Makes me think that GOOGL is going to put up some big numbers again but of course that is just a guess. Looks like the beginning of the normal run up a month ahead of the number.
"Based on TSLA valuation, GOOG is worth $3,000 per share. Just saying"

"Here's another one for Tim's comment earlier:@tim said:$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $GOOGLTalk about inflation? FAANG along with the rest of the stock market is inflated. If I wanted to get involved in FAANG as of today's closing prices, it would cost me $4k total to buy just 1 share in each company. Here's my acronym. GEB=Grossly Extended Bubble$FB-$177.46$AAPL-$217.94$AMZN-$1927.68$NFLX-$364.58$GOOGL-$1256.27Here's my take:Tim, you probably thought that on Jan 2, 2018 as well. Let's do the IRA contribution again, but with just FANG stocks. (This example could also be a college fund).$6500 to spend on FANG stocks on Jan. 2, 2018AMZN $1209.59 x 1 share = $1209.59 (18.6% of investment)GOOGL $1095.76 x 1 share = $1095.76 (16.7% of investment)FB $184.33 x 7 shares = $1290.31 (19.8% of investment)NFLX $205.63 x 7 shares = $1439.41 (22.1%) = $1464.93 leftAAPL 173.03 x 8.46 shares = $1463.83 (22.5% of investment), this is an AAPL board, right?So you spent $6500 and ended up with 5 companies and a total of 24.46 shares. Here's where you are as of close 8/27/18, using your numbers verbatim copied:$FB-$177.46 x 7 shares = $1242.22, -3.7%$AAPL-$217.94 x 8.46 shares = $1843.77, +26.0%$AMZN-$1927.68 x 1 share = $1927.68, +59.4%$NFLX-$364.58 x 7 shares = $2552.06, +77.3%$GOOGL-$1256.27 x 1 share = $1256.27, +14.6%Overall, for your $6500 investment, your total is now $8820.00, increase of $2320, and gain of 35.7%. Not bad for owning ""only"" 24.46 shares of good, quality stocks that are leaders in their fields."

"I love $GOOG and they reported an excellent quarter. The implied move was $67 .... this has overshot .... it can still go higher, and options traders can be wrong on occasion, but due to so much uncertainty, I believe this level won't hold till Friday. I don't have any positions in GOOG at the moment. I will wait for a pullback to get back in.I, however, will sell Vertical Call spreads tomorrow . Even with IV crush, there should be Intrinsic value that can help here and the market drops tomorrow, the increase in IV, can help my net vega negative trade."
earnings predictions?

I told you GOOGL will be below $1000 when it is $1170 and you Kong’s laughed. How do you feel now?
"So this is what I am thinking. FB, SNAP and others will come and go but everyone will continue to search for things on the internet. Same as they will buy things off the internet (probably from AMZN). Yes AMZN will take an increased cut from advertising dollars but I expect it will be from FB/SNAP rather than Google. Ask anyone under 20 if they use these platforms anymore, I expect the answer will be no. However the real reason why I invested in the company is the innovation. They spent 16B last quarter on R and D. It only takes one of the innovations to work for this company to double in value, AI, self-driving cars, quantum computing, cloud (to a lesser extent) are all world changers. I hope google wins one of these races!"

Does google even have a PR department because obviously they aren’t communicating with Wall Street. No clarity from the call!
"Why I invest in Google?Basically a monopolist as a search engine, people with android phone give a lot of data to Google (that data is worth money), Youtube is used a lot (though the interface got a bit worse instead of better), AI is becomming more advanced and behind the scenes Google has a lot of research teams working on it.Google usually has large cycles of development and then has a leap in earnings. More advanced searching combined with advertising could get Google a big leap in earnings.The strenght is also a weakness in Europe, but usually Google just pays it off with a fine. They make a lot more money collecting the data, than the fine costs, so from a business perspective that does not matter.They also have smaller investments in China, like JD, which can have acceleration potential if China opens up more."

Betting on Google and Facebook earnings is like playing roulette right now. I'm sure a lot of advertisers have pulled out causing the prices paid for ads to drop. On the other hand there are going to be a lot more ads being served with people staying at home watching YouTube and browsing Facebook all day. SNAP beating Q1 expectations points to a win for FB and GOOGL in the ad department IMO.

"EU’s top privacy regulator urges ban on surveillance-based ad targetingThe European Union’s lead data protection supervisor has recommended that a ban on targeted advertising based on tracking Internet users’ digital activity be included in a major reform of digital services rules which aims to increase operators’ accountability, among other key goals.The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorówski, made the call for a ban on surveillance-based targeted ads in reference to the Commission’s Digital Services Act (DSA) — following a request for consultation from EU lawmakers.The intervention by Europe’s lead data protection supervisor calling for a ban on targeted ads is a powerful pre-emptive push against attempts to water down legislative protections for consumer interests.In his opinion on the DSA the EDPS writes that“Given the multitude of risks associated with online targeted advertising, the EDPS urges the co-legislators to consider additional rules going beyond transparency,” he goes on. “Such measures should include a phase-out leading to a prohibition of targeted advertising on the basis of pervasive tracking, as well as restrictions in relation to the categories of data that can be processed for targeting purposes and the categories of data that may be disclosed to advertisers or third parties to enable or facilitate targeted advertising.”It’s the latest regional salvo aimed at mass-surveillance-based targeted ads after the European Parliament called for tighter rules back in October — when it suggested EU lawmakers should consider a phased in ban."

"Good infoNetlist - High stakes patent litigationNetlist is taking on giants Google and SK Hynix and finds itself with the upper hand. Agni Research15 hr ago 3 1 THESISNote: This is outside our normal focus on biotech stocks. A member of another forum we are part of brought this stock to our attention. We got interested in the stock for its strong risk-reward profile. Netlist (OTC: NLST) is suing several large manufacturers of server memory products for infringement of its patents. Most notably, Google, SK Hynix, and Inphi.RESEARCHThis is straight from the investor portion of Netlist’s website describing the company’s mission: Netlist provides high-performance SSDs and modular memory subsystems to enterprise customers in diverse industries. The Company's NVMe SSD portfolio provides industry-leading performance offered in multiple capacities and form factors. HybriDIMM, Netlist's next-generation storage class memory product, addresses the growing need for real-time analytics in Big Data applications, in-memory databases, high-performance computing and advanced data storage solutions. Netlist also manufactures a line of specialty and legacy memory products to storage customers, appliance customers, system builders and cloud and datacenter customers. Netlist holds a portfolio of patents in the areas of server memory, hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction.Netlist has been in litigation with Google since 2009 over allegations that Google infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 patent. It is a hardware patent for processing commands in an LRDIMM memory module using rank multiplication. Google signed an NDA to take a look at it. It passed on using the technology described in the patent. Netlist alleges that Google infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Google on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Google indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Google then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Google requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Google appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Google was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Google did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Google shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021. At least 7 calendar days prior to the conference, the parties shall meet and confer and file a Joint Case Management Conference Settlement that sets forth the status of the case and proposes a schedule.So why is the 912 patent a big deal? It is a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Google to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed said servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Google’s dominance in search. Right now, it is not a question whether Google infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Google is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages. As for the damages, Netlist will most likely use a hedonic pricing model to determine the damages. Hedonic pricing looks at both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Google’s dominance in search, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Google’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Google’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace."
"I'm long GOOG going into earnings. The company has several arrows in their quiver that they can use anytime they want. * Regular plain old earnings could be very good. * Google is breaking out their cloud earnings for the first time. Seems to me that they wouldn't be doing this if cloud revenue was bad. * They have about $130B in cash. They could announce a special 1-time or recurring (or both) dividend. * They could announce they're spinning off Waymo, or YouTube or their quantum computing segment.There's an awful lot that Google can do to boost the stock price at anytime so it'll be interesting to see what happens on Tuesday afternoon. Good luck to all."

"Judge Denied Google Request to Move State Antitrust LawsuitU.S. District Judge Sean Jordan in Plano, Texas, on Thursday denied Google’s request to transfer the case to California, according to a court filing.The judge said Google had failed to establish that California is a more convenient venue and said that moving it could cause unnecessary delay by combining it with pending class-action lawsuits against the company.The Texas lawsuit, filed by 14 states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is one three government cases accusing the company of abusing monopoly power. The U.S. Justice Department and a group of states are targeting Google’s search business, while the Texas complaint focuses on digital advertising.Google had argued that the Texas case mirrors lawsuits filed against it in California, potentially leading to conflicting court decisions. It also said California is a more convenient venue for witnesses who might testify at trial.The states countered that the case should remain in Texas because there are publishers, advertisers and consumers in the state affected by Google’s advertising business. The Texas court also has a track record of moving cases to trial more quickly than the federal court in San Francisco, they said."
"Incredible earnings announcement! it had just been forming a base for the last year plus, now it's going to explode. New Highs on the way!!! All aboard!!! Don't miss the train.

"Betting against GOOGL is like betting the sun won't come up tomorrow. It is an absolute certainty that GOOGL will be much higher in 5 years than where it currently trades. All these lawsuits are paper tigers. GOOGL is far too big to be killed or even seriously wounded unless it does something like commit fraud. This company has no need to commit fraud when it has no competitive threats and is sitting on $137 billion in cash and is has over a trillion dollar market cap. There is nothing to dislike about this company from an investment standpoint. It is financially healthy, fundamentally cheap, and a very safe place to be in the current environment of rising rates and inflation, unlike the stocks who have yet to earn a profit or have a solid balance sheet. GOOGL has all of that and more."

"Surveillance Giant Google Accused of Collecting Sensitive Roku’s Customer DataRoku called Google an ""unchecked monopolist"" in the latest development of a spat between the two companies.The comment was made after Google announced on Friday that it would allow users to access the YouTube TV app through its main YouTube app on Roku's streaming platform, a move that Roku called ""anticompetitive.""""Google's actions are the clear conduct of an unchecked monopolist bent on crushing fair competition and harming consumer choice,"" Roku said in the statement Friday.Roku also said, ""we have simply asked Google to stop their anticompetitive behavior of manipulating user search results to their unique financial benefit and to stop demanding access to sensitive data that no other partner on our platform receives today.""On April 30, Roku removed the YouTube TV app from its streaming platform because its deal with Google ended due to terms that Roku did not agree with. Those terms included what Roku says was a request from Google to share more sensitive customer data. Roku said it did not ask Google for more money as part of what would've been a renewed contract.

"Have loved owning Google for years BUT this time is different. Yes we will see a spike in cloud services but the advertising, and other ancillary businesses are going to dive. Fantastic balance sheet and they do well down the road but for right now there is still more pain in the stock price. Forget the hype and upgrades and positive analyst comments. Take a step back and really look at the world and the different businesses. Their focus is not on ad spending right now it's on how to pay employees, rent, utilities. This is not going to be over in 6 months and back to business as usual. Factor in at least a year from now.Google around $850-$900 is not out of the question or a far stretch. Not saying this won't be much higher in a few years, but don't think the bottom is in just yet. Wait until they actually announce the numbers and pull guidance. Anyone see the news from WPP and advertising has fallen off a cliff. Dont' think FB and GOOG are immune."

There is no other company who owns so much information about people and where people go to and where people have been than Google. For goverments Google is one of the most important tool to use as a resource for data on certain people. Also the backdoor in phones is helping goverments to access data better. I believe this is bullish for Google and that's why it's a safe longterm bet in my opinion.
GOOG shares moving higher in the premarket! 60 minutes segment lacked any substance and the stock was lower last week in anticipation of some damaging coverage that did not transpire! Chart shows a move to the resistance of 1189 then back to 1100. Good job to all who held through the sell of last week and if you did sell you might look to re-enter here. I will be adding more if we pull back any on open!

"How long before this reaches the US?“ Reform and opening has already failed, but no one dares to say it,” said Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, citing China’s four-decade post-Mao policy. “The current system has created severe social and economic segregation. So now the rulers use the taxpayers’ money to monitor the taxpayers.”"
"In order for us to eclipse and STAY over $1300, in my view, they really need to discuss future strategies for spending all of that net revenue. They're sitting on a huge pile of cash, which is great. but how will they now use it.

$GOOG $GOOGL did not appeal the loss on the 912 to the CAFC because a Rule 36 affirmation is not able to be appealed. Google is taking serious heat at the perfect time for Netlist to capitalize on the proven thievery and get the BILLIONS of dollars of settlement award they deserve

"GOOG CLOUD IS $1 Billion Business!-UPDATE: Google earnings: Cloud is a $1 billion business, execs say21 hours 17 minutes ago - DJNFBy Max A. CherneyGoogle cloud now a fifth the size of Amazon Web ServicesAlphabet Inc.'s earnings Thursday after the bell contained something of a surprising detail: Its Google cloud unit is banking $1 billion a quarter in sales.Though that's a small portion of the company's overall $32.32 billion in revenue, it's a fast-growing chunk. And it's the first time in years executives have broken out cloud specifically. Usually, cloud is grouped into ""Google Other"" with the company's hardware and Play Store sales, which logged sales of $4.69 billion in the fourth quarter -- including the cloud unit -- an increase from $3.4 billion in the year-earlier period.During the company's third-quarter conference call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said she listed the Google Other business segments in order from greatest to least contributor. On Thursday's call, Porat said hardware moved to the front of the list, followed by cloud and Play."

"The Creepy Way Facebook, Google And Amazon Profit Off Our Private DataOur lives and habits are being tracked. Every time we tap in a Google search, every time we click “Like” on Facebook and every time we make an Amazon purchase, we are giving away information about ourselves: our thoughts, our preferences, our behaviors.We are providing data that can be packaged up and sold to companies, which then use that data to try to modify our behavior and steer us toward buying products or using their services.Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff calls it the commodification of human data. In the information era we live in, she explains in her new book, “The Age Of Surveillance Capitalism,” we are the marketable product. It’s a terrifying idea.So, what is surveillance capitalism?It’s important to know that in many ways, surveillance capitalism differs dramatically from other forms of capitalism over the last couple of centuries. Capitalism is claiming things that live outside the marketplace, bringing them into the market and turning them into what people call “commodities,” things that can be sold and purchased.Industrial capitalism, which dominated the late 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, famously claimed nature. The trees and the forests and the rivers — these are entities that have a life of their own. Industrial capitalism brought nature into the market dynamic, and nature was reborn. It was called “land,” and it was called “real estate.” That allowed it to be sold and purchased and become the source of profit.Surveillance capitalism proceeds according to this pattern, but with a dark and unexpected twist. So unexpected, in fact, that it’s taken us quite a while to catch on to what they’ve actually done. Surveillance capitalism claims private human experience for the market dynamic.It says that private human experience is now a source of free, raw material — just like harvesting wheat or collecting ore from a mountain side. [We are] a source of free, raw material that can be processed into data, and those data can be computed and sold and purchased and owned.That sequence has created the largest, wealthiest and most powerful companies — like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon — that the world has ever known. All of that begins with the unilateral declaration that private human experience is ours for the taking.Ultimately, what surveillance capitalists are trying to do is sell predictions. It’s not only to know our behavior, but it’s to predict our behavior. That’s how they make their money.Those predictions are not to improve our lives, but rather they’re sold to business customers who have a business interest in knowing what we will do next — because that raises the certainty that they have about how to successfully get us to behave in a way that serves their bottom line."

"If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"

Of course that's been obvious if you've followed google for any amount of time. Just park your cash in a cash cow and you will be rewarded.

"Sharing Data With Google Would Hurt Future Probes, U.S. Says(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government opposes sharing with Google other companies’ sensitive information in an antitrust lawsuit because it says that would undermine trust and hamper future investigations.The Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc.’s Google last month accusing it of abusing its monopoly in its search engine, the most significant antitrust action against an American company in more than two decades -- and possibly a century.Google is seeking access to confidential information the U.S. has obtained from third parties to prepare for trial. It’s proposing that the sharing of information be done only with its in-house counsel. It also wants advance notice if the information is used in other matters, according to a Justice Department filing in Washington federal court Friday.“Adopting Google’s proposal would undermine third parties’ confidence in the treatment of their confidential information, chill third-party cooperation in current and future government investigations, and unfairly advantage Google in the marketplace if third-party confidential information is disclosed or used,” the U.S. said in the filing.The judge in the case has given companies including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Amazon Inc., AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. until Nov. 20 to stake out a position on restricting their information that may shared by the government with Google during the litigation. The companies called it a “serious concern” in a joint filing, saying they have produced some of their “most sensitive internal business materials.”"

"Watchdog mulls Google probe over ‘anti-competitive’ advertising techThe UK competition watchdog is mulling a formal investigation into Google after it received a complaint about the tech giant’s “anti-competitive” new advertising technology.A consortium of businesses today wrote to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) urging it to delay a major new tech release by Google, which they warned would “cement” the tech giant’s dominance of the online landscape.The complaint relates to Google’s new privacy sandbox, which is set to be rolled out early next year.The group of online businesses, dubbed Marketers for an Open Web, said this new tech will remove login and advertising features from the open web and put them under Google’s control.They warned the changes will deny news publishers access to the cookies they use to sell advertising, causing their revenues to fall by two-thirds.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement this morning, the CMA said: “We take the matters raised in the complaint very seriously, and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act.”“If the urgency of the concerns requires us to intervene swiftly, we will also assess whether to impose interim measures to order the suspension of any suspected anti-competitive conduct pending the outcome of a full investigation.”"

"Google won the search war since 10 years ago with Netlist patent '912 that tripled or quadrupled Google search processing speed by quadrupling memory on their data centers intel search servers that handle all global search queries. Google dubbed this the Caffeine system search. Netlist marketcap is only $90million, Google has 13 more days to ask for rehearing of the final appeal but I feel they will settle for $10 billion ,because this is willful infringement with treble damages also Netlist peeked at $8 in December 2009 & Amazon went up 20fold since then. That would make Netlist a 300 bagger."

"GOOGL-GOOG pair spread at a three year low. The spread seems to narrow end of each year then rebounds in January. Note that GOOGL class A shares will always be worth more than GOOG class C shares. For a portfolio margin account, the pair also has a low margin requirement. Even though the notional on 100 shares of GOOG is large, the margin requirement on the *pair* is very small. Check with your broker. For those who trade pairs and have portfolio margin, I recommend to buy GOOGL and sell GOOG. It's a good pair trade."
"Here is the issue with GOOGL1) management are controlling2) management are not investor friendly 3) the split of GOOGL and GOOL is for management to control every rights 3) GOOGL does not innovate anymore, they just invest in small businesses and hope something sticks 4) they do not give anything back to investor5) they are too big with no transparency to their business6) their business is not growing7) worse management among any FAANG company8) AMZN will soon have it’s own search engine GL"
The market is irrational right now. It doesn't make sense to sell what you have at these prices. But it does make sense to buy if you have a holding period for at least 6 months.

i really wish google can split the shares. i want to invest in google but it's too expensive that I can't even buy 1 share. thinking about investing 1k.
"GOOG will eventually catch up both MSFT and AMZN in data center, due to the capital spending heavily expanding into the United States. Don't be surprised the earnings still grows in the 16-20% this year for the size of GOOG size. Now we know that Fed will not cut the rate this month, so all the big FANGs have the advantage ahead of any body. The economy will slow down but AMZN, FB and GOOG have no problem. Keep an eye on these three, I think it will move up after 3rd week of this month."

For the most part, after all, everybody now offers the same set of basic cloud computing services and the advent of containers has made it easier than every to move workloads from one platform to another. With the combination of TensorFlow and TPUs, Google can now offer a service that few will be able to match in the short term."

This thing is like compressing hard spring, the farther you press it down, the more powerful will the eventual rebound be."

"Waymo CEO stepping down as it continues to rack up huge losses WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) - The head of Alphabet Inc’s self-driving unit Waymo said on Friday he was stepping down as chief executive and would be replaced by a pair of executives.John Krafcik, a long-time auto industry executive who has headed Waymo for more than five years, will stay on as an advisor, the company said. ""This is a choice John has made after a long and successful career in the automotive industry,"" Waymo said in statement.Dmitri Dolgov, one of the founders of the Google self-driving car project and Tekedra Mawakana, who was Waymo's chief operating officer and has worked at a number of tech firms, will serve as co-CEOs, the company said.""We’re committed to working alongside you to build, deploy, and commercialize the Waymo Driver,"" the co-CEOs said in the statement.Waymo, which was formed in 2009 as a project within Alphabet's Google unit, is widely considered the leader in developing self-driving technology. But Waymo is still years away from building large-scale businesses, while their rival Tesla Inc has been selling its semi-automated driving system."

This is hilarious both Apple & Google deliver stellar growth and earnings and are down however Amazon who delivers on growth but tanks on earnings is up massively. I suppose people do not actually look at the numbers and it is largely the perceived narrative. I do have to say the analyst upgrades on Amazon suggest that there is very little analysis in play.
Shopify Web Services is pricing in the very strong possibility that they will take over more than half of AWS customer base by 2020. $AMZN $MSFT $GOOGL $CRM $ORCL
"With such as great performance, the market has to reward the stock! I noticed any reaction to google earnings is usually reserved fore next day by the market, going back a few quarters, this seems to be a trend! Anyone care to comment on this?"
"I think the best strategy is to buy May $1100 calls and sell April 27 against it. I bought May $1100 call for $25.10 earlier and now turned it to calendar spread and sold the April 27th against it for $$20.10 so net it costs me $5, even if GOOGL be over $1100 by end of week, this give me 3 more weeks to sell options against it. If it goes down, I have till May 2017 to recover. If it does nothing this week and stays around this price, my May call will worth more than $5. Just one trade strategy to think of. GL"
FED speak and CNBC comments spooks the stock market once again. Can't they all stay silent and leave us alone?
"Say I believe, if you think it can get over $2080 again this week."
"And the analyst upgrades keep coming in. GOOGL has 25 active analyst with a BUY ratings , 1 with a hold, and not a single Sell. Average price target is now around $1920. Hard to argue with fundamental results! Income statements talk and short sellers who were dead wrong scream and tell lies. Great job to the GOOGL team on their 3Q performance. Once volatility from the election is behind us GOOGL is going to quickly climb towards $1,900."

"It just doesn't make sense GOOG gets hammered today reaction to trade war. Google has no business in China and has been banned by the Chinese government due to the censorship. Google doesn't need China to make money. Actually, Google will benefit from teh drop of its Chinese competitor Baidu."
"Many will badmouth GOOG for various reasons but there is no denying the core revenue growth rate of around 23%. You just don't find that anywhere. And this company has a quasi worldwide monopoly in search. Owning some GOOG or GOOGL is a no-brainer. It's worth $1035 - $1245 right now, depending on what multiple you want to award it."
Hey $GOOG time to pay the piper. Caught red handed Federal court of appeals came down hard in decision. Settle and or buy Netlist
It's July 9th 2020 and Google still has not paid Netlist for the IP they stole 10 years ago. It was litigated through the patent court and upheld by the appeals court with a nonprecedential rule 36 judgement in Netlists favor. Time to pay up Google
I sold Google (I have brought 100 total between 1070-1110). Will enter again near 1080-1010. just preparing for next down trend that I think going to happen soon.This is great company and great operating matrix. I might regret my selling quickly.

My only regret in investing in Alphabet is that I didn't buy more. This is the kind of stock that you never sell.

Fred thank your for the intelligent analysis! I also see upside potential.
1200 after earnings. Low PE rathio compared to alle the things they have coming.
Bring on the DOJ lawsuits. They tried this on Microsoft in the 2000s and the stock briefly cratered only to return to new highs. These lawsuits will go nowhere. I'll buy every dip. GOOGL is undervalued even at these levels. Very little to be bearish on. Shorts are going to pay with their life savings for betting against this behemoth.
"After the bell, 100 points up."
"'Inevitable' Google and Facebook will pay for Australian news, treasurer saysJosh Frydenberg has warned the internet giants it is “inevitable” they will pay for news content and their threats to shut down core functions in Australia do them a “big disservice”.At a doorstop on Sunday, the treasurer said the Morrison’s government intended to become a “world leader” in regulating social media and search companies, who he accused of shifting the goalposts in their opposition to the proposed bargaining code of conduct.Google and Facebook are both fighting against legislation currently before the parliament that would force them to enter into negotiations with news media companies for payment for content, with an arbiter to ultimately decide the payment amount if no agreement can be reached.On Friday, the pair escalated the dispute by threatening to remove the Google search engine from Australia and Facebook to remove news from the Facebook feeds of all Australian users.The threats follow the revelation that Google has been experimenting with hiding some Australian news sites from search results, in a move media outlets said was a show of “extraordinary power”.Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne the government had worked with the Australian competition regulator for two years developing the code to “see the digital giants pay for original content that is generated by our media businesses”.Frydenberg accused the tech companies of “changing the goalposts” by first opposing the government’s proposal of final offer arbitration and now opposing paying for clicks on media content displayed in search results.He said “if the clicks for media content is such a small proportion of their overall clicks on the search” that would be reflected in the payment determined by the independent arbiter.Frydenberg noted the government’s position was supported by media companies and public polling, after a Dynata poll conducted for the Australia Institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology found that four in five respondents found it “disturbing” that Australian results could be removed from news feeds.“It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said."
"glad I sold 1000 shs GOOG at $1285.50 and went short......I thought it was over extended...in case you didn't notice the very thing that caused GOOG to go down, lost advertising revenue, went into FB's pocket......booyah...I'm long FB"

"A little late for people just now realizing that you have no privacy or security online. There is a reason you don't pay for online services like Facebook.

Google is also tracking your every move if you own an Android device. Yes. They know where you are always. Want privacy? Get off the internet, lose your computer and cell phone and go back to living like it's 1980 again. Really surprised regulations weren't put in place long ago."

"The Chromium-based Vivaldi browser banned Google’s FLoCGoogle’s new tracking method FLoC continues to see opposition grow, as Vivaldi labels the new tracking system as 'privacy-invasive' and 'nasty'. The Chromium-based Vivaldi browser has removed FLoC, Google's controversial alternative identifier to third-party cookies for tracking users across websites.FLoC, or Federated Learning of Cohorts, has just been released by Google for Chrome as its answer to improving privacy while still delivering targeted ads.But Vivaldi has called it a ""dangerous step that harms user privacy"".""Google's new data harvesting venture is nasty,"" it declared in a blog post that begins with the header ""FLoC off! Vivaldi does not support FLoC"".""At Vivaldi, we stand up for the privacy rights of our users. We do not approve tracking and profiling, in any disguise. We certainly would not allow our products to build up local tracking profiles.""It presents FLoC as part of a set of so-called 'privacy' technologies, but let's remove the pretence here; FLoC is a privacy-invasive tracking technology.""Vivaldi is based on Chromium. But while it relies on the Chromium engine to render pages correctly, it said this is where Vivaldi's similarities with Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers end.It said the FLoC experiment does not work in Vivaldi as it relies on some hidden settings that are not enabled in Vivaldi.The FLoC component in Chrome needs to call Google's servers to check if it can function since Google is only enabling it in parts of the world that are not covered by Europe's GDPR. As the blog explained, Vivaldi does not allow such a call to be made to Google.""We will not support the FLoC API and plan to disable it, no matter how it is implemented. It does not protect privacy and it certainly is not beneficial to users, to unwittingly give away their privacy for the financial gain of Google,"" it said. FLoC has been widely criticised by privacy advocates, even though it is an improvement to third-party cookies. The Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) called it a ""terrible idea"" because now Chrome shares a summary of each user's recent browsing activity with marketers. As Vivaldi explained, an ad company could previously only see the aspects of a user's personality relating to the websites where its ads were used. An ad provider that was only used for 1,000 websites might only have seen each visitor on one or two of their sites, so they could not build up much tracking data about a user.""FLoC changes this completely. Its core design involves sharing new information with advertisers,"" it continued. ""Now every website will get to see an ID that was generated from your behaviour on every other website.""You might visit a website that relates to a highly personal subject that may or may not use FLoC ads, and now every other site that you visit gets told your FLoC ID, which shows that you have visited that specific kind of site.""FLoC, Vivaldi said, has very serious implications for people who live in an environment where aspects of their personality are persecuted, such as their sexuality, political viewpoint, or religion.""All can become a part of your FLoC ID,"" it said.""This is no longer about privacy but goes beyond. It crosses the line into personal safety.""We reject FLoC. You should too."""

"While I usually feel political posts should go elsewhere, I will make an exception. Working with the U.S. intelligence community on several projects I could not resist giving my thoughts about what has been going on in this country for quite a while. Disclaimer: I voted for neither Presidential candidate of the major parties during the 2016 election. ""Who rules America""?After forty years of observation, readings, and conversations, it's the elites via their organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.They are the primary drivers behind the efforts to impeach Trump. They are using their assets in the Press, the intelligence community, the media, etc. for the impeachment of Trump.They had heavily invested in getting the Clintons into power. The Trump election and the Brexit were major blows to their plans for a one world government run by their shills like the Clintons, JImmy Carter, George Bush I, etc.They cannot control Trump like the others. During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an add in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because unlike Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, the Clintons, etc., they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans.We have met the primary enemy and they is us!"

When the rioter come through the front door, the CNN videographer says WE DID IT and Can I give you a Hug. Who at CNN knew about this? Why were they there before the rioting began?

"Not worry about Google's stock being down. It might went up little bit too fast anyway. But for long term investor, it is just a little bump on the way up, since Google is the best company in the world for its contribution to all fields. Most people might think Google is just a search company. It actually is an AI company. Its AI technology leads the whole field of AI and is applied to all other fields. Google's AI driven self-drive car is the best, its AI driven cloud service is not the leader yet, but has the most potential, not mentioning its AI driven search engine is just getting better and better. Google actually published most AI papers on the 'Nature' and ' Science', the most prestigious scientific journals which only publish breakthrough work. So, I'm confident that 10 years from now, Google will still be on the lead for all information technology. BTW, I'm not working for Google, but I do have a PhD in AI field."
"Relax, GOOG will come back, it is ways better than AMZN. Since Friday, AMZN was up 3 points but GOOG is up 8 points, today AMZN is down 72 points but GOOG is down just 32 points. It shows strength of the stock it self. It will recover, just don't worry, be happy. Buy GOOG little by little when it is down like this, because GOOG is too good to follow the market."

"Judge in Texas lawsuit against Google issues protective orderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The judge hearing the Texas antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc's Google put limits on what the search giant's in-house lawyers can see in an order aimed at ensuring that confidential information used in an upcoming trial remains secure.The issue is a key one for companies that have not been identified but that gave information to the Texas attorney general's office for its investigation and fear that their confidential data, like strategic business plans or discussions about negotiations, could be disclosed to Google executives.The order issued by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas allows Google's in-house counsel to see information deemed ""confidential"" but they are then limited in advising on some competitive and other decision-making for two years regarding the companies whose data they see.In-house counsel for Google is barred from seeing ""highly confidential"" information under the order unless it is given permission by the court or the affected company.The Texas lawsuit accuses Google of violating the law in how it dominates the process of placing ads online. It alleges Google quietly teams with its closest online advertising competitor, Facebook Inc, and that it uses the excuse of protecting users' privacy to act unfairly. Publishers complain that one result has been lower revenues.It is one of three big antitrust lawsuits filed against Google last year."

"Progressive groups warn Biden that giving White House roles to anyone with Google ties, including its former CEO Eric Schmidt, would 'alienate' the nation • More than a dozen progressive organizations published an open letter to President-elect Joe Biden Tuesday, warning him against appointing anybody with ""close ties to Google"" to his administration. • The groups wrote that they ""want to ensure that the internet isn't dominated by a handful of corporations and remains free and open."" • The groups said Biden should avoid giving former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a role, after a Financial Times story described Schmidt as a possible lead for a new tech task force in Biden's White House. • The letter to Biden said appointing Schmidt would risk ""fracturing a Democratic coalition"" and ""alienating an overwhelming majority of the electorate."" • A source familiar with the matter told Recode that the Biden transition team had not discussed a planned role for Schmidt. More than a dozen progressive groups published an open letter to President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, urging him not to appoint people with ""close ties to Google,"" including the tech giant's former CEO Eric Schmidt, to senior roles in his administration.The 14 progressive groups — including The Revolving Door Project, a group which scrutinizes the appointments of executives in office — urged Biden to take a ""hard line against the influence of individuals with close ties to Google.""The groups wrote that they ""want to ensure that the internet isn't dominated by a handful of corporations and remains free and open.""The Financial Times reported November 8 that Schmidt was being discussed as a possible lead for a new technology industry task force in the White House, without describing its sources.Biden has not publicly discussed a role for Schmidt, and Silicon Valley sources close to the Biden team told Recode Tuesday they weren't aware of any plans to appoint Schmidt. One source familiar with the matter also said the Biden transition team had not discussed a planned role for Schmidt.A spokesperson for Schmidt declined to comment to Business Insider.The letter, also signed by the Open Markets Institute, the Communications Workers of America, the Action Center on Race & the Economy, and others, said an appointment for Schmidt would alienate ""an overwhelming majority of the electorate ... who want to see the economic power of major corporations reined in.""""In reviewing your transition's disclosure of its agency review teams, we were struck and concerned by the apparent widespread influence of people with close professional ties to Google generally and more specifically Eric Schmidt, a former CEO of Google with a current multi-billion dollar stake in the company,"" the groups said. The groups referenced the antitrust lawsuit filed against Google by the Department of Justice on October 20. The case argues that Google disadvantaged competitors through a network of exclusionary business deals, and is the tech giant's largest legal challenge yet.Having Schmidt in a senior US government position ""could have a chilling effect on US antimonopoly policy moving forward,"" they said.The letter said appointing Schmidt would risk ""fracturing a Democratic coalition"" and ""alienating an overwhelming majority of the electorate.""The groups also pointed to the news that Schmidt was reportedly obtaining citizenship in the European island, Cyprus, per Recode, allowing him to travel to the European Union and possibly reap tax benefits. Schmidt declined to comment to Recode at the time.In light of this news, appointing Schmidt would send a ""dangerous message"" during a time of ""historic wealth inequality,"" the groups said.Schmidt has a net worth of about $15 billion and is one of the wealthiest people on the planet.The groups also referenced a survey by the organization Demand Progress, in which more than half of people agreed Biden should refuse to appoint any individuals with ties to Big Tech companies that are being sued by the Department of Justice.""The American people are divided on many things, but not on what they view as fundamental issues of legal and economic justice like this one,"" they said."

GOOG will have to settle to avoid bad publicity before jury will make a verdict. To add salt to the injury GOOG lawyers and engineers lied to the courts and NLST shareholders have been taken losses thru all these years. Very bad image of a company making so much money..."

Also, before I increase a position or buy a new position I look to see what the short numbers are from previous month to present month. It can be a good indication, depending on volume, which way the stock is heading.In Googl's case, the short positions have decreased. So i'll be holding my stock up to earnings on Tuesday. It's total cash to debt along with free cash flow is outstanding. I'm hoping for a good report and I'm not worried about future guidance due to its monetary strength.Just like Apple's future guidance, which was not super, has gone up.

I was only off a little over on my dip prediction today of $2350...not bad though
GOOGL Technical Indicators on the daily chart are showing good signs although the volume is not so good .. it needs to close above $1166 to strengthen the uptrend .. next resistance level around $1180 then its free to $1280
Tomorrow will see a nice bounce. Bad news for good companies is normally a two day event. Day 3 will see the stock stabilizing and therefore green just tomorrow followed by a strong Friday.

"The stock didn't fall 7,8 or 10% because Revenue is up. They had 8 billion more in revenue than last yr for this same quarter. Sure, it was expected but when it actually happens it confirms how solid the company really is.They have also bought back a lot of their stock. They are swimming in cash and they have also been spending a lot, just not as much as amazon.Let's face it, a trillion dollar company that keeps growing its revenue will not fall apart just from an earnings miss. Even though they missed, its remarkable they are still growing the revenue at that rate. This is why these companies wipe their #$%$ with 5 billion dollar fines. Just put it on the credit card."

This I a great earning report. That can’t be argued. Wait for the guidance at 4:30. After hours market is not a true valuation of share price. Guidance will make or break tomorrow’s open. And what’s to worry about? If the stock dips buy more. Think of the revenue to come with Waymo and other proven moon shots that have yet to monetize

i think the main reason for today's run in GOOGL is that Page and Brin were always against going to China. Now that they are not running the show Google may consider entering China's market ( providing china wants them to ) . If google even hints at it stock at 1500 in a day
New high everyday LOL!

Quite the reversal.
How can anyone bet against this juggernaut? It's only a matter of time until it sees new highs. Many wish they could own GOOG!

this stock is going down. why? because the first quarter was only jan feb March. i.e. the worst effects of covid19 are not even included in googles performance. i.e. april and may

"Own the companies that will own the future. In 20-30 years, there may not be any jobs left. AI might run all aspects of our lives. The government-corporate entity controlling our lives will have to supply the masses with a basic income to keep them from revolting. The only people with actual freedom, with wealth, will be the owners, the people who bought $FB, $NVDA, $GOOGL, and $AMZN, among a few others, and some new ones that will crop up. As Marc Andreesen said, ""software is eating the world."" And now AI is eating software. And the only ones of us that will be eating well in the future are the ones who own these companies. $FB happens to be the cheapest of the lot, right now, with 50% YoY earnings growth that deserves a 50 P/E but instead it gets something under 20. But you need to own them all. Except maybe $AAPL. It will probably do well for a few years with services growth, but it will eventually be plowed under and turned into fertilizer for the next round of world-changing tech startups. It doesn't innovate, and it's just waiting to die. You're better off with $INTC or even $AMD.Point is, in 20-30 years, there will only be two kinds of people: the owners, and the masses. Own these stocks to be in the first group. (I would add biotech to this as well, but I can't recommend any currently)"

"Rumors being pushed that our Alphabet/Google may acquire Tesla for $1,500/share. I don't see the logic of such an acquisition, and at such a high valuation. Seems like that would be great for only Tesla shareholders. Thoughts anyone?"
"“Don’t be fearful and suspicious, be brave and curious“. Google Search has been an amazing friend through college and work. Let’s hope it stays the same for many others out there.. for years to come :) And Chrome is an amazing browser."

"Watched Navarro interviewed on CNBC. Clearly they are in no hurry, so we can expect a deal with China will not happen until closer to the Presidential election for political gain. This Administration is banking on interest rate cuts by the FED to keep the economy going and stocks moving upward."
Who panic bought after earnings?
"goog $2,070 ah"
This is how it all started with MSFT which led to a decade plus of struggles. This stock should be down 5% although in today's Alice in Wonderland market I am surprised its not UP 5%. Record fine!! Yea!!!! Must mean Google is AWESOME!!!!!!
Back on fire! Lets go 1300!!
"EU Socialist lady I think is a lady on CNBC is typical of a stay at home and depend on government to pay your expenses and give you enough to pay for your tea, grass,medical, and you get to stay at home and contribute nothing or innovate anything."
The pressure on Google is uncanny. Should be well above 1100 even 1200. Huge growth potential with little to no debt.
Trump and congress will come to a budget agreement this week. Google will likely use it to announce a major buyback will its cash hoard
GOOG: might fill GAP 1140 today then 1160 within this week
"aS OF right now. I would have Quadrupled my money on those $1,190 calls, if it weren't for the massive 10 am DROP, losing my entire account. Sold at the LOW OF THE DAY"
So the government is gonna force Alphabet to support other companies interests on the google platforms before they can support their own.. how is that right? if you own a company you gonna give your competitors first in line status???
"If you guys will pull up your charts and look, set it for 1 week candlesticks, you will see a very firm trading Channel, with an upward trend. Playing this trimmed correctly you should easily get some games and only have 2 trade-in about once a week maybe a little bit more than that."
OMG look at it run

What an incredible deal. This change in society has incredible ramifications for long term opportunities for Google. They will benefit long term.
hA HA ALL TECH buyers. Nasdaq so over bought/priced here. i see several thousands more down sides here.
FANG UNCOUPLING ....Looks like GOOG has lost it's luster.... with the stock falling under it's 50 day moving average and bad press along with the growth mode no where near yesteryear ... Money may be coming out and going into FB where the growth and money making potential is going into hyper growth with new platforms and recent expansion over seas.
No way that this can end well for GOOGL https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-12/silicon-valley-will-pay-the-price-for-its-lefty-leanings
"I recall when AMZN crossed over the $1 Trillion valuation, it didn't remain above that threshold very long.

AMZN TSLA are leading of high fly stocks now :) hope Google can follow
"Give it time $1,091 pivot ........then take off. Were close."
The stock is not underperforming today
"After what I read about GOOG on https://shr.link/Beststockalerts the other day, I’m starting to think about opening a position."
"GOOG revenue is growing at 20-25% rate. The EPS more like 30%. So a decent price of 30X32 = 960. Plus 120 or so for cash. To me its 1100 value. The concern is that growth may slow down. Last quarter did not slow the growth. So keep going as long as it does. When it does not I will take a loss, until then we can take profits."
"When other people sell, we need to buy. Then only you get max profit. But remember that market news plays an important role."
"Bad move google, you never censorship the masses during a global movement"
LDSR excellent news
I think the best FAANG stock currently is gooG. I also like the set up here with that gap being closed from earnings. And the 3% buyback. Nice to be doing that with the stock weak.

"Bad write-up on GOOG about them having become Followers and wasting capital on 'unrealistic dreams projects', and being viewed as no longer the leader. IMO, management needs to refocus and quit worrying about how to stop Trump. Better yet, quit verbally discussing Trump, what a huge mistake. Again they must refocus on strong Revenue growth!"

Netlist is about to be rich!
"Back to 1500 the stock is broken and overvalued, employee morale is gone"
So. Google and others just hoped Netlist would not get to this point. Surviving years of lost potential income and left with no money to defend criminal patent infringement. All along a fraud was perpetrated; stealing each and every year for near 12 years willfully what was rightfully ours. They miscalculated in a very large and criminal way though. Google and the other fraudster’s shareholders will know these gruesome facts soon enough. They must now face the music. Criminal actions like this willfully acted on have large penalties attached to them. Why? To act as a deterrent for future transgressors of course. The law must be applied here to the benefit of Netlist. Time to move on to the final chapter. Netlist needs to be free of this forced upon them monumental fraud.

"Australia's political opposition to support Facebook, Google legislationCANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's political opposition will support proposed legislation that would force Alphabet's Google and Facebook to pay publishers and broadcasters for content, two sources briefed on the matter said.Prospects for the bill, which the U.S. tech giants fiercely oppose, are being widely watched around the world as other countries are expected to follow suit if Australia is successful in its efforts.Google has described the legislation as ""unworkable"" and has threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia. Both companies are lobbying hard for the legislation to be softened, with senior executives holding talks with Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg."

Good luck!
Google buying back their shares
Why is it going down? Bought at 1450. Will it go up again?
Thanks for the call for patient!
$790 Google tomorrow. Ouch!
No volume but company not aggressively buying back their own stock at depressed levels while sitting on 110 billion in cash and generating huge free cash flow is showing poor management!
awesome buying opportunity to be sure at this stage. it will probably go up 10 15 20 plus dollars tomorrow from this current low.
pixel phones are much better than the lousy iphone
Anyone heard about and have any input regarding Alphabet’s ER guidance including the stock buyback class C? This was mentioned again in CNBC. Why not include the class A stock buyback as well. I am not 100% sure if I heard CNBC correctly. Anyone know about class C buyback?

Should be a good day. SNAP beats earnings and GOOG up as well as stock market futures. Election year and the whole world in home-office should bump up nicely.
If GOOG takes on some debt their ROE would balloon. Tons of upside this is Apple in 2012 on steroids.
I just don’t understand why this stock go up and down whole day. Always end up where it started. Doesn’t go anywhere yet. Should I sell at a loss?

GOOG has 5 years advantage on AI, which GOOG starts to flex the muscle by compete with AMZN in Home Security and Accessaries. The lone star this year will be Pixel smart phone which I have confidence that GOOG can gain market share from AAPL and SAM SUNG. For the mobile ads I don't worry, because no body will match GOOG.

Investors are smart to pick the stock which has potentially high growth rate. GOOG should shine.
WARNING : CHEAP SHARES...BUY NOW
Woowwww!
Beautiful day in tech land!
Investigate Drumpf for manipulating the market with his tarrif tweets that benefit his family and friends.
"I sold for a loss at 1022. Bought KHC on the open, since it's dropped so much !!"
"bought in at 1415... $100 down in less than 2 trading days is irrational, I'll take a bite."
I am really glad that I found (http://stocktip.xyz)- they just sent an alrt that is up like 77% in a week. Good stuff!
Hoping to see 1650 tomorrow
Sounds like a great buying opportunity to me
What will you do if this turns down by tomorrow?
Nasdaq dropping. This is up 29 points for NO REASON AT ALL.
"DuckDuckgo web Queries hit 100M a day for the first time..

Does anyone have any idea how i could invest in NIANTIC Labs? Their technology will reign supreme IMHO.
WOW dropping hard. Growth not meeting expectations.
"There, buy all you can buy, we sell it for you."

I’m selling Puts for tariff & fedrate cut protection. See your favorite broker for details.
"I'm confused, I'm watching it go down and people saying they didn't beat expectations while The Street is saying it went up and beat expectations. What? Lol"
I'm back in at 1000 +/- 15
"real investors focus on the Stock!, in how strong and profitable it is!, not chicken littles watching the sky is falling. Even with those Trade Wars and rumors!, honestly I was expecting be very down today, but on the contrary, it's going up"
This seems like a once in 10 years opportunity
"Google is a malware company. There is no way to sugarcoat their malware business model and they are worthless without users data. Despite Google is in large scale malware business by harvesting billions of people data, no malware company can worth 800B because regulations will eventually catch up to their malware business practices. They will continue to bribe our law makers to protect their malware business in the near term but long term investors must realize the regulation risk as well as future earnings risk."
GOOG will thrive because it's the universal search engine with cloud infrastructure and the clout of a govt.
Opening green tomorrow
I am adding GOOG into earnings.
"With the collapse of the spire, Victor Hugo's Hunch back Of Notre Dame now best seller"
"Sequoia Fund added to Facebook stake in Q3 https://seekingalpha.com/news/3395557?source=ansh $GOOG, $GOOGL, $FB, $AMZN"
Google announced they are filing an appeal!
I heard about GOOG the other day on http://stocktip.xyz. It’s looking like an interesting play.
Will Monday be a red day or a green day? 
Was lucky sold all holdings over $160!Will buy back later at pullback or dips
"Market will go back up..... If it was going to crash Wall St and others would of sold off FANG stocks hard. They are up on avg of 12x since the bull run began. They are also trading on avg 9x earnings. They are so overvalued and so much money has been made off of them. Yet they are only down on avg of 16 percent yet others are avg 30 percent. I think what is really going on devaluing other companies, lower interest rates. So these companies (who work on behalf of China) can purchase more companies pennies on the dollar. FANG stocks have acquired over 500 companies since the bull run has begun. Your government can not take your constitutional rights away, so instead they will create companies that become so big that they will."
I'm gaga over google
"Ok, I was wrong about this getting to $1,200 after Earnings. With what they reported though, it should be $1,200 minimum. It will get there, but maybe not before they get more shares first. Congrats to longs, that was a great quarter."
"The price action is really not a big deal, since the volume is very low. Basically the institutions are not actively buying or selling and Google is not in the market buying back shares. we all have to wait until earnings."
"i bet the trump clans and their insiders bought lotsa puts too,)"
"Until management announce some good news that suits well with investors which they never do, this stock is as good as dead"
"Because of Facebook Google has a lot of similar info about people and the tide is turning for many people due to the way the data can be used... So Google may be facing scrutiny and regulation and a general lowering of people sharing their information,"
"Take some Google profit and check out CLNY, former REIT getting into edge computing."

The Democrats are pumping this stock despite Trump's tweet
"Maybe Google should pull out of the EU like it did from China. Within 24 hours the streets of every city would be filled with protesters. Within 5 days of total unrest and revolution, all fines would be canceled and the entire EU governing body would be begging them to come back."
"The habitual algorithm changes have nothing in common with making search better, they're engineered to make Google richer and to penalize small business trying to get their products and services noticed. For the small guy to rank highly with Google search, what's required is to pay an insane amount for adwords, which of course continue to get bid higher and higher by ""phantom Googlebots"" to drain your wallet."
Do it sell sell seconds left sell
What is the market thinking. Is Google supposed to have the same PE as GM?
Today is the day we close above $2100... I can feel it. Let's Go!!!
"Sold and bought back into Goog and Amzn in the last dip, funny how I'm kinda disappointed I'm only up 5+% with Goog because I'm up 12+% on Amzn. 1st world problems!"
I'm deleting my youtube channel. my family served in the military to protect and guarantee the very rights these fascist companies are embracing. it's extremely dangerous for our country.
Google is now an extreme left wing hate group! Use duckduckgo for search engine! Avoid youtube as much as you can until a non-hate group rises up to replace them.

GOOG is my forever stock. Not selling a single share for a few years from here.Entry at a deep discount.
Does anyone think Google might Split again?
So when is Google going to pay for stealing someone else's patent? You were ordered to. Before you know it everyone that owns Google shares is going to lose their shirt too. Watch out for those that steal like GOOGLE!
"GOOG is up about 20% from January 2020, could see a quick move down but will be back up if the market holds. 50-100 dollar move isn't unusual. GooG & their party are hand in hand both feed the other, not much will change with new ADM."
Keep buying until the 15 then I will short this to the ground before the no-deal come out as expected.

"Google is fake innovation. It's not real technology. The original Google search was innovative and useful, but everything else since is just a tool to track and censor us in a new age fascist system. Everyone thinks it is innovative but it isn't really. It doesn't make our lives better. You know what was truly innovative? The light bulb. Figuring out how to feed billions of people. The airplane. Figuring out how to go to the moon. That stuff was innovative. This is FAKE INNOVATION. Real innovation today would be things like curing coronavirus, curing cancer, having an endless supply of cheap, renewable energy. MONEY WILL SEEK OUT THE REAL INNOVATION."

What is the matter? GOOG and FB are different story at all by now. I bet you GOOG will hit 1400 by year end. If GOOG can appeal EU case to drop some fine is a plus. FB will be in the water another 6 months at least. I still believe that AMZN and GOOG will calm investors down after today afternoon.

"IMHO, there's a MAJOR FAULT IN GOOGLE's ad-algorithm from the advertisers' point of view.When one visits a company's website and checks out some products and later enters another, not-related website (say a news site), Google shows me an ad offering me the first company's products (that I already have checked out, and maybe even bought). Now, as a competitor I would much more prefer to pay to have ALSO my company's (another company offering same/similar products) to pop up on that persons screen, wouldn't I.In essence, companies are paying Google for ads that have ALREADY been seen and checked out!Google needs to fix to give more value to advertisers!"

Forrest Gump syndrome is the cause—a complete lack of awareness by the spectrum-bound employees & mgt. they THOUGHT life was like a video game, but they’re about to find out most of the world will not put up with their excrement. Yes, there ARE other options. This is not the time to be holding Google, IMO."

"I went long last April a number of tech (growth) plays, Googl, Tsla, AMZN, Appl, and FB. Then, these all skidded until early June when Fed flopped the switch on its message. I sold out of all ‘em at the time.Now back today, my gut tells me all these have room to go this year. (Definitely long term they do.). However, I’m also concerned we could see a recession later in the year due to low growth environment... perhaps this is all the more reason to by these equities. The low growth economy scenario being reason to buy these. Thoughts the picks and concentration?"
come on Google wake up pls

I guess we are at the end of the ALPHABET ...
it's forming a double bottom
But why on earth will this hopeless POS drop lower than FB that actually has the ongoing issues? I've always been long GOOGL but it's testing my patience now.
the after hours are down less than what it was up yesterday. lol. earnings were not a masssive dissapointment at all they were decent
I'll just sit back .Watch Laugh-in and watch the slow running water.
Google cloud offerings are very strong
Google is only surging because they are being rewarded for heeding their masters orders (DNC). The big holders will start taking their profits and it will go back down to under performing. Look for FB to be the next tech stock to be rewarded for censoring the enemies of the Democratic party.
Did I miss something?
More up than down is a good stock.
"I'll pick up more under $1000 on next ""world is ending pump by CNBC"""

The volume towers you all noticed them. Its interesting at which point did they happen. its extremely tied to Nasdaq index flip point. everyone standing looking what everyone going to do. Am I right ?
Very pricy still since folks left for other search engines
Google just spent 2.9 Billion dollars on Chelsea Market. They will spend another 100 billion filling it up on unproven startups. The gov't is just now starting to investigate how FB and Google retrieve so much personal information without the participants knowledge or approval. Only a matter of time this stock will be reevaluated by wall street.
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.

"Before 2018, AMZN and GOOGL had the same share price. Then Bezos made up lies like they would have delivered packages using drones in 2018. That year, AMZN stock price was up 90% and left GOOGL far behind. But now traders know better. GOOGL is the better company of the two. Company is doing all the right things not using accounting tricks and lies."
Seems that stock market futures are green and HUGE government-stimulus is underway...... Whatever it takes! Plus the economy us getting ready for the time after Corona and has a lot to catch-up....... marketing and advertisement will spike....... whatever it takes.......
People love buying in high :)
"Again, thank you Google for helping save the World "
"Interesting. 50 and 200 day MA have been converging and they should meet today. Either a bump or a crash. Fun to watch. I expect a bump up. Nothing to do with the company, its all about predicting how computer trading models will react."
"If you got cash and can wait 6 months, this is a no brainer."
"If market reverse today, GOOGL will be below $1050 by Friday."

"My belief the worst is over. No community spread in China, South Korea, or Africa. The heat kills it. It spreads so fast it burns itself out. Mortality rate in South Korea was only 0.7%.

"uptrend continues, i will stop buying if i stop using Google search which i do not see that will happen. I am using android phone, 3 android tablets , gmail , utube all the time. i Love them."
"The other area if GOOG wants to challenge AAPL, it will be the smart watch. GOOG can do a lot more in this area because GOOG has BRAND NAME, and advance technology, GOOG can do something damage to AAPL, which I think GOOG will seriously think about it. GOOG thinks big in CLOUD, look at the LOGO of GOOG CLOUD and smart phone PIXEL. We will see GOOG moves in a few quarters."
GOOG is continuing its stock buy back program (according to CFO Ruth Polat)... nice!

The interpretation of stock performance for last couple of days: GOOGL is nothing to do with trade war or Tariff! It is not your days!
"Regardless of my position in this, the conference call was amazing. Seriously this company is so well run, and a cash cow. They are diversifying into so many areas. They come out of the pandemic likely the strongest company in the world."
Amazon stock has outperformed the Google stock in the past 2 years. Going nowhere and slowing growth.
"“Monopolistic internet platforms like Google and Facebook are probably ‘too big to secure’ and are certainly ‘too big to trust’ blindly,” said Jeff Hauser, from the Centre for Economic and Policy Research.He argued that the US Federal Trade Commission should move toward “breaking these platforms up”."
Look at that.... market down GOOGL up..... manipulation at it grandest.
"You can tell that the traders move all their money from growth to value. This is one of the reason GOOG will have all time high this month. Look at MSFT which will introduce the new android smart phone, even confirms my believe GOOG will not even dominate but monopolize the future of the smart phone in the nest 5 years. GOOG has one special quality, a lot of cash and advance software that no body has."

COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE JOINING IN, THEY ALSO DON'T LIKE THE WAY THESE COMPANIES ARE STEALING YOUR RIGHTS"
"Technicals on GOOGL (3/26/18)""Market Edge Opinion - Avoid the stock. if you are long, close position or monitor stock closely. The current technical condition of GOOGL is weak. The underlying indicators are negative and a reversal of the existing trend seems unlikely at this time. The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bearish. GOOGL's chart formation indicates the stock is in a strong downward trend. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that GOOGL is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of GOOGL."""

Anyone selling before earnings than buying back? Thanks
I just sold some calls on Google and plan to put buy shares in a drawer and hold out for a few months look again later. Too frustrating to follow on a weekly basis
The real hate groups have exposed themselves. Flee from FB TWTR and Google! Using these companies or Being a part of these companies is like working for a modern day Hitler. 1st they control your speech then they start killing people that is the historical progression they are following.
This thing has been trading sideways foreeeevwrrrrrrrr
Thanks for the KPAY tip.
Insiders must know that they missed earnings. Stocks go up when they miss nowadays.
"Stock is up roughly 16% over the last 7 weeks, its down 4.5% and shorts are celebrating????? They really have low standard. ROTFL"
"in the last 6 months the stock is up over 500 points. If you are long, you can't complain much."
I don’t understand why the media is so negative in reporting results. Huge EPS beat despite the small miss on revenues. And much more clarity in breaking down the numbers.
Wagers on tomorrow...I say below 1100 at one point in the trading day.

"The media has hailed silicon valley exces as the 21st century captains of America industry. However, a closer look reveals a dark side with a definite anti-American slant:1. The continuous out-sourcing of jobs to Asia2. The use of diversity criteria in hiring and promotion, instead of using experience, qualification and education3. Secret non-recruit agreements like the one Apple, Google and Intel had for which they were fined $0.5 billion4. The use of off-shore tax havens to avoid paying taxes to the U.S.5. Using Asian sweat shops to manufacture cell phones and other electronic products or using child labor to mine cobalt for lithium batteries.6. Stifling of free thought or speech if it doesn't agree with the political or social views of the CEO.7. Closely held beliefs that foreign tech workers are better than American tech workersSo instead of captains of American industry, some of these silicon valley execs are more like the robber barons of the 20th century."

Good to see that Google is willing to settle. The day of reckoning with Netlist is coming soon. That federal appeals court judgement against Google in Netlists favor will have the stay lifted and an investor should ask Google when they are going to get this over with. Under Googles leadership they allowed this behavior and it looks like taking advantage of others is their culture. Making it right should be the direction under new leadership.

"Consumer Watchdog and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse filed a complaint Thursday regarding the alterations Google made to its privacy policy in June. The complaint, which was made public Monday, requested that the Federal Trade Commission review the matter. The privacy groups said the changes violate deceptive-practices law and a previous FTC order. The complaint involves Google’s June request for users to opt-in to new privacy settings that enable Google to combine browsing histories with search histories. The alteration reversed a 10-year-old policy at Google keep user data separate between its search and its DoubleClick business, the latter which aids advertisers in placing ads on third-party websites. “This announcement intentionally misled users, who had no way to discern from the wording that Google was breaking from a nearly decade-old practice and asking them if it could link their personal information to data reflecting their behavior on as many as 80 percent of the internet’s leading websites,” the complaint stated.The complaint continued, “A reasonable user would have been left with precisely the impression Google was seeking to leave: that the 2016 change was to their benefit and posed no risk to their privacy. In reality, the policy change marked the consummation of a deceptive path that Google had methodically charted since it first sought to acquire DoubleClick in 2007.”Google responded in a statement obtained by the Wall Street Journal on Monday. The company said that it changed the policy “to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” and that “it is 100 percent optional — if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.”The FTC has received the complaint and is “closely reviewing it,” per the Journal report. Google was harshly criticized when it acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2007. Privacy activists were concerned that the company would combine data from users’ search histories with browsing history to create “super profiles” of consumers. At the time of the deal, Google said it would keep DoubleClick data separate from data it collected through search, maps and Gmail.“Google is a serial privacy violator,” John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog’s Privacy Project Director, said in Monday’s press release. “For the last decade they pretended to care about your privacy, but amassed ever growing amounts of data about you. Remember, you’re not their customer. You are Google’s product.”"

I’m long GOOGL but I think profit taking is imminent. It’s gone up a lot very quickly.
I see some sour grapes below. Anyone see them?
Wouldn't Alphabet be a good fit with TikTok? It would seem YouTube and TikTok would have some synergies. Apologize if this conversation is on another thread...Long GOOG and GOOGL for a decade.

I’m new to Google stock and my question is what is the difference between the symbol GOOG & GOOGL
"getting away from Amazon, Twitter, FB, Apple was the easy part. Damn you Google, you are everywhere. I am working on it, though. It is just going to take some time."
"GOOG only gets better Q after Q, It's Mobile ads will get more than FB in term of dollars. FB has to fix the problem and bring back the investors, which I think at least another 2 quarters minimum. So I think GOOG should be my candidate for the next 2 months."

"An anonymous product manager filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Google of having an internal “spying program.”The lawsuit, filed in the San Francisco Superior Court, claims the Mountain View-based company violates California Labor Laws by maintaining strict confidentiality policies, according to a report out from The Information. The suit said that Google encourages employees to report fellow workers who leak information.The plaintiff also said the company threatens to fire anyone who leaks information and does not permit internal workplace discussion about wages or legal violations. Google goes so far as to prohibit employees from writing a novel about working at a tech company in Silicon Valley without the company’s permission, per the complaint.So what’s considered confidential material at Google? According to the lawsuit, confidential information is classified as ""everything at Google."" The policy allegedly prevents employees from talking about workplace conditions with the ""press, members of the investment community, partners, or anyone else outside of Google,"" per The Information.Google defended itself against accusations Monday.""We will defend this suit vigorously because it’s baseless,” a company spokesperson wrote in an email to Mashable. “We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information. Transparency is a huge part of our culture.""The spokesperson continued, ""Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns.""The ""John Doe"" who brought the suit is represented by the San Francisco employment law attorney Chris Baker, per court records. If found guilty of the 12 alleged violations of California's labor laws, Google could pay as much as $3.8 billion, with 75 percent of the penalty collected by the state and the rest distributed to Google's 65,000 employees, per The Verge. That would average to $14,600 per employee."

"Earnings were stellar, Goog vs Amzn both are near $800 and AMZN has .52 cents earnings and Goog has over $9 in earnings per quarter, do you see the value in GOOG and both are growing near 20%, albeit AMZN takes losses GOOG is more purdent and is fiscally responsible to their shareholders. AMZN share price is hard to figure out why its still so high. To grow revenues, Bezos comes up with clever ideas like Land on Mars, residencies in the ocean, buying off existing companies in India, china, europe with high stock price. So if you look at the Original Amazon, selling books, electronics, cds, etc. It probably never made a dime, today 50% of the sales are 3rd party sales, the profit solely comes from them and AWS cloud (which will face much more competition going fwd) thanks to GOOG, ORCL, MSFT and HP. I see a bright future for GOOG, I cannot say the same of AMZN."

"Please remind me, other than the overall stock market impact, how exactly is Google affected by a China virus?"
1200 + tomorrow pre market
"It is very good chance that GOOG will hit 1600 tomorrow. Who ever bought GOOG should put seat belt on, because GOOG will shoot up this afternoon. the whisper number is unbelievable."
Time to buy
"Much of the earnings will come from You Tube and Google search, which has over 32 % global market ads money share, and don't forget mobile ads expands over 20% in the five years. 5G will even make big ads spenders pour the budget into GOOG and FB even faster, because both companies have the biggest ecosystem, I call them TWIN MONOPOLY. The earnings on Monday will prove that I AM RIGHT."

any news as to why GOOG is tanking today?
Pre-market looks strong. Senate approves coronavirus relief package. Election year and the whole world in home-office. GOOG looking excellent.
"The big tech sell off is because of the upcoming presidential elections. It is also because of the September sell offs associated with what is known as the ""September effect"". Big tech will continue to go down for several months."
Google stole NLST Netlist's IP namely patent '912 & this made search servers 3x quicker since 2009 with memory technology developed by me & Netlist. Google made $750 billion with this & owes Netlist $12billion & that's a gift feel free to invest in Netlist opportunity
Did anyone notice all those big firms maintain or upgrade Goog
"GOOG WEATHERING THE STORM. ALSO, BUY TTD ON WEAKNESS."
"Bernie Sanders was asked about how the planet cannot handle the population growth. Instead of advocating the US pay for more abortions worldwide, he should have told young women not to be promiscuous.He should have also said how Artificial intelligence is going to be used. How AI is being programmed to understand that the primary cause of Earths problems is mankind, and too many people. And how companies like Google are creating algorithms so that in the future, the machines AI controls will be used to have a widespread drop in population. And when the genocide begins, Congress will ask google if it has programmed machines to reduce population, and Google will say No, its what the algorithms have produced. Rest assured. AI is being developed as the way to enable worldwide genocide."
"Somebody needs to de-thrown these search engine clowns. I remember 15 years ago when they were great. You could search ""My Chevy broke down in Arkansas""...and it would search trillions of files, and you would get word for word match for what you searched for...in someone's blog or whatever...it was 'word for word' results for your search. If you search ""My Chevy broke down in Arkansas"" now, all you get is Chevrolet ads. Google sucks."

"GOOG has been taking alot of deserved heat from President Trump and a few shows on FOX News (Carl Tuckerson has been really pointing a spotlight on them recently). Considering they have 90% of the search market I think the only thing the government can do (and who knows they probably ARE a part of the intelligence community), is to break them up. Just like they broke up AT&T and Standard Oil, the parts will be worth more then the whole. I expect more weakness with a probable move down to the 200 day moving average."
"It's always the game. The street knew GOOG missed earning that was why they push it up to the top to create a cushion for it falls back. It should be -$200, not just $90. It's price target is $1050 is the right place where it should belong."

Market may go green :-)
"GOOG was my best investment for 2018, bought at 1018 sold at 1187 on news on Euro fine. Threat to GOOG and MSFT is not as much to AAPL and FB."
Better grab all the mara and solo calls you can off this news!
Google will fall 100 points tomorrow this was a light beat
Down at least $20 tomorrow.
"what is the big deal, this is buy the dipper market so much money is floating around"
Yahoo deleted my post about the Morgan Stanley news coming out at 12:10 and CNBC not releasing the news for it to the public until minutes after hours
Google will be trading for 2200$ in no time. If Amazon can have insane multiples google can too
Let's take out $1300 and make it the new floor!!!!
"How about google, forcing its employees to goose step with the modern neo liberals. remember when liberals said and wrote horrible things, but their words were protected by the constitution. be careful. now its firing employees. soon it will be a swat team breaking down your door at 3:00 am, all because you don't think the way they want you to. Land of the Free. No. we are losing our freedom every day to these horrible people. These are the real deplorables."
Ever wonder what the world would have been like if the good guys won WW2?
Do you think...Opinion.... With world dominance in search... Leadership in AI... Open source cloud Dominance? Google should crush both Microsoft and Amazon????
"Cramer said things going lower, technical damage a huge hangover!! He says sell into gov market buying bounce with your gains you have them and raise cash!!"
I just pick some all Sept call. I think it is a good discount.
"GOOG is down over 26 points, it is good time to buy when it is down. NAFTA will be signed, market will go positive again. China will not be a problem, Trump can not squeeze her much, because Trump will be blamed to push China away into Putin's arm, which is a NO-NO for global politics. The reason is US will have to spend more on defense. WE ARE MORE THAN A TRILLION DOLLARS BUDGET DEFICIT!."
Way to go GOOG! onward and upward because 2000 is our goal
"Back to back green days for the 1st time since Feb. 4-5Opened 8.18 in the red. Go down 14.13.Only the 2nd time this year it ends green on a day it opened at least 8 in the red and low gets to 14The least Green day, 0.92, since 0.14 on June 15Up 5.68 for the week, down .32 for the month and up 80.44 for the year."
wont go past 1300 for a while
"The damages to Netlist from Googke violating is 912 patent is easily in excess of $10B. On top of that are treble damages amounting to $30B. They already have a big PR problem developing. In 200 cases, Google settled all of them out of court. The largest patent infringement case was $2.5B. This one will be epic and painful."
When will Google be fined for not paying their lawsuits in a timely manner?
Looks like $1112 close
You know the tech companies will beat forever - they lowered targets first
i like when prices are low. It gives me more opportunities to buy. still not low enough though.
GOOG is up in pre-market and ready to move north..... huge government-stimulus just around the corner..... HUGE..... whatever it takes......
Google was rated one of the best companies to work for
"What Google really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Google (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Google just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon. Read our last analysis and you’ll see.https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/40777835-gathon-capital/5495008-ge-qualcomm-ti-apple-should-acquire-ge-of-china-for-dirt-cheap-price-now https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/40777835-gathon-capital/5490372-ge-of-china-enjoyed-strong-profit-and-growth-amid-corona-virus-outbreak"
"looks like Softy just beat as well. Nadella talks big on cloud transformation, digital classroom, virtual teams... all sounds like Googles side businesses."
Trump and his non sense.
"""do no evil"" hahaha. I wonder if Netlist found that was the case after what Big G did to NLST's 912 patent? Will Big G settle or risk going in front of a jury for its sins to be displayed openly?"
$GOOGL actually going up as we speak
wondering how many shorts still exist. This is the best fang stock to own shares or calls on 
Always go up when I don't buy. Bank Lanmed
1100 here I am !!!
Heyyy what the hell is going on ! See premarket
googl might not have good earning
China should not allow GOOGL to enter China for the same reason of national security as USA does!

"Google is sitting on a pile of cash. It has a healthcare division, any idea if google in interested in pharmacy has amazon is? If there’s an interest, chances are google may buyout rite aid (RAD)."
Why isn't Google part of today's rally?
i bought some at the end of the day
going green
"Ex items, it's only 10.20 EPS"
so why would i buy GOOG over Googl? I did buy some shares of GOOGL yesterday for the first time since they are class A and read that was the way to go. I am open to buy some GOOG but wonder how you personally made the choice on which one?
the monthly routine. Finally the dip day of this month. will climb up in a couple of days. no big deal
Freedom of expression is not allowed at Google only gender pay discrimination is allowed.
Google has to pay NLST some real dough!
Let's see 1500 next week..GOOG has its pulse on the universe if any company does
I'd like to get into some GOOG. What's a good price entry?
GOOGL...the gift that just keeps on giving

Google March 2021
"Tech sector shows sign of strength. Keep an eye on AMZN, AAPL, then GOOG."
Clearly the Big boys are not impressed with something.They let you buy at high prices then it goes down...
GOOG could see 10% correction according to analyst!
Now pay Netlist!

Every editorial article is promoting left-wing causes and events."
What a disappointment
"It is so funny that EU would fine Google. EU does not even have it's house in order. I am sanguine it will be reversed. Meanwhile the shorts, the negativity spreading people and the depressing ones are having a field day. Well Google will end up higher today and for the week. Look if you own a car it is almost 100% chance that you will have some problem with it after 100,000 miles . So information highway is like that too. There are many candidates on the information highway and sometimes they may step on each others toes but the consumer benefits in the long run for efficiency and quickness and accuracy. But it will be reversed. Hungry EU is looking for MO Cheese (money) and that's that."
Time to retreat
"Holding Nov calls. Any views if I should see now or wait ? Any views if stock will cross 1,120 in a month or two ?"
I will wait until August 1st to buy Googl. Q2 revenue will be much worse than Q1.
GOOG definitely wanting north. Stock buy back program activated? Election year 2020 and the whole world working remotely. Should move up much more in the not too distant future...
below 1073.00 look for further downside with 1065.35 & 1051.50 as targets.
"Cancel Google and Alphabet; This censorship, communist, stinking search engine needs to be cancelled. Leave the alphabet to grade schoolers learning (or trying to learn) their A-B-C's."
GOOG is holding up the Nasdaq pretty much by its self... I would be big time concerted if it wasn't for the FED showing no signs of backing off feeding the markets!

Who's the hero that paid $1132?
J.P. Morgan raised it's price target on Alphabet (GOOGL) TO $1700
Financially strong tankers like Google with lots of very talented staff and management are oerfectly positioned for this environment.... and don‘t forget: 2020 is election year... Google is poised for massive growth and very innovative new applications and services....

Sell google!!! They are showing their fascists tendencies...
"Biden today said we have ""120 million dead from covid."" Then you could see that someone told him through his earpiece that it was just 120 thousand. But many of us think that 120 million was the goal, on the disease inflicted on us from China. So that the left would not need to form Death Squads when they nationalized everything. China is the country that google would rather work with than the US. Maybe google employees intentionally brought the disease back to the US. Whatever, if google prefers China and their lack of freedom over the US, then google is pure evil, and should be split up into about 40 pieces.https://community.oilprice.com/topic/19556-biden-came-out-of-his-basement-today-thursday-and-said-we-have-120-million-deaths-from-covid-19/"
new 52 week high. I'm loving it. I'm getting close to doubling my investment here.
whole system broken here. Need thousands of points sell off here. One big joke world wide with markets
GOOG looks like a good short at this price.Yes?
Google is the proud of us
"Google’s treatment of TVCs has come under increased scrutiny by the company’s full-time employees (FTEs) amid a nascent labor movement at the company, which has seen workers speak out about both their own working conditions and the morality of the work they perform.What's a TVC? Google it."
"Nothing but noise today, its going higher!!!"
I'm bargain shopping right now and just bought another 10 shares. Go long and stay strong
"Ha, miss!! told you mofoers she was OB. gratz to the weekly put buyers today."
how many of you think by Friday it'll be 1100?
Shorts trapped!
"GOOG just blew away earnings, raised guidance and now gets hit with China Tariffs news. GUESS WHAT? GOOG is NOT in CHINA and this will have no affect on top or bottom line. GREAT time to add to your positions."
"Look at the EPS, there will be upgrades tomorrow."
"it is the market makers try to squeeze the weak hand to let go. then bring it the big boys. Every body knows the anti trust case will take over 5 years, by the time GOOG is already 1500."
$55 Down just todayAt this rate 0 in 21 days!Does this make any sense to anyone who has some sense?Buy the #1 company in the entire planet when down like this. You will come out ahead!

Why Alpha couldn't play the trick that aapl and fb did?Something is fishy across the tech board.

Stock manipulated by banks and institutions at its best. When will they push the “sell all” button?
tommorow is going to be a bloodbath
Are Alphabet's top rats leaving a sinking ship? There are plenty of ongoing probes for this personal data-stealing company. Could it be that Google's founders want to escape the federal net? Brin and Page have enough money to start a new business while Alphabet sinks. It's probably time to break up Alphabet. Now is a good time for a 10% share price correction as Google's founders take flight. Big investors are starting to worry about succession instability. Alphabet is getting a bit too large and needs to be trimmed. So long Brin and Page. They're fed up and realize it's time to leave. Plenty of investors will feel the same way.
Google has become a #$+# show off a company. MSFT is the real deal.
Time to split 1:10...
"81.04% of Shares Held by Institutions, they are probably buying."
Like I have been saying we go green Monday. 60 Minutes was a non event. No body even really watches that old show anyway. Great company and great stock. We should see 1100 again soon!
"Google Being Exposed — Facing Fire of Bias against Conservative Sites. But Google’s CEO insists their algorithms fairly represent web traffic. AND there lies the rub.... read on (the missing link)Yes, Google search engines reach out to grab the most visited sites, but about 75% of those sights are liberal leaning, correlated to the number of ‘progressives’ in media today. So, Google’s search imbalance comes directly from the lack of ideological diversity in US media. Solution: Google could adjust it’s search engines to account for the heavy liberal overweighting.But, will Google do this? ..I doubt it.. Management at Google admit leaning strongly to the left, and have already demonstrated resistance, and a desire to algorithmically suppress conservative search.But what about conservative and libertarian demands for an unregulated and free market place? Answer; Google’s overwhelming 90% grip on market share of something so critical, news and information! —Google is simply too much of a monopoly."

"So tempting, ever so much. But I am unable to pull the GOOG buy trigger, or for that matter on any stock or index. The FED's desperate 50 basis point drop says a bunch about where this stock market may be headed next. IF a world wide recession including America happens, Trump is OUT no matter who he runs against. JMHO"

If you get in GOOGL GOOG today your next week will be fantastic most possibly.Both are itching at 100MA; any time soon both will break out and that day we will see 3-4% upward price move in both. Watch AMZN and NFLX -- They are dormant; but on breakout they are monsters.

Mega beat
FB just beat top and meet bottom... will see what happens when Zuck opens his mouth on CC but should be all clear for take off. FB closing in on 52w highs Google should quickly follow.
there must be good news that leaked out
Don't care why it is up. It was dragged and held down for too long for no good reason. Light at the end of at last.
What if we all short google and stop using it for a month? Are we gonna become rich?

Let’s see a little rally back to 1315 last hour!
"Why is this junk dropping so relentlessly? It took it all day to rise 23 points and it’s given all that back plus some. In the meantime, Gme, amc, spce and koss, stocks of companies with zero income, are on fire.This did not happen even five years ago."

"THE SKY IS FALLING, THE SKY IS FALLING....i'm looking outside at a grey sky, but it's not falling. Maybe just a little profit taking...."
All that spending GOOGL has been doing is going to lead to some nice profits/beats soon enough.
Tech work fromHome names peak pumling by cramer like he did in 2000. Gonna collapse so hard into year end. People with once in a millenia gains in literally months on these stocks are in for a hard hard lesson $zm $rng $amzn $googl $sq $twlo $nflx

It will be a very negative if GOOGL cannot get to $1100 today for earnings.

Needs to start paying a dividend. that would increase value.
"Here’s what one trader on StockTwits recently had to say in regards to GOOGL: • $GOOGL Roth Capital analyst Suji Desilva raised the firm's price target on Netlist (NLST) to $1.00 to $2.00 • This is after patent win against google and inphi, the buy rating is increased by many analysts $1-$4 After settlement with Google and Inphi, the stock price may shoot up to $10-$12 NLST shareholder for over 2 years now. All the talk about Google, let's not forget about Inphi. Netlist(NLST) WON 12 year old Patent case against GOOGLE and INPHI for 3 patents. (NLST). Expecting a huge settlement from GOOG and INPHI– around 2B+ in July"
"Now it looks like the Deep State is operating not only with intent, but attempted to cover it up. Maybe this is why he's hiding on his island.

"Not going anywhere, I'll stay with GOOGL for Long"
"I do not need google. Most searches I do work well elsewhere. What search engines do you like, use?"

it is extremely oversold! Today will reverse or we are in nasty correction!
"Just bought in today. Hoping to make some monies long term. I know they own 5% of SpaceX, so that would be big if they went public. Short term I'd like to see a stock split."
"Google cut tie with Huawei this will make it very difficult for Google to enter China market in the future, not to mention they’re going to lose a lot of advertising revenue from mobile consumers"
"Google still has to pay the damage award to Netlist for 10 years of knowingly infringing. That rule 36 judgement is not going away. Maybe these record damages will teach them a lesson.picked up from st.....From Google 10Q Report. Can be found on their IR website.We face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. We, like other internet, technology and media companies, hold large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us."
After-hours is $1‘280 and rising... GOOG has resumed the uptrend... $1‘500 coming in this election year...
FB just said Ads for first 3 weeks of April is roughly flat YOY. These are the worst weeks of the lockdown with 23M unemployment! That's really great news for Goog. Another sign big boys took the punch and is still standing.
"Clearly Google is one of the most powerful companies in the world along with berkshires, apple and amazons of the world but the issue is also this is the biggest bubble in the history of stock market anywhere in the world. If the market start to correct itself as expected. I am wonder what people will do to themselves after they lose their billions in paper money. Hoping for a soft landing instead of a big crash. I like small earthquakes to release the pressure instead of a 9.0 earthquake that destroy everything on its path."
"The Morgan Stanley analyst (Nowak) was fired at his prior firm (SIG) for always being too cautious. Looks like he learned how to the game works and to ""play ball"". Funny."

"What should I do with my profit sharing of 5,000 shares of Google? I am too young to retire. :-)"

great
Why the sudden huge drop?
Expect a pullback near 1920 in a month or so. That's the buy point.
trump announced major economic stimulus is on its way
GOOG P/E ratio seems little high per historical standards. The second half of 2018 will not be good for stocks as the market goes through a much needed correction to clean out all the fat. The trade war that kicks into full gear next week will accelerate the market correction. Take your profits and thank me later!!

uh-oh.... i see Double tops....
"The short position is tainting the spectacular results of Q1. Unfounded statements. Focus on the 28% yoy eps increase and the tax reform provision which allows cap ex to be recognized 100% in the year incurred. It was a prudent business decision to increase costs at this point in time. Data gathering and analysis, whether it's done by Google or your local grocery store is here to stay. I'd be surprised if Alphabet would be talked to by congress because there were so few political articles (sponsored by foreign entities) which appeared on their platform. 2018 eps seems to be headed toward 40 to 42 dollars. 1150 price target near term."
"Now is turn around time, at $2012"

"GOOG growth is not over. But GOOG is appropriately valued for the growth, cash and assets. This is the first time in years where GOOG lost almost 10 percent and it does look like a screaming buy.I am betting that the stock will be stuck in this price for the rest of the year. (In between 1050-1100)."

"The most simplest question for Google is, why is this taking 10+years to resolve. Is Chuck Hong the CEO of Netlist bullying Google,(not sure how that could happen) or is his technology bullying Google? Something is aloof here...."
What a run! I am in awe of GOOG getting its due
SHORT MORE MORE MORE
Finally $1500....Took months to get in there from their last peak.....
"Just like AMZN, slowly move higher day by day"
"I told you so that GOOG will go higher tomorrow when GOOG start the Cloud conference. The guy has credential from ORCL that is a guarantee to move GOOG into the position that can shake some ground by AI. GOOG is just too good, they will take advantage when AAPL stumbles this year which you can see the result in the first quarter which is a few weeks away."

Never bet against a juggernaut like GOOG.
"That was easy... strategy to buy before earnings and cha ching. SNAP, GOOG, MSFT. What a bull market! Making $$$ in the market hasn’t been this easy."
Volume is less than half the average which means nobody is interested in this stock
one good thing about $GOOG that its trading on a reasonable price area. you dont feel the risk and the urge to short from fear of the stock being readjusted to a reasonable territory by the market
The whole technology sector is due for a sharp rise during these coming months

Hold.
Scary investing at this time. Our votes no longer matter they just do what they want. There is no way Biden won this election. He couldn’t fill a HS gym and now we’re supposed to believe he got over 70 million votes? There were thousands of Trump supporters protesting in all 50 state Capitols yesterday yet hardly a mention of it in the fake news. I went to the one in CA and I saw about 10 people with cardboard Biden signs and thousands of Trump signs and the media reports it as two opposing groups? They are lying to us and at some point the people will rise up and I don’t want to be in the market when that happens.
don't panic...a month from now you won't even remember this .GOOG isn't going away
Alphabet is down 4.93% to 1822.64

What Trump said is not news to anyone. Of course they filter and control search results for a number of reasons. They show results that generate the most revenues and those that suit their political ideologies.

Always volatile but the trajectory is upward in a few days.
I am curious on people's opinions on this question: Do you think that when a company is being investigated by the AG of almost every state in the Union AND is also supposedly under investigation by the DOJ for anti-trust that they should be forced to stop all share buybacks? The outcome of these investigations are completely unknown and highly risky so it would seem that it is imprudent at best to be spending billions of dollars of shareholder money on repurchases until the outcome is known. Upvote if you think company should have to stop repurchases. Downvote if you think not. Thank you.

Anybody who doesn't think Google's stock share value isn't coming way down are kidding themselves because the central banks need that money to be on mainstream to drive up inflation.

If it's not, it should be TREASONOUS! for an official,AMERICAN, to be telling people how to get into the country, in a TIME of a dire emergency, it is also treasonous to be given away for free in a CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY, paid for by the people, top tier basic needs 2 people coming into this country who cannot speak the language, do not participate in our heritage, do not give back to the HAND that feed, clothes and shelter them, well Americans living here live without food they live without clothing and shelter , and you allow those coming into this country to send our monies back to their home countries, inflating their country, deflating, stag plating and creating great harm to our country society and people, all in the name of votes oh, it's a disgraceful display of patriotism and ABSOLUTELY a slap in the face to all of our forefathers, who wanted a place for people to come to work hard and give back to that same country the United States of America which is exactly why we have a constitution it's time we started following it.Press I for englishNavigate to people first to make them believe Remmy for PRESIDENT"
"When google swept the world with google search and adwords/adsense platforms, Microsoft, Yahoo tried copying it and miserable failed. However 10 years later google is repeating the same mistake. Amazon and Microsoft are clear winners in Cloud space. There is no scope for a third and cloud revenue for the top 2 public vendors will only go down from here. Google copying them will not make sense and is unbecoming of a search giant. What google should do instead is to get into Private/Hybrid/Multi cloud space and takeowr the enterprise world which is much bigger market than Public cloud."

"I hope that google makes an SEC filing, when they start promoting employees based on their skin color, and sexual preferences, and no longer value hard working, intelligent job doers. They need to warn investors.Poor decisions, bad advice, poor performance. Its all on the way. Its been here to a degree, but soon it will be like a sunami. And google doesnt care. They want us to think they are doing this for a small number of employees. But thats not the real reason. They love China, and will sacrifice anything, including profits, for them. Instead of finishing their current work assignment, think of all the google employees who are thinking about what gender they want to be during their next break."
I add Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in my warning list and you should too.

"As I strong Ballard longtime holder, I have been trying to warn you all, this red flow is not over by a long shot and it is based solely on Coronavirus (global trade, tourism you name it).

I have sold the remaining 50% of all my holdings yesterday and have cash on the sidelines. I know I can’t pick the bottom but Dow, TSX and other global indexes are in a bit of a free fall unfortunately and I am not even going to buy lots down this time till I see coronavirus contagion halt and reverse."
"Thanks God, GOOG comes back. It is supposed to go up 50 points yesterday, now a lot of hedge fund managers change their mind not to worry about the huge Capex, I already mention that Scare money never makes money. So, GOOG puts serious amount of money in order to catch up AMZN ON THE CLOUD. Let's me remind you about PIXEL4, if GOOG equips QCOM chip 5G, AAPL better watches out."

I picked up 200 shares at 907 a couple weeks ago. just buying on the dips and loving it.Goog is my go to stock - incredible company.
This is going down the drain after hours. Missed earnings and guidance will be horrible.Millions of advertisers around world halted completely. Next 12 months will be a nice buying oppt for those that can wait long term for a bounce
"I hold shares in both GOOG and NLST and I'm pretty upset about this situation. Will probably dump my GOOG shares in order to support NLST more than I already am. Willful theft of IP is as low as it gets but GOOG lawyers lying to a federal court, stealing NLST 912 tech, renaming it and then selling it all over the world? Wow. Can't support GOOG anymore. Selling at the open. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. You belong in prison IMO because you never would have been GOOG without stealing NLST IP. Total #$%$ you are and I do not invest in #$%$bags."
IT WONT GO TO 1930 SHORT IT
Geez. The shorts come out at night. It means GOOGL is going higher. Bank on it.

They had some interesting insights about GOOG on http://greatpix.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I bought GOOG @ 88 bucks years ago and now my latest buy is LX. I see LX being China's answer to VISA and works like AMZN except they finance the product purchase with their own credit program. Check out their projected earnings from the latest news post. I know my stocks. Buy LX

"Storm's a coming, batten down the hatches. Who thinks China will cave into Trump's demands? I agree with Trump that China rips us off, but Xi Ping isn't running for office in 2020 and Xi Ping doesn't have ratings to deal with. If Trump moves ahead with his trade threats you'll see December all over again. Americans want instant gratification - we don't deal well with short term pain."
Google is supposedly looking into acquiring DOGECOIN or taking a majority stake in the currency! Here we go!
At least there is no huge drop. $50 is nothing to be alarmed of for a $1400+ stock.
GOOGL reached an all time high at 2065.00
"There could be more anti trust law suits. Moreover, there will be an impact of their reprimand for antitrust lowering the future earnings. Moreover, internet based companies all over the world will face head winds as governments require them to pay their fair share of the taxes.The Google parent company reported $3.2 billion in net income for the quarter, which works out to $4.54 a share, down from $5.01 a share a year ago, when the company also dealt with a big antitrust fine from the EU. Without the fine, Alphabet would have reported earnings of $11.75 a share, the company said, well higher than analysts’ average estimate of $9.64 a share, according to FactSet."

With over 110 billion cash Google will be announcing a new stock buyback program any time. Could easily see a big increase from last years 8 billion buyback. 25 billion would be nice

I don’t see why this quarter wouldn’t be good. However if they don’t give guidance that could cause a temporary selloff. Nevertheless I expect GOOGL to take out 2000 before the midpoint of this year.

"By third Q, when GOOG puts more money on PIXEL 4, with 5 G, you will see the number of PIXEL explodes up. China and Asia needs 5 G more than any thing right now, which I think GOOG will take advantage over I-PHONE,just 6 months which is long enough to bury I-PHONE for ever. I-PHONE will have the sales number down this year, no matter what. I guess GOOG will put PIXEL 4 in the hand of consumer as much as possible in order to get more mobile ads revenue from Google Search, Google MAP, and big gun You Tube."

Nice buy-in price point. Sure it could dip a bit lower on the talk from the EU of anti-monopoly but Google isn't going anywhere. This will come roaring back.
God bless president Trump for the buying opportunities! $$$ Stay long with Google! $$$$
"Simple; this is by far the best and most used search engine. Their R&D $$$ are also far outpacing competition. So go long on this. HOWEVER, they will miss coming Earnings Expectations, then go down vs Chinese tech now undervalued and recovering at outstanding pace thanks to China GDP wake up call.

Biggest asset bubble in US history created by the criminal FED bankers. gold and silver are money.

"not high quality earnings. just read through the earnings report. unfortunately, Googl stock will trickle down this week."
All u people areWay way tooOverbullish on big tech here $googl $amzn $shop$aapl$msft Bubble
This is a bizzaro world where missed earnings are rewarded and terrible economic data creates unjustified market rallys!
Beat revenue and not earnings.Conference call will be tough. Remember 2/3 of this had not much coronavirus effects and this consensus had already been lowered

"Now it is about to dip in GOOG. I wait to dip because I see AMZN,FB do not go down like GOOG"
If congress would do their freeking job. Google would not even think about being a slave owner
actually the best stock on the market is google. even it goes down it bounces back up. google is the safest stock of Wal street
"Amzn need to come down,while GOOGL need to go up to greet each other...1150 in first wk of march"
Time to sell. Up $4 after hours is a big tell to sell
Hope some of you picked up some cheap PM. In at 1172 25 shares. Was going for 50 but did not. Thank you Mr. Pres for opening your mouth as usual and killed futures. That's when you buy Googl or SPXL. It works every time-almost.
Added much more to my portfolio
beautiful rise!
Why won't this stock split? Seems like it would bring in more buyers.
The best president since Ronald Reagan
US today...too much power in the hands of very few.

this Google company may have some potential
Last night sold at 1101 - cool!
Google now controls 89% of search. Antitrust suit highly likely.
Goog is heading for $1400 by sept 1 just fyi
im a buyer at 300
it was +$23 in the morning?? what is going on?
"GOOGL dropped more than any other FAANG stock and has under performed all FANNG stocks in the last couple of years. Time for a real CEO to take over, kids days are over!"
Beat and stock down :(
The more it goes down the more I win!
"$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $GOOGLTalk about inflation? FAANG along with the rest of the stock market is inflated.

Time to buy major fear in market but google at 200 day sma ema
GO BABY GO!
DONT BUY DONT BUY SHORT TAKE PROFIT
Loon lmao! I can’t believe they actually did that. How desperate they must be to get the internet into the tiny towns and villages that are still at peace with the world.
I love how the CEO's are trying to politely tell these senators that the reason the employee base is more left because they are smarter on the whole than the conservative cohort :P Remember these companies only hire the smartest people in the world...it is harder to get a job at google than it is to get into a ivy league school.
This ship is sinking. 
This could close in the green.
"Google AI's latest 3D data set, 15,000 gifs, 4 million images, let AR dominate your life."
"Down today in direct unison with AMZN and Nasdaq, but we need some institutional buying."
"Enterprise value now only 15.2 times operating cash flow. That is a bargain. After tax profit growth is the same percent, 20%, Q4 2019 vs 2018, that is the same as AAPL."
"Hang in there, this will drop soon"
EVEN AAPL is much better options player than laggard GOOGL!
"Keep in mind if new government regulations come into play, that is what Google is worried about along with FB and others, And Google's costs could jump further if governments globally follow through on growing threats to rein in the ability of apps to track users for advertising purposes. Other regulators have discussed forcing companies to step up monitoring of user content."

"Dan Niles just on CNBC says Google totally immune from China tariffs issue since they don't do business in China. Apparently Mr. Niles doesn't know that Google gets MORE than half of its revenue from outside the U.S and that there is also a tariff issue with the EU, Canada, Mexico, etc. And if the worldwide economy starts to suffer because of the slower growth due to a tariff war then lots of Google revenue will be at risk. Mr. Niles is not that stupid (I hope) so we can only assume it is just another CNBC guest talking their own book up."
back to 1180 tomorrow
GOOG upgraded got $1600. Slow and steady. Don’t miss out on SHOP under $800!

AMZN now bigger than GOOG go figure.
Sold all my google today because once a company disappoints it never comes back
Roku on today's earning report said advertisement the last month of this quarter is down 90%. Their share price is down 10% in AH. Nobody is paying for advertisement. This is the new Covid 19 era. We will see Google make the same call on the next earnings report.
"Hello everyone! if by chance you have time and desire to discover a mini Netflix that already collaborates with GOOGL I suggest you put in your watchlist CIDM very under rated stock with great potential now below 2$.

Looks like a $1060 close
"If you guys would buy instead of short, you could stop worrying so much."
Up 1-2% monday $amzn $googl $fb deep state prop to hurt the parlor posters egos even more these people dont get it the dems are deepstate and technocracy. Censorship helps these companies retain power and higher stock prices. Sad but true
options suggest it will be 5-7% move either side. Great time to play straddle.

"When will these fools in Big Govt realize Anti-Trust for the wrong reasons only makes the same company they go after stronger? Standard Oil, At&t, Microsoft. All 3 victories were claimed until the newspaper ink dried, then it's a win win for current shareholders. My main holding is . Big Govt wants to break them up w/GoOGLe+FB. Again go for it! While the short term pain of hearings will cause sell off, once the pie(s) are separated and the new companies settle in? My ""main"" holding will turn into 3-4 little main holdings. All it will do to me is give tremendous value to currently owned shares, so I say go for it! Please make me rich!"

Apparently being sued by the federal government and likely being liable for billions of dollars (let alone getting broken up) is great for your stock price. What a scam.
PP seems discount coronavirus. The market will continue to go down next week. Believe it!
No one is taking risk to buy at 1117... sure below 1100 soon

"One of the so-called ""safe stocks"" to hold onto or buy.Bullish."

OH NO... People in a company have opinions on things!!!!! the sky is falling! RUN!!!
I use Firefox and Duckduckgo. Duckduckgo is the best search engine. they don't track or constantly shove adds in your face
I think everybody use google everyday
"The stock market cares about the economy, interest rates, and Trade deals. It could care less about Impeachment, as we already know the outcome. As AOC herself stated, the impeachment is really about the next election, not the actual impeachment itself. The Democrats have been determined to remove Trump since election night. I still remember the Trump-Hillary debate question posed to ONLY Trump - will you accept defeat? Trump boldly made it clear he wouldn't be facing that concern. Meanwhile, it has been the Democrats who could not handle defeat. Just my observations! Counter opinions welcomed."
i bought a few more shares
What time are the earnings
"3 Day Rule gone, don't buy for 3 days after Bad News."
Thumbs up if you got washed for shorting.
"It’s new tool Google-meet ,a videoconferencing tool and bullish market,150 + in a wk is not far fetched"
"Selling for only 21 times next years profits. Cheap. This has to rebound, and am guessing it starts tomorrow. I understand the crazy-PE stocks getting whacked, but this got hit harder than it should have and I expect the market will correct that."
Didn’t Google just get upgraded with $2500 price target by MS on August 29th?
Just bought more on the dip. This stock was this price one year ago and earns $46 per share since. WOW.
take profits and buy FB into their er wednesfay!
Google advertising seems to be a mess according to small publishers nothing seems to be working wouldn't be surprised to see an earnings miss
"So this company goes public in August 2004....and 16 years later they still have not paid out a dividend. Amazing. Isnt the future distribution of earnings supposed to be what determines value? They need to change what they teach in MBA school. In fact, whatever you do, do NOT pay dividends and grow as fast as possible so no net profit....i.e. no taxes. Make yourself fabulously wealthy by giving yourself employee options. So who needs to pay dividends or taxes? Not Amazon. Google does some....so they need to spend more. Go buy a company. Heck, they could buy all of Boeing right now for spare pocket change....or Ford for pennies...if they want to get into the self driving car game in a big way...cheap. I think these big companies making money right now...Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple...can take over the world, buying up the energy companies, utilities, auto, even some banks."
So when is Google going to pay their fines for stealing other's property?
Never underestimate the power of the industry titans.
This is an easy two bagger by end of summer at latest..
GOOG 10 shares. BABA 100 shares = 1 million ten years
"Great opportunity to add shares folks, it will close near green if not green...shorts trap!! $1800 within 6-12 weeks."
1600 fast
Did I tell you GOOG will drop like a rock after earning?
Will GOOG go past 2000 after earnings or???

What do you guys think about tomorrow’s earnings?
1186 was the old high ... so this is not much
"Unfortunately, it is a Monopoly and needs regulated."
"Not a big miss, but the manipulate is bad"
Sentiment dropped below historical bottom in January according to proprietary sentiment index by state street. It only goes up from here with strong historical trend if mean reversion. Don’t bet against it. The money lost preparing for the next recession or bear market is usually more than the money actually lost in correction. Market timing is a fool’s game for long-term or even short-term investors. My opinion only.
Up day tomorrow
Food stamps won't get GOOG to $1400
"Will be $1,000 very soon"
"I bought GOOG when it was at 666. My biggest holding a $500k at the time. I'm pretty happy, but man, I could bought Amazon for almost the same price. Serenity now, be thankful for what you have because there's always someone with more."
Very good news from the Fed
"U.S will make a good deal with China soon, Google will go up a lot in just one month!"
the only reason it did bad was that 1.7bill fine from Europe
GOOGL will clear $1300 today.
It's July 12th 2020 and Google still has not paid Netlist for the IP they stole 10 years ago. It was litigated through the patent court and upheld by the appeals court with a nonprecedential rule 36 judgement in Netlists favor. Time to pay up Google
this quarter was fine. if things went up in a straight line brokers wouldn't make any money buying and selling.just buy good companies that make money and be patient. goog falls into that category.
Ever onward and upward GOOG! We're with you all the way.
"Cheers to the 20% Nice Gain In President Trumps Booming US Economy and Stock Market since Jan.1, 2019."

"Nice, google just got an upgrade!"
No one ever seems to talk about how much Google is benefitting from online learning.
Google is still undervalued
"%29 drop in revenue. Wow just wow. Gotta congrats FB, AMZN and AAPL they managed to grow. Guys in case you haven't noticed we pay premium for the GROWTH some of you may find 5-6 EPS appealing but we pay 1500 bucks for a share. I expect a slight climb then I am gone"

"Mike Lohr, has set new target price of $1790.00 per share!"
GOOG going up more and more:-) please continue!
beginning of Bear Market- seen it before. Investors will scoop stocks like this as they go down - eventually there will be no more buyers
"Think if pandemic 's over as high possibility that vaccine would be available by the end of this November, then next quarter GOOGL won't due any good with its next earning report ....as less at home activity...."

"If men and women are equal then explain why when a man gets kicked in the nuts he never wants that experience again. Yet a woman has a baby and says that was fun I think I will have another. Yes, women are stronger than men when it comes to pain!"
"Who is lucky to get GOOG at -6 points? GOOG will hit all new high when it reports the earnings. GOOG gets stronger in every aspect. Youtube is the best, Search and Map get more ads. because GOOG dominates more than 95% of the market share. Hardware sector will show strength and start to take market share from both Samsung and I-phone. Home security and Home Assistance start to compete with AMZN head to head, which I think GOOG will surge ahead by end of the year."

weak longs gonna cause a waterfall this week
GOOG and MSFT hold the future in their hands.
I fully expect a nasty selloff no matter what the results. I also fully expect to sell none of my shares at any point in the next ten years.
Facebook is tanking...
Well this removes any questions I have about installing ADT ... why would I want to have my privacy invaded and then sold to anyone/any company????!!!
Market might close in red today..under 1500 for google
"I'm buying more Monday, no brainer way to low for NO reason, It is a gift"
all the bears on this board aren't cognizant that GOOG is on every platform and every device used by millions across the globe daily
"The forgotten FAANG. I think this will jump on earnings. They have their heads down and are ""doing the work"" while everyone else seems to want the spotlight."
Guggenheim is the only one that lowered its target in a sea of upgrades and the stock sells off. Its crazy how stocks always react to the negativity more than the positive side
Cisco will take the market down tomorrow and makes a great buying ops to buy GOOG at a discount
this is going up! The whole market is going up!
Will the 200 day hold? If not next support December low. Hmmm
i bought googl at the wrong time but i only own 15 shares
"The after hours manipulators will clean up, then give the scraps to the amateurs regular hours."
If this gets to $2080. I'll do this
why goog and amzn.down after earning destroy all market.those stocks are up 1000 percent or more in recent years with all faang stocks and many tech companies .while many other sectors and stocks are down like drug companies down 70 percent liky myl teva and prgo.so why if faang stocks are down other stocks are also down it should be opposite other beaten down stocks must go up.market rotation that was always.but recent years are abnormal.some sectors like drug companies are down more than 2008

Amazing earnings but it seems that we will have a heavy sell of tomorrow. Will be back at 1890s. Peope will book profits in such volatile maket.
"I might be wrong, GOOGL may go below $1100 tomorrow and not by Friday."
"Hey, Maybe Yahoo will have a comeback!?!?!? This is the time for a new youtube to rise. It will happen if they silence more normal people. It's kind of embarrassing, IMO and shows their lack of scope on reality."

"Google?s search engine has been corrupted by its politics. Who wants a biased search engine? NO ONE! It reminds me of the #$%$ ?fact-checker?

No more being directed AWAY from what you?re trying to find!"

Hey guys can you enlighten me why Google keep increasing? Their revenue growth has been decreasing for years and now with corona it became negative. So can you tell me why it is trading such a high valuation?
guidance is lower. andddd its red.
GOOG will have a big bounce!!! GO GOOG GO!!!
Should be safe to buy now.
GOOG has a lot to catch-up..... great start today.... much more to come in this election year....
Its a buy here
A close above 2100 and this tickets higher next week
"People really should switch their money from GOOGL to AMZN. In the near future, more companies will cut their advertisement budgets while more consumers will switch to online shopping. People will buy from AMZN no matter what. But advertisement is non-essential which could drop to zero if Covid 19 crisis extends to next two winters without vaccine."
"this is good buy around 900 to 1000 which will happen i feel, however no one can say if it goes down more, since corona is something we are seeing after 1918 spanish flu...so tuff times ahead."
GOOGL is up 4.91% to 1872.00
"Bb squeeze, PSAR below the price, and the fast is crossing the slow on the MACD?!!?!! Letssss gooooooo up baby"
Maybe their earning is so bad that they have to include other earning to make it look good?
"We own a Franchising company, if we don't advertise on Google our per store revenue drops by 33%, any questions?"
The people that write history books will have a difficult time finding anything nice to say about Obama. It will be even more difficult for them to find anything nice to say about Hillary Clinton. And George Soros owned the Clinton’s and Obama’s.
My gut feeling is stock will get green towards close
Cold DARK winter with Biden OR CLEAR skies with Trump? I'm going with Clear Skies!!!
good news for goog:https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/tech-google-fined-169-billion-for-illegal-online-ad-practices-200153767.html

Is it true that in googled 10q they set aside money for a big payment for lawsuit to netlist
"wish i could be buying rt nowDont worry guys, this is just institutions cashing in on profit, earnings report was good. Stick to fundamentals. This is why i bought a 25 day call cause I had a feeling there would be AH games being played."
"In my opinion, google will beat .Google is not like Amazon who's into retail shipping.Google derives its revenues mostly from advertizing.You can compare it to FB, who also derives its earnings from advertizing.FB flew high after his earnings. So will GOOG."
Whole stock market so over priced still. Nasdaq needs thousands of points sell off here. All bad news still with virus period. Getting worse period here.
Never bet against GOOG: ubiquitous cyber juggernaut

Investigation! Ha! They have already had one with no charges and will again. There is nothing to charge it’s just due diligence checks.
It’s the Coca Cola of technology.People use it every day and it’s not going to stop. Big growth coming for Google. Nice and steady.

"They started to demonetize Steven Crowder, a conservative comedian, and this will lead to a lot of their demise because I see them blocking more if they blocked Steven Crowder.

These Silicon Valley, revenge of the nerd, types do no understand reality and live in a tech nerd bubble. The more power the government has the more power they have. Well, many don't want more government, more sensorship, and more rules. They are a publisher, now, in my opinion, and Youtube will have a strong rival in the coming years. Guaranteed! Because free speech always wins!"

"“There is a lot of talk about ‘never again,’ but this is impossible if we don’t remember what happened back then,” said Joachim Ronneberg, recipient of Norway’s highest decoration for military gallantry, the War Cross with Sword; the Distinguished Service Order from Britain; the Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre from France; and the American Medal of Freedom With Silver Palm. A member of the Norwegian underground he fought against fascism in WWII. Today we are fighting a resurgence of fascist ideology in the form of Trumpism. We must not forget, we must understand the danger and honor their sacrifice.""-- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."""
